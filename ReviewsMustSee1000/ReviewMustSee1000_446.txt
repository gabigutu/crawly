		<shortDescription>The all-seeing eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the Bourne series raises the bar for action films, and audiences balk at two-plus hour runtimes, the filmmakers of Vantage Point seem like they are trying to bring a fresh, new, unconventional take on the action/thriller genre. Though it may annoy some people, I felt the new take turns Vantage Point into a taut terrorist thriller.The new take or approach is jumping right into the moment (everything is already planned out, people and weapons in place, etc.) of the action and then telling it from eight different points of view. This is where some people may be mildly irritated because after you see one point of view everything is suddenly rewound and shown from the next person's point of view (this is done six times) before they all converge into a thrilling finale filled with one massive adrenaline-fuelled car/chase sequence.Because of the complex twists and turns of the plot and characters I will be brief, very brief actually, on the plot. It starts with a TV network covering a large gathering of leaders from all over the world (including the President of the United States) who have come together to form an alliance against the war on terror. At the beginning of this meeting the US president is assassinated as he takes the stage, and it begins replaying the assassination through all the different points of view. The editing must be commended in this film as it blends all the points of views so sophisticatedly you cannot help being engrossed, and the star-studded cast includes Dennis Quaid, Mathew Fox, Forest Whitaker, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver simply adds to everything.In the theater I was watching some people called out their annoyance of "again?!" on the fifth rewind, which I find amusing as the filmmakers are simply trying to come up with something new in these sequel-ridden times. And probably as those same people say Hollywood is "out of ideas" they get angry when it tries something "different" and would rather go spend their money on Spider-man 8.I felt Vantage Point was an intelligent thriller, and yes it had its' share of implausible plot points, but these were minor as the new technique makes you feel like you have an all-seeing surveillance system. I kind of felt like I was putting a puzzle together, piece by piece, and as you see a new point of view it adds more to the story and just when you think you have it figured out it changes again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good from my vantage point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I went into the theatre interested, but skeptical. Slowly, I got drawn into things, and by the time the we were at the fourth vantage point, I was fascinated by how all the stories interrelated with each other, and wondering the story would end up.The acting is uniformly excellent, especially that of Dennis Quaid, who I had previously considered a mostly comic actor, but is very convincing here as a Secret Service agent.The direction and script are also excellent, especially when you consider both are first-timers in the world of feature films. The script was not without its clichés, but I didn't see most of the plot twists coming, which I can usually spot coming a mile away in a film like this. There was one real groaner of a plot twist that you'd have to be an idiot not to see, but it goes by so fast that it doesn't really matter.A lot of the audience in the screening I was at got frustrated by the repeated sections, obviously having no attention span. But once the third act of the film kicks into gear, everybody stopped complaining.Speaking of which, the third act is the payoff which we've all been waiting for. Seeing all the plot threads converge in such a convincing matter was nice, as was the final action scene, which seems like it was plucked right out of one of the Bourne films. This comes as little surprise, since director Pete Travis and Bourne series director Paul Greengrass have worked together in the past.As skeptical as I had gone in, I came out impressed. Not since The Bourne Ultimatum have I seen such a convincing, engrossing action thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a gimmick film that delivers what it promises.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? This film is a gimmick film that relates the same event through the eyes of eight different characters that each hold a piece of the puzzle. The film stops and rewinds back to 20 minutes before the event for each character. It gets a little annoying because each time it stops, the audience is left on a cliffhanger which carries the film's tension into the next character.As for what the film promises, it promises a good puzzle, suspense and intense action. It delivers on all accounts. This plot has twists and turns and is completely logical. Half way through this movie, if you think you got it all figured out, you haven't got a clue.The action is fairly balanced through out the film and keeps the film moving. The car chase in this film is one of the better ones I have seen in a long long time. It had some shots in it that I think were a small homage of the original The Italian Job (1969) car chase scene.Even though I personally thought that some of the characters were paper thin, many of the actors gave strong performances that made the characters believable. Forest Whitaker was the best. I had a little problem with Dennis Quaid's character, Secret Service Agent Thomas Barnes, starting out as the thinnest of all the characters but he grows in the film. Of course, Edgar Ramirez, Sa?d Taghmaoui, and Eduardo Noriega were right on and make the film (but not as much as Whitaker).The premise of this film makes a refreshing change from the ordinary style of mainstream movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Concept With Mediocre Execution.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point tells the story of the assassination of the president of the United States from 8 different viewpoints. We see the people trying to protect the president, the media, civilians and the people taking out the attack.Vantage Point's is Rashomon for today's audience, minus the talent and brilliance. The whole idea behind of Vantage Point is to tell the audience that everyone has their own perspective on things when in a crisis situation, then of course at the end it decides to tell us the whole story. This concept is really intriguing and could make a really intense action thriller. Vantage Point is indeed tense at times and has a really great car chase sequence, but the absurd plot and useless sub plots are too much for it's own good. It feels as if the film is trying to be to smart for it's own good.We start off from the viewpoint of Sigourney Weaver and the media. She is the director of the station that is broadcasting the president. This is the perfect way to open the film because it is the closest thing that we, watching on TV at home, will get to see. The only information we know is what is shown to us. Bang, the president is shot, boom the stage explodes and then the film rewinds 23 minutes earlier to 12:00 noon and now we are seeing the event through the eyes of Dennis Quaid, one of the secret service agents protecting the president. The film tells everyone view in about 15 minutes or less, then rewinds to noon every time and then goes to another character. IT becomes very redundant and will no doubt get on people's nerves.This is why the execution is not as good as it could have been. It could have been a new and innovative way of seeing things, but instead we literally see the events rewind and the clock strike noon 8 times. As repetitive as this is, it does keep things moving along nicely. The film never moves at a snails pace and it shouldn't. Since we know what happens, we sit there waiting for these things to happen every time. During Whitakers viewpoint I found myself sitting their simply waiting for the explosion to happen so it can get on with the story.There are a lot of things going on in Vantage Point...a lot of things. Double crossers are being double crossed, think of the movie Heist. There are also dozens of characters, characters we never get to know. We get a quick back story on Quaid and know he 'took a bullet' for the president sometime ago and now he's back and that Whitaker has a family back in the States, but other then that we never get to know any of these characters or any explanation for their actions. Then again, that is the point of this movie. So it's safe to say the whole point of this movie is also its weakness.That weakness is because of the script. There are many times when you have to throw logic out the window here, just to buy some of the things that happen. While the car chase scene is quite thrilling it would never ever happen. For one the streets are way to narrow and populated for these cars to be swerving in and out of. Also one of the vehicles takes a beating, yet keeps on ticking. It takes a giant truck to finally put it to rest. The subplots don't add anything to the film either. One character is doing things because the bad guys have his brother hostage. This subplot could have easily been taken out of the story and nothing would have changed. All you need to do is make the one guy simply be a bad guy instead of trying to save his brother and the same tasks can be taken out.Vantage Point is not a bad film. Like Jumper I tried to like it, but there are just too many things about it that hurt it. It tries it's hardest to come off as a smart action thriller, but it's faults are too much to be forgiven. Enjoyment can be had, if you're willing to not take anything it shows you to be based on a certain reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take it for what it is, a good, entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some reviewers make it out to almost be a B-movie, but it isn't, not by a long shot.The story revolves around the assassination of the US president who is attending a counter-terrorism summit in Spain. The film is told from multiple viewpoints and the events that transpire within a 23-minute time frame, thus a Groundhog Day-like experience.Vantage Point is really just an action film . . . pure and simple. When seeing this film, don't expect a complex and deep storyline; it certainly isn't that. The proper approach is to just take it for what it is. I liked this film because it had no pretensions. It didn't want to pretend that it needs to be over-analyzed by the viewer. There are no lengthy sub-plots and behind-the-back conspiracy pieces, no need to explain who is fighting for what cause. And if you approach with this frame of mind, then I assure you, you won't get bored or disappointed.It's a movie that doesn't need to be analyzed ad nauseam. It doesn't care about needing to tie up lose ends and explain all the circumstances surrounding the assassination. Approach it from *that* "vantage point" and you'll appreciate it more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good concept gone awry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One crime, multiple vantage points. Sounds cool right? Yes. But "Vantage Point" never really pulls it off quite how it sets itself up to. The result is a cool action flick with some clever storytelling that sort of fizzles in the end.In "Vantage Point," the President of the United States (William Hurt) arrives in Salamanca, Spain to give a speech on global terrorism efforts and ties with Spain to improve them. He gets shot and then a bomb goes off killing many people. We get this story through the eyes of a variety of characters and by the end of the film know exactly what happened.The cast is a solid mix of familiar and old faces. Dennis Quaid, Forest Whitaker, William Hurt, Matthew Fox (of LOST fame) and even Sigorney Weaver give this film the star power it requires. The terrorists are entirely new faces, which is no real surprise.As the film first presents the vantage point concept, the first thirty or forty-five minutes develop a redundancy. You do get many new perspectives, but seeing the same events happen over and over again and the cheesy rewind sequences to establish a change in POV really gets a bit boring. Sometimes you're not really seeing something new, just the same old thing in a new way that doesn't really bring more insight into the plot. Sometime it does and it really helps the film, but mostly it's not the vantage points, but cutting the story off at pivotal moments and clues into the mystery so that when they're revealed in another perspective you can get excited. It's just good storytelling, nothing unique.The film really loses its appeal, however, with the "final perspective." In fact, it's not really anyone's perspective. The writers sort of realized that adding five more perspectives to reveal the full mystery (which is what it would have taken) would really bother viewers and get absurdly repetitive, so they combined them all into a final twenty minute action sequence that is like any other normal action movie. Was deviating from the concept in order to please viewers and keep the film short the best course of action? For this film, yes. Sticking to the concept would have made it bad considering the complexity of the plot. But even the ending can also be seen about 15 minutes prior to when it happens, so it's not really all that great. This film would have been better, however, if it could both stay true to the structural concept and please the viewer, which means first-time writer Barry Levy stretched his idea just a bit too far. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to watch it during an event of a company I work for. I really enjoyed this movie, because of it's editing, wonderful actors and full packed action.The movie tells the same story from 8 different persepectives, most of them from a character view, makes the puzzle clear till the end. Some puzzle parts can be guessed but this makes the movie so fun to watch.Matthew fox acting could be better, but the others are convincing. Cheers to Ayelet Zorer, an Israeli actress who surprises again with her beauty and acting.If you like thriller, action and car chases all in same movie then this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Clichéd Mess That Loses Direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The start of "Vantage Point" was so good that it actually got my hopes up as I thought I was going to be in for a good action thriller. It's too bad that after the assassination of the President (William Hurt) shown through the scope of a CNN type cable News broadcast (GNN- instead of a "C" it has a "G." Get it? CNN? GNN?) the story is pretty much over, so they add some action scenes and car chases because they're all out of ideas. Sigourney Weaver is very good in this five minute opening scene that throws us directly into the fire without any set up once so ever. It's just? BAM!! Even though we know what's coming- which is routine throughout the film- it's still a very effective start. Then, we get the same thing played back to us over and over again from a large quantity of people's perspective. Instead of becoming interesting it becomes boring and trivial. It's no longer effective. We've seen it all and we become increasingly more impatient. Even though everything is always not what it seems, and everyone is always looking at same thing and seeing something different we know where the film is going, but it drags in getting there.The trailer gives away one of the huge plot twists in the film (I think there was supposed to be another, but that could also be seen from a mile away. Think- Rogue. Cliché? You bet.). The President used a double and it was he who was shot. Did the double die? We'll never know. I think the writer or director of the film forgot because of so many flashbacks. What does it want to do? They know they want to show the assassination of the President through the eyes of many, but as the plot expands to such wide extremes it just becomes muddled in its own fecal matter. Eventually the film is no longer about perspective, but about car chases and shootouts. This is where the plot holes come roaring in one after another and the overly done clichés continue. Dennis Quaid gives one of the worst acting performances of this millennium along with the guy from "Lost," who has such a big secret, both he and the writer can't wait to tell you. They hint at it long enough to actually make you wonder if they're stupid enough to go through with it, so you may doubt what they're going to do, because it's set up so poorly. You think they're trying to trick you, but trust your instincts. Expect terrible clichés and you'll know exactly where the film is headed.The dialogue was horrendous. The coincidences were through the roof. The predictability starts in the trailer. I was laughing at it, literally, laughing at its terrible execution. There was no substance to this once so ever. It's like they got to a point were they were done with all the flashbacks and said, "Let's have a 10 minute car chase and a bunch of shootouts." I loved when the guy from "Lost" turns around after he's carrying the President off the stage and looks at Quaid and says "find that shooter!" It's just so laughable. The car chase is terrible. For some inexplicit reason a little girl that Forest Whitaker takes a fond liking to is running through a highway- that for some odd reason isn't closed off during or after such an incredible event. An ambulance truck driven by terrorists are flying down the highway at her as she stands in the middle of the road screaming for about 30 seconds. It was like "Austin Powers" where they make fun of movies where they have morons standing in the road screaming for a long time instead of steeping back off the road and avoiding the oncoming car. As the little girl stands there screaming, coincidentally, the driver is preoccupied and not looking at the road (Yes, that cliché). When he turns around, he sees the girl in the street so he flips the truck instead of killing another innocent life. For some reason he tries to avoid her. This guy is responsible for killing a lot of people, but now he quickly grows a heart. Then Forest does something that is completely shocking. Not!!!! Just another cliché that has been done before. There's just nothing here to get excited about. It starts off good then continually get's worse and worse and by the end you'll find yourself watching some of the worst scenes in film history."The beauty of American arrogance is that they can't imagine a world where they're not a step ahead." Interestingly enough this quote came out of this film and interestingly enough the filmmakers add to that "arrogance" of always being a step a head. Look who lives and look who dies when some of the people who don't look like they're going to live end up living. More Pro-American, Anti-Anyone else clichés."Vantage Point" is one of the most ridiculous films you're ever going to come across. Especially, when you're watching Dennis Quaid turn into Superman as he brushes off bullets, or when he jumps out of a car that was T-Boned into a building with him getting crushed in between the car and an 18 wheeler that weighs about 10 tons. He simply jumps out of the car, unscathed, and brushes off his shoulders. That's not a joke. That's actually what he does. This was more effective as a comedy and what made it so funny was that the filmmakers took it so seriously. This film is a joke. Another stinker for 2008 for Forest Whitaker to add to the heap of crap after his great performance in "The Last King of Scotland," which seems decades ago. Now he looks like a below average actor, which he might be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Story So Preposterous and Campy I Started Laughing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point is a camp delight! By the film's end I was waiting for our shaky-handed, Secret Service hero to rip-off his shirt to expose a big Superman letter "S" on his chest! Terrorists who blithely slaughter innocent people left and right will throw everything out the window over a single child! You know a bomb has just been planted but you keep standing around talking. A bomb goes off right under your nose with loads of people lying dead and wounded but our various heroes barely have a scratch except for their tattered clothes! The Secret Service is totally inept except for one guy with shaky hands! I think you get the picture! But the best scene is one of the last. Its when the President snaps awake at just the right moment, after just being drugged, and kloncks the bad guy over the heads with a piece of metal all because the villains conveniently failed to strap him down properly! But just moments earlier taking out a score of Secret Service agents was a walk in the park!I did find the 'Groundhog Day' technique of repeating the same day over, and over again, but from different perspectives, to be a very interesting approach to story telling. Too bad it was wasted on such a unbelievably ridiculous story! It's as if Hollywood's main concern is satisfying it's teenage market segment over all others. I'm not a teenager and I go to the movies virtually every week! What about the adult segment of your market? Don't we count for anything?This film is trying terribly hard to be a frantic 'French Connection' type movie without worrying much about the story. If all you want is dumbed-down, murder and mayhem, a sort of terrorist war-porn flick, then Vantage Point is for you! But if a decent story is an important ingredient in your recipe for time well spent, then I humbly suggest renting something that has stood the test of time, like the French Connection, instead!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It didn't really look that way from the previews (looked more like a whodunit) but it is. It's like SPEED or THE FUGITIVE in that way and like RUN LOLA RUN in it's structure. So if you like those films I'd say it's a safe bet for you. It also has a really great car chase scene and this is coming from someone who usually doesn't "get" those. During that whole sequence all I could think was 'how did they choreograph that?' because it had to be really precise. I mean the cars were almost dancing.You have a stellar ensemble cast here. Forest Whitaker plays a witness to the events who gets caught up in the whirlwind. I don't think I've even seen him run before so this was a little different for him. Matthew Fox and Dennis Quaid play secret service men. I was surprised how little screen time Fox had and if there is a star it's Dennis. I don't think it appeared that way in the trailer either. But mainly the whole thing was split up between all these different characters and their vantage points on this assassination attempt on the US president in Spain. William Hurt plays the president and I'm thinking I'm going to write him in in November. He just looks the part. Sigourney Weaver plays a TV producer who is a witness as she's producing the live coverage and for a minute I thought we didn't see her vantage point but her's was the first one we watched. We were watching along with her and I didn't realize we were already doing the multiple point of views thing. They all culminate at about the same point and once we've seen all of them the action continues from there into a perfect ending.This film really gets going right away and there is no time for a potty break. There isn't a lot of cursing, just a couple words here or there, and not too scary violence so people who watch "LOST" and "24" level action should be able to handle it. This is the sort of movie you used to only get in the summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got home from seeing an early showing of this film and I just must say, "OH MY GOD...". Within the first 5 minutes easily, I was so engrossed that I couldn't look away. It was very intense. And although some may find the constant 'rewinding' to be annoying, I just found that it made it that much more awesome. Every 20 minutes or so you're right on the edge of your seat and are left hanging until the very end. It's one giant tease, but it's totally worth it. Definitely one of the smartest, and most well executed movies I can remember seeing. The whole ensemble is absolutely flawless. It had the perfect combination of action, suspense, and humor.I just can't say enough good things about this movie. Please, go now.. and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 viewpoints-many loose ends-one truth----stinker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How do we begin?The President is shot, Secret Service agents chase down a "shooter", unconnected characters intersect in increasingly meaningless ways. Oh and did I mention the GROUNDHOG DAY-esqe time rewind? Audible audience laughter is not what you expect to hear in a thriller. When a film with such a reasonable premise is butchered and ultimately ends up dying an ignoble death, my first question was where was the strong hand of the director? Or the screenwriter? This film stinks of heavy handed hacking after test audience screening. It must hurt to lose control of your film.I was teased by what appears on paper to be a stellar cast-William Hurt, Dennis Quaid, Sigourney Weaver, Forest Whitaker, Hollywood's favourite LOST boy-Matthew Fox. I can only hint at the angry disappointment I felt after the credits rolled. All of these actors have performed admirably in similar roles--here they are groundless, and the prestige they could have brought to the film is squandered.Sigourney Weaver brings some pathos, only to be cast aside when her story plot is terminated. Dennis Quaid tries his best as the Secret Service agent trying to quell his demons, but he's not Clint Eastwood, and this is not IN THE LINE OF FIRE. William Hurt can be Presidential in his sleep, give him some depth please. Matthew Fox has no reason speaking bad Spanish when his co-pilot is speaking perfect English, Forest Whitaker does his best mumbly, stumbly, heavy faced bit, but his part in the story is simply meaningless, I'm happy he gets to reconcile with his wife and son, but please people, The President has been shot, blown up, kidnapped, drugged and tossed around an ambulance in a multi-car pile up....so is it ESSENTIAL to waste a final shot on Forest talking on a cell phone to his unseen son??...Someone must have some minutes to use up.Ultimately VANTAGE POINT is half the film it could have been, it lacks sufficient character motivation or back story, the characters are caricatures, the script is diluted to the point of meaningless and while it sports a great climatic car chase, the final scene is as implausible as they come-----a highly trained band of ruthless conspirators, toting the latest in high tech gadgetry, killing co-conspirators as they see fit, assisted by an inside man, successfully pull off TWO intricate operations and on the road to getting away scot-free, only to be undone because an irrelevant character JAYWALKS!Come on, we are smarter than that and as film makers you should be smart enough to know that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting concept, poor execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just came back home from seeing this movie and I wanted to share my thoughts right away because this movie was disappointing. While the concept is interesting, the execution was very poor.I will start my review with the good points. The first good point about this movie is the suspense. I must admit that I got hooked right away by the story. You see the president of the United States being shot but nothing is what it seems. The rest of the movie gives you the answers bits by bits. The second good point about this movie is the acting. Almost every character in the movie is believable and the performances are quite solid. Two thumbs up for Dennis Quaid in his role of veteran secret service agent Barnes and to Forest Whitaker who impresses me with every single performance he gives. Not only does he plays convincingly, he impersonates every character he plays (Last King of Scotland anyone?). However, Taghmaoui and Zurer are the weakest link in the bunch. That's it for the good points. As for the weaknesses of this movie, they are many.I will start with the factual errors that plagued the whole movie from start to finish. The movie tells us events that happened during an international counter-terrorism summit. However, the host country is not represented by the Spanish prime minister or any other high ranking Spanish politician. The country is represented by the mayor of Salamanca who offers his city to the world. OUCH!!! Actually an International summit is organized on a state level and only the President (Or prime minister or Chancellor etc) of the host country is responsible of the city and the facilities that will be used for the event, not the mayor. This is an international summit for God's sake not a municipal trivial event. Secondly, in such summits, the general public is not allowed in the premises of the event as depicted in the movie. That is no way to have such a large crowd present during an announcement of such importance. The only people who could have been present would have been high ranking officials, head of states and important leaders, not average Joes. Furthermore, the protesters wouldn't have been allowed to be that close to the premises of the event. There's always a security perimeter that the general public can never cross and it's usually quite large.The second main weakness of the movie is how its subject matter is treated. I assume that the main subject of the movie was terrorism. However, the story doesn't give us any objective treatment, actually it's biased. Terrorism is again pinned on Arabs, as the summit unites Arab states and the West. There is no explanation as what western countries were present, it just states the West. There are no subtleties. There is no mention of what leads to terrorism or the way to confront this dangerous phenomenon. Therefore, terrorists in this movie are depicted as your usual stereotypical bad guy. There's not even a remote attempt to explain their background or the reasons that push them to do what they do or to believe in what they believe. They are just terrorists who want to hurt civilized countries. Later in the movie you'll learn that the attempt on the presidential life was a vendetta by the terrorists because they failed to smuggle a dirty bomb out of Morocco. Wow! How credible is that! Suffice to say that it's more likely for a dirty bomb to be smuggled out of Pakistan or Central Asia not out of Morocco. The third main weakness of the movie is its character development. It's actually non existent in this movie except for Thomas Barnes, Howard Lewis and Javier. There is no development for the other characters in the movie. Who are they really? What motivates them to do what they do? The terrorist bare Spanish names but are they truly Spanish? What led to the betrayal of Kent Taylor (Mathew Fox's character)? Was it ideological? Does he hold a grudge against his government? We don't know and the movie makes no effort to give us a clue. The last weakness that I will list here is the narrative style used to tell the story. We were supposed to see the story from the perspective of eight different people. However, this choice is ambiguous and not well executed. For the first two thirds of the movie you can really see the story from different perspectives. While this may be interesting at first, the constant rewinding sequences become boring and redundant by the third time. Many people left the auditorium after the third time and I couldn't help but close my eyes to avoid watching the rewinding sequences again. When the movie reached the final third, it was apparent to me that the director didn't know what he was doing anymore. The perspective story telling is totally abandoned and we are actually led to see the perspective of three different characters at the same time. This choice makes the first 60 minutes of the movie totally irrelevant. Why did the director choose to start with a specific narrative style and then abandon it for the final 30 minutes? Why didn't he stick with a conventional story telling style from the start? Did he want to make a Rashomon style movie? Was he trying to use a Pulp Fiction type of storytelling? If that was his intention, then he totally failed to accomplish his goals.All in all, I give this movie a 4 stars out of 10. It remains a suspenseful and thrilling movie but its flaws outweigh its strong points. My advice: Watch it once, forget it and don't expect to see or learn anything new from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American arrogance?Vantage Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the correlation between the Arab's comment of American arrogance making us think we are always one step ahead of the world and the fact that this film falls into the same exact trap. I understand the concept of multiple viewpoints on the proceedings, as well as the rewinding to show us those differences, however, if you are going to do it, only show us what we missed the first time. Not to spoil anything, the sequence of a character throwing a bomb underneath the presidential podium is shown four times as it is seen by four people?are you kidding? We know the person did it the first time, gloss over it and get to what we DON'T know. A gimmick can work if it is utilized to full effect. However, I can't really complain about that because the entire concept of the film is false advertising. Eight views, one truth? Not really. More like eight people with plot progression story lines that add up to the one truth. These people aren't seeing different things and coming up with different conclusions, they are only giving us the full picture rather than incomplete snippets. The tricks involved are great, in theory, but it seems that the filmmakers needed a lot of padding for the short script and decided hiding information and/or cutting away when the truth is apparent in order to show it later would be a more fun way to tell the tale.My real problem is the fact that we as an audience are played with at every moment. We are teased with answers and made to sit through a new character's account that holds 75% old information with only 25% new before we are actually given what we should have received twenty minutes ago. Where is the cream filling? Vantage Point ends up being all flash with no center to hold it together. It is a real shame because the plot and conspiracy going on are well thought out and planned. Maybe if it was a straightforward short film it would have been great, but as a feature, recycling footage and manipulating what's on screen in order to extend the runtime, it just plain fails. Also, the ending is real corny, clichéd, and obvious.I wonder how much of its trouble comes from a very extended cutting period. I saw the first trailer for this film in June 07 and it only came out yesterday at the end of February 08. Something is fishy there. Maybe they cut all the backstory, because honestly, there is absolutely none on display. We are never told why all this is happening; why people's allegiances have been changed; why a hero secret service man is "punishing himself" for what he did, (considering we only know he took a bullet for the President, we have to assume he did something after to make it appear that he might step out of the line of fire the second time); or why the orchestrator of it all is seemingly working on his own. The movie shows us just enough to get by and then throws a new twist so that we forget we haven't really been told anything. I guess the fact that America and Arab nations are at war and trying to come to a peace accord is enough background for us to believe this would all happen so quickly without any other nation's support.I can't disregard the work completely, though, because this cast is amazing. How they got everyone involved, I have no idea. Dennis Quaid does his usual stern face of contemplation, but he plays a secret service agent always on the job, so it is acceptable. Matthew Fox is a lot of fun especially later on when he lets loose a bit and has some fun. Forest Whitaker is probably the best thing the movie has going for it and shows that he can elevate any role given to him. He is pitch perfect with every emotion he is made to elicit after the tragedies that unfold in front of him. There are so many other people that it would be tough to get to them all, but mention for Edgar Ramirez and Sa?d Taghmaoui (both desperately underused in Hollywood) and new face Eduardo Noriega needs to be made.In the end, Vantage Point becomes a by the numbers blockbuster that takes its possibly intelligent plot and dumbs it down completely in order to be served up to the lowest common denominator of the American public. Arrogance becomes the word of the moment as Hollywood has become so much so that they decide they know what's best for the country, churning out mindless action, brainwashing society into feeling that any movie that asks for thought is just boring. With a smaller budget, a more unique vision behind the camera, and the guts to let some carnage and desperation be shown, this might have been great. Instead we are shown a story that flips the supposed winner and loser roles. Where the terrorists think of American arrogance, it ends up being their own egos that ruins them. They think they have beaten democracy with their guard down, but in actuality they just turned a blind eye to the fact that one man could single-handedly have the fortitude to take down an entire cell by himself while his fellow agents think he is crazy, and a little friendly coincidence that every person he runs into has video footage of the exact moments necessary to put the puzzle together. Man those terrorists can be so stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very engaging action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the movie. Dennis Quaid and Forrest Whittaker carried the movie and made it an enjoyable experience. For anyone that is easily made motion sick, the camera work is very shaky during the chase scene and had it lasted much longer would have detracted from the overall experience for me personally. The way the story was told was different but kept me engaged right to the end. I would recommend seeing this film if you get the chance.There is a little something for everyone here. Action, drama, a couple of jokes, and some nice views. There are some actors in this movie that may not be well known, but overall I think everyone in it did an adequate job. If you are a fan of Dennis Quaid you should really like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this film was excellent! I heard some people complaining and saw some of the complaints here on IMDb, but this film is genius. Of course it shows the same scene over and over- that is the entire premise of the movie! So for people to say that it bothered them...well, they must like more uninformative plots, i.e. Jumper.The film starts off with a stickler of a news producer shouting off orders to camera men as the President enters for a speech at a world meeting in Spain. The President, obviously, is shot, but it was the loud and unexpected BOOM that caused me to jump. From there the story rewinds to 23 minutes earlier at 12:00. It replays from all the different vantage points several times. Seeing it over and over is not annoying, though, again, those who might prefer a less engaging story might think it is. Each time the scene rewinds we learn something new about the conference, the people attending, and where the "gunmen" are located. Each scene leaves you on the edge of your seat exhaling slowly as you wait for your adrenaline to slow. The ending is also so explosive and heart-pounding, I held my husband's hand with the "grip of death" in anticipation. This film is definitely worth the overpriced ticket at the box office. It deserves to be seen on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yup Quaid has done it again! I really should start looking out for this guy, as well as Fox. Everything they play in recently, is getting to ridiculous for words! This movie starts out interesting and complex..the way a good action movie should be. And then... Shattered pieces of non-logic bullsh!t come together. A guy who kills a whole team of Secret Service and kidnaps the president, only because he's brother is held hostage? A car chase where our hero (Quaid of course) has a "bump" from a car in his sides, does some spinning (of course, he's driving over 100km/h) and continues the chase like nothing happened? Later on he gets the full load and YET manages to only have some scratches? He's able to keep track with his stupid little car-he-just-took with a police vehicle? (both Opel, sure...pure coincidence, they bring up the cars very well, gonna buy one right away!), the non-fearing terrorists avoid a little girl (scene is perfectly described by another commenter, Leumas L Jackson) while just killed over a few 100 people and having the president in the back of their ambulance? Whiteaker (playing the best he can to save this movie from being totally ridiculous) able to keep up with trained special forces and bodyguards when chasing the bad guy (apparently all muscle in his belly). Quaid is a superhero, taking so much bullets, hits from cars and of course, bringing Otis in is one of the most corny scenes of the film, everybody coming back at the same place (even the mom for Christ sake!) at the right time... (Spain/Mexico is very small people, i've seen it all by now ^^) I DID like 2 things in the movie: the president being a little wiser then normal by saying they won't bomb the terrorist camp, in fear of messing up the conference, and the role of the PDA, making this story nicely complex. They could have brought us a much more eatable dish!! Dammit, when will i ever learn that Hollywood has NO brain when it comes to movies like this. Screw you guys, I'm going home!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disadvantage Pretentious Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Vantage Point' is pretty much another corny clichéd thriller. For a while it was a trend in Hollywood movies to portray the Japanese as the bad guys. This was followed by Russians and now I suppose it's the Muslim Arabs turns to be the heartless 'bad guys' in overly patriotic American films. Riddened with clichés, overdone shaky camera which is supposed to be effective, over-the-top high tech, excessive overblown stunts, heavily intrusive suspense music and one ridiculous twist after the other is what forms 'Vantage Point'. The reason why I was excited about this film was because I had seen, what looked like appealing clips and an interesting cast. However, none of the actors get enough scope to perform. Their roles are clichéd to say the least and unidimensional. The cast includes: that includes Sigourney Weaver (the only one who does not annoy), Forest Whitaker (dude, you just won an Oscar and this is what you come up with next?), Matthew Fox (if you're gonna be picky about movies at least pick something worthwhile), Dennis Quaid (how many times do we have to see a way-passed-middle-aged man play the action hero who saves the world?), Said Taghmaoui (just look how impartial the filmmakers are that they cast an Arab to play a terrorist leader!), Eduardo Noriega (as the Spanish police who had no clue before it was too late), Ayelet Zurer (a hot she-terrorist who's obviously there for eye-candy), Zoe Saldana (the annoying reporter for whom we're supposed to feel sorry because of her untimely death)Edgar Ramirez (the typical innocent-guy-who's-forced-by-circumstances or else terrorists will kill his brother) and William Hurt (the American president who can do no wrong). Not surprising, the American president is this saintly man who just wants to do what's right and has everyone's best interest at heart and the terrorists are ruthless killers with no feelings but of course, as mentioned before, there's a female among them and the director has to stick to his usual clichés, so this she-terrorist looks hot and since she's a woman, she has to have some empathy which is shown when she hesitates to kill the hostage. Lucky for her, her male partner does the job. Oh and there's more: Yes, the non-Americans are shown as people who think Americans are arrogant...oh so much ridicule there is. This isn't the end. There are too many more to merely list in this comment. The thing is, I don't mind watching a fun action flick as long as it doesn't pretend to be something else and insult the viewers intelligence like this piece of crap did.</fullReview>

The acting is not very convincing and it seems more like a quick pay check for some b grade celebs. The whole 8 stories one truth, worked out to be more like 2 episodes of 24, than different point of views, there is no background story or exploration of why all this is happening. It seems its just generally accepted that dark hued men wants to blow up Americans. So if you look away from all this and just want a quick bang for your buck then this movie is still not it. You get to see the same 10 minutes 5 times its really just one big failure of a movie</fullReview>

How many times can you crash a car and continue driving without a scratch on the car? I think it was about 6 before there was any damage on a car. And HOW MANY TIMES can you watch the story reset to 23 minutes previously? There wasn't really a point to this movie except to vilify the US and then terrorists and... there was no motivation for any of it. Point is, it sucked. A lot. Don't pay money for it.

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this film, what with its impressive cast and multiple view point idea... sounds great! Boy was I surprised! OK the action is great and the film looks good but the story is ridiculously unbelievable. I'm sure the American audiences will be a whooping and a hollering in the cinema. I didn't whoop or holler, more like laugh and cringe at the cliché ridden script. Yes the story is diabolical but its better than the acting! Forest Whitaker wont be collecting his second Oscar for this! As for the rest of the cast (except Sigourney Weaver who was OK) they seemed to have "lost" there acting abilities or more likely too busy thinking about how to spend the huge pay packet they got for this dross. The worst one was Dennis Quaid, the hero! A lump of mahogany would have given of more charisma. His character was dull and boring and I didn't care if he saved the president. actually I was hoping that he'd fail, but hey that was never going to happen. This is the worst film I have seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just plain bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point really didn't have any redeeming qualities. It really failed on all fronts, none of the technical aspects were especially good (but, to be fair, not especially bad either), and the story was so mottled it just got annoying. The concept was kind of interesting, and I guess executed well but without a solid plot to begin with it doesn't really matter. The acting was alright, it wasn't terrible but wasn't anything Oscar worthy either. The thing that got me with this movie was how the plot dragged on...and on...and on. For a thriller that is supposed to be action packed and only an hour and twenty minutes long, I was actually dumbfounded at how bored I was only half an hour in, and how painful the idea of another hour of this nonsense was to me. The plot is pretty basic, the President is shot and people have to find out who shot him and why. If you've seen any movie like this before (and don't let the concept of the film throw you, it is just another political thriller like the Bourne movies) you can pretty much figure out what's going to happen before it does or won't be surprised at anything that happens. The problem with the 8 viewpoints concept is that instead of adding to the scope of the film, it really limits it. You see the same events happen 8 times, and by the third time I was sick of it. The fact that the film conveniently decides to start over right before a plot twist is revealed just tells me that it didn't have much of a plot to begin with, along with the fact that a rather large twist regarding the president is revealed IN EVERY SINGLE TRAILER FOR THE FILM. This movie is garbage, I would have been happy with a basic thriller with a concept and it couldn't even manage to deliver that. If you want to see a good film with this concept, see Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon, not this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's The Point??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point starts off with the incident that you see in all the trailers. An incident is all the story real amounts to. We watch the first POV from that of the news crew -- however, it is real not a point of view of any specific person, we just follow the action of certain people -- when the story reaches a certain point we quickly rewind to the next POV (kinda) from the same time (which time-code on the screen becomes part of the films laughable points) the first began.In all, we watch a very repetitive story, and not much of an actual story at that. No character study, depth or explanation of why any characters do what they do (only a slight history on ONE character). While you do not need and in depth character study for all films, usually there is someone you emphasize with.As I watch the film, the fourth time the story rewound, the scoffs in the theater had become out-loud laughs, and not the good kind, the kind that tells you the rest of the audience agrees with your own thought of how stupid the film really is.In the end, there is no real story and surprisingly mediocre performances from actors who usually perform rather well. This usually indicates an unskilled director. When most actors in a film look bad, including those usually good, it is the director! Other than an attempt at a film exercise of some sort, when the film was over I could only ask, "What's the point of Vantage Point?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to give this 1 star, I wanted to like it, but it failed on so many counts to be either impressive or clever it's all it deserves.The story line could have actually said something, 24 hour media, terrorist threats, international cooperation, a US president doing something International - not unilateral. But it seemed to start an idea and then give up on it.I enjoyed the back flipping of time, but the continuity was terrible and the plot holes were too big to be forgiven. I'll allow a certain amount of coincidence in a film. But to accept all that this film asks is too much.Even the car chase, which was exciting and well shot, was horribly let down by the lack of continuity (damage and car badges, signs, models) If you don't want a European audience that's fine - but at least try to hide that it's mostly shot in Mexico. Do we shoot in Australia and claim it's the US? Finally. If i did forgive all of the above, and accept it as an action film with a few faults. The dialogue would still have been rock bottom. I've never heard the sound of a cinema audience's collective eyes rolling before.I know i should have read reviews first. But I'm trying to make up for it by writing this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Vantage Point first came out in the movies, I was intrigued enough to want and go see it, but never got around to it. And thank God for that! Still curious, I did although rent it the other day with a fair amount of expectation which was horribly let down well and truly before the movie was even over. It starts off with promise, but by the second or third POV you can tell how tiring and unsatisfying the rest of the film is going to be.First up, this movie is a perfect example that a line up of renowned stars doesn't make a great movie, with not one of the many actors making any real impact. All of them seemed far too unrealistic and emotionless as characters in the scenario they were in. Then there's the plot structure, which is just plain messy. At one point, I couldn't even remember who's POV we were in as it seemed it had blended with everyone else's. I don't think there is even 8 POV's like the tagline says! The script is eternally bland and the story is a poor man's attempt at "Crash", treating its audience like idiots. One man being able to take on a league of terrorists? An old President able to break free from his captives? And then there's the cream of the crop. After having killed thousands of innocent civilians and doing anything to achieve their goal, the terrorists are stopped by a girl wandering across the road. I mean, come on! Who do you take us for? Do you not give us any credit? Look, I know what Levy was trying to do and I give him credit for it. He wanted to make something different and he took a shot at it, and good on him for going out there and doing it. Unfortunately, there is just too much wrong with this movie to applaud it for a lot other than a nice car chase.

		<shortDescription>Thrilling and exciting picture set the city of Salamanca , Spain , where in a public square takes place extraordinary events .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>US President Henry Ashton (William Hurt) is in Salamanca, Spain , accompanied by his security agents (Matthew Fox and Dennis Quaid as agent newly returned from previous wounds) , for a world summit where an international treaty dealing with the fight against global terrorism will be signed and which was highly promoted by the USA . Then an unknown sniper is able to shoot him and a bomb goes off in the square and it causes panic , destruction , mass confusion and hysteria . Meanwhile , TV Executive Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver whose role was originally written as a male but filmmaker changed it to a woman because he felt the movie lacked a strong female character) is shooting the surprising deeds . The attempted assassination of the American President is told and re-told from several different perspectives , as from a tourist (in the original screenplay, the tourist was a Russian , as when Forest Whitaker auditioned for a different role, filmmaker was so impressed that he rewrote as an American tourist) or a Spanish police (Eduardo Noriega) o terrorists (Edgar Ramirez ,Sa?d Taghmaoui , Ayelet Zurer) and fourth is the president himself . At the end new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which definitively completes the flick of what really took place during the incident and who was involved in the conspiracy.Stirring as well as exciting film packs noisy action , thrills , suspense , explosions , violence , twits and turns . Thrilling film with a peculiar edition narrated under several sight points , as various minutes are retold, emphasizing different characters' actions and gradually, we discover who's behind the script . The studio originally wanted to shoot the entire film in Salamanca, Spain, but the local government refused to close the Plaza Mayor for nearly 3 months and only the scenes filmed from the air were shot in Spain , as production was moved to Cuernavaca and Puebla, Mexico . Nevertheless , Matthew Fox, Eduardo Noriega, Forest Whitaker and director Pete Travis attended the premiere, held in Salamanca, Spain, on February 12, 2008 and City Hall declared them "Distinguished Guests". The original script set the story in Madrid, but the producers wanted a more "exotic" location. The fact is revealed in some scenes, like the secret service guy who says they can't locate a single person among "5 or 6 million" (Madrid's population; Salamanca's is much smaller), or when the cop enters a Muslim neighborhood during the foot chase , as Madrid has one, but Salamanca doesn't . Very good production design by Brigitte Boch , when shooting was moved to Mexico, the production design team built a replica of Salamanca's Plaza Mayor, which is slightly smaller than the original . There happens an impressive explosion on the Plaza , it was filmed by fifteen different cameras under direction of excellent photographer Amir Mokri who makes a colorful and evocative cinematography . Moving and adequate Original Music by Atli Örvarsson . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Pete Travis . He is a director and writer, known for Dredd (2012) , Omagh (2004) , End game (2008) , TV Henry VIII (2003) and Falcón (TV Series) 2012 , set in Sevilla , Spain . The precocious technical mastery displayed by Peter Travis in ¨Vantage Point¨ is magnificent and he delivers narrative fluidity , being helped by a splendid editor , Stuart Baird , both of whom carry out a complex story paced from multiple viewpoints . Rating : 7 . Interesting action film and it will appeal to thriller fans .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad for a Mid Week Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rather enjoyed Vantage Point. Obviously it's not a 'great' movie, in the deeply meaningful, Oscar worthy, life enhancing sense. But it's pretty well made, modestly exciting, slickly edited and it brightened up what was threatening to be a dull, mid week evening in a way that didn't tax my poor brain too much. A Friday Night Movie. Even though I cheated by watching it on a Wednesday.The plot revolves around an assassination attempt on the US President played by William Hurt (looking uncannily like Gerald Ford) at an anti terrorism conference in Salamanca Spain. Why Salamanca I couldn't guess, as it looks like a place so impossible to guard effectively that it would be the last place on earth to host 150 assorted world leaders. But Salamanca it is ? or it's supposed to be. I have read that most of it was actually filmed in Mexico ? and the movie presents the attack from 5 different view points, played out over a time period of 23 minutes. Dennis Quaid is a twitchy Secret Service agent, Thomas Barnes, recently recovered from taking a bullet for the president six months previously. Will he hold up to the stress? Can he still be relied on? Let's just say there are few surprises.After the presidential shooting, there are two bombs, apparently to finish off the job completely, a ridiculous but nonetheless very enjoyable car chase through the streets of what purports to be Salamanca and many shots of Dennis Quaid grittily but attractively knitting his brow as he tries to work out who are the goodies and who are the baddies. Considering the way the man survives apparently unscathed after the bombing, shooting, a marathon sprint along the streets, a gut wrenching car chase and finally a wreck involving a truck, I can only assume he's auditioning to be the new Superman! All totally unreal of course, yet fun.The cast are all good; Forest Whitaker plays Howard Lewis, an American tourist whose camcorder provides vital evidence, Matthew Fox is an agent who is definitely more Secret than Special, as he may not be all he seems, Eduardo Noriega ? looking tastefully soulful - plays a local policeman who is being cheated on by his girlfriend and is mistaken for an assassin, Edgar Ramirez is Javier, who has been blackmailed into helping the terrorists, and Sigourney Weaver is very good as a TV Co-ordinator (Producer? Director? I'm not sure what the correct term is, but basically she's in charge of the outside broadcast unit.) Unfortunately we barely see her after the early scenes, but it is at least good to see a middle aged woman in a serious role which doesn't involve her being someone's wife or mother.There are a few twists and turns as the plot unfolds. All is not as straightforward as it seems, and as we watch the event from different perspectives, we see how the characters link together. Personally I thought the story telling style worked perfectly well. A good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A high octane &amp; riveting thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage point basically means that a place from which one has a good view of something which this film portrays so well. It was an absolute amazing, brilliant &amp; fantastic thriller that keeps you interested, excited &amp; entertained right from start to end. The movie had a simple story about the president of America getting shot twice and their is an explosion afterwards, the story was repeated several times in other people's point of view all happening at the same time known as vantage point.The screenplay was terrific that had so many different events &amp; situations which makes it impossible for the audience to get bored. As soon as the movie started it got to the point instead of having a boring build up. It was about an hour and a half and I enjoyed every second of it and the whole film was so fast paced that it felt like a 30 minutes TV episode.Vantage Point reminded me of a German film which I really liked called Run Lola Run which had one story told in three different perspectives. One of The Simpson's episodes called "Trilogy of Error" of season 12 is really similar to Vantage Point which had three different stories all happening at the same time in different point of views.Overall thriller is my favourite genre and this is the kind of thrillers I want, so I would to thank the filmmakers for this superb movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I doubt anyone will fall asleep watching this film. That's the best feature of this movie: it's very entertaining and once you start it, it's tough to put down. Being only 90 minutes, it's a quick hour-and-a-half. It also helps to know that you are going to get the story told from a handful of angles, so expect to see similar scenes running over and over, each with a few new wrinkles added. Also, expect a lot of the action scenes that are both fun to view but not very credible. My favorite - spoiler alert! - of that is when "Thomas Barne's" (Dennis Quaid) little blue car is totally bashed in by a huge 18-wheeler. Not only that, the car is smashed up against a brick wall. It should look like a metal pancake. Seconds later, Quaid emerges from the wreck and is running down the street like a football halfback shooting his pistol! He hardly has a scratch on him, and the limp disappears after about three strides!Credibility-aside, along with a few cheap shots with placards early on by a crowd which protesting the U.S. at an anti-terrorist summit (they prefer terrorists, I guess!) and the usual politically-correct characters, it's a fun ride not to be taken seriously but as a short entertainment diversion.The twists are fun to see, too, as the same-but-similar story slowly unwinds and all the pieces finally fall into place by the end.....even though, how they do manage that is by stretching things a bit!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst insult to American film-making ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was by far the worst movie of the year. It was repetitive and annoying. I felt like I was tricked into seeing it because the previews I saw made it seem like this movie was actually going to break the silence about what's going on in American politics, but all it did was show the same worthless scene over and over and over again. With movies like this, I can't help but think it's just another way of dumbing down society, the movie was that stupid. If you like everything being broken down for you, mediocre acting and a terrible ending and you aren't self aware you will love this movie. If you actually like to use your brain you will be as insulted as I was by how little depth the movie actually provided, and you'll probably feel like a Bush loving redneck when you leave the theater. I want my money back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The adrenalin-laced, political conspiracy thriller "Vantage Point" depicts the shooting of an American president from eight standpoints. For the sake of simplicity, half as many perspectives would have been plenty, especially since few of the characters in this tense, white-knuckled nonsense are even remotely fascinating. The audience that I sat with chuckled each time director Pete Travis literally rewound the action that occurred in the opening 10 minutes to show the president taking two bullets in the chest before a terrific explosion obliterates the stage and sends everybody scrambling and screaming. Once this set-piece has been replayed ad nauseam during the first hour, "Vantage Point" regains its momentum during its remaining half-hour with an improbable but hair-raising car chase through narrow streets in an obvious homage to "The Bourne Identity." U.S. President Ashton (William Hurt of "The Big Chill") arrives in Salamanca, Spain, where he is to headline a landmark summit on counter-terrorism. A packed crowd of spectators greet him enthusiastically while Secret Service agents ogle everybody as a possible assassin. One of the President's bodyguards, Agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid of "Wyatt Earp"), is back on the job after taking a bullet for Ashton a year ago. Barnes' colleagues, Agents Taylor (Matthew Fox of "Smoking Aces") and Holden (Richard T. Jones of TV's "Judging Amy") think that Barnes has lost his nerve. Remember the Clint Eastwood character in the superior thriller "In the Line of Fire" (1993) and you'll have a clue about Quaid's queasy character. Meanwhile, a crew for the Global Network News has about as many roving cameramen in the crowd as security officials, and producer Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver of "Alien") coordinates their efforts as well as her correspondent on the scene, Angie Jones (Zoe Saldana of "Guess Who"), as the presidential motorcade wheels into the plaza. No sooner has President Ashton reached the podium than gunshots erupt and he crumples backwards wounded on the stage."Vantage Point" suffers from several problems. Some characters come and go, while you wish some would just leave. For example, the Sigourney Weaver character hangs around just long enough to establish the Spanish setting and provide background about Dennis Quaid's troubled character and then she vanishes. On the other hand, Academy Award winner Forest Whitaker loiters on the sidelines as the least interesting character. He's walked out on his wife and kids and doesn't know what to do except attend the summit. However, he does show up again to rescue an innocent bystander in the last quarter hour. Talk about a great actor being wasted in a thankless role. The people that play the terrorists are cast according to stereotype. They are swarthy, dark-haired, suspicious-looking types that we never learn anything about, so the conspiracy part of this thriller is never sufficiently laid out. One of the terrorists has been coerced into participating because his brother is being held hostage by his colleagues, but too much information is missing from Barry Levy's screenplay so you cannot sympathize with either brother. The incomparable William Hurt looks sorely miscast as the president, too. It's doubtful that any politician with as little hair as Hurt has could charm voters into putting him in the White House. Worst, between the assassination attempt and the car chase, "Vantage Point" spends so much time rewinding the same action that the surprising are more annoying than interesting.Freshman director Pete Travis borrows an idea first done by acclaimed Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa in his 1954 art-house hit "Rashomon." In that classic, four people tell different versions of the same story from their perspectives. The Kurosawa classic was remade in 1964 as a Paul Newman western called "The Outrage," but the movie that most filmgoers will compare "Vantage Point" with is the 1993 Bill Murray comedy "Groundhog Day." Unfortunately, these shuffling perspectives grow tiresome despite the additions that they furnish to plot. The last half-hour of "Vantage Point" provides some welcome relief with a slam-bang car chase that defies believability. Indeed, the Secret Service may see its applicant pool rise as a result of the indestructible nature of the Dennis Quaid hero who survives everything thrown at him.The first-rate ensemble cast gives the hackneyed "Vantage Point" everything that they can muster, especially Quaid as a veteran Secret Service agent haunted by memories of a previous assassination attempt when he shielded Ashton. When everything is said and done, this high-octane, nail-biter depends on a tedious flashback gimmick to pump up its formulaic thrills and contrived chills in an incredibly convoluted plot that ultimately confuses more than it compels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At least it felt like it considering how many times the audience laughed. The biggest laughs seem to come each time the screen goes black and the beginning time starts ticking again.The biggest problem was not the actors. It was the script. The horrible dialog began with the Sigourney Weaver and ended with Dennis Quad at the end.The car chases and running were only bearable to laugh at all the funny faces Dennis Quaid makes as the camera zooms into his face to get is reaction to almost hitting something.The premise of the movie is entirely blown when the last "replay" basically tells you everything that happened. The replays aren't clues....as it's suggested in the trailer, they are merely cliffhangers to set up the last scene that shows you how all the previous replays ended. The only thing the last part did was fill in the cliffhangers that the other replays left you with. Whats going to happen with the little girl? What did Dennis Quaid see? Why didn't they just show us at those moments and spare us the replays? If you want a better movie that used this gimmick to much better effect, try "12:14" and stay away from this stinker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film made me feel sick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a film student and can usually find at least one aspect of a film that I've been prepared to pay for but on this occasion I felt like I had just wasted my money. Don't get me wrong, the first 50 or so minutes are quite entertaining; the flashbacks are an interesting and well explored way to cover the story from different angles, slowly revealing new pieces of information and, because it is a mainstream film, you don't mind that you have already predicted most of it. However, once the direction Peter Travis's film becomes more clear I began to feel quite uneasy watching it. The blatant pro-American script is to be expected (right down to Forrest Whittaker's character, Howard, being the civilian to save the little girl despite him being the only American in a sea of Spaniards who are clearly incapable) but the massively uneducated 'insight' into terrorism was nauseating. All foreigners (non-Americans) with speaking roles were terrorists except for the girl, her mother and Enrique (the cop played by Noriega)and he was a suspect for most of the film who had had a connection to one of the terrorists. And because their appearance is slightly different, with their Mediterranean skin tone, the mainstream audience already felt distanced from them they were allowed to speak English, so as not to make it to difficult for the incredibly stupid people this film is clearly aimed at. However when we discover that Taylor is a terrorist he begins to speak Spanish so as not to confuse the audience, helping us to understand he's one of the 'bad men'. The fact that Barnes has more lives than a cat doesn't offend me, it just decreases the credibility of the film further still, and the embrace between himself and the President at the very end of the film was clearly not well thought through as it looked more like a scene edited out of Brokeback Mountain and was met by an audible snigger by the audience. In summary the American's are all too squeaky clean, the terrorists are just one step behind every time, because America can't be beat and it just smacks of pro-Bush, pro-war propaganda. It took great effort on my part not to violently vomit on the seat in front of me as the resolution came to a head. I think I actually hate this film.</fullReview>

I think I've lost more brain cells sitting through that nonsense than Robert Downey Jr on his hardest night of partying! I'll give it a one, because I can't give it a zero. For that 1, I will give it credit that Matthew Fox is in it and he is HOT! Yep, that's how bad this movie is that the only credit I can give it is for the sexy star. OK, basically all of the characters are glorified extras. The writing was an insult to my intelligence. The plot, I didn't care about any of the characters, I wanted them all dead, including the little girl. Do I sound bitter? Well I am, and you will be too. What a waste of a talent such as Forest Whitaker to play the tourist with the video camera. Sigourney Weaver, another glorified extra. Matthew Fox who is amazing on Lost, again, well you get the drill. Forest Whitaker was there basically to showcase the Sony video camera. Also the cell phones, wow, how has Bush not been assassinated when so many of us have access to Palm Pilots? I was angry at this movie. I was wearing a hat and covered my eyes turned to the side and went to sleep after about the 3rd rewind. It was either that or get arrested for murder of my best friend for not letting us walk out. Also the camera work and rewinding made me dizzier than Cloverfield. After the second rewind the entire audience was complaining, which just kept getting louder as they kept happening. This is what Variety has to say about it and I couldn't agree more, "? a 23-minute movie dragged out, via some narrative gimmickry, to a punishing hour and a half." Cloverfield seems like Oscar material next to this film. The Bourne Film's seem like Shakespeare. Watch at your own risk of coming out dumber...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a waste of great acting talent. I just watched it on TV and how glad I am I watched it on cable and didn't have to pay to see this movie. So what do you get? Action? Yes. Car chases: definitely. Original filming: I can appreciate the attempt. Good acting: Always Love Forest Whitaker. 4 points. What was missing? Credibility: 2 bombs passing security, cars hitting walls without airbags opening up, infiltration, people dying on one bullet while other ones keep going and a President that is kidnapped and not assassinated for whatever reason. President is saved, everybody happy. If you have seen Man on Fire then you know why this is such a bad movie. There have been films review-slaughtered who where much and much better then this one. So if you want a brainless action movie, go ahead - but there are much better movies in this category. If you want nothing but pure car chases: go rent the Fast and the Furious. Nice try.

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie for what it was. I'm not really sure what other people were expecting to give it what I believe to be unfair and too harsh critiques, but this is a good movie. It is not perfect, nor is it great, nor did it show me something I have never seen before, but it is a nice little crime thriller done in a unique manner.I have read that a lot of people felt that it was boring to see the same story played out over and over. But wasn't that the point of this film? We knew that was going to be the case coming into this movie. And the thing of it is is that there is enough different in each perspective where it is not a bore to see the same instance multiple times. I liked how it was up to the viewer to try to piece things together and figure out exactly what happened and who the culprit really is. This is a good movie if you are not looking for anything great or mind blowing. I do enjoy when I see a great, mind blowing film, but I'm not expecting it every time that I sit down to watch a movie. I do not see any reason to dislike this movie. It's good for what it is and if you're in the market for an entertaining, "who dunnit?" crime thriller I say "Vantage Point" makes for a fun watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One question.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point is a very cool and interesting film. But it leaves me with one question and one question only... who were the people. By that I mean who were the people trying to assassinate the president? I know there were a few people in the group but why would they try to assassinate the president really? Was it for fun? Vantage point is about the president's assassination. But through seven points of view. For instance, agent Barnes(Dennis Quaid)is the president's(Willam Hurt) bodyguard. Sigourney Weaver and two other people in a newsvan witness it also. Forest Whitaker plays a tourist with a cam corder. I just named off a couple of examples. The last point of view is a spoiler, so I won't post it. Vantage Point shows all of the points of view. At the end of the film, it all comes together. Vantage Point is a short film of an hour and twenty-five minutes. Do to bad reviews, I wouldn't have given it a chance. I saw it on Starz one weekend and really liked it. I'm really glad I didn't miss out on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpectedly good showing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really didn't expect too much from this movie as I started watching it. But in the end, it ended up keeping me figuratively at the edge of my seat more than any movie in a long time. Exactly why? It's hard to say. I suppose it's how the different elements of the film play together so well.The "recursive" style the first half or so of this movie was shot in definitely was a big factor. Since the events are replayed from many perspectives, it kind of leaves you with several "cliffhangers" throughout the first part of he movie, as well as paces the film well. Some might dislike the style and consider it just an annoyance - and heck, I usually hate stuff like series episodes that recount previous episodes etc. But in this case, this method just works, and keeps you gripped as you wait for more of the plot to reveal itself.Once the continuous part of the film starts, it's basically packed with well-directed fast-paced action as the preludes from the different viewpoints start to combine into linear real-time story progression. Acting in the movie was quite respectable throughout the movie. There's a few faces like Dennis Quaid and Forest Whitaker (and to a lesser extent Sigourney Weaver, but only because she doesn't get much screen time) that you know to expect a decent performance from, but the less known folks mostly put up a decent showing as well.Overall, the film puts together some conventional and less conventional elements in a convincing manner, backed up with nice overall acting, directing and story-telling. Pacing is good, and keeps the adrenaline pumping and the mood intense. There's no big weaknesses in my books. I suppose the closest thing would be the ending, as it is slightly "cheesy", but it does wrap up the different viewpoints quite effectively.It might not be the greatest masterpiece of all time, but definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The rewinding after each point of view was rather annoying, but apart from this, the thriller element won me over and I was on the edge of my seat. The fast pace kept my attention, and after the initial re-showing of the basic sequence of events from several vantage points, the mystery began to be explained. As the story reached its climax, it was gripping and reminded me of the intensity of 24 - there wasn't a moment when you could relax. I think the ending was satisfying because the "good" people survived, and the "bad" were exposed, and the secret service agent played by Dennis Quaid was victorious. I think suspension of disbelief is always necessary in this type of story, and if you can do that, it's very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dennis Quaid and William Hurt star in this action thriller with a twist (or better yet, gimmick): the events leading up to the attempted assassination of an American president who is visiting Spain are told from several individuals' points of view. These include Quaid as a Secret Service agent, Hurt as the president, Forest Whittaker as a camcorder-wielding tourist and Edgar Ramirez (a Javier Bardem lookalike) as a Spanish cop. Bruce McGill is the president's hawkish adviser. VANTAGE POINT is fine if you can take the constant rewinding of events to show them from each character's perspective. Personally, I would have preferred fewer rewinds. For my money, Whitaker's overly excited tourist walks away with the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie that flew under the radar. I never heard of it till I saw it on cable. The movie is about 90 minutes long and solves the mystery of a presidential assignation. The movie repeats the same 20 minutes in time a few times, each time from the perspective of a different character. There is Agent Barnes, whom is back on the job after taking a bullet for the President, an undercover cop assigned to protect the mayor, a tourist played by Forrest Whitaker, and the president himself.Each time, the story goes a little further and we learn more about what is really happening. Soon, we learn there is more to what happened than the president being shot and a bomb going off. There is a lot more going on behind the scenes and this is a well planned plot by the terrorist.Some of the story does seem a little far fetched, but it is still entertaining and at the end, all the events are pulled together.FINAL VERDICT: Suspenseful.

		<fullReview>Vantage Point is a very, very good film. By all means, this is quite a serious warning to all of us that terrorism really knows no borders and can get you no matter where you may find yourself here or there. The very method of shooting the scenes is pretty mesmerizing ? we see the tragic events of the terrorists attack on the US President through the eyes of several people ? the President's bodyguard, a Black tourist, a TV reporter and so on. And when the camera winds the events back, to the very beginning, we feel a sudden sharp anguish to know the truth. The way Forest Whittaker, Sigourney Weaver and other play is excellent, but the only weak point in the movie is the final moment when the main terrorist sees a child, Ana, and doesn't run her over in his car? This sudden act of mercy does totally contradict his character and makes a final a bit too syrupy. Apart from that, the film is very strong and gives you a grave warning ? terrorism knows no limits?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Vantage Point" takes on a unique perspective for an action film. It shows the assassination of the U.S. President from eight separate points of view, and each time the new vantage point reveals something new about what is really going on. To some this may seem tedious, though I found it increasing engaging and suspenseful with each new point of view. The acting is good here. Dennis Quaid is truly engaged in his role, and one can feel the pressure and stress he must be under at the time. While the film is tons of fun to watch and try to figure out, it is not without a few flaws. First of all, there is almost no character development. The film moves along so quickly that we are really unable to learn very much about each individual character. We pick up that Forest Whitaker may be having trouble in his family life, but we do not really find out for sure. Dennis Quaid is stressed because he took a shot for the president the previous year, yet we do not find out much about him personally. It seems to me that everything turned out too coincidentally here, that everything just happened to come together at the end, just a bit unbelievable. Nevertheless, the film is not meant to be very monumental, and I found it very exciting and entertaining, being put at the edge of my seat. It's worth seeing and quite enjoyable, though don't expect a perfect film. One of the best from 2008 so far.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Vantage Point" seemed like a typical political thriller from the trailers featuring car chases, shootouts and explosions. In watching it, you can see that it is pretty much just that with its plot of presidential assassination and some clever terrorists who are one step ahead of the way throughout most of the movie. This is nothing unfamiliar to anyone who has seen a few action movies in this type. Where "Vantage Point" steps away from the crowd is by literally showing us the same set of events from different viewpoints one at a time. The film literally rewinds and we are placed in a new position to see the same thing over again.This allows much greater attention to each unfolding story line as each is viewed on its own. The story develops as if it were after the incident and the audience is looking through an investigator's point of view as they collect information from witnesses. It is frustrating as the information comes in pieces that can only be added up to a whole once they have all been examined. With every rewind and restart there is some redundancy to be gone through only to be given the next piece of incomplete information. With this unconventional approach "Vantage Point" strives to be about something more than just a typical action movie. The new perspective forces a new look at this typical formula. For instance in one view point we have a secret service man hesitating whether to make a call about a suspicious window and in the next view point we see that someone in the audience sees him looking and looks back and forth amongst the windows to get a glimpse of what could possibly be happening. In any linear sequence much of these shots would be cut for pacing and time, but in this arrangement with each perspective shown separately you are given each character's moment in the scene uncut. This, in effect, makes film slightly repetitive, but it also gives it a more detailed thoroughness that would make the scene seem dragged out in a linear arrangement of events.This all serves as a setup for the climatic scene where everyone's role becomes clear. "Vantage Point" may not be truly an original an daring thriller as it bears several clichés. However, with its interestingly unfolding story and plot twists it is most definitely a solid action thriller. --- 8/10BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good assassination movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed Travis' film about the attempt of an assassination on American President at a anti-terrorism conference in Spain. It features good performances from Quaid and Fox as well Whitaker. I liked the way the director approached the idea and it was a good entertaining movie for the most part. Don't look for too much substance or for it to make an out of the ordinary statement, but its a good action movie of its sort. I liked the cinematography by Amir. Mokri, and thought it was edited well too. Overall not an amazing movie, but worth watching. Good job by production team -IMDB Rating: 6.7. sdfkjsdflkjsdflkjsdf sdflkjsldkfjsMY Rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Greatly Put Together Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point is a movie directed by Pete Travis and written by Barry Levy. The movie follows the events of the president getting shot and goes through several different characters or different points and shows the event as they see it and what happens to them. The cast includes Denis Quad, Mathew Fox, William Hurt, Forrest Whitaker and Sigourney Weaver.This movie was well under the radar for me as I didn't hear of it until seeing the trailer on a DVD for some over movie; I think it was "The Assignation of Jesse James by The Coward Robert Ford." So once seeing the trailer I automatically thought this looked like a ripper of a movie and I wasn't let down.The story is greatly written and intertwined, i couldn't help but wonder how awkward and mind bending it would be to have read it on script.Great acting by all in the cast, except for Mathew Fox, for me he just seemed like a less talkative Jack. Forrest Whitaker took the highlight for me though; he always steals the screen in a movie and doesn't fail here. His facial and tone just puts through to you the character greatly and makes you understand who is a lot better. Dennis Quad is his usual self and not much to say there, he is an American tough guy actor. I also though the two less Hollywood actors Edgar Ramirez and Said Taghmaoui did great job in portraying their characters and were stern on screen.The movie was put together and shot great, when you just think you're about to find out something from the plot the rewind happens the camera angles are lined up great to keep you guessing.I quite enjoyed this movie and found nothing at all bad about it. I'm giving it 7 and a half President shooting stars.7.5 - www.dylanreviews.ning.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different views</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only in the movie itself, but also as far as the reviews/voting/ratings are concerned here on IMDb. Of course everyone has their opinion on any other subject matter, that's why it's always interesting to read other peoples views, to see from which point or perspective they viewed the movie.Having said that, which could easily be seen as a smooth intro into this movie (I hope you'll see it that way), this movie has a political message, but it doesn't thrive on it too much. The movie's purpose is to entertain the audience and not to make them political activists. There's still nuances and (political) criticism to be found here, if you look closely.The whole movie is gravitated by Dennis Quaids performance. Of course this is an ensemble piece/movie and the other actors are great too, but he's the one, that grabs our attention the most. Which helps you go through the first 10 to 20 minutes of the movie. They're a bit slow (especially compared to the finale of the movie) to say the least. You can also criticize the movie for it's dialogue, the fact that it seems to go in different directions, once it starts, but then again, these things were all done on purpose.Try to enjoy it is what I'm saying and don't go into the movie, trying to spot every little continuity error. Here's where I have to point out one thing I read in another review. Again I respect the fact, that the reviewer didn't like the movie, but he was angry at the movie, because it was shot in Mexico, pretending that to be Spain. Well suffice to say, that the reviewer is from Spain, so he should know if that is true or not. But saying that's a bad/negative thing and asking, if Europeans would do the same is hypocritical. Because Europeans have done the same. German westerns shot in the former Yugoslavian Republic, pretending that was America! Or even the Italian (Spaghetti) Western mostly shot in Spain(!) also pretending that was the USA!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is just plain awesome! i gave it 9 because Its one of those action packed thrillers where your dad goes " Oh it was him ! he did it!" gets really cocky about it and it was someone so unexpected. This is because most people cannot guess what will happen because the movie is ingeniously clever. The action sequences are very well handled. Many people say that they got very bored watching the explosion again and again , but i found this interesting as each time you see it from a different view point and each time it gives something else away and leaves you on a cliffhanger, wondering what will happen next. This stylish action packed thriller is great for all the family!YOU'LL LOVE IT - unless you don't ?!:P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always have liked thrilling exciting films that also were puzzling for various reasons.Vantage Point is such a film. It examines an assassination from the viewpoints of a few of the many spectators, There are many surprises in the fast 90 minute (including 6 minutes of credits)running time.Pete Travis ably directed from Barry Levy's screenplay. NOW in films like this down thru time, the screenplay we watch rarely was logical or made much sense. We do not see thrillers for great stories. We see them for excitement's sake.The acting by a large cast both known &amp; little known actors are all first rate. Since the film was made in both Spain &amp; Mexico many non-Americans are cast in various roles to great effect .Dennis Quaid does his usual great job, so does Forrest Whittaker, Sigourney Weaver, Mathew Fox &amp; William Hurt. also cast are Spanish,Mexican actors Eduardo Noriega &amp; Edgar Ramirez &amp; are as expected just first rate.One other actress I must mention is Ayelet Zurer . This fine actress played Eric Bana's wife in MUNICH, 2 years ago &amp; here she gives another fine performance.This is a worthwhile film, just sit back &amp; ignore the improbabilities of the story. NOTE. Any one remember how improbable North by Northwest was. We watched &amp; enjoyed the goings on.Ratings; ***1/2 (out of 4) 96 points(out of 100)'IMDB 9 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprisingly fresh for a relatively unknown director , perhaps , the best ultra-real action film of the year , 1000% better then self-proclaimed pure action like Wanted !A story of an abduction of the US president , played by great W. Hurt, is somehow reminiscent of the following genre of macabre war thrillers : The Domino Principle , The Parallax View , Enemy of the State , except that it is told from different perspectives, thus the title ! Great acting by everyone ( D. Quaid is brilliant as always ) , fast-paced camera angles , and great car chase, totally believable with Opel cars !The only minus to this film if you like waiting for the end credits : it was made in Mexico and not in Spain 's Salamanca , but still convincing ! Perhaps one of the best films of the year !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i didn't know what to expect from this film. i can say that there were plenty of plot twists that will surprise you and keep you interested throughout the movie. one annoying factor is the constant rewinding back to 12:00 noon. that part gets very annoying but its pertinent to each perspective being told.another part i didn't like was the subtle clue to who was involved in the plot(quaids partner or whoever.dude from party of 5) because it made me automatically point out that he was involved nearly an hour and a half before he was actually implicated. if you notice when he's talking to Quaid in the car and Quaids just talking about being around and thanks him and his partner makes a face and says "Dont thank me yet" ..very subtle clue that goes thru one ear and out the other of most but once i heard it i knew he was either involved or was gonna be killed pretty soon, i was sure he was involved and just as i suspected he was. a movie is never as good to me when i pretty much figure it out early.Forest Whitaker gives another great performance, albeit a small one. he was charming, informative, curious and even remorseful all in one character. he risks his life for a little girl who he previously had bumped into and keeps her out of harms way to find her mother after an explosion, these events magnify the events going on in his own life(battle with his wife) and make them actually seem much smaller when he thinks about it...good addition to the movie the whole subplot with the one guys brother being kidnapped has nothing to do with the movie. i don't know why it was in there but it easily could have been done without....the remote controlled gun was amazing lol.. that part surprised me a lot.overall a decent movie but if you expect it to be groundbreaking throughout you will be a little disappointed.</fullReview>

Its a thriller that you want to see to the end, and it got me on that, once I got past the first 15-20mins, I was interested to see what ends up in the story. It's not predicable, which is good. But the actual end scene (spoiler part) bothers me. If you have the president of the united states kidnapped in the back of your ambulance and see a kid in the middle of the street; if you know that if you swerve you're going to tip the ambulance, then you run over the kid, the damn kidnapped president of the united states is in the back of your ambulance, one kid in the street ain't sh*t.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusion and Terror from Multiple Vantages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story line of VANTAGE POINT is a brief one: a summit meeting on terrorism aimed at addressing the differences between the Arab world and the Western world is taking place in Salamanca, Spain and the arrival of the President of the United States is greeted with assassination attempts, terrorist explosions, and car chases. The difference in this thriller from the many others of the same genre is the use of telling the story from at least five different vantage points - the news reporters (Sigourney Weaver, Zoë Saldana and Staff), the CIA (Dennis Quaid, Matthew Fox, et al with William Hurt as the President), a group of terrorists, an American bystander with camera (Forest Whitaker), and the viewing public. Things are not as they initially seem and the more times the story is rerun through repetition of the incident, the more information is added. Based on a story by Barry Levy and directed by Pete Travis the film could become tiresome in its use of repeated reruns, but given the quality of the cast and the twists and turns as the 'plot' is further elucidated makes the story more of an investigation of Intelligence forces from all involved countries and drives home the reason 'terrorism' is so terrifying. Some of the peripheral cast members are particularly fine - Bruce McGill, Edgar Ramirez, Sa?d Taghmaoui, Ayelet Zurer, and Eduardo Noriega among others. It is a film that takes patience on the part of the viewer, but staying with it until the end results in some very fine entertainment. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring , dumb and predictable thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea for this movie was quite interesting . The cast was really good : William Hurt ( "The body heat") , Sigourney Weaver ("Aliens") , Dennis Quaid ("Interspace") Forest Whitaker ("Ghost dog") plus Zoe Saldana ("Avatar") . The expectations obviously were quite high. Unfortunately , it sucks.You're expecting a movie similar to Kurosawa's "Rashomon" ? intriguing and deep movie about how truth is subjective ? Go somewhere else. There is no substance , unless you consider simple message like "Terrorism is evil and all countries must fight against it together" a deep one.The cast is wasted. The screenplay doesn't offer them anything worthy of their acting abilities. Hurt plays a noble American president , Quaid is a noble Secret Service agent , Whitaker is a noble American tourist , Saldana is a honest TV reporter? Jesus ! How many noble people are here ?! Only Weaver is mildly interesting as the cynical news reporter. All the characters are shallow and lack depth. They have uninteresting and flat dialogues. What is worse the acting itself is pretty bad. Quaid is laughable as the copy of Clint Eastwood from "In the line of fire" , Saldana is annoying , Whitaker is pathetic . Only Hurt and Weaver come off in half-decent performances. I must also add that the non-star cast of the movie is just awful.The movie shows us the same situation from different perspectives. The problem is that is done here in such way that the viewer is simply bored , because the movie keeps repeating the scenes and dialogues we already seen. Sure , we get to see a little bit of new things with each point of view , but they are still boring. I was able to guess the most twists from a mile away. The movie is also incredibly stupid . None of the good guys gets hurt even a little despite all the danger. The behavior of Whitaker's character is completely unbelievable. The bad guys who were ruthless and logical in the end become careless and soft.The direction is completely flat. Like someone took out all the suspense from the movie . The car chase is not one bit exciting and takes too much time. Same goes for other action scenes in the movie.Overall , the best thing about this movie is that is short (not even 1hour 30 minutes). Other than that this is just a bad piece of movie making. I find it shocking that it has a decent rating on IMDb . 6.6 , people ? I've seen movies rated below 6.0 that are far better than this thrash. I give it 1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, But Not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point, starring Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox, had the workings of an amazing film. However, I felt it did not lead up to its expectations. The film plays and replays the points of views of 8 people. It was easy to catch on, which was great considering they did not preview the film with a flashback style, thus surprising the viewers. At the same time, I did find myself wondering if or when it would pick up and start moving forward in the story line. That is the difficult part with flashback films. It can either push the movie forward, or hold it back. It wasn't until the fourth or fifth flashback, around 35-40 minutes into the film, that I really started getting interested in the story. Maybe other viewers felt differently, but I thought the first few flashbacks were slow moving. Still, even with the slow beginning, I found value in those points of views and it did indeed help round out the story altogether. Another issue I had was the loose ends once the film finished. I won't spoil anything, but I felt as though the film could have continued for another 15 minutes just to explain certain things about those closely involved, especially the part played by Matthew Fox. The acting was great, in my opinion. In fact, the acting didn't hold back my vote at all on this film. If it hadn't been slow at the beginning, and tied up some loose ends, it would have been an easy 8 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At Least It's Entertaining...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, it's not the best movie. I originally reviewed this movie three years ago giving it a 9/10 and predicted Oscars for it. I'm retracting my statement and vote, first of all, and secondly, I want to tell you that this film kinda...well, sucks.Dennis Quaid, Sigourney Weaver, Forest Whitaker, Matthew Fox and William Hurt lead the ensemble cast of Vantage Point. It's actually quite pathetic that they could afford these big of names and it's still not a good movie, really. It can kill time and it's nice to watch the gun fights, but realistically, this thing is very, very over-the-top.I do not mind the fact that it rewinds back to 12:00 PM and shows five different viewpoints before continuing with the end of the story. I don't really mind the fact that one guy manages to kill about half a dozen secret service agents with ease. I don't mind the fact that the timing of the sections and flashbacks don't match up. I do mind one thing, though. At the end of the film, the leading terrorist decides to swerve the ambulance away from a little girl and it ends up destroying the whole plan and he gets killed.So, let me get this straight. This guy had no problem with killing upward of 500 people, including the president, but when it comes to a little girl and your ability to get away, you'd rather save the little girl? Bull crap! I had trouble viewing this movie for the second time considering I could tell some of the things in the movie didn't match up, but I let it slide because it's a movie and they're going to be mistakes and continuity. I realize that they won't be perfect on changing the viewpoint.As far as the movie goes in technical aspects...I can't see too much wrong with it. I mean the chase scenes are quite bland. I don't think it's realistic to see Forest Whitaker keeping up with policemen and secret service agents while filming at his height and weight. He's a big guy.I could probably go on and on about all the bad things about this movie. But it actually isn't all bad. At least it has some entertaining value and it plays out at a good pace. It's nice to watch some favourites like Dennis Quaid. I wouldn't recommend watching it to anyone unless of course you saw it already and you have nothing better to do. Otherwise, if you haven't seen it, don't bother. You aren't missing much. If you have seen it, well...it's your choice, but there's a million better movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>where did it all go wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pretty good premise for a film that just lost it's potential along the way. The resetting of the clock was clever but far, far overdone. Towards the end I was praying that they wouldn't do it yet again. The car chase scenes were good. Fast paced and well shot. The acting was OK - nothing brilliant but OK. But the thing that ruined the entire film for me was the scene of the young girl running through traffic, barely dodging the cars flying by. She ignores dozens of cars in her rush to get to her mother but she then, inexplicably, just freezes in the middle of the road after already crossing several lanes of traffic. Far too unbelievable but I suppose forgivable as a prop to build tensions while we wait for the next flashback to see how it turns out.And then, the "pi?ce de résistance" was the terrorist who had just cold-bloodedly massacred so many without hesitation, swerving to miss this child and destroying his entire plan of kidnapping the president and bringing America to it's knees ... he kills dozens of women and children and yet throws everything away, crashing his ambulance to avoid running the child down. This absurd plot device allows Denis Quaid to catch him on foot. What a ridiculous way to end a movie. Makes you ask, just what the hell was the director/writer thinking? Could have been another great action thriller if handled with just a little more care but it doesn't even rate as half-arssed the way it is. Maybe a "director's cut" is waiting somewhere to salvage this from a B-movie classification. There MUST be a great film lying somewhere on the cutting-room floor.</fullReview>

All of this make the movie enjoyable to watch even for a person not thriller fan like myself.Not much to comment about acting in an action movie like this. They are all average with an exception. Forest Withaker manages to add a touch of his enormous talent with ease and sensibility as he always does. What a great actor.This movie has few flaws for sure, but not many and pardonable in front of such thrilling experience. Maybe just worth mentioning the story, which is stupid, superficial, and makes me sick because of propaganda. But definitively not boring. Oh, and always before a car crush, collision, bullet or sudden death everyone has to say something like sheet - this is childish.Overall great thriller, it delivers what you would expect from such genre.

Barnes actually recovering POTUS after chasing someone else? And after all that motion and action, knowing that he was located exactly "seven blocks east of the plaza" without even taking a serious look around? Nah, I'm sorry, the possibility of kidnapping the POTUS is remote but could still happen, however it couldn't EVER go down the way it is portrayed in the movie. For me, that's totally OK.

		<fullReview>Vantage Point (VP) is a neat idea which ultimately betrays itself - it's somewhat reminiscent of Snake Eyes (although this isn't nearly as stylish as De Palma's movie). In both films a politician is shot (in VP, the US President during a visit in Spain), and characters have to discover the truth putting together various pieces of the puzzle (video footage, different viewpoints...).Dennis Quaid is OK as the tough special agent, although he could play this kind of role in his sleep. Matthew Fox is lackluster, like in the first seasons of Lost (he did improve later). The always brilliant Forest Whitaker brings some vivid humanity to his underwritten character. William Hurt plays the president, while Sigourney Weaver is barely in the movie at all.Unfortunately, like Snake Eyes, VP abandons its interesting premise and solves the whole thing with a colossal deus-ex-machina/cop-out. "Unsatisfying" doesn't quite convey it. The movie is all first and middle act, and lacks a compelling resolution.5/10</fullReview>

Add to that a high concept film-making gimmick badly executed, with a wrapping so loose and flimsy that you have to stuff it full of red herrings just to make it look taut and interesting. Sprinkle liberally with far-fetched "plot" twists and coat with bombastic excess. Bake for 90 minutes in the fires of wooden acting and pop culture cliché. When it comes out, realise how awful you've mucked it up and tack on a gratuitous chase scene. Watching a badly produced episode of "24" from ten angles doesn't make it better, it makes it a monumentally stupid film.

		<fullReview>We fallow journalists at the scene where world leaders are gathered to discuss terrorism. And then it happens. President is shot and a bomb explodes. The tension is high and there is a lot of excitement. But the film stops and we leave the scene. We go back 23 min and now we follow another person's vantage point to the incident. Then it stops again and we go back and follow another person's vantage point. Stops and repeats; stops and repeats; stops and repeats. Yes, the same scene repeats 6 times and it kills all the fun. It made me even dislike the explosion. Then the movie continues normally with a lot of tension and excitement, until it is ruined in the end. And the end makes me forget all the good qualities of the movie. You have to see it to understand it. (Or if you want a description of the scene, you can find it at the end of the review) If you do not care about the end of a movie and can live with watching the part of the movie (I think it was 10 min or something) over and over again, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, if you are going to watch the movie, make sure to get it on DVD so that you can skip the repeated parts. SPOILER!!!!! The last scene; what is not good with it? Well everything is bad. I am going to describe the scene first and then point out all the bad sides. At the very last scene, the terrorist has the president in the ambulance. They are driving at top speed and want to get away as soon as possible. Meanwhile, a girl is lost and is trying to find her mother. Se sees her over the street and runs across the street. She dodges a couple of cars in the street but suddenly stops in the middle of the street. Why does she stop? Well for the ambulance that is like 50 meters away. While she just runs past other cars that are like 10 meters away, she suddenly gets scared and stops in the middle of the road for an ambulance that like 50 meters away. Meanwhile, the terrorist driving the ambulance sees the girl. The terrorist has killed at least 50 people, but he suddenly gets sympathy for the girl and tries to make a U-turn to not hit the girl. Seriously, the terrorist killed many other peoples and did not think about it, but he just can't kill a girl to not die. That does not make any since at all. When he tries to make U-turn, his ambulance tip over and an agent comes and kills him and saves the president. I have to say that his is the worst ending a movie can have. I would have given the movie 6/10 if it weren't for the ending. And if the movie didn't contained so much flash backs, it would have gotten 10/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but not particularly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'd just like to say that this movie was fun to watch. It's hardly great art, but if you're just looking to be entertained for an hour and a half you could do a lot worse. With that said, it's time for the criticism.Probably my biggest issue with the movie is that it's repetitive. The way it works is that with every "point of view" the movie is rewound to where it started, showing what happened from that character's point of view, with more being revealed with each character. While it's an innovative premise, the film doesn't really offer any variety; each character sees essentially the same thing, so a great deal of the movie is just you being forced to watch something you've already seen from a slightly different perspective.My second biggest issue with the movie: Dennis Quaid. He delivers some of the most unintentionally hilarious lines in the movie, and his character spends the entire movie looking confused/angry/constipated. Although some of this can be blamed on a bad script, he manages to make already-bad lines unbelievable. However, for me at least, this added to the entertainment factor- a few moments left me rolling in my seat.A few more issues; the movie falls back on stock characters (the kind father who's estranged from his wife, the tough policeman (well, secret service agent) dealing with trauma), and its attempts at suspense or dramatic tension seem forced and sophomoric.All in all, this movie was enjoyable to watch; there's a car chase, plenty of explosions, and enough shooting to keep your eyes glued to the screen. However, a bad script and irritating repetition keep the movie from being genuinely good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this won't revolutionize the medium, it is a worthwhile entry to it as well as to its genre, and that, I say, ought to always be recognized. Far from all films are, and not everything could, or should, "change the game"; what would we have to compare them to? I remember thinking this would be about an investigation, where what this or that person saw would have to be put together. It isn't. This is about an assassination attempt on the US President, and it "rewinds" itself(usually leaving us with a cliffhanger) to before it occurs every time we've seen someone's perspective on it, to grant us another look, and gradually, the audience pieces it all together. Arguably a gimmick, this use of a non-linear time-line is used well. The plot is very engaging, and other than its conclusion(admittedly could have used work, though I can't claim that I can offhand think of something better; and it certainly is cool, and it does tie up all loose ends), it's satisfying. Well, with a couple of minor exceptions; not all pay-offs in this are created equal. Exposition is delivered smoothly, and nothing in the well-written and tight script(with razor-sharp dialog) of this is excessive. The many twists are convincing and keep you guessing. This rewards viewers who pay attention to it, and feels realistic. The pace is fast, and this is immensely gripping from start to finish. I could not take my eyes off it. The tension is thick throughout. There is action, too, such as chase sequences, and it is as effective as that as it is as a thriller. The 80 minutes fly by. Every character is a fleshed out, developed human being, no one is good or evil(with that said, don't expect everything to be explained in detail), and the acting is excellent, with some quite powerful performances, not merely from the big names. The editing and cinematography are magnificent, they really pull you in and put you right in the situation(if they do get to be flashy once or twice). This uses nearly no CGI whatsoever, and that's a positive. There is a bit of bloody violence several instances of disturbing content, and brief strong language in this. The DVD comes with an informative and fun director's commentary track, two interesting featurettes totalling 41 minutes, three trailers and one deleted scene. Exciting, entertaining, smart, and just plain *fun*. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys this sort of picture. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The President's Been Shot. ...Again and Again and Again and Again and Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with VANTAGE POINT is that it doesn't take into consideration two very important things: the point of view of the watcher, and a believable storyline. Let me explain...Seeing a situation/crime/etc. from different points of view might be interesting to some. But if you're going to do that, you need to make sure that there are engaging points that aren't repeated ad nauseam. You might think that four or five points of view would be the maximum allowable for something like this. And you'd probably be right. But how about six? Or seven? Too many? Would you believe this one has eight?! Far, far, far too many. And they all start just about the same place, which grated on the nerves after a short while.The storyline is pretty ridiculous, too. Doppleganger Presidents. Double Secret Service agents. Terrorists who need to hire an assassin. And an ending that is pure schlock.Not being that much of a fan of Dennis Quaid didn't help matters for me either ? the only two films with him in them that I enjoyed were ENEMY MINE and THE BIG EASY. The rest of his movie repertoire is questionable to say the least; JAWS 3-D, YOURS, MINE AND OURS, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, etc.I will say, however, that the action was fun to watch. And seeing William Hurt (INTO THE WILD) get shot multiple times was pretty enjoyable, too. But that's where my enjoyment stopped. Matthew Fox (SPEED RACER) as agent Kent Taylor was completely miscast and unbelievable. But probably the most miscast of all the characters was Forest Whitaker. Having seen Whitaker in THE LAST KING OF Scotland, I know what he's capable of. Here, he seemed like an overweight but athletic American out of his league carrying a video camera through Spain because ...well ...we're not sure.The big and final letdown was the ending of this film. If terrorists are prepared to kill, maim, and destroy innocent people in order to get to the President of the United States, would running over a girl stop them? I doubt that. Which made me nearly turn off the film. But we had to have a happy ending, sweet and sticky, with Quaid saving the day. Ugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worst Movie of the last two years. Absurd. It is fine to structure a movie around multiple points of view. But when the plot of the movie is this ridiculous, it's just a flashy scam for having no story and no characters. The A list cast do their best, but cannot escape the hollow characterizations and morass of pointless plot points around them. It doesn't work as a drama, an action movie or a political thriller. The trailer looked promising, but it proved to be smoke and mirrors. This film is snake oil, and an absolute mess. The conclusion becomes absurd comedy. No spoilers here, because there is nothing to spoil. This turkey was rancid at the script. I hope the people at the studio who helped greenlight this crap got fired. And I hope the writer got rich by selling his trash, and retires from the film business forever. If I ever meet him face to face, he'd better have my 13 dollars on him, or I'm taking it out of his hide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just wasted almost 90 minutes. I say almost 90 minutes because without the credits they could not even stretch it that far and that includes a car chase that seems to go on and on and on and on. They could have made a great film but misfired badly. With Forrest Whitaker, Sigourney Weaver, Matthew Fox, Dennis Quaid, William Hurt, and Bruce McGill they had a great cast and gave them nothing. Too bad. I was looking forward to watching this. This story of the attempted assassination of the president at a worldwide summit could have been a blockbuster. The only thing I liked about this was the attempt to make it different by going back to see the attempt from different character's vantage point. But even that was a problem because you could not get involved emotionally with the characters. Please avoid this movie</fullReview>

Getting the plot developing from eight different viewpoints, each one successively revealing a little more of the bigger picture was not boring even though necessarily repetitive in the key parts. In fact I was engrossed. The script was well done, the direction and pacing just right, the performances convincing enough to keep the momentum going and the climax worked very well.All in all, a satisfying movie experience.

		<shortDescription>Vantage Point Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point When something pivotal happens in history, how many individual stories are there about the event? No doubt that there are hundreds, but in Vantage Point we see an assassination attempt on the President of the United States from eight points of view. Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver), the GNN news room director, Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid), the Secret Service Agent who still suffers from a previous injury, Howard Lewis (Forest Whitaker), a separated husband and father traveling through Europe, Spanish Police Officer Enrique (Eduardo Noriega), who is involved with a woman he suspects of double crossing him, President Ashton (William Hurt), Javier (Edgar Ramirez), a Spanish special forces member who's brother is being held hostage, Suarez (Said Taghmaoui), the leader of the terrorist cell, and Kent Taylor (Matthew Fox), as a Secret Service Agent with a hidden agenda.Vantage Point was an exciting, visceral ride that had a riveting story, and a great ensemble cast. The movie starts explosively as GNN (if you hadn't guessed it, this film worlds version of CNN), covers the opening of a summit in Spain to bring an end to terrorism. In an open square, just as he is about to speak, the President of the United States (Hurt) is shot by unknown assailants, and several explosions rock the city, and the story unfolds. Special Agent Barnes (Quaid), who was previously injured protecting the President, is back on the job and suffering from flashbacks. After the attack, he's back in action, stopping Enrique (Eduardo Noriega) from rushing the stage, reviewing the footage shot by Howard Lewis (Whitaker), and then looking through the GNN footage where he makes an alarming discovery.The last half of the movie is full of double crosses involving Veronica (Ayelet Zurer), terrifying action as a hotel is assaulted, and a spectacular car chase reminiscent of the Bourne series.The method in which each point of view is told is perhaps not clever, but different ? fading to black, and resetting the clock to 12:00 pm, to the sound of the city's church bells chiming. This is something I wanted to address, because in the crowd I attended the movie with, there seemed to be a great deal of dissatisfaction with this storytelling device. I found myself enjoying the movie and "getting" what the filmmakers were attempting, however there was a general crowd reaction that consisted of laughing and booing. I suppose I find this generally consistent with the trend of American moviegoers to voice their opinions to those around them, even if we don't want to hear it! I know this is supposed to be a movie review, however more and more it's about the experience. I'm actually surprised that movie theaters have been able to stay in business, as customer on customer rudeness has easily doubled in the last few years. In the past year I have had precisely one enjoyable experience, and that was Sweeny Todd. A hint to fellow film-goers ? save the talking for after the film!</fullReview>

I forgot to hit pause on the DVD player, but when I came back from the kitchen the movie was playing the exact scene I had just saw, which was strange. I began to think that my rental copy had a scratch on it. When I started eating my new batch of popcorn, it tasted like vomit as well. I don't know why I kept ignoring the obvious. I guess it's because I wanted to like the movie because the commercial was cool, it had Jack from Lost, and I wanted to justify the money I spent renting it. The popcorn kept tasting like vomit because I threw up in my mouth every time I had to keep watching the same scene over and over again. Oh, and the character development was so deep...watching Jack's hand slip out of Rose's grip was gut-wrenching.

It has everything in common with an episode of 24 rather than one of the greatest films of all time. Yes, Vantage Point relies on multiple perspective storytelling but that DOES NOT = Rashamon! Rashamon did something that Vantage Point completely overlooked, and that was exploring character's motives and reason for the different accounts, rather than just showing eight different camera angles!!!The best guide I can give you is the audience's reaction from last night.. - There were increasingly audible groans and sighs during the irritating 'rewind' sequences - There were people laughing AT the movie during the last 20 minutes as the action took on a hilarious rather than exciting quality - The dialogue, particularly in the final few scenes, raised further guffaws. It is so cheesy you will find yourself chewing your fist in embarrassment.Were we really meant to take this seriously???Then again, this is a great movie for fans of 'spotting continuity errors' and Service agents with unlimited pistol ammo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action film done with a little bit of a Bourne Ultimatum feeling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people compare this movie as the action-styled Rashomon. I never have seen Rashomon, but from seeing this movie, I can say it is well made, not just because of its intense action sequences but also from its unique story.Vantage Point is about the president's assassination attempt told through the eyes of eight strangers. Since this movie has eight different characters portrayed in a ninety minute time frame, the first hour is about how each character is connected to the story. The film does it in an unusual technique of showing a character to a certain point and then fades to black, backtracking to the start with a new character. This seemed to annoy many people in the theater with me, but I found this to be a good method used by the editor Stuart Baird, who has many years of experience of being a film editor and director (although he didn't direct this film). In fact, this method made me more interested in the movie rather if it had just jumped around back-and-forth between each character, going forward with the story and not backtracking. Then I would have been confused and may have missed some things. The last half hour of the film then ties the ending together with a little bit of a shaky camera, but well-executed action sequences that remind me much of Paul Greengrass' work of The Bourne Ultimatum.Now I say it has a little bit of the Bourne Ultimatum feel not just because of the action, but the film itself flew by. I was not bored with a single second of it. I was so interested in it that I did not even bother to try to think who done it, but rather just watch and see for myself. The actors were decent in their roles, particularly with Will Hurt as the President and Dennis Quaid as the hero secret agent. The story was very interesting. And once again, I have to say I enjoyed the action parts. There are still some questions though that still rings to mind about the movie with some of the certain brief side plots, but there wasn't much breathing room to put every single detail together in an hour and a half, unless of course I missed some things, but I usually don't. It's a good 90 minute diversion. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts off well, showing the shooting of the president and the bombing of the square from the viewpoint of different people. Each time, a little more is revealed: the person shot wasn't the president, the Spanish undercover agent's girlfriend has a hidden agenda, people are being blackmailed, etc.But the last part losses it all. The "happy end" is that the president survives (who cares about all the dead), and that's after a long, totally unrealistic, car chase, which actually contributes nothing to the plot. The president is saved because the ambulance he's being hijacked in crashes (of course, of walking distance to the place the car chase ends - but the car wasn't chasing the ambulance); the crash takes out the two drivers strapped in their seat belts, but the president in the back, not strapped in, has hardly a scratch.Right.A totally pointless movie, IMO.</fullReview>

There is maybe 30 minutes of actual plot, Its like they shot the movie, found out they didn't have enough filmed, so they decided to replay the same scene like 6 times, by the 3rd time you just say to yourself enough, get on with the movie. About half the people in the theatre walked out after the 4th reenactment of the same scene. I did however finish the movie, thinking maybe it would have some redeeming natures. after they expanded the plot past the same event, it got a little better, but by the time the movie was over you think back and for an hour and a half the following happened; Man wakes up, protects president double, president double gets shot, stage blows up, body guard figures out its a double, goes after a rouge agent thats responsible for the shooting, catches guy, and it just so happens that after the real president attacked the driver who abducted him at the exact place the agent happened to be, end of movie... At least if this movie had been sent to straight to DVD(as it should have) for 15 dollars i could have bought the movie and been able to burn it after wasting 2 hours of my life.</fullReview>

The whole thing seemed to be contrived. There where too many coincidences in this film.If you like to be spoon fed all the answers you will like this film. If you want a thriller with any real intelligence, substance and realism don't watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful New Way to Watch an Action Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall this movie was great. The critics had an unnecessary hay-day with this one. From what I saw the audience in the theatre was interactive and captured by the show. They were all gasping and nail biting when needed. This new take on view was fun and stimulating. Of course there were the clichés and typical implausible action scenes but it is Hollywood and anything can happen. There twists and plot were definitely unpredictable and that was splendid, especially when I have a particular knack for guessing what is about to take place. The set-up was perfect, building you up to the climax and then taking it away right before you see too much. From the reviews, it seems as though people thought of it as a nuisance but like the name of the movie, "Vantage Point," going back to the beginning to see another perspective was the whole point. So, if someone were going to criticize this movie for this reason then it would be absolutely pointless because that was the films main objective. One problem or, maybe for some, one good thing about this anticlimax is the viewer will feel as though they were only in the theatre for a half hour.Next, I read a review from a so-called critic claiming that the audience wasn't given enough of the terrorist's motives or characters backgrounds. Apparently the film focused too much time on one character but not enough on another. First, the terrorist's motives were pointless for this movie. This movie was scripted to give the viewers different point of views for one major event in order to reveal why they all found themselves in the final scene. Any more information would have interrupted the overall theme. The point is? I don't need to know what the motives of the terrorists are because that wasn't the intent of the movie. I don't need to know more about Barnes (Dennis Quaid) and who tried to assassinate the person the first time. It is essential that you see Whitaker's point of view because he was a character holding a piece of the "whodunit" puzzle. Each characters point of view was quick and to the point? enough said. As for the cast, I think they were all selected wonderfully. The only problem I found was Matthew Fox. Unfortunately, he is a typecast actor and I will forever struggle see him outside of his role as Jack in "Lost." This just may be a personal opinion but hey this is my damn review, right? He is a great actor but every time I watch him I find it hard to believe his role. I had the same problem in "We Are Marshalls." Sorry Fox but you belong on the island. Overall, it has been a while since I have seen such a gripping action thriller so I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I definitely recommend the movie to whomever but I will give the advice to not get too frustrated when they flash back countless times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The President of the United States is assassinated at an Anti-terrorist summit in Spain viewed by every single news camera in the world and watched by millions of people. I'm not talking real here; I'm talking about the inventive storyline to "Vantage Point". It is a movie with a great storyline, actors, dialogue and most of all, action sequences. Each scene is played out perfectly and intrigued me from start to finish. The core elements of "Vantage Point" are what make it a very worthwhile film. When these elements are executed on screen, the film possesses just one problem.The film succeeds in answering the what if question about the President being assassinated at an anti-terrorist summit. The film does answer all of these questions including who would do it, how they would do it and why they would do it. The films basic plot is about a group of Arab extremists who want to kill the President at an Anti-terrorist summit in Spain. The reason for doing this is to retaliate against the United States because they had intercepted a bomb exchange between the terrorist group and another terrorist militia. The sub-plot to which the movie is actually based consists of the Point of views of twelve people who watch the President's assassination and the events after that. All of the characters give stellar performances, including a very impressive Forrest Whitaker who plays a tourist named Howard Lewis.The same everyday characters that one would expect to be at a Presidential speech are actually in this film. Writer Barry Levy gives us the Tourist (Whitaker), the Presidents bodyguards (Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox), the news reporters (Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldana), the President himself (William Hurt), the habitants of the city in Spain (Eduardo Noriega, Ayelet Zular, Dolores Heredia), and the terrorists whose names I won't mention because I'll ruin the story. I have to give thumbs up to Dennis Quaid and Forrest Whitaker whose performances are definitely Oscar-Worthy and deserve some recognition. Other performances are great too; even William Hurt does a great job as the President. However, I still think the best President is Harrison Ford.Every word spoken by each character is informative and innovative and adds so much to the story I can't even criticize one thing. I was expecting those patriotic cliché's like "I trust you with my life" or "I serve the President and he means more to me than my own life". I didn't get any of those lines what I got was simple innovative lines like "The beauty of American arrogance is that they cannot imagine a world in which they are not a step ahead", a line that is said by one of the terrorists. The action sequences are spectacular in their own way as well. They involve a pulse pounding car chase, a pulse pounding on foot chase and an explosive scene involving the President getting assassinated and the explosive events following the shots fired.If the film does have any flaws it would be the constant rewinding of the twenty three minute period before the President is assassinated. This part is rewound six times and by the third time I was beginning to chuckle in my seat. I was getting tired of it happening and this is what causes this film to lose a perfect score. I thought that they could have played the twenty three minutes longer than the actual time and get everybody's point of view out there rather than the constant rewinding. However, it doesn't bother me that much because after the constant rewinding the movie explodes into high-octane action. Another problem would be the fact that Dennis Quaid can smash through buildings and other cars with his little Opel car and not get one scratch. Even when he gets hit by a transport truck and gets smashed into a wall he manages to get out and walk away unharmed and not bloody."Vantage Point" delivers what it promises the best possible way any movie of this caliber could ever do. Granted it does have its flaws but if they are pushed aside, the film is very good. The best thing about it is the performances by the actors who make the movie what it is. It's fun, it's thrilling and most of all it's enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is full of action. Too much actually, but it is still entertaining even though it was a bit drawn out and unrealistic. Good ole fashioned betrayal, but it is different/create. It is an interesting concept and can make you appreciate how intertwined our lives can be. At times it can be a bit long, but in the end it is worth in. The Spanish actors and actresses are very good at their solomn and mysterious expressions. This movie appreciates the individual (or at least makes the audience appreciate the individual). Matthew Fox is very respectable in this movie. Dennis Quade is a bit annoying with him tough guy attitude. Not him, just his character. It made me wonder if this is how Americans are actually viewed as. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be kind - don't rewind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happens when you put "Rashomon," "Groundhog Day," "In The Line Of Fire," "The Shooter" and "Dave" into a cinematic food processor? You get the newest Columbia release, "Vantage Point." And, like most copies, it is not as good as the original it came from. In this case, it is NOWHERE near as good ...A compelling premise with the star power of this effort (William Hurt, Forrest Whittiker - both Best Actor award winners - as well as Sigourney Weaver, Dennis Quaid, Matthew Fox and Bruce McGill, among others) should have brought forth a fascinating motion picture.It didn't.Director Pete Travis (in his feature film debut) chooses to bog the movie down by actually rewinding each scene after it takes place, forcing us to view a presidential assassination from the viewpoint of seven different people.Actually, it's not a viewpoint, but rather a separate sequence for each person involved, and, by the third rehash, the group I attended the screening with was openly disdainful.The plot of "Vantage Point" has President Ashton (Hurt) attending an anti-terrorist summit in Spain, only to be shot. He is protected by Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). This is sequence one.Rewind. Now the perspective is from Barnes' point-of-view, and it should have stayed there. He's the most important character of the film and the emphasis (which shifts to him later, anyway) could have just continued with his plot line.Barnes, who took a bullet for Ashton just six months earlier, is not sure he's ready to be back on the job again, but he's a trooper and does what he's told.Rewind.Now the focus shifts to Howard Lewis (Whittaker), a non-descript tourist who is filming everything on a video recorder. It seems that Howard is having marital troubles at home, but like a modern-day Abraham Zapruder, he duly records all pertinent and historical information.Rewind.Next we move to Enrique (Eduardo Noriega), a bodyguard to the mayor of the host city. He catches his girlfriend seemingly flirting with Javier (Edgar Ramirez), and when the president is shot, he is captured by Barnes and assumed to be an accessory to the crime.Rewind.Next we start focusing on a group of Middle Eastern terrorists. And, frankly, by this time, the entire audience was ready to strap a bomb around their collective waists and set it off. When the sequence centered on a little girl that Howard bumped into at the summit, all hope of recovery was lost.We later find out that Javier's brother has been kidnapped, the president isn't who he is supposed to be, dozens of Secret Service agents are really easy for one man to kill, news director Sigourney Weaver is one of the few characters not to get her own plot line, there's a traitor in the Secret Service, it's relatively simple to execute a wild car chase down the crowded, narrow streets of a Spanish city and terrorists - no matter how evil - have a soft spot in their hearts for little girls who wander onto busy highways.Yes, that last little item put this movie over the top and into the dumpster for me. A violent, heartless terror cell willing and able to kill hundreds, if not thousands, is brought to its knees by a small moppet who never learned how to cross the street properly.So, after all of the slayings (most EVERYONE dies in this misadventure), beatings, explosions and rehashed sequences, there's really no vantage and no point to this film at all.In fact, it's the paying audience who will be at a real disadvantage here, having to sit through seven bad short films which add up to one big turkey shoot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately even with a unique and interesting premise a mediocre action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great cast and an interesting premise make this worth a watch following an assassination attempt on the US president and subsequent bombing in Spain which is then backtracked and shown from 8 different points of view as we try to unlock the truth. I really liked the idea of this movie unfortunately as clever and unique as it was it suffered from undeveloped characters and the viewpoints began to feel repetitive, (which yes I know tell-the-same-story-from-multiple-views is the hook of this movie but they were often identical.) There were a couple of surprising twists along the way as each perspective is fully revealed and I enjoyed Dennis Quaid and Forest Whitaker who for the most part carry the movie. There are some good action scenes, Quaid drives the hell out of a little car in an endless chase through the streets of Spain and Whitaker does a great job despite the fact that I never fully understood the motivation for anything his character is doing or why it was so important for him to film everything going on around him.Lots of cameos from well known actors along the way with all their multiple stories converging by the end and no finishing as who they initially appeared to be. Things did begin to feel a bit convoluted at that point and the actual ending was sudden and a bit too tidy. 5/29/16</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vantage Point (2008) is a very exciting film that is full of interesting twists and turns. All the actors do very well in it as well. Sigourney Weaver does a great job here, she gives a very dramatic and focused performance, even though her appearance in the film is rather brief. Dennis Quaid, the star of the film, does a pretty good job too, he is very believable in the role. I love how this film was shot, it was shot very beautifully, the setting was very pretty too, I loved the scenery in Spain. The script was well written as well, good dialogue between characters. Now there were a few scenes where the acting was just a little on the cheesy side, but like I said, it was just a few moments where the acting seemed a little wooden. This film is a good time to sit down and watch for a lot of fun action and an interesting plot. 7/10 for vantage point.</fullReview>

Too many repeated scenes without any good reason, boring chasing scenes, everything about this movie is bad. Only thing that is good is cast along above mentioned two actors there nare also Sigourney Weaver and Bruce McGill.. But even that could not make this movie worth watching. Main story is not even resolved and there is no room for sequel (thank God). There is mention of some kind of war but thats it. Side stories are pointless. I wasted my time watching this and i highly recommend that you don't waste your. 2 out of 10 just because respect i have for actors, otherwise pure 0.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would have worked better as a 3 hour movie or mini series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this with the missus. Absolutely awesome premise and delivery but we both felt there was something missing. I would love to read the first screenplay of this if anybody has one. What happened to Sigourney Weaver's newsroom characters? There was huge potential for the news teams and surely the whole idea of the film was about capturing video clips and pictures. This should have been a mini series or even better,time travel willing, should have been the JFK movie Ollie Stone made. There must be hours and hours of unused footage that would have made a far better mini series than this movie turned out. It is plainly obvious that the director had a larger vision for this but in the end looks like he/she bit off more than he/she could chew. Or as always the producers probably turned the tap off before the artistic thirst was quenched. This film could have and quite possibly should have been more like 'The Conversation" rather than 'JFK" meets 'The Transporter' 7 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gimmikcy action thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In terms of entertainment value this hectic assassination thriller just about works, but if you have no patience for the current vogue of toying with narrative chronology, you might find it hard going. Dennis Quaid gives his usual Harrison Ford impersonation as a dedicated secret service agent returning to service after taking a bullet for President William Hurt. Forrest Whitaker is a lonely tourist with an indestructible video camera who captures on film some key events surrounding an assassination attempt on the president during a peace summit, while Sigourney Weaver plays a TV producer and spends the entire film in a production vehicle staring uncomprehendingly at a bank of screens.If someone took out the time to remove all the repeated scenes in this film they would probably find they are left with about twelve minutes of footage. You certainly can't fault director Peter Travis for getting full potential from his money shot, a giant explosion that takes out the building in front of which the President was about to give a speech. We see it about a dozen times. It certainly looks impressive the first time, but repetition breeds contempt, and those rewinds after each character's episode just had me making accelerating 'talking backwards' noises in an increasingly high-pitched voice, much to the annoyance of my partner.Writer Barry Levy attempts to wrong-foot the viewer at every opportunity. Sometimes he succeeds impressively, while at other times the twists just seem to be inserted for the sake of it. There's a terrific climactic car chase that is marred by horrendous chop-chop-chop editing that will make your eyeballs hurt. In amongst all this hyper-kinetic action, however, are some moments that are almost laughably bad. One of the president's kidnappers, disguised as a medic, finds himself diverted from his mission in the foyer of a bomb-blasted hotel by a do-gooder who wants him to help a man with no pulse. This is because he was standing in the foyer when a suicide bomber pulled the pin, but a couple of well-aimed thumps to the chest manage to get the guy's ticker working again leaving the terrorist free to continue with his mission. The same terrorist, who has cold-bloodedly overseen the murder of countless innocent tourists completely derails his entire operation by avoiding a little kid who has run into the road in front of him; the final shot of Dennis Quaid, from the viewpoint of a supine president, looks like it belongs in Hot Shots Part Deux, and Forest Whitaker's last line will have all sane people reaching for the sick bag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically brilliant, decent plot twists, however, a lack of originality and character development ultimately hurts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point is one of those movies that you're either going to love or hate. If you're a fan of movies like "Crash", the "Bourne" series, or any other film with interlocking stories, odds are that you will enjoy Vantage Point. If you have a hard time stretching your mind, have a short attention span, or are totally not a fan of Dennis Quaid or Forest Whitaker, then you probably won't enjoy the film, plain and simple.The plot, despite being very deep and complex, is actually quite simple on the surface. What you've got is the interlocking stories of several people, all of whom play a pivotal role in the assassination attempt on the President of the United States. The film is not without its political views, however, and this is to be expected. What I enjoyed about the complex plot is that it didn't TRY to be complex. It didn't rub itself in my face, and it was easy to keep track of who was who, and what they were doing.The film features some high profile names, however, we need to remember that most of said actors have never done this kind of movie. Only one of the performers actually manages to develop a good character (and of course, it's the best performer, Forest Whitaker), but half of this problem is due to the screenplay, which is obviously going to be more plot and story driven. It's a paradox, because the filmmakers definitely want the viewer to like Dennis Quaid's character the most, yet there's little effort in developing him outside of his professional life. Forest Whitaker, as said earlier, gives the best performance of the movie, and one of the better supporting performances of the year. I really enjoyed him here. Edgar Ramirez was also very admirable, as was Said Taghmaoui. Matthew Fox and Sigourney Weaver both have very little screen time, but aren't bad at all. Fox's character is another that had a lot of potential, but the screenplay lets him down.Pete Travis is the film's director, and I've got to say...the guy knows how to copy other directors. It felt like an episode of "24", with bits of the "Bourne" movies thrown in, along with the feel of "In the Line of Fire". I'm still reserved about him as a director because I saw nothing new from this movie. While the plot twists were good (again, that's the screenplay, not him), and the action was very well done, I couldn't help and think that I had seen it all before in other films. HOWEVER! Despite my complaints, the film is wonderfully edited (Oscar worthy) and has top notch cinematography. It sounds great as well.In short, Vantage Point has all the trademarks of a well made film. Some good people put a lot of dedication into making this movie as seamless as it is. The screenplay is lacking in the character development area, but more than makes up for it in the story. I definitely look forward to more from this wonderful crew.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Pete Travis gives us a pulse-pounding, quick-cut action movie. U.S. President Ashton(William Hurt)is in Spain to address a global summit on terrorism. Just after stepping to the podium in the crowded town square, he is hit by an assassin's bullet and almost immediately the crowd is rocked by a bomb. In the confusion the leader of the "Free World" is kidnapped. Secret Service agent Thomas Barnes(Dennis Quaid),previously wounded taking a bullet for the president, back on duty quickly takes a look at a tourist's(Forest Whitaker)camcorder thinking the shooter can be identified. Sigourney Weaver is a CNN producer, who also has a point of view of the event. The movie you may say unfolds as it "rewinds" the same chaotic minutes from the view of several involved characters. The most exciting sequence happens when Agent Barnes ends up in a thrilling car chase after one of his own, Agent Kent Taylor(Matthew Fox). Quite an amusement park ride of a movie. Others in the cast: Bruce McGill, Ayelet Zurer, Edgar Ramirez, Zoe Saldana and Eduardo Noriega.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Action Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A summit in Spain on global terrorism and there is an assassination, and a bombing. Amid the ensuing confusion, Secret Service Agent Thomas Barnes (Quaid) is hot on the trail of those responsible.This movie could have been titled 12:59AM because you are going to see the assassination, the bombing from the perspective of different people on the scene at the time. When you see one person's take on what happened, the time will go back to 12:59AM for the others whose story you will see - like a Groundhog Day kind of thing. Actually, it's kind of interesting the way it's done and they must have used a million cameras, but they did a good job. Okay, it did get a little annoying seeing almost the same thing over and over again, but you see the same scenes from different Vantage Points. But none of the Vantage Points had anything to do with solving the puzzle as to who was responsible except one. There is very little dialogue in here. What you will see is the assassination, bombing, mass confusion (from the people there to witness the summit ceremony) over and over again, and then the big car chase. And, what a car chase. One of the best I have ever seen. Whatever car Agent Barnes used to pursue the bad guys, I want one. But, most of the movie is the car chase. But what a car chase. Well done. The acting was very good all around. Sigourney Weaver was under-used, but it was nice to see her again. Don't believe CGI was used as the stunts looked too real for that. While all was good and enjoyable and entertaining, they could have done a better job with the ending. It was very weak. Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: Yes, but no F Bombs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Multi-layered action thriller involving the targeting of the President of the United States for assassination by this Morocco based terrorist group known as the Mujahideen Brigade.Within the first five minutes of the film we get to see US President Ashton, William Hurt, about to address an overflow crowd at the Spanish city of Salamanca's main square and get shot twice before even making an opening statement. In the pandemonium that follows with a deafening explosion that kills and injures scores of people Spanish undercover-cop Enrique Countearon, Eduardo Noriaga, who was tackled by top secret services man Thomas Barnes, Dennis Quaid, as a suspect in President Ashton's assassination makes his escape.Even though Officer Countearon had every reason to do what he did in trying to protect Salamanca's mayor De Soto, Jose Carlos Rodriguez, from sharing the same fate as President Ashton he in fact ends up a fugitive from the law chased by both secret service men and fellow Salamanca policemen. It's then that the movie "Vantage Point" goes into rewind and we see the assassination attempt on President Ashton from some five different perspectives including that of the president himself!Reconstructing the five or so different vantage points of President Ashton's assassination attempt we can then piece together the course of events that lead to this tragic incident. The attack on President Ashton was obviously an inside job that was planned and rehearsed in advance dozens of times before it was finally put into action.****SPOILER ALERT**** What turned out to be the assassins undoing wasn't that their plan wasn't perfect but a number of unexpected incidents came into play including their own distrust of themselves. This in the end had the assassins turn on each other which exposed their entire operation making it easy from the secret service and local police to do their job by the assassins doing it for them.It takes a while to fully absorb what's going on in the movie with it's constantly moving back and forth in time. By the time all the different viewpoints and angles of Pesident Ashton's assassination has been presented the movie then turns into a Bullitt-like chase sequence. We have secret serviceman Barnes tearing up the whole town in a hair raising car-chase in order to get those who were responsible in the assassination attempt. That chase sequence was by far, compared to the constant rewinding of the film, the best part of "Vantage Point".There's also Forrest Whitaker as American tourist Howard Lewis who unwittingly films, with his camcorder, the assassin. At first trying to cooperated with the secret service in finding who took a pot shot at their boss, President Ashton, Howard ends up being the hero in the film. Not by him catching those responsible for shooting the president but by saving little Anna, Alicia Zapien, who he befriended after she accidentally soiled his shirt with an ice-cream cone she was eating. It was Anna together with Howard who, by getting in their way, put a final end to the assassins devious plans by, believe it or not, bringing the very best human qualities out of them which at the time seemed to be an almost impossible task.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, it's not as good as SNAKE EYES, but it's very similar in many ways.This is a film that builds heavily on the technique it uses to present the very weak story: by seeing the same thing over and over again, but from different persons points of view.If a more conservative technique had been used, the film had never been done, since the story-line is super-thin and not very interesting. The characters are paper-dolls and leaves the actors nothing to work with.The main character, the Secret Service agent Barnes (Dennis Quaid) has the only (!) back-story in the whole film, and this is just a few seconds video clip.But even though the story and characters are not there, it is still a pretty interesting film. Especially the turning point approx half way through the film is kind of nice, and the ending has enough car-chases, noise and stunts to make the whole thing tie up pretty neatly.It's a small little film that you will forget, but it's cute entertainment for an hour and a half.Good actors (William Hurt, Dennis Quaid, Forest Whitaker), but best is Sigourney Weaver's cameo in first few minutes.Directing is mostly focusing on the (many!) extras, and production value is pretty high and impressive at times.Could've used a few more re-writes and a better location - but it works for what it is.6/10</fullReview>

However, the film's major 'selling point' is that the story is told several times, through the use of different spectators/participants' perspectives (in fact 'Perspective' might have been a more appropriate title!).Therefore, the film-makers can claim it's an original concept applied to a not particularly original idea. And it works... just.For a thriller it ticks all the boxes you want. It has stars (many in fact) who all turn in an acceptable performance (and give them extra credit when none of them are in it ALL the way through, therefore hardly giving them a chance to 'flesh out' their character). It's not that long and there are a good few shoot-outs/explosions/car chases.And that's it really. It could be described as 'run of the mill' if it wasn't for it's different approach to the norm, plus it has just about enough A-list stars in it to raise it above a B-movie. But, at the end of the day, that's basically what it is ? a glorified B-movie. But that's no bad thing, as it's highly watchable and should keep you entertained if you like thrillers for just under an hour and a half.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated for sure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this when it first came out here in the UK back in 2008 and it was a near empty theater, in hindsight this was a good thing as there was no distraction from what I believe is a highly underrated political thriller.From the get go we are drawn into the action from afar, so to speak when we witness the assassination of the US President and a bombing of a peace conference in Spain from the safety of a newscaster truck. But the perspective quickly changes after that when the clock goes back and we get to the middle of the action from the POV of two secret service agents.OK, that's just skimming the surface here but to be honest that's all you need for a blurb dude. This film's selling point is not only its great cast (Dennis Quaid, William Hurt, Matthew Fox and Forest Whitaker are the American sellers here but the whole cast in this. Also Sigourney Weaver makes a special appearance as a Newscaster boss.) but its unique narrative whereby the films plot is gradually told in separate parts, or 'episodes' if you will, from the perspective of the different characters one at a time. Each time the story of one reaches a head, the clock goes back to the start for the next one, revealing new plot points and twists that will leave you on the edge of your seat till the end.Watch this, you gotta give it a chance.FP</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice concept but story too convoluted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The President of the United States Ashton (William Hurt) is in Salamanca, Spain for an international agreement with other world leaders. He is shot as he is about to address a crowd. Then a distant explosion and a bomb goes off in the square. Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver) is the TV producer and reporter Angie Jones (Zoe Saldana) is caught in the explosion. The events are retold through the vantage points of hero Secret Service agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid), local cop Javier (Édgar Ramírez), tourist Howard Lewis (Forest Whitaker), the President, and other characters.I like the basic premise of using different point of views. The movie works well for the first half. Then around midway, the movie gets convoluted. It's one crazy twist after another and one outrageous action scene after another. It's just too much. If the story is that type of action thriller, then the structure needs to be straight forward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From my vantage point, a mesmerizing mystery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a mesmerizing presidential thriller where the U.S. President (William Hurt) was involved in an attempted assassination, and the events surrounding the incident are retold by eight different people with differing viewpoints.A movie where the leader of the country is in trouble generates much tension to the viewers because, I think, it is gripping to see what the aftermath is and the consequences it leads to for the people involved and the country the leader serves. Barry Levy wrote an interesting story that focuses on the different viewpoints of the attempted assassination well, but leaves much cliffhangers until the truth is unveiled at the end of the movie. Pete Travis gave pretty good direction in connecting the different viewpoints within the plot, making the movie easy to follow.The acting was at most average because there wasn't much character development or substance, and some delivered some really campy dialog. This dragged the movie somewhat, but the mystery and action did make up for it. Overall, it's not a bad mystery movie; plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing the outcome until the end.Grade B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vantage Point is a movie that we have all seen before. This movie really offered no surprises but somehow I still was able to enjoy this movie. The enjoyable things about this movie are definitely the cast and the story.This movie is about what the eyes of different people see when the United States President is struck down by an assassin.The acting is really good. The all-star cast led by Dennis Quaid, Signourey Weaver, William Hurt, and Forrest Whittaker all did a fantastic job.The one thing that irritated me is the camera work and how each scene started over again. That was pretty annoying.Overall, this is a good if not great thriller. I would watch it just because of the cast. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And original it was. Well... it's no Memento, but its loops were so much the way they should've been, I can hardly imagine how it would've got a rating less than... at least 7/10 In fact, at moments I caught Dennis Quaid overdoing his rage, which was not much of a letdown, but it was kind of obvious at some point... or at least to me. Besides the plot and its unraveling, I kept a thought of mine throughout the film: Forest Whitaker is EPIC! I've seen him play roles of a total sellout and I saw this sweet African American tourist that just wanted to give nothing less than all of his help to unraveling the situation and leaving as many people unharmed as possible. I don't know if I'm just overreacting, or is it really that he is so damn good, but I enjoyed it so much.I give it 8/10 It's not a movie of great depth, it's not a movie that could turn your whole life upside down, but it's a great thriller, it begins with a good idea, pushes you through its awesome screening, has great cast and keeps you guessing for an hour and a half. Plus it's way more than I expected it to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie effort wasted on a commonplace story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is promising in the summary and trailer, but it doesn't live up to it. I can say its storytelling is somewhat original, but the problem is that they didn't seem to take enough advantage of that idea. The movie tells a story based on different views and informations available to each of the main characters in the movie. Every time they restart telling the events, they let the audience know a little more of what's happening. That gives a lot of potential to a movie, as it may be explored in infinite ways, and tell great stories in a grandiose fashion. Unfortunately, in my opinion, all of that potential was wasted in a pretty common story. So, basically, it's a great storytelling way, wasted on an average story.The movie is well produced. It has good acting, good scenarios, the story is coherent, the film is not boring. It uses an innovative storytelling. With all of that, in the end you just think, "well, that movie was OK". What's wrong then? My answer is: the story. This is a good movie to watch, if you just want to kill some time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very good action film. Intelligent. When you realize this 90 plus minute film covers only about 15 minutes in actual time, you know it's an impressive achievement. A couple of things bothered me: The "double" used to deliver the President's speech should have been another actor; not William Hurt, who played the actual President. It was comical when the news director (Sigourney Weaver) kept prompting the young woman reporter to get up after the explosion because she was obviously dead. At the end, it was ludicrous to believe that the professional, cold hearted terrorist would swerve and crash the ambulance to avoid hitting a little girl - particularly after he had just killed about a hundred innocent people in the bomb blast. Also, for a man past fifty, Dennis Quaid ran like an NFL wideout.Other than the aforementioned gripes, this film was excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film suffers a lot from its bad script and the way the story is told. The flashbacks become quite disturbing after the 2nd time and after a while I was wondering if this is what we are going to see through the whole movie. Back to the script: I certainly did not expect it to be like a documentary but there is only a certain amount suspension of disbelief I can handle - and it is stretched way beyond that here. Are we really expected to believe that the NSA and all the other security forces around the president are so inept to the degree of letting him walk into a square where people can easily smuggle a whole bag of explosives and carry handguns after just waving a phony badge? What about noticing a curtain moving but not seeing an open window with a sniper rifle behind it ? being on the same side of the building? Speaking of which - what was the joke with this James Bond style gadget of a cell phone being capable of aiming the above rifle just like that? At this point I was wondering if this is supposed to be funny but, unfortunately, the film was still taking itself seriously? I don't even want to talk about all the characters only being shown as evil and nothing more: they obviously just hate the USA and its president so who cares about their background and motivation if they are going to die anyway. This one-dimensional approach might work with a C-movie but here it simply adds up to the disappointment. All in all, another proof that great cast can not save a poor story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies that i have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me share my point of view. Its an awesome movie (but you have to be a bit patience though). The best reason i liked the movie is not only because of its way of screenplay(dividing into 6 plots) but also because all the plots sum up and form the base perfectly.The story looks real, it starts with a news channel taking live videos for coverage in Spain where around 150 leaders from various countries have planned to meet for some kinda world peace. Now here's the incident,the US president is being shot and this happens at around 12.23 midday(which is followed by explosions)The sequences of events of 6 individuals are shown one by one and this is the best part because the order of all the sequences are fitted perfectly.If you love thrilling movies then i bet that you wont find it irritating as mentioned by few.But the main track which will be continued from the sixth vantage point is the best part. The president's double was actually shot and the terrorists are having the original one with them(and they are taking him in a van as a hostage)The main agent of the president finds out that his partner too is one among the terrorists. He then starts the cop-thief car chase which is very much enjoyable. There is a kid named Anna who searches for her mother as they were separated during explosions. And there is a photographer who takes videos of all the events.The final scene where the main terrorist looks in front of his van and sees Anna on the verge of accident, turns his van which unfortunately falls and is about to collide her. But the photographer saves her. These scene i liked the most. The acting of Dennis Quaid(agent),Forest Whitaker(photographer),Édgar Ramírez(the man who shot the guards and kidnapped the president because his brother was with the terrorists),Sa?d Taghmaoui(the terrorist) was really awesome.One of my TOP-5 favorites. Go for it guys...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing New Here - Mostly 2nd Rate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point is mostly tiresome - that includes the story, characters, action, and acting/dialog - it's mostly been done before and better. (Spoiler)The movie is purposely repetitive for almost the first half and then becomes sort of a standard chase movie. Problems here besides going over nothing original are some logical questions with a girl just blindly crossing an busy intersection, an overweight older guy supposedly keeping up with sprinting agents and ridiculous security assumptions. Acting is only fair to sub-standard with lots of grunting and expletives taking the place of dialog. The movie feels like it's been written by young teenager. I suppose the stars in the movie are collecting paychecks as for many of them they're there as camios. Also Unfortunately the chase scenes are not focused and unimaginative mostly. So do you like sort of spy-vs-spy semi-action chase genre movies with uneven pacing, a repetitive gimmick employed like a Star Trek episode and some of the problems I disliked? Well, you might give it an OK if so; this isn't really recommendable although it's not horrible either - quite mediocre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way too stretched, but still somewhat entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tag-line promises that we will see 8 different people's perspective of the event - an assassination attempt on the president of the USA. However, this is not what is delivered in the film. We see a somewhat shortened version of the 23 minutes four times, but that's just the first hour.After that, the movie goes on and during the next, continuous hour, shows us "who did it and how". There's extortion, there's betrayal... and there's way too much lucky chance for my taste. To believe that all those lucky moments, which only had few seconds to occur, could actually occur, doesn't work for me. I like stories that don't contain that much "luck".Thinking who did it and what was the role of each person was still quite entertaining, but once again, there's the problem with too many lucky moments or "twists". Worth watching, although "Sentinel" seemed a bit better to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noontime at the plaza</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Vantage Point" directed by Pete Travis is an action movie that tries hard to wow its viewers with a narrative that, at first, seems disorienting. Mr. Travis must have admired other gimmick films that had relied in telling a story from different points of view, depending whose character is being shown on an individual basis. It doesn't help much either that the screen treatment by Barry Levy is not one based on reality. It is one of those far fetched stories that only Hollywood can come up with.To make matters worse, the location of the film was changed from Salamanca, Spain to Puebla and Cuernavaca in Mexico. The proportions of the main plaza where the pivotal event takes place looks wrong and the car chases takes the viewer to South of the border, and not to Spain, as it was intended.Dennis Quaid comes out best with his Thomas Barnes, a tough man that has faced death and has survived. His loyalty to the man he is supposed to defend at all costs is paramount in his mind. Mr. Quaid gives a good performance as a man with nerves of steel. William Hurt, who plays the president, doesn't quite elicit our sympathy. Forest Whitaker has some good moments as the American tourist that stumbles into what turns out to be a nightmare. Poor Sigourney Weaver doesn't have anything to play in the movie.If you are looking for an action-packed film, rent this DVD, as it surely will amuse viewers that will not ask questions about the credibility of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>conventional ending damages an interesting thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Vantage Point' succeeds to trigger the interest of the viewer with a non-conventional approach to a thriller theme that has become quite popular in the last few years. An assassination attempt on the life of the United States president at a peace summit in Europe is being presented from the perspective of the different players in the drama - TV reporters, secret agents, local policemen, innocent spectators and the terrorist themselves. Not only each character brings a different angle and perspective of the events, but the meaning of the story changes permanently and there are some good surprises hidden and revealed at the right time. It is however the ending that spoils the whole show. After all the careful build-up in the first hour of screening the last 20 or 30 minutes converge to a very conventional and rhetoric ending which would have not shamed a Ronald Reagan (the actor) film of the 50s, but shames the logic because of the too many coincidences that suddenly, in the absence of the surprises become too evident. A remarkable team of actors delivers what is expected from them. It's really a pity that the inspiration of the screen writers seems to have completely evaporated by the end, the film creates until then some high expectations, and the disappointment is up to them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exciting Movie Told In An Interesting Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I approached this cautiously, thinking that it might quickly become boring. How interesting can it be, I thought, to watch essentially the same story eight times - even if it's being told from the perspective of various characters. Actually, this turned out to be a very interesting mystery/suspense/thriller/action type movie that was at times very exciting. The story revolves around an assassination attempt against the U.S President (William Hurt) in Spain. The point of the movie is to figure out who shot the President and why. Dennis Quaid, as Secret Service agent Thomas Barnes, is the central character here. Barnes is just back on the job after having saved the President from a previous assassination attempt. He's still a bit shaky, having taken the bullet, and his colleagues aren't at all sure they can trust him. We also get the story from seven others, the best known actors being Forrest Whittaker as a tourist who happened to be taking video of the President's visit, and Sigourney Weaver as a TV news producer covering the visit. Each successive version of the events adds something a little new to the story for the viewer and it really never does get tiresome watching the different "vantage points." One criticism I might make seems typical of American made movies which often seem to forget the concept of jurisdiction. While the Secret Service does certainly protect the President even in foreign countries, I seriously doubt that in a foreign country the Secret Service would have the authority to act like a police force, chasing down suspects and shooting at them through crowds of people while doing so. (Although this did allow us to watch a really excellent car chase!) Would it not be the local police attending to that? Still, I thoroughly enjoyed this very exciting movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting enough piece if you don't mind loads of coincidences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Give or take an outrageous coincidence or five, Vantage Point isn't half bad. In many ways it shares the strengths of a cartoon in which you are given the bare essentials of a situation, just enough to make it intelligible and to convey with economy what is intended to be conveyed. The conceit of watching the same incident from multiple perspectives is neatly done and as chase scenes go (I'm not a big fan of chase scenes because they rarely make sense), the chase which concludes Vantage Point is middling to good although yet again the amount of coincidences is, not to put too fine a point on it, very cheeky. In fact if it weren't for various coincidences, there would be no story. Actually, there is no story to speak of, no characterisation, no background, nothing really except the ongoing mystery of what is going on. But then you don't go to McDonald's for French cuisine, and at heart Vantage Point is an honest film in that it doesn't promise more than it delivers and what it delivers is entertaining enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a town square in Salamanca, Spain, during a public address, the American President (William Hurt), is assassinated. In the ensuing furor, two bombs explode...And we roll our eyes: coulda seen that coming - the president was launching an initiative on counter-terrorism.VANTAGE POINT relates the tales of various players and onlookers in this incident and how they figure in piecing together what happened and whose little red wagon needs to be fixed.Like a mini-RASHOMON, VANTAGE POINT reverses every ten minutes and starts the story again from another person's Point Of View, revealing a tad more of the overall gag.First, it is the American Tourist with de rigeur vidcam Point Of View (Forest Whitaker, doing his characteristic Big Dumb Galoot); then it is the television news producer's P.O.V. (Sigourney Weaver); then the Secret Service Guy Who Took a Bullet for The Big Guy Last Year (Dennis Quaid in Constant Trepidation Mode); then it's the Euro Femme Fatale's Point Of View (Ayelet Zurer), intrigue following her through the crowd like men's eyes following her ass cheeks... as each piece fits into the puzzle, it all starts adding up to a steaming pile of ambivalence.There is a subplot about a kidnapped brother, a traitorous Secret Service guy, a great car chase through crowded Spanish streets (with no one getting hurt in this Bizarro World - I say, make the chase scene pop by hitting people out of the way like dolls); and there's even a presidential bait and switch.VANTAGE POINT is one of those films where the misdirection makes it seem like the film has direction. Oh, it's well-directed by Pete Travis and the story lines are solidly intertwined by first-time writer, Barry Levy, but it falters when the president is revealed merely watching his double get shot from a vantage point (cha-ching!) in a nearby building. Hey! No fair! When I see the president get shot, I want it to be the real guy! I guess that's just MY Point Of View.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What could possibly go wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you turn your brain off, this is an intriguing little thriller that builds suspense by keeping you guessing, with a high-adrenaline chase at the end. As soon as your brain kicks in, though, you'll be wondering about the following plot points (spoilers galore): 1. Terrorists entrust the most critical part of their incredibly complex scheme to an outsider they've blackmailed into it by holding his brother hostage. Considering all that they're asking the guy to do, this seems a little far-fetched, when there's no reason one of their own team couldn't do this themselves, unless they just plain ran out of terrorists. Maybe they could have used the TV cameraman who's also one of their moles, since his role doesn't seem that critical.(As long as we're at it: Let's kill the hostage before our plan is executed!) 2. On the other hand, there is a good reason for the female terrorist to romance a local cop: Because they assume he can get her bag through security when she asks him to bring it for her. Of course, this asks us to believe that the cop never notices that his girlfriend (I assume) is consorting with terrorists, even though he seems almost insanely jealous when he does spot her talking to some dude in the plaza (another problem with involving the random guy from point #1). Also, he'll never peek inside her bag or notice that he's carrying a bag full of explosives.3. No one in the Secret Service ever notices that one of the president's men is colluding with the terrorists in an incredibly complex plan which will require his involvement to the point of abandoning his duties and switching clothes to play a major role in their getaway, so we can assume they had to be in fairly regular contact. (On the other hand, we in the audience start to smell something fishy about him as soon as the plan starts going down.) Assuming in the first place that a terrorist mole could infiltrate the Secret Service and be assigned to the president's detail, since we never really get to know what turned the agent, if he was in fact a loyal servant from the start. This is the kind of plot device that always makes a lot more sense in the scriptwriter's mind than in the discerning viewer's.4. A lone gunman can always take out the president's entire secret service detail, except for the guys who run down the stairs without noticing one of their colleagues has just been shot one landing up.5. Even distracted as they are by the news and an explosion downstairs, you might expect the president and his aides to be alarmed by a gun battle breaking out in the hallway outside their room.6. Several times during the car chase Dennis Quaid's car seems to encounter obstacles that would translate into a wreck with serious damage, yet it emerges unscathed each time until it's finally sidelined by an 18-wheeler.Unlike some other posters, the bad guys swerving to avoid hitting a little girl in the middle of the street didn't faze me as much, perhaps because it might just be an instinctive move, perhaps because if you've ever actually hit someone with your vehicle, you'd know it could do serious damage to your vehicle, perhaps even to the point of disabling it.I'll still give it a five for keeping me intrigued about what was really going on (I kept waiting for them to explain the off-stage explosion that turns everyone's heads), then really annoying me when the big reveal proved the plot behind the gimmick was full of holes.</fullReview>

You're left asking, "Why should I care about the characters?" No method for the audience to identify with the characters is made. Seeing the same scene from different view points is forced and actually lacks suspense. You know that feeling that you get when you beat other people in the board game Clue? Well, you don't get that feeling here,even though it seems the director intended you to.

I do not want to compare this with Roshomon which is of a different genre. I am going to talk about only one scene the last car crash and finale. Human minds are very complex. A man can ruthlessly kill anybody and everybody who is not concerned with his plot but suddenly when the driver sees a child in front of speeding car he tries to avoid her and that is the end of him. I was reminded of the book ( and a film) "The Eagles have Landed" by Jack Higgins. It is not clear what is the grievance of one of the conspirators and I have to see the film again to find out. I also feel the car chase in a crowded narrow streets is rather not natural All in all surprisingly a very good film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say this movie is action packed and really entertaining. The cast is quite impressive - Dennis Quaid, Matthew Fox, Forest Whittaker, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver! The acting isn't great but no one stands out as being unusually bad either. It's shot nicely so visually it's a pretty pleasant experience.Once you notice the gaping plot holes or try to make sense of it, you may be a bit disappointed. This is definitely an action movie that requires not only suspension of disbelief but also a departure from intelligence. Just accept that there are good guys fighting bad guys and lots of stuff blows up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great idea for a film. Eight different "vantage points" to a presidential assassination, all flawlessly matched and overlapped, each adding a new twist and a new surprise to a complex plot. The tension builds and builds with no let-up, emphasized by fast cuts and busy camera work. Normally this sort of tense action is relieved by a romantic or even a comic interlude. Not here. It drives on relentlessly. But it still works. Plan to spend a good number of the 90 minutes on the edge of your seat. I was very surprised to see that most of the film had been shot in Mexico, not Spain. As somebody familiar with both countries, you fooled me. I already had decided on a 9 vote when it started. I was about to boost it to a ten. But then the car chases started. Too many. Too long. Too hard to believe. They really cheapen what until that point is a very classy film. Bottom line? I still enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow start, but exciting finale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read some of other reviews here and am amazed that A LOT OF people give this movie just 1 star, even though they still have many positive remarks concerning this movie. It's like they only give 10 starts or just 1, depending on whether they liked the movie or not.I have watched this movie yesterday and while it's not that terrific to earn 10 points, it's not a complete disaster either. In my opinion, this movie deserves a solid 7.5, though I rounded it up to 8, as I had to choose between 7 or 8 stars.The movie has an interesting viewpoint as to how to tell a story, which reminds me a bit of 'Memento' and 'Pulp Fiction'. At a convention (against terrorism, how cliché), the US president is shot, you hear 1 distant explosion (later in the movie you see where that was), followed by another one shortly after, killing hundreds of people.The movie shows 5 different viewpoints of the circumstances of this event and ends with a 6th viewpoint, where the viewpoints of some remaining characters are combined. Each viewpoint takes you a bit further in time for a 'cliffhanger' effect.The first viewpoint is more like an introduction. The second, third and fourth viewpoint have a lot of similarities. The second viewpoint is OK (of Dennis Quaid's Character), but the third and fourth hardly provide you with extra information. You practically see the same scenes, but with different camera stances. This becomes a bit dull. At the fifth viewpoint (of the President) the movie becomes interesting again as most of the scenes are NOT located at the plaza or in the streets so that you won't have to see the same scenes all over again. The sixth viewpoint (or rather combination of the remaining 'bad-guys' viewpoints) is a 15-20 minute thrill ride, with a great car chase scene, some nice 'SAS-style' shootouts, and of course revelation of the missing pieces of the puzzle.Some scenes have deliberately been shot twice, to add an other atmosphere to the scene. As an example, you see a couple standing close to each other as if they have just kissed each other goodbye, later in the movie you see that this couple was not at all friendly towards each other. In fact they were more like threatening each other. As this scene is shot the first 2 times from the perspective of the 'jealous boyfriend' and the 'heart-broken tourist', the interpretation of this 'smooching' is a bit colored and this couple looks more friendly. The third time you'll see the same scene through the eyes of the man from this couple and see that he is blackmailed by the woman.Everything depends on the Eye of the Beholder, which makes the slight changes in the scenes rather interesting.Weak points in this movie: - Slow start, because of several semi-identical scenes, which don't tell you anything you don't know yet, the movie becomes a bit repetitive/boring in the beginning. (-2) - Because of cutting, the time-frame between events is not always the same (before the shooting, between shooting and first bombing, between first bombing and second bombing). According to some viewpoints there seem like only a few seconds between the two viewpoints, while according to other viewpoints the time-frame between these bombings seems much longer. (-0) - Most characters start with a blank sheet. It takes a while before several characters get a bit more depth. However this was necessary so that you wouldn't know which one is a good guy and which one isn't. (-0,5) - Some characters don't get any depth at all (-1) - Too many viewpoints, or better: some viewpoints don't add much to what you already know. (-1)Strong points: - The 'Eye of the Beholder' style of changes in the scenes are interesting (what seems to be a kiss in the cheek to one, is a threatening whisper to an other) (+0,5) - The finale (last 20 minutes) is great! (+3) - Viewpoints 1, 2 and 5 are also interesting (+1) - some interesting plot changes, but it never gets far-fetched or difficult to follow. I like puzzles in stories :) (+1) - Aside from the 30 minutes where the movie gets slightly boring, you really get taken away in the 'whodunnit'-plot. (+0,5)All in all, this movie is a nice action-packed thriller. It's not that great to make it phenomenal and make it worth 8+ stars, normally, but it deserves more than an 'average' 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vantage Point to its credit is a taut, tense thriller. Although it is able to entertain for the duration of its running time it fails to deliver on a more sophisticated level.The concept of Vantage Point, seeing events from different character perspectives, although not novel is a refreshing change. The editing is crisp and sharp and the initial storyline has potential.The problem with Vantage Point is that the main character, Dennis Quaid, who is very good, is a stereotypical character and the supporting cast are very much the same. Together with some implausible moments and the ability to guess rather easily who will be the 'good' and who will be the 'bad' guy nullifies its entertainment value.Vantage Point is certainly worth a watch for it is an enjoyable, even exciting at times experience. However, its a real shame that it lacks depth both in plot and character and this leaves you with a sense of dissatisfaction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Distracting due to its pace but ultimately quite unsatisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At a political summit in Spain, the US President is to make a public appearance. Obviously the crowds pack in while the media swarms around with the secret service trying to keep everything tight and controlled. However a single shot marks an assassination attempt, with at least one bomb following it up. Within seconds what was calm is now chaos and with evidence and suspects thinning by the second, Agent Thomas Barnes has to try and work out what just happened based on what he saw ? but the full story will only come from the actions and views of several of those involved.Like others have already said, this sounds like a great idea that should produce a mystery and action and, for a short period of time it IS a good film. The problem is that the gimmick of "points of view" isn't really that well delivered and in fact it isn't really true because it is not so much about people's memories or impressions of the event but more just we see the parts that each play in it at different times. So basically we have lots of characters involved and in turn we see what each of them did separately before later seeing how they come together ? sounds like every other narrative structure to me. Except it isn't, it is just different enough to make you think that you are watching something fresh and new, whether it works or not. The thing is that it doesn't work in the way many viewers will want, even if it does work in regards the aims of the makers. You see, the gimmick of skipping back and forward in time doesn't really do anything of value narratively but it does provide yet more movement and "movement" is the thing that just about keeps this film afloat.Short and full of action, the film has a lot going on and will convince some that it is exciting and gripping. Others will see it for what it is, which is noise without a lot of substance and, like me, will perhaps find it easy to watch but, at the end, will be surprised by how little they care or remember about the film. I'm not convinced that Pete Travis was the best man for the job ? not that he did badly but just that he is not an action director (looking at his resume) and this film needs someone who can do the Hollywood slick movement with ease ? perhaps they thought he would effortlessly just be another Greengrass? The cast is better than the material deserves and, no matter how superficial the story or wasted the stars, at least they all try. Quaid enjoys his leading man role again and he does make a solid, grizzled action hero of sorts, even if his car chase is not that exciting or convincing. Fox is reasonably good but with this and Speed Racer I'm yet to see anything to really convince me that he can make the jump from Lost. Not entirely sure what attracted Whitaker but I suppose this is an "easy" piece for him after a few years of strong performances in Last King of Scotland and The Shield. Hurt, Weaver, McGill, Ramirez ? hell, even Jones, are all reasonably wasted with very little to actually do ? Weaver in particular must have turned up on set for little more than two days.Vantage Point is a fairly basic thriller that doesn't really do a great job of thrilling or satisfying. For 90 minutes though it uses its gimmick and its pace to carry it as fast as it can and, in this way, it distracts for that running time even if it never really engages or is satisfying as a product.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. I felt like I was watching Groundhog Day all over again. It was like my DVD player was stuck on rewind. I almost fell asleep after the 3rd replay of the first 10 or so minutes of the movie. Looked over and my husband WAS sleeping. I liked the beginning and I liked the ending, but the incessant recurring flashbacks were just plain irritating after the first 2. Dennis Quaid was excellent and it was good to see Matthew Fox in something other than Lost. The cast was top notch and the story was actually very good. It reminded me of a 2 hour version of 24. This movie had so much potential. I understand that The Powers That Be are looking for new angles on old stories, but don't fix what ain't broke. If you must watch it, wait for it to play on a movie channel you already pay for - don't fork out the extra bucks to rent it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an absolute mess of a movie. The idea is interesting, although not original: tell one story from multiple perspectives and let the audience piece it together. The problem is that Vantage Point wants to marry the slick action of Bourne Identity with the intriguing complexity of Rashomon. This might be possible, but Vantage Point certainly doesn't pull it off. In fact, this movie really misses the point of multi-perspective storytelling. The point is that there is no truth, only versions of the truth. Instead of exploring this idea, as Rashomon did, Vantage Point uses multiple perspectives as a cheap device to string together plot points until it tires of the exercise and leads the audience to the inevitable conclusion in which everything is tied up nice and neat. The quick-cut editing that is so popular right now only makes things worse, since the audience isn't given a chance to dwell on the varying perspectives to sort out their differences. As a result, the audience is not presented with a complex situation and asked which perspective they believe, rather they are dragged through the streets of Spain and constantly asked "Did you see that?!?!?" Someone should tell the filmmakers that we're better than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious Movie / Asinine Plot (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point really was a pain in the butt to sit through. That's not to say that the movie doesn't deliver action; but it delivers the same action sequence over and over. By the fourth "turnback," I was groaning and crowing like an old man. Vantage Point asks a lot of its audience, and fails to keep attention long enough to fulfill the promise of a good ending for all of the waiting. The ending was an obvious Deux ex Machina. It wasn't even close. Of course, the little girl just happens to run right in front of that ambulance, which crashes right in front of Dennis Quaid. In fact, the last half of this movie was completely rubbish. Matthew Fox was annoying and terrible, and Forrest Whitaker was held back by the poor script. There was some talent in this movie, but the script didn't allow it to shine. The plot was also completely ludicrous. First, the President gets assassinated; but no, it's not the President. It's a double! Then, a Super-Commando breaks into the President's hotel, and takes him hostage. Now, why would they have needed to pull off the first terrorist attack if this was the master plan? Terrible. Terrible. This script is porous and asinine as can be. Now, why on earth, if there is a plot on the President's life, would he be in a hotel right next to where the attack is supposed to take place, with a light secret service presence? Nothing about this movie makes sense. Nothing. I am all for suspending my belief, but this is off the deep end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vantage Point - Concept Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That is the last time I pay attention to reviews! I had the opportunity to go and see Vantage Point when it came out in cinemas, but due to the many negative reviews - mostly quoting "the constant rewind will drive you mad", "it gets on your nerves", "plot has no logic" - I decided not to bother. I waited until it came out on DVD and rented it.I love anything that breaks the mould; any film that can tell a good story in a new, interesting and engaging way. Vantage Point achieved all this with style.It gets straight to the point, there is no time wasted creating back stories to all of the characters. The film credits the audience with some respect and common sense as you learn all you need to know about the characters as the film develops. The film rattles along at a tremendous pace which never diminishes and concludes just short of 90 minutes. I can't remember the last film I saw which ran at a suitable length! Most action/adventure/thrillers nowadays tend to run somewhere between 2 and 3 hours and are not nearly as engaging as Vantage Point.I love the whole "point of view" concept. I can't believe the number of comments which describe viewers' frustration of this style of story telling. It was completely engaging, unique and stylish.</fullReview>

But I don't know, there's something about it that it lacks. It maybe get a little boring, specially when you realize that you'll have to wait and see the same thing 7 times before the great persecution (this part was great) I think this movie is for the patient people, but it is a good film about the terrorism against the nations and all of that, it's just need it a little more, and it would had been a great movie.

		<shortDescription>Its Individual Stories Require a Critical Analysis...Highly Recommended!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My understanding of the Rashomon narrative style is that it is supposed to be an exploration of different perspectives, or points of view, to arrive at some kind of truth. There must be honesty, to arrive at some kind of truth, in order to maintain a story's integrity. This movies tag line is (about) 8 strangers, (with) 8 points of view, (to arrive at) 1 truth. But, honesty must be an integral part of a storyteller's view, or vantage point, in order to arrive at some kind of truth. Otherwise, the view or vantage point may become biased and distorted, and such blurs or variations will fail to maintain a story's accuracy and integrity. If one variable is deleted, or overlooked, this will adversely affect a story's outcome, and will separate fact from fiction. If a story is supposed to be based on fact, but becomes fictionalized because of inaccuracy, a story will lose its integrity because it is not grounded or rooted in honesty and truth. For a storyteller to be grounded, or rooted, he or she must be clear and focused. One blur, or variation (especially if an omission is very significant enough), can adversely affect the outcome and a storyteller's credibility, reliability, and validity. In such cases, a story's allegations (especially when they are based on circumstantial evidence) can be disputed for being less than accurate. And, even when concrete evidence is provided, a story can be disputed if significant evidence is omitted or overlooked.In "Vantage Point" (2008), there are 8 perspectives that are adversely affected by significant events or variables that do change the story's outcome, such as: the shooting, the bombing, the chaos, the flight and pursuit of perpetrators, circumstances involving the president, etcetera. There are complexities in each of the stories that can easily allow very significant facts to be changed, omitted or overlooked. When such circumstances or events arise (such as in the case of President John F. Kennedy's assassination), inconsistencies can be found in various points of view or perspectives, which can affect a story's accuracy and outcome. And, when there are enough disparities, it is not at all unusual for a story to become confused, garbled, and unresolved. A story may become complex because there are just too many known and unknown variables and, in a poetic sense, its truth(s) may never see the light of day or night.This film arrives at the point of excellence and, because the film is honest about the adverse effects of chaos and tension, I rate it a 10 out of 10. Its individual stories are complex, and such complexity causes confusion, which makes a story's case difficult (if not impossible) to solve. "Vantage Point" (2008) is highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Implausible, But Moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A novel approach to storytelling using multiple angles and perspectives. Similar to Memento in that the linear continuity is altered by the use of several "flashbacks" (rewinds and new storyline branches, actually).However, throughout the entire movie I was jarred by implausibilities that ruined the plot's believability, and I never felt the total sense of immersion in the story. Mostly due to camera angles that were clearly used to move the plot along and not what might actually occur in reality. In one instance a reporter is caught up in an explosion, and the camera remains trained on her (from different zoom settings, too) after the cameraman has supposedly been hit too. Who's changing the shot? I can suspend my disbelief, but not when have to I stop and ask questions mid-way.Clearly this movie is a contrivance fabricated to get the viewer to the end. Everything is SO manipulated in order to tie things up, that I can almost hear the producer &amp; director going, "yeah, I know that seems phony, but I think it will work."! And "work" it does. The pace is riveting and the filming excellent. Just the plot has numerous "leaps of faith" that rankled my intellect throughout.I won't even delve into the mindset of the "terroristas", as it seems irrelevant to the forward momentum. Just accept that the bad guys want to get the good guys. (Us, presumably, due to William Hurts' pre-kidnap pronouncement.) The president is illuminated with such glowing light during this scene, that one expects a halo to appear. Garsh! He's too nice to get hurt.All-in-all, fast-paced, moderately thrilling and obviously well thought-out. Just not riveting. A Hollywood dream-sequence where everything falls in to place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vantage Point is an ingenious action thriller surrounding the attempted assassination of the U.S. President attending an international conference in Spain. The movie is actually 'about" 15 minutes but is seen from the "vantage point' (sorry) of about nine different people. Each perspective presents a tad more about the swirling espionage associated with the conference until you realize that nothing is what you thought it was (AT ALL)in the beginning.Perhaps I am not sophisticated enough to dwell on the supposed GLARING shortcomings of the film. I suspect some "critics" are forced to be oh so discerning that they miss basic elements - this was a thrilling, action-packed, and rather clever way of looking at an intense incident and is an excellent example of the age-old adage that truth is relative. Nine people can look at exactly the same thing and see nine different things.Fun movie. Great action flick. I indeed recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Initially Thrilling But Ultimately Ludicrous Melding of "Rashomon" and "24"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no argument that first-time feature director Pete Travis maneuvers this 2008 action thriller with propulsive intensity throughout its surprisingly fleet ninety-minute running time, but contrivance and coincidence seem to be the two guiding forces behind the overly tricked-out screenplay by first-time screenwriter Barry L. Levy. The concept starts promisingly as it aspires to be a contemporary take on "Rashomon", Akira Kurosawa's classic melodrama about the subjectivity of truth and the uncertainty of factual accuracy. Under the guise of a political thriller, however, the film only replicates one part of Kurosawa's cinematic equation - showing the multiple perspectives of the participants to a traumatic event - without really addressing the complexity behind the individual perceptions. The basis of the differences in perspective lies wholly within the facts to which each participant is exposed. Consequently, Travis and Levy use the recycling gimmick to peel away components of the central assassination plot until we are left with a straight-ahead finale that is as ludicrous as it is chaotic.As just seen in Jieho Lee's even more preposterous "The Air I Breathe", Paul Haggis' "Crash" has inspired yet another overly connected storyline that sacrifices any sense of realism for "24"-style cliffhanger plot devices. This time, the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca, Spain is the setting for an anti-terrorism summit among 150 world leaders at which U.S. President Henry Ashton is about to speak onstage. He is shot twice after which there is an explosion some distance away from the square, and then a few minutes later, a bomb explodes under the stage causing several casualties. This all occurs over a twenty-three-minute period, and it is first seen most effectively through the eyes of a CNN-type news crew led by veteran news producer Rex Brooks. Their viewpoint ends when their onsite reporter is killed in the bombing. The movie is strong in a pulpy way up to this point, but then we see the same series of events six times over. The second perspective shows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes and Kent Taylor on active duty. Just back after recovering from a nervous breakdown brought on by another presidential assassination attempt a year earlier, Barnes is especially anxiety-driven during the events that unfold.The third viewpoint is that of a Spanish police officer named Enrique who may or may not have a connection to the terrorists involved. By the time we see the same events a fourth time, the novelty has genuinely worn off as we see everything again from American tourist Howard Lewis' perspective and then once again from the President himself. These particular episodes spin into an incredulous series of circumstances that lead to the final viewpoint represented by the terrorists themselves. The plot finally moves forward in time once we are privy to what all the participants experience. Performances prove to be secondary in a labyrinth thriller like this, although Dennis Quaid registers the most as the tortured and heroically persistent Barnes, and William Hurt shows true executive élan in the surprisingly meaty role of Ashton. Forest Whitaker valiantly attempts to make the most of a no-win role as Lewis as his character becomes more far-fetched. A similar problem befalls Matthew Fox as Taylor, but Sigourney Weaver has no problem acting authoritative in a near-cameo as Brooks during the best ten minutes of the movie.An international supporting cast fills the remaining key roles expertly - Spain's Eduardo Noriega, Venezuela's Édgar Ramirez, France's Sa?d Taghmaoui (Amir's driver in "The Kite Runner"), and Israel's Ayelet Zurer (Avner's wife in "Munich"). Interestingly, while the plot could have been fodder for an anti-Bush political diatribe, the film holds back from such easy targets. The downside, however, is a murkiness in character motivation that is never really clarified beyond the basic good-versus-bad dynamics. Features on the 2008 DVD are pretty standard with Travis going solo on the film's commentary track. While he provides insight, interactive dialogue with Levy or some of the principal cast could have held more interest. The making-of featurette, "An Inside Perspective" runs nearly a half-hour and provides the standard back-slapping from cast and crew as well as behind-the-scenes footage. The sixteen-minute "Plotting an Assassination" seems repetitive even with the focus purely on the script and the characters. The seven-minute "Coordinating Chaos" focuses on the elaborate stunts, especially the "Bullitt"-style car chase that was filmed in Mexico City doubling for Salamanca. A one-minute gag take (not that funny) and several trailers complete the extras.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>VP is not only a pretty badly-written movie, but it is outright insulting at some points. It's one thing to play loose with plausibility when you have giant, transforming robots coming to do battle on earth. It's another thing entirely to make a film about an actual agency that has some real-world experience in protecting VIPs (even though they are not always successful in their mission) and throw both common-sense and actual operating procedures to the wind. The writers clearly knew nothing much about the presidential detail, or, more likely, they DO know something (or got advisors to tell them) and they simply decided that you, the viewer, is an idiot.Have you ever noticed how many films start out depicting a "crack" unit of elite military operatives, but when the unit is actually sent on a mission, they end up being depicted as cowardly, whining brats who fight more amongst themselves than against the enemy? That's exactly the tone that VP adopts. Nobody (including the terrorist enemy) acts professionally, intelligently, or rationally in this movie. (Well, I take that back. For a change, the President of the US is actually depicted as the smartest and coolest of the bunch.) To add insult to injury, watch the special features on the DVD. All the actors sit around cooing about how marvelous and intricate the script is and how realistically everything is portrayed. One of them even rambles about how "none of the characters is truly evil" in the film...as if kidnapping a guy's brother to extort him to commit murder, then murdering the brother in cold blood, is somehow not evil.VP is only one of a multitude of films patterned after "Rashomon". If it had one-third of the intelligence of "Rashomon", I might have enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploiting good acting talent while boring the audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those types of movies where the audience is expected to be of such low mental capacity that the characters on screen must explain everything that happens in very explicit and plain English. Even if, as is the case here, the plot is so simple and poorly constructed that it makes Mickey Mouse seem like Shakespeare. The dialog is bordering on examples like, »Look, I've brought you a cup of coffee. It's in my hand. You'll notice a white container. That is the cup. Inside the cup is a brown hot liquid which is the coffee. The hand, in case you're wondering, is the slightly hairy crab-like thing attached to my arm. You can't see my arm, as I'm wearing a Secret Service uniform, so look instead at the one end of the long dark blue tube-like thing that is attached to my torso at the other end and covered by a cringe-free fabric. My torso is below my face. By the way, I'm Thomas. We've been colleagues for a while. What is your name? Where are we?« And with dialogue like this, the whole vaguely intriguing (yet not new) idea of letting the viewer experience an interesting scenario such as the assassination of a president through many different characters' eyes, becomes completely pointless, not to say immensely boring. What would be a splendid opportunity to explore different points of views, feelings, backgrounds, etc. for a good script writer, in this case becomes painfully long scenes of watching various characters revealing nothing of genuineness or interest of themselves, thus rendering the entire construction completely moot.The terrible script work is painfully painted on the blank, distant, and/or frustrated faces of pretty much every actor, except for those capable of falling back on some decent character acting, such as Matt Fox's eternal »I don't wanna be here, are we done shooting yet?«-look, Dennis Quaid's »I'll give you a dollar if you can guess what I'm clenching between my teeth«-look, and Forest Whitaker's always safe bet, the »just-a-bit emotionally unstable guy with a boyish wondering charm but the ability to step up when needed« routine.Only after the action kicks in at about half the run-time are we free of the feeling of every camera shift being just instants after the clacking sound of the director's board, with the room still vaguely echoing and ringing after him uttering, »You, say 'but we have to act now, Mr. President' to that guy!« Every facial expression reveals either »Oh yeah, I have to say this now« or »My, how can I say this without sounding dumb?« Basically, it's a terrible, terrible experience to watch. The two is for some of the acting (in spite), and... Well, I can't think of another thing, but I've seen worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "POINT" Is...It Doesn't Really Have One...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine, if you will, that a season of Fox's long-running hit series "24" had only two episodes. To make it even worse, let's suppose those two episodes were the premiere and the finale. Nothing else in between, just the beginning and the end. Frustrating, isn't it? As a matter of fact, you probably wouldn't want to watch the show ever again. Therein lies the problem with VANTAGE POINT, from the same production team that gave you TRU CALLING and PRISON BREAK. Only instead of "24", it's more like "23" - as in the number of minutes the main gimmick uses to lay out the storyline...SEVERAL DIFFERENT TIMES.American president William Hurt is in Madrid, Spain, at an anti-terrorism summit to advance the mandate he's spearheaded with several other countries - to put an end to terrorist activities on a global scale. If you've seen the previews (and they were shown quite often when this film came out), you know that the President is assassinated. Or at least it LOOKS that way. The remainder of the film is spent re-playing the same 23-minute period when this violent act takes place, but from the points of view of several different characters: the President's chief bodyguard (Dennis Quaid); the news director (Sigourney Weaver) who is overseeing the live feed of the conference; an American tourist (Forest Whitaker) looking for a little excitement, who definitely gets more than he bargained for; the bodyguard for the mayor of Madrid (Eduardo Noriega), who knows there's a lot more to this than meets the eye, plus several other interested parties whose role in the chaotic events becomes clearer with each different flashback. Okay, so admittedly, the idea is certainly a neat hat-trick. If you're going to put the audience through a combination of DAY OF THE JACKAL meets GROUNDHOG DAY, you'd better make damn sure that they're riveted and entertained in the process, and VANTAGE POINT certainly does achieve that goal. But here's the problem I had with it, and the reason why a movie like this will never give the producers of 24 any sleepless nights...there is no "WHY."As other reviewers have stated, the intention here was never to provide the audience with any motivation behind the reasons why the "bad guys" in this film do the things they do. For that matter, with the exception of Quaid's and Hurt's characters, the good guys don't seem to have a whole lot of substance either. And Matthew Fox's role as Quaid's loyal buddy and wing man in the President's security cadre, seems to have been cast only to exploit the neat idea of having LOST'S clean-cut heroic hunk play against type, as someone who it turns out is anything but heroic. But that strategy takes all the starch out of the movie for me, because as someone who likes the details of "thinking-man's" thrillers like THE BOURNE SERIES and the Jack Ryan films, if you offer no motivation for "the evil that men do", it turns everyone into nothing more than stereotypical shoot-'em-up cyphers; cartoon characters that might as well not even have names. I mean, they even have "The Trained Military Assassin Working With Terrorists To Save His Brother's Life" (Edgar Ramirez) and "The Lead Terrorist Who Wants All Americans To Die Like Dogs" (Said Taghmaoui). And from every indication, the actors in these roles are much better than the material they were given to work with. This is why '24' works and VANTAGE POINT doesn't. The reasons range from chillingly psychotic to fantastically lame, but all of '24's' baddies had a MOTIVE for their actions. One of the most glaring glitches in the script, BTW, involves a villain who does something that runs completely counter to the actions he takes through most of the movie...which is to kill anyone who hampers the completion of their mission without so much as blinking. Watch for it during the big climax, and you'll see what I mean.So one of my two biggest beefs with VANTAGE POINT is lack of back-story. Sure, it would've taken away from the film's break-neck pacing if they'd had it, but it would've enhanced the concern I felt for the "heroes", and made me invest more in their efforts to stop the villains, who would've been more interesting - and seemed more evil - by default.The second pet peeve is that they have three top notch actors in the cast - Hurt, Weaver and Whitaker - and then they don't have them interact at any time. I know, I know...the script wasn't written in a way that would've allowed for it. But C'MON! Isn't this just the second film where Hurt and Weaver have shared billing since THE VILLAGE in 2004? (1981's EYEWITNESS was their first film together.) And I am one of a VERY few fans of that film. You couldn't even throw us a friggin' bone here and have them meet somehow before the gazpacho hit the fan? ??Well, to sum it up, if you're not a big fan of back-story and just want to see things blown up, cars crashing and bodies riddled with bullets at frequent intervals, VANTAGE POINT will be right up your alley. I thought it was done well, but I'm disappointed that everyone involved only settled for "good" when it could've been "great."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How many times do we have to see the SAME THING?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have been better. Cast is great, and that is usually a bit of a warning for me. Anything with a cast this deep, might be trying to compensate for something. After all, not every movie can be The Departed, right? That said, the story in this is interesting. Presidential assassination viewed from 8 very different "vantage points". Get it? Really cool idea that gets a little tiring after you watch the same sequence of events half a dozen times. Once or twice, maybe even three times would have been acceptable, but after so many rewinds, you start to wonder if the movie is really going anywhere. Granted, you do get another little tidbit of the story with each "rewind", but it's like a bully dangling your lunch money just out of your reach and only dropping nickel every so often. Not sure what they could have done differently. I know they were probably trying to do something new and fresh to separate it from the rest of the kill-the-president action-suspense dramas out there. Perhaps doing a couple of rewinds, and then a split screen or something. Could have been a 7 in my book, but I actually turned to my husband and asked, "how many times do we have to watch the same thing?" That loses a point, and makes it a 6. Glad I rented it, wouldn't have been happy if I paid to see it in a theater though. Good story, neat idea, they just took it a little too far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is truth?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whew! This has to be the most exciting film I have seen this year. The heart-stopping action doesn't stop and you are sitting on the edge of you seat wondering what is happening.This is actually the same story - the same 15 minutes - told from the perspective of different people. Just when you think you may know what is happening, you go to a different perspective and you have to change your thinking. You may think that you are watching the same thing over and over, but there are subtle differences in each viewing depending on who the focus is on.The direction by Pete Travis in Barry Levy's script was flawless. The casting was stupendous. Dennis Quaid as a secret service agent back on the job after a tragedy, a la Clint Eastwood in In The Line of Fire was brilliant. Quaid gave a first rate performance as a focused agent with deep emotional problems. He was a joy to watch.But, he wasn't the only joy. Forest Whitaker was stupendous as an American tourist who gets in the middle of things. He was not the hero type, but he came through in a magnificent performance.Ayelet Zurer (Munich) was a fascination to watch; Sigourney Weaver was amazing as a hardened news-person who showed her humanity at just the right time; William Hurt as the President had gravitas to be sure, and his role has to be viewed to be appreciated; and Eduardo Noriega will go to the top of my list of actors to look for in the future. He was perfect for his part.Those who think that truth is an absolute need to see this film. It should be required for the first day of every history class to let students know that there are always different perspectives on history. Prosecuting attorneys may want to add this to voir doir, because if you have seen it, you will not be likely to take just one opinion for anything.Finally, the car chase through Mexico City has to be the greatest of all time. Bullitt can't touch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting idea, just not developed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They had an interesting idea, but it just didn't play out. There wasn't enough time given to really build up a mystery that I cared about enough to want to see the solving of. Also, the rewinding things got annoying. I did not appreciate watching the president get shot four of five times over. The same footage too, in some parts. It just didn't do it for me. They spent too much time just trying to cram in what happened, not necessarily how it all come together, or even why really. They showed the terrorists actually carrying out the plan, but how did they get it all to work? You barely have enough time to get attached to any of the characters either. The only one who I felt the audience had any attachment to at all was the black guy who helped the little girl. Don't ask me what any of their names are either. Overall, I would not recommend seeing it.</fullReview>

An assassination plot told in different character point of views by rewinding the same scene. Every time it rewinds you find something new and will keep you edge of your seat! The car chase towards the climax is well made. Something very close to Bourne Supremacy (my favourite yet) and Italian Job. Acting wise,Whitaker excels, Quaid seem upset throughout the film (in fact he is).It's a fast ride so hold tight!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Mujahadin tricked me into seeing this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to see this film based on the movie poster -- yes, has a respectable cast; yes, features intrigue with some sort of "vantage point" twist. For this I give the producers the credit of having drawn me into the theater. No further credit will be given.The film starts out poorly. We have Sigourney Weaver resurrecting her pushy character from Working Girl working for an American news channel. Fear grips me along with a sense of impending doom -- I can tell already this movie was written by a team of hacks. We have blatantly prototyped characters and loud, obnoxious, American anti-Americanism from the get go.Mind you, I have nothing against anti-Americanism -- just don't make it cute, preachy or get it mixed up with a the-Mujahadin-is-out-to-get-us plot, (or attempt thereat).Vantage Point opts-out from giving characters credible reasons for their actions. Thus, we follow the vantage points of several complete idiots. Watch as each successive vantage point reveals new holes in the increasingly worthless plot. Embrace the mindlessness of it all, or just hold on there buddy, there'll be a big car chase eventually and then everything will fall into place! Well, maybe they won't fall into place, but wasn't that car chase awesome?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so the film has plenty of plot holes and some absurd and silly twists, but it did keep me entertained enough that I managed to ignore my crackberry for the length of the film. There were some laughable moments, but if you're prepared to suspend disbelief, as you should be to watch most Hollywood action films, it does deliver enough fast paced action to get your pulse up. The acting was good, the multiple view points added an interesting angle and wasn't nearly as bad as some people have complained about in their comments here. You won't go away with a sense of wonder, or be discussing the intricate details of the plot over dinner a week later and the film certainly won't change your life, but you should be entertained for the duration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film started off badly .. for the first 60 minutes the trailer is expanded upon the story develops within the first 60 seconds and then they progress to imprint this indelibly within your memory. Take every opportunity after the first scene to grab some more popcorn, phone up your accountant, pop to the bathroom; or get yourself a nice relaxing massage; you can come back at any time, without feeling you missed anything. Then the film actually starts within the final half hour (i may be exaggerating, but i'm sure it went on for the full hour); there are a great couple of action scenes, and i'm sure the filming for this project was difficult, (setting the scenes again and again) so watch it if you like that kind of thing. Or if you appreciate the standard of personal insult only Hollywood can provide; even Homer Simpson could have kept up with the plot twists (being at least 3 steps ahead). As i mentioned there are a great couple of action scenes; one reasonable car chase, (after all it was no Ronin). A wealth of acting ability I can only assume either there was very little story to work with; or the direction was terrible.</fullReview>

The plot collapses immediately; it is well known that no wireless application can operate in a range of 300 meters around the president of the U.S.A..... Cellular phones, detonators, etc. should be "dead". So, nothing that happened in the movie could ever happen..I wish Hollywood paid more attention to realism. Realism is sacrificed in the altar of the "action". I expected a movie that refers to a fact which is "probable" to happen would not make such terrible mistakes.. Nice try though.. Someone that does not care about realism would probably like this movie. And something more.. When a car is smashed by a truck, I would expect the airbags to open..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point is a political thriller starring Dennis Quaid, Matthew Fox, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver. The story is basically about a summit in Spain where the 'fake' US president gets assassinated and a few minutes later a bomb explodes. This story is told from eight different points of view. From the TV producer in the back of her van to the tourist black guy holding a video cam and to the real President himself. Editing must have been a hell of a job because there's a lot of editing in here. Every time a point of view is told, we are treated to a 'rewind' effect and goes back in a flashback manner to 12:00PM, minutes before the assassination. They used the same technique over and over again until we reach the climactic ending that intertwines the fate of all 8 people ala 'Babel'.Was it good? Yes. I enjoyed it quite a lot. Whitaker, Quaid and Hurt did what they were paid to do: to act well. Newcomer Matthew Fox (Lost) was a surprise. He steered clear of his 'Good Boy' image from Lost and took a villainous turn in this film. Good for him. Although Sigourney Weaver only appeared in the first part of the film, I can say that she also did her job well. I mean all she had to say was "Oh my God" and "What the hell happened?!" over and over.There is one itsy-bitsy problem though: the ending. I felt that it was too abrupt and it ended very quickly. I wanted more out of it. All this time I was thinking they were building up the tension for a bad ass ending and then it just ended just like that. It turns out the film is about a failed kidnapping attempt to the President of the States. The poor terrorists didn't even reach the rendezvous point. Poor poor.I would also like to mention that there is no backstory given to the terrorist cell who failed to kidnap the President. Their motives were unclear, I don't know if their drive has got something to do with Morocco harboring their co-terrorists or whatnot. Matthew Fox's betrayal was also unclear. He just turned into a bad guy, no motive whatsoever.Well, at least the car chase scene made up for it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent suspense/action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this one at the Sacramento Six Drive-In, and though not an ideal "drive-in movie" I think this one provided enough entertainment to be worth the price and the time. A lot of times I see a movie at the drive-in and I think to myself "wow I would feel ripped off if I actually spent $8 just to see that one movie" but not with this one. It was a lot of fun just to see Dennis Quaid in action again, and he really went to town with his role. Forest Whitaker is always worth watching, and in this one he utilizes his great ability to make us believe something important is happening with his character even though it really isn't a very interesting role or story. We were a bit disappointed that there wasn't more of Sigourney Weaver in the movie though, it's been a while since we've seen much of her in a straightforward film.Basically the movie is about an assassination attempt on the President of the US, told through the various "vantage points" of the observers at the scene. Quaid is a secret service agent back on the job a year after taking a bullet for the same President. Whitaker is a tourist who happens to have a very durable video camera on hand at the event and perhaps catches a glimpse of the shooter in his lens. Weaver is a journalist covering the event, and William Hurt plays "POTUS" (President of the United States). Sa?d Taghmaoui is very impressive as the head of the operation, and Matthew Fox plays a big role whose significance isn't apparent until towards the end.The movie wasn't really trying to say anything all that interesting about politics, terrorism, or even humanity as far as I could tell. Its biggest flaw and potential undoing is just the sheer unlikeliness of many of the proceedings... it's one of those movies where you are going to occasionally slap your head and say "oh, come on!" However I was impressed with the action of the film -- it's fast paced but not in such a way as to give you a headache like some of these other 21st Century action films. There's a very exciting (and, like much of the film, improbable) car chase that reminded me of the chase through Paris in "A View to a Kill" where James Bond drove a similar small blue economy car through crowded European streets. If the movie's tone was just a bit lighter, the fact that Quaid's car gets completely crushed and he walks (no... runs!) away unharmed wouldn't be so bothersome. But given the fact that I was watching it at a drive-in, I wasn't too inclined to take the movie very seriously anyway so I just took it as a big lark, and pretty good entertainment superior to "The Italian Job" or "The Sentinel" or most suspense movies I've seen from the last few years. The device of "rewinding" the film to show the other perspectives is nothing new of course but it did keep me and my friends glued to the film to see what would develop next, and each segment seems to end on a note of mystery which will only be resolved tangentially in a later "vantage point." Ultimately the movie is clever and intelligent enough to be entertaining, and it features a lot of great stars doing work that's somewhat beneath them but each giving the film a lot of integrity. Given the way the film sets up a political situation you kind of hope that the film will have something more interesting to say towards the end, and it's hard to care about Quaid's discovery or his relationship with POTUS. However the film is well enough made that it stands up simply as an action film providing a chance for the aging Quaid to stretch his muscles perhaps one last time for us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>VANTAGE POINT's "advantage point" is in the cast of actors who bring to this story maturity and a reality that otherwise this film would have not been taken seriously. Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt and Dennis Quaid introduce a film which once again takes us into a foreign land with the evil threat of terrorism set against what perhaps CNN might have had in store for us via the marvelous bitchy and cynical role of television producer captured by Weaver on screen.The film has endless flashbacks which move the plot forward,but at one point those flashbacks begin to seem very tiresome and you want the Director to use a more clever method of presenting the story and moving it forward. So, if you want a film that has a good twist, car chases and a foreign land, then VANTAGE POINT might be your choice of action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, this movie had a lot of publicity. You would expect that with any movie. But with Cloverfield, I wasn't going to take any chances. So I had to check this movie out. After a few commercials ( one for 88 Minues, which look interesting.), the movie starts.The movie starts out with a woman operating a news station (GNN). It's her point of view. They show the president getting shot. What will really jolt you is when the person broadcasting starts to explain things. In mid-sentence, the stage goes off in a big and load BOOM. It'll scare the heck out of anyone not suspecting it. The lady brodcasting is now supposedly dead. Then Dennis Quaid breaks in and asks to see their tapes. He sees something not on camera, that we don't see, and leaves. Soon afterwards the movie goes back and tells the story of Dennis Quaid. After that, the movie rewinds itself(trust me, I mean it) and tells the stories of the others. Eventually, you find out the dude onstage that got shot was a double, and the real president is now kidnapped in a ambulance. Some of the stangers, the 8, die, and others help each other. Some are barly used at all. In the end, the president lives and everything is OK.Vantage Point was a great movie. It had it's twists and turns, it's unbelievable plot holes, etc. But over all, it was a preatty darn good movie. The ending could have been better, and they could have pulled it off with less rewinds, but it was worth a 9.50 ticket in my eyes. Over all, it was worth it. 8/10</fullReview>

Its the same events done over in rapid succession and it gets tiring and boring very fast. Part of the problem is that once the events play through they take things to a certain point and then fade out on a cliff hanger then rewind from a new point of view. this would be okay except that the events aren't all that interesting. Lets face it they've stretched a twenty minute short to 90 minutes by replaying it again and again. Its also not the sort of tale that needs to be told like this, there is no Rashomon like tale here, its an assassination and thats all. We get very little character development because we're in a tiny time frame so you don't really care. And whats worse the film cheats in a couple of places-things are never quite the same and some people see things they really shouldn't have. I suppose if you don't think and are undemanding its a fun ride, however for me I was bored silly by the middle of the second go round.3.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film obviously isn't out to change the world, but it will make a Saturday evening pass OK.I liked the different viewpoints of the characters - Forrest Whitaker being my least favorite. A little too earnest. William Hurt isn't one of my favorite actors, but he was OK here as a "nice" president who wants to Do The Right Thing. He was a bit too good.The plot progression during the various viewpoints was a good way to show this fairly rote thriller. The baddies were bad, and the good guys were ultra good. No room for in-between here. There could have been more character development but with so much ground to cover (literally) there wasn't time.My biggest gripe is that the car chase at the end was twice as long as the part that was supposed to be going on at the same time was taking. Not to mention the straining of disbelief that Harrison Ford, oops, Kiefer Sutherland, oops Dennis Quaid survives a massive car crash, but another person is fatally injured in his.Like my title says, it's great for a Saturday night out with friends and it kept me awake, which I can't say for The Simpsonss' Movie or One Missed Call.

		<fullReview>From what appeared to be a fascinating premise it ended as a run-of-the-mill action film. Good cast of actors but not given a great deal to work with. The suspense always remains high &amp; keeps you guessing but too many holes, pointless sub-plots &amp; scenes repeated ruin this.The premise of 8 different opinions is a good one but the film was too rushed &amp; the proportions were all wrong, hence, the first two or three times the clock rewound you could sense an intrigue and anticipation of the cinema-goers. By the 5th &amp; 6th time it was just tired groans.The Sigourney Weaver character was underused, whilst Forest Whitaker kept recurring but never became that interesting. Too many characters, mainly amongst the villains were killed off - not a problem except if rendered sub-plots completely pointless. Why did the shooter need a brother who was hostage? What did that add? We never got to know the character so why attempt to reduce his evilness but none of the others? We didn't need to know Forest Whitakers' family life, nor did the little girl add anything until the last 2% of her story. Lots of other overused cliché's and a vastly OTT &amp; overlong car chase hindered this.It was a good film &amp; I'd recommend it but it wasn't a final draft. The time &amp; story devoted to the individuals &amp; their stories was all wrong.But even without that, like Memento I try to judge films with a unconventional style on whether the plot had enough twists and drama had it been told in the conventional format. This did not. Worth a watch though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Multi-layered thriller around a Presidential assassination attempt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what can be said to testing times, the producers of Vantage Point have put together a topical film centring around an assassination attempt on the US President. The film is set in Spain, where the President is in town for an International Summit, joined by the his entourage, the media and a bunch of well organised terrorists on his tail.Action and tension from the start with the assassination occurring early in the film, but then the film begins to divide into different layers. The film takes each set of characters (the Bodyguard, the tourist, the media) one at a time, and then shows the incident and the happenings from each of their perspective (basically a type of flashback to the scene). By doing this the film is enabling the viewer to have an almost omniscient view of the happenings.This being a thriller, the more we see the more we learn and effectively the story twists at certain points. Chases on foot and then by car add to the heightened sense of tension in the film amongst the havoc. Acting is generally fine with Dennis Quaid (as the bodyguard) becoming the main focus of the film, probably at his best for a while.The downside is though that as the film (esp in the first hour) keeps on re-tracing backwards it can get a bit tiresome and frustrating watching the same thing over and over again. The story is quite good, but personally i felt it turned into quite a straightforward thriller in the last 30min although it generally still worked, but the story and certain coincidences become a little too implausible.Overall, a good fair movie for a night out but could have been even better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dennis Quad was superb! Good plot. I thought this would be just another movie about how the Secret Service's agents are perfect. I was wonderfully surprised that this is not just another boring movie filled with the investigation of a case. This movie is full of action. It kept my interest because most of the movie was not easy to figure out. I love Dennis Quad's past work and he was great in this movie also. It seems that Forest Whitaker can play any role he is given. I had never heard of Ayelet Zurer, but she was great in the movie. She is beautiful and talented. She knows how to use her beauty. I highly recommend this movie. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi to everyone, first of all i want to say i'm from Spain and seeing this movie, made me feel bad, because even if in the movie i could see an Spanish Actor, he only appears 5 min and his characters could be erased in the movie, and nobody would care, but the most important thing i didn't like, it's that in this movie Spain seems like an Arab country, which is not.BE CAREFULL **SPOILERS **OK, now the movie...1. Why they need to kill the brother of the Terrorist if i'm sure they could find someone to do it without problem. 2. Don't know, why Noriega gives the woman the bag with the explosives. 3. Why they try to save the girl at the end, after they kill half of the city. 4. When the terrorist and Eduardo Noriega are under the bridge, ?they know each other? didn't know... 5. Piloted assault riffles... that's knew...I'm sure I'm missing something, but there are to many big mistakes to give this movie an average mark, and even a 4 is to much for this.Rent this movie on DVD, and if you've visited Spain, you will see it's not like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe not for the impatient</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't include a synopsis. I will say I definitely enjoyed this fast paced action thriller. I had obviously heard about the filming from differing perspectives, and wondered how this would work. For me, it did. I enjoyed how the quick hypotheses I made from one perspective was either proved/disproved in the following scenes. It made me eager to view the other vantage points to complete this deftly created jigsaw. The action rose steadily as you learned more of the complete scenario, culminating in a frantic chase across the city.Due to the film's nature, characterisation was relatively thin, but enough to become engaged with the players. The whole cast was strong, with particular mention to Forrest Whittaker and Sigourney Weaver. Dennis Quaid was great, although sometimes his character seemed almost cartoon super hero. I heard some members of the audience moan a little after the 4th or 5th 'rewind', but I'd say definitely go to see this film. Some people might just need a little more patience with it's construct.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie format is NOT for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I enjoyed this movie.You are forced to watch what is basically a "short film" through the eyes of different characters. You know what is eventually coming every time but the details are different each time. With each point of view, you are able to put more pieces together and figure out what is really going on.The actors in each point of view did a great job. I was satisfied with the acting and dialog. The action sequences were well done and believable. No over the top nonsensical violence. Just enough action to tell the story.There were some people in the audience who did not appreciate watching what they believed to be the same thing over and over again. But each telling of the actual event is different from each other. Different motivation, attitude, and goals.This is not your typical action movie and i actually thought it was a breath of fresh air in the way they chose to present their story. It's not perfect but better than your average Hollywood "good guys vs bad guys" flick.If you're looking for a linear nonstop shoot em up thriller, this movie is not for you.BUTIf you're looking for something different that will challenge you to figure out what is going on and who is responsible for what; then give this movie a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't buy it (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose I was entertained, but you really might need to check your brain at the door for this one, I didn't buy any of it. Calling this unbelievable and over the top is an understatement for sure. There is a car chase that lasts forever, a separate chase on foot, and an ambulance speeding away from the scene, they all seemed to end up in the same place ("7 blocks from the plaza"...only 7 blocks, with the length of the car chase I thought they should have been in France), under the same stupid overpass. A 290 pound Forest Whittikar manages to chase a very fit suspected terrorist without losing any ground, and Forest never stops filming with his digital video camera as he runs. He also somehow manages to keep up with the bad guy and all of the cars, Forest is really some guy! He must have really prepared for this movie, he's ready for the summer Olympics for sure. The President is unlucky enough to have the stupidest, least loyal members of the secret service on his staff, along with some of the worst shots in the world. We never learned much about the conspiracy, the motive or the terrorists, who as ruthless as they were, their plan was ultimately foiled because at the last minute the bad guy boss swerved an ambulance to avoid a cute little girl and flipped over. Of course that's after he blew hundreds of innocent people up with two separate bombs. I would have thought someone that cold hearted would have squashed that kid like a bug and not even noticed the little speed bump going under the tires. It's sort of a fun movie, just don't think, and enjoy the violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Vantage Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, a warning. This film is not told in your standard narrative style of having the story told from start to end. I can't figure out why teenagers were chuckling at it, because it's one of the many ways to keep you in suspense as the details slowly get pieced together, with each part of the puzzle from the vantage point of 8 individuals being joined at one point or another, without which there wouldn't be any whodunnit element, and too many jump cuts from one POV to the other in one single timeline. So there's nothing really amusing about it.That said, you would've gathered from the trailer that this is about an assassination attempt on the life of US President Ashton, played by William Hurt, and the pieces of evidence that different characters have depending on their points of view - innocent bystander, television crew, perpetrators and of course, the US Secret Service, led by Dennis Quaid's Thomas Barnes and Matthew Fox's Kent Taylor.I've always maintained Dennis Quaid as your alternative to Harrison Ford, and here, he takes on a Clint Eastwood like role in being part of the President's detail who has taken a bullet for him, and is now back on active duty. But while he's given top billing in the movie, the movie's divided quite evenly amongst the rest of the cast, save for perhaps Sigourney Weaver as a television news producer. While each individual thread contributed to enriching the story as a whole, I thought that Forest Whitaker's POV was one of the weakest, and brings back memories of Cloverfield's designated cameraman role in wanting to capture the "moment" for all and sundry to see.It also dwelled a bit on American arrogance, where if the movie is to be believed, then the Secret Service has quite a lot of clout to be blazing their guns opening fire amongst sections of crowds, so long as the big man is down - whatever it takes to bring in / take down those whom they believe are involved in the assassination. What I had wanted to see from the suggestion of the trailer was that car chase scene where Quaid's car got smashed from the side, and no doubt it's been a while since I've seen an exhilarating chase sequence from an action movie of late. Kudos to the stunt team here in having 2 mid-sized saloons weave through crowded streets of vehicles and people, and totally let it rip into utter mayhem.One thing's for sure though, that the "bad guys" aren't always as dumb as we'd like them to be. Case in point already through recent incidents at home, and underestimating, lulling into complacency and predictability are three of the worst enemies any protective detail could succumb toward. Of course the screenwriters here have it all planned out to make everyone look smart, and at the end of the day, in crafting a hero out of the situation. But that's just movie-land. Recommended for action movie junkies to tide through the temporary dearth these days, and for that chase sequence which was worth every minute of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent and intelligent action thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Vantage Point' has to be one of the best films I've seen in the cinema this year (albeit, it's only March and so far only there has been much tosh that's passed through the cinema screens!). This is a fast-paced, action-cum-political thriller that reaches out to those who enjoy gun fights and car chases but want substance when it comes to the plot and characters. The film centres on the story of the attempted assassination of the American president just as he's about to address a peace conference in Spain. We see the perspective of eight people caught up in the events, from the terrorists themselves to CIA agents to ordinary citizens, with each person holding a piece of the puzzle that comes neatly together to deliver the end result.The cast all succeed in their roles, which wasn't easy considering they couldn't rely on interaction with other characters to hold them up and so much of the film relies on each actor delivering their part of the story in a solid manner. Dennis Quaid and Forest Whitaker were both excellent in their respective roles as two men who are heroes in different ways while Sa?d Taghmaoui, Ayelet Zurer and Edgar Ramirez did well in providing the backbone of the film.'Vantage Point' took a plot and portrayed it in a unique approach, which is partially why I felt it was so entertaining. It kept me on tenterhooks throughout, especially as I waited to see how each character fitted into the story (although, such a way of filming could bore audiences fast if other films decided to copy). While the actual plot was a tad unrealistic and wrapped up in a too convenient manner, I think we accept that this is the norm for most actions films and that is part of what makes them fun. We see enough realism in the news, after all. And the action scenes are shot for maximum entertainment, particularly the car chase which was thrilling without dragging on.Overall, this is an enjoyable film, an intelligent action flick that is short and sweet. It's also of the few films these days which addresses the terrorism threat to the Western World without spoon feeding us some over-emphasised point or descending into anti-Americanism. Definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't be put off by the lowish score. I just spent an engrossing 90 minutes watching this film. You are drawn in right from the start and a little piece of the puzzle is added with each "rewind". OK some elements of the plot were confusing but it pretty much comes together well at the end. The pacing is good and if your like me you will be looking at your watch when the titles come up to check that 90 minutes have really just flown by. There is a strong cast with solid acting, and good to see Dennis Quaid in a key role. The European setting makes a pleasant change and the car chases were well done. I can see why some would not like the "Rewind structure" as it is used pretty much until last 1/4 of the film and is very different to that of most movies. Persevere with it however and you will be rewarded.........good movie!.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People don't seem to understand what the writers and director were going for.It doesn't seem like this film ever attempts to be a mystery or going for one of the most intelligent films of our time. It tells a short story from many different...vantage points and adds a piece of the plot at the end of each viewpoint. It's a suspense/action film with a relatively simple and realistic plot. There weren't really many twists per se, upon the first initial viewing, basically the closest thing to a suspect that we were given was the Spanish cop who was apprehended and common sense says he couldn't be the shooter since there's no way he could have been down from the window in time. It's not trying to be a murder mystery ala a a few suspects, 1 lying etc. unless you want to consider all thousands of people there suspects. I also don't believe the film was meant to tease us as the closest thing to a red herring was the curtains fluttering via a fan.I think they accomplished their goal; to be a unique film with a timeline (about 30-40 minutes) shorter than the running time and tell an action packed story. You know this because it's not like anything happened in the final 10 minutes that totally shocks anyone. Probably the 2 most shocking things in the film (the rogue agent and the president double) are revealed in the middle third.I also liked how they kept a good balance in terms of plot depth. It didn't have an overloaded plot that the average viewer could not possibly follow but it did have enough to keep the pace rolling.So obviously this film doesn't do anything groundbreaking to merit top 250 consideration but it certainly provides for good entertainment while providing a plausible and engaging plot and was unique in its own way.</fullReview>

They didn't write the script. The characters were very superficial, and not developed properly. Dennis Quad's character was one dimensional and stiff. The car chase was not believable. A tiny bot-type car gets thrashed against a wall by a huge truck, and yet the character walks away from the incident practically unaffected- continues to pursue the attackers on foot?!?!?! The plot line didn't make a lot of sense either. The cause for the assassination /kidnapping was never fully explained. The attacker was able to execute the entire scheme through his phone!

		<fullReview>Okay, VANTAGE POINT is a gimmick movie. It is not a psychological study or a piece of political propaganda or even a serious drama about, well, anything. But it does embrace its gimmick wholeheartedly and runs with it. It is a popcorn thriller, and if it can be viewed from any serious perspective it would be as a study on the use of editing to tell a story and to manipulate an audience.The film begins with TV coverage of a presidential visit to Spain, where the Commander-in-Chief will be attending a summit on global terrorism. A P.R. stop before a cheering crowd leads to an assassination attempt and a terrorist bombing. This is all in about the first 15 minutes of the movie, at which point the story stops and literally rewinds to repeat the action from a different vantage, only now focusing on a single character. Then the film does it again and again, telling the story from a half-dozen angles and as many different people. Each segment becomes increasingly longer and more complex -- as well as increasingly more exciting and progressively more absurd.VANTAGE POINT has been compared to both RASHOMON and GROUNDHOG DAY, though neither comparison is truly accurate. It does not tell the same story from conflicting points of view like RASHOMON, nor does it tell the same story repeatedly with differing outcomes like GROUNDHOG DAY. Rather the story is told again and again, with each version adding to and altering the reality with new information. If anything, the story owes the most to episodic TV: Each cycle of the story builds to its own shocking cliffhanger, with each subsequent segment beginning with a recap of what has come before -- the ticking clock building up to the 12 noon starting point could easily be accompanied with a stern voice-over announcing "Previously on ....!" The film begins seriously enough, with Sigourney Weaver as a TV news director covering the events that lead to the shooting and the bombing. It is a marvelous start to a geopolitical thriller, allowing the viewer to grasp the story the way most people view world events, in sound bites and film clips. But each restart of the story -- from the perspective of a Secret Service agent (Dennis Quaid), a tourist (Forest Whitaker) with a video camera, the President (William Hurt), etc. -- strays a little bit more from reality. When it is mentioned that the President has a security "double," it pretty much becomes clear that the film has no intentions of seeming like a documentary. And though it never becomes a comedy, it does become a lot of fun if you just let the story unfold in unexpected plot twists and unlikely action sequences.With generic terrorists (their nationality, cause and intentions are never really made clear) and main characters who constantly seem to be literally on the run, it is left up to the actors to somehow create three-dimensional characters out of thin air. They meet the challenge well enough, though they are really at the mercy of a story pieced together out of chaos and frantic editing. Screenwriter Barry Levy may have chosen a ridiculously complicated way to tell the story, but with the help of Peter Travis' fast-paced direction the film doesn't become really all that confusing. After the fact, you might find yourself quibbling over plot details, but the film itself moves too fast to allow you to dwell over the minor questions.Perhaps, in these times, it is wrong to make such a frivolous movie about terrorism and political assassination, but if such a movie has to be made, it could be far worse than this. And quite honestly, an absurd piece of fiction is always preferable to a dishonestly sanctimonious piece of shallow propaganda like SYRIANA. VANTAGE POINT is good, old-fashioned entertainment, geared to push buttons, not change minds. So from one angle, it may not be a smart movie, but from a different vantage point, it is certainly a clever one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever idea, flawed execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point deals with an assassination attempt on the life of the US president as seen from several different point of views. The first one is from the TV producer covering the event. We then see the same event from the point of view of a secret service agent, tourist, and others. As each version is showing, little details are added, until the final version where everything is revealed.The performances from the cast led by Dennis Quaid, Forest Whitaker, Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt are all very good. Pete Travis directs the script by Barry Levy very well. He stages the action scenes very well, including a superb car chase through the streets of Spain. And even though we see the same event several times, he manages to keep it fresh yet consistent.However there are flaws. Once it's revealed what is really going on, the film does lose it's way a little. A supposed shocking reveal of a traitor was actually very easy to spot pretty early on. Also, although most of the characters have no actual connection until the assassination attempt and subsequent explosion, the climax of the movie is contrived to bring all the characters back together in a different way. Sadly, it doesn't quite work. Having said that this doesn't spoil the ending which is quite well staged.This is an attempt to make an action thriller that will keep the audience guessing. While it didn't keep me guessing completely, I was entertained all the way through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining (though far-fetched) political and action thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because of an entirely superficial link to Rashomon (1950) the audience might have heard, their perception of "Vantage point" are hopelessly distorted before they walk into the cinema. Forget Rashomon.VP is an above average political action thriller, attributable to a number of things: good action sequences (including car chase, naturally), fast pacing (which helps you to ignore the weak script), a stellar cast (albeit with limited acting challenges). As well, it cannot be denied that the somewhat unusual packaging of covering the first half from 5 different vantages points makes it more interesting to watch, although some are not receptive to it, citing repetitiveness. It's really a matter of personal taste.Showing the same sequence more than once is hardly novel technique. Coming to mind right away are two movies* (one French and one Japanese), both showing the same events twice, to tell the audience that "things are not what they seem". VP however is very different. The opening sequence is repeated again and again, from different POVs, as a technique to reveal more and more information. It is not set up to be a mystery, but just holding back information to keep the audience interested, as one would do in any other movie.I'll refrain from getting into more details, but just say that in addition to serving as a technique of telling the story, the different vantage points also provide a little glimpse into various characters: the TV ("GNN") news in-charge handling her job and responding to abrupt challenges, the security man who took a bullet to save the president 6 months ago struggling to shake loose the psychological block, among many others.As mentioned, the fast pacing and good action sequences did a good job in covering up the many flaws of this movie: lacking in depth, unconvincing events, cardboard figure terrorists, plot holes. It is also fun to watch two Oscar Best Actors, one Oscar Best Actress nominee (twice) and one Golden Globe Best Supporting Actor nominee, even though these aren't exactly their award-aspiring performances.* A la folie?pas du tout (2002) Unmei janai hito (2005)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasantly surprised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a flip of the coin to which movie I was going to see today, with someone else doing the coin toss and we ended up seeing Vantage Point. From the previews I was not expecting too much and honestly I was not looking forward to this movie. I was pleasantly surprised and this movie held my interest throughout. I thought it was well done and well acted. I am sure I could find some flaws in the flick but any flaws were minor compared to the overall quality of the movie. I really enjoyed it. Perhaps I was not expecting the thrill ride that I received since since the expectations were low and when I received so much more than expected I was glad I went.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overplotted And Gimmicky Action Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point is a political action thriller film that was adapted from a screenplay written by Barry L. Levy. The story focuses on an assassination attempt on the President of the United States as seen from a different set of vantage points through the eyes of eight strangers. Dennis Quaid, Matthew Fox, Forest Whitaker, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver star in principal roles together with Édgar Ramírez,Eduardo Noriega,Ayelet Zurer,Richard T. Jones,Bruce McGill and Zoe Saldana. The film recounts a series of events which are re-enacted from several different perspectives and viewpoints in order to reveal a "truthful" account of what happened. Vantage Point explores kidnapping, assassination and terrorism.It was directed by Pete Travis.In the movie,the president arrives in Salamanca and then gunshots ring out. An American tourist has captured footage of the would-be assassin on videotape, and now, as the stories of the other four witnesses unfold, each essential piece of the puzzle quickly falls into place. Only when all of the stories are told will the chilling truth to this shocking crime finally emerge.Vantage Point falls into the trap of being an overplotted, gimmicky presidential-assassination thriller that has its interlocking pieces have to fit just so for it to stay coherent and ratchet up the tension. Unfortunately,its structure of narration challenges the audience's patience and also probably its wit and imagination.But when everything is finally revealed in the end, the story tells is fairly pedestrian, and nothing special is gained from all the stopping and restarting.Overall,it is just a good action movie that one may enjoy watching over the weekend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Worst Big-Budget Films I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to make this really short because I don't think Vantage Point is worthy of much discussion.The script is appalling. First, it tries to be Rashomon by telling the same story over and over again from different characters' perspectives but forgets one important detail. If the story isn't interesting, it's going to stay that way no matter how many times you how look at it. In this case, the story is as one-dimensional as they come. A group of terrorists try to assassinate the U.S. President. That's all there is to it - no social commentary, no subplots, and nothing minutely interesting. As for the dialogue, it seems to have been written by a film student receiving a failing grade.The actors are all big names (Dennis Quaid, Forrest Whittaker, Sigourney Weaver, and William Hurt) but they simply can't overcome the insanity of the script. Everyone overacts, especially Quaid and Whittaker. Quaid looks like he's sucking on a lemon at all times, and Whittaker makes grotesque, unintentionally funny facial expression. Actually, the latter criticism can be applied to the entire cast.The film only functions as a pretentious unintentional comedy. Seeing as we have more than enough of those, Vantage Point is destined to be forgotten (and it should be).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great cast. I can only imagine that they got them together due to a common cause, a political message, since there is little else to the script. It should have been either a 30 minute short, or two hours of great acting. Instead, we have 15 minutes of action, distraction and melodrama, plus "the message", drawn and quartered into 90 minutes.In the role of action, we have a plot that almost disguises itself as being clever, which includes explosions and assassins! In the role of distraction, we have Dennise Quaid as the scarred and frazzled protector of the king.In the role of melodrama, we have the much wasted talent of Forest Whitaker. It's really sad.And the message (which I generally agree with), delivered by the great William Hurt. Let's hope for better movies for William Hurt... before it's too late.I'll also mention Sigourney Weaver as the "how about playing the savvy veteran news producer?".Those who watch this movie should be prepared to use the fast forward button generously.</fullReview>

This is not standard fare, it is quite superior. It seems like everyone took a vote and agreed to hate this movie. I say, "BS!" This is very compelling and thrilling. Excellent performances. The action is staged and photographed brilliantly. The locations are outstanding. This is by far one of the best action thrillers. I just finished watching "I Am Legend" and "Vantage Point" on HD. "Vantage Point" is every bit as good. I think this movie was buried because of the politics.</fullReview>

At the end, when everything came together, it was the best cinematography that I've ever seen. As a matter of fact, I replayed the ending 30 times. I couldn't believe how magnificent it was, no kidding. The music and action was unbelievable and extremely moving. Dennis Quaid was spell binding, and the other players were absolutely magnificent. I can't say enough about this movie. In my opinion, it should be nominated for an Academy Award in several categories, Best Picture, Best Cinematography, maybe even Best Actor, Quaid was that good, as well as the other players in supporting roles. What a wonderful, clever film.I have small children and have seen the animated movie "Hood Winked". Did the playwright get any ideas from that? Anyway, it was extremely well done and worth anyone's time to watch, again and again.I original saw this when my brother rented it, I re-rented it that same day, and can't wait to buy it.

		<fullReview>Incorporating thematic elements of the Bourne series, Vantage Point seeks to redefine it's genre through an experience of interactivity only thought possible through voting keypads. It allows each viewer to see what they want to see, or to understand that their vantage point is unique, much like everyone else's in the film. Just when you think you've figured out what is happening you're shown that while you're correct, it is irrelevant. For it's ability to keep you glued to the screen no matter what, I believe that this is a seminal work of cinematic excellence without rival. Every detail of this film is designed to capture the ADD prone audience, and punish you heavily for any lapses in attention.This film will become a point of reference for it's genre, and I am thankful that it leaves some room for improvement. I can't wait to see what this team turns out next.Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spain. 12:00PM. "GNN" news films as a motorcade of sleek black vehicles escorts the most important man in the world to a square landing where he is to deliver the most critical speech of the year to a crowd of hundreds of supporters. Sharp shooters have been stationed strategically and secret service agents have been scattered throughout the location. The president exits his vehicle and a team of four specially trained operatives escort him to the platform. The crowd cheers the arrival of the president and waves flags in support of his new initiative to combat terrorism. The Spanish mayor finishes his speech and proudly introduces the president. The president opens his arms warmly to his supporters below and smiles wide. Suddenly two loud shots ring out and the president falls backwards to the ground. PANIC. The crowd stampedes to the exits and the secret service cover the president while scanning for suspects. A nearby suspect is apprehended who warms that everyone is in danger. The female reporter tries to restrain her emotion and overcome her shock. Crying, she begins to explain to the viewers what has just happened. Suddenly a loud explosion and fireball erupts from the platform and the TV feed is lost. STOP. REWIND.12:00PM. Repeat the same events again. Only this time from the "vantage point" of a secret service agent (Dennis Quaid).We also get to see the event unfold from the "vantage point" of the terrorists, undercover operatives, and innocent bystanders. Each repeat adding new pieces to form the plot of the entire film.The film also touches on many interesting issues such as bias in the media, withholding (or simplifying) information to the public, and how the innocent can inadvertently get involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vantage Point is a wonderfully made movie. From the first scene itself, it makes use of its premise and introduces the plot, and from there on, the movies starts going into a loop, revealing other characters, and with each loop, revealing important new secrets, which change how you look at the plot.You might think, or must have read that it is grating to see the same thing happening all over so many times, but believe me, each time, the story focuses on a different character, and doesn't just show the same thing all over again, but instead, adds new angles and details to the plot.As for performances, almost everyone involved did a good job in the movie, and deserve credit. On the flipside, the only complaint one could have is that the movie gets a little to far-fetched as it progresses, but thats nothing compared to the great time you will have watching it. Must watch for any action thriller fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point is one in a long list of films I've been nervous about, worrying they wouldn't be as good as they looked or as good as I expected them to be. I wasn't disappointed at all after watching this, in fact I was smiling ear to ear. This movie is fantastic and it truly is shot from virtually every view possible, showing every important characters impression of whats happening including the would be assassins. It does this well, in fact it does it very well. The movie never feels repetitive because even though you see some events over and over, you see them from so many different angles and are taken so deeply through the thoughts and actions of each character that it seems like a fresh movie each time. You also see new events from each "vantage point" mixed in with what you've already learned as the film progresses. It's because of this that right up until the end, you'll feel like your watching the beginning of a movie. You never feel as if your in the middle and you'll never see the end coming.The events are indeed thrilling. The foot chases, car chase and shoot outs are all done in a spectacular fashion taking you through every range of emotion there is. I want to make a special note of the car chase, it is absolutely fantastic. A good car chase is always a plus in a thriller and the chase here is easily worthy of a Jason Bourne movie or an installment of the Italian job. It's a real nail biter to say the least.Most of the key pieces of the puzzle as to whats really going on and who's involved are kept well hidden, despite what you may have heard to the contrary. I found only one aspect obvious from the beginning and in all honesty I'm not sure how the film makers could have kept it hidden without hurting the movie and making it confusing. The story is certainly solid, the script is excellent, the acting is fantastic and the camera work couldn't be better. This is a classic thriller and one that I'll watch again.One other note I wanted to make, Dennis Quaid is in true form here. He has always been one of my favorite actors and it's wonderful to me to see him still on top of his game. With vantage point he proves beyond a shadow of a doubt he can do what he has always done best, please an audience and look damn good doing it. He fits the character he portrays here perfectly and is entirely believable in the role. He's in great shape physically and his acting is as it's always been, Oscar worthy. Any Dennis Quaid fan will be pleased with Vantage Point and it's a must see for those who love a good thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband and I loved the movie. Action packed, great escape for a Friday night. Does not require any deep thinking. We especially enjoyed the format of retelling the shooting from the perspective of seven of the characters. Each time a little more of the plot was revealed. Except for the standard auto chase, we thought the plot was somewhat plausible. The Forest Whitaker character added a warm, human touch and provided a welcome contrast from the violence of the shooting, bombing, and searching for the criminals. Interesting to watch the scenes with Sigourney Weaver, playing the producer of the TV news crew, and see how news shows are filmed and what factors determine what is shown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No matter what perspective you look at it from, Vantage Point is a failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point is a political thriller that looks at an assassination attempt on the US president from 8 different people's point of view. The idea is that by seeing the event from different people's perspectives, the "mystery" surrounding it can be revealed. It's an interesting (although not original) idea, and it could work very well if done properly. However, with Vantage Point, you can see that the "different perspectives" were just thrown in as a cheap gimmick to separate this from the rest of the s***ty thrillers flooding theaters these days. In actuality, the different points of view only make this movie worse.Vantage Point starts out presenting the assassination attempt from a TV news producer's point of view, as she watches live camera footage of the event unfolding. The opening is a little dry (as it takes place primarily in a news truck for roughly 10 minutes), but it's moderately interesting. The next point of view is where the problems really start to begin, as the film shows the assassination once again, with almost no changes whatsoever. 10 minutes later, the third point of view shows the exact same event, with maybe one minutes worth of new footage. By the fifth point of view, I was almost at the brink of falling asleep. I realize that there has to be some repetitions in a movie presenting different perspectives on a single event. However, to repeat the same thing over and over, with the only changes being a new characters reaction and a few different camera angles, is inexcusable. Watching Vantage Point is the cinematic equivalent of listening to a scratched record that keeps repeating itself. If I had to sit through the presidents shooting one more time, I probably would've walked out.The films concluding 20 minutes switch from the "Rashomon" style to a traditional, linear format. Not only does this sudden switch not fit in well with the rest of the movie, it makes you realize that there were really no reasons for the film to be in the multiple perspective format in the first place, other than possibly lengthening the running time. The multiple perspectives do work well when revealing twists in the story, but considering the trailer gave away nearly all of them, there's really no point for the film to employ this style. It's a cheap gimmick to draw people in and judging by Vantage Points opening weekend, it worked.The movies second weak point is that it often dangles between a serious political thriller and a campy action flick. While there isn't too much in the way of action, the few action sequences are out of place in a movie that takes itself serious most of the time. One man single handedly takes out the entire US president's entourage using a handgun with a silencer on it. Give me a break! In another sequence towards the end, an FBI agent's car is crushed up against a brick wall by a speeding truck, yet he somehow emerges from the wreckage with only a few scratches on his nose. Is this guy invincible or what? It's stupid, even for a corny, summer, action flick, let alone a movie that attempts to be an "intelligent" thriller.The most shocking thing about this "thriller" is that it somehow managed to get amazing actors in several of the roles. Signoury Weaver, Forrest Whitaker, Dennis Quaid, and William Hurt all appear in significantly big roles. But really, what's the point? The characters are all generic, flat and never developed properly. They're stock characters: the tough FBI agent, the kind family man, the heartless terrorist. With characters this bland, there's no use in getting an A-list cast to portray them. There's nothing for the actors to work with and they end up damaging their reputations. You'd never guess by watching this film that some of them are very successful, let alone Academy Award nominees and winners! No matter what perspective you look at it from, Vantage Point is a mess. There hasn't been a duller studio picture in years. If you want a similar experience, you're better off staying at home, putting in an old DVD, re-watching the first ten minutes 8 times in a row, and saving the money you would've spent on a ticket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've rated this film a 5/10, I consider it to be very average.I appreciate what the movie was trying to do, but, it failed.8 Vantage Point rewinds? Total overkill. 5 would have sufficed, and I obviously wasn't the only one to find them a bit tedious. The rest of the theatre were groaning when we had ANOTHER rewind! The premise of the film was one that excited me, but the actual end product was severely lacking. The movie was aiming for an intelligence level the script writers simply didn't have! Right from the start I guessed that Matthew Fox's character was not a good guy when Dennis Quaid said "thanks for getting me back", and Fox replies "don't thank me yet", a quite obvious setup for later.The car chase has been regaled as 'equalling Bullit and Ronin', and frankly, its nowhere near the class of those. The whole chase looked stage, no spontaneity, no adrenaline, just staged, and at times, i'm sure some of the car movements by Quaids Chevrolet Astra were CGI'd.The editing of the car chase was a joke, the damage to the Astra kept on flipping between battered to pristine and battered again with every shot. Stuart Baird is a good editor, but what goes through his mind when surely even he can see the glaring errors?!? And then there's the huge glaring plot hole at the end of the movie, Quaids character knowing that the President had been abducted, when no-one had told him!??!?! Or that we are to believe that Forrest Whittakers fat character is able to keep up with Secret Service agents chasing the Spanish cop! This film so badly wanted to be seen as an intelligent action thriller with its 'clever' rewinds, but the fact is, in competent hands it might have been interesting, but as it is, its simply guilty of being terribly average, and worst of all, treating the viewer as an idiot!</fullReview>

It is not a suspense, edge of your seat movie. OK maybe for the first 15 minutes or so it is but it takes a dive from serious to hilarious pretty fast. The one major gripe I have is the same camera angle is used in a totally unnecessary spot. They were looking to add a dramatic touch but it really just begins to annoy you. As noted above the car chase is awesome and Dennis Quaid just plays the most badass role. The man is a machine and well its Dennis Quaid hes just awesome to start with. To wrap up this jumble of a review if you want to be entertained this movie is something you want to go see. If your looking for a nail-biting suspense movie, fasten your seat belts because your about to be hit by the disappointment train.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was annoying to me that many in the packed theatre responded with such abandon (groans, laughter, references to Groudhog Day) when the action repeatedly 'rewound' to give yet another character's perspective of the film's main event. I was trying hard to concentrate and forgive Quaid's character's wild-eyed twitching and sweating, which would surely have caught someone's attention before he was assigned to what was touted as an uber-risky and globally important mission ... also hoping that a potential "plot twist" thrown up first thing like a big grapefruit would be a red herring ... and people were laughing and hooting - how rude! Number one: With the ubiquitous previews, how could so many be surprised at the format? And Number 2: Weren't they too engaged, anxious to keep solving the puzzle, to lose focus on the excitement and unfolding drama? Whatever the answer to number 1, number 2 trumps it with its obvious conclusion: "Evidently not." However interesting the concept, I couldn't very well blame my fellow audience members for failing to be sufficiently enthralled. Vantage Point tries to be edge-of-your-seat serious, and a prat-fall by the story-telling device is disappointing to say the least.Worse than any of the above, however, the villains' behavior in THE pivotal moment of the story made me (after keeping sanctimoniously quiet and glaring at my seatmates) almost stand up and yell "WHAT?!?" If there was any groundwork laid for a sudden attack of conscience, that vantage point must be on the cutting-room floor.Vantage Point was entertaining and no more hokey or improbable than other thrillers. William Hurt, Dennis Quaid, Sigourney Weaver and Forest Whitaker are all fun and appealing to watch. The point I guess was that my expectations were higher - comparisons to Rashomon put it at a distinct disadvantage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The classic assassination thriller, with a splash of originality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point was the film I chose to see this weekend at my local theater and I went in with high hopes. The storyline, which is a part-interlocking , part-flashback film (which, for the record, are my two favourite film elements combined into one!) is simple, yet complex to uncover. The film opens at a UN gathering of world leaders in Spain, with a big crowd, in an even bigger square. Suddenly the president of the United States is shot twice by an unseen assassin. The next thing you know, two bombs go off, one of them destroying the square.The film is made up of that story told five times--each from a different point of view from a different person who was there. First, we've got agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid) who is back on assignment after taking a bullet for the president six months prior. He's paranoid, and picks up on any slight signal that could mean an assassination threat. Next, there's a shady looking cop who commits a strange act at the scene--is he corrupt? You decide. Third, we've got the American tourist (Forest Whitaker) who loves videotaping things. Fourth, we have the president himself, and fifth--we see the assassination unfold before our eyes. In addition to these four main characters, there are four others who are involved in the scenes, and combined, makes for a total of eight people searching for the truth--or who are somehow involved in it.Each "vantage point" (hence the film's righteous name) offers more and more clues as to which of these people were involved in the assassination. Director Pete Travis delivers a bang-up job in making the plot line completely and utterly unpredictable. Even most people who can guess plot twists coming at any speed will be left baffled and thinking hard. My favourite aspect of the film was that it was entirely the same thing on repeat--yet different every time. There were some stupid idiots in my theater that were booing every time the scene got restarted, and that's where I think a lot of people will dislike this film, because it is undoubtedly repetitive. However, I feel the redundancy of the film adds to its original essence and its tension. The tension in the film is done very well and the first quarter of the film will have you holding on to your seat. Although there's a more than action packed climax, people who just want to see stuff blown up and people shot and car chases will be left disappointed throughout the movie. Don't worry--even throughout the redundancy there's plenty of that good stuff. My other favourite aspect of the film was its acting--Dennis Quaid was excellent and Forest Whitaker blew me away like he always does, in a role perfectly cast for him. Sigourney Weaver's brief cameos were done very well and everyone in the cast does a great job.All that being said, Vantage Point is definitely not without its flaws. Some of the characters aren't introduced right and the execution in many scenes is done very sloppily. The climax (although ironically long) is extremely rushed and, in my opinion, was done rather poorly. Unfortunately I can't elaborate without giving away major spoilers, but it is a fun ending to watch nevertheless, and you are able to forgive the sloppy editing. The thing that made me want to cry was the horribly clichéd conclusion that shouldn't have happened. In my opinion...they should've revised the screenplay. I hope there's an alternate ending on the DVD.So, if you're looking for a decent thriller or a movie to check out, you might just want to see Vantage Point. The classic assassination thriller, a splash of originality, garnished with great acting and an unneeded sloppy ending turns out to be one bittersweet cocktail. But mostly just sweet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 Points of View. 1 Bad Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As its title implies "Vantage Point" [2008] is about point of view - and I mean it's ALL about point of view. The same fifteen minutes worth of action is numbingly re-told from the point of view of more than half a dozen characters, with each re-telling giving the viewer a bit more information about the workings of the film's terrorist assassination/abduction plot and weaving the characters into an eye catching but pointless tapestry. As an exercise in the techniques of film editing and plot construction, I suppose the film has its merits. But the use of multiple points of view is hardly the revolutionary discovery the film makers seem to think - as those familiar with such time-honored classics as "Citizen Kane,""Rashomon," and "The Killing" may attest. For better or worse, "Vantage Point" also sustains a high pitched kinetic intensity for almost all of its 90 minutes of run time. The exhausting pace of the movie is created - as in the much more successful "Run Lola Run" - via a mix of physical action (running, car chases, explosions), rapid cutting, tight framing, and a relentlessly percussive score. Unlike "Run Lola Run," however, "Vantage Point" offers so little variation in its frenetic style that the film's ending comes more as a relief than a revelation.The film's plot is resolved with what could have been a nice touch of humanistic irony except that, like just about everything in the film, its impact is undercut by utter predictability and by the fact that we just don't care about any of the characters, including the one designed to tug at our heartstrings in the climactic scene. To varying degrees the characters are underdeveloped and their actions are largely unmotivated.. Most appear for very brief periods and then become "glorified extras" (as Dennis Quaid aptly quips in his DVD interview). Why bother to show us the terrorists' point of view (a few times over) if we never learn why they are up to their nasty tricks? The film's director, Pete Travis, claims that the shifts in narrative and camera point of view had the deeper purpose of broadening the audience's sympathy for divergent political and personal attitudes about the depicted action, but that worthy intention just didn't make it to the screen.On a more positive note, the problems with "Vantage Point" certainly do not stem from the casting or acting. The film is very well cast with accomplished American stars and young foreign actors who look the parts and have excellent screen presence. Forest Whitaker as a latter day, digital video camera version of Abraham Zapruder has the best developed part in the script, and he does his usual brilliant job inhabiting it, but his efforts are far from enough to save the day. Dennis Quaid does as much as anyone could expect in the protagonist's role of a psychologically scarred Secret Service presidential bodyguard. His character is similar in outline but not depth to the one played by Clint Eastwood in "In the Line of Fire." Quaid's part is simply underwritten and sacrificed to the film's one-trick pony of technique. Sigourney Weaver is excellent in the film's opening sequence as a hard-edged TV newsroom director, but, again, the part goes nowhere and she barely shows up again. William Hurt's role as a U.S. president attending a Spanish summit designed to bring an end to the Age of Terrorism amounts to little more than a cameo - well, a double cameo, but you'll need to watch the film (or at least its trailer) to get that twist. And, frankly, it isn't worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent movie but many flaws (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a pretty good movie. The first scene, from Sigourney Weaver's control room view, was absolutely incredible. Unfortunately there were many problems. Maybe I've seen too many movies, but as soon as Matthew Fox separated himself and we only heard him over the radio I immediately guessed that he would be a turncoat--which is close to blasphemy, as a Secret Service agent assigned to the Presidential detail would NEVER DO THIS! Anyone who would even consider allowing such a thing to happen (let alone causing it) would not get the security clearance to be in the Service in the first place--forget the POTUS assignment! Other people have pointed out the convenient placement of characters like the little girl's mom just happening to be right across the street at the and. Dennis Quaid was outstanding. He has gotten much better with age and has started making very good role choices. Forest Whitaker is a good actor, but you wouldn't know it from watching this. All he did the whole movie was wander around looking lost. The constant rewinding was a bit of a nuisance, especially the first time when I was sitting there shocked by the reporter's death and the tragic bombing. A more traditional transition would have been less jarring and more appropriate. Still worth watching, but I'm surprised Secret Service people didn't raise a fury.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm shocked that this is only rated at 6.7. This movie is flawless! Well done! in a way most people could never imagine. It's powerful, it's got heart and it blew me away! Vantage Point will give you the eyes of what are great secret service men have most likely dealt with at one time or another in real life. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a real thrill ride. It's today's modern day "In the line of fire"....kinda but 20 times better. Thanks to all the very strong and intelligent actors and actresses, you will not be watching this film, you will feel it! as if this movie were an event! Very intense! it's so brilliantly done that it makes the Bourne Trilogy look as boring as that stupid TV show 24. I'm not dissing Jason Bourne! He was extremely full of non stop action in his movies but Vantage Point takes it up a notch! Maybe even two notches higher! This is definitely Dennis Quaid's best movie ever made! It's through the roof!! IT'S OFF THE HOOOOOK! GO! see this movie when you can! It's refreshing! I felt like the night was young all over again standing up and walking out of the theater from all the energy it gave me from the non-stop, intense!! excitement! and mystery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling, smart and highly engaging - what a rare treat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's very rare to find a film that has non-stop excitement and suspense, while at the same time managing to be quite a smart and engaging thriller which offers something new and original. This film happens to fit the bill, perfectly I might add.The story starts off with a bang, literally as a peace summit is rocked by the assassination of the U.S. President and a subsequent bomb blast. Then the film rewinds on itself, and we go back 23 minutes before this tragedy, to witness the moments leading up to it through the eyes of one of the Secret Service agents escorting the President. The inevitable happens, and we rewind again by 23 minutes to see the events which are about to take place, but this time through the eyes of another witness. We soon get to see the point of view of the tragedy from many different perspectives, and each time another clue comes our way as to what is happening and why.And this is what sets it apart from many in the genre, as the clues start stacking up and the plot starts dishing up twists and turns at every corner. The final twist will definitely leave you in shock, and then soon have you on the edge of your seat for one of the most audacious and thrilling car chases ever seen on film.The performances are all excellent, especially Dennis Quaid (as the lead Secret Service agent) and Forrest Whitaker (as an American tourist). Sigourney Weaver seemed under-utilised, but when that's the only complaint of a film, you'r emore than willing to accept it. Definitely one of the best action thrillers of the year.</fullReview>

(and for us to get the whole picture , from all the VANTAGE POINTS get it !!)But i just have to say this : its not relevant ... ButHow things are portrayed in this movie is very backwards !Why take out all them Spanish people if the movie is about hating the U.s (that i don't understand why??) Why shoot the American president and then when he is not there blow the whole places up????! But nobody has said the terrorists are smart :)) Because they are NOT !!!! :)) They are very very stupid and extreme cowards and evil !! killing and using women and children for horrible things ! The Americans are smart sending in a double and not arrogant (and the U.s and the west is always a step head always...keep dreaming otherwise !! :) so the terrorists didn't do a thing other then killing a lot of innocent people as usual !!and yes they figured out it was a double ...but they shoot him any what does that tell us about them that they are stupid and evil ! America/USA is Muuuuuuuuuch better then they ever will be !The terrorists have No conscience whats so ever ! Friendly Arab-nation ha aha what joke.... no such thing exists !!You will make us very proud by blowing yourself up hahaha another joke !! its a sin in all religions to kill yourself !!hellllllo ! uuuuuhhh very smart having that remote controlled fan .... NOT.. leaves evidence !!And uuuuuhhh being SO brave NOOOOOT !! cant even shoot the gun ....they have a remote on that as well ...talk about being a BIG coward ! And surprise surprise they don't even keep their word !! and kill of the hostage !!And like ONE man can kill off several secret service guys .... not believable at all!!!!!!!!!! yeah right an American citizen would do that !! NOT !!(not for all the reasons and money in the whole world) Give me a break !! The actors are good...yes ! And it is action all the way but the story/script is total JUNK !! not thought thru at all!and well the movie is quite ridiculous and unnecessary and pure fantasy ! almost a comedy in my eyes !Thank god that Americans are tenacious and persevering/persistent.Matthew Fox is not at all believable as a bad guy sorry but he is not !! Yeah this war will end but we (the west and the US) have to do something very drastic to end it (i will not spell it out but if you are smart you can guess what i mean)And the last part does not make sense ... after killing SO many innocent people .... why not run over the girl ?! they killed a whole lot of innocent kids in the bomb-attacks !!But the End was very good because it was like it should be (the west) and The U.s won over the terrorists !! good one :))If this movie has message of the they (the terrorists will win...i say ha-ha never in a million years) and if it is a anti-war message i say war is necessary/unavoidable/inevitable when it is about fighting terror. (because we never can and shall let them win ... that would be our ruin/destruction/demise)I'm personally very sick and tired of all these anti-American pro-terrorist movies that have been done/released lately! see it from the true "vantage point" and you will understand what i mean !Enough politics for now. bye((((((( AND YES i know that this is "just" a movie... but everyone else on IMDb says what they want so i did as well))))))(i gave it it a two because of Dennis Quaid... if not for him i would have given it a 1)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was it a comedy after all?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before going any further I have to say that I generally enjoyed this film. It was easy to watch, pretty exciting and at least to begin with quite clever.The frustrating point is that it could have been a great film. For two thirds of the film it was heading in that direction then it became downright silly. The first two thirds was slick and clever and had a pretty robust story line. Oh why was this not developed properly? The final third was all Hollywood flashing and banging. The dead body count started to increase beyond Terminator levels. Car chasing and crashing became the norm and and worst of all it became downright hilarious. It didn't have to be like that surely? What is amazing is the idea that as long as the President is OK then the world is OK. Who cares about the local populace in such circumstances? God bless America. That's all that matters isn't it? Am I missing something here? Was it a comedy after all?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a great concept - an anatomy of an assassination attempt, the same events replayed through the eyes of 5 people. And it's this concept that no doubt attracted the impressive names attached to the project. Then something when horribly, horribly wrong. Glaring clangers in set design, plot, makeup - everything really! For example, Forrest chases after one of the terrorists and is able to not only keep up, but film the entire thing as well. Abraham Zapruder: you amateur! It turns out that the President of the United States has a double who stands in when the going's a bit tough, POTUS comments "he doesn't even look like me". 400 people in my cinema ask: "is this for real"? The cinema also sighed as each rewind segment started up. Vantage Point is like a fine piece of steak which you cook really badly then drop on the floor. Go see: you won't believe films this big can be this bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before anyone watches this movie, they should be ready to see a repetitive plot which repeats an event over and over again, but the repetitiveness of it makes this movie a March hit! How? IT WORKS! With every vantage point, you learn a new thrilling clue about the event's which occurred prior to the presidents assassination. Every person has a different story and every story has a different shocking secret to be revealed. With two huge twists (one of them ruined by the trailer), you will feel compelled to see the other vantage points until you ultimately learn the truth to the assassination.This "A" list cast was amazing at each role they played. Dennis Quaid played a Secret Service Agent who protected the president from a previous assassination attempt years ago and ultimately ended up traumatized. On his first day back to the job, a successful attempt was made on his watch, and he felt the need to solve this case.Although Quaid's performance was great, Forest Whitaker takes the best-actor's award as he plays a tourist who falls in the middle of the action.This whole movie was thrilling, suspenseful and interesting which led to an action packed ending with the best cinematography I have seen in years (you will all know the mouth dropping camera work I am talking about when you see the movie).9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sophisticated Concept Muddied by Dense Incredible Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although fast moving and generally entertaining, this Kurosawa-wannabe is occasionally confusing and often preposterous. Dramatizing a terrorist attack and presidential assassination from multiple points of view is a sophisticated technique that dates back as least as far as "Rashomon" and its subsequent U.S. remake, "The Outrage." However, those earlier films depicted a fairly straight-forward event, which was subsequently complicated by retelling it from the perspective of others. "Vantage Point" strives to up the ante by increasing the number of points of view. Unfortunately, the film also relates an impenetrably dense plot and involves so many disparate characters that the story would be confusing even if it were related in chronological order, let alone in fractured time.Although such stellar performers as Dennis Quaid, Sigourney Weaver, Forest Whitaker, William Hurt, and Matthew Fox are on screen, the frenetic editing does not allow any of them to register as a character. However, together with a large cast of Latino actors, the recognizable stars help keep the plot threads clear, while the film jumps back and forth in time. Unfortunately, the rewind device that illustrates that time once again has jumped back to high noon is overused and eventually becomes tedious. Once would have been enough to let the audience in on the plot mechanics. Even "Memento" did not beat the audience over the head with its reverse-time concept.However, if viewers can suspend logic for 90 minutes, "Vantage Point" will hold their attention with its pace and action. Unfortunately, if they ponder the film afterward and begin to discuss the gaping plot holes, which multiply as the movie progresses, the flimsy support that holds up the action will crumble into nonsense. Viewers must accept countless failures in background checks and security sweeps; the evident unfamiliarity of world leaders with each other; terrorists who will kill indiscriminately, but show mercy at a critical moment; and any number of coincidental encounters in a crowded panicked city. Yes, "Vantage Point" is slick, sometimes pulse-pounding entertainment. However, despite high aspirations, the film's credibility is shaky. "In the Line of Fire" covered similar territory in a less complicated, less flashy style and had both action and intelligence. Despite an intriguing premise and talented direction, in "Vantage Point," less would have been more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 Strangers. 8 Points of View. 1 Truth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point is the story of eight strangers with eight different points of view each trying to piece together the truth behind an assassination attempt on the president of the United States.I just got back seeing this film and let me tell you now, this is not a film for everyone. Another thing, avoid seeing any TV spots and trailers for this film (although the reason you want to see this in the first place was because you were interested in the trailer). The reason is that the trailer basically gives you one good twist and many others. One of those trailers that gives everything away, you know?There are two types of thrillers: One that makes people use their heads with not so many action scenes, and the other is a one with car chases, shootouts, and many other action scenes. This film is both.I'm sure people will have to disagree with me on this one: I liked the style of the film. It's really crafty with all of the perspectives and rewinding back to the beginning and doing it all over again. Why do I like that? I don't know. I just do. The other set of people will give a huge sigh after each perspective. I understand that people may be annoyed after the third or fourth rewind scene to the beginning of the film again.Fortunately or unfortunately, this happens only five times. After that, it's an average movie. You get the car chase, shootouts, cliffhangers; you get basically everything you want from an adrenaline-filled thriller. Most of the performances were decent. The only one that actually stuck out was Forest Whitaker (no surprise there).In some ways, this film may be predictable. Yes, each points of views give you something new each time and the action scenes were great! If you are one of those people looking for a well-crafted thriller without being overly-complicated, this is the film to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When bad scripts happen to good actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure talented actors like Whitaker, Noriega, Weaver, Hurt, et al signed up for this project, they did so thinking the same we did when we watched the trailer. "Sounds like a good movie" and, in theory, it should be. The idea of having the different perspectives of the situation depicted in the film has great potential. However, Vantage Point fails in almost every aspect. 8 perspectives in 90 minutes is too much, specially in this circumstances. As a consequence, most, if not all, of the characters are extremely under developed. They could've had any c-lister playing most of these characters and viewers wouldn't have noticed much difference. There is no motivation given for any of these people's actions nor is there any logic to the things being said or to pretty much anything else. I don't want to go into specifics to avoid spoilers, but all I can say is that, the only impressive thing about Vantage Point is that it manages to repeat the same story 8 times while saying nothing at all... all there is vague references to pre-made political slogans that lead to no conclusion or message or anything!

		<shortDescription>Montage of confusion. Good try, but no cigar.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has an interesting format and a good story. The movie also contains good performances. Generally, I liked the movie, but (yes, the proverbial "but") after a while the movie became repetitive because of the repeated utilization of flashbacks. This movie is the king of the flashbacks. If you do not like movies with flashbacks, then stay away from this movie. I don't know of another movie where flashbacks are more extensively employed. The problem with flashbacks is that, when improperly placed, they interrupt the continuity of a movie and muddle the storyline. The story has to move forward otherwise the movie, like an airplane that loses speed in flight, stalls. And that is what happens in this movie. Also, this is not one of William Hurt's better movies. However, many of the supporting actors give strong performances but ultimately the movie cannot sustain what is a promising start.One feature of this movie deserves special note. Although probably not intended as such, this movie contains one of the funniest car chase scenes in the history of Hollywood. The car chase is so ridiculous that it provokes laughter and adds to the movie's already baffling montage of confusion.By the way, if you like watching scenes of bombs and mayhem shown over and over again, this movie will be perfect for you. Imagine watching the initial D-Day invasion scenes in Saving Private Ryan ten times from ten different perspectives. Watching it once is enough.Another negative is the Sigourney Weaver's relegation to an almost minor role. A great actress like Ms. Weaver deserves better. Another case of miscasting, but what else is new?Now, let me get back to the car chase. Sometimes a car chase adds to the story, but this is one time when a car chase, especially one that is shown over and over again and from different angles, is just plain dumb. And when the movie throws in a little girl into the vehicular mess, you know that the movie can now claim one more victim - originality. Where is Hopalong Cassidy when we need him? Or Roy Rogers? Or Gene Autry? Or the Lone Ranger?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer I thought it looked great, then the more I heard about it closer to its release and the bad reviews made me think "maybe not", but I saw it this evening and thought it was great. Sure it had its corny moments but then today almost all action movies do. The concept of it I think is great and it is really well executed. My biggest complaint is the Forest Whitaker storyline which is just completely unnecessary and had too many coincidences in it. There is one long 20-30 minute action sequence near the end which is incredible. Some of the twists were predictable and others I liked. The pacing was amazing the first 2 stories were a little slow then the rest of the movie felt like less then an hour. People in the theater kept moaning every time the story reset but did they not know what kind of movie they were seeing or something? Ignorant people like that just annoy me. So in my opinion disregard the reviews and all the negative talk and see it for yourself. Some parts you will chuckle but others will have your heart pounding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS INCLUDED**** I saw this movie on opening night very anxious to what I thought was going to be a Bourne-esquire sortof thriller. Instead - I walked away from this movie puzzled about how silly it was. The rewinding thing was definitely annoying with the movie crowd moaning every time it happened. I understand why it needed to be a part of the story, but they could have done it in a Pupl-Fiction sort of way, which was much more imaginative and compelling instead of seeing the same thing over and over again.The movie indicates that the audience could help figure out the true plot, but everything unravels for the bad guys due to a coincidence discovered by the main character. WTF?! And then at the end, when it just so happens the ambulance crashes right in front of Quaid and guess who's in the back? WTF?! The terrorist who had no problem assassinating the president, blowing up a square full of people, jeopardizes his entire mission so he doesn't run over a little girl? WTF? There are many holes/discrepancies that didn't sit well with me and I think they could have done a lot better than this. I find myself venturing out to the movies less and less and this movie has me going back to hanging out with my friends at the local pub. Better use of my money. Silly film. Wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing Violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the worst movies in the past few years. Repeat violence and so fast moving it made me dizzy. Why the actors put themselves in this bad movie is beyond understanding. The car chase was not to be believed. Making this movie was a total waste. The repeating of the scene of the presidential killing was boring and nerve racking. Good actors bad movie. The car chase was way too long. The ending was a let down. It was almost as though they ran out of gas. I go to the movies on a regular basis. This has to be one of the most disappointing movies I have seen. Explosions,killings,car chases,very little meaningful dialogue. No stars for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting ACTION Film--Wonderful Concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm very confused--a friend told me this movie has had horrible reviews, and I see a 7 out of 10 on IMDb ratings--yet every review I read on IMDb says "excellent." And this movie was indeed excellent--saw it 2 days ago with a friend. I was so immediately excited by the movie that it combined with my Coke to start giving me my first anxiety attack in 20 years. What a movie beginning!! I put the Coke and my popcorn down on the floor and didn't touch them the entire movie. Other reviewers say the film repeats itself 5 or 8 times--actually it seems like 500 times. But you start WANTING to see the repetitions so you can help the Secret Service solve the bizarre happenings. And in the process of the repetitions, a tremendous, wildly exciting film unfolds and evolves. I also heard groans from the audience as the "repeats" kept coming, so, if you are not an intelligent person, if you like everything spoon-fed to you nicely like some calm video game, or if you are a childish person, you will not like this movie. This film is only for those who love to be blown away by non-stop action and constantly twisting plot. Might have been the sound system, but I have never heard explosions this loud in my life--loved the sound. And after seeing this movie, I have a new respect for what cellphones can do, I have new respect for what our troops face abroad, and I'm going to be extra-careful whom I TRUST! My advice? Forget the ratings and reviews and go see this film--but you won't have time to eat popcorn or drink Coke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spain? you sure? One of the best car chases in the movies since Ronin, seriously spoiled by the choice of filming locations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever been to Salamanca, Spain? Well, don't think for a second this film is going to show you anything about that city. It would be more credible if the producers had chosen to locate the story in Salamanca, Guanajuato, Mexico. The plot is kinda OK, there's action, there's enough suspense and there's a car chase, which should be enough to say it's a fairly good movie. But it isn't. Not even close. First, you see images of a certain Plaza Mayor and the president arriving in a limousine, when there's no way in hell a limousine could run through the inner streets of Salamanca, which are for pedestrian use only. But OK, so far the environment looks Spanish enough... except all the extras are Mexican. Then you get that awesome car chase running around endless two way streets with very colorful colonial houses, just like the downtown of the Mexican city of Cuernavaca, and not the beautiful quarry buildings and extremely narrow and edgy streets of Salamanca. Then there's the huge freeways, Mexican taxis and buses on the background... and the "photochop" at the end with the view from Salamanca and the huge freeway bridges is just plain ugly. Seriously, the city of Salamanca should sue the producers for making their city look so bad, that's called defamation. This is the XXI century, one would think they could make a movie more credible this days, right? At least the new Rambo beats at that... it's filmed in Thailand, does look like Burma, and people that are supposed to get killed really end up looking dead enough. And I'm not even going to talk about all the weirdness in the sequences. Shame on you, Pete Travis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Synopsis) President Ashton (William Hurt) is attending a global war on terror summit in Spain. Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Matthew Fox) are two of the Secret Service agents assigned to protect him. This is the first action that Agent Barnes has been in since he took a bullet for President Ashton six-month earlier. We really don't know if Agent Barnes is up to the challenge of protecting the President. Shortly after President Ashton is escorted to the stage in the plaza by the Secret Service, he is immediately shot twice by a rifle from a window and falls to the floor. The crowd is in shock and chaos breaks out all over, especially, when bombs begin to explode. Howard Lewis (Forest Whitaker) is an American video-taping the event to show to his children that he was actually there at this historic event. He believes that he has the picture of the man who shot the President. Agent Barnes sees the tape and has a clue to that person. Several different people witness the event, and only through their eyes do we see the truth behind the assassination attempt.(My Comment) The movie is an action packed thriller with a wild and sometimes terrifying car chase. The movie tells the same story in time from 8 different perspectives from what each character encountered 23 minutes prior to the shots that rang out in the plaza, and then about 20 minutes after that through a series of flashbacks. The way they started the flashback each time starts to be a little silly after the third time, but it is fun for the audience to laugh at. This is another "camera shaking around", movie which it does during the running and car chase scenes. The movie itself gives you the realistic feelings of actually being there. The story is not predicable in what came next, and you will not figure out the true ending. Dennis Quaid was excellent in playing the part of Agent Barnes. The only thing in the story that I couldn't believe was how so many Secret Service agents were taken out by one man when they were on high alert at the hotel.

Halfway though it the whole audience was laughing at this piece of crap they called a movie. Im not going to even comment about the idiotic idea of showing the same twenty minutes over and over because i think by now everyone realizes its a stupid. The acting was bad, the dialog was bad, the script was horrible, the set looked like it belonged in a high school play, the story was laughable, even the extras sucked. It was just so ....there's not even a word to describe what it was.

		<fullReview>This movie is not for anyone who has ever been to an event with presidential level security. Or anyone who has ever thought about what such an event might be like for longer than, say, 35 seconds, which would be more thought than the writer and director of "Vantage Point" put into it.This movie is not for anyone who is a cop, has ever talked to a cop, or has ever watched a really good cop movie.You would like this movie if you are completely fascinated by conspiracy theories, to the point of suspending all other filters on your belief system.You would also like this movie if you are just interested in completely, absolutely mindless - but pretty - flickering pictures on a big screen. This may make some people reading this think "Oh good, a fun action movie." Well... not really. For comparison, this movie makes a movie like "Live Free or Die Hard" seem well-researched and painstakingly realistic.You would also like this movie if you enjoy seeing movies where the entire audience laughs at inappropriate times.To be fair, the cinematography is quite good. And there is something about the movie that keeps your attention. Despite numerous groans, much intellectual discomfort and a constantly building feeling of outrage that accompanies a director repeatedly insulting your intelligence, my wife and I never got the urge to leave the theater.</fullReview>

Many people in the theater started to groan after they started to show the event from about the third different point of view. I personally thought the idea of showing you the event from the many different point of views was clever. You do not find out who did it until about the last "vantage point" and all the other "vantage points" stop right before you see who did it, which keeps you in suspense throughout the whole movie. You may be shocked who did it, because i know that i was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is such a monumental failure on so many levels I wonder what company those other reviewers really work for. Interesting idea to tell a story from eight vantage points - as long as they're not the same vantage point! This films fails in so many ways that it is a real wonder if the studio execs ever saw a print before release. The real problem is that the eight perspectives of the 'event' are all from people that were at the same place &amp; time and the audience must suffer through eight dull recounts of the same story with the added bonus of a little piece of the puzzle thrown in at the very end of the eight separate segments. This breaks the cardinal rule of entertainment which is "Don't bore your audience". If you want to tell the same story eight times either tell it from completely different perspectives, or different locations. The problem was that every one of the characters, except one were at the same place. After the third recount the audience started to laugh at the ridiculous idea that they would have to suffer through another segment of the same event once more. You could hear were groans as the cheap rewinding 'device' played. This was the movies main problem. Other issues include complete lack of direction of actors or just plain poor direction, lack of any realism as far as government security agency procedures(i.e. the secret service), believable or at least interesting characters ( I picked out the 'surprise' heavy immediately), even the focus on some shots! (I'm talking about static MED &amp; CUs) The film was dreck. I want my money back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling screenplay and plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Columbia Pictures' Vantage Point introduces a new and unconventional take on the action/thriller genre. The multi-viewpoint perspective introduces a fresh form of story telling. The plot revolves around eight witnesses with eight different points of view trying to unlock the truth behind an assassination attempt on the President of the United States.While in Spain at a landmark peace summit against the global war on terror, President Aston faces a life-threatening assault as he takes to the stage. This is followed by a huge blast killing hundreds. Throughout the movie, one revisits this event through the eyes of several witnesses with their own set of stories and experiences. The story rewinds multiple times, each time portraying a new perspective. As you feel that the plot is clearing up, there is yet another dimension added to it and you realize that nothing is what it seems to be. However, after 3-4 occurrences of rewinds, one might get bored seeing the technique monotonously and the upcoming rewinds often become expected. One's patience drops as the story keeps revolving on the same scene instead of moving ahead.The experience is like putting a puzzle together, piece by piece, but just when you think you have figured out the real scene, the entire scenario changes. It is beautiful to see how the various events described throughout converge to the same point. The innovative way of story telling and the clean editing surely deserves commendation. Have a little patience, and you will be enthralled by the engrossing mystery that slowly unwinds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vantage Point is an intelligent thriller. It is a new, unconventional take on the action-thriller genre. The movie is a giant puzzle, you are clueless at first as to what is going on. But as movie proceeds, everything starts making sense. The movie adopted a fresh and unconventional form of story telling. It jumps right into moment of action followed by eight different perspectives. Although, it may not cater to tastes of some people. The story of the movie revolves around President of U.S. But center of the plot is a guilt ridden secret service man (he took a bullet for the President) who wants redemption for some reason, even though he's a hero. For me the most interesting part of the movie was the way different stories with same start and end points get woven into each other with each story. The director of the movie Pete Travis has put in some hard work and given an extraordinary piece of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>U.S. President Ashton (William Hurt) is in Spain for a counter terrorism summit. Before he can begin a speech, he is felled by an assassins' bullet. But is that what really happened? The gimmick of this political action-thriller is that ultimately we get several different perspectives on the events leading up to the event, the event itself, and the tumult that follows. We see things through the eyes of a Secret Service agent (Dennis Quaid), a tourist (Forest Whitaker), a Spanish cop (Eduardo Noriega), the terrorists themselves, and a man being made to assist the terrorists because they've kidnapped his brother.This is all really quite senseless. The final third is almost wall to wall action, and it becomes so over the top, with Quaid turning into an indestructible superhero, that it eventually loses its way. The multiple stories do help to make it reasonably absorbing. Director Pete Travis and especially the top notch veteran film editor Stuart Baird do their able best to keep a hold of our attention. This thing moves so damn fast (and clocks in at just over an hour and a half), that Travis and Baird are able to distract some viewers from the more ridiculous aspects of Barry L. Levy's script. On location shooting in Mexico and slick widescreen photography help to make things watchable.Certainly some of the actors give this everything that they've got, performing with admirably straight faces. Joining Hurt, Quaid, and Whitaker are Matthew Fox, Bruce McGill, Edgar Ramirez, Said Taghmaoui, Zoe Saldana, James Le Gros, and Sigourney Weaver.These filmmakers may well keep their viewers on their toes throughout, but eventually the whole thing just becomes silly. Some of the plot twists are reasonably amusing, and all in all "Vantage Point" is able to run on a fair bit of adrenaline.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vantage Point is a fast-paced dramatic suspense thriller. Its editing pattern and storytelling make viewing the film a very engaging and enjoyable experience. The story told might be more or less like other good suspense thrillers, but combined with the Way it is told they make a killer movie. The film is based around an assassination attempt on a United States president and is shown from 8 different perspectives of the characters involved. As each perspective is shown, the viewer unravels newer portions or the story. The best part of the story-telling is that as the viewer watches each perspective, he/she is slowly able to put all the puzzle pieces together and understand the big picture. The cast is made up of substantial famous actors such as Dennis Quaid starring as Agent Thomas Barnes, the very pleasant-looking Sigourney Weaver as the director of a news broadcast show, Forest Whitaker as a tourist in a wonderful and fun-to-watch role; and not- so-famous ones such as Zoe Saldanha (the now famous, new sensation from Avatar), Spanish actor Eduardo Noriega and Mathew Fox from Lost. But all in all it is made up of good looking people which constitute in making you want to watch the film. The cinematography is amazingly skilled and accomplished. Look out for the cinematography during the car scenes. All in all, an extremely entertaining film and a must-watch. I give it a 6-7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: It's a historical day. In Salamanca there is a big summit with leaders from around the world with the intention to form a broad coalition against terrorism. But when the President of the United States has given his speech the unthinkable happen. He is shot. There are a lot of witnesses, besides the terrorists and the Secret Service. And everyone has their own vantage point, their own story to tell.Comments: A very nice idea, that they pulled of pretty good I think. The original idea to have several different vantage points and sub-stories around the same event brings both good things and some not so good. The good is that every story is a piece of the puzzle. The intensity and suspense are there all along, from the very beginning to the very end. And that's because with each and every story something little more, something unknown are revealed. That brings quite a lot of twists and turns, so the story can be regarded told at a high pace. The story is very engaging and kept me totally interested all the way.On the other hand, in another way the story is a little slow. And that's because there are rather many different vantage points to show. And as we rewind and start over frequently the main story get a little stalled. There is a question of what will happen next that take a very long time answering. There is also some irritating but in the overall picture minor plot holes. The car chase is a little odd even if it is exciting. Barnes car seem indestructible and it is odd that two cars can run amok in a city that has just seen a terrorist attack without anyone getting suspicious. The ending is also a little abrupt and do not keep in line with the rest of the movie.Unfortunately the movie does shoot itself in the foot by presenting a completely unbelievable cover up story right at the very end. The official story is that there was only a lone attacker. That's hard to make plausible as there was obviously and very publicly two separate locations that were attacked. Why do that? The cast is impressive. A lot of known actors turn up. Quaid is good in the lead, but also look out for Forest Whitaker, Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Bruce McGill and Zoe Saldana, among others. Ayelet Zurer was an unknown for me but a pleasant new acquaintance.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billed and, for the first 45 mins, playing out as a puzzlebox thriller this is a bit of a snorefest. The acting is phoned in and the direction flails wildly, trying to re-direct our attention so we don't accidentally get the twists before they happen. Well, no worries there - I was so busy hiding behind the sofa from the dreadful contributions of Zoe Saldana, the preposterously underused Sigourney Weaver and "Oscar Winner" Forest Whitaker that I couldn't have cared less.Then something truly remarkable happens. Clearly Pete Travis loses faith in his own movie and abandons the hopeless chopped-up narrative. Amazingly this coincides with the first appearance of the redoubtable Bruce McGill, who could be credited with galvanising everyone around him (in tandem with William Hurt, the A-list on this week's Presidential rota). Dennis Quaid's twitchy Presidential bullet-taker recovers himself to help create one of the better car chases I've seen for a while. There are considerable loose ends which simply end up scattered across the end of the picture like so many bodies or vehicles but at least the final half hour delivers the sort of thrills you cough up for. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsuccessful 'real time' thriller that doesn't work out quite how it should</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning President Ashton (William Hurt) appears in Spain to give a speech. However, his presence has attracted as much negative publicity as good, with a mob of enraged anti-war protesters circling him and threatening to kick off any moment. He is eventually shot and shortly afterwards, two huge explosions go off. The film shows the moment from several different perspectives, most notably that of Presidential Bodyguard Barnes (Dennis Quaid), who tries to track the shooter. As events play out, we see things unravel in a way no-one could quite have expected them to.Torn from today's headlines, with a pro war president and the defiant response from his critics, Vantage Point also tries to re-invigorate the 'real time' thriller, where events play out in the manner of real life, used before in such film's as Johnny Depp's Nick of Time. Aside from Quiad and Hurt, it also has a stronger supporting cast, including Matthew Fox, Forest Whitaker and Sigourney Weaver. But although all the right ingredients are there, the results are sadly disappointing.For starters, everyone seems to be on wooden alert, with poor acting from Quaid, Whitaker, Hurt and everyone else really. It's not as if the material wasn't strong enough for them, so they should all hang their heads in shame. While this is an interesting concept and watching the outcome unravel to the end is thrilling and surprising, for much of the time the key scene replaying again and again ends up making it a rather boring affair that nulls tension rather than enlivens it. Surely enough, it doesn't flow as smoothly as the director probably wanted it and by the end the story has taken enough preposterous turns to make you scratch your head in disbelief.Not awful, but sadly a bit disappointing. **</fullReview>

When a director tries to cross the limits of a mediocre thriller/action typical Hollywood movie as Pete Travis intended to it is not enough just to rewind backward the story for 10 times! The end is so typically 'Hollywoodish' that it made me feel sorry for the time that I wasted, not watching the film, but expecting something ad least a bit different. The film is awfully full with prejudices and stereotyping that it really makes me seek! The perfect terrorist attack was ruined by the conscience of the most vicious terrorist that killed hundreds of innocent people in the last than 30 minutes. I don't think so! He could just run over the girl, and it would all make sense! But no! The Americans had to win again! It is not about the good or the evil at all! In the end this film is nothing more then a 'hard to believe in' story about an all American hero saving the day(or the American president, whatever)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A linear plot for a nonlinear tagline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the previews and synopsis would have you believe that this movie is shown in a nonlinear style, it is actually quite the opposite. And for such this comes down to the key necessity: Subtlety. This movie lacks of any such kind.They attempt the overused "rewind effect" to try to deliver the plot from 8 points of view, however in each rewind only a little bit more of the plot is revealed, most of which is something that happens after the end of the previous rewind anyway. They fill in the gap to the next plot point mostly with pointless filler and repeat footage from the same exact angle you saw it before. And about 3/4 of the way through the movie they just throw their rewind effect right out the window and go back to the more traditional linear character switching to deliver the remainder of the plot. The movie completely relies upon cut-off scenes that end by not showing something vital. Very cheap suspense.The only saving grace of the movie was the action. Very well acted, and choreographed (well, with the exception of the car chase). And the explosions and chaos well done. I only really wished for more subtlety in plot lines, because, well... once the movie was over, that was it. There was nothing more to the movie than what they plainly showed you. The plot itself was not even remotely believable. And I left the movie feeling cheated.Hope you enjoy it more than I did.</fullReview>

Although there's different witnesses, T.V. news crew (Led by Sigourney Weaver) or people from the secret service all seen something very different from their point of views. Now this characters have to do put the pieces together... why the President of the United States is killed but not everything in this day is what it seems to be.Directed by Pete Travis made an entertaining thriller with some clever suspenseful moments and better than average action sequences. The best thing about "Vantage Point" is the strong cast with Dennis Quaid, Oscar-Winner:Forest Whitaker, Matthew Fox, Edgar Ramirez, Said Taghmaoui, the stunningly sexy Ayelet Zurer and others. The first-rate cast in the feature made it better than it should have been. While the premise by first-time screenwriter Peter Levy is good. But it does gets boring after awhile, especially the story always retold but done is different ways from the point of view from the characters and it gets very gimmicky quickly as well.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also includes an running commentary track by the director, three interesting featurette and a small gag featurette with the filmmaker. "Vantage Point" was the sleeper Box Office Hit, when it was release in the winter of 2008. For sure, the critics were truly had a mixed blessing with this movie and some audiences felt it was boring as well. "Vantage Point" is certainly ambitious Hollywood movie and it is well made but i wish... the screenplay could have been much better. It is worth a look. Super 35. (***/*****).</fullReview>

Have you been to Salamanca... for researching purposes? I do not think so. The Spanish from Spain it is different from the Spanish from other American countries, the accent, the expressions,the character, the way of living, customs... everything is different. You can depict one or two foreigners (the girl and her mother, maybe a Mexican) as in Spain there are quite a lot of people from abroad who have their culture, their language... but we would like to see, at least, one person from Salamanca, or just from Spain and hearing the right way of talking (Spanish or English (with Spanish accent)), the right customs, the right atmosphere. Having said this, the film is OK for being watched and enjoyed once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vantage Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer and the clips on Jonathan Ross, I thought this was a film I could definitely enjoy, but I did wonder why it was only given two out of five stars, now I know. Basically you see the same scene about four-five times, the shooting of President Ashton (William Hurt) - although you find out later it is actually a lookalike, and the real President gets kidnapped - and you see it from the point of view, aka Vantage Point, of eight characters. First is TV producer Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver) who catches an important suspect on film, second agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid) who will spot this suspect, third is a man involved Javier (Edgar Ramirez), fourth is tourist Howard Lewis (Forest Whitaker) who sees more than he realises on his video camera, and the last few minutes see a mix of all characters involved, and it turns out there is a traitor in Baren's partner Kent Taylor (Lost's Matthew Fox) and a blackmailing. Also starring Ayelet Zurer as Veronica, Sa?d Taghmaoui as Suarez and Eduardo Noriega as Enrique. The way this film is put together in the same style as a Japanese film called Rashomon, although I personally have seen it done in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, and quite a clever style it is. Yes, it is a tiny bit annoying seeing the same scene four to five times, but the points of view add some good twists, the cast of well known actors makes for good viewing, and there are some explosions and a chase sequence to keep you interested, oh, and finding out who is involved in the shooting. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vantage Point was poised on the edge of being a great movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And then it lost its balance, windmilled its arms, and fell flat on its butt, looking vaguely silly.The pacing of this movie is great. The telling of the same action from everyone's point of view, Rashomon-like, actually worked pretty well. There wasn't too much overlap, and the same material wasn't shown over and over (at least, not too much). This device really made it feel like these events were happening at breakneck speed. Definitely the movie's strongest point.The acting was pretty good. No real standouts as being either terrific or terrible. Impressively unnoticeable. The cinematography was actually very good. One of the better-looking movies (without everything being CGI) that I've seen in a long time, despite the well-founded problems in location confusion (Mexico isn't Spain).The basic problem with the movie, aside from some plot holes that detracted a bit from the film's effectiveness, was that the plot itself was simultaneously overly complex, and yet never fleshed out properly. If the movie were a painting, it would be something very, very busy, but lacking in depth and detail.Interesting, entertaining, but ultimately implausible and not particularly satisfying.Worth a rent. I might even buy it... in a few years... when it's cheap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Recycling is Great For the Environment But It's Not For the Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's the point of using a cinematic storytelling gimmick that's already been used to much more powerful effect, especially when your initial story is a stale, used, recycled political assassination yarn with nothing new brought to the table? The U.S. president is participating in an anti-terrorism conference. Over a twenty-minute period, an assassination attempt unfolds. The film loops through this period over and over, each time from the point of view of a different character, adding a new piece to the larger puzzle with each vignette.Picture this story by itself, along with its saint-hearted bystander, haunted Secret Service agent, mysterious foreigners, the twist, the car chase, and the shootouts. It's all well and good, but it's a found poem of a movie. It's the skeleton of a thriller formula that hides behind the attention-grabber of the multiple viewpoint "Rashomon effect." Rashomon, De Palma's Snake Eyes, Van Sant's Elephant, and others have employed this device, Rashomon being the originator, and despite how good each movie is, they each tell a new story, or at least a new variation on an old story. Vantage Point, despite an interesting moment here and there, is the same old tired action thriller.Even the cast seems tired, though it's pleasant to face the presence of stars that don't seem to work so much anymore, like Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt. Dennis Quaid phones in, and Forest Whitaker is good within the confines of his dull role. I will admit though that the action, which again I've seen before, is intense, and the twists have a fleeting inkling of surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Clever Treatise on Nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read a number of comparisons here to other films like Groundhog Day, but this movie reminded me a lot more of Rashomon (thank you film class). In that picture, several characters recalled a rape/murder and their differing points of view offered insight into what we accept as "truth." Each version contradicted its predecessor's in important ways. In the end, it was left to us to make up our own mind. That's what my professor said anyhow.All these years later, along comes Vantage Point, which steals the basic idea and adds lots of gunfire and explosions. Not that I don't like gunfire and explosions. They're fine by me. But I like to have characters too. Vantage Point just has cardboard cutouts running about, with the villains being the worst of the lot. They seem to have no purpose other than to kill secret service agents. And when they run out of them, to kill each other. I guess they want to kidnap the president too, but their reasons are never made clear. They're so intent on doing it, though, that they have kidnapped other people to force their participation. Huh? I could be totally off the mark, of course. Maybe there's a clever political statement being made about Spain, which is where the story takes place. I don't think I am though and here's why: never once do the bad guys assign any kind of motive to their behavior. Nor do the Americans, for that matter. It's almost as if the filmmakers invented a generic terrorist "evil" to fill plot loopholes and motivate mayhem?.kind of like the U.S. government.Wait a second. Maybe there is a point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Repetitive and hollow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about the assassination of the American President seen through various perspectives.The assassination is a momentary scene. So how to expand it to a full length film? Tell the same thing many times. In "Vantage Point", this single event is told many times over from different observer perspectives. In order to fill up even more screen time, many car chases and double crossing agents are added in. However, all these plot twists are not as interesting as it sounds. The result is a repetitive, hollow action film which has little suspense. Plainly, I found it not so captivating, even at times boring. And the hotel explosion scene is so obviously a computer generated. Could they have at least made it more real?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really lots of action, but the movie turns out to be a bit unrealistic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the setting, there is a gathering of officials from 150 countries as a plan for counter-terrorism and peace. The USA President (POTUS) is one of the dignitaries and he is appearing shortly after Noon to address the audience in an open square. His usual band of Secret Service mean are there.Dennis Quaid is actually the lead character as Thomas Barnes, who we learn had taken a bullet to protect POTUS maybe a year earlier, and today he is back on the job, not sure if he can put his demons behind him.The action starts right away, as two gun shots ring out, the POTUS is hit and down, and chaos follows. Shortly there is an explosion away from the crowd, then there is an explosion right where the POTUS had been, while he was being taken to an ambulance.The movie gets its title from replaying the 25 minutes up to the explosion 6 or 7 times, showing different vantage points and the observations of different people. The real challenge was to film this in a way to keep the story straight, and it all does come together.A good movie for those who like almost non-stop action, including some pretty action-packed car chase scenes. Filmed mostly in and around Mexico City.SPOILERS: As we learn, body doubles had been used for the POTUS since Reagan, and today a double was in the square because US intelligence had picked up communications that it would not be safe. But the terrorists were one step ahead, they knew the real POTUS would be in the hotel observing from a distance, and they arranged to have him kidnapped after killing all his men one by one. A rogue US agent was in on it, and in the end it was up to Barnes to figure everything out and track down the bad guys and retrieve the POTUS. In a very bad crash near the end, Barnes crawls out of the smashed windshield, and I almost expected to hear, "Here I come to save the day!", the Mighty Mouse theme. He, in fact, saves the day and proves that he is ready to assume his former duties. What a test!! Matthew Fox was the rogue agent Kent Taylor. Forest Whitaker was the tourist Howard Lewis who provided key information from his videotape. Sigourney Weaver is Rex Brooks who is heading the on location broadcast by GNN. And William Hurt is President Ashton, and also plays Ashton's double.</fullReview>

The action is filled with plot twists. The riding throughout Spain can be compared to the famous chase scene of "The French Connection."After this one hour of repetition, everything is tied in to make quite a neat thriller.

		<shortDescription>I can't exactly tell which side it takes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Vantage Point" portrays an assassination attempt on the US president (William Hurt) during a trip to Salamanca, Spain. The first half of the movie consists of the viewpoints of several people present at the event: a bodyguard (Dennis Quaid), a tourist (Forest Whitaker), a newswoman (Sigourney Weaver), and a Spaniard (Eduardo Noriega) fearing for his life. The combination of these viewpoints eventually lay everything out.This was certainly an interesting idea for a movie. What I'm not sure about is the movie's specific position. It portrays the president going to Spain to praise the prime minister's participation in the so-called War on Terrorism. Needless to say, driving through the city, the president passes hoards of protesters calling him the world's #1 terrorist and things like that. Therefore, I can't tell whether the movie promotes the War on Terrorism or opposes it. If the movie opposes it, wouldn't it be better to focus on what the Middle East has become due to the war? If the movie supports it, then...well, does any movie really want to support it? Whatever the position, it's still an interesting idea for a movie. Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>too many vantage points are frustrating...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As others have suggested, vantage point wud be a gud return on your money if you went to see a thriller with action sequences, blasts, car chases and a lot of shattering glass.Vantage point is a story of an assassination attempt on US president from 8 different viewpoint, each revealing something new about the events. This repetitive nature of the plot gets frustrating after a while. The concept worked for run lola run but a thriller like vantage point is supposed to go forward not rewind itself 8 times.If u are in the theater to enjoy a thriller and not bother about the plot, well n gud, you would come out a lot happier. But if you expected anything more then the loose storyline would really disappoint you.The writers have a lot of explaining to do. If any of the people responsible for a US presidents security would have watched this movie then the writers are in a real soup. just 7 guys guarding the presidential suit, with outsiders having access to the hotel and a local guy working as bell boy (who easily sneaks in guns and explosives into the hotel), a single guy wiping out each of the agents (even rambo would hv had a hard time at that). At the venue where the president gets shot the bad guys are able to sneak in a remote controlled fan and gun right under the nose of the secret service.then no one bothers to explain why gud guys were blackmailed to assist the plot when the same thing would have been easier with dedicated bad guys, the role of the rouge camera man, role of the rouge secret service guy, he risked his life just to retrieve the gun (I don't think the bad guys were that pressed on funds that they needed to retrieve the assassination weapon), massive car chases on 2 lane streets, at times even going the wrong way, colossal explosions sparing the lives of just the important members of the cast.well all in all a very mediocre thriller</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey guys, first time reviewer here. No spoilers, just want to share some thoughts I have after having finished watching this. This 'Rashômon' style story unfolds during a political summit and we follow it from the different perspectives of the numerous characters it brings together. My feelings for this movie are not that hard to put in words. I found it somewhat entertaining, although bland most of the way through. The cinematography was top notch, as you would expect from a big budget movie; the actors were decent at most; the basic idea of the execution is nice; the pacing is good; but the plot was made too easy to follow and gave you some details on a platter, even though the subtext already hinted in a certain direction. I would not say it's a bad movie, but have a lot of popcorn ready to get over some of the developments.All in all, Vantage Point is entertaining, if you don't question it very much.P.S. My rating system:5 and below - don't waste your time; 6 - the movie can be entertaining; to you, if you like the genre/like the actor/don't expect much of it; 7 - high chances of it being entertaining to the majority of people; 8 - everybody will have a good time watching this; 9 - this movie is nearly flawless and probably among best in genre; 10 - absolute genre-defining masterpiece</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No character development kills a unique idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world lives in a dangerous time and, if we believe the media and our politicians, there are threats everywhere we look. Vantage Point tries to copy that feeling with a unique mode of story telling. The problem, though, is that while the idea of multiple sub-plots being brought in together for a final conclusion is a good one, Vantage Point is actually a movie will little plot or character at all.President Ashton (William Hurt) is in Spain for a world summit on terrorism. His Secret Service detail includes Agent Kent Taylor (Matthew Fox) and Agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid). Barnes in particular is well known for his past actions which resulted in him taking a bullet from the president during an earlier assassination attempt. However, the experience has left him shaken and only Taylor's good word keeps him on this assignment. Also in Spain are several other random individuals who, if it were not for the events that are soon about to take place, would never cross each other's path. GNN employee Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver), American tourist Howard Lewis (Forest Whitaker), and Spanish police officer Enrique (Eduardo Noriega), are about to cross paths in ways they never thought possible until that day.Vantage Point tells the story of the attempted assassination and bombings through both major and minor characters such as those listed above. The problem is that Vantage Point moves around so fast to each character that it spends no time on developing these characters. We discover that Agent Taylor is actually a traitor though we never learn why. A special forces soldier named Javier (Edgar Ramirez) is trying to save his brother by helping the terrorists though we never learn how his brother was kidnapped. Howard's role is actually pointless and who unfortunately takes up too much time which would have been better off spent on the major characters who are actually interesting. The terrorists themselves, including their goals, are also a mystery and we never learn exactly what it was they were trying to accomplish.There isn't much to say about Vantage Point. The idea of combining different points of view is interesting but a better movie would have limited the amount of times this is done in order to spend more time developing the story itself. Explosions, gun fights, and car chases are great but if they have no real meaning then who cares? 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>propagandistic, but as a thriller this one is pretty intense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first of all i had NEVER watched a trailer for this( i never do as a matter of fact), neither looked up reviews other then the tag line. so i was not having huge expectations or any influences. i am starting to laugh hard at this types of twisted propagandistic features; i used to get mad but lately this political "thrillers" are so washed up (plotwise) that anyone can see what is wrong with the American foreign policy...this features usually tend to have big budget so there are certain entertaining values, here as well, once one ignores the plot settings.however i can say that overall i enjoyed it from entertainment point of view at least and i did not walk out as i felt at one point...but first the good aspects; the acting is top notch; the pace of the movie is very fast but the action repeats itself, as the events develops , from different views of the people involved, however, each time something new is reviled, which in turn creates a quiet good suspense mode; the movie is very innovative at this chapter, no "letdown".Dennis Quaid plays his "usual",Forest Whitaker has a very "sensible" role that he fits in perfectly, Sigourney Weaver plays a very irritant and typical "media" boss but she does it well, Zoe Saldana is very sexy as always but the character is taken out of context unfortunately.the bad guys are quiet menacing.overall the plot makes sense( except a certain "brother" situation, too far-fetched and maybe a "luck" coincidence). towards the end the special effects are really good and the car chase scenes are just great, especially within the settings they used to do them. the feature contains unfortunately to many commercial of brand technical gadgets that especially the "bad guys" make constant use of ( that would be quiet false in the reality).just a few obvious observations now in DETAILS or certain frames . they are made from "stand alone" view point regardless of plot "twists" or conclusions.1- Zoe Saldana, the American reporter. she comments "live" that not everyone in the plaza is happy with American foreign policy she gets cut off and told to "shut up". right then i knew what will happen to her( typical Hollywood racist stand, remember 60;s and 70;s and how the one and only "black" character was dealt with by the screenwriter?). so you have a reporter that does her job, BUT the thought "she was stupid" is subliminally thrown into the viewers perceptions...2- this IS PRICELESS...American secret agents CHASING a Spanish POLICEMAN and SHOOTING at him on his OWN NATIVE STREETS(full of civilians) and with IMPUNITY! whomever scripted those scenes in is an ignorant writer at his "best", no matter how it tries to redeem the situation later (heh...so much about conquering hearts and minds, AT LEAST could have made the character a "terrorist"). maybe to the American public those chase scenes are nothing unusual , but to the rest of the world will have a strong meaning behind ...i was laughing here, more out of sadness actually...WOW, i actually wanted to walk out right there but i was not alone and could not just care for myself as the American agents do.i really wonder how ANY Spanish viewers are going to take this scenes "aS"...wild wild west comes to mind((3- while the president is actually pretty "cool" and "steady" here, his personal advisers are not; they represent exactly what is wrong in todays politics and also how "retaliation" never works.quiet scary that a Bruce McGill's character could actually exists (likely it does many times over). however the president here is quiet witty, so IF this was intended to re-invent Mr Bush imagine it fails miserably, however there are great sarcastic aspects if not. trying to give reasons for presidency mistakes and "values" would be laughable at best))4- the bad guys are quiet high-tech, seems that the technology has been invented FOR them!? as usual they must represent "fanatics" and there is NO attempt to balance things out by giving REALISTIC backgrounds to "why" or " what exactly for" things are done as they are(however i have to be fair and add that there is one exception to this as you will notice in the scenes with the little girl, not much to do with plot itself but still to take "note" of). the well overrated approach taken by Hollywood in creating villains, as everything in the world plays on some "revenge" scheme. what about economic/political/cultural aspects!? well as an end note , thanks for an entertaining road, i liked the visuals. but i am not buying it, especially the similarities between "then", "now" and "future" scenarios)))</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a movie that was running in Amsterdam since last 4 weeks. I had read the reviews about it, that it was something like Akira Kurusowa's Rashoman ? one incident, different view points and version. That interested me, but there were many reviews that said that the movie is not good. When nothing else to do; I went to see this movie, just for the sake of it. By the time I reached the theatre, the movie had already started. Settle down in the darkness, hesitating that I will step on someone's toes ? I selected a corner seat. After a while with eye adjusting in darkness and bright scenes coming, I realized that I was the only person in the theatre. This happened for the first time in my life. What was more amazing was that Pathe chain of theaters was screening the movie in an empty theatre. What if I had not purchased the ticket? Still then they would have screened the movie, just because the show was scheduled? Amazing! In India, even after buying the tickets we have been turned down by theatre owners and refunded the money, just because there are not enough people to see the movie. Anyways let us get down to the movie review.The story is about US President is on a visit to Spain. In a square where he is about to address the crowd, he is shot in his chest, followed by a bomb blast. What follow is eight different people's perspective of the same event, unfolding a little bit more of the suspense and mystery behind the plot of assisination of US President. Though there are eight different sub-plots there is a common link to all of them - the assassination. In the end, the plot is uncovered, the US President is safe and the villains are killed.Dennis Quaid as the personal security guard and Forest Whitaker as a bystander with a camera bring more life to the screen, just by their recognition. Till the fifth viewpoint, the movie remains interesting, but after that, it starts getting a bit to the nerves. Even though each viewpoint gives a new twist to the tale, it was a bit boring.This is the first movie by the Director Pete Travis, and he has done a commendable job, to say the least. He could have curtailed the number of vantage points. This view points would have been accepted if the climax of the movie was enthralling. In the present form, it was silly and B-grade, especially the hero and President, remaining unscatched in the midst of so much carnage and fighting.The cinematography was fast, with hand held camera, but was not as jarring as Borne Ultimatum. It was bearable. Some shots in the city were shot well ? the car chase was a bit long.The movie is not even a feather of the Rashoman style, but a time-pass commercial venture.(Stars 5.25 out of 10)</fullReview>

I was really looking forward to this and the opening scene got me even more excited but after eight points of view where at least four didn't even need to be told (because they had no relevance whatsoever) I was over it. In fact the six stars just comes from the idea and the acting. Dennis Quaid was very good as the secret agent and William Hurt was also very good. Sigourney Weaver was good at doing absolutely nothing to the storyline whatsoever and Forest Whitaker was just wrong for the part. Matthew Fox was good as the double crossing agent and all the other minor characters were interesting but besides that the movie really fell flat on its face. The ending was one of the worst endings in cinematic history and some of the twists in the story were so pointless I couldn't care less what happened to the characters. Overall; 3.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>20 minute short disguised as a feature length film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was optimistic about this film having heard some positive feedback, but after sitting through it, I can say it was a big disappointment. There was so much potential for an intriguing political action thriller, but instead, we were shown the same things repeatedly with only a small percentage of new or additional information. I kept thinking of a Star Trek:TNG episode where the crew are stuck in a time loop and they keep reliving they same few hours until they figure out what's going on and take steps to correct the problem. After the 1st few times, it gets pretty annoying and the same can be said here. I figure that they would do the "rewind" thing a few times, perhaps for the first 15-20 minutes, and then get to the core of the story and proceed to solve the case. This was not to be and we were all trapped in a time loop of our own. All the repetitive nonsense aside, they story was full of inconsistencies and plot holes, not the least of which was how some of our lead characters managed to survive a major explosion from such a close distance that they would, at the very least, have suffered from some significant hear loss. But despite being at ground zero, they come away relatively unscathed. Hell, even Forest Whitaker's camcorder survives the blast without a hitch. Other things that come to mind are the relatively poor security for the "real" president at the hotel. There is no way that a single man (I don't care what kind of special forces unit he came from)could have taken out almost all of the secret service agents guarding the president. Even if there was some kind of urgent need downstairs at the lobby, whoever is assigned to guard the president will not and cannot leave is his post. Additionally, the entire floor the president was on would have been off limits to ordinary hotel staff and guests and all entry points would have been guarded. And then to top it all off, the whole things ends up (following a fairly long car chase) within walking (or running) distance of where it all went down. Not to sound cruel or anything, but the lead terrorist wouldn't have jeopardized his entire mission because some girl wandered into the street. I've seen people walk away from some pretty nasty crashes and found it awfully convenient that all key players in the ambulance crash, except for the president, were knocked unconscious or killed. Not to say that it was impossible, but the van only toppled over onto it's side. Oh, and one last thing, I got a kick out of Dennis Quaid's bottomless clip. Sounded like he fired of more than 15 shots. Ultimately, I gave it a 5.0 because the story was decent enough, just poorly executed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first sequence of "Vantage Point", right up until the moment everything blows up, it's probably the best opening scene you'll experience this year. In a masterful construction, director Pete Travis places his actors in their respective positions and production designer Brigitte Broch ("Moulin Rouge!") recreates Spain's most important square so the president (William Hurt) can stand up and, as reporters cover the event, pronounce a speech. But then he gets shot, and we get to see that from eight different perspectives; or at least that's what the movie says. For a while longer, the constructions, riveting and unnerving, still work and will likely have you biting your nails. There's an agent (Dennis Quaid) who has just started to work again, a man (Forest Whitaker) who's on vacation, a Spanish agent (Eduardo Noriega) and a couple of another 'latinos', like the excellent Venezuelan actor Edgar Ramírez.Of course that the less you know the better, because for the first half hour, the movie stubbornly manages to maintain the repetition of the perspectives, showing us something new each time and ending it in the same exact moment; the moment everything blows up. However, and I don't know why, something starts going wrong after the fourth or fifth explosion (maybe it was the third). "Vantage Point" betrays itself, and leaves the personal perspectives asides for one that seems to be more general; a universal perspective that writer Barry Levy decides to develop. At this moment, any trace left of originality goes away and the viewer's expectations stop existing. When this 'universal perspective' comes into play, the film betrays itself and shows that's not able to keep up with the only thing that made it interesting in the first place. Now "Vantage Point" is like any other conventional action movie, where everything is supposed to fit no matter the consequences. What are the consequences, you may ask? Well, the disappointment of the intelligent viewer, who starts to analyze things and it takes a second for him to know that the filmmakers don't care. Twists, direction changes, unexpected decisions, whatever you want to call it; they are now all over the place and we're supposed to, like in "Hide and seek", accept them just like that. We could, if we happen to be involved by the entertainment the movie provides. I won't tell you that you shouldn't watch "Vantage Point": it provides, even with underused actors (Sigourney Weaver, Hurt, Zoe Saldana, Bruce McGill) and actors that these days are always doing the same (Quaid and Matthew Fox, unable to find something respectable apart from the "Lost" series). But in the end, when we've had enough, Hollywood conquers the screen completely in an embarrassing resolution and the good performances (Whitaker and the Venezuelan Ramírez) are not enough to make "Vantage Point" a good movie. Hell, you could assume your own 'vantage point' and come up with something better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing is what it seems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that sounded promising. First, it has a starry cast including Dennis Quaid (a welcome return), Matthew Fox (an escape from "Lost"), Forest Whitaker (always engaging), William Hurt (looking presidential in a Gerald Ford way) and Sigourney Weaver (sadly underused). Then the plotting offered something a little different: the same assassination attempt shown through eight different vantages with the viewer gradually learning more before it is all knitted together in a frenetic concluding section involving a furious car chase.It certainly moves fast enough and provides some entertaining escapism, but nothing is what it seems, the plot twists are increasingly unlikely, and the whole fandango threatens to collapse under its own sense of fantasy. Set in Salamanca in Spain, in fact only the aerial shots are the real Plaza Mayor with most of the the production located in the Mexican cities of Cuernavaca and Puebla. Salamanca is a common word for "trick" in Filipino which probably borrows from the Spanish colonialists. Like I say: nothing is what it seems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever Idea which loses its way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point is unfortunately a film over reliant on two gimmicks: an ensemble cast and the much vaunted 'rashomon' multiple viewpoint storytelling. The cast were effective although ultimately underused (Sigourney Weaver and Matthew Fox in particular were victims of a lack of screen time) and failed to elevate the film beyond an average albeit moderately entertaining thriller/action flick. The 'rashomon' style of the film was engaging to begin with, creating tension and interest, however it would seem the film makers became bored with the concept of making an intelligent (and different) thriller halfway through and instead opted for a, frankly boring and overly long, car chase which seemed to borrow too heavily from the Bourne Trilogy, yet in every way failed to match its class.Dropping the 'rashomon' aspect by the end and attempting to wind everything up in a hurried, knuckle-headed all-action 'concluding perspective' entirely lets the film down; besides this perspective seems poorly made complete with multiple goofs, implausibilities and a cop-out ending; you just wish they'd kept their heads and carried on with the multiple perspectives (at least one character needs their own, their motives entirely unexplained in the ending 'perspective').That said, this film is an entertaining ride, though delivering far less than it promises and is enough to entertain one night at a cinema for the opening hour alone. A solid 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling action packed and a great production.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point is like a really good ride in a theme park that you don't want to end. The way the story is told through the eyes of the different characters is a refreshing production of an action thriller. I really enjoyed the way the film grabs your attention over and over again. Sure the ending is a bit far fetched but what movie isn't? Dennis Quaid is great and well supported by the other actors. The production and direction of this movie is what is really special though. The action sequences and car chases are great. The story whilst complicated is exciting and told magically through the different characters. So strap yourself in and enjoy Vantage Point it is one great movie ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A clumsy first half doesn't detract much from a very enjoyable final half.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American President is shot, while speaking in Spain, and we see the twenty minutes leading up to this over and over, from different vantage points. Basically the film 'rewinds' every so often and we start again with a new central character and follow them in the lead up to the shooting and for a few minutes afterwards. Dennis Quaid is a Secret Service Agent, not long back on the job from having been shot, Forest Whitaker is an apparently amiable American tourist, who never does anything without having his camcorder up and at the ready, Sigourney Weaver is a news director, barking orders at a crew of journalists and cameramen who are (they think) about to cover a Presidential speech, and so on.Vantage Point is a big loud action film. When it stops to flesh out the story in some way (which happens a lot at the start) it tends to be pretty weak but when things speed up again and there is shooting and car chases and such then it is much more enjoyable. The car chase at the end is great and there is great satisfaction from seeing the truth revealed (to us). Early scenes (particularly the Sigourney Weaver segment) are hampered by clumsy exposition and awful dialog. Gems such as an emotional "Get up, kiddo!" (to a recently injured/killed journalist) and a grim "It happened on our watch!" are wont to make the eyes roll somewhat. Some of the twists in the story are very predicable (I spotted two of the bad guys from the very start) and some of the twists are genuinely surprising (one is like something from a sci-fi movie but it works very well here).Quaid is a very good lead. Indeed, it's a pretty strong cast across the board. William Hurt and Whitaker are particularly good, while Weaver and Matthew Fox are sadly underused (so Lost fans won't get much of a Fox-fix from this movie, but he is very good when we see him). Lesser-known actors (like Edgar Ramirez and Sa?d Taghmaoui) acquit themselves very well, too.The gimmick used to tell the story is little more than a gimmick. You gain nothing much from this storytelling method (other than the sight of William Hurt getting shot over and over and over and over again). The revelations that come at the ending are only revelations because they reveal information that the movie wouldn't tell us earlier on. For example, at one stage Quaid sees something significant on a TV screen. He exclaims in surprise and runs from the room. For no reason (other than a choice designed to intrigue/frustrate us) the movie doesn't show us what he saw on the monitor. It deliberately keeps us in the dark. Until much later, when the the scene is shown again and we get to see what he saw. The film is full of stuff like that. For no reason. It's false mystery, false tension, and the story stands well enough without it.Basically, they could have dropped the gimmick and told this as a standard action movie and it would have earned a solid "B" from me. But the gimmick (and the cool chase at the end) earns it a "B+".http://yetanotherfilmreviewblog.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a movie! (contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason I didn't give this movie 5 out of 10 was because the ending was so cheesy it made me cry with laughter.I won't give an in-depth over view of the plot for that can easily be found on this site or in other comments. The movie itself is similar to an episode of 24. A thriller, that would have been a lot better if not for the cheesy moments and numerous floors in the story line.To give it credit it does try something different by telling the story from 8 different points of view. But the way it does this, by getting to an explosion, rewinding and then starting again, got repetitive by the 4th time. I was sat wondering will this repeat for the next 3 hours. Fortunately for the second half of the film it continues in a normal chronological narrative.The Ending! Contains Spoilers!What the director and/or writer was thinker I do not know. The ending is amazing and in the cinema I was in, the whole audience was in laughter - Ending as follows - A young girl who was separated from her mother during the commotion of the assignation attempt, is found by Forest Whitaker, who takes her to a police officer. As the terrorists are getting away in an Ambulance, with the kidnapped president in the back. Out of no where this young girl who apparently has ran away from the police officer, is suddenly walking in the middle of the road and by another coincidence her mum who is near by, sees her and starts running towards her. At the same time the terrorists drive down the road towards the little girl. The terrorist then swerves to avoid the little girl, toppling the ambulance over. Dennis Quaid (a secret service officer) who was involved in another chase just happens to be there and finds the president in the Ambulance, he even calls out to him even though there was no way he could have know him to be there. I half expected Rambo to jump out and say, 'live for nothing or die or something' and kill the remaining terrorist. I'm not making this ending up and is worth watching this film just for the unintentional comedy ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flimsy Characterization destroyed the Vantage Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point displayed potential in the concept and its inherent qualities to weave a mysterious plot, but it was the character rot that pulled down the vote. I felt that the film had a spectacular action flick appeal, that kept the viewer watching, and even the most pretentious minds wondering what was going to happen next. But I simply could not get over the abominable characterization. The characters lacked a certain human dynamic that gave them a robotic feel. It wasn't the consistent time warp that made me angry, but how "singled-celled" the characters were. I felt that Forest Witaker certainly underachieved, not necessarily poorly acted, but poorly written. Probably a combination of the two. Whitaker was a make it or break it part, and he didn't sell it. It almost seems unfair to be so critical, because I felt like it stood up well against other movies in its genre. It kept me guessing and some of the action scenes were very well done, its a movie that should be rented on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This seemed to get a lot of flack for not being political enough when it was based around the assassination of the President of the United States by terrorists. I can understand wanting it to be more relevant and intelligent. Doesn't the subject deserve that? Maybe. I don't think necessarily. It just uses the current zeitgeist to make an entertaining thriller, and if you can take that, you'll have some fun. The film shows the assassination attempt from the points of view of several characters, finally joining the events up near the end. The cast is uniformly good, and includes Forest Whitaker, Dennis Quaid, Matthew Fox, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver. The trailers and commercials give away an awful lot, so if you haven't seen them, the film might be even more entertaining. The story is kind of silly if you examine it too closely, but the pace is fast enough that you're not too likely to do that. I wish the editing weren't so frantic, especially during the car chase climax. It's exciting, but would have been better if done Bourne-style, not MTV-style. I'm hoping more action filmmakers start stealing from the Bourne movies in the future. Certainly not exemplary, but it's worth a rental or a matinée.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Rashomon" crossed with "Groundhog Day"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As its title suggests, "Vantage Point" is all about the unique perspective each of us brings to the events we witness. To explore this theme, the movie employs the old "Rashomon" technique of telling the same story from the viewpoint of a half dozen or so characters present at the scene. The incident in this case is the attempted assassination of the President of the United States at an anti-terrorism summit being held in Salamanca, Spain, an event at which two massive bombs are also detonated. In Barry Levy's screenplay, each angle of the story functions much like an individual piece in a giant jigsaw puzzle, the full picture of which comes fully clear only after each element has been successfully fitted and secured in its proper place."Vantage Point" features a large cast of well-known actors, including William Hurt as the President; Dennis Quaid and Michael Fox as secret service agents; Sigourney Weaver as a TV news producer; Forest Whitaker as an American tourist; Zoe Saldana as a news reporter; and Eduardo Noriega, Edgar Ramirez and Ayelet Zurer as Spanish terrorists (the Spaniards definitely get the short end of the stick in this movie).Despite the deliberately fragmented nature of the narrative, the main focus of the film falls on Quaid's character, an agent who less than a year earlier took a bullet for the President and who is now returning to his job an obviously shaken and high strung man.Directed by Pete Travis, "Vantage Point" is a high octane political thriller that gets the job done without ever distinguishing itself overmuch. By constantly returning to the same event (the movie sometimes feels like a somber remake of "Groundhog Day") and relating the story through so many eyewitnesses, the film sacrifices some of its character development for sheer narrative pyrotechnics. Still, the storytelling is occasionally ingenious and Travis keeps the action percolating along at a fast enough clip to keep us from noting the sometimes far-fetched and overwrought nature of much of what the movie is showing us (it also points up just how many nefarious things one can presumably do with an iphone these days). There's even a humdinger of a car chase through the beautiful streets of Salamanca that is sure to get the adrenalin pumping, even if the mind is left reeling by its overall implausibility."Vantage Point" may have you rolling your eyes from time to time in confusion and disbelief, especially towards the end of the movie, but it is at least guaranteed to keep you entertained for the ninety or so minutes it takes to tell its story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Repetition with variation, leading to over-saturation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw 'Vantage Point' six different ways--before I'd even seen it. That's because it's one of those movies so heavily promoted that for a while nearly every public screening begins with the trailer for it and the trailer reveals all. I saw it six times. What was different was my mood--more and more angry.I learned there was a big public plaza in Spain crowded for a ceremonial occasion, where the American President is introduced--and promptly shot by a sniper. Off the plaza are streets, and these are used for car chases and little girls with ice cream cones walking into traffic. William Hurt is the President who gets shot, only it's not really him--not the President, that is. It IS William Hurt every time, because he plays both the President and his double; but it's his double who gets shot, which is embarrassing because the authorities need to reassure the world that the President's alive, but that will mean giving away that he allowed a double to be set up to get shot.. Sigourney Weaver is some kind of important TV news editor. Forest Whitaker is an American tourist standing in the crowd near the podium with a little video camera who sees something when the shooting happens. Dennis Quaid is some kind of important cop who rushes around. There are other people--lots of other people--but I don't know who they are.The extraordinary, but maddening, thing is that I got all this from the trailer (once was enough; but I saw it six times, remember?)--and that watching the film itself added very little in the way of certain knowledge and still less of enjoyment. Oh, sure, it's true as David Denby wrote, this film is a kind of splendid machine--a lot of action shot from different angles and presented in six different ways with coordination of the narrative time-line with each version, more or less anyway. There are plenty of holes in the storytelling. What I got from successive viewings of the trailer was an increasing sense that these scenes were all noise and flash and that the plot wasn't going to be very clear, no matter how many times I watched either the trailer or the whole movie. That proved to be true.So now let us pass, reluctantly, to the movie itself. After the twelve minutes or so of violent events, the movie goes back over them six times. Obviously this is inspired by Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon, the 1950 film that made the great Japanese director famous in the West and that tells about a rape and murder from five points of view--six, actually, since one person comes back and reviews the events again, more truthfully: a woodcutter, priest, bandit, samurai's wife, and samurai (who's dead, speaking through a medium) --and then the woodcutter again, telling the "truth" this time. Each time we "see" the sequence of events, or variations of them, from the different person's angle.The first thing to say is that Kurosawa is an incomparable master, his Rashomon is one of his great works, and it is based on two stories by a notable writer, Ryunosuke Akutagawa; Pete Travis is a mediocre television director using the book of the hitherto unknown writer Barry Levy in an expensive but unsubtle and unconvincing thriller which has been called a 23-minute movie dragged out to 90 minutes. (Rashomon is only 88 minutes long and feels richer and more haunting every time you watch it.) But nowadays it's not even clear that "Rashomon" means much because the name has been simplified into a vague sense that things come out different if you see them from different points of view, which is called "the Rashomon effect." The essential weakness of Vantage Point is that in its six "versions" of the main events--the shooting of the president; the chaos that follows in the crowd; a bomb that goes off under a table, resulting in further chaos; the flight of the perpetrators and pursuit by American and other agents; the attempt of the real President to get away--aren't really shown consistently from each different point of view at all. The return to the beginning of the sequence, signaled by an on-screen time line, and a shot of the plaza and the podium--which soon began to elicited a groan from the audience as it returned with monotonous regularity--just meant that new information would come, but not with any very clear sense of different people seeing things differently, as we get from the stories of woodcutter, priest, bandit, samurai's wife, and samurai in Kurosawa's 'Rashomon.'The movie of Vantage Point, as opposed to the more condensed, quickly-done-with version that is the trailer, does have a few surprises--sort of. Of course one of the cops proves to be a mole--a fake. Even his girlfriend didn't seem to know. One of the key revelations is that Dennis Quaid, who's taken a shot for the President the year before and is understandably edgy, saves the day once again. Another is that Forest Whitaker, tall and top-heavy though he would appear, can sure cover a lot of ground in a hurry, at least in this movie, because when the little girl he's befriended runs off, separated from her mother, he runs after her. Or is he running after an assassin? I forget. Anyway he's preposterously quick on his feet.As Denby himself says, "The soul of this new machine is the machine itself," which is to say this movie has no human soul. Without a sense of clearly different viewpoint in the human sense of various sensibilities and worlds of feeling, the successive re-"tellings" of events have no point and only give the audience--hence its groans--a sense of having been served up a lot of sequences that have been sliced in a Cuisinart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very surprising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having finished my shopping early, deciding to go and see an action film was supposed to "perk me up", but unfortunately this film did not totally satisfy.The storyline itself was quite interesting, the president "being" shot, later turning out to be a double, then a bomb going off, police chase et cetera et cetera, but just as it seems to be getting to a good part, it rewinds to about 27 minutes to before it all started.How many times did they rewind??? 4 TIMES. I'm afraid to say that this was the biggest let down of the film, constant rewinding as soon as it got to the good part, and after the last rewind had finished and the film eventually carried on, it was the same old stereotypical car chase, with a "bent copper" plot line, and in the end the president was lifted to safety. One of the noticeable mishaps was the blatantly obvious lack of continuity during the car chase, after the car had been hit about 7 times it came out of an alleyway looking almost perfect?? Very disappointing.I cannot fault the actors' performance styles, and the special effects were actually very dynamic, but it was plagued with continuity errors and a 90% fail rate of "rewind style" film style. In short, if you've got absolutely nothing to do, bored to tears and you're close to a cinema then you could go and watch it, won't harm you, but don't get envious to go and see it, don't save up to go and see it, and don't drive too far to go to and see it, not overly worth the money.Not bad, not good either.</fullReview>

The action scenes were good and the suspense was very awesome. If you can handle seeing the same thing over and over again about five times you will like this movie. All in all go see it while its in theaters or just rent it. Not a buying type movie in my opinion. Another plus was how each persons Vantage Point was suddenly stopped right before something bad was about to happen. I especially liked the car chase scene towards the end of the movie. All in all this movie has good action and a storyline. The repeating is what brings it down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disadvantage Pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point centres around the assassination of the President of the United States who is visiting Salamanca in Spain where an important terrorist treaty is to be signed. As the title may suggest we see it from a number of different characters vantage points and find out how the assassination unfolds.Unfortunately it unfolds very predictably, within the first five to ten minutes of the film anybody who has seen this type of thriller before will know exactly who the bad guy is. Clumsy, lazily dropped lines give the character away right from the get-go. So anybody with half an ounce of intelligence is left with an utterly pointless plot.In addition to the predictability this is completely spineless film-making, you can almost smell the test screening audiences from some of the lines. The last line of the film in particular thinks it's making a profound point but it's only one we've heard and seen many times before.Come to think of it, there is little use in calling this movie vantage point as the lame duck of a script isn't clever enough to solve the story through vantage points so the last 20 minutes become the typical bog standard climax to a below average thriller.Writer Barry Levy seems to have wanted to write something a bit different but doesn't seem to have the skill or the conviction to really sell us on the idea. Loose ends, clunky exposition and inane plot strands which would only serve to annoy the viewer, but fortunately your way past caring.The acting is sound, Dennis Quaid is on autopilot as is Matthew Fox. I don't quite know what Forest Whitaker saw in his role, he is completely wasted on a character which has very very little significance.Lazy, half baked film-making, if I was you, i'd make sure my vantage point was spent watching something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of "Vantage Point" is very intelligent and makes for a very entertaining film. However, flaws within the writing make this a "not what it could have been film"The script is generally very clever and it keeps the audience trying to guess (which is always fun). The story takes place in Spain where the US President is about to announce a speech to the world summit before he is shot. From this point the film rewinds several times to view the attempted assassination, what happened in events leading up to the attempted assassination and events after the attempted assassination through the perspectives of several characters.Since the film rewinds several times there is little room for characterisation, the only attempts at this were brief and focused on Forest Whitaker and Dennis Quaid. Whitaker has split from his wife and is missing his children so has a soft spot for a young girl who bumps into him whilst Quaid plays a bodyguard who took a bullet for the President a year earlier. Due to this Quaid's character is unsettled (as this is his first assignment since) and paranoid but still remains devoted to protecting the President.The film is drenched with big names who barely get a look into the film such as Sigourney Weaver who appears for just over 10minutes and Whitaker ( to be a honest a pointless character) is given around 20-25minutes of screen time.As the story moves on (or back) we begin to see how the assassination attempt is planned and discover that Javier (Edgar Ramirez) a man with special operatives training is responsible for taking out the the US leader, just so that the terrorist behind the whole thing release his brother who they have taken captive. This has obviously been done to blackmail Javier into doing their bidding but there could have been ample opportunity to expand on this and perhaps create a history between the terrorists and Javier (or his brother).The perspectives eventually all submerge rather conveniently at the end where all the characters are within 100yards of each other but the film does have plus points. Dennis Quaid plays his role well (a more serious role than some of his previous roles) and the car chase is sublime with great use of the camera and editing, similar to that of the Bourne trilogy. Overall the film is an entertaining, thrilling action film with an intelligent story line that weakens towards the last quarter of the film. Vantage Point has a few errors that critics will come down on hard, but if you enjoy sitting down and watching a thrilling action film that unfolds itself then Vantage Point is definitely worth a look!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>interesting story but too contrived Essentially it's about another action movie with many gimmicks, as to to imply that there's something original and relevant. It entertains, going back and forth in time and showing more and more plot twists. But the thing is that the more information is given, the more improbable the story becomes, so the ending collapses and has too many coincidences and clichés. We must recognize Dennis Quaid's performance gives an emotive back-story rendering the film interesting and also substantial but everything is finally lacking logic and gets more and more complicated. Overall the conspiracy plot eventually reveals itself as something unlikely and ludicrous, punctuated with banal sentimentality. All the standpoints give the viewer the only opportunity to see shootings, car chases and several bombings but don't really show people in the film, that would have been very important to see. On the whole it's a badly matched puzzle, though decently acted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait until it comes out on DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah it was good but it could be better. The movie is full of action and with some good unexpected twists, it will keep you on the edge of your seat The story is good, it is about the different point of views of an assassination attempt to the president of the United States in Spain. It has a very nice cast, Dennis Quaid as an agent of the secret service, his role is convincing, Forest Whitaker as a tourist gives us a very good performance, William Hurt is with a decent acting job as the U.S president, Matthew Fox maybe not his best performance but also good and Sigourney Weaver with a brief appearance. The time rewinding back for each character was a little annoying. My conclusion is that this movie was good but if you ask me I'll wait to see it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent flick, but the gimmick never quite pays off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with doing movies like this, with simultaneous/intersecting story lines, is that no matter how you handle it, you're going to put off some viewers. If you handle it Pulp Fiction-style, inter-cutting and jumping around in the chronology, you run risk of confusing more casual moviegoers. If done like Vantage Point, where you repeatedly watch a 15-minute segment and then rewind and watch it again and again from different perspectives, it feels repetitive, and by end it can feel like you only watched a 45-minute movie. In my theater I heard several people getting annoyed with constant "rewinding" after about the third time.The problem here is that while it was a nice gimmick, the different perspectives didn't serve any real purpose in the end that a more linear version wouldn't have. You spend the whole film watching different people seeing different pieces of the puzzle, but those pieces are never put together by anyone to solve the crime. In the end, all the main players just seem to end up in the same spots through mere coincidence. Throw in some serious predictability and you have a decent flick with a good cast, but one that falls short of expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not that bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought vantage point was a really good movie. It certainly has one of the most original set-ups of the last years. The writers really pulled something of by turning an action that takes place over maybe 20 minutes and turning it into a 90 minute long blockbuster. In short the story is that the president of the United States is in Spain for a speech against terrorism. The moment he wants to start speaking he is shot and moments later there is an explosion on that same square where the president's speech would have been held. That same part is showed several times but every time from a different vantage point, e.g. one of the president's bodyguards, a tourist, a local cop etc. And the more vantage points you see the clearer the story gets. I understand why people say it isn't a good movie but just that set-up of telling the story bit by bit while you show what different people do during the terrorist attack, I think that just the way that is told makes the movie so much better. However, it is true that showing that same action over and over again get's a bit boring but the makers have put so many little details in all the different story's that you just can't stop watching. You really get carried away with the story and with what is going to happen next. One other thing that I think would help making the movie more popular is more budget, not that 40 million dollar isn't a lot but compared to other 'real' blockbusters that isn't much at all, for example The Hobbit is made with a budget that is eight times bigger. So again, great set-up but it could be a lot better, even though cost-effective it is a very good movie. If the producers could've worked with a bigger budget they could for example work with actors who have a bigger impact. I am not saying that guys like Dennis Quaid, Matthew Fox or Forest Whitaker aren't good actors but how much more attention and revenue would the movie have gotten if you replace those by e.g. Bruce Willis, Keanu Reeves and Samuel L. Jackson. I know that those are the biggest names in the business but that would have guaranteed this movie a lot more revenue and awards. The only thing I was bothered by is that they just invented a new president, because the president is this important in the movie I would've tried to remake the actual president just to make it all feel more real. Therefore a well deserved 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's very little to complain about. Aside for some obvious factual errors (see the goofs section), it's a fantastic movie. The plot is one of the best I've ever seen, and I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time. Every character was well-developed, even the minor characters. And the casting was perfect, though I would have liked to see more about Sigourney Weaver. There's also plenty of action and suspense, which I'm sure you're a big fan of.I did notice that at times the pacing was a bit inconsistent, mostly with the beginning shots from each perspective. That's hardly a big deal, but it nagged at my OCD side. Movies that play with their timelines (Memento and Paycheck come to mind) have always fascinated me, and I'm glad to add this to my list of excellent timeline flicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vantage Point is a good idea, tolerably well executed, in search of a decent ending.The US President is about to give a speech in a city square in Spain, prior to an anti-terrorist summit, when he is shot and, in the ensuing confusion, a bomb goes off. We see what happens over a 20 minute period through the eyes and camera of a TV news crew. Then we see it again through the eyes of one of the Secret Service agents. Then we see it again through the eyes of someone who says he works for the Mayor's security, but who may be a terrorist. Then we see it again.... you get the idea. And with each pass we see a bit more of the story which we didn't know before, which either illuminates something, or else makes it clear that our previous expectations were wrong.This is a good idea, mostly well executed. Where it goes wrong is in the climax, when all the different characters come together and the segment we have already seen multiple times plays out to the end. This climax has an interminable car chase in it and a number of elements which are, frankly, so improbable as to rob the whole movie of credibility.What a shame. It was all going so well, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Chinese Literature teacher let us watch this movie so we can understand the Rashomon effect: a plot device in a book we're studying called the Fox Volant of the Snowy Mountain by novelist Louis Cha AKA Jin Yong. This movie is simply brilliant. Within 10 minutes we're treated to a spectacular explosion scene. Although the 6 POVs can get tedious (like the rewinding part), it is always fun to watch the president getting shot over and over again and explosions all the time, to slake your thirst for action. The guy acting as Barnes was a really good actor. Especially the car scenes. The trusty electric blue Nissan is certainly invincible and indestructible: it gets banged around due to driving up and down stairs and squeezing through traffic, not to mention flying debris knocking into it and a manic 360 degree spins that simply does not leave poor Barnes giddy, it only broke down when a truck crashed it against the wall. And Barnes just got out unscathed and kept running. The man has been blown away by a bomb and spun and crashed, but he just keeps going. This movie is unfortunately quite hilarious in an unintended way. Firstly, the bad guys are not gonna stop the ambulance and risk their own lives just to save a little girl. If they're so evil as to kill their own accomplice, why would they care about a stranger? Also, the part when Barnes save the President makes me nervous, I wonder how he managed to not shoot the President by accident. Overall, this is a very interesting way to spend 90 min, you will hardly feel the time drag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vantage Point. My kind of movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A short 5 minutes into this movie and I was already hooked. I could not take my eyes off the screen.I loved how each scene was broken up into its very own mystery. Each scene gave us a chance to get to know each character. In the next scene we discover the answer to the mystery, though the characters aren't informed yet and then we are introduced to a new mystery, bigger and better than the previous. Because each segment focuses on a particular predicament and particular characters, we get the opportunity to know each of the characters in depth. This is when we grow our fond attachment or our strong distaste for them.Vantage Point really was the whole package. It was shocking, suspenseful, and carried the big mystery as well as the little mysteries well. It also toys with your emotions.Pay close attention to the details. Everything?every move, every character, every word has a meaning. Some are obvious while others are very subtle.I was disappointed that I didn't get to see this on the big screen with no interruptions. I think it would have made it a million times better.I highly recommend Vantage Point. See it ASAP. You won't be disappointed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realize how you could watch this movie having Rashomon in the back of your mind. Don't. It's a really well made action thriller. You'll see the same 23 minutes over and over again. Every time a few new facts are revealed. While I've seen loads of this type of action action movies, and most of them are very enjoyable to watch, this one definitely stands out. It's not too long, very well paced, well acted. And they didn't bother to weave in a love story that makes no sense and only distracts from the action like in many of the movies of this kind. If you like to wind down, get rid of the stress of the day and have about 80 minutes to spare, you won't regret watching this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So why the low rating from IMDb users? Sure I am a liberal rater but I can't really rate this lower. It is not a flawless movie by any means but I was entertained throughout. It is a movie which may not make people think for a long time. It is not a movie which has good character development or a slow moving thriller where the tension builds into a crescendo. The movie has nonstop action right from the beginning.The basic concept of the movie is inspired from the Japanese classic Rashomon. Iga;t is a movie which is shown from the viewpoint of several people who are connected by one incident - the shooting of the President of the United states. The movie keeps shifting from each viewpoint to another each time revealing one detail which can make it clearer what is going on there. The twists and turns are quick so it might be better to pay attention to everything that is going on in the movie. The main characters are a bodyguard named Thomas Barnes(Dennis Quaid), Forest Whitaker as a tourist, Eduardo Noriega as Enrique and too many to list. Which means that the plot is centrestage in this movie instead of stars. The positives : The fast moving pace of the movie. This is one movie which is likely to be lapped up by people with short attention spans. The twists at various stages in the movie will be liked by people who like mysteries(like me). The twists are not illogical so that in itself raises it in my eyes. Some of the dialogue has some antiwar tones. Sure it may be somewhat cheesy but it is nice to hear antiwar views in an American movie. The movie is densely plotted which means each and everything that happens has a meaning. The dialogues are short and to the point. There are no overly clever dialogues(ala Tarantino) but some of the dialogues are good. One of my favourite lines is this - "The beauty of American arrogance is that they cannot imagine a world where they're not a step ahead". The performances are again not revolutionary and quite adequate. Edgar Ramirez and Ayelet Zurer give good performances but they don't get much of a chance to display their acting chops. Dennis Quaid is pretty good as the bodyguard who has doubts about his ability to protect and he tries his best to catch the culprits. The negatives : Shaky cam style. Which means that the movie has some moments where the cameras keeps shaking and the events during those scenes(especially car chases) are not very clear. still it may not be a big problem as in other movies, due to the fewer scenes in which this style is present. Another problem is the jerky style that happens whenever each viewpoint ends. This may look a bit too cheesy. They tried to be as over the top as possible(not that it bothers me that much) and this might not be to everyone's tastes. The replay value is another factor. A movie like this may not be of much value after the first viewing. I think I can only judge that only after a few viewings. Still the complexity of the twists was pretty good and inventive so it wasn't just a regular Hollywood thriller and they have tried to make the audience guess till the end.Despite the flaws, I give the movie a 7/10. This is because of the twists and I was hugely entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most captivating movies I've seen this year. The nature of the film requires it be seen at either the big screen or blu-ray disk. I saw it on the latter and from start to finish I was caught in a fascination of a well choreographed, fast-paced, wonderful thriller. I thought the acting by all to include the well-know (Dennis Quaid, John Hurt, Sigourney Weaver) and not-so-well-known was superb. There are very few films that I start and stay without getting up and taking a break but this was one of them.I noticed that most comments compare this movie to the Bourne series. I don't think that does it justice. It's better than the Bourne movies and I don't have to worry about a sequel.This is a keeper and one that can be watched over and over to see the intense detail from every perspective.Enjoy!</fullReview>

The casting was good, and William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver played important roles in key parts of the film. They showed they are the upper class-men of modern cinema. There are generic moments that serve as filler. But it did make me think of the sophistication of modern terrorism. In that aspect it was educational. But I found the process of the story to be realistic and believable. When the film was over with I felt like I had been through an experience and got my ticket's worth.

Now, don't get me wrong - there were some totally incredulous moments like Dennis Quaid as a secret service agent being on this particular PPD only six months after he already took a bullet for the president, and Forrest Whitaker as a camera toting tourist actually being able to get off the crosswalk fast enough to save the little girl from getting run over by the ambulance, but, hey, don't come see it for an education - come see it to be entertained for a couple of hours.

		<shortDescription>One of the most intelligent action movies of 2008</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Vantage Point" is a intelligent and yet a great thriller movie whose focus is to show different points of view over the same happening: the shot of the American President during a special event on Spain.Here, the American President Henry Ashton (William Hurt) is attending a global meeting against terrorism when he's shot during his speech. And after that two bombs explode leaving the crowd in a complete state of shock and desperation. The attack is repeated over and over again by the perspective of several characters and what do they saw it before and after the attack. We seen the point of view of: a Secret Service Special Agent (Dennis Quaid); an American tourist (Forest Whitaker) filming the whole event; another Special Agent (Matthew Fox); a TV director (Sigourney Weaver); several Spanish people; and the President perspective. Al these characters want to know what happened, who is the shooter and who detonated the bombs and they start a long running against the time searching the perpetrators of the attack."Vantage Point" executes with lots of tension and action a very interesting mystery but sometimes it looks like a story that we might have seen in another movie. But it still great. Director Pete Travis made a wonderful movie about the notions of perceptions, the many different vantage points over one single dramatic happening. It's something that might be over repetitive for some people to see over and over the same moment of Dennis Quaid throwing the guy on the floor, and then the bombs explode and it all happens again and again. But that's what this movie is about. History has many sides as also stories as many sides. For those who watched "Z" and "JFK" knows exactly what I'm talking about. A happening that is watched by several different persons and what really did they saw it. The attack is shown like graded layers that add dynamism to the story. In "Z" what really happened with the congressman in the square? In Oliver Stone's "JFK" the same thing, who killed Kennedy and why? Who testified? It's the same story but instead of a more political approach we seen a highly entertaining thriller with a great mystery too.I believe that "Vantage Point" can bring more people to watch more serious movies about the similar subject because it really make people think, brings curiosity and it's fun to watch. It's like an exercise, the more you do the more you like, and the more you train the more you become an expert on the subject. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plenty of bang for your buck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The core idea of showing you one sequence of events repeatedly from different viewpoints, all of which must be seen to decipher exactly what went down, is a very interesting one, and suggests there's going to be all sorts of twists, turns and jaw-dropping reveals on the go. In that respect "Vantage Point" is fairly disappointing, as the plot isn't nearly as complicated as the idea suggests and none of the revelations are particularly mind blowing.That disappointment aside, what you do get is a decent, tight action thriller which gives you a fair bit of bang for your buck (especially considering you get to see the explosions several times, nice), even if it does feel a bit like an episode of 24 which has been elongated by forcing you to watch each little box out individually. The cast is great, with Matthew Fox making the transition to the big screen convincingly, although Forest Whitaker's turn is strangely duff.Despite the great concept being slightly wasted, there's just enough intrigue and excitement to make this well worth a watch, particularly for members of the Jack Bauer Fanclub.</fullReview>

However, they made a mistake and thought Spain was Mexico (or wanted to make it look like it was for some reason my mind fails to understand). The crowds in the movie are not from Spain (Europe) and they all look Mexican. So do the Spanish cops. There's only one Spaniard in the whole movie, that is the Spanish cop (Eduardo Noriega,) that the US secret services want to arrest. Not only that, but the crowd shouting against the USA does so with a Mexican accent.This movie is a joke in every sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What you find when you rewind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Vantage Point" is a much more conventional thriller than the trailer leads you to believe. There is zero reflection of issues such as subjectivity or unreliability of perception. It doesn't even, as the title seems to suggest, show us the same story from the point of view of different individuals, as seen in Mike Figgis' highly innovative "Timecode". The camera merely picks out different aspects of the same ten-minute segment. Incoherently, one of the characters remembers critical moments from his own past in a black and white version of archived TV footage, rather than from a first-person perspective. The movie starts slow, but picks up some speed as the attention shifts to the president (William Hurt). It turns out the sideshow *was* the summit after all. Most parts are strangely over-acted: Sigourney Weaver's hyper TV producer, Dennis Quaid's traumatized secret service agent, Matthew Fox' ostensible traitor, Forrest Whitaker's compassionate tourist. By comparison, Ayelet Zurer doesn't do much to bring her pretty terrorist to life, yet manages to make Veronica a much more believable persona in the end. Just like Mexico City poses as Salamanca, "Vantage Point" is an average "Alias" episode posing as an exceptional thriller. Although made more or less by big-screen, big-budget newcomers, the movie has the look and feel of Hollywood staple without much of the zeal or daring you might expect from a debut. Fans of "In the Line of Fire" or "The Sentinel" will have no complaints though.</fullReview>

I will say that a majority of the acting was well done and that they did a great job selecting the cast.

		<shortDescription>It Was Alright...Entertaining, But Not Great. Hey, At Least They Got The Gun Right!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>KIND OF SPOILERSEh, wasn't bad, but wasn't great either.There was a LOT of cheese in it, and that didn't make me feel convinced about anything. The biggest problem was that it felt REALLY disconnected. I liked their attempt to show all different viewpoints, but it got really repetitive after awhile.The best part of the movie was the last half hour. Things really picked up, and the storyline got interesting. As of EVERY Secret Service-type movie, there IS a mole! VERY impossible too, since the mole joined the Secret Service in an attempt to be in on the assassination attempt. I wont get into too much detail, but the mole would never have made it in, or been able to do that type of protection that quickly after graduating.The other BEST part of the movie is that they finally got the darn gun right! ALL the agents were using their Sig Sauer P229 pistols. Unfortunately, they were using 9MM bullets (Which IS A Blooper) as I saw when Dennis Quaid's character loaded his gun. No, the Secret Service uses their P229s in a .357 Sig round. But yes, it was refreshing to see the correct gun, after having seen movies like The Sentinel.Another bit of badness was that at one point in the movie, Secret Service agents are getting knocked off like the Rangers in Black Hawk Down. WHY, does this happen in EVERY movie with Secret Service agents??? And of course, the agents act a bit strange. Like a scene after Dennis Quaid wrecks his car, and a Spanish man starts yelling at him in Spanish. Dennis Quaid whips out his P229, and says "Back off" while he brandishes it. Yeah...you can figure that one out.The thing that saved it in my opinion, was the ending. I wont tell you it, but it's pretty good, and tries to make you think. I know I got a little off topic, but I'm really critical about guns in movies.All in all, I give the movie a 7/10, and a decently entertaining popcorn flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Vantage Point: Expect Less, Get More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hamlet's "the readiness is all" needs to tweaked in case of movies: if you get something you were not quite ready for, you may have quite a good time.It's either audacious or just plain dumb of Sony Pictures to trumpet the story of "Vantage Point" in advertising and promotion around the world, around the clock. What's the point of seeing a movie about "the attempted assassination of the President from different perspectives," veritable spoilers well illustrated in trailers? Expectations may well lead some critics to blast the movie, but if you take the "giveaway" as a challenge - can they still make it interesting? - you may well come out of this slightly convoluted, definitely flawed suspense/action flick with a measure of satisfaction. Sure, there are some perplexing coincidences and baffling situations, but why expect perfect logic and efficiency? This is just a movie, not U.S. foreign policy or any other paragon of such virtues.In the event, it's relentless, heart- and hard-pounding, perfectly acceptable entertainment for those who prefer not to breathe for almost all of its 90-minute length. And, thank you, thank you for not foisting another bloated 2-hour movie on us! Yes, William Hurt's President does get shot at summit held in Spain (Mexico serves as a fine - presumably less expensive - substitute), and Dennis Quaid's grim Secret Service guy chases unmerrily after the culprits; yes, there are different vantage (and videotape) angles to all this, but - advertising notwithstanding - it's not a "Rashomon" wannabe, Akira Kurosawa's name taken in vain.If debuting writer Barry L. Levy has a model, it's more Thornton Wilder's "The Bridge of San Louis Rey," unpeeling mysterious layers of the reason people coming together in the same place, at the same time, to be part of a dramatic event. If you think watching the same thing happen again and again, while you must look for different aspects, the "real reason," etc., relax: Levy does rewind the film repeatedly, but he manages to add both different perspectives and additional bits of information, constantly taking the story further along. You can just sit back and enjoy.Making his feature film debut, TV director Pete Travis does a smooth big-screen version of "24" - in fact, restraining the loud bang-bang genre to something acceptable.While writing and direction, Hurt and Quaid are OK, Forest Whitaker is excellent playing... Forest Whitaker, and there are some good hitherto unknown actors, I had a hard time with Sigourney Weaver's haggard TV news director, and Matthew Fox's behavior as Secret Service chief - but then there is really no need for any more spoilers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a mess of a movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember thinking about half way through this train wreck "wonder if I can sneak into another theater and watch something else?". What an incredible concept for a movie - but what a horrible application of said concept. One horrific event, from 8 different perspectives. Yes 8 perspectives. You get to watch one perspective... then rewind... then the second perspective... then rewind... then the third... well... you get the idea. The hype on this movie suggested clues would be evident within each perspective, allowing you to put the pieces together as it goes through each agonizing rewind event. Ha. Hardly.Spoiler follows, but I don't think it really matters that much!OK, see, what happens is... these terrorists... they want to kill the U.S. President at a summit in Spain... or so we think. But wait! Actually they want to kidnap the President. So apparently the terrorists coerced this special forces GOD by threatening to kill his brother...and said special forces GOD manages to take down the entire Presidential Secret Service contingent (whom, as a whole, are a bumbling batch of idiots with a traitor in their midst), pretty much by himself (with some help from a suicide... er... homicide bomber), waltzes into the President's hotel room, and kidnaps him. Oh, it really is the President as the real President just watched his "double" get blown to bits while impersonating him at this summit. And then...Aw hell never mind. It doesn't really matter...Presidential doubles? Special forces guy coerced by terrorists? Terrorists can figure out the whole Presidential double thing while the rest of the world is clueless? Turncoat Secret Service agent who commits high treason? Are you kidding me? Oh. My. God. And I never knew terrorists had cool James Bond type gadgets! Or that the head-terrorist is willing to kill dozens if not hundreds of innocent people at the summit, but baulks at running over a little girl in the street - dooming his cause to failure in the process.This movie is a wreck. It is one implausible situation after another. Wait for it to come to cable... or rent it... but good lord don't buy this crap! You'll only encourage them...Who the heck are all these mental giants giving this movie a 7 star average? Guess they needed something to watch while they wait for the next Ernest movie to come out... Newsflash: Jim Varney is dead! And so is this movie.</fullReview>

Best way to compare this is somewhere between Run Lola Run, The Bourne Series, one of the many US Presidential Motorcade Thrillers (In the Line of Fire, Patriot Games etc) as well as a hint of Oceans 11 and other coup type movies. IF you are politically correct or judging the movie from non-movie criteria, please go ahead and give it one for the communists, but those of us that like this movie, likes it a lot.Also check demographics, age groups and voting pattern, and you may see a number of artificial 1 graders. This is clearly a 8 movie, but I gave it a 10 in order to compensate all these political protest votes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, but over acted and things are still not explained to well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the first trailer for Vantage Point, I have to say that it really did not catch my attention, it looked like one of those typical thrillers that tries to confuse people so much into thinking that "well, I don't get it, it's so intelligent, I have to like it" type of movies. But I decided to just go ahead and give it a chance this afternoon and I have to say that it is definitely better than I expected, in fact, over all I think I did enjoy it. But there are still some major flaws to this film, like the acting. We have some fantastic actors, some who have won Oscars, been nominated for Oscars, or are known for doing some great movies. So, Dennis Quaid, very over the top and in some ways unbelievable, like a stunt that was pulled that I'll explain later. Most of the actors looked like they had just read the script the day before and just looked lost. The plot was typical and needed a little more.The president of the United States is due to make a very important speech in Spain, the speech to end all international terrorism. But all that has changed when he is shot and killed in front of everyone. But not everything is all it seems. From several points of view: the president, the body guard, an American visitor with a camera, the terrorist, and a black mailed man, we learn the juicy details in this mixed up and crazy thriller.Now basically, this film does have quite a bit of technology, which in some ways frightened me, the past year we've seen films where technology has taken over, especially video camera's, can be helpful, can be a little much. It's just weird to know this is the type of society we live in where everything is filmed and there is no such thing as privacy or mystery. Back on what also I was going to say about the stunts, Dennis Quaid gets into a HORRIBLE car accident, goes walking away without a single scratch, just a small limp. There were a few plot holes not to mention, it was hard to keep up with who was a bad guy who was a good guy and they never got back to certain characters. Over all, this isn't the worst film, but it's not the best film of the year, so it's up to you to see it, it's a strange one to recommend.5/10</fullReview>

The bad guys stopped the truck just because they didn't want to hit the little girl?? That's a little bit hard to believe. Whatever, it's an excellent excellent movie. You got to watch it!

		<fullReview>Labyrinthine thriller set in Spain where the President of the United States prepares to make a highly anticipated speech regarding his stance on global terrorism. He's gunned down however, apparently the victim of a complex political assassination, and in contrived movie fashion we get several differing viewpoints of the shooting that tie several unrelated characters together. Has the makings of a taut, suspenseful thriller early on, but the continuous use of flashbacks gets old quickly, and the script throws out one improbability after another topping it off with obligatory car chases, shootouts, and fatal escapes. Film doesn't seem to have much of a point, except maybe how to overuse a familiar gimmick. Was the casting of Sigourney Weaver as an anal-retentive television producer really necessary? **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big bunch of nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not the worst movie I've ever seen, Vantage Point definitely ranks among the lowest. My wife and I thought we'd learn different things about the shooting when shown the various vantage points. Instead, we saw the same things from a different spot in the plaza. The only new details were when we followed a character beyond the second bomb blast. Thus, the movie's name is, misleading, to say the least.After we go through the basic shooting scene over and over and over (yawn) we finally move on, only to focus on all sorts of unbelievable, unrealistic action with much of it never explained to the viewers. Events that happened early in the film were never concluded, never re-visited, just dropped.Then we had a car chase scene less realistic than what the Keystone Cops used to have in the 1920s. All of it filmed with the camera spinning and panning, making we viewers dizzy or nauseated. The chase scene went on far longer than was useful to the plot, with cars skidding sideways through almost every intersection, and amazingly avoiding pedestrians, including the one time when a vehicle went a block or more down a crowded sidewalk.I had a huge problem with the scene where the two kidnappers riding in front of the ambulance gleefully killed their partner in the back, guarding their hostage. They killed him before his job was over. As we saw, the unguarded hostage was able to free his arms and attack his kidnappers. That's why they had the guard beside him in the first place. There was no reason not to kill the "loose end" later.The outrageously unbelievable device used at the end that ended the chase scene was the topping on the cake. The guy who will happily kill thousands will risk his own life and ruin his entire kidnapping plan just to avoid hitting a little girl in the road. Sure.I gave it a 3 instead of a 1 or a 2 because the early part held my interest as I wanted things to be tied together, and because it wasn't greatly offensive. To me, anything under a 7 out of 10 isn't worth watching. We wasted $8 on this rubbish, I'm sorry to admit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good, but not that bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just start off with the fact that I had high hopes for this movie. I had been waiting to see it for months. It just seemed that intriguing to me.First, the good. The plot was as excellent as advertised. Perhaps, there were some implausible occurrences, but not enough to warrant my wrath. The acting was good and much of the directing/producing wasn't that bad. For the better part of the movie, I thought I knew what was going to happen next, only to be surprised by what's his face's betrayal.The bad. I don't think there was that much wrong. However, what they did get wrong was extremely costly. Perhaps, they were trying something new, but you're never going to want to rewind 5 times for any film. That's just ridiculous. Short attention span or not, literally watching the same couple scenes 5 times is just foolish. After they finished the movie, who said, "this is a great idea?" How could any movie producer allow this to happen? With such a hit/miss idea, you think you'd at least find some people who would oppose such an obnoxious part of the film.I think if not for the extremely annoying rewinds, the movie would have demanded a much higher rating than my current one. How many movies have a double for the President? How many movies challenge the audience to think, "are we really that vulnerable?" In the end, I would recommend all to wait for it on DVD. Maybe worth the rental, but certainly not the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my God, i think i'm in love again. With a movie i mean, lol. I absolutely adored this film. Fast and furious from start to finish. The plot centres around the assassination of the US president, and shows the view from all the characters involved, including a secret service agent, play brilliantly by Dennis Quaid (This guy looks amazing with a gun and smart suit... Could be the next Jack Bauer), and a TV news station crew. The rest of the cast are in great form, including Forest Whitaker, Lost's Matthew Fox, and an underused Sigourney Weaver. Now i know what you're thinking... It's another one of those films that shows you the exact same thing from different people's views over and over... And you're right. But i've never seen one handle it as well as this. It's really exciting to see the events rewind and switch to another character. And the direction is a masterpiece. The tension is unbearable, and the action is incredible. It has one of the best finales any movie has ever had. The car chase is spectacular. I could talk about this film all day, but i'll stop now, and go drool at the prospect of owning it on DVD when it's released.

		<fullReview>The brilliance of Vantage Point is underscored by the fact that its director, Pete Travis, had never directed a feature film before, just TV movies and miniseries. That lack of experience is completely invisible in this surprisingly taut and creative work of sheer genius.In Vantage Point, the President of the United States is assassinated moments after taking the podium to give a speech on antiterrorism in Spain. The event is then replayed numerous times through the eyes of various characters, and each replay gives the audience additional insight as to what has actually happened. It's not just a matter of determining the chain of events, it's a matter of figuring out who is involved in the shooting, and to what extent.Dennis Quaid plays Thomas Barnes, a Secret Service agent who's being eased back into the rotation; the previous year, he had foiled an earlier attempt on President Ashton's life by jumping in front of a bullet. Now he's on the job in Spain, keeping a watchful - yet nervous - eye out for potential problems. Matthew Fox plays his comrade, Agent Taylor, who's been the buffer for Barnes with the other men on the team. Forest Whitaker is an American tourist in the crowd during the speech, taping the proceedings with his Handicam, and Sigourney Weaver is a tough-as-nails news-program reporter who watches the events unfold before her on TV screens, helpless to do anything.At times, watching this movie feels like a particularly violent punch to the stomach, because so much of the movie - but not all of it - is shot in cinema verite' style, and you honestly feel like you're watching raw footage. And this filming style yields a movie that's just packed with searing emotion, taking you from shuddering lows to absolute euphoria. Whether you're looking at the events through Howard's camera or on the monitors in the GNN newstruck, you simply cannot turn away from the devastation. It's a testament to cinematographer Amir Mokri that the fast-paced action and unmitigated violence lend such an aura of reality to the proceedings that you feel as if you're watching the whole thing live on CNN at that very moment.As I said, the events are replayed through the perspectives of various characters, including Barnes and President Ashton (William Hurt), and each time we learn a little bit more. What events occurred before the Big Speech? Did anyone know there was a potential threat against the president's life? We need to piece things together ourselves, as if we are investigating the crime detachedly. It's worth noting that in the earliest scenes, the atmosphere within the courtyard in which Ashton is to make his speech is markedly different from that outside the complex, where people are basically hanging him in effigy.The entire cast is outstanding, but particular notice should be given to Quaid, as this may be his best work since Traffic, perhaps ever. Quaid has always been a poor man's (or younger) version of Harrison Ford, but even in his heyday he was never Mister Action Guy. Here he's a vulnerable human being, a shell of a man trying to recover both physically and mentally from the previous attempt on the president's life. Thomas Barnes is no superhero, and because Quaid is so good you never feel certain, not even nearing the end of the movie, that he's going to save the day and make everything all right. He might, and he might not. The bad guys might actually win.It's no surprise, too, that the perennially awesome Whitaker is outstanding here. His Howard Lewis is in Spain basically to get away from his wife, from whom he's estranged, in an effort to recharge and figure out how he wants to proceed - and, of course, to witness an historic speech. It's not implausible that an American tourist would be in the audience, and if there's one thing we Americans like it's our gadgets. Lewis is the common-man counterpart to Barnes and Ashton, a Johnny-on-the-spot at a critical, horrifying moment.Had this movie been released later in the year (or even late last year), it would likely have been a major Oscar contender. From my vantage point, it seems the studio got this one wrong. Vantage Point is extremely well done, evocative, exhausting, and ultimately rewarding exercise in realistic film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Clock was ticking way too loud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I gave this movie a 6, it could have easily been an 8, a 9, or even a 10, if they had tweaked it ever so much more.Overall, the movie was intense, from the very beginning we are shattered with the effects of 9/11. The shooting of our President, and the terrorists bombings, being played out on live television. The repeated return to the noon hour to explore another Vantage Point, was good, but the underlying stories were too complex, or unbelievable to make it totally work for me. Entertaining yes, but not enough to keep me excited beyond the drive home, which is sad, because Quaid was again terrific, and the overall cinematography was excellent as well. It just had too many complexities to cause it to become "real." I just wish they had made it a factually "real" assassination plot. Then used the same style camera angles and story telling to take us to the conclusion. I just couldn't believe all of the sub-plots. The complex requirements that every little detail was planned out precisely by these people was a negative. Anyway, I still thoroughly enjoyed the ride, but just like a roller-coaster, once you get off, the thrill is quickly gone. The three days of the condor, or All the President's Men were thrillers that stayed with you for days. Oh, and I loved the liberal slant that the Hollywoodites had to put in it. Yeah, the terrorists kill the President, supposedly, and if we respond decisively and quickly, then we are doing what they want. To not respond in kind, is a sign of strength. Straight out of the Barack Obama's and Michael Moore's diary.Oh well, enjoy the fun while it lasts, but know it will fade away a few hours later.</fullReview>

This was disappointing to me because it made me disconnect from what was going on and focus on how out of place things were. They didn't even bother changing the 'Alto' stop signs to say 'Stop' like they do in Spain.If it had actually been in Spain I would have given it a 9-10 because the story and how it evolves is pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-made and intelligent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailers we have been watching for the last several months set up "Vantage Point" as a hot and thrilling action/drama type movie. And while there was quite a bit of action, the element of "thrill" may have been significantly decreased by the style in which the movie was made. Vantage Point may not bring enough sheer excitement to the table to keep fans of hard action movies sated, but I personally thought that there was a great balance between the action, drama, and suspense. The central plot point of Vantage Point is essentially a "Whodunnit" mystery. As far as the audience is concerned (from the trailer AND from the first ten minutes) the President of the United States has been shot. For the next 90 minutes, the movie weaves an intricate and interesting explanation for the assassination. This is done by showing the same ten or fifteen minutes from five different perspectives. I'm sure that this part throws many people, and the fast-paced action element is decreased by seeing practically the same scene five different times. It even becomes a little frustrating, seeing the characters futilely attempt to solve the crime, all to the same disastrous end. However, each time the scene is shown, there is always something different... something of particular interest to the character that the movie is currently following. By slowly revealing the who/why/how, the audience is just as baffled and the characters. However, once the mystery is more or less "solved" and the loose ends are tied up, we see how many of our initial impressions, (impressions that we often shared with the characters) were very wrong. In all, I would say that this is a very well-made and fun movie that was "smart," and made a lot of sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't listen to all the haters... Vantage Point is a very good thriller. This film is for people who are tired of Hollywood-style sequels and are looking for something new. Yes, it does contain moments with unintentional scoffing (later laughter) and yes, it does bear resemblance to Rashomon, but that's not it. It's main point is to entertain and it delivers.The story's main perspective shifts from one character to another, while filling out plot puzzles and bringing in new twists until it all comes full circle at the end, satisfyingly. The direction is fast, sharp and crisp. The editing is rightly paced, although the music needed a little more work though. However, hats off to the performances as the actors were more than convincing and will make you get drawn to the point. Also, the action sequences were handles nicely (although some did get repetitive and annoying at times, you'll see what I mean) and you'll just ignore any problems and proceed to watch the resolution.Overall, a great thriller that somehow could have been better, however I'm not complaining. It is a breakaway from sequels, cliché-ridden movies and cheap DTV action movies. This movie is worth a watch or two.6.3/10 overall.8.4/10 for entertainment.Delton</fullReview>

The ending is also very cheesy and everyone in the room was laughing (it was not supposed to be funny). Although the plot was interesting (somewhat true to today's political problems, but only at the start), the movie was not very good.

		<fullReview>After seeing the trailer a few times I thought this movie had a chance of being good; but after not seeing any reviews until just before the movie was to open in theaters I knew it was going to be bad. Vantage point's gimmick had the possibility of producing a good thriller but a directorial gimmick does not a good story make. This movie could have taken a lesson from HBO's Sleeper Cell or any movie that bothers to understand that you have to have the audience invested in the characters. Speaking of the characters, you couldn't tell anything about the actors because there wasn't enough dialog to make a difference. The so called villains (mostly unknown actors) were much more interesting in their dilemmas than the good guys but you really had no idea why the mastermind was doing what he was doing; why just because he's a terrorist? Human beings are most complicated than that, especially someone with that much electronic knowledge. Poor Ms. Weaver and Mr. Whitaker were wasted and I'm sorry Forrest you were just terrible but it wasn't your fault that your character was written to be a stupid American running around. I agree with some of the other critics I have read who said that the media angle could have been used much more effectively. Instead of Whitakers characters being a bystander he should have been a journalist that would have made more sense. Lastly, the so called surprise ending I guessed after the second rerun of the events, not so thrilling. After the third retelling of the events, my poor husband threatened to leave the theater if they replayed it one more time. Too bad; writers are the problem with Hollywood today maybe they all should go back on strike and Hollywood could hire all new ones. 4/10</fullReview>

Director Pete Travis (Not to be confused with the movie critic for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers) does a nice job showing us different peoples point of view on a chilling situation. He captures how the President isn't the only one affected by his death. We uncover the lives of news reporters, the terrorists and killers, secret service agents, other politicians, and a tourist who all see the world in different ways acting around them. We never know what to believe until the end, making an entertaining movie throughout. We do spend too much time experiencing the character's lives rather than just solving the mystery. This plot not only feels like a theatrical "Law &amp; Order" episode, it would have played better as a quick TV episode. If "Vantage Point" didn't have the corniest dialogue, the wimpiest acting, the stupidest sound and visuals, then maybe this could get a passing grade. We spend too much type viewing the failed attempts at bringing a fun and familiar plot to take us away for a couple hours to mix with a human drama we're supposed to care about. This movie crumbles under ambition and lunacy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent action romp, lots of twist and turns but seriously lacks depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Vantage point' is a clever action/slight psychological movie which revolves around the shocking assassination of the U.S President. It is re-told from the perspectives of 8 different people, each gives us a new clue/fact or piece of the puzzle and as the movie progresses, they fit together and we find out the criminals behind it. Some have said this movie has too many clichés but I strongly disagree ; this is an excellent concept but I will admit that it does falter at points in the execution.It boasts a reasonably high-profile cast with big names such as : Dennis Quaid , Matthew Fox , Sigourney Weaver and Forest Whittaker. However, I feel that all 4 of these in fact, had under-written parts in the movie simply because it has 8 flashbacks to get through, all in the space of one and a half hours. Therefore, no individual in the cast gets a huge amount of screen time , limiting the depth that they can go into with each character. There are a lot of 'twists and turns' in the movie, a lot of them unpredictable, people not who they seem e.t.c , but as their characters are portrayed rather shallowly it never really comes across as a 'shock'.'Vantage Point' is entertaining, unexpected and never boring. For the short amount of time that the actors get on screen they do a good job. However, short running length and lack of sophistication in the characters prevents us from experiencing the 'thrill ride' that the trailer seemed to imply. A good Saturday evening film but could have been executed better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Vantage Point" is a fast-moving action film. After it gets done showing the same basic action a number of times from the vantage point of various key players, it becomes a long chase film. At that point, the time goes by quickly as its 90-minute running time passes. But as it shows the starting action scenes, which involve an assassination and a bombing, it tends to try one's patience at times, not overly so, but some. I was glad when these recurring scenes introduced fresh perspectives, however. That alleviated what could have been a problem as the story skirted repetition.Through these vantage points and this method of backing up time to show the various characters, the whole film overcomes what otherwise would be a very difficult problem, which is to introduce a slew of different people whose lives intersect. Older films that deal with such matters as assassinations often run 2 hours or more due to these complications, like "Day of the Jackal" and "Nine Hours to Rama". So, I consider this storytelling method as clever and effective, also novel.We have some very clever terrorists in this movie who outguess the Secret Service in forecasting its methods and moves. They can't outguess the human element however, in the person of Dennis Quaid as a Secret Service agent who is so determined.There is some good interplay between the President (William Hurt) and his advisors who are urging quick and violent responses.This is an action film that is reasonably intelligent and can be watched again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Vantage Point" is a 2008 film with a great cast: William Hurt, Forest Whitaker, Dennis Quaid, and Sigourney Weaver. The director, Pete Travis, has okay credits.The story takes place in Salamanca, Spain, where the US President Henry Ashton (Hurt) is attending a summit; a treaty concerning the fight against global terrorism is going to be signed.Now, before this event, Ashton appears at a public event in the Plaza Mayor. At 12:20 p.m., he's shot. Several minutes later, a bomb goes off in the Plaza. There is complete chaos.We are first shown the event in a broadcast room where the director (Sigourney Weaver) is calling out camera angles and talking with the on-site TV journalist. The horrific events occur. The film then deals with the twenty minutes before the event as seen by eight people.First of all, I want to address the appearance if Sigourney Weaver in this film. A waste of a wonderful talent. She did a great job with what little she had to do, but the producer could have saved some money by hiring a chimpanzee.Okay, now that's out of the way. This is hardly a new concept, but let me say that eight looks at those twenty minutes is at least four too many, given that it's a lot of car chases. None of the actors get to do too much: Forest Whitaker is a spectator who runs around with a camera; a very mature-looking Dennis Quaid is a Secret Service agent who is just getting back on the job; Hurt has a line here and there.I found this only mildly interesting with a couple of decent scenes. If they'd cut four versions of the event out, there would have been more room for some character development and more intrigue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast and furious action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a fast-paced drama maintained throughout and the music (so appropriate) adds to the exciting atmosphere. It's about a world breaking event?the visit of the American President to the city of Salamanca in Spain to organize a plan involving all nations of the world to put an end to terrorism. A bold plan indeed.The thousands that gather in the square to welcome the President almost invite danger and sure enough there is an assassination attempt and a bomb blast that sends the cheering gathering into a panic-stricken mob.Among the crowd is an American visitor with a digital camera who is constantly recording the events taking place. His recordings become an important part of the investigation which follows. Secret service agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid) acquires the camera for clues to assist in his investigation.There are numerous flashbacks which when added together use up valuable time in the presentation of the plot. When one analyzes the film content it is quite a short film covering mainly the events in the square and a subsequent car chase to capture the terrorists. There won't be any Academy Awards for acting ability as there was none Most of the actors had to run a long way requiring athleticism rather than acting ability. The director accented the fast action all the time swamping any opportunities for some great acting.The introduction of a little girl called Anna into the script seemed strange to me. It was almost like a sub-plot suggesting that there were still some good people among the rabble. The black American tourist offers to buy her another ice cream when he bumps her in the crowd. He feels warmly towards the little girl as he has a child of her age back home. Eventually he is responsible for saving her life from a speeding car.The writer of the screen play was not sure how to bring the story to a satisfactory close so he chose a sentimental ending. The little girl was handed over to her distressed mother and the American made an urgent phone call back to the USA assuring his family he was coming home. It was a rather sudden ending after all the turmoil, but an ending that was written for American audiences.I have watched the DVD twice and still find the characters somewhat confusing. The flashbacks should perhaps have helped me in deciding who were the terrorists and who were the police and who were the moles, but the repeated flashbacks did not help much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>maybe I'm missing something here but i don't understand the need to show the movie from 8 (I had actually lost count) viewpoints when the most important and crucial one regarding the terrorists one as they initiated the shootings/bomb is by far the mots important one. In my view, the WHOLE movie should have been about this plot and time would have been much better served in such a comparatively shot movie on why the terrorists were doing this, the organization they stood for, how they were able to achieve what they did etc. Its still a watchable movie and some credit should go to the producers for some attempt at originality and the choreography in some of the action sequences was creditable but a word to the director, next time you want to show a film from 8 angles, stop at 3!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good set up, then it goes down hill in the third act.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has an interesting premise, it goes back in time over again and again to show the vantage point of several people during a terrorist attack. Hence the title "Vantage Point", The movie repeats the same 14 or 15 minutes and show what several people were doing just as a terrorist attack a meeting involving the President of the United States. We're shown the views of Secret Service Agents, tourists, reporters, the terrorists and even the President himself. It's like "Rashomon" where we see the same few minutes again and again but from the perspective of different people. But then as the movie continues it would turn into a chase film as the terrorists' plot is uncovered and revealed. The movie has an International cast, although the majority is American, they all played their parts well. Although frankly I didn't think a single one of them really stood out. The closest would be Forrest Whitaker. Of course with his imposing presence it's easy for him to stand out. He plays a tourist who finds himself taking care of a lost little girl in the middle of all this chaos. Dennis Quaid who was in the middle of the action and supposedly the hero just didn't stood out. He certainly gave a good performance but not one outstanding enough to carry the movie. I suppose in many ways that's the problem with Mr. Quaid, and that's why he never became a film superstar. He just doesn't have the screen presence to carry a movie. The film is well crafted, the fast paced action sequences moved incredibly well. It's incredible to see an auto chase taking place in the narrow streets of Spain while there are still people (probably stunt men) on the them. These action sequences were the equal of the ones in "Ronin". The camera movements as they follow people through their vantage points is crisp and very well made. All the way to the terrorist attack we see how well crafted it is. But then we see the real terrorist plot and it's one of those plot twist that's so convoluted that it stretches credibility to the snapping point. Even how the terrorists' carry out the plan is non credible.Filmmakers nowadays are so keen on outsmarting the audience that they take their twists to a level that's unbelievable and unbelievably bad. I call it the "Flightplan" plot twist, I know that producers started doing it a long before "Flightplan" but that's when I decided to give it a name. Basically it's a plot twist that's so convoluted and so lacking in credibility or realism that it destroys the rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Vantage Point" is certainly good entertainment, but sadly on a TV-series level; it feels like a longer episode of 24.The premise is good, the filming is creative, and the suspense created is very strong. Sadly it is not fast enough to mask that the logic fails all too often, making me feel that I'm being made a fool of - which to me kills any enjoyment of a movie.No amount of action and (excellent) car chases can mask a script which relies on a pistol-toting gunman single-handedly defeating half of the Secret Service. Maybe in The Matrix, but this was not supposed to be sci-fi, I think.So, good fun for Sunday afternoon, which sadly leaves a bitter taste...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste-- of talent, money, and time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"One of the best films in years" someone wrote at this site. Gimme a break. Okay, first of all, I WANTED to see this. I like conspiracy films, I like action films about US Presidents, and I liked the cast. In fact, I LOVED the idea of the premise: Over time, we get to see the mystery of a Presidential assassination unfold through the de-layering of the 'Vantage Points' of the stars. One problem-- the movie DOESN'T deliver on this premise. It does for a while, then suddenly deteriorates into one long, Jack Bauer-like chase and terrorist shoot-em-up. *Yawn* The direction is quick-cut ADD, typical of lousy Hollywood films today, with the director allowing these same movie stars to chew the scenery. I've never seen a worse performance by Forrest Whitaker. Dennis Quaid is no Kiefer. Sigourney Weaver is completely wasted (why did she agree to this?). The convoluted, not properly set-up typical terrorist kidnapping and shooting is dull, while it tries to be manic. I think you get my drift on this. Great idea ruined with a lazy second half and poor direction. And now my spoiler, that I MUST include, because it generated such an unintentional laugh-- At the very end of the film, with dozens of people killed, the President kidnapped by a group of terrorists, videotape and eyewitnesses galore, the movie wraps up with a serious overtone. A TV announcer somberly notes that what happened was the work of a Lone Gunman. Ha ha ha. I get it. A la JFK, folks, get it? Ha ha, um, ha. Pathetic attempt at a dramatic last line. Please. Writers, check out the first half of the film, figure out how you could have been more clever in giving us a solid payoff, and THAT is a movie I'll go see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best action thriller, but adequate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the movie was sufficient enough to keep my attention, I'm glad I didn't shell out the bucks to see it at the theater. But it was adequate enough to justify renting it.With that being said, the title and previews pretty much let you know that you are going to see a movie that is going to replay the same events from different "vantage points" - hence the title. So, I think for reviewers to grate on and on about hating that part of the movie maybe should have stayed away when they heard the name of the movie and saw the trailers.The repeated rewinding of events didn't bother me as much, but my husband began sighing several times after it did for the 4th &amp; 5 th times. I viewed it more as pealing away the layers of an onion to solve a puzzle.But the plot itself probably could've been a little deeper developed and in the end seemed rather simplistic once you see the whole train of events. It is rather an unlikely sequence in a lot of aspects - but I guess that is where suspense of disbelief comes in. My biggest complaint is how the ending wraps up a little too neatly and seems to literally drop in Dennis Quaid's lap.I think Quaid's acting was quite good, but then this isn't so far of a stretch of the usual type characters he plays. I'm not sure I bought Matthew Fox's portrayal - without giving too much away, he is definitely playing against type and I'm not sure is that believable. Forest Whitaker is quite endearing as the Accidental Tourist type and bumbles into key scene after key scene. I do find it hard to believe that he is able to capture all the key sequences with his little camera and amateur skill. Where were all the GNN cameramen and why were't they chasing the action as effectively - that is what they are paid for and are supposed to be good at.I do think the movie takes a jab at the current administration. This can be seen in the crowd scene with signs that have "W" with a line through it (even though the President's name in the movie is Aston). Also, there is some corny dialogue when the President is taken back to his room for safe keeping. One of his staffers says "Sir, we have to act strong!" (in retaliation to a terrorist attack) to which the President replies "NO, we have to BE strong!". I would have rather they saved the political commentary and just presented the story and let the audience make there own conclusions and judgements. Also, the rating said for "brief, strong language" but there was language through out the entire movie, so Im not sure what was brief about it. I think there were too many unnecessary instances of taking the Lord's name in vain as well. Why don't filmmakers realize this isn't necessary to tell a story.Overall, this is a unique way of unfolding a mystery and kept me interested enough. Just be forewarned about the repeated rewindings and if this is not your thing, move on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As every review will tell you the film is about the leading up and period immediately after an assassination of the American president whilst he is ironically giving a speech and Anti-Terrorism Spain of all unlikely places. This period of twenty minutes is seen from a few pints of view and therefore you might like I did almost fall asleep a few times. Dennis Quaid plays a secret service agent who finally figures out whats going on after twenty minutes which is far too long for these sort of investigations. Forest Whitaker play a tourist who manages to save a little girl from being crushed by an Ambulance which is sliding on its side after an accident.I can safely say that this film totally sucks and the trailer was successful in sucking me in.I suggest you wait until its a DVD weekly.

Not because of his acting ability (I believe him to be one of the best) but because Idi Amin committed such horrors. Vantage Point makes you remember what a great guy Forrest Whitaker can be. Such a great acting ability to be able to play both roles and do it convincingly.Great action role for Dennis Quaid! I thought he filled out his character perfectly! I have always liked Dennis Quaid but thought he was a "same old, same old" actor. This performance was by far his best ever. I hope he keeps it up and lands some more roles like this one.Sigourney Weaver was great too I wish she was more in the story. Her small part as a down-to-business news gal was a good role for her.Ayelet Zurer I had never heard of until I watched this movie and thought her character was very convincing. I found out she's one of the most acclaimed actresses in Israel. VP could be her big leap to the USA. She has a beautiful voice and a charismatic presence on film.We all see things from a different point of view. This movie takes it apart looks at the incident from everyone's perspective without telling you the end. Every twenty minutes they leave you hanging until the final scene pulling it all together with an ending that makes you want to cry or cheer! I love this movie.

		<fullReview>An assassination attempt is made on the US President who is holding an anti-terrorism summit in Spain. Secret Service Agents Thomas Barnes and Kent Taylor look for some clues on Howard Lewis's handy cam as there is a blast at the podium, leading to further pandemonium. The film loops over and over from different participants' perspectives and the plot convolutes as the storyline rewinds and restarts at the same point in time eight times over; the secret service agent and terrorists anticipating each other's moves and outdoing each other. Ultimately when the mystery unfolds you feel good about all pieces falling into place.The best part is the car chase scene in the end, amidst the already chaotic city, that kept me on the edge of my seat. Fast and jittery camera work during the entire length of the chase keep adrenaline pumping in as you watch the Chevrolet Astra chasing the Police car. It is absolutely amazing and cool! The locales are spectacular, in the ancient Spanish city of Salamanca, although the golden sandstone buildings occupy only a few frames in the beginning of few perspectives.Dennis Quaid has done complete justice to his job. He portrays the strong and convincing look of a person handling such an important position, and his sharp, aquiline eyes are on the vigil every instant. Forest Whitaker also played his part of the innocent, courteous, helpful tourist well, who had to go through so much. Israeli Ayelet Zurer looks good as the mastermind's sidekick.The flip sides are an ending that could have been better, and a few goofs and some improbable uses of technology, and you'll have to keep guessing the terrorists' real motivations.Overall, a fast-paced action thriller that keeps you engaged from beginning till the end, rapid-fire editing and cinematography topped up with a few good actors and an interesting narrative make Vantage Point a must watch.</fullReview>

In Memento, this kind of messing around with time produced a very interesting film. If this movie had been shot and edited well, the audience would have been on the edge of their seats as each pass revealed new pieces of the story for them to try to reassemble into a whole narrative.Instead, we have a mess. Continuity is ignored, at least two of the vantage points are redundant as far as the story is concerned, and many elements of the plot are just laughable.Perhaps some of the acting was good.

		<shortDescription>Poorly crafted episode of '24'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actionmovies and improbabilities - there's a controversial relationship. Now I don't mind people jumping through fiery rings while dodging bullets from 3 machine guns and somehow managing to land without getting a scratch on their macho stubble bearded faces, replacing intelligent writing with adrenaline rush entertainment can be a fair trade. Sadly, I can't say 'Vantage Point' entertained me very much, and it's chock full of highly implausible events. For one, I'd assume the secret service'd employ more than just a handful of men to guard the president, especially when the threat alert level has been raised high. And why doesn't anyone seem to wear flack jackets?? Brushing aside the ridiculously dull (and formulaic) storyline, the director just bored me with his action sequences. I kept waiting for this sub-par episode of '24' to improve, but I waited in vain.It doesn't help of course that the incredibly annoying Dennis Quaid got way too much screen time in this debacle, he possesses two facial modes: angry and not angry (but usually it's angry). I love Matthew Fox on 'Lost' but unfortunately we see way too little of his character for the actor to really make an impression. Pete Travis wastes most of the good names on the cast list (Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt), Forest Whitaker is the only A-grade actor that is given a decent amount of screen time, but he never appears to find his character, instead he gives us a mixture of some of his earlier characters (the gentle hearted man in The Crying Game, the calculated reasonable man in Phone Booth).For me, the hardest films to review are the ones that excel and those who plummet deep into failure, I mention this to explain why this review may sound dull and uninspired, it is born out of the mediocrity of the film. Do yourself a favor dear reader, far craftier action movies and TV-series await you, pass up on this one.</fullReview>

Good idea, but would have worked much better had there been some deep development both in the storyline and in a few of the "vantage point" characters. This is disappointing. It's the kind of film that you would get tired of no matter how "fast paced" it is. Indeed, there's virtually zero scenes that slow it down, but nor is there anything of great substance that gives it real depth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The president of the USA is in Spain to hold a big speech on the next step in the war against terror. A big meeting is being held and big steps are to be taken in a heroic effort to solve everyone's problems at the same time. Quite sadly, before the good things can happen the president is shot.As the starting point for a thriller this is OK enough. What follows is a fairly standard "whodunnit" that wouldn't stand out of the crowd at all if it hadn't been for the fact that part of it is shown as seen through various eyes. Each time the film rewinds to just before the events it plays another angle and shows another piece of the puzzle and it takes a few rewinds to complete it. After that it winds down towards its end like any other multiple angle film.This whole idea is quite nice, and it would have worked wonderfully if it hadn't been for the fact that out of the first four rewinds only two parts displayed any actual new pieces of the puzzle. The other two just rewound and showed the same bit of film again, just differently shot.This has the effect that the first half of the film is downright irritating, giving off the very sour feeling of having been ripped off after having paid full price for it. The second half of the film makes up a bit for this, but not enough to make it worthwhile.3 out of 10 irritations maximized</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was about to rate it 6, not 7, but let's face it, I like Dennis Quaid. The movie is an action thriller trying to present the same thing fro multiple points of view. However, unlike shows that have done this successfully, like Groundhog Day (which was fun) or Regenesis (which rewinds the tape only a few seconds or a minute to present another "vantage point"), this film does it in a very boring and annoying way. If I had to hear that Spanish politician saying his bullshit line one more time (I mean he says it 5 or 6 times!) I would have smashed the TV!Anyway, after presenting the same thing over and over from different stand points, one expects some insight to come of it, but no: the thing just gets going from the view point of Dennis Quaid, through high speed car chases and shooting, the ever annoying child (the only terrorist in the film, I think) jumps in front of cars prompting people to react and the movie ends.Bottom line: the film is well made as special effects and stunts, but that's about it. The story makes no sense, the bad guy(s) are immediately obvious and the whole chain of events, while presented thoroughly, feels disconnected. And what was the idea with Sigourney Weaver's cameo? (that's the only way I can describe it)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie I felt a little bit confused, but definitely satisfied by the movie. The acting could have been better, and the flashbacks could have been a little more diverse, but over all I felt that it was a good movie to watch with your friends on a Friday or Saturday night. I saw this movie about 3 weeks ago, and since then I've forgotten most of the plot and scenes. It's not one of those movies that will stay in your head for a long time. As I said, its just a movie that you might see with your friends on the weekends. Overall, Vantage Point was good while I watched it, but wasn't worthy of my memory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While there are many posts going back and forth on the merits of this film and the technique of playing the same scene over and over again, I must say that this is where the film is strongest. Seeing the same scene from different vantage points fleshes out perceptions and details very well, although by the last re-showing I just prayed the movie would advance.Once the movie left the "Plaza Major" scenes, it fell apart. The number of coincidences was phenomenal, the plot holes were large enough to drive charter buses through. Most of which are fairly well documented in other postings here.Summary: - The movie is strongest when setting up the story through the use of vantage points. - The movie is weakest when trying to advance the story past that point.Opinion: Watch it once when you've nothing better to do. Once will be more than enough!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally movies like this one contains huge plot twists. A great example is the French movie "He loves Me, He loves me not". Well there are some twist but they don't really surprise you. The whole movie feels unfinished. You never really get to know the motives and the background stories of the characters so you don't care about all the events in the film.There are also many unnecessary "perspective scenes" which causes the movie to get very repetitive and boring.I guess the reason for that is that the movie is filmed in just 10 weeks and it was rushed into production.overall: The film can be entertaining for a while but gets boring really quickly.Not quite as I expected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We see the story from the vantage point of several different characters.1. The TV Camera Crew 2. The Shaky Hand Secret Service Hero 3. The Accidental Tourist 4. The Stupid Policeman 5. Potus - The President of the US 6. The Assassin - otherwise known as the Gullible Terminator 7. The Terrorist GroupWe get to see the motorcade drive by 7 times from different angles We get to see the President get shot 7 times And worse, we get to hear the welcome day speech 7 annoying times. etc.. What does watching all of this mean? A very boring film.Mind you, I have watched films which have used this "different perspective" view with great effect- notably Groundhog Day, Rashomon by Akira Kurosawa, and Run Lola Run.But this film sucks big time. I wish I could lock up the entire editing team, together with the Producers, Director, script writing team, and other thinking members of the film in a small unairconditioned room with hammers and force them to watch the film 7 times over. They might learn a thing or two.FFS, there was so much fluff in this film you could knit sweaters for the whole of China.Its filled to the brime with annoying clichés and cliff hangers- notably the stupid child who walks into the middle of the highway looking for a mum - at the same convenient time as the Terrorist van comes hurtling down towards her. The same terrorists who have murdered about 100 people brake to avoid hitting her and crash their car in time for the hero and the rest of the ensemble cast to show up at the same time.This film needs some serious editing before it becomes watchable.The only interesting part was the twist involving the President and his view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a mix of exciting action and incredible, but I mean totally inconceivable and preposterous sequences. I kept waiting and waiting for the real story to lock in for when the highly touted vantage points to be pulled together and used to solve the mystery. If you want to see a great movie that has plots using terrorists, go watch again the film Ronin....Please! I won't spoil this for anyone because the only enjoyment is the multitude of plot twists. But I will say, do not go the bathroom or you might miss something...like the ending. The 90 minute run time is even stretching it and must take every frame of the credits.None of the roles seemed to challenge any of the actors, at least not the stars like Quaid, Whitaker and Hurt. Each of them have given us great performances. This time they really have nothing to work with.Comparing this movie to Ronin is like comparing a pulp fiction paperback to Les Miserables. You can enjoy both but one has substance that lasts and Vantage Point does not. It is a shame because the concept could have developed into an intriguing and suspenseful mystery.I can't give it more than 3/10. It gets it's 3 for being mercifully short because it would have been unbearable at 20 minutes longer.</fullReview>

And moving back and forth in time made this movie repetitive and annoying. Just thinking back on this movie, I think it a waste of my time, and definitely not worth yours.First of all you, it seems like your going to get to know this camera crew then it jumps to a secret service agent, some backwards terrorist cop, then a black man who really gives me the sense that he's a pedophile, and just all over again. What makes it worse is that none of these scenes are constructed together so that they are unified in the end.

		<fullReview>I watched this movie yesterday and i must admit i was expecting it to be much much better! I liked Fox a lot since i m used to him playing his Jack role in Lost but other than that...The flashbacks got a bit tiring after the 3rd-4th time even though afterwards they showed some interesting things. Most importantly though, the movie was a big propaganda, a fact that i hated. Americans must realize that not all terrorists are Muslims or Arabs or whatever and although i m not Spanish, why imply that such a hit can take place in a European country and not in the US for example? Finally and equally importantly, the movie was FULL of goofs. I was watching it for the first time and could spot so many things. First of all, the Astras in Spain are Opel and not Chevrolet! Jesus, couldn't they do some research?! Also, they made huge mistakes with the damage of the cars. Once the headlight is broken, then it s not. Same with the bumpers, same with many things! Also, in 1-2 crashes, with such speed, the airbags would come out but they didn't. Another thing, the alloys of the police Astra are different in the beginning and in the end. Is it so hard to at least put the same alloys on the car?! In general and mostly based on that, the movie was very poorly made. It s 2008 and not even 80s movies make such mistakes! I m very disappointed because they could make it much much better but i guess they ran out of money...Oh and another thing. I really doubt that in real life, they d have the president in a hotel less than 1 km away from the speech point!So, again, the positive point is Matthew Fox and only that i m afraid.Prefer it on DVD!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vantage Point *** Director: Pete Travis Starring: Matthew Fox, Forest Whitaker, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Dennis Quaid Certificate 12A Run Time: 90 mins Best bit: The beginning and the car chase Worst bit: Seeing the shooting again and againI wanted to like this film. I thought this was a great idea, having 8 different view points eventually solving the puzzle, sounds neat, but it was not.The reason it wasn't, is because seeing the explosion 8 times was just annoying, the rest of the audience seemed to agree, by there groans as it stop and reverses to 12:00 am once again. To be honest reversing to 12:00 am makes sense, its just doing it 8 times and 3 of them being pointless to the main story line that makes its annoying. The first three - quarters of the film are either pointless, the same thing over and over again or building up to the ending. As for the last quarter of the film, it's an adrenaline filled, car crashing bucket of awesomeness.The basic plot is President Ashton (William Hurt) is attending a global war on terror summit in Spain. Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Matthew Fox) are two of the Secret Service agents assigned to protect him. As you probably know the President gets shot. All this is being filmed by Howard Lewis (Forest Whitaker), who Thomas believes has got a picture of the shooter. So Thomas and Kent split up to find the shooter.As for the acting which of there is a lot, it's not bad. Dennis Quaid does well. Matthew Fox that you don't actually see that much also does well. Forest Whitaker basically runs for nearly all the film, and does quite well. All the actors and actresses do well. There are no really bad performances.You may be thinking, well that sounds quite cool. Well the fact is that the film is mostly seeing the shooting again and again with small differences to it, like I've already said, so that shortens the whole story. What happens after the shootings is mostly quite cool, apart from Forest Whitakers story as it seems pointless. Two of them literally seem to be the same things.The good points are that the idea was cool, it's well made, the acting is good and the car chase is awesome (not as good as the Bourne ones). The bad points are again the reversing is annoying, it's badly written rubbish, the President ends up a somewhat hero and once more the reversing is annoying.My verdict well made rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the advantage of having multiple points???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title itself proclaims loudly what the film sets out to be; several differing angles staring at one hell of an event. The actual event lasts probably less than twenty minutes, and the crucial characters count less than ten. After being bombarded with several drama series of "24" and "Lost", and films like "SAW" series, this method of narrative presentation is less than original. Shouldn't have made a loud announcement about it. Because of the way the story is told, the event itself lacks in background information, which makes the story less convincing. One can easily see that there are eight angles (the tagline spells it out), but there aren't that many "perspectives". In order for "vantage points" to work as a story-telling, it needs massive background homework to be presented together, hence this works with TV dramas with weekly revisiting. But attempting such method on a one-off film lasting less than two hours is a reckless driving. However, the film survives, I think, very much due to the superb depiction of the car-chase action. And Mr. Whitaker, can he run or can he not!! After enjoying "The Last King of Scotland", I thought I paid due respect to him, but he proved me wrong. I must admit I am officially his fan as of this film. I will be fair, and give 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent film for the average movie goer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let's get one thing straight - Vantage point wasn't a bad film, and I can see it being "good" to some people, but I certainly can't see it being a classic by any means.The premise of the film was good, granted it's not the first of its kind, but I can't help but feel that the film is more a tribute to the triller genre, made by an action film addict.The concept of multi-perspective storytelling is to craft completely unique viewpoints of the same story, each telling us something that other viewpoints couldn't.Vantage Point completely fails to grasp this idea, and we literally have to sit through the same story over and over again, with each latter viewpoint (except for the second to last viewpoint) giving us merely a larger picture. None of the earlier perspectives matters to the story at all, and the most they offer is a tiny bit of insight into the already flat and predictable personalities of the cast.The final "viewpoint" wasn't even a viewpoint anymore, the film makers seem to have given up and just throws everything in the air and treats us to another Die Hard movie (minus the humour and wit, and comparatively toned down action scenes).The production value of the film is probably its only saving grace. Vantage Point is, by no means, a terrible film to watch. It tries to experiment with the novelty of non-linear storytelling and multi-perspective narration, it fails to deliver the brains, but nevertheless offers some good (but not superb) visuals. It's worth a watch on a lazy night in.But if you really want to see some quality multi-pers storytelling, you're better off catching the episode of Malcolm in the Middle that also toyed with the same idea and achieved some genuinely good moments. That is of course if you didn't think to pick up Rushomon which Vantage Point shamelessly try to compare itself to.</fullReview>

All of the actors do a great job portraying their characters and everything in the end all fits together. Twists in the plot through out the movie happen that you never could have never predicted or saw coming.And yes it does get a little annoying with the movie physically stopping and then rewinding back to the exact same time that day five times but that is kind of the plot of the whole movie. 8 strangers and 8 different vantage points kind of means that you have to go back and see how each of those people witnessed it and what they experienced.All and all its a great movie with suspense, drama, and most importantly ACTION!

Virtually no coherent character development was present, the entire thing felt like one big meaningless action scene. Numerous blunders were made, but those can be overlooked, provided there is reason to overlook them. The part that got to me the most was the complete lack of a reason for the "bad guys" actions. There was a theory, but it was hardly confirmed and NOTHING came from their point of view.If you like watching some giant incoherent action packed thriller with no reason to be in suspense, this movie will keep you entertained.

That being said, I want to say that I think the idea of portraying an event such as the assassination of the president from several different perspectives is an appealing idea. Wish it had been done better. Insofar as the acting is concerned, There certainly will be no academy award nominations. It was satisfactory, but not outstanding.

The execution just relied on it way too much.The best way to explain it is imagine you're doing a stage production and of course there's something going on everywhere. You give 8 strangers (3 audience members, 2 professional camera men, someone back stage, and 2 cameras to the people calling the shots) cameras and have them record everything they see. The scenes where only one person see what's going on is cool, and scenes where you get different views is even better, but it quickly gets old when you realize that all 8 people are watching the same cute little girl eating chocolate for what seems like the first time.That's basically how the movie was, and then the ending comes and you're left saying "Wait... that's it?!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyday something happens and every incident always involves multiple viewpoints from a party of people; and we always have to rely on those viewpoints to piece together the truth. This film is another of those under the radar gems, that is one of my favorite suspense thrillers.I like the plot, it's simple and seems plausible who's to honestly say this can't happen; but at the same time slightly complex. And I like that because I feel it's a great balance where they take a simple assassination premise but also add more to it without being over bogged on the details.It's true there isn't a great deal of depth with the characters or even some of the plot. But that's the point, this is a film that takes place right now, this is about a mere some of time and taking action immediately whether were ready or not. That's contributes to the pacing which is fast and just right. The action is good even though there isn't a great deal of it since it is more of suspense thriller, but this film has two very good chase sequences one on foot and the other by car, I really liked the cinematography and the use of the Italy location in those sequences.Two characters stand out that I liked despite like I said not a great deal of depth. Dennis Quaid as Thomas Barnes I thought was a good protagonist, whom is sympathetic due to suffering a bit of post traumatic stress from an assassination attempt he prevented, he is worring if he even has it in him anymore, but I like the fact he does his job despite what he feels. Forest Whitaker as Howard Lewis is pretty much a mere tourist at the wrong place at the wrong time, whom is playing the good Samaritan role whether he wants to or not.The true joy of this film for me is in it's multi perspective format, I wouldn't say this is anything exactly new but it's everything done right (in my book anyway). The film is basically a jigsaw puzzle which is great because I love puzzles; all the pieces are scattered and were just trying to put all of the pieces together to make sense of the structure. It's basically the cause and effect principle where were constantly going back to one point of view to provide us reason as to how this or that happened.This also creates another part of the suspense where in some points of view were a step ahead of the other character, and were hoping that somehow that character will be able to figure out what we already know on time, which is something their running out of.Vantage Point is worth viewing.Rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Non stop electrifying as well as explosive action from start to finish will leave you in a state of shock well after the movie "Vantage Point" is over. With enough cars chase scenes and crashes, mostly without computer enhancement, that can fill as much as half a dozen "French Connection" and "Bullet" movies and still have something left over as well. The film starts at an major anti-terrorism summit conference in Salamanca Spain that US President Ashton, William Hurt, is to be the key note speaker of. Before President Ashton can open his mouth to give his speech before thousands of cheering spectators he's suddenly hit by two bullets, fired from a building in Salamanca Plaza, and left for dead. As all hell breaks loose after Ashton's attempted or in fact successful assassination a bomb goes off leaving the plaza littered with dozens in the crowd dead and wounded!It's secret service agent Thomas Barnes, Dennis Quaid, who just returned from a serious injury he suffered six months ago when he took a bullet for President Ashton who smells a rat in all this and feels it was an inside job not one that's been, by the news media, exclusively attributed to a spin-off Al-Qeada terrorist group located in Morocco. It's from this point on that we get to see from some half dozen different vantage points of what really happened who those behind it. And what we get to see is what the late Senator Joseph McCarthy once described in his famous statement, about communist infiltration in the US State Department, "A Conspiracy so Immense" that it will knock your socks off!****SPOILERS***Incredible action scenes that never let up for a moment and eventually lead to those behind the assassination or attempted assassination of President Ashton. Were in for a number of big surprise as the movie slowly lets us in to what's really happening with Agent Barnes risking his life time after time until he gets to the bottom of what's really going on behind the scenes in the film which is far more then meets the eye. By the time he finally uncovers the elaborate plan that this terrorist group had planned and tried to carry out almost the entire cast of the movie as well as terrorist organization members themselves have been almost totally wiped out! P.S We can't forget perennial movie good guy Forest Whitaker as American tourist Howard Lewis who with his camcorder filmed the spot, as the shooter went into action, where the attempted assassin of President Ashton got off his two shots. Not only did the meek and what at first non heroic looking Lewis uncover those who attempted to murder the President of the United States but also later in the movie saved little Anna (Alice Zaplen), whom earlier he bought an ice cream cone for, from being run over on a busy highway from a runaway van that the mastermind of this whole assassination plot,who was having it out with Agent Barnes, was driving!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rashômon Meets Tom &amp; Jerry !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Hollywood fun, with uncommon flavor.Showing different viewpoints for one thing (or one accident for that matter) is an old trick, done in old movies like Rashômon (1950), with deep concepts to generate. Then the time games have become a fashion in modern commercial cinema after Tarantino's crime movies Reservoir Dogs (1992), Pulp Fiction (1994), and Jackie Brown (1997), with mostly a final twist. Now (Vantage Point) comes to utilize this and that.If you want to ask, rather philosophize, why? Then it might be for meaning like : it needs many to beat the enemy, or no one has alone a perfect vantage point,.. etc. but don't fatigue yourself, because originally this movie wasn't busy making anything serious. And these techniques were used just to make another action thriller.The format of showing 10-minutes visual witness, then pausing it to showing another 10-minutes visual witness yet form another viewpoint is smart; not only for being different, but for providing a nice suspense, with giving away every time a piece of the puzzle, to reveal step by step who the criminal, or the gang of criminals, is. Honestly, in terms of "whodunit" this is the most unusual format I have seen since Memento (2000).It has many stars, lovely pace, fine editing, wonderful cinematography, catchy music, solid action and thrill. However the characters are one step ahead Tom &amp; Jerry's. There is no insistence, or no time, to deepen whatever. Main theme is something this movie doesn't have or ? certainly ? doesn't want to have. I always see that pastime is good, but pastime with meaning is better. So I hated to gather all of these important actors to speak, run and smile at the end ! I was sad the most over Sigourney Weaver; well, that's a cameo, not a respectable role you fraud publicity !After 9 years of directing TV movies or series, Pete Travis assured that he can do Hollywood flicks. That car chase is unforgettable. However all the computer generated backgrounds or explosions wasn't well; in other words it was a shame ! Playing some shots backwards, which ends every segment, was useless and boring, as long as there is already on-screen clock to clear up the start of every new viewpoint. I felt someone silly enjoys rewinding the movie every now and then.Don't talk about acting in fares like this, simply who would judge a singing voice in a sea of carnival ? (So how about carnival with only music !). Dennis Quaid is the memorable moment; his intense performance was more powerful than the rest's performances and characters. Look at the character of President Ashton. Sure it mirrors the Americans' big hope towards another president else George W. Bush, especially in 2008, namely after 8 years of his stupidity and violence, and right in the year of the new presidential election. Still, that wise peaceful President Ashton who refuses meeting violence with violence is too imaginary compared to reality !(Vantage Point) is sheer pastime, with no thoughts allowed. So those techniques worked for making an uncommon flavor. And as someone told me earlier before watching the movie : "Enjoy the car chase".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dynamic, multi-angled thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A real messy mix of a film. It begins with the assassination of the President and a subsequent bomb attack in Spain; the story then rewinds and unfolds as it is shown from the perspective of multiple "vantage points" of participants who happen to be at the scene. As each strand comes to a close, having brought a further understanding of what's taken place, the film rewinds in time to present yet another perspective.The film's idea was, of course, first utilised by Akira Kurosawa in RASHOMON, but VANTAGE POINT is an entirely different spin on the same subject, making use of modern technology to present its story in a fresh and interesting way. Although some of the twists and developments are fairly unbelievable, I felt I was seeing something new ? which is getting unusual with films these days. Unfortunately, at around the halfway point, the movie finishes telling that particular story and then muddles in some perfunctionary subsequent events, involving well-shot car chases, terrorist cells and traitors. It's not bad, but too heavily indebted to the look and style of the Greengrass BOURNE films.The ensemble cast is impressive but lesser than the sum of its parts. Bland actors like Matthew Fox and William Hurt are given plenty of screen time while Forest Whitaker and in particular Sigourney Weaver are wasted in minor roles. Dennis Quaid has a major turn as a presidential bodyguard, but seems to be aping Harrison Ford for the majority of the film. The non-American actors (Edgar Ramirez, Said Taghmaoui and Dolorez Heredia) give the most authentic turns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promised much but ran out of courage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This promises much but fails to deliver. The twists are too obvious and merely casually thrown to the least intelligent section of moviegoers. At the beginning the 'liberal' writer gets a few side swipes at right wing arrogant US attitudes and the 'War on Terror,' - OK but what promises to be a tricky, is what you are seeing the truth or just one biased perspective, puzzler turns into a shoot 'em up, car chasing, one has been good American saving the day, 'Stars and Stripes forever, not very believable thriller! As is now well known, the film is eight reruns of the same events through several different characters' perspectives. But when at the second rerun or so, the Dennis Quaid character sees something on the TV tapes and looks shocked (the obvious key to the whole plot) and the audience is not allowed to see it, then it just seems a cheat, and I switched off thinking about any subtleties and just went along for the ride,... which turned out pretty mediocre. Of course, lots of Americans get killed, by someone being blackmailed!! No wonder it did not do great at the box office, but what really killed it off was not the terribly predictable last twist, but Dennis Quaid getting out a damaged car from a collision that would have killed and mangled anyone inside! I thought Governor Arnie had finished off that preposterous notion when he stepped off the screen into real life a decade ago! But no, American superheroes really do exist on screen to win the War on Terror!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too thin a plot and the bad guy was obvious from the beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole idea of showing the exact same act of terror from different peoples Vantage points sounded cool. But the truth is, that the only real plot of the film is the act of terror and the kidnapping of the president and the car-chase. You take away those seven repetitions, all you have is about 30 minutes, which would be only a little more running time than a short-film. It seems like the screenwriter had written a way too short script and that they tried to compensate for that by showing the same part of the movie 8 times in a row before the big car-chase. It really seems that way and not like they intended for the movie to be made like this. Forest Whitakers character is annoying (he is always annoying) and his presence in the film is completely useless. Sure Dennis Quaid sees the bad guy on the tape, but other than that he adds nothing to the plot. And the co-called plot is so unbelievable that its an insult. Several characters motivations for their actions are never explained. Like the Spanish cop, who is chased and gunned down by the really stupid Secret Service agents AFTER they find out he is a cop. And those agents would never fire their weapons into a huge crowd of people just to kill one guy. Then there is Matthew Foxes character. He is the main bad guy. Something that I guessed within the first 20 minutes and I was right. Apparently the leader of the bad-guys that kidnaps the president. But why is it that he speaks Spanish all of a sudden?? What is his motivations for his crimes?? Fox is a great actor but his talent is completely wasted here. His character is not appearing enough in the film to make any sense. And that is too bad, because I had rented the movie because of him. He is so great in Lost but like I said, completely wasted here. Dennis Quaid is 54 years old. And we're suppose to believe he can still be an active agent?? He looks old and tired and the fact the he singlehandedly can save the president, is completely ridiculous. As for William Hurt as the president: I am so sick of the oh so heroic movie-presidents taking matters into their own hands and fighting badguys. That would NEVER happen in real life. I know the American audience loves it when their president is some kind of an action-hero but he is not. He is just a politician and a very moronic one at that, if we talk about Bush. And presidents are not suppose to pick fights with people trying to kill them. That's the Secret Service agents jobs. But in this movie they're all so stupid and moronic, except for Quaids character, that the president has no choice. Hurts character should have been killed in the ambulance after he made it flip over. That would have been realistic. Whern I think of it there is not a single likable character in this film. As for the badguys whole kidnapping: it could never have happened in real life, but if it had happened, the badguys would have killed the president. They would have been caught. But they would still have succeeded. Especially since were suppose to believe that those highly trained agents who are probably all former Seals or something, can be taken out as easily as in this movie. A movie this can easily be compared to is The Kingdom. A great realistic movie based on something that happened in real life with great acting and likable characters. I'm still waiting for a movie where the badguys get away with killing Americans, because that's what happens in real life. And this movie wants so badly to have a sense of reality to it.But it fails miserably on every level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was truly dreadful, made worse by the good cinematography and occasional excellent acting, which simply made the dreadfulness of the premise and the plot more glaring. Does nobody ever question this stuff before it's released? All the way through I was waiting for the clever plot twist that would show the whole thing to have been an ETA plot cunningly set up to undermine the viewer's assumptions about Islamic extremist terrorism etc. Nope. The moral of the story is that the US secret service rules the world, kills the bad guys, rescues the good guys, and spare Americans save the little children.Why, in a European city, do the US secret service appear to have absolute jurisdiction and the freedom to shoot Spanish police? On what planet would a small Spanish-speaking child trust a fat American non-Spanish speaking stranger over a Spanish uniformed police officer? Why, while we're ranting, would any Islamic extremist "pop up" in both Beirut and Darfur? Have any of the writers read a newspaper recently? Does anyone involved in the film have a clue? And this is before we even get near the gaping plot holes (terrorist pats small child on the head who he is prepared to kill, then the entire ending rests on the same terrorist abandoning his whole plan in order to not kill the same small child). Not to mention the painful comedy acting by everyone except Forest Whittaker and the atrocious dialogue that actually had this sofa laughing out loud towards the end.Without any doubt the worst film I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vantage Point reminds me of matrix part1 when some people left the cinema in the first 20 minutes because they did not understand the plot and said what a load of rubbish. Well if you think that a plot of a film should be something like Tom has a gun, he shoots,people die,the police is chasing him,they catch him, the end,don't bother go to watch the film.I had a couple in front of me at the cinema that was getting nervous because they didn't understand what was going on.I don't know, flashbacks for some people seem to be difficult to understand.I'm also grateful for watching this movie because once again it reminded me one of the most basic things in cinema.DO NOT TAKE SERIOUSLY critics reviews.When i saw the trailer on the internet i thought it must be good.Then i read some reviews that buried the film(fortunately not all of them) and i started to have second thoughts about watching it.Thank God i decided to go and watch it and once again i realise how much film critics are so out of touch.I wonder how many good movies i have missed relying on film reviews.It's an action film with a very good cast and a excellent direction.

		<shortDescription>One of the best ideas for a movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vanatge Point was such an amazing movie. I don't even know where to start. It was so entertaining. The action in this movie was so intense and will keep you right on the edge of your seat the whole movie. From the very first five minutes of this movie I knew that it was going to be good. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole hour and a half. It was a pretty short movie. There was barely any flaws for this movie. I think that they could have explained a little more why the people in this movie were doing what they were doing to the president. If you think you know what is going on in this movie, you definitely don't until the very end. The acting was so good. I don't know why people keep making fun of the acting. It was very well acted between all the cast members. I thought that the cast was so brilliant and couldn't have been better. There was also so much action in this movie surprisingly. When I had first seen the previews to this movie I didn't think I would like it. I was definitely wrong about not liking this movie though. It was so perfect, I thought that everything was done perfectly. The car chase scene at the end was so intense, and kept you right on the edge of your seat. I thought that the idea for this movie was great. I have never seen anything like this movie and think that it's good they made something like this. With each different peoples point of views you find a lot more about the story. The story just kept getting better and better as the movie went on. So if you are looking for lots of heart pounding action this movie is perfect for you. Definitely just give this movie a chance and see it, you wont be disappointed. When the movie was over I never wanted it to end it was so good. I just wanted to stay and watch some more pulse pounding action. Dennis Quaid played such a great role in this and made it even better than it already was. I thought that everyone got an even amount of screen time. I also loved how this movie took place in Spain. I thought that it was perfect rewinding after each peoples point of views were done. They showed each one for about 23 minutes and then rewound to 11:59. This was by far one of the best action movies ever, it was so fast-paced. I thought that the trailer to this movie was sort of bad. The movie was so much better than what the trailer makes it out to be. Overall this is such a great action movie. I think anyone who likes heart racing action movies should see this one. Trust me, take my word for it you wont be disappointed and it is so worth it. Just one last thing this movie was simply amazing. Go see it especially for someone who likes action thrillers. Im still shocked I liked it as much as I did. Go see it and enjoy it.</fullReview>

If you want to see the same 5 minutes of a movie 7 times, (which includes listening to a boring speech!) rush to the theater, this is your movie. Oh don't worry when the movie finally moves past the first five minutes it will leave all kinds of unanswered questions and end in the corniest way since the corny endings started back in the seventies. "Thank you Tom", said the President. "Your welcome Sir" said Dennis Quad, (a foot to short and 20 years too old for the part).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An attempted assassination form 8 points of View.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This films is an intriguing concept on paper but like communism in real life it just does not work. Its about two service agents who are trying to prevent an assassination. This would be a good film if it wasn't split into 8 parts. Unfortunately it is repetitive to the N'th degree we see an explosion 8 times, which significantly ruins the affect the explosion is meant to have on you. The acting is great in fact that is the only reason I've given it a 5 out of 10! it would have been a 3 out of 10 but Forest Whitaker,Dennis Quaid and Zoe Saldana brilliantly put across the affect of a terrorist attack.The story is overall frustrating because it keeps dropping little cliffhangers in every so often then rewinding back to the start. Finally at the end everything is finally cut together as it should have been all the way through, the action is smooth and adrenaline filled,if you can stand being in the cinema for the first 3/4 you'll love the last quarter. And there is a pleasant twist at the end. I Hope My Comment Was useful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vacuous, glorified TV movie, not even smart enough to be considered propaganda.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Art (and i use that word very loosely) has always dealt with the issues and conflicts of the times, terrorism is one such issue, one that affects people worldwide and should be featured in the movie medium, to present the effects it has upon peoples beliefs, values and institutions, to ultimately give hope in uncertain times. Vantage Point, however, does no such thing. The word 'terrorist' here is used, just as 'Communist' or 'Russian' was during the Cold War, simply to provide studios with a new villain. This, though, does not mean it cannot be a good movie, rather, it is a combination of many other glaring deficiencies that results in a 3 out of 10 movie. The narrative, for instance, told in Rashomon style, showing a terrorist attack from several view points, fails to provide several different perspectives of the events, instead simply repeating the same occurrences except with a new cliff hanger to be resolved at the end. Why? Because Vantage Point is a misplaced TV movie. It employs similar techniques as Matthew Fox's day job, Lost. Yet, these elements of suspense serve to guarantee repeat viewers, therefore high ratings on Lost, where as for Vantage Point their only purpose is to stretch a 23 minute story to feature length. The narrative quickly becomes more tiresome than interesting, reiterating the lack of ideas that went into this film. Furthermore, plot holes litter this film, which i wont bore you with, but if you really want to investigate into them, there are plenty of discussions on the boards. Finally though, it is the stupidity of the characters (and also the makers) of Vantage Point that calcifies its status as one to avoid. The film exists in a universe where it doesn't matter how many people die, if the President is OK, everything else is too, but this hollow message is undermined further considering how ineffectual the President actually is. His actions provoke hostility from both sides of the political spectrum, and cost potentially thousands of lives, but does he learn from his mistakes and re-evaluate his approach to tackle terrorism? No, is the simple answer, which is why Vantage Point is such a terrific waste of time, it doesn't restore your faith in humanity, it destroys it.</fullReview>

It would have been a nightmare to film and have the audience follow. I'm not 100% sure that I understood the movie plot. But, I'll see it again when it releases on DVD. I was happy to see a lot of my favorite stars in the movie. Dennis Quaid looked REALLY old!! See what happens when you leave a wife like Meg Ryan?!!

		<shortDescription>Tedious Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point is a unique film that suffers from the very thing that makes it unique. Seeing events unfold from several different "vantage points" sounds clever but, in reality, it seemed tedious and shallow. NONE of the characters have any possibility for development in this format. When any emotion or character development is attempted (ex: Forest Whitaker's character) it seems unnecessary and blatantly hammered in to the wrong place. Another problem is that each rewind offers no clues you can follow or solve. Everything is revealed over time but it's presented to you, there's no intrigue. The pace was crisp and the car chase was thrilling (even if totally implausible) but the resolution was far too convenient to sell. Overall, a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Like "What Was The Point?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank You! Those were the 2 words that I uttered as the credits rolled after 1 hour and 42 minutes of this so called action thriller. Why you ask? Because first, I was so glad that it finally ended and second, I'm glad my friend payed for my ticket and saved me from wasting my money. Don't get me wrong, I'm not the type of guy who usually bashes movies as I always tend to look at the positive and enjoy the entertainment values even though the majority of film might be poor (like action, special effects etc.) But I can honestly say that Vantage Point was a bad film overall, leaving a lot to be desired and wasted too much building suspense when there wasn't much in the first place.Let's start with the acting. Now here you have a very good cast of A-listers/Oscar winners no less (Dennis Quaid, Matthew Fox, Forest Whitaker, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver) yet the performances are nothing more than mediocre. I was very shocked as these veteran actors seemed to be going through the motions in their performances. But then I realized by the end of the film it wasn't the actors who were lacking, it was material given to them. Sigourney Weaver is probably given one of the worst roles of her career as a TV Producer in charge of CNN's live coverage of the President's meeting with the leaders of Spain is awful. She's only in one scene and she seems bored in the role. William Hurt doesn't convince as the President of the United States, Matthew Fox hardly convinces as an agent for the Secret Service and Dennis Quiad's inner struggle throughout the film never really holds your interest. Even Forest Whitaker seems like he rather be else where as his performance as a tourist turned hero is quite laughable. Also, who thought it was a great casting choice for Zoe Saldana to play a TV reporter? Luckily, she is only in one scene, which is also unintentionally funny. The only actors who seem to truly commit to the film are the relatively unknown : Edgar Ramirez, Sa?d Taghmaoui, Ayelet Zurer and Eduardo Noriega who all make the terrorist group after the President give good performances making them the only redeeming quality of the film.Like I said, the script was lacking, not too mention having some of the most cringe worthy and cheesiest lines of the year. "I've got you Mr. President", "Thank you Barnes", "Thany you sir" left me tilting my head down thinking, "Wow, where haven't we heard that before?" Also, it's probably has been said many times before but the constant rewinding to introduce yet another perspective got so repetitive and redundant that you quickly lost interest in the film. "Ohh my God!" and "Are you serious?" were some of the many annoyed responses during the countless rewinding. 1, yes! 2, of course! 3 no problem! But 8! Beyond ridiculous! When the film actually starts playing out after revealing it's big twist (while decent, it was too little too late) is becomes a cliché action movie with a over long chase scenes and shoot out between the bad guy and the hero. What's even funnier is how convenient everything seems during the climax as well as when the film tries to be all dramatic and intense it feels even cornier than it is.Again, I don't mean to sound like a basher but I'm just stating the facts. So what's my Vantage Point you say? A movie with such an original(ish) plot and refreshing concept, it's all poorly executed. It's sub-par acting, cheesy script and tedious action make it only slightly better than your typical Steven Seagal action flick!</fullReview>

The one good thing in the movie was the chase sequence. The five diff point of views were good, but after 2 of them, one would get bored to see the rest as there was nothing drastically different between each one of them.

First the luck that Quaid's character just happens to see something on the cameras. Second the final crash is just completely blind luck. There was no reason for that crash and if it had not have happened the operation would have been a success. And finally everything that Quaid does has no barring on the plot whatsoever. It all comes down to the final crash with which he has absolutely nothing to do.On top of that several things didn't make sense. For one, why did Matthew Fox stop to pick up that guy even though he knew that guy was going to be killed. He could have killed him himself right from the start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Cast Wasted in a Silly, Self-Serious, Implausible Car Chase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scenes of "Vantage Point" gripped me. Sigourney Weaver as Rex Brooks (what a name), a CNN-style news producer, is covering an international summit in Spain. She's sparring with her on screen reporter, a younger, prettier, African American woman. The reporter wants to comment on anti-American sentiment at the summit and Weaver is telling her, in no uncertain terms, to can it.There's a fascinating movie there: the tension between an older, less attractive, but powerful and intelligent white producer and her hotshot reporter. Weaver acts it to the hilt. I cared about her. I was intrigued by her. I wanted to follow her story. When her cameras capture a shocking event, Weaver's face registers real horror, and yet she gets a grip on herself and tries to continue producing the broadcast, in order that "the people may know." Dennis Quaid, as a Secret Service agent with a past, breaks into the broadcasting booth. What a story Quaid and Weaver could have acted together. William Hurt is in the movie too; one of Weaver's former co-stars. What a treat it would be to see these two veterans spar off each other. And there is also Oscar winner Forest Whitaker, as an estranged American dad traveling through Spain, his camera at the ready. What a cast! Forget it. The excellent cast is wasted. The movie turns into an extended, utterly implausible series of car chases and gun fights. Action movies aren't supposed to be believable, but "Vantage Point" takes itself very seriously as an exploration of terrorism and America's response to it. The combination of completely unbelievable action, Byzantine plot ? 9-11 has shown that terrorists don't need to infiltrate the American power structure as they do here in order to create chaos ? and pomposity makes "Vantage Point" more laughable ? and not in a good way -- than entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A manipulative mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Salamanca, Spain, the president of the US is going to have a big meeting to fight against terrorism. The president suffers an assassination attempt so the film show how different persons watch that event and how anybody can change the destiny of the others.I must say that i doesn't have any desires to watch this popcorn film but a few days ago we couldn't arrive right on time to watch "There Will Be Blood" and this film was just perfect for that time. Anyway, i think "Vanteg Point" is an entertaining mess easy to forget, the typical Hollywood big product. The plot is good and the way the story is told too but is very hypocrite and manipulative showing the US as a country that wants peace and the rest are the "bads" of the story. But just remember what country is in war right now. I found incredible how they shot the film in Mexico City, i imagine the producers thinking "Mexico is very cheap and must look just like Spain", i know that my country is cheaper to make a film but i found very fake and dull how in the same scene they show the modern subway of Mexico City with old colonial builds as background.Conclusion: this film is an manipulative mess, is not a clever thriller and neither a great action film with memorable characters. How this bodyguard can survive after an amazing car chase, i mean he is not Superman or John MacClane. I don't recommend this film, with the worst performance of Whitaker, and i put it 5 just because is quite entertaining. 5 out of 10</fullReview>

After being addicted and highly entertained by the full throttle excitement of the awesome Bourne Series, this film left a really bad taste in our mouths. And the shaky camera bit didn't help to stylize this film in the least. It just made it, as well as those terrible "let's go back to 11:59" moments, tedious and tired. Two words: Skip it.

The movie strains credulity to the maximum with no benefit to the viewer. The following are a few reasons to not attend: 1. Horrible dialog. 2. No character development or back-story explaining anyone's actions. 3. Totally ridiculous Secret Service actions (for example, a known threat to the President, would have led to immediate cancellation of the meeting, not using a double!). 4. A Secret Service agent who is a double agent who passes all background checks and polygraph exams for 10 years! Please. And there is no apparent motivation for helping the terrorists. 5. In a sea of cameras and video recorders, the one containing the "evidence" is conveniently spotted by the good agent. 6. Small compact cars that sustain collisions that would disable cars in a demolition derby. 7. A terrorist swerves to avoid a young girl after he has killed hundreds of people leading to a convenient conclusion. 8. "Rewinds" that are more annoying than enlightening. I started rooting for the terrorists after the 4th one!There are many other reasons not to bother with this one. Just check out the message boards. If you want to see a great presidential assassination thriller, rent "In the Line of Fire" and avoid this turd. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This attempt at perceptual twists doesn't quite tie up in the end, like another contemporary movie, ATONEMENT which is able to just use two different perspectives to a much greater affect. Nevertheless, the attempt at different viewers is interesting and GROUNDHOG day reminiscent. The is plenty of action and the different threads eventually merge together in some television script reasonableness. There are elements from the television series 24, the real time action strong. Yet by the end, the singular fate-like elements doesn't quite have the punch that the build up leads up to. The chase scenes somewhat pale in comparison to THE BOURNE IDENTITY, BOURNE SUPREMACY, not quite realistic enough. Signourney Weaver's thread seems to literally disappear in the movie and several of the threads seem to either cheat on the perspective of the individual being experienced or else piggy-backed on, especially towards the end. Nevertheless, the movie is high energy, rapid pace, consistent, and reasonably satisfying. If only the psychological drama had been able to be played out to the greater effect, instead of turning the movie more into the more by the technically interesting numbers game - pushing the American envelope by how duped the Secret Service is - such a scenario is more of a 24 television plot point than a major movie script plot. Seven out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

And worst of all, not only bad quality, but also no sense, boring and...another American movie. They also don't leave Dennis Quaid any place to play, cause he spend all the time running with a high speed car and a gun in the hand, prosecuting "bad guys", that are Spanish or Moroccans, it isn't very clear, but if you know Spanish you will see that no one but E.Noriega hat Spanish accent. So, as a conclusion, don't waste your time with this film.</fullReview>

It takes a gimmick (showing the same event from the view point of several protagonists), but cannot get over congratulating itself on this fact, to the extent of literally pushing the rewind button to take you back to the start... not just once, but over, and over, and over. (and over).It is implausible (Spanish security really let a guy into close proximity with 150 world leaders carrying a gun and a bag of explosives on the flash of a badge?), and ultimately pointless (yes, the president is saved..., but there is no political comment, no analysis of the motives of the bombers "but why", Quaid says to the turned-Secret Service agent... there is no reply (because no one had time to actually think about that crucial element: there is no why in this mindless piece of nonsense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Outdoor Summit for the sake of a Photo-Op</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The malevolent forces of Islamic terrorism have one sophisticated plan to foil an international summit where President William Hurt is about to sign a treaty with several nations. It's more of a photo-op than a summit; it looks like agreement's been reached for some new cooperation against terrorism. But the jihadists have something in the works.I'm still trying to figure out why not only our president but several other unnamed world leaders are left in harm's way for the sake of some publicity. Sign the treaty and send out a press release.All hell breaks loose as William Hurt is shot as he reaches the podium and after that a bomb goes off in the city center of Salamanca, Spain where all this is happening. It's only gradually after seeing the events from eight different perspectives that the whole story unfolds.It was an interesting concept, but really far fetched. In fact the only reason the bad guys get as far as they do is because they have some inside help. I'll say no more.Dennis Quaid is the intrepid Secret Service agent who puts the whole thing together literally on the run. Best in the film for me is news producer Sigourney Weaver and innocent American tourist bystander Forest Whittaker who in my humble opinion is the real hero of the piece.Interesting this title was chosen for the film. Vantage Point was the title of the presidential memoirs of Lyndon B. Johnson. One of the dullest reads for presidential writing ever. But LBJ's view of the policies he followed had nothing on unreality as this film does.</fullReview>

I'm amazed half the cast didn't walk away from this production.VERTIGO ALERT!! I want to warn those who get carsick watching shaky camera action to avoid "Vantage Point." In terms of causing dizziness, headache, carsickness, etc., "Vantage Point" is a doozie. I had to make a run for the exit about a third of the way through the movie because of intense motion sickness from watching nonstop hand-held camera scenes. The damn movie left me nauseated for the rest of the night.When will theaters post warnings to those of us who get vertigo watching shaky camera scenes in movies?

		<fullReview>Before you see this great movie, get your snacks, restroom breaks etc out of the way, and then pay close attention. You do not want to miss anything at all. Far and away, one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I left the theater,and I was amazed at the great camera work, acting and direction. While there is violence, it is not a blood and gore type of film, and the PG-13 rating is accurate. It may be a bit much for viewers younger than 13, depending on the childs maturity level. Go see it, you will have a ball! If you gossip or are easily distracted, you could miss an important part of movie and that would lessen enjoyment of the movie overall. Don't let anyone spoil it by trying to tell you about it and it will be a lot more fun. I just might go see it again.....just in case I missed something! This is destined to be a box office hit, and also a big DVD seller because it is a "keeper".</fullReview>

Grade A casting; Dennis Quaid is back on top baby! (And it proves a solid story can still be told in under 1hr 30mins!) I'll put this up against the "Bourne" movies any day. Go! So, that was the end of my review but IMDb does not believe in brevity, I have to write more. Six lines is not enough, has to be ten. What ever happened to less is more?

Before I went to go watch it I read the comments from here to see what people had to say and wasn't too excited anymore. But still none the less I went and saw and still I loved it! All of the actors do a great job portraying their characters and everything in the end all fits together. Twists in the plot through out the movie happen that you never could have never predicted or saw coming.And yes it does get a little annoying with the movie physically stopping and then rewinding back to the exact same time that day five times but that is kind of the plot of the whole movie. 8 strangers and 8 different vantage points kind of means that you have to go back and see how each of those people witnessed it and what they experienced.All and all its a great movie with suspense, drama, and most importantly ACTION!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gosh what a seductive idea. Gosh what a spasm of waste.The problem is that clever ideas were borrowed and spliced together with no annealing. So we have this business of recorded movies and the movie we watch overlap. The movies within are by Forrest Whitaker and a TeeVee crew managed by Sigourney Weaver. These play no role at all.We have the part that is caper movie, and we see an elaborate plan unfold, complete with remote orchestration by cell phone. But the caper gymnastics are underplayed. On top of that we have the double con: a switcheroo plot set up by the president's men to trick him into a war with Islam, based on an expected terrorist attack is double switcherooed by those terrorists. This is stuff that works only when it is the spine of the thing.We have a classic redemption tale of a tenacious if not bright bodyguard who made a mistake and paid. This is tied to a traditional chase scene. And the thing is set up as a "21 Grams" sort of intersection of parallel lives and coincident fates. You can just see the writer, frustrated by rejection because his scripts don't have this or that depending on who is rejecting. You can just imagine him deciding one day to mash everything up and as long as it will be colorful (so it needs Latin energy) all will be well.You will already know that this film is not considered a success. We could have had "Snake Eyes" and "Rashomon." We could have had focus, fun, adventure. Nope. Doesn't work.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything about this movie just plain stinks. I was so excited to see this movie I have seen the trailers for a long time and have been waiting for it for some time. The all star cast did not perform well. The acting was sub par. The plot was shallow. If you like movies with substance and intrigue then this is not for you. If you like to be spoon fed all the answers and LOVE summer blockbusters then it is the movie for you. The character development was non existent, the movie was so repetitive.I read another one of the reviews on here that said if you like the movie Run Lola Run then you will like Vantage Point. Well I am here to say that I loved Run Lola Run and found this movie to be simply awful. It is one thing to have the same sequence of events with different choices made as in Run Lola Run, But to have the same sequence of events with basically no alterations in it at all is just plain lazy film making.This script was originally intended for a 24 season and would have been much better served to have been that because they would have done it justice. The basic scenario of this movie is great but the delivery was terrible. Don't see this movie if you are a movie buff and enjoy independent films with substance. There's no substance here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome. I really wanted to see that scene another 8 times.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll try to avoid hyperbole here, but bear with me as it is a difficult task to do so.Vantage Point is an attempt, note attempt, to create a mystery-thriller along the lines of the Bourne series that drew much critical acclaim. In terms of camera work and rather confusing and disorienting action sequences, the movie does stay very true to that concept. What is missing, however, is a compelling plot, interesting or even marginal dialogue, and any sense of actual thrill. Not giving away too much, the movie will lead you through nearly an hour and fifteen minutes of the exact same events, from only minutely different points of view. Not only is the entire concept implemented poorly, but it is largely irrelevant to the actual plot or character development, and only serves to draw out a 24-like episode into a terrible and agonizingly dull movie. After watching the first iteration of events from the GNN (Original news station names are getting more creative by the day), the viewer will have to sit through recitations of the same events that do not, and I stress this, add to the movie at all. There is no sense of dramatic revelation, unless you consider the Scooby Doo series to be dramatic. Unfortunate too, because the last 15 or so minutes create a decent thrill that could have made for a nice TV movie on the Hallmark channel.Speaking of that, I would have preferred to sit through a Walker, Texas Ranger marathon; at least you'd get a change of scenery every 30 minutes.Verdict: Do not see this movie unless you really enjoy plot regurgitation, in which case you should also get some help.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Combine a TV director and a screenplay from a first timer and usually one of two things happen: magic or mess. This is just a mess. Very little suspense and the look and feel of an episode of "24".A very good cast with ridiculous material and so many just plain stupid and unbelievable things happening that I can only assume this was written with junior high kids as the target audience. After the third segment, I felt a twinge of dread every time that 11:59 clock popped up in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. Compare that to the air of anxiety as Phil Conners alarm clock flips in "Groundhog Day".I won't list every ridiculous moment, but let's just focus on Dennis Quaid's character. That guy is involved in two car wrecks, either of which would have sent him to the hospital and would have left his car undriveable ... especially considering it is little more than a toy car! The second one is truly beyond belief. After being slammed into a building by a large truck, he kicks out the windshield and chases down the bad guys. Oh yeah, he does have a scratch on his cheek. Please.William Hurt and Forest Whitaker somehow maintain their dignity despite this material, but Matthew Fox, Bruce McGill and Sigourney Weaver certainly don't. They deserve better, as do Edgar Ramirez and Zoe Saldana.It is pretty rare that I can't find something in a movie that makes it worthwhile, but this one is just a high dollar film project with no heart, soul or spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Changing the Point of View Doesn't Make This Movie Any Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What could have been a reasonably entertaining B-movie is instead turned into a total disaster.Here's the gimmick: the events in "Vantage Point" unfold multiple times from the perspectives of different characters. Each time we see the story, we either learn something we didn't know before, or the movie tosses us a new twist for a subsequent story to unravel. If this were made as a film noir back in the 1950s, it would have been a modest, slick little film with a clever narrative device. But blown up to Hollywood action movie proportions, with a big cast of good and wasted actors, and pretensions to some sort of intelligent commentary about the way we perceive our fragmented world, the movie stinks.A movie like this must have absolutely perfect editing, but the editing in "Vantage Point" is terrible. The first hour of the film is repetitive; I grew quickly tired of the film rewinding itself to start over every ten minutes. The filmmakers must have grown tired of it too, because the last half hour is told through no particular point of view, and is so badly edited that nothing makes much sense. The action in "Vantage Point" never stops, yet the whole things feels oddly inert and boring. All of the characters are given back stories told in short hand to give us a reason to care about them, but the stories are hackneyed, like something high schoolers would have written. And it doesn't help that the dialogue, especially that reserved for the swarthy terrorists who put the film's action in motion, sounds like the stuff you hear on those telenovelas that air on Telemundo.This movie is a perfect example of what happens when a stupid action movie tries to be smarter than it is. From whichever point of view you choose, "Vantage Point" still sucks.Grade: D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Substitutes structure for substance, but still not a bad film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point is an pretty straight forward action flick masquerading as some sort of intricate thriller. These filmmakers use a storytelling device to make you think you're seeing something much more complicated than it actually is, which only becomes a problem at the end when you realize that all the seeming complexity was nothing but smoke and mirrors. It still manages to be entertaining as long as you don't dwell on how much of the movie was just treading water and how many ultimately important characters are about as shallow as a swimming pool filled with Margaret Thatcher's tears.The film is about an assassination attempt on the U.S. President (William Hurt) while he's attending an anti-terrorism summit in Spain. The President is shot, bombs go off and we see the whole thing play out from the perspective of several different characters. First, we see it all through the eyes of the production crew handling the news coverage of the event. Then it rewinds (literally) and we see it again from the viewpoint of a Secret Service agent (Dennis Quaid). The process gets repeated with a Spanish cop (Eduardo Noriega), an American tourist (Forest Whitaker) and the President before finally getting one last retelling from the vantage point of the instigators of the assassination plot. As the story is repeated, more and more secrets are revealed before concluding in an explosive and unfortunately random fashion.This thing is like Clint Eastwood's "In The Line Of Fire" gussied up to look like Christopher Nolan's "Memento". But whereas Memento's structure served to add depth to the tale, the structure here basically substitutes for depth. If Vantage Point were done in a linear way, the first half of it would have been scenes establishing who everyone is and why they're doing the things they do and the second half would have accelerated into an action-packed sprint. By doing this Rashomon-thing, that first half is eliminated and the audience is instead thrown an explanatory sentence or an allusion when necessary while the plot hurtles along.The result is a very dynamic movie that starts with a bomb going off and gets more energetic from there. This is like a roller coaster, except you ride it over and over and it gets faster each time. It also has an honestly unexpected twist that may come out of left field but works all the same.However, the structure of Vantage Point leads you to expect it to be more intelligent than it is. Let me put it this way, after the main bad guy commits a remote control murder, sets off 2 bombs that kill scores of people and cold bloodedly shoots a helpless hostage dead, his whole scheme is undone because this sociopath balks at running over a little girl while trying to escape in his getaway vehicle. It doesn't make any sense but since it's the only way for things to wrap up with a happy ending, that's what happens. And while there's one twist that is surprising, there's another that any reasonably attentive viewer will spot coming a mile away.It's more style than substance, but Vantage Point is a mildly engaging diversion. As long as you don't let it raise your hopes, you won't be dissatisfied with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the beginning to the very end, I enjoyed every minute of "Vantage Point". It was so cleverly put together and very well done, that the ending just blew me away. It was also a very clever idea. A catastrophic event seen from the point of view of 8 different people. Each vantage point gives you a clue of who is the cause of it all, but never directly. You have to keep guessing and trying to figure it out yourself. And believe me, I tried. But my prediction of who it might be wasn't even close to who it actually turned out to be. I feel this movie is very underrated and those who say it isn't realistic either have watched way too much of CNN news or just wouldn't know a realistic film if it bit them in the butt.Its a MOVIE people. Who cares if it isn't 101% accurate? Not me. Which may be one of the many reasons I enjoyed it so much. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I know there have been worse movies come out so far this year, The Eye or Step Up 2 in example, but I haven't seen those movies because I know they are sh*t, but this movie was a big disappointment! First of all, I went in to this movie thinking that it was not going to just be a bunch of propaganda, but in fact that's all it turned out to be, one if the biggest pieces of propaganda/scare tactics I have seen in a long time...like at least The Kingdom, despite the scare tactics, was an entertaining movie, Vantage Point was boring and lacking of any kind of story. You never find out why the president is being targeted to be killed, nor do you find out who it is that is carrying out the assassination(the group responsible). Also, the movie is presented in a horrible fashion, I felt like I was watching re-runs of 24 over and over again, except 24 is much better then this movie. This was one movie that I actually contemplated walking out on halfway through, by the middle of the movie, I was so tired of watching the same scenes over and over again. Each time the movie switched to another characters vantage point, they show you the exact same 10 minutes that you just saw 10 minutes ago, then they add some small, minuscule new piece of information that isn't even that big of a deal anyways because in no way does it advance the plot of the movie at all...I will give this movie some credit and that is for Forest Whitaker, who is as always the man in every movie he is in. In conclusion, I gave this movie a 3/10 because that is truly all it deserves, I have no idea how this film, if you can even call it a "film", has a 7/10 on IMDb, go to rottentomatoes.com if you want to see a real review for this movie done by critics instead of a rating given by people who don't know what a good movie is, and in my opinion, nothing was good about this movie, one of the worst action/thriller movies I have seen in a while.</fullReview>

Certain characters were ridiculous and unnecessary ( i.e. the little girl). Poor Forrest Whittaker had a silly role in this movie and his acting abilities were wasted.I enjoyed the way the clock restarted at 12:00 for each vantage point I thought it kept things cohesive. While some of the characters were unnecessary this movie still proved to be moderately entertaining with some decent suspense and action scenes. The end is a nice twist but I think this may be a renter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ending Saved Thie Confusing Beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vantage Point is a good adventure movie. The first time around that they show someones "Vantage Point" is cool. Then they show someone else's six times in a row just using different camera angles. My friends and I kept making fun of the whole 11:59 thing. It just kept starting over and over again. Slowly we progress to some new footage and then the movie finally gets good. The climax is very good, because it finally does intertwine all six "Vantage Points" into one. Dennis Quaid is cool and slick as ever, Matthew Fox is a nice surprise, Forest Whitaker as always is a really good actor. Sigorney Weaver is in the film for about 7 minutes, and is a total bitch. Overall not bad. 6 OUT OF 10 PG-13 for Violence, Language, Disturbing and Frigtening Images. At least check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame as Lame can be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the worst film I ever watched. The rewind technique for sequence of events through different perspectives became so redundant and lame that you were annoyed at the film and laughed your way through it. Even through the film you knew what was going to happen. It looked like I was the director and knew what was going to happen after every screen shot. Tasteless. It was poor action that had poor acting and poor dialogue. The trailer made you think one thing and then the movie was not the same. I say C for effort but F for final project. Randy's acting was lame. He probably took the role so to have something to do.Forrest's acting was just so bland and lame that you felt he was just a pest in the movie that was just being taped for being taped sake. The plan of how the plot was done was alright.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the worst movie I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My summary pretty much sums it up. My whole life I have been able to avoid terrible movies like this one, but I watched this one because of the stellar cast; do not follow this example. Stay away from this movie at all costs! It is a waste of time from the beginning to the end. The story is completely implausible, the directing sucks, the dialogue is as bad as it gets, there is pretty much every action cliché contained in the film, and it is all done with the intent of the movie being very serious with itself; in other words, you are not supposed to be laughing. Perhaps the best way to describe it is 24, but with less believability, and infinitely worse, no Jack Bower. This movie is dumber than The Day After Tomorrow, no joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of THE worst movies of all times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>anyone who likes this movie has to be from another planet or a film student. Where do I begin? Horrible acting, an incomprehensible script. The director should be thrown out of the industry, never to appear again. The leads should be ashamed of themselves and send their money back. This goes on my list of bad movies and is easily in the top ten. Life is precious, do not waste your time on this awful awful movie. The useless violence literally dozens --well, it makes me sick. After watching tell no one--a fantastic thriller. The special effects (if thats what they were, were so bad ( even driving down steps) they were laughable. This film should be shown to all film students around the world as a bold example of how really BAD movies can be. It is in fact PURE JUNK&gt;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Vantage Point" is a very good idea executed very poorly. Having the same story shown through 8 different viewpoints eventually solving the puzzle is a neat idea, but this was not neat, it was dumb, with hollow characters and several plots, only a few needed for the main plot.The president has been shot. But who shot him, and why did they do it? Who saw the shooting? Who cares? All but the last question will be answered in this melodramatic game of Clue. What makes this not a great movie is it's characters. The dialogue is clunky and unnatural, and many of the stories are unneeded. Also, the unbelievability factor is high with almost everything, from secret service agents shooting in a crowd, to ruthless killers going as far as killing themselves to avoid hitting someone with their car. The highlights of "Vantage Point" are the car chase scenes, which are sort of pulse pounding even with all these one dimensional characters, and William Hurt as the president, who was just interesting to watch for some reason. Forrest Whittaker was given the raw hand of the deal with the worst dialogue in the film and the most dull character sub-plot. With all the stories and sub-plots, this runs at a mere 82 minutes, which is a blessing in some ways, but also barely seems like a movie. It sounds like I hated this, but I didn't, I sort of liked it. But it was just too average to be good, which is a shame.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 82 mins. PG-13 for violence and language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST constructed and most intense movie I've EVER seen! GO SEE IT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't see another movie in your lifetime, go see this one before you quit. This is the best constructed, edited, and filmed movie I've ever seen. EVER! And I love movies, have seen thousands of them, and write screenplays myself. I was exhausted when I came out. I don't care what anyone says about this movie that is negative, go see for yourself. It was awesome. Again, THE BEST! I think the director, editor, and everyone technical should be nominated for next year's Academy Awards. I was impressed, and most movies simply don't impress me any more. I would give this a 20 out of a possible 10 for intensity from beginning to end. It's a KEEPER!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great concept for a movie, but it has so many plot holes in it you'll be talking about it for days...in a way the producers never intended. So completely implausible, the audience in the theater was snickering at several key points in the film. We are also presented with acting (from some usually reliable actors) and a script straight out of bad television. It's hard to believe that terrific actors like Forest Whitaker and Sigourney Weaver agreed to be in this mess. They are reduced to bit players in a way that makes you wonder if some of their scenes were cut out of the film. And as others have pointed out, many in the theater where I viewed it also began to groan every time another perspective was presented, in an almost identical manner as the last one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What modern movies have come to</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was in the least of sayings horrible. The outlandish type of directing has caused it to be based less on the story but stories. It seemed to be a nightmare through a one tragedy and the replaying of it 4 times over with superimposed images of past events. It was quite a boring thing to watch a movie about 5 times over. The story line was not anything to interesting either. Just another movie to be seen and thrown away because there was no significance to it. Just a waste of time and money due to the lack of creativity of some writers and directors. I say most modern movies have no glare, no deep story line to follow, and many other things. Why would anyone create a movie that is short of a masterpiece? For 11 dollars I believe that this was not even worth half. A senseless movie with some useless plot I say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With every imaginable trickery and cliché to dazzle and dizzy the viewers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story starts off well and does set off expectations of some eventful occurrence, paving the entrances and involvement of a diverse cultural breed of principle characters. And from start to finish, Dennis Quaid exhibits some of his finest hours of performance as Barnes, bringing a perfect contrast to Forest Whitaker's calm and gentile Howard. Oooh, a refreshingly cool format to expect one same event revealed in 8 eye-witnessing accounts.The dizzingly and bouncing virtuosic camera work and the over-use of flashback-scene technique never cease to test my nerves. Action packed, the story rolls at rapid pacing to serve like caffeine for the audience's adrenaline to kick. A horrendously chaotic situation with a confusingly scrumptious multi-colored environment and atmosphere, infused with crowds and crowds of people, secret agents, protesters, activists, and camera crewmen to add to the color. Images are aplenty with characters clinging dearly onto either deadly weapons, or palm pilots, or recording devices, or TV screens as if these machinations provide the only meaningful existence in their terror-saturated, contemporary world. Yep, the story is seeped with multifaceted visual actions and activities, bombs exploding, shootings, panic screams, haphazard movements, mess over mess, to satisfy the pyromaniacs.Director Peter Travis hasn't missed out anything to keep the audience from picking up the film's bloopers, artistic flaws, or weaknesses. Too bad, the stereotyped bad guys, in every imaginable clichéd scenes, are way too predictable. Alas, one phone call and the observation of the 'window' scenes become an immediate throwaway for solving the mystery thriller! The use of car chases and little Anna in peril to round up the story is a cheesy tactic of the scripting trade. Oh yes, there's plenty to put the audience on constant panic and on edge? but sadly, nothing really original in substance.Frankly, it's an eye-witnessing, but not a thought-provoking mystery thriller!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a word - AWESOME! Unique and imaginative filmography gives the viewer impressive insider views from various vantage points. Right from the opening, this is an intense and incredible movie, and easily rates as one of the best we've ever seen! What a treat, with great performances by Dennis Quaid, Forrest Whittaker and others and one of the best car chase scenes ever. A MUST SEE!! The plot was very well written - it kept us guessing until the exciting ending. One has to admire the character of Dennis Quaid's role, as he exhibited dedication, concern, commitment, moral fortitude and diligence in accomplishing his task of protecting his charge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It exists.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's say you are walking down some road, and you happen upon a rock. It isn't particularly noteworthy, it's just a stone laying there of no particular note. It isn't a bad rock or a good rock, in fact it is hardly worth contemplating at all. But there it is.Vantage Point is like that stone on the road. It isn't a good film or a bad film, but it is indeed a film.At its heart, Vantage Point is a caper flick-- a group of people plot a convoluted scheme and think of every angle in order to pull it off. But unlike The Italian Job or Ocean's Eleven, the antagonists concoct the scheme. And since they ARE the antagonists, they naturally NEARLY pull it off except for the quick thinking of a washed up secret service agent and the ineptitude and carelessness of a small child.It's the quintessential Hollywood bog-standard plot line.Films like this have done better and films like this have done worse. Like the stone on that road, there is nothing to strongly like or dislike about it.It just... exists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nauseating and Corny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I left the theater nauseated and disappointed. Too much camera movement and corny rewinds. The plot was decent but poorly told. Although the concept of "different viewpoints telling the same story" has been used successfully in the past, it actually detracted from this movie. Add in the obvious computer generated crowds (repeated over and over) along with repetitive ticking clocks, corny rewinding, and repetitive scenes and you have one tedious, nauseating waist of time and money. Save yourself from this one.Pros: decent story Cons: Poorly directed, too much camera movement and close ups, unrealistic dialogue, unfinished CG, tedious chase scenes, corny clock and rewind scenes, boring repetition of segments, etc. etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical American Rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Vantage Point to be one of those typical American action films that do nothing for you except reiterate the fact that in many American films, Americans come across as self obsessed, paranoid bullies who inevitably save the day ? or Mr President.The film was boring, the plot was boring, the fact that the film rewound every ten minutes or so is not only boring but downright irritating. The whole "war on terror" thing is boring and the fact that there are more and more of these dire "war on terror" films being released is boring. Give us something original for God's sake. The ending (I won't go too much into detail in case you want to actually sit through this tripe) made me want to throw up, but as the people sitting in front of me wouldn't hake taken too kindly to scraping my vomit off their necks, I decided it was best to suppress my initial need to puke. Looking back, I should have vomited all over the screen and Mr Presidents nice new blazer.I sound like I'm anti American but I'm really not. There are lots of American films that I love but they tend to be the ones that involve an element of thought and do not involve gung-ho American hype. If you like patriotic crap and predicable American propaganda then this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going back and forth reminded me of Groundhogs Day! It was super annoying to see the same events over and over, and then, they didn't even tell you WHY the terrorists were bombing and shooting! It was not worth the $14! It could have been a great movie had they gone into depth instead of jumping back to the beginning! You had no idea why they had the brother, why they were shooting the president, we needed more information on Dennis Quaids character, and Forrest Whitaker needed some character development!! Bad MOVIE!!! This movie could have been like The Usual Suspects in that it could have kept some secrets until the end... they showed a LOT on the previews... like the double president??? Why do they have a double?? We don't know!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Completely miserable. Don't go see this movie. Completely implausible. Portrays Spaniards as completely anti- U.S. (They aren't, I lived in the city this takes place in.) Is filmed in Mexico city, which doesn't even come close to resembling Spain. All the Spanish is spoken in Mexican- Spanish, not true to the actual dialect. Had several lines that left the audience I saw it with laughing hysterically...except they were meant to be serious lines. Also, don't even get me started with the rewinding of the vantage points...I thought a riot might break out in the theater around the fourth or fifth time. I won't even warrant its existence with any more commentary.</fullReview>

Its so boring, silly, cant get any worse,, 3.BG score is copied as-is from Bourne Identity series, car chases were attempted to be copied from the same movie, but poor guys even failed at mimicking the car chases from Bourne movies! 4.Story writer's creativity, imagination and knowledge of the scenario is visibly very limited. 4.Overall, a stupid silly movie, not worth a penny!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was OK but got very annoying........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the opportunity to see this tonight and it was good. The action scenes were intense. This is definitely original with the way they did it but after the 3rd time (you will see what I am talking about once you see it-I cant give it away here) it was starting to get a little annoying as I did see some people walk out the theater. Dennis Quaid did an awesome job, as usual, he alone makes this movie. I never suspected how it ended and the creativity and concept was genius but in my opinion need some adjustments. The director must be a big fan of movies like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and CLOVERFIELD (camera effects) as I was starting to get a big headache with camera shaking and bouncing around but finally stopped. It did seem like you were actually there right in the middle of it and experiencing what was going on. I can see this movie making a lot of $$ the first week but will fast fizzle out. Kudos to Forest Whitaker, awesome job.Great movie to see but I was a little disappointed in the final edited cut.</fullReview>
