		<shortDescription>And the Best Actor Oscar in 1998 went to....who???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Admittedly, I am a sucker for films about Hollywood. From "Sunset Boulevard" to "The Bad and the Beautiful" and even "The Carpetbaggers," watching a film about movies is always a pleasure, guilty or otherwise. "Gods and Monsters" can be added to that short list. The semi-fictionalized story of director James Whale's last days is a melancholy tale of an intelligent, creative mind that is beginning to fail and Whale's desperate fear of that mental failure. He sees in the handsome hulking form of his gardener an individual that reminds him of his most famous film creation, Frankenstein's monster, and he tries to reach out to him and offer the friendship that his film creation was denied. However, his mind is swimming in and out of fantasy, memory, and reality, and his gesture initially confuses the gardener, who sees it only as a sexual advance. In one of the Motion Picture Academy's most bewildering choices, the Best Actor Oscar for 1998 went to an Italian comic who has not been heard from since instead of to the brilliant Ian McKellan in what is arguably his finest film role as James Whale. Lynn Redgrave is funny and touching as his housekeeper, and Brendan Fraser, an adventurous actor who does not shy away from stretching his abilities, has yet to find a better role than that of Clayton Boone, the gardener. Beautifully written and directed by Bill Condon, the film is more than just an homage to old Hollywood. "Gods and Monsters" echoes some of the themes of "Sunset Boulevard" in its portrayal of a Hollywood veteran, who has been banished and forgotten by the industry and has retreated into a private world of his own making where he still directs the scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truth be told, it's not easy to write a film review as disconnected as I am from the underlying inspirations and principals of the movie in tow: Gods and Monsters. I knew little about James Whale and the Frankenstein franchise, possessed virtually zilch experience with Bill Condon (aside from the trivial baggage that his previous _and first_ feature film was the Direct-To-Oblivion sequel to the Scariest-Movie-Of-All-Time-When-I-Was-Fourteen, Candyman.), and unceremoniously avoided anything to do with Brendan Fraser. So, there's not much I can say about historical accuracy, era juxtapositions, or tour-de-force performances. All I know comes from the ninety-eight or so minutes I had with the film.Which were pretty splendid, to say the least. What more, I was pleased by how little the film seemed to hit me over the head. Not with a lengthy diatribe over the political progressions of societal acceptance of diverse sexual orientations, not with any sort of disgusted expose of Hollywood's miscreants. Instead, I found a minimal but simplistically acceptable plot moved along by wonderful acting, vivid portrayals of what it's really like, beneath the typical distractions, gimmicks, and veils, to be a human being. Ian McKellan astounded me. Fact or fiction, he wasn't necessarily James Whale, but a complicated, reserved, and often misunderstood director who found a glimmer of intrigue and desire for his new gardener, Clayton Boone, played impeccably by Brendan Fraser. From their initial meeting with Whale indulging in staring at Boone hard-driving an edger, I was struck by a remarkable sense of kinship between the two, which only got better as the film unfolded. And, with Hanna--the third vertice of the bizarre love triangle--the edgy buffer between the men, I felt incredibly comfortable just watching three very different people open up to each other and to me. The irony of the title, Gods and Monsters, is that whether someone or something is considered a 'God' or 'Monster' is largely due to perception...human perception. We invent our gods and our monsters daily, and they are usually people we know, love, hate, or admire. I spent a very good ninety-eight minutes, mostly from being in the company of those three fellow humans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Profound story of companionship and growth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**(SPOILERS within)**I read through all the comments and feel that a significant element of the movie was mostly overlooked -- the relationship that formed between Whale and Boone was not as one-sided as many have chosen to view it. While the movie appears to focus on James Whale's transformation into a human being at peace with his mortality, the more powerful dramatic transformation takes place with Clay Boone's character.Clayton Boone inadvertently provided James Whale a means for revisiting and perhaps coming to terms with his past. More importantly, Boone's unexpected pity in the face of Whale's intentionally uncomfortable verbal and physical sexual assaults in effect provided Whale with the strength to end his life on his terms. But what did Clayton Boone receive from this relationship? Boone is the son of an alcoholic father, emotionally confused and unable to connect with others (re: Frankenstein). His burgeoning friendship with Whale was a means for him to try yet again to understand and come to terms with his roiled emotions stemming from childhood. Boone failed to please his alcoholic tyrant Father (indeed, a Sisyphean task since children of alcoholics are doomed to fail in meeting the perceived emotional needs of the abusive parent), and thus Whale represents another Father figure for Boone, seemingly as impenetrable and emotionally unavailable as Boone's own father.This film is actually more about a young man growing up and coming to terms with himself. However the notion that all Boone needed was to confront his homosexual fears and overcome his rigid concept of manhood is off target. Boone is still trapped in adolescence because he is desperately trying to please his father; this makes the willing commitment to befriend Whale despite his sporadically abusive behavior all the more realistic. And the removing of the towel near the end is a watershed moment in which victim opens up once more to the abuser in a moment of complete vulnerability and trust. That his trust is betrayed (as it must have been so many times before by the alcoholic parent in his life) is heartbreaking, and yet both men recover and acknowledge friendship, platonic love and mutual respect in the aftermath. In the process of reliving his childhood torment through a Father-Son relationship with James Whale it is Clayton Boone who transforms himself and is fulfilled through Whale's friendship and shared wounds from an over demanding father. Whale's suicide at the end was not a reaction to failed lust for Boone -- far from it. His suicide was borne from the strength and clarity he derived from Boone's compassion, allowing Whale to face his mortality and willingly make peace with his past.I understand that many feel the ending scene with Boone stomping about in the rain like Frankenstein was unnecessary and over the top. But showing a contented Boone who had obviously progressed from one-dimensional relationships to become a caring father and husband himself was the most important story element in the movie. The James Whale character in the movie may have thought himself a monster, a sexual predator with few redeeming qualities, but before dying he made a connection with another wounded soul, enabling both to heal. Whale's own redemption may have been the A plot of the movie, but Clayton Boone learning to sort out his confusion and pain was the B plot and the exclamation point in the film's final scene. Watching him playfully 'Frankenstein-about' in the rain in recognition and celebration of the relationship that helped him achieve fulfillment was a celebratory moment, and not an unfortunate throw-in to appeal to typical Hollywood standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A reflection of Frankenstein</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A historical drama about famed director James Whale (Ian McKellen), Gods and Monsters finds Whale primarily in his last years, living relatively modestly in 1950s Hollywood. A heavy emphasis is placed on his homosexuality and his complex relationship with his young male gardener, Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser).Gods and Monsters is an unusual film in that although it's not very plot heavy, there is little feeling of a lack of substance. It's really a personality study, but a very deep, multifaceted look at Whale, Boone and to a lesser extent, Whale's domestic helper, Hanna (Lynn Redgrave). As such, the film largely hinges on its performances, which couldn't be better.Fraser is perhaps the most impressive, as the tenor of his role is very different than most of the material he's tackled over the years. He never fails to sell his nuanced character, who is something of a lower-class enigma with a clearly troubled past and a desire for a simpler future, but who hardly knows how to express or achieve what he desires. The description is almost a perfect reflection of Whale, as well, as we come to realize. Of course McKellen and Redgrave are good, too, but their roles are more along the lines of some of their past fine work.Echoing the parallel between Boone and Whale's histories and dispositions, Whale's life is shown as being deeply mired in the themes of his two Frankenstein films, even though he is shown as publicly wanting to play them down. Whale is something of a cross between Colin Clive's Dr. Frankenstein, Ernest Thesiger's campy Dr. Pretorius and Boris Karloff's sympathetic monster, enjoying the role of creator as much as the simple pleasures of food and a smoke, and ultimately desiring friendship rather than forlorn loneliness in his twilight years. Whale's loss of his creation on The Road Back (1937), from which he temporarily recovered his composure, and the perceived "monstrosity" of his sexual orientation and eccentricities began a slow process of alienation from the milieu he loved at one time. Like the Monster seeking emotional recompense, especially in the face of imminent destruction in the wake of a stroke, Whale attempts to latch on to whatever intimacy he can find from others, and ultimately expresses an embrace of death over living.Although the historicity of the film may be questionable on some accounts, it's important to remember that the film, although a historical drama, is still fiction, and many changes are by way of normal "literary license", designed to underscore more abstract points about Whale's life and character.Director Bill Condon nicely inserts select scenes from Whale's past, including his experience in World War I, which informed his films such as Journey's End (1930), and a wonderful recreation of Whale filming a scene from Bride of Frankenstein (1935). We also see an almost amusingly truncated version of the latter and some typical peanut gallery remarks showing how Whale's work was apt to be misunderstood. Carter Burwell's beautiful, understated music is also worth noting. My only small complaint about the film is that I would have like the music to appear more frequently than it did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sir Ian McKellen &amp; Lynn Redgrave Were Robbed of Oscars!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among the most intriguing characters I've seen is Hanna (Redgrave). I knew she was in the film, there she was in the opening seen &amp; I still kept looking for her! That's how terrific her characterization is of the Hungarian Catholic widowed maid to the flaming gay famed director, James Whale (Sir Ian McKellen).Is there 'any' character that Sir McKellen can't play to perfection today? In "God's &amp; Monster's", McKellen mastered Whale &amp; gave Fraser an acting lesson ::winking::. To watch the two real life friends, Lynn Redgrave &amp; Ian McKellen, play purrfect foils--Hanna praying for her beloved "Mr. Jimmy's" 'unspeakable' sinful soul because he's gay was hysterical. McKellen pretending to flirt with Fraser, the epitome of a t-totally straight guy that any gay guy could clock in a heartbeat, was also side-splitting. Hanna believing they were having a romantic relationship was just too much fun as she threw serving trays at them &amp; gave Whale scorned looks as if to kill whenever he'd have Fraser in for lunch or tea. These subtleties made the movie an absolute delight.Thus, while heavy drama was going on, there was a comedy line-in-cheek throughout the motion picture. Of course, the plot proves why "Mr. Jimmy" was provoking his hunk of a gardener (Fraser) . . . but I'm not telling. That's the best part of the picture.Whoever claims this movie is 'gay-bashing' doesn't know the meaning of it. The movie was about the director of "Frankenstein &amp; Bride of Frankenstein." He just so happened to be gay, &amp; thus, part of his life story as a gay man had to be featured in the film. Hanna playing a religious foil was right on time for the moment of the release of the film when the major church denominations are factionalizing over gays being equal in the churches! That's a great film--one that conveys a social struggle in the character of one great actor, Lynn Redgrave. She got the attitude of the church exactly right.Doing a queer critique of "God's &amp; Monsters," I rate it a 20 out of 10! This was not the silly, slapstick, "To Wong Foo," bizarre, "Stonewall," that was all out of context from the reality of the characters, or there ever so unreal (but cute), "Priscilla Queen of the Desert." This story is very true to life then &amp; now. It came out right on time, as well.Lynn Regrave delivered the performance of her lifetime! In my mind she won the Oscar. McKellen gave another of his stellar characterizations &amp; also won my Oscar. I also feel the picture should have been best picture of the year. Fortunately, many other notable awards were given that the blindered Film Academy was too dense to do itself. Redgrave was most robbed of her Oscar because she was anyone but herself! She wasn't even recognizable as Lynn Redgrave, for heaven's sake. So if anything or anyone was gay bashing, it was the Film Academy itself, for overlooking the Oscar winning performances of Redgrave &amp; McKellen &amp; the Best Picture of the Year.. . . &amp; I'm still watching it in late August 2007.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just gay vs. straight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally, I thought this would be a film of gay man versus straight man. It is. But much more than that, it is a film that speaks of human strengths and weaknesses, one that studies with quirky charm and quiet strength the scenario of man versus man.Without getting maudlin or preachy, "Gods and Monsters" goes about telling its story about ignorance, frailty, and unconditional love, the very themes that ran throughout most of James Whale's life and films.Bill Condon has created a poetic masterpiece, a wonderful answer to the question "Can't we all just get along?". Ian McKellen as James Whale is fascinating and absorbing, his facial expressions and body movements mesmerizing. He does not give a stereotypical "queen" performance. Rather, his James Whale is a dignified, yet tortured man. Lynn Redgrave is comical for the most part as Whale's maid, though she does lend a certain down to earth quality. It is Brendan Fraser, though, who steals this film. As Clay Boone, Fraser holds his own in McKellen's formidibal shadow. He does not provide a stereotypical performance either. Boone prooves to be as dignified and monstrous as Whale.The few problems I had with the film where two gimmicky scenes, one showing Boone's surrender to a request of Whale's that he pose "like a statue", the other a dream sequence that has Whale walking among his fallen comrades in the trenches of World War one, and one flashback on the set of "Bride of Frankenstein", a scene tainted by Arthur Dignam's awful portrayal of Ernest Thesiger.Eventually, "Gods and Monsters' proves two things: that we are all at once superhuman and sub-human, and that Hollywood can still show this in a beautiful way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange and fascinating film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gee, where should I begin? It's a character study -- but on what subject? About a man who came to gay awareness far too late to benefit from the gay lib movement? About an artist whose greatest achievements depended on extinguishing all connections between the personal and the political? All of the above and so much more!Personally, I'd give the Oscar to Brendan Fraser, who has a much more challenging role as the understated, naturalistic yard man, though Ian McKellan gives such a commanding performance that he's bound to play a prominent role at every award ceremony. If he's dissed because the love interest is gay, it's only the proof gay activists have long sought -- namely, that peronal respect is sexually conditioned.All in all a wonderful film for anyone who loves great acting and a director willing to push the envelope. It's a terrific look at the ways life has shaped all of our beliefs.Harry</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific! (To A Degree)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening credits to the (mostly) predictable climax, Bill Condon's film is a technical masterpiece and an excellent bit of arthouse fodder to boot.The title, which comes from James Whale's classic film Bride Of Frankenstein, refers to the gods and monsters living in our lives and vicariously in our close associates' lives.Condon has done a remarkable job editing in flashbacks, and the sketchy oblique, often contrasted shots pay great homage to Whale's early Universal pictures.The story is a simple one: James Whale (Ian MacKellan), famed director, has had a stroke and is slowly dying. He is a lonely man in need of companionship and inner peace. He tries to find this solace in Clay Boone (Brendan Fraser, in a rare serious role), his yardman. The blossoming relationship between the two is the plot focus of the film.Carter Burwell's score is wonderful as always, and Lynn Redgrave's role as Whale's housemaid is superbly put on. A great movie for any fans of the late Whale, or anyone looking for a true human drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gods Does Some Brilliant Soul Searching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gods and Monsters is an invigorating look into the spirit and the meaning to be found at the end of one's life. The film is based on the novel Father of Frankenstein by Christopher Bram and explores the final days of James Whale, the director of the original Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein movies. It was written and directed by Bill Condon (Candyman II: Farewell to the Flesh) and features a highly talented cast, led by Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, and Lynn Redgrave. Though not every scene is right on target, Gods is perhaps one of the most moving and emotionally complex films to hit the theatres in a long while. The story takes place in 1957 and is based on the relationship between the retired director and his gardener. Whale (McKellen), long forgotten by the Hollywood studios, has withdrawn to a secluded life of painting. However, following the latest in a series of disabling strokes, Whale becomes more and more reliant upon the care of his live-in maid Hannah, and more and more distraught at what seems to have been a lonely and meaningless life. Then he meets Clayton Boone (Fraser), the burly young gardener that Hannah has recently hired. Whale becomes fascinated with Boone, and right away asks to paint him. Boone, though somewhat flattered, is reluctant to accept the offer of the intimidatingly flamboyant Whale because he is unsure of the old man's motives. Boone does finally accept, however (if only to please the lonely old man), and what results between the two is of the most beautiful of friendships. McKellen and Fraser thrive during these scenes, in which their true acting talent shines through delightfully. The film is at its best here too, for it is here where we learn about the fears and inhibitions of the two characters. We learn that Boone and Whale, at opposite ends of life but equally as afraid of what lies ahead, really need each other. Whale needs someone to validate his existence and to bury the monsters of his past, and Boone needs someone to fill the void that was created by the lack of a father figure in his life. There are times, however, when Gods and Monsters can run a little slow. I particularly felt this way during Whale's dream sequences in which Fraser played Dr. Frankenstein and McKellen appears as the monster himself. These scenes serve to reinforce Whale's view of himself as a perverted monster, but they don't seem fit with the tone of the film and feel confused. For the most part, however, the imagery that Condon loads his film with is wholly positive. One such instance takes place in a scene between Boone and his former girlfriend, Betty (Lolita Davidovich). Betty, the older of the two, gets through telling Clayton that he is too immature and drives away, leaving him standing all alone on a hopscotch course in the middle of a playground. Boone, upset by what Betty has just told her, kicks a nearby can in disgust. The unmistakable impression that Condon conveys to the audience is that Boone, playing kick the can on top of a hopscotch course, is indeed a child. There is no doubt, however, that the acting is what makes Gods and Monster shine. Both McKellen (Actor) and Redgrave (Supporting Actress) were nominated for Oscars, and deservedly so. McKellen (Apt Pupil, Richard III), in pulling off beautifully such a complex role, once again proves that he is one of the top four or five actors around. And Redgrave, who won a Best Supporting Actress Golden Globe Award for this role, brings energy and wit to Hannah, whose wry humor and old-fashioned religious morality helps to pump life into Gods while at the same time further antagonizing the beleaguered Whale. It is refreshing to see her character written in this way, as all-too often this type of supporting character acts merely as a go-between and mediator for the two major characters. Brendan Fraser is another plus, too. Audiences who are used to seeing Fraser in one-dimensional roles for such movies as Blast from the Past and Encino Man may be pleasantly surprised as to the amount of depth he is able to bring to Clayton Boone. There are very few films that come out nowadays that have a combination of good acting, scriptwriting, and directing. Gods and Monsters is one of those few. It is certainly a film that is driven by the acting, but Condon's direction, as well as his script (which earned Condon a Best Screenplay Adaptation Oscar) provides a workable stage for the acting to take place. The result is one extraordinary film that any true movie-lover must see.</fullReview>

Brendon Fraser truly shows depth of character as the gardener.Not only is the cast top notch but the film is filled with fantastic imagery and subliminal qualities that take the viewer into the minds of the characters.From the beginning to the end the viewer is taken on a journey through the life of James Whale.

		<shortDescription>Remembrance Of Things Past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ian McKellen is superb as James Whale, the man behind the celluloid Frankenstein. Departing from that point, everything works. We're taken by the hand of this elderly celebrity in a world - and a town -that worships celebrity. The town also worships youth and box office grosses. For Whale, youth and box office grosses are way back in his distant pass. That's why, I imagine, the arrival of the gardener with Brendan Fraser's body, awakens in the old man some kind of spark. Their relationship is filled with a sort of emotional suspense that makes the entire movie, riveting. The story is told with a sort of personal melancholy that Bill Condon, the young writer/director, seems to understand fully. Compassion is in his eye and in his soul. The scene in which Ian McKellen remembers his swimming pool crowded with naked young men is one of the most beautifully reminders of how the aging heart remains alive within his memories. Very moving, very sad and very, very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not always easy to watch, but worth it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I resisted seeing this film at first, but agreed to see it at a second run house with a group of people. At the film's conclusion, I found that I liked it much more than any other person I went with. I found "Gods and Monsters" to be a thoughtful, intelligent, sensitive-yet-harsh study of later life and the reflections one experiences as death approaches. I was also very pleased to see the film draw Whale's Great War experiences into focus (although in less detail than I would have liked), and make them the central point to his life and career, and, as he is dying, his misery. The rather exquisitely torturous method of his wasting lends veracity to his ultimate actions. The film is also an excellent rumination on the vagaries of fame, artistic or professional control of one's work, and the value of work. Whale also bitterly recalls his youth and the feeling of being trapped in the English caste system in several scenes during a prior "family values" generation.The film is well-filmed but slow in spots, contains some cliches or scenes that are too "easy", but is highly rewarding, and is driven by excellent performances from Redgrave and McKellan and, to a lesser extent, Fraser. The film's final scene is great, too. I eagerly awaited the premiere of "The Thin Red Line", and having seen it, I would say that this film addresses the issues of individual humanity, social decay, and the horror of war much better. This film should be an Oscar sleeper. 8* out of 10*.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whale's films had PLOTS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My guess is that Bill Condon badly wanted to make a film about James Whale - and that's as far as he got. This isn't actually BAD, but I don't think I've ever seen a film so slight.It's not much of a biopic, since we see, roughly, two WEEKS of Whale's life. Apparently (although Condon tells us that some of the events are fictitious, and gives us no means of working out which ones), towards the end of his life Whale suffered from a kind of brain damage that meant he was plagued by vivid images, stray thoughts, and the like, which accounts for all the flashbacks. The film is a bit slow to tell us about the brain condition, though, which means that the flashbacks come across as a forced, ham-fisted device. The impression persists. Condon tries very hard indeed to draw links between Frankenstein's monster and Whale, the invisible man and Whale, between Whale's films and his experiences in the Great War. These links come across as forced, too.The thing is, nothing much happens in the two weeks of Whale's life we see - nothing to constitute a story. Yet Condon's attempts to drag in earlier events and make THEM part of the story don't work either. We see the filming of `Bride of Frankenstein'. What does THIS have to do with anything? Yes, Whale is having visions, but that's no reason why we should. Anyway, Whale himself is sick to death of being associated with Frankenstein, and would rather people thought of him as the director of `Show Boat'.The surprisingly good press this film has generated is almost entirely due to Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser. Normally I wouldn't watch a film for the performances alone, but this one is probably worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enduring friendship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Condon's "Gods and Monsters" is an excellent film. It is a tribute to those forgotten geniuses that were instrumental in shaping the movie industry in America. The film also shows how two people influenced one another in ways that no one could have guessed they could because of the two different backgrounds they came from. On second viewing, after having discovered "Gods and Monsters" at a film festival when it hadn't been released commercially, we can report the film is worth another viewing.Mr. Condon, the director, who adapted the Christopher Bram's book, made a great film about James Whale, an English man that came to America and became a film director during Hollywood's golden era. When we first meet Mr. Whale, he is old and living in retirement in his well kept house. He is assisted by Hanna, the maid who serves as his friend and companion, as well. Hanna knows all the secrets of "Mister Jimmy", as she calls him.James Whale, the director of the famous film "Frankenstein", and others, was a gay man living in a closeted society. Hollywood used him then, it conveniently forgot him. They all knew about his homosexuality, but everyone kept the status quo so typical of the era. Mr. Whale is constantly remembering his youth, his days during WWI, and his golden days when he entertained the cream of the gay society in Los Angeles.Into this picture enters Clayton, the young and handsome gardener. It's clear James likes him and wants to keep seeing him with the pretext he wants to sketch him. Clayton, is a straight man that becomes intrigued by the attentions Whale is paying him. Clayton has a lot of issues within him to resolve and he finds a reassuring friend in the older man.The three principals in the film are flawless. Ian McKellen is absolutely at his best in his portrayal of James Whale. One of the most felicitous scenes involves him taking Clayton to meet Princess Margaret, who is the attraction at a party given by George Cukor and which James Whale takes Clayton to meet the Princess, who clearly thinks she is talking to Cecil Beaton. The witty James Whale tells her that Clayton never met a real princess, but is in familiar terms with an old queen! Brendan Fraser does an excellent job with Clayton. Having seen him in the theater, we know he can act, and he rises to the occasion here playing opposite to one of the best actors of the English language. Lynn Redgrave's Hanna, is right on target. She can be a holy terror, but deep down she is a kind soul who is totally dedicated to Mr. Whale."Gods and Monsters" shows us that friendship can grow between an obviously gay man and a straight one because of their mutual respect for one another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gentle coda to life of celluloid monster maker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a certain amount of déj? vu about this movie as it covers some of the same ground as `Love and Death on Long Island', with John Hurt and Jason Priestley. Here we have Sir Ian McKellen as aging queer and Brendan Fraser as young male bimbo, but physical sexuality is hardly a possibility since the old boy is too infirm. Still, that doesn't stop him thinking about it, and of course there are all those old memories crowding in, helped by his recent stroke.The old fruit is someone quite famous in the history of film. He is James Whale, an English recruit to Hollywood in the 30s who directed at least one seminal masterpiece, `Frankenstein' and its sequel `Bride of Frankenstein' and several other memorable films including `Showboat' and `The Invisible Man'. Unusually, Whale was a production designer before turning to direction and his visual sensibility contributed greatly to the quality of his films. His directorial career in decline, he turned to painting in the 1940s. We see him in the last year of his life, 1957, when a ficticious Clay Boone (Fraser), working as a gardener, happens upon Whale, who is afflicted by ill-health but living in comfortable retirement in Beverley Hills and being looked after by his severe but caring Hungarian housekeeper (beautifully played by Lyn Redgrave).Old James invites Clay in to see his etchings, or rather to be sketched. Brendan, though ignorant of Whale's movies, somehow finds Whale fascinating and even develops some affection for the talkative old man. His own life is emotionally poverty-stricken and Whale seems to like him for more than just his body (which Clay as a confirmed heterosexual is not about to rent out). But for Whale it's really all too late ? Death is close by. Their friendship flowers briefly and then suddenly it's all over.James, a product of the English working class who became an officer, is dogged by horrific memories of the trenches of World War 1 ? the horror of his movies is positively pastoral by comparison. The flashbacks to Whale's film-making days of glory are interesting but serve to remind us that his time is well and truly past ? in the 20 years since he retired film-making has made huge strides and `Frankenstein' by 1957 is a museum piece.McKellen, a very great actor in the classic English tradition and himself gay, has little trouble playing Whale, but the real surprise is Brendan Fraser as Clay ? a quiet and well-judged performance. It's a low key movie perhaps mainly of interest to film buffs but it also addresses the issue of communication between the young and the old. Clay is enriched by his encounter with Whale, and Whale, for a brief time, is consoled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting Blend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, I was skeptical to see this film, since I do not agree with Mr. Barker's love for Bride of Frankenstein, and was afraid this movie was going to be an ass-kissing, wrapped in late 20th century homosexual undertones. The creators of this film did not travel that path. Instead, they treated the era Mr. Whale lived in as different as it was from today.Due mostly to Sir McKellan's performance, James Whale is hard to get a hold of as a person. The "interview-by-the-pool" scene sets the tone for his character at numerous levels. Though Sir McKellan is totally convincing as James Whale, bringing incredible depth and complexity, it's Brendan Fraser's portrayal that shocked me the most. He's so good, I can almost forgive him for The Mummy.I have read from others that they didn't think the homosexual tone is too apparent, and that's laughable. It is a major part of the story, especially in the first half. The relationship that builds between Fraser's character and McKellan's starts off as strange, but builds into a friendship with a father/son undertone (highlighted by the ending), shadowed by the creator/monster motif until the climax. You move from seeing Mr. Whale as this odd bird, to someone to hold with pity.Ms. Redgrave's performance is quite good, she seems to hit the period of the character's better than any of the others. The only performance I couldn't take was of the college kid who interviews McKellan's Whale in the beginning. The portrayal is way too 90's film geek. Totally out of step.Overall, this is a very deep film, with great character complexity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Is the Monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to sort out the same-sex personalities within this film. The only flamboyantly feminine male portrayal appears almost immediately, in the personality of the young man who interviews Whale, gushing over the early horror films, but wanting to know almost nothing about Whale the man; only slightly taken aback by Whale's demand that he remove one item of clothing in exchange for an answer to each question he asks. It seemed clear to me that Whale is just playing with him, and has no real interest in him as a partner. The same young man appears once more as "assistant to the social secretary" of George Cukor, whom Whale has identified as homosexual, who has arranged to have Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester at Cukor's party so that he can arrange a photo of Whale with "his two monsters"; a continuation of his earlier appearance. Whale is the prototype effete not flamboyant British arts based homosexual,in the manner of a Noel Coward or John Gielgud. He does not attempt to hide his same-sex preference from either the reporter or the young gardener whom he "courts". It interested me that when he joined the Marines, to please his father, he never saw combat, whereas Whale did during World War I, where, the film and the dialogue tell us, he first fell in love with a man, a fellow soldier, whose face, remarkable similar to the gardener's, appears periodically throughout the film. The third image of homosexuality appears in the characterization of Brendon Frasier as the gardener. Every man who has had a poor father relationship will often have deep rooted questions about his own masculinity. We see this in his being intermittently drawn toward, then repulsed by Whale's homosexuality. I have seen this ambivalence enacted on a number of occasions in male figuratively "fatherless" students, seeking a close relationship with an older man. In the midst of their developing relationship a brief scene informs us that he may have had relations with a waitress, who does not share his admiration for the original "Frankenstein"; and in an epilogue we see him as husband and father; however, walking in silhouette into the distance as did Karloff in the film. Does this imply that he is the monster? Some reviewers for IMDb have concluded that Whale is himself the monster? Who is the monster? Or is it no one individual in the film? At one point it is suggested that we are all monsters, both desiring friendship and destroying those to whom we reach out but who can never satisfy our inmost needs. A fascinating film that will be in my mind for many weeks or months, as I attempt to sort it all out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gods and MonstersThis human drama by talented director Bill Condon is an emotional masterpiece! Based from Christopher Bram's novel, Gods and Monsters depicts the last days of famed director James Whales and his flourishing relationship with his gardener Clayton Boone. Ian McKellen plays the ill-fated director haunted by painful memories of the past while Brendan Fraser, in a very serious role, is the man from which Whales finds peace.Director Bill Condon is especially remarkable with his use of flashbacks to delineate James Whales' haunting past and imageries from the late director's own creations. He makes his audiences feel the growing bond between Whales and Boone, and effectively touches his audiences during the director's tragic end. Though this episode is a predictable story, it makes us explore within ourselves the Gods and Monsters of our lives.I'm surprised that the Academy ignored Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser for their extremely fine performances. Ian McKellen gives an outstanding performance as the late director while Brendan Fraser fully shines in the film's climax. Lynn Redgrave is also commendable for her light performance as Hanna, the maid.This is superbly recommended for anyone looking for a film loaded with emotions</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would run out of adjectives if I tried to convey the magnificence of this film in written form. Every single aspect of it is simply superb; from more technical aspects like the photography, the editing, the music, to Bill Condon's wonderful screenplay and direction, and the extraordinary performances by all three leads, it's nothing short of astounding. If it was me giving out the Oscars this would have swept the board. This is one of the works of art that the 90s should be remembered for.The marvellous tale of how an old, homosexual, educated genius, in the twilight of his life, with a glorious past but also terrible ghosts, first tries to court but ultimately becomes a friend of a simple, young, good hearted man and opens his eyes and his mind with his stories and memories, becoming the turning point of his life, is gripping and moving beyond belief.Arthouse it may be, due to its reduced budget and complex content, but I can't understand how anyone could fail to be touched by this deeply human story, no matter his or her tastes. I recommend it to anyone who loves sublime cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You're A Dirty Old Man"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an annoying movie! Based on a novel, this film purports to be the story of James Whale, English film director, known for his Frankenstein movies of the 1930s. In real life, Whale may have been one whale of a nice person. But he's not portrayed here as such. Instead, as a white-haired old fuddy-duddy, fond of various liqueurs, and surrounded by stuffy old paintings, he comes across as self-centered, hoity-toity, and delusional, who likes to talk about himself and his past, in the presence of youthful male hunks.With mostly interior settings and gobs of dialogue, mostly about bygone days, "Gods And Monsters" conveys a starchy, moldy, pompous look and feel. The camera is mostly static. The film is talky and tedious, with Whale's utterances being spoken as profound words from on high.And there's nothing subtle about the characters or their motives, or the acting. In an early scene, a fully-dressed Whale (Ian McKellen) sits by the pool in the presence of a young male reporter, and insists that for each gossipy item revealed, the reporter must take off an item of clothing. "You're a dirty old man", says the reporter. Yes, and the film calls attention to Whale's lust over and over ... and over.The Clayton Boone character, Whale's preferred boy-toy, played with annoyingly he-man macho by Brendan Fraser, makes it crystal clear that he's absolutely, totally straight. And Lynn Redgrave tries to steal the show with her hammy, mannered portrayal of Whale's maid, Hanna.About as subtle as a sledgehammer, "Gods And Monsters" depicts Whale and his world in an all-or-nothing manner, as if the film were aimed at a mass audience that needs everything spelled out in black and white. Maybe that was the intent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie, with a good approach and acting performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason James Whale is a sort of a forgotten director. He made some great and well known classics in his career but yet he isn't as appreciate and much remembered as his fellow colleagues from the same period, such as lets say Tod Browning . I mean, if you now say the name James Whale, while anybody really know he was the director of the 1931 "Frankenstein" movie and its perhaps even better sequel "The Bride of Frankenstein"? It therefor is great that a biopic was made about this sort of forgotten and flamboyant, greatly talented director, who was among the best of his time.It's a great and wonderfully acted movie about James Whale, although I have the feeling that the movie is often more about James Whale's homosexuality than really about his life and career. Of course nothing wrong with a story like that but you can wonder if this at all time is the best approach for a biopic. The movie is also about Whale's final days, although it frequently uses flashbacks. The movie was also more about "Frankenstein" and "The Bride of Frankenstein" than any of Whale's other movies, though he obviously made many more and well known movies, in different genres. But I can understand why they did this. The Frankenstein movies get in this movie linked to Whale's real life and his ideas and views on things. It are of course also the two movies for which he will be always remembered. It's an approach that works great and effective for the movie but again you can wonder, if this is the best approach for a biopic. So perhaps as a biopic this movie isn't entirely effective even though the movie is definitely insightful about the James Whale characters but as a drama and character study this is simply just a great movie to watch.The entire approach to how the story is told is also great and original. It chooses to tell the story off Whale through the things he tells his gardener, who Whale befriends, though his intentions at first are obviously aimed toward something else. While befriending the gardener Whale looks back on his life and career and gives his own personal views and ideas of things, of course also mainly regarding homosexuality. Whale was one of the few openly gay high society and public persons of his time, which might very well have meant also the downfall of his career. The approach doesn't sound like a logical one or engaging one but it works out extremely well and is really effective in the movie. The script, by Bill Condon himself, also won an Oscar.The movie gets mostly carried by its actors. Ian McKellen was a great choice for the main lead and he gives one fine performance. It was a real big gamble to cast Bredan Fraser in a this sort of role, after appearing mostly in weak simple comedies before his role in this movie. Brendan Fraser never have been at his best in serious type of roles but he handles this role well. It also isn't a completely heavy and serious type of role, which also makes the movie easier and more pleasant to watch.The movie does have its slower moments, especially in the beginning of the movie but nevertheless Bill Condon shows he's a capable director by making every sequence work and keep things flowing well, despite the use of flashbacks, that normally also slow down movies. He also makes sure that the movie never becomes too heavy.The flashbacks and more dreamy like of sequences are all good looking and fit in with the rest of the movie. But perhaps with the exception of it's WW I moments. I don't know, for some reason WW I fighting sequences always look kind of cheap and fake, like they are shot in studios. Guess WW I is just a very hard war to capture and translate to the silver screen. Might also explain why there are actually so little movies regarding WW I.A greatly made and acted movie, that really deserves to be seen.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As perfect as it gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When reviewing any film (or anything else for that matter), it is important to keep in mind the distinction between quality and preference. Gods and Monsters may not be everyone's cup of tea, because they may not like the kind of film it is. For it's kind of film, Gods and Monsters comes as close to perfection as it is possible to get.First of all, what this film is not: It is not an Ian McKellen vehicle. If you want to see Ian McKellen pwn everyone else, choose Richard III or something else.It is not a gay or queer film. If you want to see a gay melodrama, in which innocent gays are oppressed, choose Torch Song Trilogy. If you want to see a gay comic book film, in which Mr. Gay defeats the oppressive forces of Dr. Hetero with his Gay Ray, choose something else. If you want gay erotica, find something yet instead.It is not a boffo Hollywood production. If you want a plot-driven movie, find something else.It is not a biography of James Whale, nor a tribute to his films.It is a serious character study of deep human emotion. It is about loneliness and death. It is about loss. It is about power. It is about people as they are. There are no heroes and no villains. There are only people. Deeply flawed, and deeply human.Given the kind of film it is, it is hard to find a flaw.The acting of the ensemble cast is superlative. Even minor characters and actors play into the ensemble perfectly. While it is tempting to respect Ian McKellen's acting, all the actors contribute equally well to the ensemble.The direction and sets are superb and amazing for such a small budget. The studio of James Whale (Ian McKellen) even contains original paintings by James Whale. The direction and cinematography flit between a modern, natural style and the direction of Whale, always appropriately. Every frame of every flashback and fantasy has a meaning. We see the body of Whale's old, probably chaste love, embedded in barbed wire, long before we know it is he.The score is haunting and provides a perfect accompaniment.The flashbacks to Whale's all-male parties may seem too much or not enough for some, yet this is part of the whole. It is part of a love, sometimes tender and poignant, sometimes brutal and full of betrayal, full of despair and death and lost eroticism, and full of healing and completion, that Whale ultimately shares with Boone.This is a story as much about Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser) as it is about Whale. At first, we see Boone as a collection of parts, not yet assembled. The final scene, much maligned here, completes his transformation as a whole person. Yet he plays the monster in the rain, as a tribute to the monster he might have become, fondly remembering the sometimes brutal friendship that made him whole.It should have won Best Picture. It is the best picture that I have seen in a long, long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences voters were on holiday when Gods and Monsters was realised. How else to explain the omission of Ian McKellen not getting an award for his role as the stricken director James Whale.Gods &amp; Monsters is a touchingly predictable story. But with direction and dialogue that puts it well above the norm. Whale, stricken by illness, has, in his eyes, become the monster. Haunted by the past, his only refuge from a bleak miserable future. Boone (Fraser) is the god, young, beautiful, seemingly indestructable. The film beautifully captures their relationship.Lynn Redgrave is excellent as Whale's maid Maria; it's a shame we don't see more of the talented Ms Redgrave. Fussy and attentive, she is obviously in love with Whale, by turns protecting and scolding her wayward employer.This is a small film, the type British directors excell at. Interweaving footage from Whale's Bride of Frankenstien, using Whale's own stunning imagery from that film, and coaxing tender performances from the cast, Condon creates a film full of gods &amp; monsters, which, as Whale rightly points out, are really inside us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gods and Monsters is in my opinion one of the cinema treats of the year if not one of the best of this decade. Disappointed by a visit to the Mod Squad, I visited ?Gods' to cleanse my palate. It was enchanting from it's sensitive commencement to an emotional conclusion. It boasts a resonant story which holds it's audience entranced. The script adaptation left no scene lacking significance. Characters are proficiently crafted. Equally substantial, Bill Condon's perceptive Direction was facile and lucid. A mixture of colour and black and white imagery was deftly handled as was the juxtaposition of time person and place in the remembered and imagined sequences. Ian McKellen was the consummate performer as fading Hollywood screen Director James Whale enfeebled by a succession of strokes. The film is further enhanced by a splendid Award winning portrayal of the loyal house maid Hannah by Lyn Redgrave. I was stunned by 'The Mummy's' and 'Blast from the Past's' Brendan Fraser as the hapless and perplexed yardman Clayton Boone who is befriended by James Whale. Who would have thought that such a sensitive and in touch performance could come from the Encino Man. Both McKellen and Fraser team up in some empowering closing scenes. Here one character sees mirrored in the other character's disposition his own fears and emotions. Every facet of Gods and Monsters is admirable. Miss this and you have neglected a very special motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple but effective character piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years have passed since James Whale was one of the top directors in Hollywood. Now he is lethargically living out his retirement with his maid, his memories and the odd bit of homosexual lechery. Into this world comes Clayton to cut the grass and tend the yard. Whale takes to the young man and pays him extra to sit for him to paint. While Clayton sits, Whale reminisces.Based on the book that semi-fictionalises the last few years of the life of James Whale, this film is largely conjecture with the exception that Whale's fate is not changed. The story of an old man being rejuvenated by a younger fan of sorts but not too dissimilar to Love &amp; Death on Long Island but it is made more interesting with the real life setting and the parallels with Whale's own films. It is not totally successful but it engages as a interesting story even if I wanted it to bring out the characters more than it did. It is driven by the characters, or rather, by the performances.McKellen is therefore the main drive shaft of the whole film. He brings out more pain and history with his looks than many of the words he says do. He pains Whale warts and all but still manages to keep the audience with him. Fraser may well have been chosen for the role because of his physical resemblance to the monster but he is also a talented actor. His character could have used more meat put on the bones but he still serves his purpose. The support cast are all pretty good but it is McKellen's film.Director Condon does well in blending the film with images and feelings from the Frankenstein films to paint Whale's supposed psyche. The film looks good in contrast to the bleak moments where we learn more about Whale, and the film generally looks well framed. Overall I did find the story a little too simple but still very effective; it is best seen as a character piece driven by McKellen in a great performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, loose biopic of old-school Hollywood homosexual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very difficult to see this film as anything other than Tinseltown-style agitprop for homosexuality and it stinks. I think it must be very difficult to construct a film principally about homosexuality in the vernacular of the mainstream audience: Philadelphia's about AIDS; Brokeback Mountain is a lovestory... I couldn't watch Gods and Monsters as a Norma Desmond-style paen to an old timer's Hollywood career as it seems transfixed on the carnal relationship between the two principals and the twist is a weak sop, far too little too late.McKellen should probably have known better but probably took on the project as a way of increasing the profile of homosexuality in the industry. That's all well and good but this isn't the vehicle for it, an insidious and confused medley of episodes which have more in common with a moody game of spin the bottle than a drama. Brendan Fraser tries hard. He is clearly an actor with more strings to his bow than the chisel-jawed hunk, but in this film he was cast primarily with the latter in mind. Lynn Redgrave is the only one to come out of the film carrying the dying embers of the flame of pathos. Bill Condon did better later with Kinsey, thank goodness for him. 2/10</fullReview>

Ian McKellen was fairly unknown at the time of this production but gives a very haunting performance and almost certainly rises above the written material while Brendan Fraser is an absolute revelation .

		<fullReview>Sometimes, great quality films don't take too much money to make and don't require a lot of star power. Here, we have Sir Ian McKellen CH KBE CBE in an Oscar nominated performance as the late great horror director, James Whale, who was also gay, artistic, and a genius. The film is based on a fictional novel about his life towards the end. In this film, James Whale is elderly and frail who encounters a handsome gardener, Clayton Boone (played wonderfully by Brendan Fraser in his best performance to date or since). Ian McKellen masters the role of the late director. They form an unlikely friendship. Clayton is oblivious to Whale's homosexuality or his film history at first. They become unlikely friends during their conversations. Whale knows his time is running out. The title comes from a line in his famous film, "Frankenstein." I don't care much for James Whale as a person. He seems too self-involved and cruel to his interviewer. The film also carries a Golden Globe winning performance from the late Lynn Redgrave OBE as his Hungarian Catholic housekeeper, Hanna. She is unforgettable in this role and her loses herself in developing her to be believable. Hanna is still devoted to Whale despite his sexual orientation. Still, the film is a character study. I loved the moment where Whale is reunited with Elsa Lancaster and Boris Karloff who was the Bride and Frankenstein at the Garden Party.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gods and Monsters" is the beautifully acted and somewhat fictionalized story of director James Whale (Ian McKellan) as he faces the end of his life. The openly gay Whale was the director of some of the great horror films: Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, The Invisible Man, and The Old Dark House, as well as the definitive Showboat, and one of my favorites, the bizarre Remember Last Night? (which no one in the movie does, by the way). After a debacle over the film The Road Back, his studio thrust him into directing B movies, and by 1941, his career was over. After that, Whale developed a love of painting and directed in theater, where he had started in the '20s.The film begins in 1957, the last year of Whale's life, after he has suffered a series of strokes. In the movie, his only companion is his housekeeper (Lynn Redgrave). (In real life, he was living with the much younger Pierre Foegel, whom he had met in France.) Faced with diminishing mental faculties and unwanted flashbacks from his past, Whale develops a sometimes uneasy friendship with his gardener, Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser). He asks Clayton to pose for him, and while Clayton does, Whale pours his heart out to him. Some of it is too much for the straight Clay, but over time, the two men bond. Each gets something from the other. But Whale will ultimately want something astounding from his new friend.This a complex film, well directed and written by Bill Condon, who adapted the novel The Father of Frankenstein by Christopher Bram. Whale attempts to create his own Frankenstein monster, in a sense, in Clay, and the stunning images near the end of the film which take place during Clay's dream sequence point this up. The film also demonstrates the loneliness and deterioration of old age, as well as the fear that goes along with it.The cast is nothing short of magnificent, with phenomenal performances by the three leads: McKellan, Fraser, and Redgrave. The late, always excellent David Dukes plays David Lewis, Whale's ex-lover and still friend; Jack Betts and Rosalind Ayres are well made up and vocally correct as Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester, respectively.Gods and Monsters is a sometimes dark, always thought-provoking film about old age, taking stock at the end of life, and the gods and monsters within each one of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must confess that I watched this film with some trepidation. I had some preconceived notions about what the film would be like, and fortunately I was completely wrong. This film is well-directed, well-acted, stylish, and has a lot of heart. Ian McKellan plays director James Whale with near perfection, and Brandon Fraser and Lynne Redgrave throw in two almost equally done performances. The life of James Whale was one of many different facets and this film pays homage to most of those facets rather than just focussing on one. The film was done in taste considering the content, and again I must applaud the acting which was top-notch. Yes, much of the film deals with Whales lifestyle and the fact that he was a homosexual, but much of the film also centers on Whale's work with the Universal pictures with some astounding flashbacks. There is a great, witty sense of humour pervading the whole film, as well as many horror genre allusions. A thoroughly enjoyable look into the life of one of the horror genre's greatest directors.</fullReview>

It was so uncomfortable watching James Whale, a man of great intellect and pride, facing the hand that the stroke and his developing dementia has dealt him. He is old and is grasping at the disappearing straws of his sexual identity. He's seen as a sinner by his patient, loyal, and harshly loving housekeeper. He is becoming pathetic and he knows it. He minimalizes his accomplishments and really sees only betrayal. Flattery gets no-one anywhere. A man of infinite genius grabs for a platonic sexual encounter. All this does for him is brings up the monsters within himself, memories of war and lost love. Brendan Fraser is quite good and Ian McKellen is superb. His elusive nature and "keep-em-guessing" responses to simple conversation would drive most of us crazy. But we would stay for the stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar worthy performances in a complex story line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ian McKellen, and Lynn Redgrave gave performances worthy of an Oscar, and Brendan Fraser gave one of the best performances of his career.The story takes place in the 1950s. McKellen plays a director called "James Whale", who was in vogue in the 1930s, but has since retired, and lives with his old German housekeeper. Hanna (Lynn Redgrave) hires Clayton, (Brendan Fraser), adrifter, to do lawn work, but McKellen has other things in mind for the good looking Fraser.What he has in mind though isn't the obvious thing though, although that's certainly on his mind. The relationship between them is far more complex than one of simple lust, and they each end up filling an important part in each other's lives, and find they are a lot more alike than different.This movie shows that when two people really care about each other, or need each other, that the lines we clearly think delineate us from each other, such as sexual orientation, just don't mean as much.This is a very well done movie that didn't fall into any of the traps and cliches most movies of this type fall into.Some people may find this movie hits too close to home, and be disturbed by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The monsters that haunt us every day!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone interested in producing a biography should pay heed to this film, simply because it manages to encompass everything we need to know about the subject by focusing on one small period in his life.Gods and Monsters looks at the final days in the life of director James Whale. This may not be the most notable time in his life, as we and the character are reminded constantly, yet it is the most telling. Years earlier, he directed the now classic Frankenstien films. While stunning achievements, they only serve as a reminder to him that his best years are well behind him.Gods and Monsters offers brief flashbacks to his glory days in Hollywood, and to his poverty stricken childhood, from where his monsters continue to haunt him. This is not, however, what the story is about. Whale, (played by Ian Maclellen) is now old and sick. He is a homosexual, forced to live his lifestyle in complete secrecy. His career in Hollywood is finished. After a colossal flop the studios no longer wanted him. He lives his final years in his mansion with his aging housekeeper and confidant, Hannah (played by Lynn Redgrave).Whale is smitten by the new gardener, Clay (Brendan Fraser). He flirts a few times, and soon they form a unique friendship. It is through this friendship that Whale is forced to face the monsters that continue to haunt him.I don't know much about the real James Whale, but that doesn't prevent me from applauding Ian Maclellan's brilliant performance. Like 'an old fruit out of season' the character is nasty and bitter. But Maclellan showcases the vulnerable side of this character, that of a frightened child and an emotionally scarred man.I almost didn't recognize Redgrave, playing the dowdy housekeeper, Hannah. She hides herself well in the role of a woman who strongly disapproves of her masters lifestyle, yet desperately wants to protect him from any harm.The film is best viewed on the small screen, in the comfort of one's own livingroom. The slow pace demands that you pay attention. Slight nuances in the character of Whale tell so much about the story that they cannot be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who is the God &amp; who is the monster?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, I cried so. Especially after the last scene. I thought about the movie and after it was over, I cried again. The last time a movie moved me so was probably "St. of Fort Washington" with Danny Glover &amp; Matt Dillon. My first impression was how lonely everyone was. The 3 main characters, Ian McKellan, Brendan Fraser, and Lynn Redgrave were all very lonely people. "Friend good. Alone, bad!" was one of the monsters lines. I have to say that after watching it the first time (and I hope to watch it many more,) I felt angry towards the James Whale character. He used Boone's character in order to incite him into wanting to try to kill him. When you think about it, he was perhaps planning it as early as when he said on their 1st or 2nd meeting how a big, Marine like him would no doubt break his neck if he laid a finger on him. Boone's character was making an act of love and sacrifice based on their friendship and his feelings of pity for this man when he offered himself for the final portrait in the "seduction" scene (as everyone seems to call it, but that's not really what it was to me.) All in all, one of the most thought provoking movies of the decade- all performances were great. Everyone seems surprised at the quality of Brendan Fraser's acting. Am I the only person that remembers him in "School Ties" and "The Scout"? I always knew he had it in him. And I remember Ian McKellan from "And the Band Played On" another movie in which he plays a factual based homosexual fighting for rights. His performance in that movie was but a promise of what he could do with a bigger and better role. This movie, and the others mentioned, are well worth seeing. In Whale's dreams, he fluctuates between being the monster and Boone being the "mad" scientist and yet calls him his monster in one of the last scenes. He tells him the only monsters are in here (pointing between his eyes) which is true. The monsters we make in our minds are the only real ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ian McKellen, Lynn Redgrave, and even Brendan Fraser (in the film's most difficult role) shine in this beautifully written drama. Bill Condon's direction, however, lacks imagination and aesthetic. It's entirely the actors who pull off this insightful and sad portrait of an ageing, ailing gay filmmaker who was "out" when everyone else in Hollywood was closeted. I'm betting there's an Oscar coming to Ian McKellen, and hope the Academy won't overlook Redgrave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astonishing Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gods and Monsters' is film-making at its best, depicting the final days of James Whale, a complex and complicated man, famous for directing the first two 'Frankenstein' films and the original movie version of 'Showboat.' Exquisite performances are given by the great Sir Ian McKellen as Whale, who executes every nuance, every witticism, every emotion, with a perfection that is little short of incredible; Lynn Redgrave as Hanna, Whale's formidable but devoted housekeeper; and Brendan Fraser, in a wonderfully humane acting turn as Clay Boone, Whale's hunky grounds keeper, who is unwittingly and inexorably drawn into Whale's ever-increasingly confused and confusing world. Whale's initial interest in Clay is sexually motivated, but the relationship becomes much more labyrinthine for both men than is originally bargained for. But the real 'stars' of this movie are the direction (Bill Condon, who also wrote the screenplay) and the cinematography, producing visuals that are often haunting and infinitely memorable, especially during the flashback sequences and in the metaphorical "monster" scenes. One of my favorites is a scene in which Fraser gazes at his own reflection in a sink filled with water--it's a breathtakingly fragile image, shivery and shimmering and achingly delicate, and it seems to suggest at something much deeper and far-reaching within Clay himself. This is a film filled with such images and subtext--dreamlike, poetic touches, superimposed within the structure of an otherwise 'conventional' story. Superb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Frankensteinian twists than are at first apparent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very impressed with "Gods and Monsters," in much the same way every other poster here was impressed; therefore, I won't rehash the various superb performances. Suffice to say that this complex and slightly deranged bio-drama follows with sympathy the final days in the life of director James Whale, frequently allowing us to delve into his waning memories of power, strength and sexuality. In the majority of IMDB postings on this film, I see much (perhaps too much) attention given to touchy-feely discussions of James Whale's blossoming friendship and his homosexual nostalgia. Of course, Mr. Whale's homosexuality is important to our understanding of this story, but it's not as central to the film as are the SUBTLE Frankensteinian twists. Having suffered debilitating strokes, Whale is planning for a mercifully quick death---anything is preferable to his slow and pathetic deterioration, but Whale is too fearful to commit suicide on his own. It's obvious that Whale INTENTIONALLY resurrects his homosexuality as a means of ending his own life. To that end, Mr. Whale attempts to befriend his macho gardener, KNOWING full well (or HOPING) that Clayton Boone will react violently to homosexual advances. In a Frankensteinian way, the old director is endeavoring to USE Boone like a homicidal monster, an instrument of Whale's own demise. When the time is right, Whale intends to push the forbidden button, releasing Boone's homophobic fury. But HOW could Whale know that Boone is more like a Frankenstein creature than he imagined? Buried deep within the powerful frame and homophobic rage is...COMPASSION. Without further spoiling the film, I just want to add that Brendan Fraser STUNNED me with the depth of his performance---I never took the guy seriously until "Gods and Monsters."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing Sir Ian McKellen at Stratford in England playing Romeo about 24 years ago. He was pretty dynamic then. As I watched Gods and Monsters, McKellen just bowled me over yet again. He certainly is a quite a classy actor and his 'out' status does nothing to harm his career which seems to go from strength to strength.The role of James Whale could be tailor made for him, and he seems to relish every moment. He draws the audience into understand the pain of Whale as he looks back on his life. A life that started with such humble beginnings, but went on to acquire a very privileged position in a world of sexual fantasy.However, the film meanders its way through his life and ends up observing his pitiful state, and to his surprise the arrival of a gorgeous hunk (Brendan Fraser). Fraser fits the role like a glove, the director skillfully handles the power of Fraser's physique and his sexual allure. He allows us to believe that he is this grass cutting country bumpkin, who is at first nervous of Whale. However, Boone (Fraser) warms to Whale and wants to hear all his stories. Whilst this is taking place, Whale pretends to draw Boone and the sexual chemistry is brilliant.The ultimate moment between the both characters is cleverly handled, where Boone tastefully bears all. However, it is all a ploy to get the hunk (Boone) to kill the monster (Whale). This is such a brilliant scene.Supporting all the above is Lynn Redgrave, who plays the housekeeper to Whale. She is superb in the role and makes the trio complete. Her casual remarks to Boone about Whale do not drive him away, but draw him further into the picture.Gods and Monsters deserves it's high ranking and a film that I would definitely recommend and watch time and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ian McKellen is the only reason to watch these imagined last few days of the film director James Whale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Whale (Ian McKellen), the Hollywood film director of the thirties who helmed such notable pictures as "Journey's End" and "Showboat," is retired now and looked after by a devoted but grumpy maid (Lynn Redgrave), who thinks it a shame that he'll burn in hell for being a homosexual.A bit of excitement arrives with an effeminate university student (Jack Plotnick) who is a gushing fan of Whale's work and wants to interview the man responsible for them. Whale soon learns the boy is not interested in his early stage career or movies like "Showboat." No, he only wants to hear about the ones Whale will be remembered for: his horror pictures.Whale has a disease that causes him to be excessively nostalgic, with scenes from his past (which we, the viewers, watch along with him) returning to him unbidden, including memories of his dirt-poor childhood and his time as a soldier in the Great War, where he met his now-lost love. Too many memories flood into his brain and give him a fit, which cuts the interview short.Whale discovers another young man will cause his mind to wander even more: the beefy gardener and ex-Marine (Brendan Frasier) who agrees to sit for him as Whale sketches his "architectural" head. The gardener is wary of Whale, especially when the maid confirms for him that her employer is a "bugger." Still, he continues to sit for him and even agrees to join him at George Cukor's party for Princess Margaret. Then one dark and stormy night, things come to a head between the gardener and the aged movie director.I don't get the point of all this. I wanted to see this film because I love "Bride of Frankenstein," but every time clips from that movie appeared, I wished the main movie would go away so "Bride" could keep playing. Universal Horror fans will find a few things to amuse them, including a flashback to Whale directing "Bride" (which includes only a fair recreation of the performances). I did like Whale's complaint that people are too earnest nowadays and don't understand that his classic monster movie is supposed to be funny.Bill Condon, directing his own screenplay based on a Christopher Bram novel, might have displayed a better sense of humor himself; or he would have realized that having Whale gaze wistfully at a vision of naked men swimming slow motion in a pool, accompanied by treacly music, is risible. There's an over earnest quality to the whole movie that seems ill-suited to the director of "Bride" and "The Invisible Man."The themes of life, death, illness and old age pervade these imagined last few days of Whale. What little force they have is due to Ian McKellen. He is the other reason I wanted to see the movie, and his rich, delicate performance didn't disappoint me.But everyone else? Whale mutters "comic maid" at his comic maid, and that sums up Lynn Redgrave's inexplicably Oscar-nominated performance. It's a theatrical performance, and it clashes with everyone else. Brendan Frasier doesn't seem to know what the hell he's doing, and I blame the writer-director. All the scenes with him and his girlfriend, and him and his bar buddies, are phony. He's marginally better with McKellen or Redgrave; it's clear Condon has a better feel for these scenes. But even then, Frasier never comes off like a real working-class guy, or a real guy of any kind, reacting to these situations. The final shot of Frasier in the rain, imitating Frankenstein's monster, might have seemed poignant; but Whale and the gardener never had a convincing friendship. They're two puzzle pieces thrown in a box and then shaken together for a couple of hours.A scene near the end is shocking. I won't give it away, except to say that if Whale had succeeded he would have sent someone to prison and ruined his life. Was Whale (the character, not the real man) so completely out of his mind that he was unaware of this? The film's sentimental tone undermines the scene and suggests that Condon himself was unaware of its implications.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That Has Meaning and Grace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the quiet movies that get to you. The simple ones that seem to be nothing then wind up slipping under your skin to make you wonder about life in general. Junk like "Pearl Harbor" and "XXX" vanish like cotton candy into your memory. Stories like "Gods and Monsters" make you contemplate what is truth and reality...and Oh, don't I prefer the latter to the former.On the surface, this film is about James Whale's attempts to manipulate Clay Boone into a new version of his most famous creation, the Hollywood version of the Frankenstein monster...a creature that destroyed its creator in the first Frankenstein movie. He knows the best way to achieve his goal is to gain the younger man's trust and friendship...and then betray them. All nice and simple and quietly played out. But underneath that quiet pond lie rip currents ready to seize you and drag you into new directions.Clay finds a surprising sense of worth in the older man's attentions...and Whale becomes a near father figure in their relationship...and their interaction winds up mirroring what happened between Clay and his real father. It also parallels another relationship of trust and understanding "Jimmy" had with another young man in the trenches of World War One. And ALSO parallels a director's relationships with his actors. And that is just one thread of the story to follow.There are the changes Clay goes through. He starts out hard and alone, like a junk yard dog, but grows to care for a man he would never have even paid attention to, once, even after that man brutally betrays him. And Whale...he comes to care so much for Clay, he puts his devious plan aside (until a spur of the moment change of heart) even though it may mean more deterioration in what is left of his life.What makes this movie so wonderful, to me, is how there is no one way to view it. You can see it as a character study of an old man nearing the end of his existence and wanting to end it; you can see it as a parable on friendship and manipulation; you can see it as a story about trust and the betrayal of that trust. The layers fit so neatly and seamlessly into each other, one becomes almost indistinguishable from the other.Needless to say, I love "Gods &amp; Monsters." I already had massive respect for Ian McKellen and Lynn Redgrave (they was robbed at the Oscars), but Brendan Fraser's low-key, almost brutally gentle performance was a revelation.Brendan, you kick it.This film is richly deserving of praise for every aspect of it -- from the writing and low-key directing to the perfect pitch music to the sense of time and place to the performances. A Michael Bay "Look At Me, I'm Directing And Making You Watch Me And Who Cares About The Story Or Characters" piece of crap this is not...and if that's what you like, you'll hate this film. But if you want something that has meaning and grace, then witness the beauty of "Gods And Monsters."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankly, I found the movie depressing. James Whale's life and career are whittled down to little more than the image of a witty-but-tortured queen. So what if Ian McKellen's performance is brilliant? That Whale's career could be reduced to his "gayness", and done in such a kitschy manner, struck me as cheap. And that "poignant" ending was a laughable piece of melodramatic cornball.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About Itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Another film about film. I love this stuff: self-reference is the stuff of real image manipulation. And nearly all films reference others anyway -- only related to reality through the filter of past images.Plus there is some very fine acting here -- acting of the simple kind where characters are defined and projected. McKellen is all over this -- Redgrave is a master -- but that's what we expect. My respect for Fraser as a serious actor has risen however.This film is episodic, coming in spurts. The director's perspective is also episodic: Sex; Film; Imagination; Longing; Perversion; Alternative Realities; Pathological Remembrances; Creating Lives that Lack Perfection; Dying Having Lived; Dying Having Not Lived.McKellen fills each level, but only one level at a time. That's the Shakespeare way, at least according to British dogma. So while the conception is highly intellectual, and the acting dear, it would have been better if we had a director and pivotal actor that understood how to do all this simultaneously. Like Penn and Nicholson in `The Pledge.' Like, dare I say, Whale himself.Here's a sign how weak the director is: each of the three leads uses a radically different acting style. Fraser is wholly physical and reactive; McKellen tries to control his environment with force; Redgrave plays not a character in this film, but a character in one of Whale's referenced films. These are all apt, but they are not coordinated.Strangely, the DVD extras detract from the higher dimensions of the film. I guess they figure it is easier to talk about a film by presenting a simple `explanation.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last days of Frankenstein director James Whale (Ian McKellen) are explored.The focus on homosexuality is perhaps what earned this film an Oscar, but it seems a bit forced. I have understood elsewhere that Whale was not someone who made his sexuality the issue, although here he seems to have it front and center. Is it fair to put him in a story where he seduces awkward and annoying young men? Why is this the plot? I really could have wanted any actor except Jack Plotnick. A dorky journalist who only wants to know about horror films is bad enough, but then to make him so ridiculous? How would such a person ever have even gotten to Whale's gate? Brendan Fraser does a surprisingly good job here. Not known for his acting chops, I am a bit surprised that he was cast. But he does alright.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot summary for Gods and Monsters states that it follows the last days of horror director James Whale, but it shouldn't be thought of as a biopic; it manages to avoid almost every pitfall suffered by most movies of that genre, except for one - predictability. The film is very predictable every step of the way, even if you know absolutely nothing about Whale's life or death, you can tell very early on exactly how it's going to end. It doesn't matter, though, because Gods and Monsters isn't about the story; it's an art-house piece and a character study, an exploration of a complex personality and, above all, a remarkably beautiful film.Like any biographical film, Gods and Monsters relies heavily on one powerful lead actor; Ian McKellen gives one of the best performances of his career as James Whale, with whom he clearly felt a certain bond. McKellen puts his whole into the film and creates real sympathy for Whale. Fantastic as he is, though, it's not a one man show; gorgeous editing that manages to organically combine flashbacks with loving references to Whale's own early films, creates a strong sense of atmosphere that Whale himself would have been proud of. Gods and Monsters is a natural companion piece to Ed Wood and Shadow of the Vampire, but it's by far the most brooding, subtle, thought-provoking one of the trio. As for supporting cast - Lynn Redgrave is fantastic in a small but memorable part as Whale's maid; Brendan Fraser, on the other hand, plays a very generic character, mostly there as an avatar for the viewer, and though his performance is decent, it's not by any means impressive, and he gets a little too much screen time, taking the film down just a notch from masterpiece status.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fantasy accounting of the last days of film Director , James Whale. Wonderful performances from all. James Whale(Ian McKellan) is suffering from a degenerative brain condition derived from a stroke. The culmination of life of ones life's work, touches everyone,and we see through the eyes of the former director, the experiences that build ones existence. For one who created the original Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein films, that is something.The film is sheer poetry, and the meaning of an individuals life is duly noted. Homosexuality is part of the background of James Whale, but it only adds to the film. His struggles of life, his successes, and his creative genius are explored in depth ,and with the friendship of the gardener Clayton Boone( Brendan Frazier), who delivers a solid performance, becomes his sounding board, in which we can share his feelings.Hanna the housekeeper (Lynn Redgrave) is more of a matron , who cares genuinely for Whale, and protects him from the outside world.If you are looking for a film with great depth and meaning, then look no further, for here you will find great meaning, of the human soul, and the complexities that form it. A Masterpiece for the Ages....Classic Film Making... 10 of 10... Collectors edition runs 1 hour and 46 minutes. Brilliant !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creation and Destruction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like most movies, so if I do like one, I'm amazed.This... there were so many things going on that were not as they seemed, but if you look at them in the light of "creation and destruction" they suddenly make sense. More than that.. understanding.Jimmy Whale's whole past was about the fight between creation (his art, his loves) and destruction (the war, his family). His most famous works revolved around these very themes (creation of the monster). Now, his brain was finally deserting him... no more creation was possible. It was time for destruction.Clay Boone was floundering between creation and destruction. He couldn't seem to do either. His attempts at creation (his girlfriend, becoming a marine to please his father) had failed, and as for destruction... he had too much compassion and hesitancy to accomplish any.Hanna, the housekeeper, also sees life in terms of creation and destruction. She considers herself married even though her husband died 20 years ago. The only destruction she sees is Hell. Her husband couldn't have gone there, so he's not gone. Jimmy has to go there, so already is destroyed. Yet she tries to save him as long as she can.Jimmy tries to recreate in Clay the motif that has accompanied him for so long: the Monster. He wants the Monster to destroy him, because he can't quite do it himself. He creates a relationship. Clay goes along because it's like a second chance at the father relationship he feels he failed already.When Clay drops his towel, and Jimmy says "So it's going to happen after all," I thought he meant a sexual relationship. But then I saw. Clay was baring himself as he has with his father, trying yet again to help and please. But Jimmy knows that he has his chance to use Clay's homophobia as suicide. He attempts it, and fails. Clay has too much compassion, or else is still too hesitant. The planned destruction fails, though for Clay, Jimmy's response mirrors what he's already received from his father. Destruction of worth.And yet, briefly, both men create again a friendship. Even after all of that, they can care.I don't know why Jimmy was able to kill himself after this. Maybe he thought Clay was his last chance at a "mercy killing" and it had failed. Maybe the knowledge that Clay wouldn't kill him despite his worst deliberate actions made him feel good/strong enough.Once I thought of "creation and destruction" I realized that the title says the same thing. Gods create, monsters destroy.The acting in this film is beautiful, and the themes are so deep that I hardly knew they were there. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...vs "Apt Pupil"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ian McKellen had never been part of my cinema vocabulary before 1998. That year, he played two very impressive - and dissimilar - roles. The first was the role of a Nazi fugitive in "Apt Pupil"; in that case, you fear his character, but at the same time can't help but admire him. The other role was in "Gods and Monsters" of homosexual movie director James Whale, the brains behind "Frankenstein" and "The Invisible Man (although the movie stresses "Frankenstein" and "The Bride of Frankenstein").Specifically, "GAM" focuses (apparently in a fictionalized way) on Whale's last few days alive, and his relationship with his gardener Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser). We might assume that since Whale was gay, he may have tried to directly come on to Boone. This doesn't happen in the movie, although there are scenes where it looks as though Whale is more than a little interested in Boone. How a certain scene tenses you up a little bit is a testament to the movie's strength."GAM" also goes so far as to show different periods of Whale's life. At one point, he is recounting to Boone his childhood in abject poverty in England, and we get to see it. Another scene shows his service in WWI; as Whale affirms, no war movie can ever accurately depict the battlefield ("They never got the smell."). There is also a memory of him directing "The Bride of Frankenstein". These all add to the movie's quality.Overall, this is certainly a movie that I recommend. McKellen affirms himself as one of this era's greatest actors, and Fraser shows that he can do a good role when he tries. Also starring are Lynn Redgrave as housekeeper Hannah, and Lolita Davidovich as Boone's wife Betty. Definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loving tribute to Frankenstein director James Whale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this twice now, at time of writing, and i've grown quite fond of it. First of all, this movie is an actor's dream - limited to a three million dollar budget, there are still some marvellous props and efficient special effects, but aside from these, this movie is 100% pure acting. It is fueled by two remarkable performances: just watch the doco on the disc, where you'll find pictures of the real James Whale, and then watch Ian McKellen's face in the movie, and you realise that he's virtually summoned the spirit of the eccentric, reclusive ex-Hollywood director of fun horror classics Frankenstein, Invisible Man, Old Dark House and Bride of Frankenstein. His partner in the duet of this movie is Brendan Fraser, who pays homage ever so subtly to Karloff's monster in his portrayal of gardener Clay Boone, who reminds Whale of his great creation and seems to evoke memories of the past in him.This movie did a wonderful thing for me: it left me with an appreciation for the character of Whale, and made me notice and appreciate his eccentric humour behind those horror movies.Haunting and beautiful (helped in large part by Being John Malkovich composer Carter Burwell giving a terrific haunting score), with the poetry and simplicity of a Bergman film, no less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Queer Take on "Gods and Monsters"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot (25 words or less): Ailing film director James Whale befriends his gardener, Clay, and the two men share a friendship that affects them both.Review: Acting (*****): Ian McKellen does a wonderful job portraying Whale. As an openly gay man, McKellen brings something to the role that another straight actor may not have found- a complete understanding of Whale's psyche. Brendan Fraser is so good as Clay because Clay is one of the most normal characters you will ever find in a film. You KNOW Clay. He is the neighbor, or co-worker, who you do not know real well, but know well enough. Clay is understandably upset at James' open discussions of homosexuality, due to the repression of the time. Lynn Redgrave is almost unrecognizable as James' housekeeper Hannah. She twists her body in such a way, she looked like I imagine a devoted but older Hungarian housekeeper would look. The remainder of the supporting cast is wonderful, David Dukes deserves a mention, but the make-up effects used to recreate the faces are perfect.Direction (*****): Bill Condon does a lovely job with his camera. He creates an ideal 1950's look with lush colors one moment, then cuts to a black and white fantasy dream sequence based on "Bride of Frankenstein" the next. When clips from the real "Bride of Frankenstein" are used, it is interesting to compare James Whale's vision with Bill Condon's vision.Screenplay (*****): Bill Condon wrote the screenplay based on Christopher Bram's novel "Father of Frankenstein." Condon uses humor well, saving the film from becoming a ponderous adaptation or a depressing suicide drama. Tossing James Whale's memories from film to war and a former love to childhood also tosses the viewer around time, and adds to the understanding of James' illness due to his debilitating strokes.Gay Content (****): There is a friendly kiss between McKellen and Dukes. One memorable scene has James remembering a pool party of the past, complete with nude men. James does make a desperate play for Clay, but his true motive is discovered. There are a few instances of verbal gay bashing.Conclusion: This film portrays James Whale in a sympathetic light. He is a victim of his strokes, but still enjoys the pursuit of young men. His friendship with Clay is real, and works despite Clay's clear discomfort with the gay subject. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

Brendan Fraser's performance as the gardener couldn't have been better. The way he formed his facial expressions to convey such intense emotion, led to such a refreshing, non-hollywood performance.

		<fullReview>** spoilers **I just read a bunch of the comments.I disagree that this movie bashes gays. For example; the idea that Whale's suicide at the end casts aspersions upon gayness (as necessarily life-disaffirming) is silly. Whale was a man. Men commit suicide. Whale, being a man, is not exempt from the fate of us all; that we will age and die, with no guarantees of elegance in the process, either in the nature of the aging process, or that our lives will bring to our declining years the glow of satisfaction. If anything, this movie does throw down a gauntlet, in the form of a cosmic puzzle: Where (precisely) did Mr. Whale "go wrong"? Did he? Or will the angelic tribunal grant him a crown of many jewels for his tragically profound humanity? People who saw the depiction of Whale's suicide in this movie as an exercise in gay-bashing must have missed the enormous complexity of his depicted character. Remember? He was suffering from post-stroke brain-dysfunction, producing heightened nostalgia which sharpened the sting of his professional misgivings and tortured him with forgotten war memories. He also suffered from general alienation, and a host of lesser demons. These are things that could even happen to a heterosexual; fancy that, wot?Whoever thought Lynn Redgrave's work was bad needs to get a sense of humor. It was the perfect foil, in so many ways, to the Whale role. Of course, this owed first and foremost to the writing, but between the script and our screens there were no weak links.How nice to see Fraser in his role. I'll never look at trailer trash (including me) in the same way.The modest-but-effective "dream" sequences were reminiscent of Bunuel's for their power; the power of the subconscious as a primal force.I'll mention the writing again. Some of the best screen writing I've ever seen.Interesting thesis; that one finds oneself in and through others, and that this spiritual symbiosis often has to swim upstream against mighty prejudicial torrents to spawn. This film delivered that message very effectively; and the...uh...complexity of Whale's sexual predilections (and Boone's, for that matter) were necessary to bring home the expectation-busting power of that symbiosis.It just occurred to me; I feel as though I'm seeing in Gods and Monsters the first truly, fully European-style movie made in the USA, ostensibly for stateside audiences. I saw "Chocolat" as an earlier example of this, but "Gods" has got it beat hands down on this count. I should think (and hope--to show those furriners that we yanks got taste and guts, too) "Gods" will get dubbed in a couple of languages and do very, very well abroad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is Horror?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember reading a column in Fangoria recently where someone wrote their list of the best horror films of the 90's and God and Monsters made that list. It took me by surprise. A puzzled look came over my face as I thought about it. That got me thinking. Maybe the idealism of horror movies have literally been changed. The general public holds this conception that horror movies are of a very close bunch. People screaming, dying, various instruments of death and a killer who murders for distressing reasons.No doubt about it there's a definite closed idea of what's makes a horror movie nowadays. I have to admit I'm very closed minded when it comes to thinking about what makes horror. I immediately think of the outward horror that is more easy to visualize and ultimately easier to identify. God and Monsters falls in the almost forgotten category of 'internal' horror. The terror and fright comes not from a psycho wielding a butcher knife, but internally from the protagonist.James Whale writer and director of the original Frankenstein and Bride Of Frankenstein movies is this film's protagonist played aptly by Ian McKellen. Seems he's not such a happy man. He lives in near isolation with his housekeeper for company and his old memories of film making, Hollywood and his deepest fears. Enter Brendan Fraser in an odd role for him as Whale's gardener slash caretaker. At first he just wants to do the work and get paid, but eventually they develop a relationship despite Whale's sexuality. Like most he's keenly interested in Whale's movie exploits and from there it's a roller-coaster ride for Whale who's life hits some low lows.I viewed it as a quiet, character-driven drama and I wasn't scared, I wasn't frightened. I did not see it as a horror movie and I still don't. I can see the underlining internal horror element is there, but to call a man falling apart horror might be too much to grasp for me. A quiet character driven story with light &amp; subtle performances by McKellen and Fraser is what I took away and I recommend you give it a chance. Horror or not.</fullReview>

Loosely based on the last days of the life of James Whale, a famed Hollywood director suffering terminal afflictions following a stroke. Whale(Ian McKellen), who directed Frankenstein, The Bride of Frankenstein, The Invisible Man, Showboat and others was shunned by Hollywood society when his homosexual secrets were brought out in the open.This movie shows Mr. Whale living as a recluse in his mansion with a faithful housemaid (Lynn Redgrave). Searching for companionship, Whale strikes up a rocky friendship with his gardener, Clay Boone(Brendan Fraser). After Boone's refusal to enter Whale's sexual life, the famed and once respected director commits suicide in his swimming pool.A frank and dead serious gaze upon human tragedy. The lead roles are extremely well acted. This is a must see of the '90s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gods and Monsters is a film which highlights what a great script can produce: a moving and involving picture with great performances from all concerned. However, this wouldnt have been possible without a well cast film, and Sir Ian McKellen was robbed of the Best Actor Oscar by Roberto Begnini.The story is a not so simple character piece. There is no goal to be achieved, unless you see James Whale(McKellen)'s desire to have his pain relieved in the ultimate form, as a goal. The "growing" relationship between Boone (never-better Brendan Fraser) and Whale is fascinating to watch, and the script provides many stylistic touches to both words and actions appearing on screen, allowing the relationship to unfold visually aswell as through words.This is the source of the film's high quality: the screenplay. Bill Condon has written and directed a script which won the Adapted Screenplay Oscar.Please see this film. Ian McKellen is a great actor, and should be seen at his peak here. Lynn Redgrave was nominated also for her role as the loving housekeeper, but is more of caricarture with her funny foreign accent.Critics have enjoyed this film as much as i have. please join the bandwagon, and you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent, if somewhat flawed, look at the life and work of James Whale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been fascinated by James Whale, if for no other reason than the fact that, in one career, he directed Frankenstein and The Invisible Man on one hand and also directed the 1936 version of Showboat and The Great Garrick! That kind of dichotomy is not something you see every day. All four films are at least very good and two are exceptional. Gods and Monsters is very much a film about people and Ian McKellen does his best work that I've seen to date. But Lynn Redgrave's performance is even better and probably her best ever. Make no mistake, this is McKellen's film. Aided by an excellent script and with most of the performances top-notch, McKellen delivers a fine portayal of Whale. Brenden Fraser is the one somewhat of a clinker here. He has his moments, but for the most part, he is barely adequate and at times isn't terribly believable. Had he done a better job, Gods and Monsters could have been in the Best Picture race instead of The Thin Red Line. But even at that, this is well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compelling, absorbing tale of horror, love, and degeneration.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was entranced by this film from the very beginning. As it develops, the film shows how Mr. Whales tried to express the horror he experienced in the trenches of war in the horror scenes he constructed on film. The stark, screaming realities run parallel, such as when we see the Frankenstein monster superimposed over No Man's Land, with the terrain and lightning effects showing disturbing similarities between war footage and the footage in Whales' horror films. Similarly macabre humor is pointed out between various monster scenes and the horrific humor we learn Whales has had to participate in while in the trenches. All the major actors in this film give excellent performances. Sometimes I was sympathetic to James Whale, and sometimes I loathed him, but I never grew tired of him. This was, I believe, at least as much a result of excellent direction as of McKellan's talent. Brendan Fraser's character (Clay) likewise presents as a person of complexities, whereas Clay could have easily been a one-dimensional pretty boy. Ultimately, I believe this film's strength lies in its director's sensibilities and interpretation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Over-Rated, Somewhat Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gods and Monsters" is a film which deals with the possible last days of famous Hollywood director James Whale (Ian McKellen in his Oscar-nominated role). Openly gay at a time when Hollywood just did not want to hear or know that, Whale's ability as a director was overlooked due to scandal and controversy. His empty final days are made full by a young gardener (Brendan Fraser) who befriends the elderly director and makes him realize that life is precious after all. Also along for the ride is Whale's Catholic housekeeper (Lynn Redgrave, in a strange Oscar-nominated performance) who is torn between her faith and her loyalty to her employer. Bill Condon's Oscar-winning screenplay is not very good at all. He is never sure where he wants to go with the film and this makes the movie somewhat confusing and irritating. His direction is nothing to write home about either. Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser both do good work, but they are unable to carry the film by themselves. They get no help from Lynn Redgrave who is awful in this film. Just like in "Shine", Redgrave is totally out-of-place. I do not know why this film has been honored the way it has. It was easily the most over-rated film of 1998. This movie is only above-average at best. Disappointing. 3.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie because I was told McKellan was good in it and that Frazer bared his bod.You can imagine my surprise when I found myself totally absorbed in the picture. What a wonderful story and what great performances. I sat and watched these actors take me into the old world of movies. A sort of "Sunset Boulevard" with different genders. There was the aging actor/director, the young gardner who visits and the loyal servant who takes care of him. There you have the same trio and almost the same period of time.I loved the homosexual underlying theme and Ian's playing his 'out of the closet' role to perfection. I loved Redgrave's simple, yet strong, performance as the caring servant who always watched out for him and his companions of the night. Fraser brought, not only the sexual contents, but a simplicity and somewhat dark shadowed side to the character. You wanted to see him give in to Whale. Yet, the way the final revealing was played, you couldn't have had a better way of demonstrating this. I applaud the director, Ian and Brendan for one of the screens most provocative moments in a movie. The way it was shot through a reflection in the window, while he slowly removed his clothes, was breathtaking. I can watch that scene over and over. In fact, I am going out to buy the video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding performance by Ian McKellen as one of the movies' great eccentrics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>McKellen has admitted that while he knew nothing about Whale when he was asked to play him in Bill Condon's movie, he did some checking and discovered their lives had many parallels. Whatever it took, he seems to have slipped into Whale's skin, giving a simply brilliant performance, the best by a male lead so far this year. If he's overlooked at Oscar time, it'll be nothing less than a damned shame. One of the remarkable things about this movie is that while Whale was gay (as is McKellen), this is not emphasized in the film any more than is the heterosexuality of Brendan Fraser's character. In short, this is not a "gay movie" but a movie about a man who was gay. Similarly, Whale's having been a movie director is simply part of his life -- and of his past, since he'd quit directing about 14 years before the time the movie is set -- so that this is not a movie about Hollywood per se, but about the end of the life of a man who lived and worked in Hollywood. It's really about a man trying to get ready to die, how he (sometimes unwillingly) re-examines his past life, with wistful melancholy, bravery and some sense of regret -- but he also knows he basically lived a good life. Whale may not have been a very pleasant person to know, but McKellen illuminates his soul -- at least as adapted from Christopher Bram's novel by Bill Condon -- and makes him endearing, infuriating and fascinating. The film is also &gt;beautifully&lt; photographed. Note: the story is mostly fictional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughtful biopic of a Hollywood horror director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rich, moving and insightful look into the later years in the life of an old, bitter man, this is probably miles better than any of the typical horror films released in 1998. It also happens to be Clive Barker's most interesting production for many a year. However, this isn't a horror film at all, more like a cross between a biography and an intense drama focusing on the relationship between two volatile men.The film is exceptionally made; it has a smooth, polished look to it and the characters are so well drawn and interesting that you never become tired of them, in spite of a slow pace. For the most part, we see insights into Whale's life, and the film becomes a character study of him, revealing his fears, his passions, and his forbidden desires. Despite being (on the outside) an unlikeable character, McKellen gives a subtle, impressive performance which makes us really feel and understand the director's state of mind. The ending is surprisingly poignant and tear-jerking, despite being a little predictable, and this film fully deserves the screenplay Oscar that it won.McKellen's understated performance is the key focus of the film, indeed the whole film as a success hinges upon it. I've never liked the actor much, but he plays Whale extremely well, covering all the mannerisms and tics and making them his own. Even his cultured voice is perfect for the character. Surprisingly enough, Brendan Fraser comes off well too. Fraser is usually known for his roles in comedy, playing likable but dumb characters. He plays the same type of person here, except seriously, and he brings a real touching mood to the film as he slowly accepts Whale as a friend and grows to love him as such. Lynn Redgrave enjoys herself in a small, comic relief role as a heavily-accented housemaid, and is frequently delightful.The strong homosexual theme is dealt with tastefully, never explicit and never in bad taste. There is one disturbing moment in the film, which involves a naked Fraser wearing a gas mask being assaulted by Whale, but this never veers over the boundaries of tastefulness - instead it's both frightening and sad. My only complaint (as a horror fan) would be that too much time is dwelt on THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN and not enough on Whale's other horror films - a few more clips wouldn't have gone amiss. New clips of behind the scenes on BRIDE are very well done, really capturing that Gothic feel, and frequently funny. The scenes of the garden party where Whale meets the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Princess Margaret, Elsa Lanchester, and Boris Karloff are also very good too, the actors and actresses being remarkably similar to their characters. On top of this there's a brilliant, moving and profound ending which uses a clip from BRIDE expertly. For fans of intelligent, slow-paced and thoughtful dramas, this is the one to go for.</fullReview>

He lives with his longterm housemaid Hanna (Lynn Redgrave) who finds his homosexuality morally wrong based on her religious convictions. He befriends his gardener Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser) who poses for his sketches. Clayton is a womanizing Korean War vet.There is something predatory about Ian McKellen's performance. He inhabits the dirty old man role without being completely disgusting. He gives a damaged vulnerability to his character. It is masterful work. I think Brendan Fraser is fine but I want more quiet anger from him. It starts right from the start when he hit the speed bag as he walks to the car. I just perceive Brendan having a bit of fun to hit the bag rather than him with anger issues. I think it's his persona. I keep thinking he is about to make a joke about something.</fullReview>

It has to be said that this isn't for everyone as it is slow of pace, and some prior knowledge and appreciation of James Whale is needed to truly get the best out of what this has to offer.

Yet the drama feels very boring because the scenes consists mainly of dialog of two roles, most of them in sitting position. Though there's a lot of effort in showing emotion play, there's only little else done on it besides the dialog and the facial expressions. All the little flashbacks feel a little non-congruent due to their short duration. Ian McKellen is surely at home with this character. Yet he did quite a nice job in portraying the gloom and despair of James Whale. Frasier as a young talent is a good balance in this movie considering McKellen's age. McKellen's age was not really covered well on the flashbacks, considering the lower advances in technology at the time of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>autumn respiration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>a film about refuge of past. and fear for future. a great role for Ian McKellen and an exercise for Brandan Fraser to escape from its usual characters circle. a movie who seduce. not only for story but for its melancholic atmosphere. it is like respiration of late autumn - soft, bitter, delicate. a film who not only present the final part of a life, a part of memories, need of the other and social ingratitude but the fall of a world. and that is great in this case. Lynn Redgrave, Ian McKellen, the precise delicacy and high inspiration of Bill Condon are pillars for a special confession of a way to discover the existence and transform it.sure, Brandan Fraser is not the best option for Clayton but his blank performance is useful in that puzzle. maybe, for define better the profound flavor of a world in its sense search.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McKellen Shows Us.......How Great He Is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1998 movie was made for only a little over 3 million dollars----which is peanuts by any standards..of to-day. Yet, it is pretty excellent. Ian McKellen is simply brilliant as retired movie director James Whale (Highly successful movie director of the 1930s) The choice of Brendan Fraser (Clayton Boone) as the gardener was a master stroke. Whale sees him as another of his "monsters !!"Whale and Boone become "friends", but we are robbed of any sexual tension between the two.... (Whale is a homo-sexual) but the Boone character is too rigidly fixed...in all his views. Actually, the Boone character never really existed...so I guess its academic. This is McKellen at his very best (why no Oscar .?) and its simply great to watch a master craftsman do his thing. Whale directed Frankenstien and The Bride of Frankenstien (and half a dozen other "hits") during his hey-day in the 1930s. In this hugely under-rated movie it is 1957 and Whales health is declining. A great insight into those old days, and a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Condon's likable tale, about two men of opposing ilks forming a bond amidst struggling health and heterosexual relations, is a studious and engaging drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gods and Monsters begins with a rough and grizzled looking man occupying a rather dingy little trailer out in what appears to be the middle of nowhere. His living conditions are small, enclosed and his general living area is messy with an array of scattered items such as beer bottles lying loosely around the place. The man's line of work is that of a manual labourer, somebody whom journeys from place to place in a truck which is tatty and unspectacular but does the job so as to get him there, enabling him to carry out agricultural work on the gardens of community higher-ups. He is in stark contrast to that of an elderly man with whom he shares the film's opening, a man whose garden it is the manual labourer eventually comes to maintain; a former film director approaching his seventies, the elderly man occupying living quarters that are elegant and lavish as he spends most of time in his study overlooking a swimming pool battling his serious ill-health, while the man himself is generally of a highly educated, highly informed and rather rich background. The two couldn't be any more different to one another, and yet Bill Condon's Gods and Monsters maturely and engrossingly brings the pair of them together as they appear to find common ground in the one thing they share: isolation which, you feel, leads on to further feelings of loneliness.The gardener is Brendan Fraser's Clayton Boone, a young but relatively introverted male living by himself whom often frequents a local bar for drinks and casual speak with friends and ex-girl friends. The space is the epitome of manliness, neon signs and bottles of beer and young barmaids occupying a space in which laid back attitudes and indulgence in laddish heterosexuality is the predominant order to proceedings. The film is effectively Boone's story to tell, the fact that a certain Sir Ian McKellen is playing a certain famous and once more true-to-life British film director named James Whale is beside the point; Whale often coming to merely compliment Boone's gradual arc of coming into contact with finer things of a cultural nature in life and gradually rejecting the above characteristics or ideals.And then there is Ian McKellen's Wale, one might even say that McKellen is perfect for the part, in that he is playing a cultured; British homosexual whom has reached somewhat of a peak in an audio/visual medium with a tale of how he got there as rich as it is. McKellen provides a stupendous performance detailing the ailing figure of the famous film director of various features Whale, and acts as a fascinating ingredient to a dramatic story about these two men which teeters between moving friendship and immense situ of discontent. Condon paces the bond either man share wonderfully, beginning with drinks on hot summer days in-between sessions of gardening and going on to cover passages of sketching Whale does of the man privately in his office.Condon has Whale act as more than mere supporting act to Boone's tale of how he once knew somebody famous; a telling moment comes during a very early exchange that Whale has with a young student interviewing him at his residence, the nervous and somewhat twitchy young man coming off as not particularly interested in what it is Whale has to say and is more inclined into veering the interview towards Whale's exploits as the man whom brought to life the first two Frankenstien films besides anything else. Such a sequence passes onto the audience similar sentiments which they may echo; how much about the man might an audience member watching know outside of the Frankenstien exploits? Condon's awareness of the item here rearing its head, McKellan's disparaging reaction at having to deal with such a response within the film going on to resemble Condon's own in relation to what it is people might commonly know about Whale, the film going on to explore his fading physical and mental health and somewhat deconstruct the man, not always in a particularly positive light, but a brave and confrontational one none-the-less.Following this, Whale's literal and verbal establishing to that of the young student interviewer of wanting to take everything from "the top" only echoes precisely what it is Condon does in the film in regards to Whale; a warts-and-all look at how somebody came to be how he was in the final stages of his life. As a character, an early visit to the doctor and the confirmation of serious illnesses which will affect him and deteriorate his overall health establishes the delicacy of the man and the severe health problems Whale has. Boone and Whale come to bond, the overhanging item throughout the film lingering in the form of Boone and his marital issues that he has with an ex-girlfriend in the form of that earlier bar's barmaid juxtaposing with the initial problems he has with his friendship with Whale which comes to form that of a steady going partnership.There is a telling moment much later on in their friendship, a moment that sees Boone admit to having lied about serving in the Marines in the recently concluded Korean War, itself an item Boone may well have used to infer 'manliness' or characteristics of an immensely heterosexual nature that being in the military and fighting in a war would be perceived as 'manly' and have those he's speaking to impressed by it. Here, none of it eventually comes to matter and speaking man to man with Whale eventually sees him shed those respective faux-attributes thus becoming a more rounded, more methodical man; feelings symptomatic with his reaction to the barfly's own reactions to one of Whale's films playing on their TV one evening following a deeper understanding of its creator. All of this and more combine resulting in a thoroughly competent, thoroughly mediative piece on the friendship two men forge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A respectable, if not lovable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gods and Monsters is one of a glut of critically acclaimed biopics that I always find to have fine acting, a well written script and a sure hand at the helm of director and yet it was all so... formal feeling and noble, going through the proper motions with the proper subtle yet predictable emotions and the subtle but predictable flashbacks. It's just not a compelling genre to me. Also, and I know others feel otherwise, but I felt that Whale's sexuality was treated very bluntly and rather tastelessly, it distracted from the more interesting aspects of the man. He was more that just a lonely old gay man. Not Mckellen's finest work, as some will tell you, but respectable, as is Redgrave. Fraser is the most adventurous of the three, giving the character deep and ugly flaws, and yet he's no stereotypical 'bigot' either. It's by no means a boring movie, it's just that I felt the movie was an exercise in excellent film-craft and cerebral, but lacking any emotional punch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but it had so much more potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gods and Monsters has an inspired premise. The life of James Whale is a tragic one. Whale was openly gay in a society where it could not be accepted. Whale here is a complex character and there could be no better casting than Ian McKellan. The role was tailor made for him, McKellan is very much like Whale in my opinion and it's not just because both men are homosexuals. They are both great artists.The premise of Gods and Monsters has a dying James Whale think about his life and legacy. He has a dark past full of grief and his stroke has left him in a state where these memories come to him every day. Whale has no purpose in his life, he's too old for a lover, he has no career, and the stroke has left him unable to draw. He contemplates committing suicide. Whale's life is given purpose when he meets his new gardener Clayton Boone. Boone is in awe of Whale because he is a former movie director. All though he is somewhat homophobic to Whales' sexuality the two strike a friendship. Whale however has plans of his own to exploit Boone to end his miserable life.Gods and Monsters is a great film but in the end I was somewhat disappointed by it. The whole picture seems too small. I would have liked to have seen a more grander scale to it. We don't see much of a world. Granted Whale was a recluse in his later years but I would have liked to have seen more.My biggest complaint though is that Whale's flashbacks only bring him back to the trenches and the production of Bride of Frankenstein. Why don't they bring him back to his other films or his relationship? I wanted to see his relationship. That would have made a more interesting movie. Did being gay in Hollywood cause in conflicts for him? They play around with his homosexuality but more in the form of him being a predator instead of having a real long lasting relationship.The acting is the best thing Gods and Monsters has going for it. McKellan gives another breath taking performance as the tragic Whale. Frasier delivers the best performance of his so-so career as Boone. The movie has great side characters as well, Jack Betts gives a fantastic Karloff impersonation. I would have liked to have seen more of Whales relationship there as well. Whale made an unorthodox choice with Karloff and they could have explored why that casting choice was made.Overall I enjoyed Gods and Monsters but it had more potential than what was shown on film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death is not the last thing one has to fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Whale, born in England in 1889, was a prominent director in the film industry of the thirties. He is best-known today for horror films such as "Frankenstein" and its sequel "Bride of Frankenstein", but was, during a relatively brief career, a prolific director who made numerous films in other genres. Like a number of other prominent Hollywood names of the period, he was gay; unlike many of them, he was quite open about his sexuality. The circumstances of his death, by drowning in his own swimming-pool, were for many years a mystery, but it is now known that he committed suicide. The film deals with the last few months of Whale's life in 1957, when he was in his late sixties and in poor health following a stroke. Despite his age and his health problems, however, Whale is still attracted to good-looking young men, especially his muscular gardener Clay (who is straight). In an earlier scene, Whale amuses himself by playing a game with a film student who comes to interview him; he will only answer his questions if the young man promises to remove one article of clothing for every question asked. The title "Gods and Monsters" is taken from a line in "Bride of Frankenstein", but can also have several other meanings in the context of the film. The original "god" was Frankenstein himself, because he created life and bestowed it on his monster; there is perhaps a parallel with Whale, who aspires to be a god, moulding Clay (a highly significant name) into his "monster", a new being in his own image. The term "monsters" can also refer to the internal demons which haunt Whale. He is tormented by his memories of his service during the First World War, particularly of the death of the young officer who became his lover. Clay, on the other hand, is haunted by the fact that he has not seen military service; he is from a traditional military family, and joined the Marines, but was discharged on medical grounds before he could fight in Korea. One thing the two have in common is that both had difficult relationships with their fathers. Ian McKellen (himself gay) is a highly talented actor, and he gives a fine performance here as a lonely, tortured old man. (It is noteworthy that he received an Oscar nomination for a film that was far removed from the traditional Hollywood mainstream). He is deeply unhappy for a number of reasons, of which his health is only one. His Hollywood career has long since petered out. (Whale's last completed film, "They Dare Not Love", was made in 1941, only eleven years after his first). He has separated from his long-term lover David Lewis. His only companion is his housekeeper Hanna, who remains loyal to him even though she disapproves deeply of his homosexuality. The film can perhaps be seen as a study in loneliness. Whale's interest in Clay arises partly out of geriatric lust, but also partly out of a desire for companionship. I cannot, however, really say that I enjoyed the film as a whole. Although Lynne Redgrave was good as Hanna, Brendan Foster seemed out of his depth and made Clay a rather unsympathetic, oafish figure. Some reviewers have seen the film as the story of how friendship and understanding can grow between two very different men, who differ in many ways, not merely in their sexual orientation, because of their mutual respect for one another. Some have gone so far as to see the two men as having a father-son relationship. That, however, is not an interpretation I can agree with, largely because of the scene near the end where Whale assaults Clay in an unsuccessful attempt to seduce him. Not much mutual understanding involved there, if Whale was under the illusion that Clay would welcome his advances. The late Alexander Walker, film critic of the London Evening Standard, said of "Gods and Monsters" that its posthumous libelling of Whale, without a shred of evidence for most of its fictions, proves that death is not the last thing one has to fear. Walker presumably took exception to the scenes with Clay and to the implication that Whale was, to the end of his life, a predatory seducer of young men. Indeed, the film goes so far as to imply (possibly inadvertently) that Whale's suicide was motivated by his frustrated love for Clay, whereas in reality it was probably motivated by his failing health. (He wrote in his suicide note ""The future is just old age and illness and pain"). Despite my admiration for McKellen's performance, I feel that there is some force in Walker's criticism. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, there was a war called World War One.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Whale was one of the pioneers of the Hollywood movie industry. The problem with this movie, however, is that it glosses over that important fact about Mr. Whale's life and, as is typical in Hollywood movies, concentrates instead on his personal life, which ends tragically. Of course, if one wants to watch a dramatic exposes about the life of a famous people, then this movie is perfect. But I was expecting, or at least hoping, for something more substantive, something more informative about what Mr. Whale accomplished, and not about the turmoil of his later life. That Mr. Whale was a POW in World War One, that he directed such classic movies as Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, The Invisible Man and Show Boat (perhaps the best musical ever made in Hollywood), is more than enough to encompass not only one but several movies. That he had his personal quirks and his share of emotional ups and downs is interesting and says something about the man, but for me, what is meaningful about Mr. Whale's life is what he accomplished. Despite these criticisms, I still rate this movie a 9 for these reasons: the subject the movie, Mr. Whale; the excellent acting, especially by Ian McKellen; the excellent cinematography; and Brendan Frasier's surprisingly strong performance in a dramatic role.Intense movie, about invisible wounds that never heal, about loss that is unspoken, about anger repressed, about personal growth, about reaching out for understanding, about rejection. James Whale was one of Hollywood's great directors, a true artist, certainly not a hack. This movie dramatizes the plight of the World War One veterans who fought in a war that is now all but forgotten. Mr. Whale survived, his companions did not. Enough said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intelligent and riveting movies like this don't come along that often. Several themes are woven together in this movie, but principally it's a story about growing old woven into a Hollywood biography.The actors are perfectly cast and give virtually flawless performances. The writing and directing are excellent.It needn't have been a gay story, but it is - and it is a good one. Gayness is a central issue in this film, as it was in the life of its subject. The two main characters are core archetypes of gay culture - the elderly sophisticate still looking for love and sex; the stud who trades in his youth and beauty for whatever it can get him. Gay desire for the unobtainable is also one of the movie's themes.The film is a biography that tells the specific story of a man who led an interesting life, Frankenstein director James Whale. But it's more than that. It looks with great sensitivity and artistry at a difficult theme that affects all of us - what it's like to grow old and approach death.Apparently, it won't be golden ponds and golden girls for all of us. After watching this movie, you can't help but wonder how old age will work out for you. Will you be alone? (Or even worse, with someone like Hanna?) Will you hunger for the youth, love and sex you once had? Will you be haunted by a lifetime of memories, both awful and glorious? Will you become frightened and depressed as your body slowly fails you?Gods and monsters. Worship and fear. Good and evil. This movie helps us to see that it's more complicated than that.In the end, it's a great story about growing old, but one that is amazingly woven into a Hollywood biography. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this one. I don't know how much of this movie is based on real events and how much is fiction, but fans of James Whale's horror classics 'Frankenstein' and 'Bride Of Frankenstein' are sure to be fascinated by this well constructed and well acted drama. James Whale is played by British stage legend Ian McKellen, and it's no surprise that he is close to perfect in the role. Brendan Fraser is certainly not the most obvious choice to co-star, but he is also very good. Fraser is best known for his work in lame comedies, but he shows some genuine talent here (also have a look at his work in the overlooked 'The Passion Of Darkly Noon'), and he and McKellen make an interesting duo. Lynn Redgrave takes a much broader approach as Whale's long suffering housekeeper Hanna, but I still really enjoyed her acting, which made quite a contrast to McKellen's subtler and more restrained performance. The supporting cast was interesting and included Lolita Davidovich and Kevin J. O'Connor, two blasts from the past. Neither have much on screen time, but it was good to see them involved in such a classy movie for a change. 'Gods And Monsters' is an excellent film, and I highly recommended it to anybody with more than a passing interest in James Whale, one of Hollywood's most underrated directors.</fullReview>

Having loved and lost I identified with the man when the "ghosts" from the past appeared. To me this was a love story. Also it is the story of a man grieving for his lost youth and possibly for life itself.

I always enjoy Fraser's comic roles, but this is the only "serious" role I've seen him in. He most certainly passes muster here.

		<fullReview>I REALLY liked this movie. All the main characters were portrayed with grace and the technical aspects were quite well done in my opinion. What a lot of other reviewers seem to be missing is the total irony in the perceptions of viewers compared with Whale's fame in the story. Seems that he was most famous for those sordid Frankenstein movies, when he had produced many other works that were so much better. The movie itself is famous for the gay theme, but there is so much more to it than that. Whale is such a complex character that is exposed in an elegant manner and totally believable (IMHO). Fraser portraying the macho gardener with compassion, as someone else put it, is also intricate for the times and quite credible. Anyway, my recommendation is to see it if you can.PS...This may not be Fraser's best performance. You might note that he has over 30 entries in the IMDB database and several for serious roles that might be better than this one. School Ties and The Passion of Darkly Noon come to mind (weird movie but I think he was good in it).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible minor spoilers:A very good picture by Bill Condon but was it a true account of Whale's last days in 1957? Adapted from a book, the film does a good job in telling us about James Whale, the director of a few Universal horror pictures in the 30s.The film tells us about his haunting past and his future, which is equally disturbing, a man who just wants to end everything, especially his life.Although some people feel that picture is stereotypical of Gays, I must disagree, in the 50s, this was just another taboo subject and is shown as such in the picture. James Whale cannot kill himself, therefore he uses his homosexuality against Clayton knowing of any consequences would be severe.The film's actors and actresses are brilliant, all giving perfect performances.The screenplay is good as well, but not great.The direction is nice, the full wide-screen frame is used to good effect. The photography is stunning at times, especially the WW1 scenes.Overall, I quite like the picture, but I'm not sure if it's truly fictional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this fictionalized movie biography, an aging James Whale, retired and living well in 1957 Hollywood, befriends his lawn man, and in the course of their short friendship uses him as a foil to work out some his life's issues. At first, Mr. Whale's overtures of friendship appear to be a pathetic pick-up attempt, but as the film progresses we discover that it is much more. Slow, almost plodding, this well-crafted and scripted film reveals parts of the director's past in flashback reminisces; from his unhappy childhood in England, the loss of his first love in the trenches of WWI Europe, and even some glimpses of his greatest directorial triumphs. Terrific acting and film-craft make this odd subject an interesting movie. Definitely worth a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is/was a lot of hype and buzz about this movie. As it turns out, it it just that-- hype and buzz. Just because a movie plays in art houses and is gay-themed doesn't automatically make it worthwhile or interesting.The problem with this movie basically boils down to the fact that the least interesting thing about James Whale (Ian McKlellan) was that he was gay... the most interesting thing about James Whale was the movies he created. Yet this movie spends no energy on James Whale the artist, and a lot of energy on James Whale the aging homosexual.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read comments posted by others, I'll be short and spare you the inevitable retelling of what everyone else has said. Instead, I'll point out that what surprised me was the adaptation of the book. A wonderful job was done, all the tones were captured masterfully from the novel and brought to the screen. McKellan and (especially) Fraser were magnificent, and showed depth truly from the book. (Redgrave was great as well, but I cannot compare her character to the one in the book, as it has been changed.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have viewed this film. I think Brendan Fraser played very well here. Apart from "With Honors", he finally make another serious film. The topic is sensitive. For some actors, they may easily spoil it. Thanks Ian, he leads in a sound way that made his opposite (i.e. Brendan) had a good sense of his part.However, Edmund Kay, the journalist and Hannah (Lynn), the maid were the most outstanding ones. The former appeared just for a few minutes but he would surely steal you to see him acting while Lynn knew the way she could truly show off her nervous thoughts.That's the most important point why I will strongly recommend you to see the film.Of course, the plot is wonderful, too. Don't you think so?-- Dave Duncan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's best about this film is, of course, Ian McKellen's brilliant acting. One of the best performances of the 90s, I must say. Absolutely awe-inspiring. I was also surprised that Brendan Fraser (who wasn't particularly good in the very silly film "The Mummy") actually can act. Of course, he wasn't nearly as brilliant as McKellen, but he did a fine job. The film itself was unlike any film I've ever seen, quite poetic and very interesting. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gods And Monsters is a rich, perceptive film full of delights. It above all recognises and revels in the complicated, shades of grey, people we all are. Some movies manage to winkle out the wrinkles, most don't even bother to try. Gods And Monsters slips bitter sweetly into the human condition. James Whale was a movie director who's greatest triumphs were Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein which were made in the mid 1930's. Skip to 1957. Whale (Ian McKellen) has had a stroke and has been beset with flashbacks to his younger years. War time horrors, his films and a love affair he had with another soldier in the trenches begins to intrude into his world. His monsters, particularly Frankenstein's monster played by Boris Karlof starts to inhabit his waking dreams. His loved one David, (a God?) stands watching. James Whale is close to death. He invites the gardener Clayton (Brendan Fraser) in and asks him to sit for a portrait. Clayton is homophobic, working class and at one of life's loose ends. Whale wants to talk and Clayton, fascinated by the stories, is prepared to listen. So two complex characters interact, heightened by terrific performances from McKellen and Fraser as well as from Academy Award nominated Lynn Redgrave as the disapproving, loving, long term housekeeper for Whaley.I'm sure that Judi Dench who won the gong over Lynn Redgrave agrees that Hanna rather than Dench's Queen Lizzie should have been honoured. The photography from Stephen M. Katz is outstanding as is the music from Carter Burwell. Lolita Davidovitch as Clayton's girlfriend and Jack Plotnick as the film buff are memorable. The direction and screenplay from Bill Condon is superb. We have here a thought provoking, thoroughly delightful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lately, I've been just watching all kinds of movies there are, from westerns to whatever, greats to epics. This movie I was not very eager to see, at the time I couldn't stand someone even mention Brendan Fraser, so, him being in it, you'd understand. However, I got around to renting it, after sometime and seeing how it was on the top 250 charts.Everything from the cinematography, to acting, to the feel of the movie is great, I felt connected to the characters, Ian McKellen gives a powerfull performance that is just, the best I've seen. Bredan is ok, performs like he should in the role. There is so much that is in it, the story, which gives emotion to the movie, it's all very real, and exciting. It centers around James Whale, of whom I didn't know a lot about, and his friendship with Clayton Boone, who is the yardman. I still don't know what is it about it, that I concider so great, but I just love it. And consider it one of my favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie with much anticipation. Being a fan of the three leads (Sir Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, Lynn Redgrave) didn't hurt, but was quite unnecessary to find this a wonderful film. If it were food, "scrumptious" comes to mind. From the sumptuous scenery, terrific writing, and elegant performances, this is the "little movie that could."A very human look into the life of a Hollywood icon, James Whale. The performances are so easy and subtle, you forget quickly that you aren't watching the actual people this movie is based on. To top it off, it holds up well upon repeated viewing.The very real subject matters are handled with such care and attention to detail, that the movie never slips into another tawdry tale of debauchery and excess.

Well-made film is uneven and occasionally inexplicable in some of its flashback and fantasy scenes, and McKellan is a little over-the-top. However, Fraser and Redgrave acquit themselves very nicely, and the film is ultimately a heartbreaking account of endless longing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful success with a risky proposition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good example of a movie made on a shoestring budget that really held together well. It's a great movie as is. While my personal taste is usually for a bit less symbolism in favor of more direct, observable behavior, Ian McKellan and Brendon Fraser are such masters of acting that they pull it off. Their characterizations were so full, natural, and rich, that the sometimes uneven artsiness didn't matter. I was able to buy the movie as a story, as a real experiential presence, rather than merely as some young director's "vision."I apologize for appearing to make fun of directors here, I'm really not. I am actually complementing Bill Condon on his job with "Gods and Monsters." It could have been so easy to see the director's hand in a movie like this. And I mean that in the very worst way. Instead, with this movie we see the story-- we actually see James Whale, and a realized version of the fictional Clayton Boone. And beyond just seeing them, we get a strong sense of their lives, the world they inhabited, perhaps even their vision. It seems that would be a really difficult task for any director. For 20-something Condon, his achievement of that kind of invisibility, and thereby decorum and integrity, is a special event.Lastly, producer Clive Barker is to be complemented. Not only was he instrumental in a wonderful movie getting made (in the face of considerable apathy and trepidation, the story goes), he also managed it all with a deft touch. For example, I'm a little "twitchy" in the face of certain kinds of "issue-y" or "lifestyle choice" movies, yet there is no trace of any advocacy nor "political correctness" anywhere in the film. That's great. How many of us would have exercised that kind of restraint, when it would have been relatively easy to flex one's financial muscles and insist that our own viewpoint or voice be represented? Barker showed enough personal character and confidence in the project to just support it, and not meddle with it. He trusted that the movie would turn out pure and whole, without his interference. So, "Yaay!" to all connected with this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whale Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This semi-fictionalized bio-pic of film director James Whale ("Frankenstein" "Bride of Frankenstein" "Showboat") is a superb realization thanks to the combined talents of star Ian McKellan as Whale, Director Condon, and original bookwriter Christopher Bram ("Father of Frankenstein"). Instead of the traditional route, Whale's life is seen in his sickly last days, flashbacks used only when dramatically right for the character. Bram (and the film) plop down fictional groundskeeper Clay Boone (hunky Brendan Fraser) to stir up Whale's homosexual desires, not to mention memories of the monster he and Karloff brought to life on screen. With stellar help from Lynn Redgrave as Whale's live-in domestic Hanna, the film is never less than captivating. Only briefly does the Boone/Monster transference get too much, as in the film's final confrontation between Fraser and McKellan. Congrats to Clive Barker, producer, for sheparding this fine film to completion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So just what makes this movie so good; such a pleasure to watch? Obviously, the acting was superb. I never heard of Ian McKellen before, but his award-winning performance was something to behold: very restrained, very subtle, yet very powerful. Brendan Fraser was a pleasant surprise. I enjoyed his natural, innocent style in "Encino Man" and "Blast from the Past", the only two films I've seen him in, but that sample did not demonstrate much range. In "Gods and Monsters" range was the operative. He demonstrated his easy innocence in the opening scenes. Later on, while posing for his portrait, Brandon does anger. In the end, when Whales goads Boone into nearly strangling him, Brandon does more anger, Brandon does frustration, Brandon does sadness. Didn't know he had it in him. As for Lynn Redgrave, I didn't even know it was her until the end credits. She was great. Fantastic Hungarian accent. These characters were totally believable.Another reason this was a great film: it didn't follow any typical Hollywood formula. Very unique. No big action sequence. No romance. OK, Whales and Boone have a certain intimacy; an emotional attachment. How many films have no romantic sub-plot? No femme fatale. No suspense. Still, it works. Go figure.The ending, though, falls flat through implausibility. Boone hits Whale in the face and nearly strangles him to death. The next morning he's found dead in his pool. They push the body back into the water so as not to draw suspicion to Boone. This is where they blew it. Cops, or at least coroners, tend to notice facial bruises and hand prints around corpse's necks. In the real world the suspicion would have fallen right back on Boone. But then again it's only a movie, so what the heck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What? Wow? Really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me agree with everyone that raved about the performances in this film. I watched the entire film only because of them. I was confused by the story. I did not see myself as naive before, but now question that assumption. This due to the fact that I found it hard to believe a straight male would keep coming back for more of what a homosexual Mr. Whale was dishing out to the "Boon" character in this film. Maybe it was Brendon's portrayal of this straight, gorgeous, butch Marine wannabe. Perhaps he was too mild, not desperate enough in a search for something inside himself that he could not reach. Not "something enough" to convince me that he could so casually and calmly go back to Whale time after time knowing the homosexual encounters he would experience when he did. Not something enough for me to understand why he was encouraging, and even daring Whale as it seemed to go a step further. There wasn't enough of Whale's character shared to have me believe that Boon was interested in propagating a fascinating friendship offered. Whale just looked like a sexually obsessed old man to me. I thought perhaps the Boon character was intended to be latent homosexual and therefore this homosexual relationship he maintained (for that's what it was) was stimulating. But the ending suggested otherwise. The film basically frustrated me because these superb performances, for me, were watered down by a confusing, and difficult to understand relationship. But I'm straight and admittedly not exposed to a good portion of that world. Definitely worth a look though. Thought provoking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant, powerful and touching film about the force of the human spirit!McKellen gives the interpretation of the century!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film maker James Whale was a brilliant director, responsible for memorable classics that until today live in our memories, like "Frankenstein". Talented, brilliant, experient, full of energy, complex and tormented, Whale finished his career in the most absolute decadence and ostracism, just remaining for him the memories of his glorious past, that embrace his poor and suffered childhood in England, his courageous participation in The First World War, the romance with a soldier who becomes the greatest love of his life and his success escalade in Hollywood. Ian McKellen, with certainty , is the only actor capable to interpret and to give life to such a complex and interesting character. Equally talented like Whale, McKellen interprets with will and enervating perfection the film director. His acting is, by far, the most visceral and genuine interpretation that Hollywood testified in the last years.I don't have doubts that the Oscar should have gone to Mckellens' hands, and not for Benigni, but this doesn't surprise me a lot, since i saw Robin Willians stealing Burt Reynolds' Oscar.Bill Condon, the director of the movie, should have been favored with a nomination for the statue, because as few film makers, he transposes with serenity and realism Whale's tragic life that, if sent to the hands of another director, could have been turned into an annoying and tearful film. Condon, instead, has the courage and the daring to film the show with realism and without concessions, and to build a work that explores all the topics in a clear and sincere way.Following his path, Condon made an acclaimed and wrongly not recognized by the Academy movie, in all its fullness. The scene in which Whale tries to seduce his gardener (interpreted by competent Brendan Fraser) is at the same time memorable and shocking, and we feel the pain and the blame that devoured Whale in his last years of life. At this particular moment, Mckellen demonstrates that Whale was just a human being, and not essentially a revolutionary god of the cinema. He demonstrates his weaknesses, sadness, deceptions and desires, and that turns "Gods and Monsters" into a beautiful film!watch this masterpiece, it deserves to be appreciated!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare portrayal of a homosexual man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite shocked at this film. I truly believe this is the first time I have ever seen a homosexual film character portrayed as a real human being--not a cross dresser, a sassy best friend, or a serial murderer. Here, Ian McKellen and Brendan Frasier portray two men who make a connection with each other that transcends the physical. Their friendship is pure and exists on a spiritual and emotional basis. This film, my friends, portrays what it is to be a "real man." The acting all around is excellent, and I am particularly glad Frasier was able to demonstrate the acting talent I knew he had all along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fictionalized last days of a Forgotten Hollywood Director!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ian McKellen gives an exceptional performance as forgotten film director James Whale in the SHOWTIME production "Gods &amp; Monsters". Whale, the eccentric auteur of the original "Frankenstein" and its sequel "Bride of Frankenstein" along with several other pictures from Universal Studio's Golden Age, committed suicide in the late 50's, having spent much of his last 20 years in quiet obscurity. This film fictionalizes his last days and speculates on the whys and wherefores of his demise.McKellen's Whale is now a far cry from the creative force that dominated the Universal lot in the early 30's. Alone, friendless (except for his dutiful housekeeper, played by Lynn Redgrave)&amp; suffering from the effects of a stroke and depression, he longs to end it all and concocts an elaborate scheme to incite his lawn man (Brendan Fraser) "to kill him" to put him out of his misery.The performances by all are uniformly excellent. Whale's openly gay lifestyle (perhaps the real reason for his near total ostracism from the Hollywood mainstream of the late 30's and 40's)is "prominently thrust" to the forefront throughout &amp; McKellen exploits the "Queenish" elements of his portrayal with perfection.While fictional,the plot line and character interaction remains believable and plausible; a sad &amp; lonely end to a life of great promise.An added bonus are the nostalgic flashbacks of Whale at his creative zenith, directing the now classic "Bride of Frankenstein". The parallels of the misbegotten monster's poor fortunes and those of Whale in his later life seem intertwined, as if Whale was predicting his own lonely future.Well made all around and well deserving of its many accolades and awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching love story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gods And Monsters is a very touching love story about a man who loved his craft and had passion for personal romance as well. The film is about director James Whale and his very lonely later years. Whale was a true artist in the very old days of Hollywood and a brillant director as well. Whale also had monsters that followed him in his past, and his monsters ultimately destroyed him. Whale meets a young landscaper and falls instantly in love, his passion isn't reciprocated,and he tries to make the most of the situation. Through all of this Whale eventually tells Clayton about his love for men and his love for one young man in particular in WWI. I can't believe the same director made the second Candyman film and then made this quite brillant little film about a man's passions and dreams. This is truly a very touching film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>G&amp;M is a compelling, rivative movie about one man and his past. Ian McKellen delivers an exceptional performance as James Whale. As the film moves on, we find ourselves caring about Whale and the events going on around him. He lead a hurtful life, betrayed by the film business, hurt by men, but he is also very vulnerable and giving to others. Lynn Redgrave is also wonderful as his devoted housemaid. Redgrave should have won the Oscar over Judi Dench, although McKellan comes in second behind Begnini's wonderful performance. I also love the title, it suggests good and evil, which is what the movie represents. I do highly recommend it, great performances all around, and good biography about a man and his demons.</fullReview>

I like films which give me another points of view different than other people. And this is greatTalking about the actors, I think Mckellen is amazing, but he always is amazing. In "Apt Pupil". in " Richard III" . In "Cold Comfort Farm" . Ms. Redgrave is very funny, too.But, Surprise, there's a good actor in Brendan Fraser. He grows in the last part of the movie. The naked present he gives to mckellen is a good moment of acting.This is a magic moment, for me, of course.I don't see " Darkly Noon", But I have to.If he chooses roles like this, He could be a great actor.

		<shortDescription>A homoerotic fantasy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gods and Monsters" (***) derives most of its dramatic tension from its depiction of the ambiguous, edgy and ultimately touching friendship between old-time director James Whale (Ian McKellan) and his hunky gardener (Brendan Fraser). This latter character is fictional and at first, the film would seem to be another variation on the old "I seduced a straight guy" homoerotic fantasy. There is that element in it, of course, but it turns out that these two totally opposite people do have things in common (e.g. both had harsh and demanding fathers). Finally, we discover that Whale has other plans entirely for his handsome new "monster." I'm not sure who the intended audience for this film might be outside of gays and old-movie buffs (the focus is a bit narrow), but for them it's hog heaven. McKellan is fine, naturally, but the big surprise is how good Fraser is. He manages to locate the vulnerable purity of heart under the macho, somewhat homophobic exterior of his character. He even manages to negotiate the most puzzling and surprising scene in the film: the one in which he disrobes and offers to be Whale's model even after he has found out that the old man is not really interested in sketching him. Judging from subsequent events, he's not really offering sex, but if not, is he just feeling sorry for him? I didn't think this particular character would go that far!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not only about gays in Hollywood, but about growing old. Whale grows old, not quite regretting his choices, but feverishly remembering them. He tries to forget his past, and remember it as well. It is a contradicting emotion, but it is true in most men. He tries to recapture his youth, especially through Fraser's character. It was an exceptional movie which does not insult the viewer and expects them to be mature. It views like a reading of a novel. I am sure if I see this again, and I will, that I will see more metaphors, and more hints and know how the movie was achieved better. This movie is a giant allegory with different metaphors inside of it.I liked the performances about, especially Brendan Fraser's. He is supposed to be the typical macho guy who is clunky, slow, and not altogether emotionally stable. McKellan is good, but a not sly enough or not enough in some other way, such as confidence or he is missing that certain "spark." Redgrave is great, and I liked her character, which was well developed for how short of a role she played. I think that all three deserve oscars. Although Mason deserved it more for "Affliction." Also Nick Nolte deserves it for the same movie.I give this movie a 9 because of everything. I take a point off because of ending, which needs to be better explained or better put. I like analyzing this film, but have not created a good explanation for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm sorry, Mr. Whale...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but your movie is not my teacup."Gods and Monsters" is, all told, a well-crafted story of the final days of "Frankenstein" director James Whale. Ian McKellan pokes fun at his own dignified British manner, instead of giving us another limp-wristed, lisping homosexual caricature. His lifestyle is his own private joke, using it to thumb his nose at The Establishment (a noble rebellion--in the 1950s, if you had a beard you were a Communist; if you didn't wear a hat outdoors you were wrong). Brendan Fraser is a stroke of casting genius (the shot of him through the screen door makes him look just like Frankenstein's monster--a great effect). And Lynn Redgrave, all costumes and heavy makeup, is a miracle.The embellishments and bits of satire are the best part of the film. The moment when Fraser the mad scientist, in a Frankenstein fantasy set piece, uses his teeth to tear stitch work in the head of the monster (McKellan), got a laugh from the audience. The "8 1/2"ish scene where McKellan imagines his own suicide (and chuckles at it) is wonderful.The photography is superb, as well, especially in those sequences.The film's folly, however, is in Bill Condon's script (the one that won the Academy Award). It searches for a glorious finale, one with emoting, catharsis, epiphany, maybe even a chariot race. "I won't be your . . . monster!" Fraser yells, in a hollow scene that will either make you cry or grimace in pain. Jason Priestly handled it better, in "Love and Death on Long Island", when he merely smiled sympathetically at an emotionally broken John Hurt, and left him sitting there (that film was superior to "Gods and Monsters", in its many parallels).Given filmmakers' history of injecting drama where there is little or none, I wonder if anything cinematic DID happen in James Whale's final days? If the history of movies (not the movies of history) has taught us anything, it is that any film has the potential to be great, regardless of the subject. Giving Condon the benefit of the doubt, saying for the sake of argument that his entire movie is completely accurate, the climactic scene is still too hackneyed and empty. It is a cheat, betraying a promising first half. The movie, as a whole, overcomes its weaknesses, and in the end it is a positive experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a positive review of "Gods and Monsters" Roger Ebert called it a film which works on a simple level. Interestingly, this couldn't be farther from my take on the film. I found it replete with layers of ideas, emotions and meanings. It wound together the desires and fears of Whale (Ian McKellen)with the doubts and loneliness of Boone (Brendan Fraser) to the point that only the true human elements matter: joy, togetherness, acceptance, love...not gender, sexual identity or sex itself. The obvious metaphor about Whale creating his own "Frankenstein" with Clayton is handled very well. When was the last time you saw a film deftly connect a man's passions with his vocation and emotion aspirations...into an understandable whole with his gay sexual orientation? Perhaps only here, only now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshing look at masculinity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can think of no other movie that so effectively addresses male stereotypes and sexual tension. Women throughout the ages have been subjected to the confining archetypes of Virgin and Whore, a concept that receives a good deal of attention and air play. Yet just as all women are artificially divided by this illusory gulf so too are men. Gods and Monsters picks up the underside of this equation for examination, exposing the infrequently discussed fact that men are, albeit to a lesser degree, constrained by ideals of achieving immortality (through fame, power, wealth) and being 'real' men purely by virtue of heterosexuality. In this respect, Gods and Monsters treads where few movies dare, providing a remarkably rare alternative to Hollywood's typical polarized vision of manhood. McKellan and Fraser turn in convincing performances as men falling somewhere in the gray area of the male gender continuum, cheated by a black and white world, but who come to find self-acceptance and healing through one another. Redgrave proves the perfect stodgy feminine foil for their drama. In illuminating the hard edges of masculine identity, the film deserves five stars for discovering a soft spot for all men's humanity and fraternity. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be my favorite film of 1998, which at first was The Truman Show. I can't even begin to describe it. Ian McKellan naturally gives a superb performance. I was most impressed by the slow realization of Whales' true motives concerning his friendship with gardener Clay Boone. The ending fifteen minutes would have to be the most memorable. Many responders have praised the final scene in which Clay lumbers out in the rain. I beg to differ. The final scene at the pool is much more powerful. We see that humans have the capacity to be both gods and monsters.I couldn't help but compare Ian McKellan's performance to that of Martin Landau in Tim Burton's Ed Wood. While coming from extensively different backgrounds they truly convey their alienation from showbusiness, which once hailed them as geniuses. Both actors portray their roles with dignity.Brendan Fraser also surprised me in his role. What a change from Encino Man! As the monster, it is his relationship with his employer that finally humanizes him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an interesting story that was both well crafted and well acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gods and Monsters is another movie I saw twice and although I thought it fantastic the first time I appreciated it even more the second. The film is full of symbolism as was intended in the original Frankenstein, flashbacks to childhood and World War I, and dreams, all of which mell into the compelling story of an old man (James Whale) facing a mental degeneration and physical demise. Ian McKellan is the my odds on favorite for best actor. His facial expressions and delivery of dialogue are incredible. The moods and emotions cover the entire human spectrum from sadness to anger to disgust to devilishness to joy to confusion and countless others. He delivers verbal barbs that pierce and sting one moment and has the person off balance with light heartedness and contrition the next. Ms. Redgrave was also excellent as Hannah, his protective "mother hen" housekeeper and should be rewarded by the Academy for best supporting actress. But this film although based on James Whale's life as an aging (dying) gay film director is as much a vehicle for Brendan Fraser who plays Whale's gardener but also his friend and confidant. Mr. Fraser shows himself to be an excellent actor in no way dwarfed by two great actors who deliver outstanding performances. Mr. Fraser has a stage presence and in some ways does more "acting" than the others. He begins as what would appear to be a rather shallow almost entirely physical presence to a mature man caring for someone very--and for the '50's--radically different from himself. This film is worth seeing---twice. Four stars!!!!</fullReview>

If it were up to me "Gods and Monsters" would make a clean sweep at the Oscars (with the exception of "Life is Beautiful" and "Babe: Pig in the City").This film, as most reading this probably know, is about James Whale(Ian McKellan), director of the original "Frankenstein", during the last week of his life and what could have been an extremely slow demise. During the course of the film a very delicate relationship is formed between Whale and his new lawnkeeper, Boone(Brendan Fraser). Both men are fragile but in very different ways. I won't go any further except to say that the symbolism and imagery that proceed throughout this film will shock you, amuse you, sadden you, and make you think like you've never thought before.My hats off to the director, Bill Condon. Mr. Condon, you are damn good. And that last shot, what can I say about that beautiful last shot? Before I forget, Lynn Redgrave WILL get the Oscar for her role as Hannah.

		<shortDescription>dehumanization and friendship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so much more than a biography. Nearly every scene and character descanted on the theme of how and why people dehumanize each other. The key allegory is that the god creates the noble monster whom he tries to manipulate. In context after context this theme repeats: the artistic child who demonizes his working-class father, the working-class father who thinks the artistic child is lazy, Clay's sexualization of the waitress who tries to befriend him, the brutish, alienated heterosexual encounter, the master who depersonalizes his housekeeper, the religious housekeeper who condemns gays. The living British soldiers dehumanize the corpse of a comrade to avoid contemplating the horror of his death. The heterosexual gardener stereotypes his gay employer. The gay employer perceives the gardener as a trophy. The princess of England distances herself from commoners, while commoners transform her into an icon. Wale must dehumanize Clay by making him wear a mask before he can provoke him to commit murder. The dehumanization theme is counterpointed by the theme of the restorative effects of friendship. "Friend good", the movie monster says. The depersonalized monsters become human in the capacity of friend: removing the towel, kissing the dead Wale, the final domestic scene and monster dance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's because I saw this after all of the critical raves and awards it received or was nominated before, but I didn't think it was a masterpiece. As Bram did in the original novel, FATHER OF FRANKENSTEIN, writer-director Condon engaged in camp a little too often, and when Fraser yells at McKellan to knock off the locker room talk, I was nodding in agreement. I also thought while some of the flashbacks were good, especially with the two of them on the battlefield near the end, Condon used them a little too much, and those times for flashy effect rather than to add to the story.Having said all that, I did like the movie. The relationship between the two was touching and not obvious. McKellan was good, best at conveying the sadness of someone tired of living. Fraser was a surprise; not only did he look the part(of a young Karloff, since he reminds McKellan of the monster), but he also acted better than I've seen him do in a while. I especially liked at the very end, when he dances around like the monster. Redgrave was good, though I wouldn't have given her the Golden Globe.</fullReview>

As such, I was pleasantly surprised by the focus of the movie on Whale and Boone as complete personas and not just sexual stereotypes. McKellan gives a wonderful performance as Whale, but Fraser's role is actually more demanding, and he fills it convincingly. Redgraves performance, while technically perfect, seems somewhat out of place as does the tacked on ending. I felt the scene of Whale slowly submerging into the water was much more powerful and fitting. Nonetheless, a great film and a touching statement on the impact of war, class, sexuality, and status in our society. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brendon Fraser, still sporting his buff "George of the Jungle" physique, proves he can actually act.This visually stunning film about the last days of director James Whale is not to be missed.Even though many people are listed in the cast it is a three person movie.This is Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, and Lynn Redgrave's movie -- everyone else is superfluous.There are many flashbacks but it is never confusing.Ms. Redgrave is amazing. It took me several scenes to recognize her as the oh-so-dowdy Hanna. When she kisses James Whale at the end of the movie it could be considered almost pornographic -- considering his state of health at the time -- but it comes across as the passion a woman has for a man she could never have.I pitied Boone's confusion -- just what does he have to prove; mostly to himself. But his love for Whale is real and tangible.He was Whale's monster -- complete to the flat-top haircut.And finally, McKellen as Whale. What a performance. He should be considered for an Academy Award.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film immensely. It was perfectly cast. I can't think of anyone else who could have delivered the machismo, ignorance, and untapped wisdom in Clay Boone better than Brendan Fraser. And who other than Ian McKellan could be James Whale with such dignified flamboyance? Vanessa Redgrave was over the top most of the time but she broke my heart at the end. More than anything else, I loved the directing. Bill Condon navigated the viewers through the twists in the story with such grace that it felt like a dance. Every time you thought a scene was going to sell itself short and become predictable, it took a sharp turn to the left or right and hit you with a truth that without the film would have been difficult to realize. Bill Condon managed to communicate many important messages without ever seeming preachy or predictable. This is definitely one of my favorites of 1998.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Streamlined but touching story of the life of an ageing gay film director and his friendship with his straight gardener.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suspect that this film over simplifies and takes great liberities with the life and work of James Whale. The real strength here lies in the acting of Ian McKellen. His characterization of Whale is at various points tender, frail, pathetic, manipulating, charming, and absent minded. Much of the film is taken with his attempts at luring Brendan Fraser's character into his life for lunch, conversation, and sitting as an artist's model. The film could have wallowed in cheap homoeroticism, but Fraser's character proves to be a kind person, willing to listen to and challenge the older man's excesses. These characters resonate long after the film is over, which is a tribute to the acting and the script by the novelist, Christopher Bram and director, Bill Condon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just after viewing the picture, I immediately thought it was good, not great. Then, later it lingers and you think more about it, and the film was astounding. James Whale created 2 movies where you felt sympathy for the monster, just like the other black-and-white classics, "Creature From the Black Lagoon", "The Wolf Man", "The Elephant Monster" (not really a monster). They are so alone, seeking friendship and love. This translates to the feelings of a gay man coping with isolation and loneliness during the 1950s. Ian McClellan and Lynn Redgrave were superb, as expected, but the biggest surprise was Brendan Fraser, who was magnificent in his role. This was a sensitive, beautifully written and photographed drama, lovingly created and directed.</fullReview>

It's about the last month in the life of Frankenstein director James Whale.Due to a stroke, Mr. Whale is suffering from flashbacks and can't sleep..but is strong enough to chase Brendan Fraser, his gardener, around. The two become interested in each other out of loneliness, and they develop a platonic relationship. I really enjoyed the acting, and think Mr. McKellan deserves to be at least nominated. Brendan Fraser also gives a good performance, although his motivations are a little nebulous. Ms. Redgrave does an impersonation of Cloris Leachman in "Young Frankenstein", but is otherwise enjoyable. I would recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply moving fantastic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, Ian McKellen is absolutely marvelous in this film. He is perhaps the least ashamedly gay character I have ever seen on screen. He radiates intelligence. Go Ian, we love you.Being affected by this film IS enhanced by being familiar with BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (which really is good, so it won't be a pain to watch). Near the very end, they watch the scene in which Frankenstein is taken in by a blind musician, whose blindness prevents him from being horrified. The old man is very lonely, and Frankenstein sits with him while he talks. (ironically, this is one of the only scenes taken from the novel Frankenstein, and it appears in the SECOND movie!)In the action of this movie, Frasier "Sits" for portraits by McKellen, and the two of them talk. McKellen's character is very lonely, and just the companionship of this man is one of the most generous offering he can give, and what makes this whole movie, particularly the final images, so moving. I was a basket case by the end.This movie has been compared to the recent, also excellent "Love and Death on Long Island," because both of them concern relationships between older gay man obsessed with young straight men, but there is a vital difference: where in "Love and Death" the focus is on the older man's transformation by his involvement with the younger man, in "Gods and Monsters" the main character arc is within the younger man, who is transformed by his generosity to McKellen, and his willingness to bravely stand up to his own fears about homosexuality and his own manhood. The film shows that it is the younger man's rigid ideas of manhood that keep him in the low-life rut he's in, and only when they relax through his (nonsexual) relationship with the older man, does he succeed in attaining the kind of life he wants.Another commentator has said that Whale's "gay-ness" is not important in this film, but I feel that it is very central, as this film is really, thematically, about ideas of manhood and creation, and where that places one as a gay man.I do have to say, though, it struck me how accustomed I've come to a piece of modern technology: twice in this film they wait for one of Whale's movies to be shown on TV. I do remember the days before VCR's, but during this movie I kept finding myself thinking: "Well why can't they just go rent it?"See it. Bring tissues.

One of those rare amazingly nuanced performances that refrains from telling you where he's headed. It's a director's job to make actors do their jobs, and here he shows he has had, from his first vision of the gardener, a clear idea of where he intends to lead the gullible young man. Pay close attention, because he doesn't waste a motion.At the same time, he shows us why James Whale was a first rate director in his own time.

		<shortDescription>One of the year's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Tom Hanks doesn't have the best actor Oscar sewed up, then Ian McKellen is a strong contender for his role in this excellent film. McKellen plays 30s Hollywood director James Whale, most famous for directing "Frankenstein" and "Bride of Frankenstein." Whale was openly gay, and the film imagines an episode at the end of his life in which he becomes obsessed with his handsome gardener and a strange friendship develops. Brendan Fraser nicely underplays the gardener, which serves as an effective counterpoint to McKellen's brilliant acting. Their scenes together are unpredictable and poignant. But this is far from just a tour-de-force or a two-character film. Hollywood in the 50s is well captured, especially in a sequence at a garden party at the home of George Cukor (Whale brings the gardener as his escort). There is also a hilarious early scene in which Whale is interviewed by a gushing young fan. The film's closing image is hard to forget. The one element in the film that I did not like was the performance of Lynn Redgrave as Whales's domineering housekeeper. This is over the edge acting that you will either hate or love (an Oscar nomination is not impossible). The character seems to have stepped out of one of Whales's horror movies (if you've seen "The Old Dark House," think of Rebecca Femm). But that is a minor reservation. The film is unusual and affecting, and definitely one of the year's best.</fullReview>

Initially I was okay with the main character being homosexual (Ian Maclellan), and that's fine. I have nothing against it.But in 15 to 20 minutes into Gods and Monsters, there is this pool scene with a bunch of swinging dingaling in slow motion. (and that was the point where I walked out of this movie....)Originally I gave this movie a 1, but since I walked out of it after twenty minutes, it wouldn't be fair for me to grade this movie based on my personal preferences. Let alone only watching this for 20 minutes.Watch it if this type of movie only appeals to you, or if you want to fast forward through these nude parts. But if your like me who's not to keen on watching dingaling, then avoid. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mackellan saves it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to love this film but only liked it. Bill Condon has a lot of good ideas but still tends to make juicy material dull. His KINSEY dragged in many spots and his earlier GODS AND MONSTERS leaves too much to be desired, considering the fascinating and previously unexplored subject matter: the final days of the gifted 1930s film director James Whale (FRANKENSTEIN, SHOW BOAT and THE INVISIBLE MAN, among others). My favorite scene is the poolside interview with the shallow and opportunistic fan magazine writer because it captures the essence of Whale and the state he found himself in by his mid-60s: a brilliant artist consigned to cultural obscurity, of interest only to film geeks, but with a naughty streak which enables him to get even when treated in a condescending manner.The plot, to the extent there is one, revolves around the homosexual Whale's attraction to a handsome young landscaper working on his property. Brendan Fraser as the object of desire just doesn't cut it. For one thing he doesn't act or talk like a fellow of that social station at that time in history; he seems more like a Gen X college jock. He is not helped by the clumsy script. Late in the film we are led to believe that the Frasier character bears a physical resemblance to the Frankenstein monster as embodied by Boris Karloff and that perhaps the attraction is explained by this resemblance. Episodes from Whale's past are presented awkwardly by direct explanation or uninspired flashbacks like a World War One trench scene which evokes nothing but the standard overused imagery. A few good lines of dialogue delivered by the expert Ian Mackellan as Whale would have worked far better. For a film that deals to some extent with the physical attraction of one person for another, there is no real eroticism even though opportunities abound.Lynn Redgrave as Whale's Hungarian maid supplies broad and welcome comic relief with her heavy accent, dowdy appearance, sourpuss facial expression and fractured English. The film belongs to Ian Mackellan as Whale. No matter how handicapped he is by Condon's script and direction he is believable as the human being he is portraying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GODS AND MONSTERS is not an easy film to describe, but essentially it's a character study of a man with fading memories of an illustrious past and his young gardener friend whom he takes into his confidence and with whom he secretly longs to recapture the gay alliances he had as a youth.He's James Whale, the director of FRANKENSTEIN and many other screen classics, who lived his life during the sub-culture of gay Hollywood that existed in the '20s and '30s, and he is played brilliantly by IAN McKELLEN. Equally fine is BRENDAN FRASER as the hunky gardener who gradually comes to understand the man he is working for.It's not an easy film to watch, with long dull stretches that seem to be superfluous to the main storyline, but as a character study it's fascinating to watch the story unfold with flashbacks into the man's blurry past. And, of course, it's worth watching for the performances alone. LYNN REDGRAVE has a marvelous turn as the man's housekeeper, physically plain and as unattractive as make-up could make her, but always showing the compassion behind her stern facade.The occasional glimpses of Whale's old films (and the reaction to them by various patrons of a noisy bar), are fun to behold. Authentic atmosphere and period flavor add to the charm of an interesting, well-told story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ian McKellan has a whale of a time (pardon the pun) in playing the British born director of Frankenstein in Bill Condon's film 'Gods and Monsters'. Driven from Hollywood by (homo-) sexual scandal, and afflicted by a series of strokes, McKellan depicts a man unable to come to terms with his own declining sexual appeal, defiantly outrageous in his behaviour but inwardly, deeply depressed. A nice touch is the decision to give Whale's servant (played by Lynn Redgrave) a rather monstrous demeanour herself. The plot, however, is surmisable from the opening scenes, centred on the emotional bond that grows between the apparently mismatched couple constituted by Whale and his gardener. Overall, this is a slight film, but still worth watching for McKellan's performance.</fullReview>

The only justification he could have for doing "Encino Man" over and over is that it would finance his participation in movies like these --so why doesn't he do more of them?I held my breath that it would veer towards homosexual/homophobic clichés but it sailed way beyond those shoals. I do disagree with the critics that the theme is the tragedy of keeping closeted in Hollywood, as discretion seemed to be the better part of valor anyway, but rather a reconciliation of all the parts of one's life, beyond sexual preference, personal, creative, family and cohort history (i.e. those in WWI were as affected generationally as Viet vets). This is definitely not for kids, not with all that talking, but it is an adult movie in the finest sense.(originally written 2/14/1999)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The God of all Monsters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Gods and Monsters' was originally adapted for the big screen from a book by author Christopher Bram 'Father of Frankenstein'. The story focuses on the life of one of the most famous British film directors of the 1930's, James Whale. In his prime, Whale directed many successful movies, but it's for his horror movies that most people remember him for, particularly the infamous 'Frankenstein' and 'Bride of Frankenstein' movies. However it's the circumstances of Whale's death which helped to secure him a place in the history books, and in the hearts and minds of many Whale is still one of the best British film directors of the twentieth century. In 1957 Whale's body was found in the swimming pool at his Hollywood mansion, it was the end of an era for the classic horror genre. Later it was concluded that he died of unnatural causes. The last few days of Whale's life still remain to this day a complete mystery, and it is these last few days that 'Gods and Monsters' tries to shed some light upon. It has since been ruled that Whale's death was suicide, but at the time there was much speculation as to whether this was the case and some suspected foul play. Even to this day there are probably people who remain unconvinced. But Whale had previously suffered a series of debilitating strokes, and though his motor abilities had been left 'relativity unimpaired' he became increasingly frustrated by his inability to concentrate, and by the memories of a past he had spent most of his life trying to outrun, which now continually overwhelmed him. In all senses of the word the movie is a drama. A dramatic, yet truly realistic and believable portrayal of what the last few days of Whale's life may have been, with some references to horror true to Whale's own style of film-making. Many of the characters including Clayton Boone - Whale's young and inexperienced gardener (portrayed by Brendan Fraser) and Hannah (Lynn Redgrave) the loyal and kind hearted house keeper, are totally fictional and as far as anybody knows never existed. However they were so expertly created by Christopher Bram in his novel that they still remain as real as Whale himself, making 'Gods and Monsters' a truly unforgettable experience, and an absolute must see for all avid movie goers. Starring award winning actor Sir Ian McKellen as James Whale 'Gods and Monsters' strives to and succeeds in creating a truly believable depiction of the last dying days of a man blest with a deliciously unique mind. The film respects it's moral duty towards it's audience. It certainly seems to understand the many questions it raises regarding the morality of the human race, as it strives to tell Whale's final story (just as Whale strove to tell that of 'Frankenstein') with sensitivity and understanding. The movie combines flashbacks to significant parts of Whale's younger life, with enactments of his troubled dreams and clips from Whale's own 'Bride of Frankenstein' succeeding in arousing a feeling of disorientation in the audience, providing a valuable insight into the mind of an ailing man at the crossroads of his life. The movie also offers many opportunities for in-depth film and character analysis for anybody interested in this field of media interpretation. I myself as an ex media studies student and aspiring actress was very impressed with the way Whale ans Clayton's friendship was handled even after Whale's death and found many of the scenes between McKellen and Fraser exceptionally moving. One particular scene that really caught my attention involves Clayton with his son towards the end of the film. This scene tells us a lot about how close Whale and Boone's friendship really was. Their relationship was a short one but one that had a heavy and long lasting impact on both of their lives. At times it was emotional and intense (however it becomes evident quite early on that there is no trace of sexual desire between the two of them) and towards the end they share a bond that will bridge the gap and shattered relations between them from beyond the grave!</fullReview>

Based loosely on real events.There is a famous scene in The Player where studio executives read the newspaper and from its news pages pull out likely stories for movies.This makes a true point, a good movie can be made from virtually anything. Even a story about a clapped out English director living in 50's Hollywood and finding less-and-less of his present life agrees with him.There are many films that survive totally on acting because precious little happens by way of drama. This is a perfect example. In Brendan Fraser (gardener Boone) and Ian Mckellen (director James Whale of Frankenstein fame) we have two people that can really act when the needs of their bank managers don't dictate matters. This might even be Fraser's best role yet.Norman Mailer was asked what he feared most and he said "obsolescence" and this is the theme of this movie. The director (Whale) has lived his life and seen the horror and pleasure.Sadly I wasn't really swept up in it all. I remained throughout just a passive observer on a life that contained more riches and success than most and had - as shown here - merely an unhappy final chapter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film Of 1998</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gods and Monsters", the 1998 classic from writer/director Bill Condon, centers around James Whale {McKellen}, a flamboyant homosexual who is somewhat of a recluse living in Hollywood. Whale, for those who don't know, is the director of such classic films as "Frankenstein" (1931) "The Invisible Man"(1933) and "The Bride of Frankenstein"(1935). The film is based on the final days of Whale's life, he suffers a stroke, and as his brain slowly deteriorates, he begins to have flashbacks of his childhood, his career, and his memories of World War I. Whale also befriends his gardener, Clayton Boone {Fraser} who, will play a major part in Whales last hours. Gods and Monsters is my favorite film of 1998, because it is very human, tragic and flawless. It makes my jaw drop every time I see it. Fantastic film from start to finish. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to know where to begin with the superlatives regarding 'Gods and Monsters'. James Whales' life in Hollywood is pretty well known to people who've lived and worked there and have an interest in film but he has been relegated to a paragraph or two in 'Hollywood Babylon' and other gay scandal sheets over the years and a good film about his life, or part of it, was long overdue. What I found so deeply moving about this wonderful film is how it captures the underlying sadness and tragedy of Hollywood. In my personal experience L.A. is the saddest city I've lived in, and I've lived in a quite a few. The public at large sees the success stories and only glimpses the dark underbelly of that savage industry, usually in the super market tabloids, when one of the "stars" goes haywire and makes a shambles of his or her life in public. What isn't often seen are the countless, very talented and promising "losers" in the roll of the dice which IS the Hollywood film industry.Where money is worshiped evil and doom gallops. James Whale got on the wrong side of Mammon and paid the price. He was fortunate to have amassed enough wealth to live comfortably into late middle age, many do not have that advantage and succumb to much worse, much sooner.The script for 'Gods and Monsters' is masterful, as is the music, ESPECIALLY the music by Carter Burwell. Yes, it's a "down" film but so hauntingly beautiful in concept and execution as to over-ride any quibbles the viewer has as he wipes the tears from his eyes.Brendan Fraser continues to astound me. There he is on screen with one of the great English theatrical masters, Ian McKellan, and he blithely holds his own and even goes beyond what one would have accepted in his performance of Boon, the hunky gardener who enters Whales' life at the end, at least in this film version. I don't know if there really was such a person in point of fact but the idea of it works brilliantly. It's hard to remember that this is George of the Jungle here, showing such a wide range of expression as to constantly surprise the viewer. I feared a few cringes, expecting McKellan to act rings around Fraser but that did not happen. Along with Lynn Redgrave in a rare and highly unusual role for her, the three of them make a powerful ensemble that is magnetic and unforgettable.The creepiness of the film isn't a result of Frankenstein or the Bride of Frankenstein, but more that blissful Southern California light and the "calme, luxe et volupté" veneer of the place. The only questionable aspect of the film is the sudden, violent thunderstorm that comes up for dramatic effect. I lived there for 12 years and it only rained like that once or twice, but they were indeed violent and disturbing storms, so credibility is not too strained in the film.A recurring thought has followed me around since I first saw this great little film and that is... "The sadness of swimming pools and their sinister palm trees." Sums up LA to my way of thinking and 'Gods and Monsters' may turn out to be a masterpiece simply because it has captured the louring presence of the place... the sunny side of hell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best of 1998</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's another 1990s movie that should've won Best Picture, but wasn't even nominated (see also "Donnie Brasco"). "Gods and Monsters" is a sentimental and speculative look at director James Whale's last days. Whale is superbly played by Ian McKellan, who got his indoctrination into the world of sci-fi, horror, and fantasy here; I wonder if he would've starred in the lesser vehicles "X-Men" and "Lord of the Rings" without first making this film and realizing that genre films can be a legitimate form of social commentary.It seems inconceivable that this film didn't get more recognition; perhaps it's too subtle and emotional to meet Hollywood's usual standards of obvious and shallow filmmaking. "Gods and Monsters" sensitively explores the issues of aging, loneliness, war, homosexuality, and even horror fandom. It's a low budget movie, but awash with light and color and wonderful period detail - so it's really quite easy on the eye. Beautiful in every respect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is McKellen's film as he plays James Whale, the great director of such classics as FRANKENSTEIN, THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN and THE INVINCIBLE MAN. The story picks up later in Mr. Whale's life when he becomes a washed up recluse. A cheeky old bugger who has a bone to pick with life and does so with a wicked sense of humour. A health scare deteriorates his mind as fragments of his childhood and the war in the trenches return to haunt him. To the rescue arrives the gardener, Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser), who metaphorically acts like a therapy lounge for Mr. Whales to relieve his traumas and hopefully get to lie on. A peculiar friendship builds between the two with great moments of dialogue in the script from director Bill Condon. Lynn Redgrave's performance as Mr. Whale's housekeeper is a show stealer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple yet powerful. Ian McKellen was amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gods and monsters" was such an effective experience that when I watched it last night and afterwards went to sleep I actually had a dream that was connected to this movie. Story is warm, quiet and simple yet extremely impressive and powerful. That best screenplay Oscar certainly found its way to the right address. Brendan Fraser was far from being bad but he was still probably a bit odd choice to play the part of Clayton Boone. 59 year old Sir Ian McKellen was phenomenal as Jimmy Whale, eccentric and aged gay-oriented movie director. He's a veteran actor who starred in his debut motion picture in the 60's but as far as I understand "Gods and monsters" was his real US breakthrough. Of course many heard about him for the first time when the first episode of "The Lord of the Rings" -trilogy entered theaters all over the planet. He was the heart and soul of "Gods and monsters", McKellen's stylish and devoted performance as Whale was simply breathtaking and certainly one of the greatest and the most memorable achievements of his career (alongside with Gandalf, of course). It may be that "Gods and monsters" is based on a facts very loosely but nevertheless everyone who has seen legendary 30's horror classics "Frankenstein" and "Bride of Frankenstein" should watch this film too and take a touching and fascinating look at the life of retired James Whale. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The DVD transfer of "Gods and Monsters" is a joy to behold. With its sharp images and bold colors, it wonderfully captures the screen original. The film is remarkable; the more one views it, the more one's attention is captured, as more and more discoveries are made. The fine work of Ian McKlellen and Lynn Redgrave have been rightfully lauded elsewhere. Two other pieces of work in particular continue to emerge as particularly fine: the score of Carter Burwell and the acting of Brendan Fraser. Burwell's original score, which he co-orchestrated and conducted, is a marvellous achievement. Never calling attention to itself, it beautifully captures and creates the mood of this tale. Combining some "ancient" with "contemporary" styles, Burwell weaves a hypnotic spell, in a most commendable piece of film scoring. Fraser's work is likewise so subtle in its naturalism that only repeated viewings reveal the rich depth and intricacy of his enactment. Every nuance of his character is executed with dead-center precision, as Actor Fraser and Character "Clayton Boone" become one in the same. Possessing a technique so imperceptible that it seems effortless, Fraser seamlessly captures and creates the essence of "Clay" with mesmerizing craftsmanship. Fraser's use of tonal and pitch variations bear added interest: from deep lows to extreme highs, his timbre ranges from sharp and bombastic to quiet and soothing. Likewise, his facial expressions are realized down to the smallest detail. He is so completely committed to his character and executes it so brilliantly that his performance achieves a rarity: a model screen acting portrait. What a pleasure to discover these two awesome talents. All I can say is, "Bravo, Messrs. Burwell and Fraser, along with the rest of the super-talented cast and crew of 'Gods and Monsters.'"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine Trio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gods and Monsters" offers some stellar performances, headed by Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser and Lynn Redgrave.This star trio creates mesmerizing chemistry in the subtle interpretations of their respective characters. McKellen is most moving as legendary film director James Whale, long retired and concerned about his failing health. McKellen's sensitive delivery, timing and occasional outbursts of emotion are hypnotic.Fraser's Clay Boone is equally skillful, displaying a remarkable range of facial expressions and an extraordinary ability to listen. Fraser's mobile face is reminiscent of the late Jack Carson, in its ability to smoothly alter expressions as many as a dozen times during a single scene. The interaction between Fraser and McKellen are compelling throughout, leading to a climax of emotional power.The viewer may wonder half way through the film when Lynn Redgrave is going to appear, only to discover she was on from the first scene as Hanna. Redgrave's landmark makeup is enhanced by her masterful characterization, including a most impressive accent. The rest of the cast is uniformly fine. The decision to graft the supposedly fictional character of Clayton onto Whale's real life story, theoretically diminishes the film's validity as authentic biography. However, it's unlikely that most viewers will consider that point to be very important. What is recognized is a fine trio of performances heading an oustanding cast, making "Gods and Monsters" a compelling and memorable film work.</fullReview>

It touches directly in the very heart of that art - the power of memory to crounch as deep as possible. It also has some beautiful things to say about war, and it's continous effect in a man's entire life experience. I don't know what James Whale would have said seeing this movie. But for anyone who understands movies, and wars, and memories, and above all loneliness - this one is definatly the best. It's a msterpiece in the full scale of the word, and hell with the critics how never touched this art. I've seen many films in my short life, but do consider it, and will consider it, one of the most intelligent, emotional, and exciting films i have ever seen. It's not neccessery to add but i will just say that the actors are ALL magnificant, starting with Mr. Mackilan who's the peck of english actors as Mr. Whale, Vnessa Redgrave is the most funny, series, and heart breeaking god loving "nanny", and Brandon Fraser, which I don't understand why he appears in so many lousy films, he is such a talent, I hope to see more of that talent. Add a genius screenplay and directing, a wonderful music, and a beautiful cinematic style, Gods and monsters is a feast to the eyes, to the brain, and above all to the heart. And it's surly the best film I hae ever seeing that discusses cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Psychological Biography" Fails To Fly High</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of the last days in the life of James Whale (played by Ian McKellen), most famous as the director of the movies "Frankenstein" and "Bride of Frankenstein."The movie is generally very well done. We get a strong sense of Whale's emotional state as he struggles to come to terms with what might be best described as the "monsters" in his own past. What I found most disappointing, though, was that we really learned very little about Whale. He was a homosexual who, up to the last days of his life, had a particular attraction to younger men. Not exactly shocking by today's standards. He was left emotionally scarred by his experiences in the trenches during the First World War. Most who fought in that war were. There was simply nothing in any of this that really caught my attention as being worth the effort obviously put into the movie.The most interesting exploration - which the movie did, quite appropriately, keep coming back to - was Whale's relationship to the two "Frankenstein" movies he directed. Here we begin to see a man torn. On the one hand there was obvious pride in the fame these two movies brought him. On the other hand, there were obvious moments when we can see that Whale wants to be known as more than "just" a "horror movie director." "Frankenstein" becomes both the high point of his career, and the thing that holds him back. Again, though, this is hardly unique. Fine actors are typecast all the time; many directors get associated with one genre in particular even though their talents are much broader.The performances in this movie were generally good. McKellen does a fine job as Whale, and Brendan Fraser as Clay Boone, the straight lawn keeper at Whale's estate who nevertheless captures Whale's attention, offers a strong piece of work. Undoubtedly the funniest line in the movie is Whale introducing Clay to Princess Margaret with the words "he's never met a princess - only queens!"So, the acting is good and the movie is technically well put together and seems to offer a fairly accurate portrayal of Whale's last days. The simple problem with it is that it appears to be a biography of a man who - sorry to say - just doesn't seem to have been overly interesting. I rated it 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christopher Bram speculates about the death of director James Whale in his book "Father of Frankenstein." It was deemed a suicide, and Bram fills in the blanks that the facts that led to it leave. It's masterly guesswork about the demise of an artist who in his heyday created an image that is forever etched in the consciousness of the moviegoing public: a flat-headed, megacephalic monster with bolts in his neck we all know as Frankenstein. Whale had been dying of a disease that left his mind unravelled, a mass of memories and mush, when what's left of his attention turns to thoughts of lust and he feasts his eyes on his new gardener, a wannabe Marine with a beautifully outsized head named Clay Boone. He's straight, and Whale cunningly sets out to seduce him. Their relationship develops into one of interest and intrigue, revulsion and regard, and surprises us with the impression Clay's brush with Whale has left him.I wish I could say that Bill Condon had done Bram's story justice. Oscar apparently thought so, but the movie version "Gods and Monsters" is disappointing. It's bland and placid when you want it to be daring and downright dirty. It's respectful when you want it to be irreverent and imaginative. The flashbacks to the movie set of "Bride of Frankenstein" are flip when you want Condon to establish a sense of dedication and seriousness to moviecraft. The wandering memories about the painful past of Whale slip by when you want them to take hold of you and never let go.As good as Ian McKellen is, his work here is not as impressive as his nastiness in an earlier release from the same year--the adaptation of a Stephen King novel: "Apt Pupil." McKellen plays James Whale like a cagey, desperate rat, but the sum total of his performance is too urbane to grip you. He's wily, but his calculations don't add up to anything memorable. It floats away like that slow-motion fantasy long-shot of Frankenstein walking against a barren horizon.The surprise is Brendan Fraser. He is the perfect embodiment of Clay Boone, and yet he seems not quite right for the part. Maybe Fraser is too sensitive-looking; this actor has such expressive eyes that he seems all wrong in a dive, wasting his time with easy lays and odd gardening jobs. You feel as though he was capable of matching his new acquaintance's eloquence, bon mot for bon mot. Yet Fraser makes you feel that underlying attraction Boone has for Whale. It's less sexual than a brand of flirtatious movie-idol worship that we've never seen quite this way on the screen before. It's new and maybe the only thing in the movie you can take away with you.It may also be new to the screen for us to see a distaff version of a hunchbacked Igor-like sidekick that Lynn Redgrave plays as Hanna, Whale's housekeeper. Redgrave's ungainliness is played for laughs again, but her Hanna refuses to be taken lightly. There are times when you wished you saw Hanna in her own milieu--with her family and friends--so she didn't seem so much like a caricature. But what time she is allowed in front of the camera makes its points. Redgrave makes it clear that the once-world-renowned director could not have had a more devoted, caring servant.Jack Plotnick disgraces himself as a silly fan/interviewer who submits to a casual striptease for the interview.</fullReview>

Unfortunately about 50% of the movie is about Jimmy repeatedly flirting with Boone, and various other boys and men. Once was enough to give us an idea of that side of JW, but the rest was excessive and boring.

		<fullReview>Gods and Monsters is a film for the actors. Ian McKellan's performance is one of the best of the year. His manipulations and plots, fears and memories all come together to form a picture of a complete man at the end of his life. Most of the time the script helps McKellan by providing him with scenes that reflect the past onto the present.The problems start with Brendan Fraser. A worse performance would be hard to coax out of an amateur. Besides his impressive physicality, he brings nothing to the role. Any of the scenes that focus on him rather than McKellan are disasters. Just what was going on between him and the waitress anyway? Lynn Redgrave is fine, but rather flat. She has little to work with but does make the best of it.The script is, as stated above, fine, but it is not excellent. It does a good job of bringing together many of Whale's memories into a shifting pattern of emotions and thoughts. It also links him to the lost generaton of World War I quite well, but it fails to connect the intervening years and the art Whale produced to that period. The film ends up being a bit slight, but it is recommended for McKellan.</fullReview>

Here, Whale befriends his hunky, heterosexual groundskeeper (with the hilariously butch name Clayton Boone) and hearkens back on his glory years in Hollywood. Art-house hit was almost immediately overrated by critics and audiences eager to praise something that at least touched upon human frailties and emotional conflicts. It does manage some moving moments, but Brenden Fraser's working-class caretaker is such a cliché by now--and Ian McKellan's attempts at seduction are so ham-handed--that the film occasionally verges on camp. Still, McKellan does some interesting work in the lead and the picture has convincing atmosphere and detail. Based on the novel "Father of Frankenstein" by Christopher Bram.

		<fullReview>Gods &amp; Monsters is a fascinating , sprawl of epic proportions that lurks tantalizingly in the failing mind of its main character. We get the sense that we've walked in on the last act of a great play and wonder what the rest was like.Many have summarized the film here--Aging gay Hollywood director seeks engaging relationship with somewhat dense gardener. I will not bore you with the details. Sir Ian's acting is top drawer as is the ever wonderful Redgrave as the doting housekeeper. Frasier is batting a little out of his league but is serviceable as the beefcake "love interest." The writing is excellent and brings to life some wonderful character studies. It holds up until the next to last scene which I saw as a bit awkward and forced. Such an elegant script could have found a more plausible circumstance to achieve the desired result.So...what is the film about? Well, it's about being gay and not being gay; about being lonely when surrounded by people who supposedly love you; about giving it all up while still trying to hold on. While most epics spend hours trying to resolve these types of issues, Gods &amp; Monsters is content to show us that such issues exist without resolution. It's an epic in a box...and is a better film for it.</fullReview>

Reversed here for an English man of advanced age who embodies the classic of literature Frankenstein as its film director, hallucinating and coming to grips with his adolescence, sexuality and his current life as he faces terminal disease. In "Dreamchild" with precisely the same scenario, it is an English woman of advanced age who embodies the classic Alice in Wonderland as the girl it was written for, hallucinating and coming to grips with her adolescence, sexuality and her current life as she faces terminal disease. Hallucinated scenes from their classic tales become interwoven with scenes of real daily encounters as they cope with impending death and a Pirandellian blending of the actual and the imagined. But Coral Browne in "Dreamchild" makes peace with her hallucinations and her youth. McKellen doesn't. Instead in this invented insult to the life of James Whale we get another tortured, masochistic homosexual role a la William Hurt in "Kiss of the Spider Woman" groveling after a disdainful straight male. More angst violence and suicide for gays! Hooray just what we need to see in a film right after Matthew Shephard's murder. Oh joy, "The Children's Hour" for the 90s, only this time were so elevated we use the words queer and homosexual in the film as if that gave it validation. It's just more typical H'wood negative slime on gay themes. The ending is utterly repulsive; don't bring kleenex, bring your barf bag. And the Corman-level FX of the Frankenstein hallucinations in "Gods and Monsters" can't hold a candle to the sophisticated FX of the Wonderland hallucinations in "Dreamchild". Redgrave's acting is so pathetically comic book in a so-called serious drama you want to slap her while the performances of the supporting cast are lower than provincial college theatre.

		<fullReview>This superb biographical film of the B-movie director James Whale (Frankenstein 1931, Bride of Frankenstein 1935, The Invisible Man 1933 and Show Boat 1936) has been put on my shelf for many years after my first viewing almost 10 years ago. I have no background information about the director and his works neither, but the worldly- famous Frankenstein franchise has no international barrier here, the interlinked amalgamation of the monster in his film and the director's own later years is a magic maneuver, which includes the identity reversal of the creator and the monster, its sociological overtone reflects vividly in our epoch. The strong cast is the cornerstone of the film, Ian McKellen finally has achieved the performance of his lifetime, he has devoted himself whole-heartedly as the wrenched director on his preordained destiny and emancipated an empowering dominance all over his scenes, his skillful theatre experience enhances both the pathos and the momentum of his tragic fate, which come so strong as to leave me unprepared for an emotional thrust. Brendan Fraser as the opposite drop-dead gorgeous gardener, exudes an angelic attractiveness which has lost in all his subsequent films. Alongside with Sir McKellen, the late Lynn Redgrave also received her second Oscar nomination for her role, the trustworthy maid who annotates the most sophisticated human emotion mixed with unrequited passion, admiration, jealousy, desperation and many others from a rather plain character, which is a textbook epitome of interpretation a supporting role. Another linchpin of the film lies firmly in its Oscar-winning script, full of witty remarks which could be a tug-of-war between sardonicism and sympathy, by comparison Bill Condon's directional capacity is being overshadowed. Anyway, Gods &amp; Monsters has become one of my all-time favorite now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a story of a closet case</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a complex film. Here is yet another way of looking at it based on my own experience being a well known homosexual.The Brendan Fraser/Clayton Boone character has an internal demon. He is partly gay, but his religious programming means he must suppress this, even to himself. Unconsciously, he wants the Ian McKellen/James Whale character to talk him out of his reticence and self hate. I don't think though Boone is particularly attracted to Whale.Clayton alternates between compassion, flirtation and gross rudeness as his two sides battle internally.This is maddening for Jimmy Whale. Clayton is sexy as all get out, but Jimmy is too old and tired even if Clayton were to agree to sex. He has to put up with Clayton's cruel derision. Whale feels compassion for the poor closet case. Whale wishes he were young and appealing enough to have an affair with young Boone. The best he can do is show Clayton off as a trophy.I always thought of Brendan Fraser as pudgy, but in this role his torso is awe inspiring. It just drives poor Mr. Whale mad with frustration when Clayton teases him with it. It is that frustration as much as the shame of his own decrepit body and skills that leads to his suicide.I think most people view the film only as Boone having compassion for Whale. They have no idea how annoying, frustrating and time consuming a closet case can be.This is the exact opposite of an action film. There is not much plot. This is a film to study rather than to sit back and be entertained by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2 Great Actors, 1 Great Movie!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm guilty of being partial to Brendan Fraser, loved him in "The Mummy" series and his character in "Scrubs", and "Crash". Sir Ian McKellen, of course as Gandolf, I'm waiting, most anxiously to see him in "The DaVinci Code"!! "Gods and Monsters" was a tough movie to watch, so I know it had to be damn hard to act it! Physically speaking, it goes without saying, hard!(That's not a play on words, please) Be it half hypothetical or not, deals with very real human life. It seems to me, that he (Whale) was the type to choose his destiny, and rightly so! The absolute rage one would have at losing all control from within to without would just be searing! Losing the relationship between yourself and your own memories, thoughts, capabilities, freedom, how can we stand it?! So, he reaches out. Not out of desiring or lust, he reaches out to this young man, who is, any young man, really. Not fully knowing Whales' intentions, somehow sees this relationship to the point that he begins to understand him. An older man, failing, knowing, he's failing, simply in need of a friend. I think, that, as any man, he learns that even homosexuals need 'just friends' too, or perhaps that older people are rich with 'history' and though may be forgotten still breathes air, pumps blood, remembers, loves, angers and needs. This movie made me feel these things, the fear of boundaries, am I enough of a person to recognize that someone may need me, and can I be strong enough to be there for them. Nostalgia. Fear of solitude fear of darkness. And renewed strength in life. My respects and appreciation to all who made this movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ian McKellen deserved an Oscar for this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ian McKellen stars as James Whale in this sad drama about a fictional account of the last years of Director James Whale (Directed Frankenstein, The Invisible Man, Show Boat). Ian McKellen truly commands this picture with his masterful performance. There are several monologues in this picture that should capture the audience, involving depression, disgust, sarcasm.Brendan Fraser too was very good as Clayton Boone, the yardman who befriends the aged James Whale.This directing style is similar to Whale's pictures. For example, it is the little things, like when Hanna the maid is cleaning up the kitchen, she throws the eggshell in the sink as a slight moment of comic relief, she also eats a leftover off a plate while she is cleaning it. It is the simple little things that are similar to say the Invisible Man where Mrs. Hall takes a drink and licks her lips in a bizarre manner as comic relief. Director Bill Condon really truly understands Whales methods.This film is remarkable. Ian McKellen deserved an oscar for his performance. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a bit confused what to make of this film. The movie is neither entertaining nor boring, neither great nor bad. The only thing that can be said for sure is that the overall acting is very good. Not only are the two main characters perfectly cast, but they also have perfect chemistry onscreen. But that's about it, what can be mentioned as real highlights. It's obvious that Brendan Fraser's character is sort of a stand-in for the social misfit, for Frankenstein, but spoon-feeding this in the very last scene in the rain is really unnecessary. I also didn't like how the flashbacks are used - they seem to be used at the wrong places.Did I gain more insight into social outsiders or homosexual men by watching this movie? I don't think so. Was I moved or touched by the characters' story? No. But still there's something about "Gods and Monsters" that hinders me from dismissing this film entirely...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had Immence Unrealized Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always had a deep seeded respect for Sir Ian McKellan. He is an incredible actor who will do both artistic threature roles and Campy Pop-Culture roles (Magneto in "X-Men") with the same incredible flair. When he needs to play a villian, he's slimy and evil, when he played a hero he's powerful, and respectable. However this movie proves, that when he plays a Homosexual, he's streotypical, and exagerated.One of the things I've always apreciated about Ian McKellan is the fact that depsite being gay he won't rub your face in it. Most homosexuals in hollywood play it for all it's worth, volenteraly typcasting theirselves, untimately discrediting homosexuals by sterotyping them as Lusty and promiscuous. Sir Mckellan refuses to do this, he acts in a dignified and mature way. He can walk in and out of an interveiw and never mention his Homosexuality once, and when he does he casualy refers to it as he would the kind of cloths he wears, or what kind of food he eats. You won't see him marching down the red carpet at the oscars wearing a rainbow bracelet and acting fruity for the cameras, giggling like a school girl and swishing around. He's not ashamed of what he is, but he won't make a big deal out of it.However, I am not sure what to draw from his performance in this film. Like most independant films it atemps to draw atention to itself by being as controvertial as posible. It seems most of Jim Wales rather disturbing comments about his homosexuality (As well as his behavior) dosn't fit well with other scenes of him acting like a complete gentleman. It's almost obvios the screenwriter was throwing in thing to make the critics talk, instead of just writing a stable plot like they should have.The plot was enjoyable, the characters were likable and the directing was fantastic. Sir Mckellan's performance was outstanding, as well as Brenden Fraisier, who proved he's more than gunplay and witty remarks. The movie is a solid, enjoyable production.However, in the end I'm disapointed. Instead of leaving it an incredible story, something that empowers and inspires, it winds up being almost juvinile at some points. What could have been a film masterpeice, winds up being a novelty.In the end I'd have to say this film missed alot of potential. It could have struck a blow against homosexual sterotypes, but by throwing in unnecessary disgusting dialogue at some points it instead does a great diservice.I lost alot of respect for Sir McKellan, I thought he was above this.</fullReview>

After I watched it, I thought differently about James Whale, I thought that the next time I watch Frankenstein I would think about the story of James Whale. I probably will, but I will not care about it because Frankenstein is great as is Gods and Monsters. I am trailing off my point, I enjoyed Gods and Monsters, you will too, it is interesting to know what someone can think about, such as the novel it is based on, "Father of Frankenstein", Christopher Bram is brilliant in creating that story as is Bill Condon directing it. I have never seen Ian McKellen before, and he is a great actor, he was perfect for the role, as was Brendan Fraser, he looks a bit like The Monster, so he fits it. This film reminds me of the old Frankenstein films, all the old films, it reminds me of it, its slower story line, its mood, its acting, obviously the setting, it is a mixture of new and old like films, bottom line, excellence!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully spiritually uplifting, sometimes hard, film that offers much food for thought delivered in an accessible and digestible way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to surpass the current review on the site; Only to say that I went to see Gods last night with a friend and it surpassed both our expectations.I was worried that it might be another eccentric, boring and shallow film that people only go to see because it has a gay element to it. My friend thought it was going to be some dated, poor production about yet another desperado forgotten Hollywood star.Gods is far from these. It is a wonderful interpretation of the last weeks of Jimmy Whale's life and most importantly of the friendship that he shares with Hannah, his housekeeper and Clayton his gardener (come model). It deals with the strong emotional turmoil that fear can cause within each one of us. It demonstrates a spiritually uplifting resolution and conclusion to this life struggle... simply by confronting fear and taking the proverbial bull by the horns.The film also introduces a great deal of compassion and understanding which transcends all else. Thankfully Condon tastefully uses wit and humour (at times frivolous and off the cuff) to lighten the otherwise heavy tone of the film which renders it much more accessible and digestible to the audience.Ian McKellen delivers, for me, an Oscar winning performance as an eccentric, sometimes self-indulgent manipulative old man. Lynn Redgrave gives an excellent support performance and Brendan Fraser gives a surprisingly convincing one. Jack Plotnick also offers some titillating humourous moments.The camera work and direction is almost flawless and really puts the icing on this rich rich cake.The ending is emotional, evocative, serene and dignified.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a shame that the last two minutes of this movie is the prime thing I most remember about it. Ian McClellan gives an incredible performance. Brandon Fraser is underrated himself. It explores very well issues of homoeroticism, relations of gays to straight men, what gays had to go through in previous eras. Although some may object to the "tortured homosexual" portrayal, let's face it, this was the reality of gay life then, and I think what Whale went through was very real. Unfortunately the last scene, which I don't want to give away, is at the very least unnecessary and a tired cliche, woefully out of sync with the unique quality of the rest of the movie. Worse, from my view point, is a the kind of slap in the face from Hollywood towards gays that I thought was finally dead and buried. I'm told there was a lot of gay talent behind this movie. I really do not understand what happened here--a real bummer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple but very touching and wonderfully acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were three reasons why I wanted to see Gods and Monsters. One is because it was about James Whale, the director who gave us those innovative classics Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. The second is that I love Ian McKellen, and when I saw he was going to play James Whale I thought expect a great performance from a great actor. The final reason is the late Lynn Redgrave.After seeing the film, I was really impressed. The period detail is sublime, costumes, sets and scenery are gorgeous and the cinematography is excellent. Another delight was the footage of Bride of Frankenstein for example, that were great to watch. The story is very simple but it is very effective and touching, the score is haunting and beautiful and the screenplay is very well written and insightful.The film is also very elegant and poignant set during Whale's twilight years where Whale was ostracised for being a box office failure and homosexual. While there is the occasional drug-addled sexual hallucination and the story is very simple, Gods and Monsters does explore the horror genre with effortless assurance and wit, while making interesting and powerful pointers of friendship for example.And of course the acting is excellent. Ian McKellen as I have said already was one of the reasons why I wanted to see this film, and he gives another brilliant performance in the title role. Brendan Fraser also gives one of his better performances as the heterosexual gardener, while Lynn Redgrave gives a marvellous turn as Whale's housekeeper.Overall, touching and wonderfully acted. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sleep of reason breeds monsters but no gods.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was better than I'd thought it would be, a story of the final days of James Whale (Ian McKellan), director of the original Frankenstein movies and several others, focusing on his relationship with his gardener (Brendan Fraser) and especially on the memories dredged up by Fraser's presence.I know that sounds pretty turgid and I can't say there's a lot of action in the movie. Nobody wraps a speeding car around a telephone pole or dives off a cliff or wrestles King Kong. And it's not really even about making movies or being queer, but rather about being old and being "overcome by nostalgia," as McKellan puts it. It's a thoughtful and even daring film.I didn't see much in the way of gods, but monsters abound, not only in flashbacks to "Frankenstein" and "The Bride of Frankenstein." It's the early 1950s. As Whale, McKellan lives a life of comfortable isolation, tended by his brusque housekeeper Hanna. One sunny afternoon he asks Fraser to knock off clipping the hedges and sit for a charcoal sketch. Only gradually does the innocent Fraser realize he's dealing with an old-fashioned unreconstructed British pouf. It terrifies and repels Fraser but, as we see later, Fraser's life is pretty arid as well, and a bit on the phony side. If at first he claims to have been a Marine who saw combat in Korea, it's later revealed that he never finished boot camp.The two attend a party for Princess Margaret given by director George Cukor. Whale and Cukor exchange a couple of catty remarks, and then McKellan is called away to meet his "monsters." Both Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester are at the party but they aren't monsters at all, but rather two old friends who are cheerfully aging.The real monsters, as McKellan tells us, are "up here" -- tapping his temple -- but he might as well have said "down here" and tapped his groin. The monsters that plague both James Whale and his gardener are bleak presents and shameful pasts.There are also intimations that Fraser is McKellan's monster brought back to life. The last scene shows us Fraser, years later, wandering down an alley in the rain, holding his arms out, stumbling awkwardly, in imitation of the original. I suppose a case could be made that Fraser, in reminding McKellan of one of his early and never-forgotten lovers from the trenches during World War I, does precipitate a certain anguish in the ailing man, but here the director/screenwriter is stretching the analogy, or maybe just fell for a picturesque final shot. There is the occasional anachronism too -- "You creep me out" -- but they don't glare at us. Otherwise the period detail is accurate enough. Fraser smokes cigarettes and has an attack of what's called homosexual panic when McKellan puts some moves on him.Fraser is adequate as the somewhat dim gardener, but Ian McKellan is splendid as the slim and elegant James Whale, the sham gentleman. What a performance.I won't describe the end of the relationship between the two men. It's not tragic but pretty sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst piece of garbage I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My negative opinion of this "gay film" is valid because of two reasons: I've been openly gay for almost ten years and secondly, I have a degree in cinema production. Since this is a "gay" movie, I am fully qualified to say "What a stupid movie!"The reason why gays are so discriminated against and being gay-bashed on the streets is because of people like the James Whale character in "Gods and Monsters." He's a perverted old old old man chasing after every cute young male that comes his way. He is a predator who takes in every bad stereotype of the gay community. Unfortunately, most heterosexuals believe that gays are as perverted and sleazy as the James Whale character in this movie. If gays want to change that image, this movie isn't going to help any.The only other "openly gay" character in the film was the wimpy, effeminate Edmund Kay (played by Jack Plotnick). Edmund is a sissy personified running around in his underwear like he was at an orgy. Speaking of orgies, there was one offensive scene that had a group of male whores parading around James Whale's home naked.My whole life I've never acted like any of these dumb gay characters. Why can't I ever see a normal gay character in a movie that is more like me? I've never "chased" after a straight guy, acted like a predator or behaved in a sleazy way. I also don't drink, take drugs or smoke. In this film, James Whale is suicidal and that is also something I've never been.In closing, I wish the gay community (and the straight community) would politely decline to see movies like this and demand better from Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine performances by all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gods and Monsters" released in 1998, but set in 1950's Hollywood, boasts some fine performances. Ian McKellan plays film director James Whale, most known for directing "Frankenstein" and a few sequels. The aging Whale becomes infatuated with his young hunky gardener, played by Brendan Fraser. Fraser is playing very much against type here, considering what roles he was known for then and now. Fraser plays Clayton, a man who has some ambition about becoming an actor. Lynn Redgrave is also on hand, playing Whale's stern maid. Redgrave's performance is a hoot -- she plays it very much over-the-top, but it works great for the role (she received an Oscar nomination). This film, on the surface, seemed to be about the aging gay guy (McKellan) versus the young good-looking straight guy (Fraser). While this plays into every stereotype about gay men (they lust after every straight guy -- which is nonsense), I was pleasantly surprised that it is about so much more. Clayton seems to long for a father figure, having never been close to his own. He seems to find that a bit in Whale, although we are never sure whether his attempts to please Whale are self-serving (his ambition) or that he really may like him as a friend and father figure. The film has an odd ending and takes some twists and turns, so I won't give all that away, but a few notes about the performances. Some comments seem to suggest Brendan Fraser was miscast. I disagree. While it's true he has to hold his own next to two veteran actors of stage and screen (McKellan and Redgrave) his role is far more complex and difficult than either of the two leads. It is a shame Fraser hasn't done more dramas. Anyway, this is a decent film with good production values. Even if you are turned off by the subject matter, open your mind enough to give it a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Career, leisure, love, friendship, and life..this film covers it all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gods and Monsters is an independent movie in the best sense of the word, in that it really engenders thought and emotion, and on many tracks simultaneously.The movie is a parable on the end of life, and the desperate need for love when all one has is memories. By extension, its about the importance of friendship as a support when romantic love is not available. In addition, the film is one of the frankest looks at homosexuality I've ever seen, dealing with the dynamics of a young straight man dealing with a gay man whom he wants to befriend, and an old gay man who has nostalgia both for a life of hedonism and a young true love lost, in the most terrible of circumstances.The movie also covers the notion of war, gallows humor, and the way they instructed Whale and his Frankenstein movies. All in all, its amazing the multiple intents of this film, but they're all woven together into a tight script derived from a fictionalized account of Whale's last days (the author gives his full blessing in the DVD special features).I'm surprised I missed this film in 1998, especially with the incredible cast. I expected a low-budget docudrama, possibly campy, moderately engaging, but its far more than that. The topic of homosexuality is dealt with extremely frankly, but lovingly and honestly, while not playing it safe either. It's a tribute to the director that the plot line of Whale's sex life opens briskly, but then illustrates the greater point that this is a man with a spirited past who is breaking down. Gay or not gay, his sexuality was part of him being alive, and its role as both recreational fun, and deep love, are both acknowledged.McKellan proves why he gets the raves, not just covering the gamut of wit, sadness, irritation and anger, but nailing the idiosyncrasies of a man hallucinating with nostalgia, and steadily losing his mental faculties.Redgrave creates a character close to a cartoon, but she does not waver from that character's reality, and is somehow instantly inviting.Fraser is convincing as both the attractive draw to McKellen, but also the lost young man, and the empathetic innocent who just wants to find something tangible in life.In the midst of all this, they give tribute to the amazing story of Frankenstein, and the film flashbacks are where the film loses some balance. The turn of McKellen/Whale being haunted by his own creation, his life, is very thought-provoking. The story McKellen gives about his young male lover dying in the trenches and it becoming a dark joke for everyone is particularly heart-breaking. In a sense, the dark humor that was supposed to help with the monster of war became the monster in and of itself. As convoluted as this may seem, it actually really provoked me to think deeper about the entire Frankenstein parable, which is, of course, a masterpiece of story and character.Finally, the film makes a very compelling point about the critical importance of friendship and human contact. You get a lot in 106 mins, and the climax is purely emotional. Fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for an insider's look into Hollywood, this isn't your movie. "Gods and Monsters" has little to do with the process of making films, but it does contain an interesting look at one of cinema's most memorable contributors. Though it is flawed, it is nonetheless interesting.There's really not much story. James Whale (Ian McKellan) is a retired film director, living out the rest of his days in peace and solitude with his housekeeper, Hanna (a delightful Lynn Redgrave). Enter a new gardener named Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser), and the homosexual Whale is immediately interested ("You have the most architectural skull..."). Thus begins an examination of the tortured James Whale, which we get mostly through his interaction with Clayton.Most film goers know Ian McKellan as Gandalf the Grey. While that may have been the role that made him famous to mainstream viewers, his portrayal of James Whale is his best performance. Everything from his mannerisms to the randomly vacant expression, it works. Lynn Redgrave is delightful as his housekeeper, but Redgrave seeks to develop a character instead of someone who is on hand for comic relief.Brendan Fraser may be known as the guy heading "The Mummy" franchise (the modern one, not the original), but every now and then he takes a role like this to remind us he's an actor, not someone who can just run and shoot mummies all day. Clayton Boone may seem like a dumb jock at first, but there's more to him than meets the eye. He develops a friendship with Whale (it's clear he's not gay), and Fraser and McKellan have great chemistry together.I like Bill Condon's work. He adds a richness to the characters and the story that is totally his own. Most significantly, however, is how he addresses weighty topics with a lighter tone, while still respecting the material. His first major effort behind the camera is not as successful as his later film, "Kinsey," in this respect. Condon doesn't allow any connection between the cast and the audience, and that limits the involvement of the audience, thus robbing it of much of its power. Still, he wrote a strong script that allows the actors to create unique, three-dimensional individuals, even though we don't exactly feel it.There are some major flaws with "Gods and Monsters," but overall, I liked it. The whole doesn't live up to the sum of its parts, but the pieces of it are strong in and of themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting character study, but will not be everyone's cup of tea.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a snapshot in the retirement life of James Whale, director of monster movies. Mr Whale is a bored homosexual who enjoys the company of nice young men, even if they are heterosexual themselves. He plays games with their emotions, and comes across as a pathetic individual. It is an interesting character study, and offers some glimpse into the "Hollywood" in-crowd, but is not a memorable movie. Most of the movies I've seen are better, and the most I can give it is "6" out of 10. In the end I didn't really care about Whale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rated this film a "5". The screenplay and the performances were excellent. Lynn Redgrave especially good. The entire presentation was very clean and to the point. However, it is not a film for a cold winter's night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don´t get ít!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this movie 3 hours ago, and watch it. I was very excited, and thought this movie would be more than just a normal movie, I thought it would have something special. but I was wrong. This movie was so absolutely boring i didn´t made the 106 minutes, and I can not understand why this movie got an oscar, and what does this movie in the top 250. That movie does not deserve to be there, I will never get it. I vote this movie with 2 points. Even when you understand the story, (certainly I did) i can not imagine how this movie got an average of 8.3. sorry but i don't get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So, did someone drop acid before writing this script?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, what in god's green earth was this movie actually about? I watched it twice and it still makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. If I could go back, I would take a two-hour bathroom break in lieu of sitting through this atrocious flick. So here's the general overview: Brendan Fraser is an ex-Marine now gardener/hottie for this overly excentric former movie director, who is in fact a total freak. Brendan models for him, basically because he likes the attention and also likes to hear the creepy old man tell him stories from his heyday. He gets really freaked out because the geriatric is a homosexual and even more freaked out when the bed-wetting schizophrenic asks Fraser to kill him (while posing nude - which I will never understand). He won't do it so he drowns himself in the pool. Boohoo. Anyways, the plot is so weighted down with muddled thoughts and crazy dreams that the actual point of the movie is completely lost. All I can really say is that the casting was great, and the general story about the two mens' relationship was somewhat touching, but it didn't matter because the flashbacks to events of the past jumbled what was happening in the present and left me wondering "what the hell just happened here?" In any case, rent it if you so desire, just make sure that you don't spend any more than a buck because I was p***ed off I paid fifty cents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Oscar winning writer, and director Bill Condon (Dreamgirls), this is one of the best biographical dramas about one of the most influential horror directors of the 20th Century. Basically this film focuses on the twilight years, aka the final days of the "Father of Frankenstein", James Whale (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sir Ian McKellen), out of the Hollywood lifestyle after box office failure and being homosexual. He is now living at home overcoming many stroke triggers, and with taking his medicine he also has flashes of his past a young man, the Great War, and making Bride of Frankenstein. The story follows his infatuation with heterosexual gardener Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser), who he tells many of his experiences to, and also asks him to model for him to draw his "perfect" head. The only other person that cares, but also disapproves, for Whale is his housemaid Hanna (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Lynn Redgrave). Whale and Boone's friendship is both a bit complicated, and it is obvious that Whale would try and get his way with him at some point, and not long after he does, he commits suicide, drowning in his swimming pool. Also starring Lolita Davidovich as Betty, David Dukes as David Lewis, Kevin J. O'Connor as Harry, Mark Kiely as Dwight, Jack Plotnick as Edmund Kay, Rosalind Ayres as Elsa Lanchester, Jack Betts as Boris Karloff and Matt McKenzie as Colin Clive. Being gay himself, McKellen is brilliant as the frail film director, Fraser is also very good as his admiring and at times challenged gardener, and Redgrave as Whale's housemaid makes a good character in small moments, a touching tribute to a great director with many poignant and powerful points. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Sir Ian McKellen was number 4 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and he was number 5 on Britain's Finest Actors. Outstanding!</fullReview>
