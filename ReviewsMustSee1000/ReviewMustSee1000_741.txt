		<shortDescription>The most original and groundbreaking movie of recent history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen Moulin Rouge at least 25 times. I think it is the most extraordinary movie of my generation and breaks every limit set by the industry. I have heard all the traditional complaints...people didn't like the music, the editing was too swift, or it wasn't "their taste". Moulin Rouge took a risk. A risk films like A Beautiful Mind and Shakespeare in Love don't. It risked by being controversial. To make a likeable movie isn't hard, follow the Hollywood mold and stick in a few attractive actors, some bland dialogue and viola you have a film. Moulin Rouge was made knowing that not everyone would like it, but knowing everyone would at least appreciate it for its artistic ingenuity. Visually it is superb, an indulgent feast for the eyes with every breathtaking, artistic scene. Everything about it is over the top, every scene more stunning than the next, and as it continues your heart becomes more and more intertwined in the love story. The editing in the Roxanne scene rushes through your body and is the most incredible of any movie in history. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor are the most passionate on-screen couple; entirely convincing as their voices meld them together into one. Never has a movie done what Moulin Rouge did. It realized that the world of film is only being represented in one small way, whereas Moulin Rouge uses a camera and screen to make something bigger and more extraordinary than has ever been made before. It pushes against the confines of convention and leaves you breathless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning, visual feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the risk of sounding overly bombastic, "Moulin Rouge" is the best film I've seen all year, perhaps the best one I've seen in over a year. It is operatic in the best sense of the word, being at once massively outlandish and deeply personal. It is clear that a lot of people took career risks in choosing this film, and although "Moulin Rouge" may not rack up a huge box office, I think this film will become a classic alongside his other two films "Strictly Ballroom" and "Romeo + Juliet."In the showing of "Moulin Rouge" I saw last week, at least 5 people walked out. At the same time I heard audience members audibly gasping at the films visuals and talking back to the screen. The source of these strong reactions? Baz Luhrmann's confidence in his garish cinematic vision and the commitment his actors have in him. The cast fills their roles with relish, even when the entire scene totters on the edge of overkill--but oddly enough, it is the focus that sets "Moulin Rouge" apart from other films these days. Whereas some actors sleepwalk through their roles as they collect their paychecks, everything about "Moulin Rouge" is done in earnest.This movie is the anti-"Pearl Harbor," because instead of being a hodgepodge of market-tested ideas, "Moulin Rouge" presents a bold vision and dares the audience to accept or reject it. I, for one, accepted it with delight. A telling comparison: Luhrmann has Nicole Kidman and Ewen MacGregor sing the film's love song. Very daring. For "Pearl Harbor" Michael Bay chose Faith Hill. Very safe. Too safe. Can you imagine Ben Afleck belting out "There You'll Be"?"Moulin Rouge" glitters with such bold decisions. It is a sumptuous feast for ear and eye featuring gorgeous costumes, intricate sets (Nicole Kidman's boudoir in a gigantic elephant is a case in point), and outlandishly choreographed dance numbers are paraded with frenetic relish. And the music, the MUSIC! As you probably know by now, Luhrmann has thrown into his period piece a collage of musical snippets from, among many bits, "The Sound of Music," Madonna, The Police, and Elton John. In most cases, no one song gets performed without intersplicing. Witness Luhrmann's audacity: the opening number includes a melding of Labelle's "Lady Marmalade" with Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit." And here's the spooky part: it works.The entire movie plays this way, and for the most part it works. Most surpising is that "Moulin Rouge" has a solid, deeply sincere emotional core. Although the film professes to be about love, I'd add that it is equally about loss. The Moulin Rouge is a playground where adults pretend they are children with the added spice of sensuality.All the performances are excellent, but the hidden gem is Jim Broadbent as Zidler. Broadbent for years has been doing majestically understated supporting work, from "Brazil" to "Enchanted April" to "Topsy-Turvy." In "Moulin Rouge" he manages to be both repulsive and endearing. His spirited rendition of "Like a Virgin" is classic. Too bad it's not on the soundtrack.Expect to be overwhelmed by "Moulin Rouge" in the most unexpected, delightful ways. It will make you wonder why other films can't or won't dare to be that bold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am in love with "Moulin Rouge"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not ever felt for a movie the way I do about "Moulin Rouge." It is not just a movie...it is a cinematic experience the likes of which I have never before seen. The story, the music, the acting, the visual imagery strikes emotion in me I never before thought possible from a film. It is without a doubt the most brilliant piece of cinematic art I have ever seen. It is dizzy, maddening, beautiful, and heartbreaking! The music is rapturous, and Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman's voices compliment each other and the story perfectly. This movie takes its story to a mythic level and surrounds these two star-crossed lovers with music and imagery that simply will take your breath away. The story is grand, huge, and operatic, as is the music. The brilliant score skillfully weaves many modern, popular songs, and rescores them as the libretto to this grand opera. There are some images in this film unlike anything you have ever seen. And the performances are absolutely incredible, particularly Nicole Kidman's. I truly felt for these two people, and truly felt that they were in love. My heart broke into a million pieces for them every time I saw this movie, and I've seen it 8 times. It's an absolutely breathtaking, visionary, masterpiece that did not get the credit it deserved by American critics, who seem to complain that every movie is the same. Yet when an original, daring, shocking film like this comes along, they don't know what to do with it. But then again, this really is not just a film. No mere film could strike me the way this one has, in a way that reaches to the very fibres of my being in a way only "The Wizard of Oz" ever has before. Yes, the story is sad, but what a journey it takes you on! A journey I will be sure to repeat over and over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few movies out there worth watching several times, just because of the sheer visual and musical enchantment. **** (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MOULIN ROUGE! / (2001) **** (out of four)By Blake French: "Moulin Rouge!" revives our imagination and relives the musical era of Hollywood. The film is like an extravagant, expensive Broadway production on screen, with enough open courage, engrossing passion, and zesty energy for several motion pictures. It's one of the year's best films; "Moulin Rouge!" may be a cliché-ridden love triangle, but Baz Luhrmann, the film's director, shines a fresh, stunning originality on a familiar plot. He creates a candid, exuberant style for his characters-a mixture between a fast-paced music video and lush, exotic images. He uses a vast variety of camera placements and shooting angles. In several of the songs, he cuts on nearly every word. This does indeed make us dizzy, but it is the perfect approach to the material.  From the opening moments, "Moulin Rouge!" plays full force, overpowering our senses. The film doesn't even wait for its opening credits to begin. The usual 20th Century Fox logo appears on the screen within a screen as a little bald musician rises from the bottom, and continues to frantically conduct the traditional Fox fanfare. From this, we cut to "The Sound of Music," where young writer morns over the loss of his true love. The film includes an interesting use of the bookend structure, and I like how it reveals the information about the main character's deadly disease early. This is the kind of movie that does not need to astonish us with sudden plot twists or unexpected character revelations. The joy of watching "Moulin Rouge!" is in the visual stimulation; the plot is more interested in its own character's discoveries than playing mind games with the audience. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman prove that they can really sing. Most of the time, celebrity singers turn to the silver screen with a lot of star power but little acting ability. Look at LL Cool J, Ice Cube, Jennifer Lopez, and I just know Brittany Spears is going to turn up in a movie one of these days. "Moulin Rouge" may be one of the first movies to open musical doors for its leading performers. Even Jim Broadbent proves to be well cast in a crazy, intensified character that he really sinks his teeth into. I will never look at any of these stars in the same light again, even, to my great reluctance, John Leguizamo.The film takes place in the early 19th century, as Christian (McGregor) enters Paris hoping to write love stories. Several peculiar figures live above him, including the French artist Toulouse-Lautrec (Leguizamo) and his Bohemian troupe attempting to construct a play. After a freak accident, Christian is suddenly thrust into the middle of their play. The crew hires him as the star writer. He then takes a visit to the flirtatious Moulin Rouge night club, ran by the robust Harold Zinder (Jim Broadbent). It is here where he tries to persuade the club's popular, sexy lead performer and courtesan, Satine (Kidman), to work in their production. After mistaking Christian for a rich and powerful aristocrat, The Duke (Richard Roxburgh), Satine falls in love with Christian, much to the dismay of many. However, she believes herself to be a simple prostitute, who should never fall in love because it will get in the way of success. When the Duke agrees to produce a major production at the Moulin Rogue, but only under his circumstances, things become even more complicated. The Duke demands that Satine becomes his personal property if Harold and the others want his financial support. Obviously, the best thing in "Moulin Rouge!" is the music. Apart from the cast, the film's big list of musical artists includes David Bowe, Christina Aguilera, Mya, Pink, Fatboy Slim, Beck, and many others. The kind of music that plays here does not account for a period epic at all, however. "Moulin Rouge!" doesn't try to be a historic depiction, but instead an expression of fantasy and passion. The elegant sets, eventful style, and powerful choreography scream modern day, post-pop-culture. I ran out to purchase the motion picture soundtrack. You should, too. But listening to the soundtrack on your CD player at home is nothing like experiencing the memorable singing and dancing, sexual energy, and relentless enthusiasm on the big screen.As I say in very few film critiques, some movies are you watch, others you experience. "Moulin Rouge" is an experience not to be missed. It is a bizarre, unique blend of exhaustive energy and lively action-one of the bravest, most ambitious and entertaining movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a musical for people who don't like musicals.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was easily one of the best movies I've seen in years. Rarely do movies have a visual force capable of stunning you into rapt silence; and even more rare are films able to further this with a soundtrack that can move you and ensnare you as well, if not better, than the images. Yet some how, through genius, magic, luck, or some combination, Moulin Rouge has managed to do both. In truth Moulin Rouge is a fusion of two fabulous films into one. A film of images capable of conveying meaning without dialog or music, and a film which you could feel and understand with out needing to see it. Much effort was obviously spent on both the visual and audio aspects of this film, and by choosing not to focus on one over the other, and sacrifice the songs for the story or vice versa, the filmmakers were able to make a truly unique, modern musical which those of us who have hated musical since childhood could enjoy. Moulin Rouge is a blend of old, established techniques with innovative experimental ones, resulting in a movie which could only have been made in our time, yet which has a classic feel. The acting is wonderful, the mixture of modern songs is ingenious, and the cinematography is at times simply amazing. The end result is a stunning film with unbelievable performances; a cinematic experience that people will be loving, analyzing and trying to imitate for year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie blew my mind. Watch it, then watch it again. 'Moulin Rouge' made me laugh, cry, and dream. It's boldness and confidence to produce something so original and different impressed me. At times the scenery was as surreal as something you would experience in a dream, which only makes this movie more amazing. 'Moulin Rouge' shows love from all angles. It includes the raw passion, infatuation, vehemence, intensity, ecstasy, jealousy, and pain that is found in true love. The acting was staggering. Ewan McGregor is unrealistically perfect, combining sweet innocence with masculinity. Kidman perfectly brings out the seductive side of Satine, yet never loses the vulnerable soul that lies behind it. Roxburgh(The Duke) and Leguizamo(Lautrec) bring out just the right amount of comic relief in this intense drama. There is nothing I would change about this movie. One warning, though: Moulin Rouge is not for the artistically deprived. It is quite a contemporary movie, so you may not like it if you prefer to watch simple movies(ex. 'American Pie', 'Scary Movie').</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular! Spectacular! A unique masterpiece to be seen again and again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have now seen Moulin Rouge more times than I should say and I have noticed something new and unique every time. This film is so intricate (and beautiful) that you cannot possibly absorb it all in one viewing. Luhrman (along with his Bazmark production team) really is a visionary and his films push the limits in such amazing ways. The music, the sets, the choreography - all of it is awe-inspiring. Ewan McGregor proves his versatility as an actor yet again by bringing such a heartfelt innocence to Christian - and the man can sing! Nicole Kidman went from being just another actress to me to one of my favorites - she takes on the role of Satine so honestly and proves that she not only has a comedic side but a great voice as well. Together the two of them light up the screen. In a year of mostly mediocre films (with a few notable exceptions) Moulin Rouge is totally refreshing. It not only promotes truth, beauty, freedom, and love but is a perfect example of them as well. Luhrman himself said that it was time for a new kind of storytelling and he was right! Open your mind and enjoy one of the most original movie experiences in years. A bohemian storm is brewing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder if that line from the Duke "I don't care about your ridiculous dogma" was directed to Lars Von Triar. It could be, the film is full of knowing lines "He could make you a star and you're dallying with the writer!" or "They dressed me with the Argentinean's best clothes and passed me for a famous English writer" There is something of Ken Russell's second period in "Moulin Rouge" Everything is emphasized, underlined and repeated at least three times for safety. Excess seem a rather feeble term to describe it and yet, it works. The film, for the most part, is a delight. Nicole Kidman, ravishing and spectacular, spectacular. Ewan McGregor, superb, and so charismatic that no one would blame me if I confess I had a had crush on him as soon as he broke into "The Hills are alive with the sound of music..." Kidman and McGregor, this film proves it, are the closest thing we've had in years to the big stars of yesteryear. They could make anything shine and they have. Another detail that shouldn't go amiss, "Moulin Rouge" opened the door again for musicals and that's always a good thing even if we're bound to be bombarded by some terrible stuff. I say it doesn't matter as long as it allows glorious film talents of the caliber of Kidman and McGregor to give us the pleasures they have even in a bag of wind such as "Moulin Rouge"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly, It's a Story About Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a story about life. And about the artists who congregated in Paris in 1900, living a bohemian lifestyle and giving the world the fruits of their labor, of their art, for which they would gladly bleed and die. But mostly this is a story about love. Of a young man named Christian, a penniless writer, and a singer named Satine, who for a moment came together and tasted the nectar of the gods. `Moulin Rouge,' written and directed by Baz Luhrmann, takes you into a world that is bright and brilliant, fast and flashy and filled with all of the things that make life worth living. It's a fantasy world of song and color, of soaring hearts and aspirations-- but also of the reality upon which the illusion of it all is built. And the effects of that reality on Christian and Satine, whose love has been forbidden by that same reality they seek to dispel by impaling it with the artistic endeavors that give them life.If Disney had commissioned a film to be written by Shakespeare, directed by Fellini and produced by Spielberg, this would be it. It's a dizzying, whirling burst of lights, colors, music, drama and comedy that assails the senses and will hold you spellbound from beginning to end. Like the bohemians he portrays, Luhrmann leaves convention behind and dips instead into his own inspired and highly imaginative formula to tell his story. The cinematography (by Donald McAlpine) and art direction (by Ann-Marie Beauchamp and Ian Gracie) are brilliant, as well as the production design (by Catherine Martin) and the sets (by Brigitte Broch). One of the many inspired touches Luhrmann employs here, is the use of different film speeds throughout, which, when combined with the superlative, quick-cut editing (by Jill Bilcock), makes it all transporting and surreal.Ewan McGregor turns is a terrific performance as Christian, the young man who arrives in Paris with nothing more than spirit and a head filled with ideas and ideals. When artistic differences leaves Zidler (Jim Broadbent), proprietor of the Moulin Rouge, without a writer for a new show, `Spectacular, Spectacular,' Christian steps in. And so does McGregor, who shines in the part. And the boy can sing! He may not have the greatest voice in the world, but it's a good `stage voice,' and most importantly, he can sell a song, as evidenced by the scene in which he puts across Elton John's `Your Song.' McGregor has a charismatic screen presence, and in this role he really gets a chance to demonstrate his versatility as an actor.As Satine, Nicole Kidman is saucy and sensuous, bringing her character vividly to life, this woman who makes her living by being every man's fantasy as she sings and sashays her way through this world of the Moulin Rouge. In her heart, she longs to be a serious actress, and if this new show is a success, she just may get her chance. But first, the show needs someone to finance the lavish production. They may have one-- the Duke of Worcester (Richard Roxburgh), has expressed interest, but he has one condition. If he pays for the show he wants something in return (besides a profit on his investment). He wants Satine. But so does Christian, who has nothing to offer the show but his talent, and nothing for Satine but his love. Zidler, meanwhile, aware of the Duke's demands, urges Satine to turn her back on Christian, to `save him.' And beyond and besides all that is happening, there is something else going on with Satine, something more personal, that ultimately will have an effect on the outcome of the dilemma for all concerned.The supporting cast includes John Leguizamo (Toulouse Lautrec), Kylie Minogue (The Green Fairy), Garry McDonald (Doctor), Jacek Koman (The Narcoleptic Argentinean), Matthew Whittet (Satie), Kerry Walker (Marie) and Laszlo Lukas (Conductor). With an eye for detail and his imagination thrust into overdrive, Luhrmann has put together and delivered one of the brightest films to come along in quite awhile. `Moulin Rouge' is an explosion of sights and sounds, a film laced with humor and visual largess that holds a poignant and dramatic story at it's heart. Entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable, this is a memorable film and a satisfying movie-going experience. It's a story about love; a story told through the magic of the movies. I rate this one 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just recycled, nothing original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the movie, I gave up after 10 minutes, walked out of the theatre and kicked myself that I just have wasted 8$ on it. I just could not connect the use of modern songs with a historic setting. Convincing myself that I might just have had a bad day, and telling myself to have an open mind, I watched the DVD all the way through. Good grief, what a drag, and was I happy that I have just borrowed it from friends! A poor excuse for a plot, no character development at all, recycled (or, dare I say, massacred) pop songs, recycled ideas (La Boheme, La Traviata, Orpheus in the underworld), and, on top of that, dialogues which are mostly made up of strings of song titles, or repetitions of the key lines of the songs that have just been performed, the rest being commonplace statements. The only amazing thing is the art direction ,scoring a well deserved Oscar, but that's about it! Seemingly, Baz Luhrmann could not decide whether to make a movie (not enough plot) or an MTV video clip (too long, but still using the modern editing style of a video of light-speed camera moves and nano- second scene changes, which makes everyone older than 21 just nauseous!), and , most probably to keep the risk factor low, did not use even the tiniest bit of original ideas! Zip! Zero! Zilch! It has its funny moments, but they are too rare to make up for its shortfalls, such as lack of depth. The term love is used about 1000 times, however I could not connect to the characters (there is just not enough plot), and Satine's death left me stone cold. In short: a total waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inspiring rebirth of the movie musical...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luhrmann's flamboyant musical 'Moulin Rouge' is a combination of Camille, La Boh?me and Showgirls... The film swings easily between present and past, among so many wildly different moods: farce, tragedy, romance, satire, comedy and rock and roll...'Moulin Rouge' is an assault on the senses, a non stop visual explosion, an exotic trip, and a love story that is sure to touch your heart... It is a gloriously cinematic spectacle with opulent imagery directed with an eye for rich color, especially the color of rouge... It is also a breathtaking and poignant piece of cinema, a disco of dreams, a crazy and daring show, a vibrant screen fantasy, a "Bohemian Revolution," a magical movie for those who love romance, pop music and old musical movies...Nicole Kidman gives the film its soul... She is the "sparkling diamond" of the show, the toast of Paris, the city's top courtesan... She melts her characterization with a sizzling, yet tender, performance... She is undeniably sexy, a beautiful singer, a flashy dancer whose heart sings whenever she sees Christian... In many ways, she is drawn as the ultimate sex goddess, as enigmatic as Greta Garbo, and her glamor masks her pain as well as her happiness... Kidman gives the film its central erotic charge, and its romantic thrills... She sways on a flying trapeze belting out Marilyn Monroe's "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend," and Madonna's "Material Girl."Ewan McGregor achieves a nice mix of optimism and desperation, emphasizing the sincerity of the love-struck poet-hero... Christian is a young idealist who moves to the bohemian section of Paris during the 'summer of love' of 1899... He is hired to write a show about 'truth, beauty, freedom and, most of all, love.' Christian battles for the body and soul of the ravishing Satine... His fundamental believe is 'the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and to be loved in return?John Leguizamo is vulnerable and sweet as Henri de Toulouse Lautrec needing a good writer to come up with story and lyrics for his new show called "Spectacular Spectacular."Jim Broadbent is wonderfully comic as the ringmaster Harold Zidler... He is a jovial impresario who peddles the charms of a successful Satine to a mesmerized public... He is the owner of the infamous nightclub who has promised Satine to the evil Duke of Monroth... He has his eye on her too... Richard Roxburgh is odious as the jealous benefactor obsessed with Satine to the point of murder... He is stunningly arrogant wanting the gorgeous can-can chanteuse in an "exclusive contract."Luhrmann combines 1900 Can Can burlesque with modern musical poetry, exploiting Kidman's grace and beauty and overwhelming the audience with frenetic dance numbers delivered in operatic-style... Like Orson Welles, Luhrmann loves the technical magic of movies... When a red curtain opens, an orchestra conductor emerges to direct the unmistakable '20th Century Fox' theme opening, we immediately realize we're in for something really magical: A spectacular costume revue, an eye-catching fin de si?cle exuberance, an inspiring rebirth of the movie musical...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a way, Moulin Rouge typifies everything that's wrong with American cinema by bastardizing everything that's right with its European counterpart. Visually, the movie is a great reference for any commercial or video director. But unlike a music video that lasts only three minutes, Moulin Rouge begins with a visual volume worthy of Spinal Tap and tries to sustain it for 120 minutes. It doesn't work. The rule of dynamics applies as much to a pretentious musical as it does to an ambitious action film. If the volume is too loud, you simply can't hear anything. Everything gets lost in Moulin Rouge's hurricane of desperate art direction and production design. The film's leads, talented actors though they may be, simply aren't charismatic enough to compete. The movie requires posturing, not acting. And, frankly, there are no less charismatic actors than Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. In fact, their appeal is in their pastiness, not in their screen presence. What's more, the music can't compete either. Great songs are dwarfed by the never-ending onslaught of CGI visuals, which, after a while, become tedious. We get it, already. The moral of this story is that you still need one to make a good movie. Nothing can replace pen and paper. Unglamorous though it may be, a good script is everything. The filmmaker's previous effort with Romeo And Juliet worked precisely because he had a great script to begin with. The production design was icing on the cake. With Moulin Rouge, icing is all there is, and a satisfying meal it does not make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superficial depiction of love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When will people figure out that you can't compensate for a lack of TALENT with glitz and glamour. Shaking the camera, inserting quick cuts and using over-the-top sets and costumes may distract some people from this atrocity, but some of us are insightful enough to recognize crap when we see it.This is absolutely the worse editing I think I've ever seen. (The fact that it was nominated for an academy award made me rethink every thought I've ever had. I'm afraid to leave the house now, because I think that was a sign of the coming apocolypse.) The cuts are far to quick and it seems to have arbitrary cutaways thrown in that make no sense whatsoever. It was impossible to follow, because there isn't a single shot in this movie that lasts longer than 2.5 seconds. All flashy cuts do is confuse the viewer. They aren't "hip" or "cool" or "innovative", they're just plain ridiculous (believe me, I know what I'm talking about. I'm a professional editor.) The whole idea of editing is to cut the film together into a coherent story so the viewer can enjoy it-and this film failed miserably. All it did was give me a headache. To be fair, the editor is a very skilled editor who probably was just doing her best with what that no-talent hack of a director gave her. I have to believe the A.D.D. style of cutting was his vision, not hers. Check out Road to Perdition or Elizabeth to see her true skills.What was with the gratuitous slow-motion? Every other shot was in slo-mo for apparantly no reason at all.The singing made me want to sharpen a pencil and shove it directly into my ear. Seeing a fat man singing "Like a Virgin" is going to cost me years of therapy and lots of sleepless nights. Kurt Cobain is turning over in his grave, and if I ever hear "Your Song" by Elton John again, I may set myself on fire to distract me from the pain. ...THE MOON SINGS! What the f**K?Not to mention, the story was awful. This was a just a very superficial depiction of love. The story is what holds a film together. No matter how pretty you make it, without a good story, it's just a complete waste of time. I shudder to think of some potentially great movie that didn't get made because this piece of crap did.I was EMBARRASSED to watch this movie, and I was alone when I watched it, so figure that out. If you are planning on watching it, might I suggest taking an entire bottle of Vicodin beforehand- 'cause it's gonna hurt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can you say "technicolor vomit?" The idea for this film actually has a lot of potential: Take a mish-mash of modern pop songs and blend them together in a creative way to create a romantic musical. But what do we get here? An annoying nightmare of sound and sight that almost drove me from the theater. This film is more chopped up than the vegetables in a Beni Hanna stir fry. Luhrmann never focuses on one scene for more than a few seconds and when he does, the computer enhanced colors make the screen incredibly difficult to look at. The music has moments of creativity, as when "Smells Like Teen Spirit" is blended together with "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend", but all of the scenes come across as little more than videos, not pieces creating a coherent whole. With respect to the choice of songs: Gosh, can you get more random, Boz Luhrmann? I mean, I actually feel like Luhrman put a couple hundred song titles in a hat and just chose them at random. Very strange. And I enjoyed Ewen McGregor's singing for about an hour (I found myself singing "Your Song" with him at the beginning of the film), but then it started to get annoying. And Nicole Kidman...what can one say except, "Yuck." Ever since I saw her in that Battman movie, she just bugs, bugs, bugs. And I was listening to a PJ Harvey tape in my car on the way home from the theater thinking that Harvey would have been a great choice for the part of Seline. But she probably wouldn't have been interested in such an artless film. Finally, why o why does every big budget movie that is set in France have people speaking with British accents? Is this some kind of unconscious Hollywood rule? Or couldn't Luhrmann find anyone with French accents to play in this film? Man, the French must have torn this thing up at Cannes. "I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that put down in words how terrible this film is while it's in this world."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so horrible it made me weep. It wasn't even really a movie; it was an insult aimed directly at everyone who paid $9 to see it.You see, they wanted to do a musical, only they knew people wouldn't go see a musical unless it featured a random assortment of unrelated, canned popular music. Well, I ask, what's the point? Why bother? If you "put together" a musical without writing any music, have you really "put together" a musical? The answer is no.This is the kind of idiocy that _Oklahoma!_ displaced, where the songs are unrelated and the "action" and "character" don't even rise to the level of formality. Only it's worse, because it specifically targets songs which are attached to your memories and butchers them. When I saw them quote out of context the song U2 wrote to commemorate the life and death of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in an idiotic scene on the back of a big fake elephant, I almost walked out. I should have. It only got worse.The only way this would be even permissable would be in parody, but this is no parody. It clearly wants to be taken at least marginally seriously, apparently without going to the trouble of having anything at all to say, unless you count the apparent reality that people are very, very stupid, are essentially devoid of any and all merit, and are not worth watching.Do not believe the hype. Do not see this movie! If you do see it, at least have the good sense to get really, really high first, so that, even if it takes itself seriously, you don't make the mistake of doing so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Am I the only person who simply *HATED* this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read so many posts on this message board concerning the adoration and delight people have expressed for "MOULIN ROUGE", for both its usage of creativity and for its stars, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. I skipped seeing this film when it was playing at the movies but my curiosity was spiked by the time it hit the video rental shelves at my local video store."MOULIN ROUGE" has indeed garnered much favoritism from critic's circles, award panels and esteemed film reviewers alike. Unfortunately, the only award I would hand this film would be a Golden Raspberry.The opening sequence of "MOULIN ROUGE" was interesting enough. I enjoyed the camera sequence going through the city of old Paris as we are introduced to Ewan McGregor's character... and then the film pretty much falls flat on its face from thereon in.I am not Nicole Kidman's biggest fan. I did enjoy her in "THE OTHERS", but I have to say that her performance in this film would be about on par as that in "BMX BANDITS" or "BUSH CHRISTMAS". I thought the musical pieces in "MOULIN ROUGE" were 'ear-bleedingly' awful, especially the sequence where both Ewan and Nicole are serenading each other with snippets of songs such as "I Was Made For Loving You" and "Silly Love Songs". There is one truly awful moment in the film that involves a man screeching out an unforgivable horrendous rendition of The Police's "Roxanne".It was about the scene where John Leguizamo and his side-kicks gate-crash Ewan McGregor's personal home-warming to have him join their performing art troupe where Ewan finds himself bellowing out a sonnet of "The Hills Are Alive" from "THE SOUND OF MUSIC" that I found myself losing patience for this movie. My nerves and patience at that point were already at razor's edge. A special appearance by Kylie Minogue as 'The Green Fairy' in a 'Tinkerbell'-type role was the final straw for me.I shifted myself to the next room to work on the computer and for the next two hours, all I heard was non-stop 'yahooing' and music that resembled the sound a tin bucket would make after it was kicked down an endless flight of stairs. Towards the end, I was wondering aloud, "Please! Make the hurting stop!" The two other people I live with had already secretly exited the living room behind my back to escape the noise.I know that Nicole Kidman's main professional talent is targeted mainly towards acting. It is not a fair suggestion on my behalf to opine that she should work harder on the acting and leave the 'singing' thing alone altogether.I was very disappointed with this movie. For all the fabulous write-up it has been receiving from famous reviewers and everyday people like you and I, I was expecting a great deal more from "MOULIN ROUGE". I really REALLY wanted to like "MOULIN ROUGE", but I just couldn't get into it. Please don't accuse me of having a narrow mind because I am a very open-minded person when it comes to film projects. I am sure that Baz Luhrmann had a well-planned artistic dream when he put this film together. Unfortunately for me, it turned out to be one long nightmare. One reviewer on this web-site mentioned that they are "in love" with Moulin Rouge. I guess my motto would be, "I hate Moulin Rouge".My Rating: 1 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Massive Sensory Overload</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the strangest films I have ever seen. For one thing, it seems like a weird role for Nicole Kidman to take, not her kind of thing at all. The movie was like a bad acid trip: too many sounds, too many blinding bright colors, and too much camera movement, all assaulting the senses simultaneously. The musical style was from the wrong era for the historical time of the film: too modern for it, so it clashed. It reminded me of the country music I frequently hear at the Chinese buffets in my city. Combine that with a lack of plot, and you have a hideous caricature that attempts to imitate a movie and fails. Very bizarre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean I physically could not finish because the lightning fast editing was hurting my eyes and just making me dizzy. The camera switches scenes on average about every 1-2 seconds and I've got the beginnings of a headache to prove it. Never have I had a movie make me physically sick, but this one has managed to achieve that distinction and not just because of the editing.I can't say what the story is actually about because I couldn't discern that amidst the cluster of technicolor overload, ridiculously hyperbolic characters, and MTV music videos cinematography. Luhrmann tries too hard to be out of the box and winds up with a total mess here.I gave it 1 star for the effort and another star for the production. The costumes and staging are wonderful. At least I think they are. The camera moves so fast I'm not sure I actually saw what I saw. Suffice it to say I won't be going anywhere near this film EVER.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is all form and no content. Moulin is an MTV style music video at heart featuring good music, fast editing, color, costume, cartoon-like characters, and weak and dreamy love story. Moulin should have stayed true to its MTV genre and limited itself to 15 minutes in length.Beyond being a well produced music video the film failed miserably in every measure of a full-length feature. The story line was weak. There was no chemistry between Kidman and the male lead. This lifeless story is set amidst a backdrop of inane cartoon-like characters, and a twirling colorful headache of dancing and music. Extending the video format to more than 2 hours is a dismal failure. If I were distributing this film I would do the decent thing and include the following warning label on the marquee: "This film is dull and tormenting, proceed at own risk".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A waste of an evening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so incredibly disappointed. This was truly a waste of both my time and money, and an insult to the glorious movie musicals of the past. Not one original song--instead a long strain of every recycled old pop song you never want to hear again. And the vocalists certainly did not help the matter. Ewan McGregor, usually an excellent actor, suddenly loses all acting skills as soon as he opens his mouth to sing. (As to his vocal abilities, he certainly leaves much to be desired.) Kidman, though making a slightly better showing, was uninteresting and lacking in true vocal training, proving that it takes more than "star power" to have a vocal prowess that can carry a musical. Definitely not Kidman's best work. The story itself has potential, and the cinematography is unique and artistic...but the movie goes downhill from there. This is a devastating mess of a movie. If you're going to make a musical, for goodness sakes, PLEASE actually write an original musical score, and cast REAL SINGERS, not just "big names." Such a shame--done right, this movie could have been fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got this movie on DVD for Christmas from my older brother Paul, who basically doesn't understand me and never will. He more or less told me: 'I saw this with my girlfriend and we both agreed it was kinetic, it was energetic, it was musical and superficial. We immediately thought of you?' After seeing this atrocity, I have to seriously reconsider the image I project to my somewhat conservative family. "Moulin Rouge!" is the kind of film that makes you really consider with a jaundiced eye the sorry state of contemporary mass culture with desperate questions like 'Have we sunk so low?', 'Can we possibly survive?' and 'Don't we all deserve to die from shame for having had anything to do with the kind of society that can produce such a film and call it art?' I know it was produced by Australians and we should all cut them some slack for their relative lack of sophistication. I know Ms. Kidman gives a truly surprising performance as a dancer-singer (I thought she had no other talent than a certain ability to manipulate the media, which she shared with or possibly learned from her husband Tom Cruise) and I know it is probably supposed not to be taken at face value. But I can't forgive its pompousness, its grandiosity, its masquerading as something important while being such a patchwork of second-hand elements. It is supposed to infuse the viewer with the charm and cultural significance of turn-of-the-century Paris while paying homage to every French romantic creation from 'The Lady of the camelias' and 'Sc?nes de la vie de boh?me' onward. Yet, the only spoken French words in the whole show are 'Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?' from the Patti Labelle 'Lady Marmalade' song, which has nothing whatsoever to do with Paris, Romanticism or French culture. The plot is a distillation of every melodrama ever written down to its bare bones: Poor poet loves girl; girl belongs to rich man; girl spits out her lungs. And this is supposed to be funny? It's anachronistic, turgid, necrophiliac and excessive. It's a movie for people who think synchronized swimming is a life-affirming art. It's what Ren said to Stimpy about cartoons: 'They're only puppets and they'll rot your brains!' It's supposed to make you want to get up and dance. It only made me wish I knew someone intellectually-challenged enough to accept this DVD as a worthwhile gift. The truth about this movie is that it's one big monumental camp that was conceived for people who have no grasp of history, of the world they live in, of their own identity, of their own cultural heritage and who like dressing up in mother's mesh stockings and inventing stories in front of the mirror when there's no one around. It's really meant to bring out the secret drag queen in every viewer. Trouble is I never nurtured my inner drag queen. And I can only see this movie for what it really is: a desperate attempt at meaning from feeble minds and, now that Oscar time is approaching, a desperate grasp for Academy members' attention and the supplementary mazzoola that Oscar's prestige can still confer on this undercooked, overripe tripe."Moulin Rouge!" - the exclamation point is meant to express revulsion - is to movie musicals what "Family Guy" is to TV sitcoms: a cheap gimmick for retards, a cheat and an easy way out.</fullReview>

I'm not surprised that the MTV generation finds this compelling. It reminded me of nothing so much as the old Monkees' Saturday Morning TV show--except that the plot of Camille was thrown in and the action was speeded up. You could say, the Monkees on acid would be a fair description.The slapstick comedy was boring, the acting abysmal, the plot made no sense, the sets looked like a second rate Disney animated film. Let's see, take a compilation album commercial for pop love songs, add a Laurel &amp; Hardy Film, a high school production of Camille, the Blair Witch cameraman, "It's a small world" Disney Theme Park Ride, throw it in a blender, crank up the speed and add some acid.

		<shortDescription>Glorious Absynthe Prostitution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is crafted of many common narrative elements:--The rich cad versus the poor lad for the girl (with the conceit that love is unavailable to the wealthy 'unreal' class)--The girl who must renounce her love to save her lover (only to lose her own life)--The notion of players as prostitutes (here bohemian dadaists)--The setting of a play within a play (with the everpresent driver that the show must go on)--The extended bracketing (the opening/closing curtain, then the open/closing whiteface observer of the 'mill,' then the retrospective narrator writing what we see, then the initiation of the absinthe vision, all before the inner play -- and that inner play has yet another level: performers in an Indian court -- who are doing a song about a song)It also uses an ordinary convention of embedding songs in the action. Though one must note that absinthe hallucinations are intrinsically musical and similarly embedded. (Don't try this at home: thujone, the active ingredient in absinthe is so pernicious that is the only drug that has been successfully outlawed in the civil world. Think about that. Then imagine an absinthe bar on every corner and in every Parisian artist's life 100 years back.)Having mentioned all the ordinary elements, this film is the most fun I ever remember having in front of a screen. Everything to the smallest element is coordinated to be a single, transporting vision. And what a vision! The camera has character here -- it is a performer, it dances, laughs, cries -- it is detached voyeur, then intimate partner. Everything is so original in vision, and so coherent it amazes. This is close to scifi -- it conveys us to an alternative not-quite-real world we can barely reach.The actors play to a knowing camera-audience. There is an amazing sequence in the elephant when the Duke first interrupts the writer and the inner play's cast makes up and acts out the play in front of us. This of course includes self-reference of the current situation. We are so swept up in the exuberance that we lose our place. What layer where we in?(A talking sitar that can tell no lie? A narcoleptic Argentinian? The dadaist Latrec as the story's stable center? A connubial elephant? -- Glorious prostitution.)The layer shuffling happens again with a more edgy and sinister tone with a Tango to Sting overlain with other music and emotions: the 'real' action with Satine and the Duke. We lose our detachment again because the layers of self-reference are juggled. The finale echos this.Nicole does the best job of her career. She is so totally open here one worries for her -- I suppose this is the Emily Watson effect.Baz is now among my top three directors. This is a near perfect film in execution. The one flaw comes from that perfection. Broadbent is a perfect Zidler. But he has played this same role before -- recently, and in a similarly nested play: 'Topsy Turvey'. It takes a small chip away from the originality if the film.See this. See it twice in a row, the second time for the absinthe, and allow yourself to be ravished deeper than you knew you existed visually.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Rouge!, A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The bad commercial campaigns of the best movie of all time failed to give Moulin Rouge! worldwide recognition, but alas, this happens with many great movies (e.g. Requiem For A Dream, Donnie Darko). The whole comparison between this and the new musical blockbuster Chicago is useless since they are both great movies but not the same. Still, Moulin Rouge! remains in the first place on the Best Movies list. This musical, comical, dramatical and action packed hell of a movie will satisfy the whole audience. It just needs to be given a chance. Never have I seen an audience stand up and clap, with tears in their eyes, at the magnificent movie they have watched. The story is very simple but very complicated at the same time, giving enough music, action and laughs for everybody's taste. The characters are very easy to relate to and the edge-of-your-seat directing gives edge to this masterpiece. Christian, a young writer arrives in Paris, against the will of his father, to seek a career as a writer. He meets a group of bohemians who are planning to set up a musical play at the famous club Moulin Rouge and they invite him to rewrite the story of their play but at the same time to lure the famous courtesan Satine as to star in their play. Satine confuses Christian with the Duke, who on the contrary is expected to sleep with Satine to finance the upcoming play. The confusion continues and finally Satine and Christian convince the Duke to accept to finance the play. As the play is made, Christian and Satine fall in love, but the Duke's rights to the play also count for the body of Satine. She is his. And so the lovers try to keep their love a secret before everything is lost. On the way, jealousy, betrayal and trust is needed for their love to be contained. Satine is portrayed by the beautiful Nicole Kidman who delivers an astonishing performance. Her character has so much life inside her which makes you fall in love with her. Nicole was truly the one for Satine, for her beauty and character match like no other. She did, in fact, break two ribs during the making of Moulin Rouge! Ewan McGregor, one of the finest young actors on the Hollywood A-List, plays the writer Christian with success. Christian is a three-dimensional character with feelings and compassion. Both of these excellent actors' singing and dancing skills help in the portrayal of their characters.  The direction is simply amazing. With the best director there is, what can someone expect? Baz Luhrmann shows us his creative and brilliant ideas through his direction, cinematography, editing and camera work. All of these factors give you a dazzling effect. The editing gives you enough to be kept at the edge of your seat and also to feel those small goosebumps running up and down your back. The music is absolutely fantastic. The idea of mixing old songs together and forming this huge masterpiece is just amazing. The original music created by Craig Armstrong, one of the finest, also has atmosphere and is truly brilliant.  Mr. Luhrmann also takes us comprehend the importance of the visual world of movies with Moulin Rouge! The whole movie is a visual attack, giving you enough colours to come back begging for more. It dazzles you amazingly and twists you around. The costumes are excellent and the sets are simply fantastic. The mixture of all of these given to you by the editing will leave you speechless and coming back to watch it over and over again. Moulin Rouge! is a movie for the people. It has something everyone can relate to. It has been an instant classic ever since it came out in the cinemas. The more you watch Moulin Rouge!, the more you get addicted to it and the songs can even make you sing along. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor show off their acting and singing capabilities and at the same time director Baz Luhrmann mixes them together and forms his finest masterpiece up to date. Moulin Rouge! makes you proud for who you are and will make you fall in love with it. This is a movie about Truth, Beauty, Freedom and above all thing, Love...Savvas Stavrou's Rating: 10/10 - A True Masterpiece</fullReview>

It's touching at one time, funny at another....Firstly, the music is GREAT - there are the likes of David Bowie, Rufus Wainwright, Beck, Alka Yagnik... even just listening to the soundtrack CD alone is an ultimate emotional ride enough. Visually, the cinematography, costumes, sets, and choreography are just stunning. They work great as a whole and resulting in a dramatic eye candy.

		<fullReview>'Moulin Rouge!' is, without doubt, one of the ten worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching. It's loud, annoying and senseless with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.Though it's billed as a 'musical', most of the music is drowned out by sheer noise. And the musical directors cast historical accuracy to the wind as we hear contemporary songs including 'Lady Marmalade' and 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend' performing in Paris of the 1890s(?)! What schlock!As much as I usually love Nicole Kidman, even she could not salvage this awful movie for me. A Golden Globe ... !?! C'mon. Nicole should have won a Globe and an Oscar for her performance in 'Dead Calm', but certainly not for this unadulterated mess. The acting ... by everyone on-screen ... is so irritatingly hammy that it cries out for brown sugar sauce. Yuk!What were they thinking!?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Campy Piece of Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Am I the only one who felt that this movie just was campy garbage. I mean granted, I have to give credit where it is due, The cinematography was different and grand, the singing of Ewen McGregor and Nicole Kidman was quality, however I felt that the Bastardization by Luhrman of the great Rock and Roll works probably made Freddy Mercury and Kurt Cobain roll over in their graves. I really felt that the predictable plot and the campy dance routines made me want to laugh in a bad way more than praise the movie. If this is the type of movie that people believe is brilliant, I believe that a new Paulie Shore movie is coming out for you intellectuals. After seeing this movie, I have lost all respect for Baz Luhrmann's "artwork". I mean, he should leave the writing to someone else, and just direct a film as although this film was nominated for best picture, I think it is truly worthy of being nominated for worst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A love-it-or-hate-it experience. I hated it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw MOULIN ROUGE! the other night on Netflix and I thought it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Completely self-indulgent, contrived, soulless, and pretentious. And yet people keep calling it one of the greatest movie musicals ever. It's literally all style and no substance.There were many things about this movie that annoyed me so I'll try and keep it to a minimum.1) The plot: I've never seen a romance in a movie that felt so fake as in MOULIN ROUGE. Kidman and Gregor have no chemistry on screen but to be fair that's probably more of the director's fault then theirs. They keep saying crap like "love will shine through" or "love will conquer all" or the popular "the greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love and be loved in return." Give me a break. I literally counted how many times they said "love" in this movie and it was 126 times. (Although I may have lost count during the Madonna number when the chorus sings "Love!" a dozen times every 5 seconds.) The love that this movie babbles on about isn't real love. It's formulaic, planned, polished, and fraudulent Hollywood romance. The relationship between the writer and actress never felt true because whenever their relationship was in danger, it was because the one-dimensional Duke threatened, never the two in love. That Duke only exists to the convenience of the plot. Real problems in a relationship come from the lovers like their personalities, life choices, etc. There's more to love than just pure romance. It's about getting past problems and working through them instead of just waiting around and doing nothing hoping that "love will conquer all" in some clichéd climax. There are better romance films out there (musical and non) that actually show real love like CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND, CABARET, LOST IN TRANSLATION, and more.2) The characters: These people seemed so non-existent. In fact, the characters in this movie weren't characters; they were set pieces that could move around, sing badly, and make stupid faces at the camera. There are great actors in this movie like Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman, and Jim Broadbent; yet, director Baz Luhrman favored their costumes and bedrooms more than their acting. A real shame and a real waste of potential.3) The editing: Based purely on this aspect, I believe MOULIN ROUGE! was made for people with severe ADD. Not one shot lasted more than 3 seconds. All it is is just people mugging at the camera as it zooms from one room to the next. It's as if Luhrman is afraid that the actors will distract from the movie's style so he yells CUT!! right before the actors summon a real emotion. Characters should never be upstaged by the visuals; the visuals are there to add to them and the story. Ironically, this MTV-style approach actually hurts the movie's look because we can never get a good look at the amazing art direction. These sets are fantastic! Let us see them! 4) The music: My friends kept telling me how brilliant and innovative the soundtrack is and when I saw the trailer I thought I was going to adore it. But when the McGregor character first sang "The Hills are alive with the Sound of Music!", I groaned thinking to myself, "Great, it's a jukebox musical." For those who don't know, a jukebox musical is a musical that uses already existing music for its "score." It's damaging Broadway right now with shows like American IDIOT and preventing musicals to move forward artistically. It should be used as an homage to great composers and their work, but nowadays it's just a cheap move to enhance album purchases. I guess in MOULIN ROUGE it's supposed to show how love is universal in all kinds of music but it makes the movie seem anachronistic. Plus, if a movie like MOULIN ROUGE is going to have this much hype around it, it better have original songs. Some people say "Come What May" is the only original piece but I've done some research and it apparently was used for Luhrman's previous film, ROMEO+JULIET. It wasn't even written specifically for MOULIN ROUGE. (It's an awful song anyway.) I can't stand it when people praise this soundtrack because there's nothing really brilliant about simply rearranging and orchestrating existing pop songs and having them sung horribly. (Kidman is not a singer! Why is she used in this and NINE?!) 5) The directing: Pretty much everything I've complained about is because of Luhrman's direction. People wonder why he never got an Oscar nomination for Best Director. It's because he didn't care about the story or characters, only the sets and costumes. It's actually kind of amazing how much he didn't care. There's no sense of pace, subtlety, or consistency. There's nothing wrong with trying to make your movie look spectacular. But if your story and characters fall flat, then the images just become something nice to look at and dissolve from the audience's memories once the movie's over. There's got to be something else that gives the film its drive other than clothes, art direction, and choppy editing.Well, that's all I can think of for now. Hopefully I didn't rant too much. Obviously I'm in the minority but that won't change my opinion. But who knows? Maybe I'm just "missing something." I just wish people would acknowledge and admire real musicals instead of a collection of pop songs pretending to be musicals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I walked out on this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am an artist, photographer, costume designer and love most anything French... but I hated this movie. I saw a preview in Vogue of the costumes and eagerly awaited the film, but was dreadfully disappointed in it. I walked out about half-way through, as I was feeling dizzy and sick from the incessant flash-and-dash editing, and the utter silliness of it. There isn't one scene that lasted long enough for my eyes to focus on it. The mix of songs, some stolen from other musicals, were staged in a blend of people and animation, and are awful. Though I was surprised to find that Nicole can really sing, while her costar cannot.The story is taken from the real life of an actual French dancer, but what is in reality a tragedy of life cut short is here made into a comic travesty. It's a different style film than others before it, but different doesn't mean better. I give it two thumbs down. Skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And so I went, journeying into the unforgettable trip that was "Moulin Rouge!" - now and forever one of my all-time favourite MOVIES (not just movie musicals) ever! I simply cannot say enough to express how very deeply this film affected me when I first viewed it...it's impossible. From the very first jaw-dropping image of the 20th-Century Fox logo bordered by a beautiful red velvet curtain and a bouncy conductor - I knew then that I was about to experience something I had never seen before. Grand, inspiring, original, flawless...everything that so many others have said in their descriptions of "Moulin Rouge!" could not be put any better. This is the reason I am now a bona-fide fan of director Baz Luhrmann. I had actually seen some of his previous work - the hyperkinetic modern version of William Shakespeare's "Romeo &amp; Juliet" - and from then on was absolutely hooked onto his visual flair. Likewise with "R+J", "Moulin Rouge!" oozes with theatrical energy, gorgeous costumes/set designs, terrific music, and of course, first-rate acting from its wonderful two leads, as well as the supporting cast.Watching the first few minutes, I could unfortunately see why this movie was ignored and laughed at by many critics, filmgoers, etc.; apparently it developed a bit of a "cult" following of sorts after that. I agree that it's not for everybody - but come on, after I finished it, I remember thinking: "What's wrong with everybody? This movie is a classic! What were the haters thinking?" Granted, if you don't like musicals, I can understand, but for others, I guess its overwhelming originality and unconventional wisdoms were too much for some people. Oh, well...you clearly can't please everybody.At any rate, this film deserved all the praise and award nominations it received and/or won. It's certainly one of the more interesting and groundbreaking films released early in the new millennium, and it truly reminds some of us just why we love movies in the first place (or musicals, or MOVIE musicals, for that matter). It lifts our spirits with often-campy fun. It's lovely, it's larger-than-life, and it's just plain phenomenal. A joy to watch and listen to.I'll stop gushing for now...I think I've made my point clear. Thank you.* * * TRUTH * BEAUTY * FREEDOM * LOVE * * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like Titanic, this was one of those movies that female friends had suggested was good, but that I intended to go to my grave having not seen. However, someone put it on at a little get-together, so rather than be completely neurotic and leave, I stayed to watch.God how I regret it.That's two hours of my life I want back. The only good points I could pick out were that the sets (when you could see them) and the costumes. Both seemed quite well done. Actually, if you removed the script and the cinematography, I suppose it wouldn't be such a bad movie. But those two ruined it for me. The camera angles were so jerky and uncoordinated I felt sick, and the plot was incredibly bizarre and didn't make sense until at least half way through. And the final nail in the coffin that would make me recommend this movie only to people I hate is that they used SOUND EFFECTS for the characters' movements. Seriously, cartoon sound effects.Want a historical semi-funny romance? Get Shakespeare in Love. Want to be sickened by bad camera angles, nauseated by the neurotic acting, and just plain irritated by the general reek? Then by all means, I wholeheartedly recommend Moulin Rouge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I lasted about 50 minutes in this movie until Jim Broadbent's leering ginger mug repulsed me so much I had to leave. There is no denying the beauty of the art direction here, but it really is the proverbial purse made from a sow's ear. The script is appalling, the plot paper thin. In the grand tradition of all those terrible puppet shows your parents made you sit through when you were a child, there are characters who exist for no reason other than to add a sort of aural punctuation to the main characters songs and sentences. John Leguizamo's entire dialogue seems to consist of beeps and squeaks at appropriate moments. Then there are the songs...ah yes...the songs. If you want to shake things up a bit and "re-invent" genres, which Luhrman is no doubt trying to do, is dull radio fodder like Elton John really the way to go? The choice of such songs smacked of product placement. Beyond this, add the fact that Ewan Mcgregor cannot sing, Kidman's voice was flat, and both of them gave up trying to act before the movie had even begun, and you have an undeniably excruciating experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I must be missing something here!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 2001 when 'Moulin Rouge' was released, the reviews did not tempt me to see it and subsequently I forgot about it. I recently bought a copy of the DVD on impulse; assuming that it must be a re-make of John Huston's very fine 1952 film of the same name which was primarily a biography of the artist Toulouse-Lautrec. On playing it I found Baz Luhrmann's modernistic musical, which played like an extended music video rather than a coherent film. It had little appeal to me, and my first reaction was to rate it for IMDb at 1 star. One look at the ratings chart showed that this would be an extreme and unreasonable reaction to my disappointment (which was after all my own fault). Most ratings charts show a good approximation to a Gaussian distribution about whatever peak the film is judged to deserve, but here there is the perfect bi-polar distribution showing separate peaks at 1 star and 10 stars - clearly this is a film viewers either love or hate. Comments from database users who rated it at one star mostly felt, like I had, that it had nothing in common with what they expected from a good feature film and they therefore had nothing good to say about it; but those who rated it at ten were about seven times as numerous, and enthusiastically accepted what Luhrmann provided - however unexpected - as providing stimulating and rewarding viewing. With such an unconventional format, Luhrmann himself is probably more than happy to find seven viewers in tune with his presentation for every one who rejected it, and I had to acknowledge that my reaction perhaps resulted more from my limited tastes than from the film itself. User comments are presumably intended to concentrate on the qualities of the work concerned as assessed by the writer, and should as far as possible filter out idiosyncrasies of taste even when this is not easy to do. Generally when rating a film I like to consider three things - is it well constructed?, has it been created as the producer &amp; director envisaged? and does it leave the viewer with something to think about when leaving the cinema? (The latter of course is not an essential as many films are only designed to give a weary viewer 90 minutes of complete relaxation - but I would never feel that such films should be rated higher than eight ) Re-attempting a fair evaluation on this basis, I still found myself unable to award Moulin Rouge more than a very generous four stars.The Moulin Rouge is now an almost legendary institution. Any film named after it has to show why it has had such an ongoing appeal for so many years. One wit said that visiting it is something every young man wants to do, unfortunately he often can't until he is too old to still enjoy it. It is this aspect of a sensuously seductive but often inaccessible haven for young men that should first be brought out in any film. The smoky atmosphere in which Toulouse-Lautrec spent night after night sketching a variety of entertainers who could just be seen through the haze was never brought out as it should have been (and was in John Huston's 1952 film). Instead we have clear sharp images swirling and blending in mostly brilliant lighting, as in a kaleidoscope. The incredibly rapid sequencing of visually incompatible images was extremely tiring to watch and for me contributed nothing to the story. The modern pop music continually jarred with the scenario of a building that is so closely associated with the elegance of the 1890's. The continual blending of not only different songs but totally different styles of music left me tired and breathless. The story of entertainers who are manipulated, in a way which often destroys their personal lives, by the impresarios and backers who are anxious to wring another few cents out of the production, is a very old and hackneyed one, but it could have still worked if the characters had been much more rounded and the audience had been able to feel more closely involved with them. This was quite impossible here.When writing a paragraph such as that above I normally feel I have reviewed the film in a way that should be helpful to at least some other movie-goers, but in this case I am left wondering whether I have only reviewed myself as a movie fan. Even in a situation where I cannot enjoy a particular film I can normally understand why other viewers with different tastes may do so. Here we have a situation where I can appreciate the elegance with which Moulin Rouge has been created, the story it tells, and the brilliance of individual sequences, but the way in which these sequences have been combined, and the totally inappropriateness of the sound track for the mood of the film, make it incomprehensible to me that the film could be given more than a low to mid-range rating by any viewer. Perhaps I have reached a point where I can no longer communicate effectively with a significant proportion of today's movie fans.My advice to readers is that those who can enjoy watching music videos continuously for an hour or more might love this film, anyone else should consider staying away. But, either way, do not watch this film to experience the magnetic attraction that the Moulin Rouge exerted in the Paris entertainment district for such a long period of time. Instead try to find a copy of the 1952 film of the same name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The single worst movie ever made, and for good reason: none of the plot was original, at all. You want a dying courtesan caught in a love triangle? Try the opera Madama Butterfly, or the hit musical Miss Saigon. You want a heroine dying of consumption in a bohemian atmosphere in Paris? There's this opera called La Boheme I highly recommend. The cabaret singer who falls for the poor writer? Watch the movie/musical Cabaret. The entrepreneur who toys with the affections of his starlet? The black-and-white classic Twentieth Century with John Barrymore will suffice. And not only is it the most derivative movie ever made, the acting was ridiculously bad. Ewan McGregor's crying when Nicole Kidman died actually made me laugh out loud. Sounded more like he was struggling with a hairball. And Kidman can't touch Liza Minelli as the singer in Cabaret. That this pitiful excuse for a movie is even considered to be in Oscar competition with such a staggering, incredible cinematic achievement as Lord of the Rings is a travesty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a mess! Director Baz Luhrmann takes every known cinematic gimmick, tosses them all into a food processor, and splatters the mixture all over the screen like a would-be Jackson Pollock. It's loud, brash, colorful, relentless, and doesn't make a lick of sense. The result is a musical that seems to take place at no particular time, and in no (despite the name) particular place. There's nothing here that even remotely evokes either Paris or credibility, and character development is nonexistent. Ewan McGregor meets Nicole Kidman, mutters a few Bernie Taupin lyrics to her, and she immediately declares that she's "in love." Uh, right. The next 100 minutes consists of various characters engaging in routine and stereotypical melodrama, singing bits and pieces of twentieth century pop songs to one another with songs rarely being sung in their entirety. The "Like a Virgin" sequence rivals the "Officer Krupke" sequence from "West Side Story" as perhaps the worst three minutes ever presented in a musical film. The conclusion of the story is totally unmoving, since you don't know the main characters well enough to care about them. When it's over, you just sit there wondering why you paid good money to be visually and aurally assaulted for 126 minutes. On the plus side, Luhrmann's use of color is impressive. Kidman looks absolutely radiant, and she and McGregor both sing surprisingly well. The opening credits are quite clever. I'd have been tempted to give this film a rating of zero, but the film is so emotionally uninvolving that I just didn't care about it or any of its characters enough to hate it that much. 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suffocating the Movie Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Pearl Harbor would be the worst movie of the summer. Then I saw Moulin Rouge. Baz Luhrmann has indeed reached the core of human emotion. I never thought I could hate a movie this much. I can't recall the last time I laughed that much at a movie. And this one wasn't even a comedy.This might be the first musical with -- NO -- original songs, but that wasn't the bad part. It's what was done with the songs that was the killer. As if we're supposed to find tunes by Madonna, Queen, the Wallflowers, Sting, and others fitting in 1900 Paris... Anyway, I can get past that.I have to make a list of things I learned from this film1) Baz Luhrmann can only direct one movie. It's name is 'Romeo and Juliet'.2) If you're going to rip off a plotline, take it from a relatively unknown tale, like 'Pearl Harbor' did from the French legend of Martin Guerre. Don't take that of a critically acclaimed, amazingly popular film that won Best Picture three years ago.3) It seemed like an acid trip. It is not creativity, it is insanity.4) The movie musical has not been revived. Lurhmann, in performing CPR on it, blew way too much air into its lungs, thus making them explode.5) 'Phantom', 'Les Miz', 'Miss Saigon', and other stage muscials are believable. People cry at the end of 'Rent', when Roger confesses his love to Mimi. It is impossible to cry at a movie where the moon winks and smiles at the main characters.6) Did I mention the lack of an original plot?7) Any handgun, when thrown through a broken window in Paris, will travel several miles, out of Montmartre, over the city and off of the top of the shaft of the Eiffel Tower. (This of course, is much to the delight of Earth's only natural satellite.)8) Some movies scream "I DESERVE AN OSCAR", as this one does for costume design. It'll grab it, but please, let it take no others. If so, I've lost total faith in the Academy.Thank you for allowing my venting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorly Thought Out - Doesn't Even Work As A Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie - to me (and I know I differ with most others on this movie) - is precisely how NOT to make a musical. For one thing - did they have to use old songs? There was something odd about that, and how they used them, that, to me, made this the #1 corniest musical of all time. Could they not have hired a talented songwriter or team of songwriters to craft songs that actually pertained to the story? That would have been nice. The acting, too, is really clichéd. Even fine actors like Nicole Kidman come off badly here. Director Baz Luhrmann was going for some stylistic quirk that just made me want to gag. Poor acting is the result. The story line is SO hokey, too - and one that you've seen hundreds if not thousands of times. Nothing new here...it's SO predictable as to make you wonder: how much thought did writers Luhrmann and Pearce put into this thing? Like the reused songs from times past, this story is a retread of a retread. I am shocked anyone thought this was anything but a boring sappy work of an inferior mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An experience you won't forget, spoilers included.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film I couldn't stand it. It was just to unrealistic, with the characters breaking into song at every given opportunity it was just to hard to get involved in the film &amp; actually believe that it was real life. A few years after I first saw the film I sat down &amp; watched it again. This time I loved it. I know many people who can't stand the film &amp; would never watch it again, I know many others who adore it &amp; watch it again &amp; again &amp; again. This is not one of those films that you like a little bit, this is one of those films that you either love or hate, but you have to watch it. This film is written, directed &amp; produced by Baz Luhrmann. Unlike other directors &amp; producers he uses different techniques to remind the viewer that this isn't real life it is just a story, in 'Moulin Rouge' the songs. These techniques are what make his films so distinctive; these techniques are what made me hate the film at first. Once you get used to his different style of film making, you can actually enjoy the film without getting too involved.The story is set in Paris in the late 1800's, Christian, played by Ewan McGregor, comes to the capital of Bohemian life, to live a penniless existence as a writer, much to his father's disappointment. Christian came to Paris to write a story about that which all bohemians believed in-truth, beauty, freedom &amp; love. Unfortunately for Christian though, he had never been in love. 'Luckily right at that moment an unconscious Argentinean fell through my roof, he was followed by a dwarf dressed as a nun?' From here onwards the story develops. Christian goes on to write a musical play to be performed at the Moulin Rouge, the most famous underworld club in Paris. When at the club, Christian meets the chief courtesan of the Moulin Rouge-Satine, played by Nicole Kidman. He falls head over heels in love with her &amp; eventually she falls for him too. The clubs owner Harold Ziddler, played by Jim Broadbent, persuades a wealthy Duke, played by Richard Roxburgh, to donate some money to the club, but only on the condition that Satine becomes his wife. This story develops into a crazy love triangle, it's unpredictable from start to finish but will Christian have his happy ever after? The story starts &amp; ends with Christian narrating it, he has written his story, his story is the book he has been longing to write for so long, the film tells his story &amp; the story of his writing his story.Ewan McGregor &amp; Nicole Kidman work well together &amp; in fact the most remarkable part of the whole film is probably that all of their songs were actually sung by them. The others actors credit the film &amp; fit the characters perfectly, the only criticism I would give is a slightly pointless scene featuring Kylie Minogue. A heart-warming story with the main theme 'the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love &amp; be loved in return'. A story of a love that will never end, no matter what obstacles stand in its way. A film that will have you in fits of laughter one minute &amp; floods of tears the next. A guaranteed tearjerker, with a great soundtrack, talented actors &amp; actresses &amp; a good storyline. Love it or hate it, it's an experience you won't forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel keenly that "Hollywood" seems no longer able to produce ANYTHING on screen that can reach the discerning public. This film -- was it a film?? or a video-taped hopeful for broadway?? -- the "singing" was just so -- just so flat, loud, and emotionless, reminding one of a b-grade and copycat off-broadway score ... and one should not even mention that it was totally out of era (don't tell the kids - they'll believe anything we show them at this point) ... I thought this film (movie seems a better word) gross and disgusting in every sense. I worry some that we had to allow Nicole Kidman a flaunt of her assets on screen just before and during her much hyped divorce from whats-his-name. Along with the recent throw up of a re-made Pearl Harbor, (see Tora, Tora, Tora for a much better propagandic rendition), I feel most strongly about avoiding anything that is made in the hills of hollywood at this point. If they are worried about revenue, they won't be seeing my money for years to come -- dreadful stuff. Look to cable and the independents, and don't forget about the Brits and Europe for what is really counting on film. I think the US film (movie?) society has lost all its "brains" to the dot.coms at this point. Disgraceful .......</fullReview>

Hopefully they didn't spend too much on costumes, as the camera changed so fast the eye could not focus on anything. After 25 minutes of this I started to time the camera changes ( just shows how it held my attention) At this time they changed on average of 2.3 seconds. The opening number was much faster, probably 100 different shots in 38 seconds. If they are nominated for anything it should be for the poor sap that had to splice all those tiny bits of film together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Visuals, Terrible &amp; Insulting Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of the 1952 film, I was pumped to see this, especially after reading a few reviews which raved about it. Wow, what a letdown.Yes, part of the reason I was so disappointed with this was that it bore little resemblance to biography of artist Toulouse-Lautrec which was the centerpiece of the classic film. Later, when I was informed that this movie was not intended to be a re-make but a totally new movie with its own story, I felt a little better and watched the movie again. Sorry, but it still sucked!Oh, the visuals were great, especially in the beginning of the movie. I loved all the color and wild visuals in that first 20 minutes, but that was it. After that, it settled into a frustrating love story and the bogged down drastically the rest of the way.As for the music, there are too many slow numbers sung by mediocre singers like Nicole Kidman and Ethan Hawke, the two romantic interests in the film. They weren't bad singers, but so-so wasn't good enough for a major motion picture production like this.And, being a big fan of Toulouse-Lautrec's artwork and fascinating history, I didn't appreciate him being shown as a clownish transvestite-type character. That was disgusting, and really tells you about this film.As they say, "too bad; this could have been so much better." All they needed was an entirely new script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film has ADD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The easiest way to describe this film is that this movie has Attention Deficit Disorder and only very rarely does it take its ritolin. And when it does slow down, the movie still isn't good. Most of the film is comprised of meaningless cuts at an extremely rapid pace so that things are not on the screen for more than half a second. And this just hurt my eyes. Especially because the colors are vibrant and really leap out. Its like watching a music video which is already too fast on fast forward.When the film is not going off at this crazy pace, it is then comprised of extreme close-ups. The camera is so close on peoples faces that most of the time they do not even fit on the screen. And for some of the people, like the owner of Moulin Rouge, it is way too close and down right scary. A problem that I have heard most people had with the movie, if they had a problem with it, was the music. And that was one of the few tolerable things with it. Unlike the absolutely ridiculous music of A Knight's Tale, this music is incorporated into the movie well. At least here they make it like the music is original, even though it isn't. Don't get me wrong, I didn't enjoy the music, but its at least tolerable.There is not much good about this film. The story is 100% unoriginal and the film hurts your eyes. The tagline says that Club Moulin Rouge is an experience you will never forget. And that's true, Club Moulin Rouge is an experience you will never forget, but not because it was good, but because you will get ADD from watching it.</fullReview>

This movie is a caricature of modern life and the worldview of those who are brain-dead materialists. If you want to get my attention and keep it, you better have 1.) heart and 2.) brains. Moulin Rouge has neither. I would not call Moulin rouge a musical. I would consider it an attempt at extreme exaggeration by someone knowledgeable in conformity, illusion and hypnosis.

		<fullReview>I rented Moulin Rouge because I thought my wife would enjoy it. I was planning on just surviving the ordeal. As it turned out, I absolutely loved it. It is an artistic masterpiece. The plot was secondary to me and not to be judged at face value like plots in 30,000 other films. This was eye and ear candy, entertainment per se. I am amazed at how many reviewers absolutely hated this film. If ROUGE were judged by the plot, it is an awful and simplistic movie. But it isn't about the plot and it is a fine and sophisticated movie. The music is delicious and creative and played with a sense of humor, the songs of the 70's and 80's sung in anachronistic sarcasm and beauty. The leading actors were good-looking without being too old or too young and smug.  The craft of directing and producing is generally overrated. Any nit-wit actor with a lot of clout and money can become one. For once we see a film that is so complex in its art form and brilliantly conceived and executed that the run of the mill actor turned director could not have pulled it off in his or her wildest dreams. I hated to return MOULIN ROUGE to the store and may actually buy it on dvd. However I don't want to watch all the behind the scenes features. I want to always enjoy it in its pure form. The sets,(especially the model of Paris) are wonderful. Hoo-ray for this movie! By the way, I really enjoyed reading the people who rip it to shreds on the IMDB. What a subjective industry!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A trifling, insignificant little film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You're not going to believe this, but the film I was most strongly reminded of when I watched "Moulin Rouge" was "Mission: Impossible 2". Both Baz Luhrmann and John Woo have developed a very recognizeable visual style, and both of them are perfectly willing to tear a script to shreds in order to maximize the visual effect of their films. Each film is an empty, dessicated husk of a motion picture, lacking any real content or substnace at all. Both are pleasant to look at and, if one's standards are sufficiently low, passably entertaining. The fact that one is an action movie and one a musical seems a very minor difference to me.The plot of "Moulin Rouge" is both hackneyed and bad, which is a disasterous combination. But then, this is a musical, intended for a musical audience. A musical audience is one for whom singing and dancing are more important than plot and story. Similarly, M:I2 is an action movie, intended for an action movie audience, for whom chases, fights, and explosions are more important than plot and story.And what's all this bellyaching about the film being overlooked for Best Director and Best Editing awards by the Academy? The editing was a significant drawback to the film. The pace was so frenetic that it was impossible to develop any sort of emotional attachment to any of the characters. The direction was extremely clumsy. Check out my review of "Apocalypse Now," the bit at the end where I talk about Brando's performance. Coppola pointed a camera at Brando and filmed a great actor at work. Now, there's no Brando in this movie, but the cast is very talented. It is not necessary to provide a few seconds of menacing slow motion when Zidler orders Satine to stop seeing Christian, because Broadbent is a talented actor (who has finally been recognized, hooray!) who is perfectly capable of delivering the line with all the menace you need. Coppola is a genius and Luhrmann is hack precisely because Coppola knows what his job is, and Luhrmann doesn't.Luhrmann constantly uses the camera, the editing, or some distracting special-effects shot to unnecessarily underscore points that the actors are perfectly capable of making themselves. Compare to Oliver Stone, whose own ingenious editing style has been harshly attacked by many critics and filmgoers. In "Any Given Sunday", Stone uses editing to allow characters to clearly convey multiple emotions simultaneously. Pacino delivers a line laced with nostalgia and regret, while an image of Pacino screaming in rage appears silently on the screen. Stone uses his camera to give the audience information in addition to what the actor is giving. Luhrmann uses it to give the audience the same information, only without subtlety or grace.Basically, take "Shakespeare in Love", get rid of the wit, dumb-it-down a bit, throw in spectacular sets and costumes (credit where due), sing some anachronistic songs (which was sacrilege in "A Knight's Tale" but somehow genius here... go figure), and there you are. "Moulin Rouge".Many say you either love this film or hate it. I obviously don't love it, but I don't hate it either. There's nothing there to hate. There's nothing there at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a colossal disappointment for me. I enjoyed Romeo + Juliet tremendously and I really like Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, so this seemed like a can't miss.Unfortunately you could dive feet first into a puddle of this movie and not even get your socks wet. All the dialogue was contrived to find meaningful poetic snippets of great songs and compile them into one fluid love story. The idea has merit, but the execution was all wrong. The lines didn't tie together well and totally lacked the emotion of the songs themselves. This left little to no character development and almost no emotional attachments which should be important to a "tragic love story." Another problem I have is that a lot of the mystery is taken away in the opening monologue, not that that would be enough to wreck a movie, but in this case, there is no reason for it. So with the ending already decided you look to the actors to hold your interest and find yourself being even further let down. You hope the dialogue can at least carry some interest but that dies quickly too. I can't believe the hype for this movie, but then, I can't believe Britney Spears has sold millions of albums either. You can't trust the general public.The filming, set-design and costumes are the only reason this film received any stars at all in my book. Brilliant colors, multiple crazy angles/cuts and wild sets however weren't enough to hold any interest.I describe this movie as being liked by people that THINK they're artistic and creative but truly have no depth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The favorable reviews (by paid critics in the International Press) for this piece of drek (though I have no objection if it cops a Blue Ribbon as Best Of Breed at Crufts and/or the Kennel Club) illustrate to a fare thee well a social phenomena: Critics Are Getting Younger. It seems that the average critic today is a failed busboy/girl at Denny's and/or Burger King/MacDonalds who figured that filing copy was better than stacking shelves at Safeway. The major qualification seems to be 'sure, I'm qualified, I've seen 102 slasher' movies and/or 'I've seen Nightmare On Elm Street 36 times'. These cats have little or no frame of reference to guide them, if they HAVE actually heard of 'Citizen Kane' they think it's about that son of Adam who killed his brother and went to live in the Land of Nod. Their idea of in-depth movie analysis is Premiere. If they'd actually seen, say, Renoir's 'French Can Can' or Huston's 'Moulin Rouge' (both covering loosely the same subject) let alone even HEARD of either, they may not have been so hasty at garlanding this bad joke. What beats me is WHY anyone would want to make a movie set in a Definite period and then, deliberately GRAFT onto it the style/music of a later era. In 1953 Cole Porter wrote his penultimate Broadway Show, 'Can Can' and to do so he PAINSTAKINGLY fashioned a score that was redolent of French Music Hall at the turn of the 19th Century. Sure, he employed sophistication and wit but without drawing attention to them. The number in THIS movie that drew all the notices is 'Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend', a very sophisticated lyric (by Leo Robin) set to an equally sophisticated melody (by Jule Styne) but VERY MUCH in the style of the late 1940s, when it was written. In 1899 the music to be heard in Paris was the same as in London or New York. Mostly Viennese waltzes or two-steps, simple - if sometimes haunting - melodies and even simpler lyrics. The people who crawled out from under a rock to write and direct this travesty, to say nothing of those who cut it with a pair of secataurs, give the impression they have been walking upright only since Tuesday and have absolutely no concept of what cinema is all about. The same kind of people who think that 'new' automatically means 'better'. Minus 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Movies in One: All of them Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Moulin Rouge is a theater in Paris known for its elaborate and and somewhat racy shows, now a favorite for tourists visiting the city (I myself have fallen into that category). With all of the media attention bestowed on this project because of Nicole Kidman, and the fact that this was a musical, I was curious to see how it had turned out (plus my girlfriend wanted to go).The film begins quite promisingly, with an elaborate computer generation of Paris in 1899, including some whimsical touches, showing very interestingly the area of Paris in which the Moulin Rouge ("Red Windmill" in English) is found. I was reminded immediately of Tim Burton's work, with the attention to detail, and slightly surrealistic atmosphere; (I was also reminded of Disney's "Mary Poppins" with its rooftops of London scenes). This alone makes the movie worth seeing (well, almost).The movie starts out cheerfully, and somewhat goofily, in a good natured way, to introduce the protagonist, an aspiring writer on sojourn from London. When he begins to sing "The Hills are Alive (With the Sound of Music)" as suggested lyrics for a show on which his bohemian upstairs neighbors are laboring to produce for the proprietor the Moulin Rouge, the movie takes a turn into what I thought was parody, but sadly, was a harbinger of what to expect for the next two hours.Nicole Kidman is a prostitute employed by the moulin Rouge as a singer, but she refers to herself (and her occupation) by the more noble sound epithet of "courtesan". This may elevate in some way her status in the film, but unfortunately for her, it does nothing to help her singing, which is generally on the level of a medium sized high school musical. Editing techniques vary from styles lifted directly from the (very) old 1960's TV show The Monkees" to the frenetic MTV music video genre. All of this is pasted onto a very tired old plot about star-crossed lovers and a buffoonish wealthy rival for Miss Kidman's affections. Anachronistic uses of modern songs become jarring, like some Saturday Night Live skit that drags on and on; (some in the audience laughed heartily, blissfully unaware that it wasn't supposed to be funny).By the film's end, it is nothing more than a poorly scored and overbloated opera, or Shakespearean tragedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DISCLAIMER: I walked out after 25 minutes so this is what I thought of what I saw and why I left.First off all the editing was too quick made me dizzy because I couldn't focus on one shot long enough to take everything in. I wanted to see all of the beautiful details but never got a chance. The sets, make-up and costumes were amazing, but again, I wanted the pace to be a bit slower. The music was wonderful and I especially liked the use of contemporary songs. What I couldn't stand was that I felt everyone was overacting. I know that was somewhat the point, but the overacting was overacted. I thought Kidman did a decent job as Satine but her character was just so ridiculous I couldn't help but wince at every line. And everyone elses lines too. I left right after her introduction to the Duke. So did my three other friends. This reminded me of when I walked out of "Dick Tracy". Oh well. I did manage to go to another theater and see Bridget Jones...thank God for multiplexes!!!</fullReview>

I'm surprised to see the title "composer" in the credits. I didn't hear a single original note in the entire movie. Some of the lyrics were changed, yes, but in that respect the film only succeeds in being Weird Al Yankovic on REALLY bad psychedelic drugs. If the plot weren't so weak and cliche, perhaps it might have redeemed the film a little, but no such luck. A total waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chanteuse in late 1890s Paris mistakes a Bohemian songwriter for a wealthy Duke; they fall in love anyway. Strictly as a piece of eye-candy, "Moulin Rouge!" is a stunning cinematic achievement; alas, it is also full of inappropriate music and characters so manic they lose any appeal the actors might have brought to the slim material. It is visually inventive but absolutely devoid of passion, and so mechanically cranked-up to grab you by the eyeballs that it fails to come together on an emotional level. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor--everyone in the cast, in fact--is game and energetic to a fault, but after 90 minutes I'd had enough. The film's major conceit (pop and rock songs injected into a period setting) never quite gels, and as for the characters...who cares? *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The term 'style over substance' was invented for this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Moulin Rouge!" is a film filled with glorious sets, vibrant colors, well choreographed dance and music sequences, memorable costumes, and an active atmosphere. Unfortunately, the same care that goes into the style of the film does not go into the romance or the plot. It can be fun to look at, but it is not fun when you are actually looking for something beyond the look of the film.The scenes are rich and festive, filled with a lot of eye candy and glamorous colors to get your attention. A problem with this is that the film is shot so quickly that you do not have time to admire the visuals and are instead assaulted with quick shot after quick shot of them that does not allow you to take it all in.The movie is more interested in showing off its visuals than it is at giving the audience a story that the visuals can all fall back on. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is our run-of-the-line tragic poet who came to Paris against his father's wishes and believes strongly in things like love. After one brief meeting with the Moulin Rouge's star, a courtesan named Satine (Nicole Kidman), Christian is in love. While at first she is not in love with Christian, singing a few parts from present day songs a few scenes later makes her realize she is in love. Unfortunately for the two, Satine must sleep with the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) if she is to get out of the Moulin Rouge and become a real star. These events gives off one of the most clichéd love triangles of film history.By the end of the film, the plot of "Moulin Rouge" has gotten more out of hand than its visuals. The love triangle gets out of hand with nonsensical character motivations and the characters acting dumb. Christian and Satine plan to run off together because the Duke will not allow them to be together, but once she discovers she's dying they can't run off together for some reason. Before that happens, a background character with no reason to not want Christian and Satine together reveals their relationship to the Duke and torments Christian over the fact that Satine has to be with the Duke. By the end, the characters are out of this world, acting stupid, insane, or having sudden random motivations that make no sense."Moulin Rouge" is an assault on your eyes and ears, bombarding you with non-stop visuals and loud noises with very few quiet breaks in between to let what you've just watched sink in. The term 'style over substance' was invented for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally speaking, I don't like musicals. Mostly because of the songs. The two main exceptions are Singin' in the Rain and Grease, both of which are incredibly fun with very catchy songs. For the most part, though, I can't stand the genre, especially the recent flux of them of which this film is the catalyst. But, after hearing all the raves for this one, I decided to give it a go. It wasn't my type of movie, and I loved it.The interesting thing is, if this film hadn't been a musical, I doubt I would have liked it as much. Sure, the direction is innovative and the acting is impressive, but it's the numerous medleys of contemporary songs that really made this for me. Going in, I was under the impression that this was going to be like every other musical ? songs written directly for it. Little did I know that David Bowie, The Police, Queen, and even Nirvana were all represented in various shapes and forms. I absolutely loved the way in which a vast variety of songs were covered, interpreted, and woven together to create instantly memorable tunes. My favourite? Definitely "El Tango de Roxanne", but I enjoyed everything else as well.Of course, that's not the only highlight of the film. The incredible visual and directing style is unlike anything I've seen in a film of this sort before. In fact, it's really unmatched in cinema in general. The acting is very good, as the stars manage to create three-dimensional characters while also having great singing voices. The story is a brilliant mishmash of doomed romance, slapstick comedy, and even historical drama. The slapstick routine at the beginning crackles with terrific comic energy, and the whole film is incredibly vivid and alive.I have to say this is one of the biggest surprises for me as a moviegoer. A musical romance, two of my least favourite genres, that produced a hit song which I loathe, and I ended up loving the film. Go figure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Satine is a performer in the Notorious Moulin Rouge of 19th Century Paris. She performs on the stage, and for people with enough money, in bed too.But she falls in love with a penniless poet. Ummm...well that is the plot. Oh wait, I forget an evil duke.Baz Luhrmann, the crazy Aussie director, takes this simple plot and proceeds to hit the audience over the head with enough camera cuts, visual style and just plan Bazisms so that you are forced into feeling everything the characters feel in a way no other film maker does.Often I feel that Baz never has enough confidence to trust the audience to take the journey with him, but what what he does, only he does.From the first moment you are dragged into an amazing cinematic world where you should turn your brain off. This is not because the movie is stupid but because Baz and his film making team are going to do the thinking and feeling for you.Unique and amazing this movie uses things we are familiar with to transport us into a world that we don't really understand. A world where the can can is a notorious dance (actually women wore split crotch panties when they did this dance) and the electric light bulb was a modern wonder (people went to Moulin Rouge just to see this technological marvel...or so they told their wives).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mouling Rogue! is, at this moment, best movie that Baz Luhrmann has made. Romeo+Juliet was visually very similar, but it did lack the continuity of Moulin Rgue!. Whole fairy tale like feeling of the story makes this movie more enjoyable to watch.I am not huge fan of musicals, but I must confess that I adore Moulin Rogue. It has much to do with familiar songs that have been rearranged to fit in the musical pieces of the story. Many who have seen this movie pick out the wonderful tango version of The Police son Roxanne, but my personal favorites are wonderful adaptation of Madonna's Like A virgin and Queen's Show Must go On. But there are many others as well, whole movie is a fireworks of visual and musical candy.Whole movie is filled with fantastic actors. Ewan Mcgregor does mans work as Christian, a romantic, who fells in love radiant Moulin Rogue courtesan Satine, played Nicole Kidman, who has never looked more stunning. Richard Roxburgh as the Duke is wonderfully sleazy and disgusting villain, bringing great contrast against naive Christian.I could go on and on. It is hard to find bad performance from this movie.Enough is enough. You either love it or hate it. Go see it and decide. I love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Divided Reactions to Moulin Rouge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ratings posted on IMDb for Moulin Rouge are something of a surprise. People I know loved or hated this film in about equal numbers. And I mean REALLY loved or REALLY hated. If the pattern on IMDb were the same as the one I found among friends, there would have been clusters in the 8-10 and 1-3 range and very little in between. For those looking for guidance, you need to understand that everything about Moulin Rouge is exaggerated. You can go with the flow and enjoy the film (as I did) or you can compare it to more conventional movie musicals and despise it. For those who liked the movie, the lead review on this site has it exactly right. But you can also turn the comments around, view them from the other end, and understand why a lot of people disliked everything about the film for pretty much the same set of reasons. I can't really think of another movie ever that inspired such different reactions based on identical factors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, first of all it needs to be said that "Moulin Rouge" is a very strange movie and that there's a good chance it will confuse a lot of people. It's not like any other musical I've ever seen. On the scale of all things strange, it's like "Jesus Christ Superstar" times three. Intrigued? Yeah? Well so was I. So, I did some research and discovered that Baz Luhrmann's movie is actually a combination of three completely different musicals: "La Boh?me", "La Traviata" and "Orpheus in the Underworld" smashed together and then mixed with a truly bizarre combination of modern musical stylings and twisted pop-culture. The results are anywhere from hilarious (Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit") to very touching (Elton John's "Your Song"). At first, I wanted to start my review of "Moulin Rouge" by saying how I didn't understand how Luhrmann and Co. came up with the idea to make this film, but now that I think about it, it's really pretty obvious. It's very natural for filmmakers to want to make an "updated" version of an old play or an old film. They're doing it every single day. Now, making a new version work? That's the hard part. "Moulin Rouge" works because instead of shaping itself for its audience, it asks its viewers to shape themselves for the movie, thus pulling them into a strange and colorful world where anything can happen. It's loud and it's incredibly ambitious, but director/writer Baz Luhrmann juggles all of the movies themes very carefully. Every character is well established and well written.The film's tagline: "No Laws. No Limits. One Rule. Never Fall In Love" is pitch-perfect because it describes perfectly the conflict of the film. That is: what are the consequences of falling in love with a person who sells their body? Now, that's really under-analyzing the film. It's about a lot more than that: Death, sex, love, etc., but maybe that's a good place to start if you want to understand the plight of the characters in the film. The best sequence in the entire movie, a dance number featuring a Rouge prostitute and an employee that shifts focus into a sexual confrontation between the evil "Duke" character and Nicole Kidman's "Satine", really explores these central themes."Moulin Rouge" is the kind of movie that will divide people. But, I believe that most of the complaints that I've heard from the other camp about the film are simply ill-founded. The most common complaint that I've heard is that the movie is too "bombastic" in its imagery and that Luhrmann places too much emphasis on "style" over "substance". First of all, the expression "style over substance" is probably the most trite and cliché expression in the history of film, so it should not be used. (That's for you, guy on the IMDb forum). However, the basis for that argument is not very good either. "Moulin Rouge" does not feature its tremendously elaborate dance numbers simply to show off the talent of the director (though he definitely could do that). Naysayers argue that Luhrmann's movie is drowning in its own excess, but what they don't see is that THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. He wants us to see the trashy and elaborate life of the people that live and work in the Moulin Rouge club and after all, this IS a musical right? My vote: 8 / 10</fullReview>

The story runs so smoothly that I have no idea what time was it until the movie ended and I took a look at my watch.Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor's great voices really brightened up the movie. The songs were so great that I didn't realize it took place back in 1900s. Costumes were so great. I have no doubt it won Oscar for best costume.All sorts of emotions could be expressed via wonderful songs.

I think that Nicole Kidman is really impressive and I was surprised by her fascinating voice when singing. The rhythm of the movie is frenetic and the scene of the 'can can' is 'spectacular spectacular'. For me it is the story of the most impressive love match since Romeo and Juliet, and the tragic end instantly brings to mind the story of the Lovers of Verona. The real highlight among the well-known songs in the film occurs when a duet is performed By Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. In fact, I much prefer Ewan's version of Elton John's "Your Song." I always liked it but now I love it. I went out of the cinema enthralled and I have seen the DVD loads of times. It is the perfect movie to see in good company, and to cry with emotion.</fullReview>

She had the voice and the ability to act the part! Also, she and Ewan made a cute couple in the film.

Since Nicole Kidman split with Tom Cruise she's become such a charismatic actress! Great. And she can actually sing! You really have to give this movie some credit, though I must still confess that it is not my favourite type of movies. The soundtrack is amazing, by the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, I thought it was an okay movie with some good music...but after a while, it grew on me! It is about a young writer who falls in love with a 'dancer' in a club called Moulin Rouge. They go through many tough things because they can't be together. This is a good movie with some good music! If you saw the movie, and liked the music, i reccomend that you go and buy the soundtrack!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this on DVD with my boyfriend, it was rather a case of not being able to agree on any other to rent. To be honest by the time we got home I was starting to think I would have a bath and wash my hair instead.Gosh my hair can go dirty. This film was Fab, Terrific, Super Duper. At 40something years of age I was laughing and crying at a musical the worrying thing is so was my boyfriend.I dont know where to start, it was visually sensational, the music was Fab. We were delighted each time another song came along that we knew (must buy the sound track), the casting fantastic, direction superb it even had a good story......well ok it was one big fantasy that I was happy to be taken into and given an emotional ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw Moulin Rouge! last spring, I agreed with the nay-sayers. I thought the camera work was a bit too jarring, the story was too melo-dramatic, the choice of songs was inappropriate, etc. However, I rented the movie last night, and all of my misconceptions were extinguished. This is a spectacular, spectacular film! We are bombarded with uber-realism in today's cinema. Moulin Rouge! offers an entertaining vacation from the normal filmic experience. Moulin Rouge!concerns itself more with its artistic vision rather than the tired popularity contest of most studio films. Luhrman's original style and the sheer talent of the cast (McGregor, Kidman, Broadbent, and more) prove that the musical genre is not dead and, more so, that it can be extremely enjoyable to watch. So if you didn't like Moulin Rouge! the first time, I urge you to see it again with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a complex movie made out of a simple, unfortunately sad, story. I think that transforming a basic boy-meets-girl-falls-in-love-and-one-of-them-dies plot into a masterpiece is the work of a genius, but you can't expect less from Baz Luhrmann, now can you? Ok Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor aren't exactly Julie Andrews and Frank Sinatra but the bottom line is that they gave wonderful performances, despite the singing, and they had a real chemistry between them, which is something you don't get everyday. This is the kind of movie that goes to the extremes. Either you love it or you hate it. But most important, this is a movie about love. Since nobody really understands love, don't try to understand Moulin Rouge, just feel it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I totally agree with Rob, from NY. My girlfriend is from Spain. She thinks with these simple universal love stories they distill love to the bone and create an a new original version of an age old idea. The film is a work of art because it really does take you on a journey and if you fail to be taken in by this story then you are a cold hearted cynic and shame on you. This is what love should be and hardly ever is. Life is never like this but at least for a couple of hours we can believe it and love it. If you love your partner take her/him to see this film. If they don't come out loving you intensely, then dump them. It's true. Believe me. My favourite bit is Like a virgin with the aristocratic lothario and the Moulin Rouge impresario. My girlfriend's favourite bit is the dialogue/song battle using all the songs you've ever heard of in a seamless medley of intense pleasure: love versus convenience and who's paying the rent. Ultimately it's a fable but hey, it's fun and let's us all forget the drudgery of normal life for a moment. And if they actually had the final production/theatre piece on stage anywhere in the world in real life it would be sold out forever, forget Les Mis or other such rubbish, this was exciting and vivid - and I HATE musicals. Except Grease of course. What can I say, forget the US cynic critics and follow your heart. At least for once. Some people say you love this film or hate it. Maybe it's whether you get it or not. I hope you get it. Maybe it's because I have loved and been loved in return I love this movie but hope others can follow this path. Remember kids, there IS nothing else to life apart from Love. Don't forget it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was prepared to enjoy this movie, and I wound up hating it. None of the expensive fx, scenery, or interesting characters were given any screen time. There was nothing to take in and gasp at, as much as the director wanted you to go "ooh" and "ahh" - how could you when everything you want to see flies by with so many jumpcuts and camera angles that the only things you are left to see clearly are all the pores on the main characters' faces in interminably long, badly sung scenes? This was one long boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl again, boy gets girl again and how many more times is this going to go on and so on and so on in mind-numbing tedium.I started imagining, while watching this movie, how it would have been much better on a Broadway stage, replete with real singers, real dancers, real choreography and imaginative and beautiful set designs.. or even as a movie with a different director that would allow the viewer to be involved in more of the visual fantasy than just how much pancake makeup Nicole and Ewan were wearing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. No, granted, my favorite genre of film is not the abstract form of cinema this movie is created around. Yet, for the life of me I do not understand how ANYONE could like this movie. Exactly who is this movie geared towards? Children? Definetely not. I made the mistake, with this being a PG-13 movie, of bringing my 13 year old cousin to see this and it was, well, quite racy. While no one undressed there are several racy references, a scene where an orgasim is faked, an entire sequence, dance sequence that is, where 90% of the shots focus on the womens panties, and a whole lot of croch grabbing. Not something for the family.Is it for the older generation? Not likely. The opening sequence has Nirvana's "Entertain Us" sung by the Moulin Rouge faithful and the entire film is filled with songs most peoples grandmothers and grandfathers would not know or would not like. Plus, some wonderful songs, like "All You Need Is Love", an historic song by a historic group, was used as filler, and killed by two adequate singers who tried to sing the song in an old style musical format. HORRIBLE!!!!!!Is it for the younger generation? Well, from some of the posts I guess this is the group going. However, this younger generation may have a few who want to see a Pseudo-musical, since real musicals actually have original music, and some may want to seem artisticly adept by saying they like this film, but most young people, my generation that is,will more than likely stay away. The editing of this movie is horrible, the way it tries to combine the innocence of most of the older musicals with some modern sexuality gets to be confusing and disgusting, the editing is terrible as the style of the film changes drastically right in the middle, and the acting is horrible. Did anyone believe that Nicole Kidman would choose Ewan MGregor after the way he sniveled and whined throughout the film? It is preposterous and so badly done no wonder musicals are no longer made. DON'T ENCOURAGE THESE PEOPLE!!!!!! STAY HOME AND SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!! The more money this movie makes the more movies like this will be made. Hollywood already makes 6 bad movies for every one good one. Lets try and make sure that the bad ones at least stay away from bad singing as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One scene in this movie sums up the entire experience of "Moulin Rouge": The gleeful throng gathered at the Moulin Rouge/nightclub dances frenetically to a techno beat and breaks out into a chorus from Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit", "Here we are now/Entertain us." Kurt Cobain had something like this in mind when he wrote that song. Today's audiences would flock to see any piece of crap that is promoted. Not only that, they will eat it up and call it ice cream.I'm not sure if Baz Luhrman made this movie deliberately to raise this rather intriguing issue or if this is simply the worst movie ever made. At times it feels as if he's poking fun at the indulgent, extravagant excess that is today's pop culture or if he is a part of it. Maybe it's both. I found this ambiguity interesting and watched the entire movie, even though half the audience walked out during the first twenty minutes. If anything, the positive comments on this board prove that people today will put up with anything to be entertained. See this movie and judge for yourself.</fullReview>

After I bought it, I watched it at least 12 times(no exaggeration) and now any time someone says something that came from the movie, I finish the scene out in my mind or under my breathe! It is my all time favorite movie and I think every household(with children over the age of 13) should own a copy! Ewan McGregor became my favorite actor(and crush of all times...bigger than Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp!) and I think he played the part of Christian perfectly. Nicole Kidman nailed the part of Satine and every movie I see now with her in it, all I see is Satine. The sets were amazing and the colors were crazy, making my eyes go nuts trying to find a solid image to focus on. Again, my praise to this film and those who worked on it.

		<fullReview>I am not a fan of musicals. I often avoid to see them at cinema, but sometimes I see them on DVD and regret my choice. There are many musicals that can be considered the best movies ever: The Blues Brothers, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Rocky Horror Picture Show to name a few.This is a beautiful musical, too, that can compete for quality with the above mentioned ones, even if I voted 9 for this (my favorite ones are perfection). First the music is great. It has so many famous songs rewritten to fit in the script. I was delighted especially by the "Like a virgin" scene and by "Show must go on" (I'm always touched when I hear this magnificent song. It tells a lot of life and death and can be considered the most impressive testament by Freddy Mercury. One of my favorite songs ever). The initial song (I knew a boy..) is also very touching.So, the music is great, the script is funny and well written, the direction is wonderful, the actors are great, Nicole is sexy and as good as usual. But Jim Broadbent (the owner of mouline rouge) is the best actor in the play. He creates a character that you cannot easily forget.Don't miss this movie in DVD. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Literally the worst film I have ever seen, no redeeming qualities whatsoever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is simply head-achingly, gut-churningly, fingernail-curlingly bad. It was so horrible it made my hair hurt. The previous night I had watched Inspector Gadget and decided it was the worst film I'd ever seen. Then I watched Moulin Rouge and had to instantly change my opinion. Everything that was horrendous about Inspector Gadget is equally true of Moulin Rouge, plus much more besides.I can't believe this film was nominated for awards, I actually feel sick after watching it and created an IMDb account purely so I could rate it 1 out of 10 and write this review in an attempt to exorcise the demons. Literally the worst thing I've ever seen.The plot, the characterizations, the dialogue, the musical butchery, the cinematography, the sound effects, the acting, the lighting.. every single aspect of film-making that went into Moulin Rouge was just excruciating. I feel like the guy in The Crying Game, when he's crouched in the shower trying to scrub away the pain.I genuinely cannot express the sheer awfulness of this film, I am traumatised by it. I cannot understand how a single human being could possibly feel anything but contempt for this monstrosity.Bad, bad, bad to the point of being evil</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that dazzling would be the best word to describe this film. Everything about it is just visually pleasing from the set designs to the beautiful costumes. The idea of adding unique flare to classic songs (i.e. "Heroes") really made me adore all of the musical numbers. For the most part, the charisma and eccentric nature of the film was hilarious and a joy to watch. However there were certain points, mostly in the first half, that were a little bit too out there for me to enjoy and ended up distracting me from the film as a whole. A lot of the film was really cheeky and sometimes that worked, but sometimes it turned me off. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman both give absolutely phenomenal performances (the best I've seen from both of them), doing an outstanding job of combining emotional range with drama, musical talent and very charismatic charm. I loved watching them throughout. The story has been done many times before, but it felt really fresh for some reason, maybe that had to do with the overwhelming charisma. I can't get over how fun it was to watch McGregor. Overall, I liked it a lot more than I thought I would and it's certainly one of the best of 2001.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gosh! I loved that Ewan and Niccy did their own singing and dancing in this. I just love reality and musicals! Especially reality in musicals. Anywho, for those of your not familiar with the tale of Devdas that I mentioned in my summary, well, Devdas is a sort of Bengali Indian story of Romeo and Juliet but it's completely original because it draws from true life. Boy and girl love each other but are driven apart by forces within their surroundings. Moulin Rouge is sort of like it as well, with the all star cast to boot. I mean, we're talking stellar director Baz Luhrman, actors Nicole Kidman, Ewan Mcgregor, Jim Broadbent, John Leguiziamo, singer Kylie Minogue among others. The film, about two star crossed lovers is as lush and as lavish as any epic Bollywood piece. Don't miss the stirring ballad 'Come what may' sung by Kidman and Mcgregor, and that infectious Lady Marmalade end credits/Grammy winning soundtrack song that caused the likes of Christina Aguilera, Mya, Little Kim, and Pink to come together for that party! Kidman is the most famous Moulin Rouge performer and Mcgregor is the writer who falls for her, too bad the theatre funder who Kidman is being forced to pretend she is interested in also has plans for her. Match that with tuberculosis in a day and age where it was untreatable and you know this can't end well. One of my sister's actually thought that all that coughing from Kidman's character was a result of her corset being too tight. LOL! Nice movie though, one of my favourites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'La Traviata' on absinthe: a dazzling triumph of old-fashioned heart &amp; Bollywood colour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see 'Moulin Rouge' with high expectations: I was not disappointed. On a big screen, in a traditional 'red curtain' cinema, it enveloped me in colour, music, dancing and dazzling visual fantasy. I laughed, I cried, I went out and bought the soundtrack!The plot is simple: 'La Dame aux Camélias', with added vitality from a colourful crew of comic supporting players. Behind the modernity of the visual effects and use of familiar pop songs in the soundtrack (each prompting a delighted gasp or laugh of recognition from my friends and myself), this is an old-fashioned musical with a warm, uncynical heart. It's just over 2 hours of romantic escapism - which we all need a shot of, from time to time.Our ingénu hero Christian (Ewan McGregor) arrives in Paris, fleeing his strict father, to become a writer. With echoes of 'La Boh?me', he falls in with a motley crew of bohemians, or rather, *they* fall in on him. Literally. Through the ceiling. In an attempt to obtain financial backing for his friends' new play, he falls in love with the beautiful and ambitious cabaret singer and courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman). Their romance is threatened by the scheming Duc de Monroth (pronounce it French-style - and remember 'Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend'!), who holds the deeds of the Moulin Rouge as security on gaining Satine's favours. But a still greater danger is lurking, as Satine begins to suffer fainting fits and cough blood when she comes off stage...Where Baz Luhrmann and his team have worked wonders is in revitalising the musical - a genre which has been fading in the West - by looking to the East, to Bollywood, where it has never died. 'Moulin Rouge' is essentially a westernised Bollywood film, blending comedy and tragedy with stunning visual style and lively song-and-dance numbers. The climactic scene from the Indian-themed show Christian has written, 'Spectacular Spectacular!' acknowledges the film's key stylistic influence.Meanwhile, Christian's public humiliation of Satine, hurling money at her feet, is straight from the original Dumas novel. The carpet of scattered red and white petals which surround the lovers at the tragic end - long anticipated, but still heart-wrenching when it comes - are surely a nod to Marguerite Gautier's camellias. If the modernity of approach has jarred some ears, well, a previous, less humorous musical version had similar problems in the 1850s: but Verdi's 'La Traviata' nevertheless has been a great hit ever since!There are also nods to other influences: the Méli?s-inspired 'magic lantern slide' vistas of Paris, lit by a smiling, singing moon; and 'La Fée Verte' - Kylie Minogue's red-eyed Absinthe Fairy - zipping over the city and illuminating it with her wand in a cheeky parody of the Disney version of Tinker Bell!The songs have been used effectively, to advance the story and illuminate character. 'El Tango de Roxanne' is a particularly striking piece, underscoring the tensions and jealousies when Satine is on the point of sacrificing herself to the Duc. The 'Elephant Love Medley' is delightful - funny and romantic, while 'On with the Show' makes the most of the dramatic power inherent in so many 'Queen' songs. And I will never hear 'Like a Virgin' again without thinking of its use as a comedy number by the endearing Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler...!'Moulin Rouge' is an enchanting way to spend an evening. It glitters and shimmers like Art Nouveau favrile glass. The costumes, sets, photography and choreography deserve every award going! I can see this film becoming a standard Christmas classic when it reaches TV, or becoming a cult movie, with sing-along audiences dressing up as the characters. Certainly joining in with boos, cheers, and laughs is an essential part of the fun! To be watched with a shot of 'Green Fairy' close at hand! I cannot wait to see what Baz Luhrmann - the cinematic 'Wizard of Oz' - will do next!</fullReview>

The concept of constructing a story based on lyrics of popular songs has potential, but is undermined by inept direction and editing. Luhrmann is a clueless hack better suited to making MTV videos than a feature film. This is the perfect film for those suffering from attention deficit disorder. The editing is so frantic that few shots last more than a second. The incessant cutting and zooming is nauseating. The plot is clichéd and melodramatic, capped by a ludicrous finale. On the plus side, McGregor brings energy to his role and Kidman has never looked more beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This must be the most overrated film I came across on IMDb yet. If you look at the user rating statistics, you can see that most people voted it 10. Also, can be seen the average rating for male voters is 7.5 (as of the day I write this review). This is clearly a film that is usually more appealing to female viewers, and why is it that if only males voted for this it would still get a great rating, is beyond me.This film is not only a total atrocity, but an opportunity missed to make a visually beautiful film with great songs and performances.I have to say I'm a male, but the reasons why I dislike this film is not because of that.The editing is absolutely terrible. CUT CUT CUT CUT CUT CUT. About 20 minutes in the film I started counting how often is there a cut (which is already a sign that I waited for the film to be over). There is a cut every 2-3 seconds in average. You barely can follow what is going on. You just see faces pop up on the screen. There is even a scene where you see the building of the Moulin Rouge for a second. It just pops up, you don't know why. That shows that the whole editing of this film is a mess. The director employed this quick editing for the movie to be stylish, but it just failed.The acting and the character development are disastrous. Nicole Kidman looks gorgeous as always, but that's it. Both her's and McGregor's acting is extremely forced and unnatural. Also, I don't see why I should care about the characters, if the director doesn't care about developing them. What we know about the two main characters is that they LOVE each other. Everything else is unimportant. The creators thought that the love and chemistry between McGregor's and Kidman's character will be so strong and powerful that it will blow us away, and then they can do ANYTHING on screen we won't notice. NO. You don't care if a plane crashes in the Moulin Rouge, and all the characters die, because you don't care about them.The visual style. A huge fail again. The whole thing tries to have it's own unique and beautiful visual style, but it just isn't impressing at all. The whole film seems like it's on a set, and maybe that was intentional, but in doesn't work anyway.Ridiculously clichéd dialogues and story. The word LOVE is used in every sentence, there are monologues about LOVE, Ewan McGregor is a troubled writer who LOVEd someone, and writes a story about LOVE, and the whole film is about LOVE, ....... NO, enough!The interesting thing is that all the points cited above have one thing in common (apart form that they are all negative). The quick cut-cut-cut editing, the forced and cheesy acting, the wanna look cool visual style, the 'they've done this story a hundred times before but I'll show that I'll do it the best' comes down to this: the director wants us to believe that this is great by those things. It wants to shows that this is a unique and powerful film. No, it's not. It's a bad bad bad film. Of course, it's got to be said that this is a musical, and you can still like the songs. If that is the case buy the soundtrack, but don't waste your time watching this atrocity. And the fact that it won 2 Oscars, shows the true quality of these awards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Moulin Rouge was spectacular!! The vibrant costumes, sets, and characters made the whole movie come alive in it's own sense. I was amazed to see two actors I'd never known could sing (Ewan McGreggor and Nicole Kidman) project such astounding voices! I loved all the little musical jokes in the movie like McGreggor belting out The Sound of Music to McGreggor and Kidman singing a wonderful medley of classic songs. I loved the conflicts and "close calls" that all of the characters faced in this movie. Baz Luhrman put a magnificent twist on a basic "love-triangle" plot, making it one of the most amazing, funny, tear-jerking movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A post-modern masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love &amp; be loved in return': so begins `Moulin Rouge' as penniless Parisien writer &amp; hopeless romantic Christian (McGregor) types &amp; reads out the story as it at the same time unfolds before us. `My writing was interrupted' (he types &amp; reads, &amp; I paraphrase) `when an unconcious Argentinian fell through the roof' (cue said precipitation) `and a dwarf dressed as a nun ran into the room' (which he did). Thus the scene is set for an audacious, dazzling, deconstructed &amp; reconstructed, exhilarating romp of a film: a romantic tragedy, a musical that is at the same time old &amp; new, as much an homage to times past as it is a herald of the 21st century.It turns out that the 2 intruders (Koman as the narcoleptic Argentinian &amp; Leguizamo as the painter Toulouse-Lautrec) were rehearsing a play called `Spectacular Spectacular' (itself a good description of the film, 1 of several play-within-a-play self-references), which Christian is promptly drafted in to rewrite. The play is to be shown at a can-can cabaret theatre, the `Moulin Rouge', where Christian meets &amp; falls in love with the star turn, lady of dubious virtue &amp; struggling wannabe Satine (Kidman). She's a ?Material Girl' who apparently will do anything for money &amp; for the furtherance of her career, &amp; who is attempting to seduce a rich Duke (Roxburgh) to that end. Christian attempts to turn her with nothing to offer but his undying love &amp; a beautiful singing voice. Can he save the girl &amp; win her heart from the cold evil Duke &amp; his money? Will love save the day? The outcome isn't hard to guess ? not least because it's announced in the opening scene ? but then it isn't meant to be; this is not your average run-of-the-mill movie. Visually this is absolutely stunning ? the sets &amp; costumes are impossibly colourful, lavish &amp; detailed, the choreography inspired. The cinematography textbook has been thrown out here; the camera seems to have a life of it's own, panning &amp; zooming manically, making a mockery of normal concepts of time &amp; space, &amp; giving us many post-modern sight gags along the way.The cast is superb: McGregor to my mind is one of the finest actors to emerge out of Britain in recent years, &amp; Kidman fully justifies her star billing. Broadbent, Roxburgh, Leguizamo &amp; Koman give excellent support with really strong performances, &amp; there's a great little cameo from Kylie Minogue as an ?Absinthe Fairy'. There are moments too of great theatrical power, chief of which to my mind (along with the climax) is the moment when Christian accidentally gives the game away to the Duke about his Hamletesque play-within-a-play; a really powerful scene. The film exudes an intoxicating energy from the opening scene to the stunning denouement, &amp; is in turns exciting, uplifting, inspiring, energising, clever, funny, surreal, &amp; profoundly moving. The music itself is superb, &amp; ranges from turn of the century vaudeville to Fat Boy Slim, Christina Aguilera &amp; the queens of hip-hop, stopping along the way for opera, Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein, Bollywood, The Beatles, T Rex, Bowie, Madonna, Nirvana, U2 &amp; Beck ? among many many others; the original music also is excellent. This is a music lover's paradise! Surpassing even the variety &amp; quantity of the music is how it is used: often completely disparate types of music are meshed together seamlessly in a way that is clever, witty, highly original &amp; simply exhilarating. For instance: a can-can type number sung by the Moulin Rouge cast alternates with the audience singing back lines from Nirvana's `Smells Like Teen Spirit': `here we are now, entertain us' etc.; Christian eventually wins over Satine in a conversation come musical duel comprised almost entirely of lines from pop songs ? brilliantly imaginative &amp; witty. The viewer is constantly surprised with the ever-changing musical landscape &amp; at a time when so many films are extremely predictable for this alone `Moulin Rouge' deserves high praise.The quality of the music is also outstanding, not in the least due to the vocal performances of the stars themselves. Kidman holds a tune extremely well &amp; combines beautifully with McGregor - who is simply magnificent. His is a voice of such control, range, power, tone &amp; expression that it is the equal of his considerable acting talent. His rendition of Elton John's `Your Song' is one of the most beautiful songs I have heard in a long time. Jim Broadbent, playing the theatre owner, adds his stentorian baritone, while Koman growls his way magnificently through a version of The Police's `Roxanne' ? in duet with McGregor &amp; a tango - that simply has to be heard to be believed. `Moulin Rouge' is a truly modern musical; Luhrman has taken hold of an old &amp; cliched genre, injected it knowingly with 21st Century irony, imbued it with great energy, imagination &amp; talent; &amp; has produced a post-modern masterpiece, one of the most audacious &amp; original films seen in a very long time - &amp; one for which he deserves every success. After all, to quote Christian &amp; Satine (&amp; Paul McCartney), `Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs ? and what's wrong with that, I'd like to know?', &amp; surely ?making love not war' has never been more appropriate than it is now. Love it or loath it - &amp; you're sure to do one or the other ? for any lover of film this is compulsory viewing.Me? I've fallen in love. RATING: 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this film first came out, I didn't hear much about it. Once Oscar season started, it seemed as if I had lived in a hole. Everyone was talking about this film. I still hadn't seen it, and the only thing it was to me was competition for my favorite of the year, "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring." However, about a month later, I finally saw the movie everyone had hailed for nearly a year. It seemed as if everyone I knew had seen and loved this film. I rented it, and from the first moment it started, I was entranced. Every moment of this film kept me hanging on, and sending me through a whirlwind of sights, sounds, and delights for every sensory part of my brain. I truly believe that this may be one of the greatest artistic films of ourtime. I've been accused of being an "artsy-fartsy" person, so maybe that's just the artistic side of me talking. But even if it is, there is not a single time when I have seen this movie that I have not been moved to tears, be it from the story or the beauty of the movie itself.First, let me address Ewan McGregor's performance. Regrettably, the only thing I had seen him in prior to this was, ahem, "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace." Imagine my surprise when the little Jedi belted out "Your Song," a favorite of mine, and promptly caused me to melt into a puddle of shapeless goo. I still swoon every time I hear his voice. Who knew Obi-Wan could sing, on top of act the part amazingly? Not I, certainly. Opposite him, I could have chosen no one better than the lovely and talented Nicole Kidman. Definitive Satine? YES. Simple as that. Her voice and her actions made me truly believe and love the character, even when she wasn't entirely lovable. John Leguizamo was simply superb as Toulouse-Lautrec, especially for someone who traipsed about on their knees throughout the entire film. I agree with many of Hollywood's best and brightest when they say that Jim Broadbent's Oscar this year was not only for "Iris," but for this film as well. Fatherly, comedic, and boss-like all at the same time, and managing to do it all with a large mustache and potbelly as well.One cannot mention the cast without mentioning the incomparable Richard Roxburgh and his incredibly hilarious yet amazingly imposing (at times) performance as the sinister Duke. Every singer, every dancer, every actor, every actress in this film was perfect. Not a single hair was out of place. Which leaves the director and magic maker himself, Baz Luhrmann. Not many modern directors would set out to do a project like this. Perhaps thirty years ago, but not now. This was probably the biggest risk in his (and everyone else that worked on it, too) career. Maybe the public is split down the middle, between those that love it and those that couldn't sit through twenty minutes of it, but this reviewer and movie viewer knows that this will go down in history as one of the greatest films of our time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had some expectation of a decent movie when I rented this but was still very disappointed. I shut it off after about a half hour as I could not follow the plot. There was Music and Singing but the actors were not good at musicals in my opinion. Couldn't they get real singers to play in the movie? The costumes and actions were busy and disconcerting and did not keep me hanging on long enough to see the movie through. Since this movie, I realized that Nicole Kidman's acting and/or movies are not worth watching. The only one I would recommend is the one where she lives in the haunted house. Next time producers would hopefully use singers to sing and actors to act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A screaming mess of an attempt to make a super modern musical/love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not like Moulin Rouge the first time I saw it and I realized why when I visited the exhibit in the Washington, DC National Gallery "Toulouse - Lautrec and Monmartre" last April and saw close to 200 paintings, posters, etchings, prints, and other works of one of the most original, ironic, and insightful painters ever.No one was able to capture Monmartre the way Toulouse-Lautrec did - its raucous spirit, unbridled energy, tawdry behavior, garish colors, and provocative celebrities. Lautrec's works are filled with the unique atmosphere of daring, racy Monmartre of the late 1890s. To make a film about Moulin Rouge which is inseparable from Monmarte and to present a stupid caricature, the ridiculous and pathetic marionette that (for some unknown to me reasons) was called Henry de Toulouse-Lautrec and to take away the mood, the atmosphere and substitute them with loud, senseless mess - was unforgivable. I bought a CD in the Museum shop with the original Moulin Rouge songs and music that were written during the "Belle Époque". Even though some of them sound a little funny and naive today, they are natural, they are not the fakes that were used in the movie and were supposed to represent the sound of Monmartre of the years long gone.Well, the DVD was on the shelf in the library where I volunteer every Saturday and I decided to give the movie the second chance. I should not have done it. I watched about 20 minutes, and that was all I could take. I remember from the first time that "Roxanne" was filmed well and I found and watched the scene again. I like the song and the dancing but I hated how they had to squeeze Kidman in there. The big part of me not accepting the movie is that I don't see Kidman's talent in this particular movie, I don't like her acting, and she irritated me most of the time. There are more things about "Moulin Rouge" that I don't like. I hate the story; I hate the stupid dialogs about "summer of love". Cancan is a very sexy dance and well performed it would take your breath away. Whatever they called cancan in the movie was not unlike the group of cows performed on the scene.What a screaming mess of an attempt to make a super modern musical/love story/whatever. This was my second time, and that's it.Time Magazine said, "You've never seen anything like it!" - Indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Moulin Rouge'is one of my favorite movies! It has so many great elements that I need to write them by parts. First of all,Ewan McGregor is fabulous, and if I remember correctly this movie was one of the movies he did that helped his career to be at the top as a big star.Even knowing that Nicole wears wig, I think she is in the top of her beauty as the red head Satine,and both Nicole and Ewan are great singing showing a surprising and beautiful voice. We have parodies of many famous songs of famous artists as Nirvana,Elton Jonh,Joe Cocker,Madonna,Queen,Phill Collins,David Bowie among others.We have spectacular scenarios,clothes,make up and visual effects in this movie as well as a beautiful and sad story of love. Everything perfect for a big hit.Ps:The Green Fairy played by Kylie Minogue is awesome. Ps2: Thanks to this movie, the hit ''Lady Marmalade'sang by Christina Aguilera,Pink,Lil'Kim and Mya became famous and a success.aka "Moulin Rouge- Amor em Vermelho" - Brazil</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love movies and I love good music and dancing. Unfortunately, my experience with Moulin Rouge was marred by the director and film editor. Flashing through different camera angles second by second in a herky-jerky fashion may work well for a short music video on MTV, but it had me feeling nauseous before this movie was half over. Not even Blair Witch Project gave me motion sickness like this. I would like to have seen the dancing with at least 5 seconds per camera angle because a lot of it looked like it may have been wonderful. The singing and the story were great, enjoyed all the more when I closed my eyes to settle my stomach. Kind of defeats the purpose of going to a movie theater. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>It must have been the fact that before this movie I watched the beautiful masterpiece that Chicago (2002) is! After having a great time watching one of the best musical movies I've seen, I was left wanting more so I went to my Netflix recommendations and saw Moulin Rouge. What a great mistake, Netflix! I'm pretty sure I didn't see more that 30 minutes of the movie as I ended up having a terrible headache and even wanted to vomit. I have never, ever stopped watching a movie after so little time. If something, I think this movie has the record of sickening me in the shortest amount of time.It's definitely not a good musical as the singing could not be appreciated because of all the horrible noise around it. Everything had me feeling dizzy and feeling embarrassed for the movie. A specially cringe-worthy scene was the one with the Tinkerbell like fairy doing this strange dancing and looking extremely fake. I've seen some people that also hated the movie say that at least the Art Direction was decent but I really couldn't see pass the bizarre camera effects. Well, I got to see the horrible make- up worn by the "Diamond girls" which were supposed to be the most beautiful women in all France. Well, I was extremely disappointed in that department.Still, I must admit that Lady Marmalade is one of the best pop songs I've ever heard and is a great collaboration between 2000's most successful pop ladies. I was left wanting to hear the whole song and watching a similar performance as the music video but they could even take good advantage of it.I don't recommend it at all. Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unsurprisingly disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen Australia and recently The Great Gatsby, being roped into watching Moulin Rouge by some friends was never going to make for an enjoyable night. I obviously don't get Luhrmann's whole aesthetic, his visual palette stretches further than is at all remotely pleasing, having no explicit colour scheme or feel. Taking mediocre modern pop songs and turning them into musical numbers and featuring a whole host of ridiculous sound effects the likes of which you might here in Lizzie McGuire leaves the whole film feeling a bit ridiculous. Don't get me wrong I understand it's meant to be ridiculous in a way, exaggerated and overdramatic but it's too much, it literally seems like a parody of itself at times. In a role I don't feel either of them suit, Ewan and Nicole gaze off into the distance, overact, dramatically sigh and batter eyelashes more times than I cared to count. Considering Christian and Satine's relationship was the focal point of the film, we never exactly learnt much about it. Maybe if less time was spent singing and more developing their characters this might have been different. I understand it's a musical but there's no need to recycle what is essentially the same scene, Christian serenades Satine at least three times, often using the same words and it gets a little bit - scratch that, a lot old. Baz loves, more than anything to unnecessarily use shitty CGI to illustrate that which could just as easily been naturally shot. Australia has some of the most naturally beautiful landscapes in the world, yet those were replaced with ridiculous, cliché copies in Australia. Leo DiCaprio was replaced, in the final scene of Gatsby, with an unrealistic 3d model when seen floating in a pool. Moulin Rouge features much of the same: horrible CGI, haphazardly intertwined with live footage, out of proportion and out of place. As far as positives go I can't name too many, although some of the scenes were very impressive and the "wow" factor managed to creep through on a few occasions. The story, though cliché and recycled, is a great one. Another saving grace was the humour, though musical and theatrical satire usually doesn't do much for me, there were a few laugh out loud moments. All around I was disappointed, though I expected no less, it was as cliché and over dramatic as I'd anticipated, 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The wife dragged me along to Moulin Rouge when it first hit the cinemas. I didn't want to go. It did not appeal to me in the slightest.And then it started with a little bloke with a baton at the front, giving it some wellie as the 20th Century Fox fanfare played. And I was hooked.The introductory sequence featured a creepy take on Nature Boy and some dazzling (and funny visuals), and I was so deeply into it that I am still recovering ten years later.This film tells a melodramatic and tragic story set in the Toulouse Lautrec era Moulin Rouge, and does so by mixing and matching a vast array of theatrical, cinematic, musical, visual and storytelling styles. The music is largely contemporary, often with assorted songs cut up and snippets sewn together, and delivered brilliantly by the cast, especially Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor (although I must award bonus points for Jim Broadbent delivering an eye-boggling, but plot-relevant, version of Like A Virgin).The visuals are imaginative and dazzling. Richard Roxburgh is a terrific funny and scary pantomime villain.I remember people walking out of the cinema during the movie, and I can quite understand them doing so - it is not to everyone's taste. But, in its outrageous fusion of elements which should not work together (but which do), it is a unique film of immense bravery. And, best of all, it is highly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Modern Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favorite musical, it's also a tragic love story and is at times very funny.An idealistic young writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) is wooed by the Bohemian lifestyle flourishing in Montmartre district of Paris where he falls in love with Satine (Nicole Kidman) a singer and courtesan at the famous nightclub Moulin Rouge. Along for the ride are Jim Broadbent (who would win an Oscar for Iris the same year) who plays Harold Zidler the club's manager, John Leguizamo as Toulouse-Lautrec and Richard Roxburgh as The Duke the couple's nemesis.Baz Luhrmann (Director, Writer, Producer) expressionistic vision is visually captivating and that combined with the film frenetic pace and wonderful use of contemporary music makes this a truly memorable experience.Strong performances from Kidman, McGregor, Broadbent and others but the exaggerated style and approach keeps these from being award winning roles though they are wonderful performances. In addition to their acting talents Kidman and McGregor are both worthy of praise for their singing talents, and Broadbent's single musical contribution is definitely memorable.Moulin Rouge was the third part of Luhrman's so called Red Curtain Trilogy, the first two parts being Strictly Ballroom and William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. The films share a creative team in addition to design and thematic elements though the stories and characters are not connected.The film was recognized throughout the world and nominated for 8 Oscars including Best Picture and would win two of them Costume Design and Set Decoration ? Art Direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is a movie which i had been planning to watch for many years now,from the day it released.I recently rented the two disc DVD edition of the movie and it was a wonderful musical indulgent. I admire musicals as they are just a joy to watch and moulin rouge delivers the best music of it times. All the songs are well crafted and performed,Nicole has performed close to 5 songs and so has even McGregor along with her for two songs. The Story as it claims is about freedom truth beauty and love(hope i got all four rite!) and yes it tries to capture them all together with Paris' very own Moulin Rouge in the background. The costume and stage set up is really awe inspiring and the make up for characters brings in the grandeur the director had in mind. The movie is a real treat to the eyes and also to the soul with all the love in the air.Catch this movie if u haven't,after all its "THE REVENGE OF THE MUSICALS" time now!</fullReview>

But the people this movie is for will surely be able to appreciate it fully.Moulin Rouge!: 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had so many preconceived notions about this movie, as is understandable, even for someone who doesn't watch television, when you're talking about a film that was hyped as much as this one and which has such a following. I didn't watch it until tonight because I was afraid I wouldn't like it. For the first twenty minutes or so I thought I was right, because *other* preconceived notions I had were being laid waste left and right, and that took some mental adjustment. Once I settled in, however, and got used to the stylized presentation I found myself more and more enjoying *Moulin Rouge* for what it was -- an amazing, well-put-together combination of lightheartedness (even silliness) and deep emotion. The music is wonderful (even, perhaps especially, the odd but fitting usage of modern songs). The singing is breathtaking. There are moments that made me laugh out loud and yet the end had me nearly in tears -- what a staggering range of emotion this movie encompasses. Every character was acted to perfection; I could go on for pages and not do justice, not only to Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, but also to the entire supporting cast. As I mentioned previously, the stylized production took some getting used to, but by mid-film I found it adding rather than detracting from my enjoyment, for the most part. Perhaps there were some devices (the jerky movements) which were irritating even until the end. The writing and direction overall are superb -- the whole-cast scenes as well as the more personal moments. This is a movie well worth watching; I'm glad I stuck it out past the first twenty minutes or so and let myself really get into it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Baz Luhrmann's previous works such as "William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet" but "Moulin Rouge", in my opinion, was perfect, I'd give it ten stars if I could. It was a magnificent and breathtaking film. Kidman was born to be Satine and Ewan McGregor actually CAN sing. The film was a bit too dramatic at times and the cinematography was incredible..."Moulin Rouge" should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Baz Luhrmann should have had an Oscar nomination.Some people criticized the cinematography for being too vibrant and colorful but that was the best feature of the movie. Normally, I do not care for musicals but this is more than 'just a musical'...it has elements of drama and comedy as well. Nicole Kidman was absolutely beautiful and she did a FANTASTIC job as Satine. "Moulin Rouge" was a large [array] of colors, music and the craziest, most gaudy sounds of music ever! The costumes fit the movie very well.The music was great too. It was cool to hear Nirvana, "Lady Marmalade", "Material Girl" and Marilyn Monroe's calling card all at once. I also liked Kylie Minogue as The Green Fairy/Tinkerbell. Bottom line: I love this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magical musical fantasy gone wild</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been warned about Moulin Rouge! by my friends a few years ago when they saw it in the theaters."So, this is what an acid trip must feel like!" was the exact quote...I beg to differ...Moulin Rouge! was a fantastic film in my eyes. Yes, it was VERY different and definately stuck out in the pool of films that came out in 2001.I applaud Baz Lurhman for his effort to create a magical musical that involves comedy, music, and a beautiful romance.Yes, this film was over the top but that is the point... it is not meant to be realistic... but entertaining. The colors, the music, the dancing, the sets... all of it are meant to bring the audience on a magical cinematic journey.Not every film is meant to please everyone. But for those who love musicals this is a must see. Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, John Leguizamo, and Jim Broadbent give amazing performances... it is a shame though that Ewan and John were not nominated for Oscars for their roles.This film is absolutely thrilling. I give it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i first saw this film on its initial release i was stunned at its energy and sheer visual accomplishment..now having watched it many many times..i still wish it would slow down at times as the rapid and spasmodic editing gets a little wearing at times..the tango scene..whilst powerful..is so quickly edited that you find it hard to see the dancing..and to feel the acting from both nicole and ewan..but only a few minor moans against an otherwise beautiful and unique film.Whilst Chicago has its merits by being rather "old school" musical in its presentation..Moulin Rouge is a musical on absinthe!..Fabulous performances all round..particularly Nicole Kidman..and Jim Broadbent.. it maybe an acquired taste as a film..but like absinthe..once tried never forgotten..one minor extra quip..note to baz luhrmann..as satine's signature song in the film is "one day i'll fly away"..why at the end of the film,didnt christian release satine's bird from its cage hanging outside his blacony!?..maybe im too soft..but the sight of that little bird..with nicoles's song gently playing beneath being released into the paris skyline at sunset would have made this already romantic old heart bawl my eyes!..just an idea..other than that..fab film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from the media coverage regarding it's Oscar nominations and successes, I had never seen Moulin Rouge until I bought the DVD. The surrealism of the opening titles and sequence was, for me, totally entrancing. I, at first, doubted the movie during the wild set piece which introduced all the main characters and, ultimately, the character of Satine. After that, I was entranced and fully enjoyed the rollercoaster ride of emotions. Call me old fashioned, but I watch movies as an entertainment and do not look for any hidden messages, mistakes or wish to comment on the director's 'vision'. As entertainment, Moulin Rouge is a visual and very emotional treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really fun film, with the adorable EWAN MCGREGOR!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can't compare Chicago to Moulin Rouge, because they share, really, nothing besides the fact that people sing and dance. Moulin Rouge stands alone. I really love this movie.Nicole Kidman did sorta over act in parts (the Elephant scene, and when she tells Zidler she wants to leave.), but other than that, the acting is wonderful. I just love Ewan McGregor's character, and I love Ewan McGregor. John Leguizamo's character, Henri Toulouse Lautrec (yes, the famous painter), I found was just such an annoyingly funny character, he was definently one of my favorite characters. The Duke (Richard Roxburgh) is definently overacted, and frankly, Zidler (John Broadbent), is sooooo horribly annoying, you really would want to throw yourself off the Moulin Rouge windmill.I love this movie. There are some funny parts, but they are mostly just in the beginning, and the best musical number isn't 'Diamonds', but rather, the dramatic 'Roxanne'. Another one of my favourite pieces is 'Nature Boy', the song sung at the very beginning. It's so sad, but very touching.The beginning is sort of depressing, but it doesn't last long, so don't stop the DVD then. The middle sort of drags on, so be warned. The sets and costumes are beautiful, and very colourful, and the dancing is really Spectacular Spectacular (excuse the pun...), but long periods of time with the Bohemians, or at the Moulin Rouge can make you feel like you're stuck in a circus tent. But since Ewan McGregor's in it, I give it 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent. Honest and sweet in a way few movies dare.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked some of the songs from the soundtrack and borrowed the DVD from a friend to see what the movie was like. Some would maintain that it's not a true musical in the sense of classics like Singin' In the Rain and West Side Story, and they're probably right, but that doesn't make it any less entertaining if you give it a chance. For all its pop-culture borrowing and frantic presentation it stays true to its message, simple though it is, and avoids descending into the tedious self-mockery and cynicism so common to many modern movies. It's really surprisingly sweet, honest, and moving. It may seem strange to say that a movie like this takes itself seriously, but it's true, and it shows. On top of that, the movie is beautifully made and everyone in the cast does an excellent job. I really enjoyed it, and I'll be buying my own DVD to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Baz Lurhman is truly a creative genius and his work on this film is astounding. The colors, the textures, the music, the chaos, the characters all weave together to create one of the most stimulating and thrilling experiences ever. Nicole Kidman can sing and Ewan McGregor can really sing! Granted, this film is not for everyone. Some may find it dizzying - a sensory overload - but for those of us brought up in the MTV generation it fits together beautifully. It is a musical (or perhaps more correctly a mini opera), a drama, a comedy, a love story and a special effects extravaganza all rolled into one beautiful work of art. Bits and pieces of some of the most esteemed movies and songs of our time aid in the telling of this tale, reworked to fit into the heightened world of the Moulin Rouge. Definitely worth the time and money as long as you can handle all the visual festivity. The 2-disc DVD is loaded with extras as well as hidden "easter eggs".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant. Spectacularly Brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never have I seen such a movie that was so spectacular. To me, Moulin Rouge! is the epitome of the modern musical. I think that Baz Luhrmann is an incredible genius to have revitalized the musical in films today, succeeding where many others have failed (i.e., Woody Allen). It begins as a story about a penniless English writer named Christian, played by Ewan McGregor, goes to Paris to be inspired, circa 1900. He is befriend by Toulouse Lautrec, played by John Leguizamo, and introduces him to the decadence that is the Moulin Rouge nightclub. There he falls in love with a courtesan named Satine, played by Nicole Kidman. It is a beautiful musical, and the movie takes you on a whirlwind of colors and songs, sometimes letting you forget that Satine and Christian are doomed lovers to begin with.I'm surprised that this movie didn't pick up an Oscar for Nicole, especially for Best Picture, instead losing out to the particularly bland 'A Beautiful Mind'. I'm also surprised that the Academy didn't even nominate Baz Luhrmann with an Oscar for Best Director, and the biggest crime that they committed was not even mentioning Ewan's brilliant performance.Even Nicole has talent in her ways, and this was probably her first most noticeable role as a leading lady, it is Ewan who truly carries the film. You can see throughout the film there are times where she's unsure of herself, being in a musical, especially when she's singing, but it is for Ewan that you most sympathize with. He is the one who is able to handle best the flexibility of the many emotions of Moulin Rouge!, and is the most talented vocally.Many people were astonished to hear that these actors could sing. I wasn't that surprised when it came to Ewan McGregor, because I had heard him sing briefly in 1996's Emma. Even Sir Elton John was so amazed by Ewan's performance of his song, 'Your Song' that he predicted that he could have a very successful career as a recording artist.And of course, there will be endless comparisons with Moulin Rouge! and Chicago, especially after this year with Chicago picking up several Oscar awards. People have critiqued Moulin Rouge! as extreme, and unoriginal. I guess it's because that historical references being dated into more modern movies is something that Baz Luhrmann has done before. I honestly feel that Moulin Rouge! in its own way, more original than Chicago. The only thing that is unoriginal, are the songs, in my opinion. Chicago the musical, itself has been around for decades, and some consider the film a revival, not a new idea.Also Baz has explained in the past, fearing that his 'musical' would not be accepted, saying that one of the reasons he used modern pop songs in his movie was to carry it mainstream. He felt that he had to use modern songs, for a musical to be accepted in modern society.And of course there were times that I felt when they broke into song, i.e., 'Like a Virgin', it felt a bit silly. And I remember watching in the movie theater, when they started with 'Roxanne', people were giggling in the audience; when it was supposed to be a serious moment in the film, referring to the disastrous effects when you "fall in love with a woman who sells herself." Of course there were beautiful moments and songs in the movie, like with its only original song, 'Come what may'. There will be times that it might upset the audience, but according to Baz, he has his reasons for it.I can only hope that Baz can continue making musical movies like this, because Moulin Rouge! is one of my favorite movies of all time, regardless of how many times I've seen it. No one else can make decadence look this glamorous; and rarely</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all of the enthusiasm surrounding this movie, I found it to contain really very little substance. While many movie-goers will no doubt entertain themselves by pointing out the identity of all of the songs pilfered for use in this movie, they will hopefully not fail to overlook the fact that this schticky ploy, coupled with the uncomfortable cinematography and editing spearheaded by Baz Luhrmann, really makes the movie more annoying than endearing.Additionally, careful viewers will note a remarkably strong similarity in plot to another recent, far-superior movie, which I will neglect to name so as not to provide a spoiler. However, the aforementioned, nameless film is much better written, is more clever and intelligent, and really blows this movie out of the water.Still, much can be said for the colorful, vibrant set design, as well as the masterful performances by John Leguizamo and Ewan McGregor. Throw in a perma-beautiful Nicole Kidman, and you have a movie that might be worth renting. But if you've figured out which much-celebrated movie I've referred to earlier in my review, I would recommend it much more highly.</fullReview>

It was bright splashes of sound, colour and general halucigenic imagery that it leaves your head spinning when you're done watching it.Not that it's a bad movie. I've liked, although the first hour Luhrmann tries to be, maybe, a bit TOO weird. He tries to give us too much in the first hour, and then there's far to much post-production slow motion. Far too much.Other than that Moulin Rouge! is great! The last hour is brilliant, even though it is a bit raunchy. And who can forget Nicole and Ewan's singing! Great!But I guess, like pot, you might be left with a headache at end. Beware the Weird Red Windmill if you don't like Strange Cinema.And if you don't like it, I understand completely!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had my suspicions taking a chance on this one. "nominated for Best Picture" usually sends up a red flag in my head. This film was TOTAL NONSENSE. Everything was artificial: the love story, the singing, the dancing, the emotions. All cartoon acting. Without the musical numbers, you'd think you were watching a bad Monty Python sketch. All put together by the editors at MTV. Did you notice that every song began by the lyrics spoken, not sung? That's so that the audience could say, "Hey, that sounds familiar! What IS that?" And what film could be complete without Jim Broadbent wrapped in a table cloth singing "Like a Virgin"? Pure poetry!!!No, my friends. The wool was pulled over your eyes once more by sparkling, colorful, polished turds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge! is absolutely breathtaking and takes you on such a wonderful journey that it's one you have to watch a few times.I've seen this about 20 times as I have it on DVD and every time Ewan McGregor sings Your Song, it pulls at my heartstrings. He's definitely a wonderful actor and you can really tell he put all his heart and soul into the role of Christian and Nicole as Satine was just as wonderful.Nicole has finally stepped out of the shadows and has shown the world what us Aussies have known since the 1980s.Everything about this film is pure magic, the first 20 minutes is such a rollercoaster ride and once you get past that is when the heart and soul of the film emerges.Jim Broadbent is a fine actor and is finally getting recognition - his past few roles in Moulin Rouge!, Bridget Jones' Diary and his Oscar winning performance this year for Iris not only shows us his versatility but also he puts everything into his role.The soundtracks are amazing as well with the recent release of volume 2 a winner as well and the soundtracks and movie are a definite must for adding to your collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The incredibly popular film Moulin Rouge is a sad comment on modern cinema-goers. To start with, most young people I know who are literally obsessed with this film don't even know the song Lady Marmalade is remade from the Patti LaBelle version, not to say that the entire film is a remake! It's music video style cinematography, I'm afraid will contribute to the decay of filmaking until what we now know as trailers will pass for full length films. The entire film caters to pop culture youth marketability and the declining attention span of its audience. Never was I convinced the characters were in love, despite the emotional output by Ewan McGregor at the end. Instead of giving the professionals (Kidman and McGregor) a chance to act, the audience is supposed to believe the characters are truly in love because they are shown in bed together in a musical montage sequence! Also overlooking the historical anachronisms, and the coincidence that the real Moulin Rouge is in Paris France despite all lack of French influence on the film - and the fact that no prostitute looks as gorgeous as Nicole Kidman, the movie is a tired cliche. I was not drawn in by the theatrical falsity of the Moulin Rouge, both the movie and the love story.</fullReview>

Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor fit their roles well, and their talent as singers is exceptional, considering they weren't singers previous to the film. My major point is: does anyone see a similarity to the opera 'La Traviata'? It follows the same storyline, with the same plot, and the same ending. The main female even has tuberculosis.

		<fullReview>The movie is very good. No doubt about that. But the editing is too fast for me. Take for example the wonderful tango sequence. In my opinion that wonderful sequence is so much over-edited that it looses most of its impact. On disk too (DVD version) you can see the sequence as it should have looked. This goes for some other sequences too. The cutting is so fast, that one can hardly see what happens and many shots get lost in that way. That really is a pity. That is my criticism. The story, the music and the acting are first class. Nicole Kidman, who has impressed me since "Bangkok Hilton", is better than ever. The costumes and sets are fantastic. (Everything was filmed in Australia; the crew did not even see Paris!). One can hardly believe this.I have to see this movie again and maybe yet another time until I think I have really seen everything. But I don't mind. It is a feast for the eye.I would never have given an Oscar for the editing, however, but I have started with that criticism already. With a bit more restrained editing I would have given 10/10, now it is "just" 8/10.</fullReview>

Yes, through it all, there they stood, proud, magnificent, defiant, and against the wind like a bulwark to a raging storm. Unfortunately, the film got better. And better. And better. Soon I found myself in a quandry.....torn between staring at the close-ups of Nicole, or ACTUALLY paying attention to the increasingly interesting film. Understanding there was no way I could preform both at the same time, alas, I eventually gave in and watched the movie, knowing full well that I would never overreach yonder mountains in this lifetime anyway. Undaunted, I proudly went back to the guys at the office, held my head up high and said..YES! I sat through an entire MUSICAL....and I LIKED it!Suffice it to say that all in all, they,...um...

There's no great musical talent onscreen (at least from the two leads, although they're not bad), and no gripping story, and "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return" sounds like a Hallmark card from hell. Compare that to "A life lived in fear is a life half lived" from Luhrmann's STRICTLY BALLROOM (which is a superior film in most other ways as well).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art, Trash, Love, Tragedy &amp; Post Modernism in one amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, let's get one thing straight out of the gates. Art is a subjective thing and everyone has their own personal definition of what is good art and bad art. I'm not going to come out and say that Moulin Rouge IS cinematic art, but I think I can safely say that it's trying to do what good art has always set out to do, and that is engage the audience and make them work a little, think a little and feel a LOT. I think it's great the the film has generated such a polarized response in viewers. If nothing else, that means that it's definitely NOT a middle of the road movie. Let's forget about Baz Luhrmann and his rhapsodizing about "heightened reality" and "establishing a contract with the audience" or "decoding the period for modern viewers." What he's done in this lavish, challenging and often extreme film is what the very best art attempts to do; communicate the basic human experience (In this case, love and the beauty/tragedy thereof) by stripping it down to bare essentials, by exaggerating certain elements, by putting all the artifice available to modern artists in order to explore a basic and primal element of our lives. In a world where we have come to acknowledge that there's no such thing as an original idea, only original variations, it's nice to see someone produce a wonderful, original variation that is unapologetic, dynamic and engaging.There is nothing naturalistic about this film, but then there is very little naturalistic in what most consider the great works of art our time. It is fun, it is BIG, it is fast, touching, sentimental, rebellious. It is the very essence of the Bohemian ideals it espouses if Bohemians were given a multi-million dollar budget and lifetime supply of absinthe for "inspiration".This is not a movie for everyone. Literalists should stay far, FAR away. Lazy viewers should not even leave the house, because it's not that kind of film. But if you're willing to work a little, to buy into what the movie is selling, and to take the hand extended to you when the rollercoaster arrives, you'll find a movie full of hard work, technical mastery, amazing performances and, best of all, a reason to maybe not be so cynical about people, the world we live in, and above all things, love.Bazmark productions should be very proud of what they've created. They set out to provoke something in the world of movies and I think they've done that. This film will be an influence on young film makers, dreamers and lovers for years to come. I applaud Baz Luhrmann for doing what so many aspire to and few actually do; taking a risk on something that matters. And being willing to let the rest of the world see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like everyone I talk to about this movie has a strong opinion of it. They either absolutely love it or absolutely hate it. There have been a few borderline opinions, but for the most part it's a love/hate movie.I thought I would love Moulin Rouge. It seemed like my kind of movie. I've always been a sucker for musicals, afterall. I didn't hate it, but I didn't really love it either. I'm one of the few people who falls in the in-between pile. I thought that the movie was great as far as visual effects and costumes good. The acting was also very good and the singing could have been much worse, but a note to the leads- don't quit your day job. The movie managed to be funny, happy, thought-provoking, and ultimately tragic. It was a very emotional movie and even made me get a little teary eyed at the end.The main plot in Moulin Rouge centers around the love between Satine and Christian. Their love was really a fairly typical Hollywood love affair though. They fall for each other too quickly and form an inseperable bond that was really unrealistic. While I did think their relationship was very sweet, the cynical person in me couldn't help noting how completely unrealistic it was. I can see how a lot of people would hate this movie and how others would adore it. It really depends if you let yourself get into it, I think. Only if you ignore the semi-butchering of songs you love and the underdevelopment of the characters, and just let yourself get lost in the eye-candy and craziness before you will Moulin Rouge take off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge was a truly wonderful movie that I will love for many years to come. I had never been into love stories of any sort until I saw this movie. Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor brought Satine and Christin to life with their amazing voices and outstanding acting talents. Baz Luhrmann did a wonderful job at making the Moulin Rouge and all it's characters come to life. It was amazing to me how they took all these hits and made them seem like new again. The costumes were amazing and gave it all the more life and energy. The Dance numbers were exhilirating and amazing. It was a truly wonderful movie and will always be at the top of my list. Not only because it is original and unique but a journey told through song and dance about to people who love eachother but are pulled apart by jelousy. It is a truly wonderful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>something is off about this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I talk about my opinions of this movie, I'd just like to say that I do understand WHY this movie is popular - it's just quirky enough. And if you are one of those people who likes this kind of movie (and you know who you are), then this movie is still recommended to you.Now, I just felt that there was something off about this movie. It might be due to any or all of these things:1) The end of the movie is revealed within the first five minutes. Therefore, it should be no spoiler to say that SHE DIES.2) The frenzied editing, direction, and just plain atmosphere of this movie are so ostentatious that it continues to remind us that we are just watching a movie. We can't escape into the movie because it looks and feels nothing like real life. With a more realistic movie, it's easier for us to surrender to the movie and let the characters and plot take us where they may.3) The story around which the movie is centered is unoriginal and clichéic. The real plot isn't much without it's style and music. Yes, the music is fantastic, and yes, this is a nice-looking movie, but the movie should be about its plot rather than about its style. I don't know. I just couldn't get this movie. It was too eccentric and arrogant for me. Oh well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like musicals. I have respect for how much hard work goes into them, but I just don't usually like them. And I have horrible childhood memories of being forced to watch The Sound of Music. Plus I had a grudge against this film due to the Lady Marmalade remake that was played 10,000 times on the radio. But I decided not to judge until I had seen it, so I rented it. I actually really like this film.It comes from the director who made the great 1996 Romeo and Juliet. People on this board who complain (I don't take them 100% seriously, due to the fact that they are all probably anal musical fans) about how the supporting characters are all cartoony probably didn't notice the fact that the story is being typed by Christian, and it's like he's going through it in his mind exaggerating it and the characters, making it more fun to "read". My other theory is that the overacting was to mock acting in most musicals (watch Grease and tell me it's not overacting its' butt off).The film has a lot of elaborate beauty in it, most of it shown in short scenes (which makes me just want to watch it over and over). The whole splicing of contemporary songs to make the songs in the movie is a novel and entertaining idea (I think it'll be the only time you'll hear Nirvana in a musical). The most entertaining thing in the movie is the overall theme of love, in all its' tragic craziness. I think McGregor and Kidman were very good in this flick, not only as singers, but acting as a couple caught in a tragic love tale.So if you are looking for something with a little more creativity and pizazz than anything Julie Andrews or your run-of-the-mill musical will get you, go to Moulin Rouge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge! was a wonderful film- daring , exquisite , and insightful. The close resemblance to opera or operetta was quite striking to me. Some of the images linger long after the film is over: the turning windmill , the close-ups of the actors , the lighting, and the fireworks that reinforced the emotional moods.Wonderfully acted by Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor , this was a movie to savor especially in our troubled times. The themes still are needed to remind us of the worthwhile values in life: truth , freedom , beauty , and most of all- Love.</fullReview>

It is structured upon an emblematic story of that century: La Dama de las Camelias and is colored with the best music of those gone times.It transforms an entertainment musical into an art film. This is achieved through fast change from one sequence to other. And this is done with Edition, Cinematography, Clothing and Music.Not an easy film, not for every taste but a paradigmatic work for the film-making of the starting century.

		<shortDescription>Film-making at the expense of the narrative.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I'm going against the flow, but ...Having seen Baz Luhrmann's `Romeo and Juliette', I approached `Moulin Rouge!' with some trepidation. I found R &amp; J interesting yet flawed (I felt that the modern setting was unnecessary and sensationalist, and what made the film special was its sheer energy and verve). I was ready to dislike the use of modern songs in MR for similar reasons, but in the end I found that aspect of the film perfectly acceptable and even fitting!However, taken as a whole, I found the film self-indulgent, over-directed, over-edited, and pretentious.There is no doubt that Mr Luhrmann is a very talented film-maker, with highly original and daring ideas. However, I can't help but feel that style should be used to enhance and embellish the narrative, while here the story is saturated with style to such an extent it is virtually suffocated. I think there is quite a moving tragic tale going on underneath the very glossy exterior, but I found it very difficult to get particularly involved as my attention was constantly drawn to yet another directorial device rather than the storyline. The most interesting and entertaining passages were the slower, more gentle ones, which did not involve sudden and disorientating cuts to and fro.I will undoubtedly be accused of being old-fashioned, but I appreciate a film whose story is considered paramount, and where directorial style and skill are used to enhance that story. When the audience is more aware of how a film is put together, I'm afraid the director may be accused of having failed in his task.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please tell me it was a spoof....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WEll...as I do every year, I make a late end push to see all the films with oscar buzz, thus I found myself renting Moulin on DVD. First the good points:A) the technical merits were all stunning. The lighting, sound, cinematography,(esp the opening CGI shot), costumes(brilliant) and art direction were all world class. As I sat and watched the film I said to myself "this may give LOTR a run for its money in all things technical that arent CGI". So, kudos to the grunts who did the tech workNow the bad parts.Script, script, script. All of the above was ruined once the actors openend their mouths. Now, granted, I didnt walk into the theater expecting say the drama of Eisenstein..but still, for an oscar-touted film I expected some sort of ...I dunno....depth to the screenplay. Around hour three,(right around the time my rear started to really ache) I finally said to myself "you know...maybe its like a spoof..an Homage to the culture of the late 19th century fin-de-cicle Paris...maybe its intent is not to *really* tell a story as much as it is to paint a sketch of the time period..." I really hope this was the case. Any decent opera fan will have flashbacks of familiarity during the film. It is a combination La Traviata( doomed courtesan(whore-)with comsumption(Tuberculosis) gives up her idealistic(and dim) lover to save him and goes under the protection of a powerful Duke), and one part La Boheme( poor, penniless artists of late 19th cen paris[ Mcgregor and CO} live it up while their writer friend [Mcgregor] falls in love with a woman doomed to die of consumption[kidman]). So, with that pre knowledge of the genre and of the time period I thought to myself, maybe the director is giving an homage to these operas and the time period in general, and making them accesible to the modern viewer by using 'pop' melodrama instead of an original score to underline the story. Now, that idea settled better with me than the trite garbage that I sat thru for close on three hours. But still, even if it was the directors intention, its nearly a waste of good lighting and costumes. Now..I enjoy a silly spectacle as much as anyone ( I love Rocky Horror, hell, I even own a copy of Pirates of Penzance on VHS...but those movies had no pretensions of serious filmaking in either case nor the budget of Moulin)....but, I just found the whole film , while pretty to look at, trite and vapid. Granted, the storylines of the original operas arent that much better...but at least they had the brilliance of Verdi and Puccini to elevate the words and give them meaning...sadly, Madonna doesnt quite do that in this film.In short....its a visual spectacle, but at the end, all I really wanted to do was put on my cd of La boheme and flush the taste of this movie out of my mouth.Incidentallly, I also saw Hedwig and the Angry Inch that night, and by far that was the smarter, and better made musical....with original music to boot! However, Moulin did win on eye candy. But, I do think that maybe one reviewer on here had it right when he said this film was sort of an experiment, on just how far you can stretch a story with the soundtrack. Lets face it, the mark of movie lacking any real strong storytelling is the proliferance of the score to give weight to the 'emotional' moments of the film ( see Titanic, Pearl Harbor, LOTR,nearly any Speilberg movie etc) So, this movie takes it one step further, by incorporating the score into the actual storyline...I must say, judging by the result of the hoopla, MR. Luhrman may be on to something...and thats very sad to learn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lazy film-making for the masses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Moulin Rouge!' is an abysmal cover-version of John Huston's film of the same name from the fourties. The word of mouth was good- whereas the songs I'd heard on the radio were not- out of curiosity I paid my ??'s and experienced the film.Never have I been so bored and embarrassed- I was close to walking out- which is not a very British thing to do, as we have a thing about 'things we've paid for'. So, endure I did.This film is nothing like a decent musical- I'll direct you to 'All That Jazz', 'Cabaret', 'An American in Paris', 'On the Town' &amp; 'Singin in the Rain' to see what one is like. Even a recent episode of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' attempted (and succeeded) with original songs &amp; dances that advance the characters and storyline. 'Dancer in the Dark' re-used 'The Sound of Music' to give Bjork's character the location to escape to- and sing &amp; dance her original songs. This film, on the other hand, just uses lazy 20th century songs &amp; references. Lazy post-modernity that academics will discuss with undergraduates, as they did with the over-rated 'Romeo &amp; Juliet'.What gets me is the dearth of originality- Nicole Kidman sings 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend', with a snatch of Madonna's 'Material Girl'- whose video made reference to 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes', in which Monroe sang 'Diamonds are...'. How wacky. At least when 'A Clockwork Orange' &amp; Morecombe/Wise re-used 'Singin in the Rain' it was with an original twist. The can-can song is abysmal; worse is the 'Teen Spirit' cover. The whole point of the original was for the band to sing to the audience "Here we are now/entertain us" as an ironic inversion of the traditional r'ship between audience and performer. It was ironic and very early 90's- this is tragic and says absolutely NOTHING. Other horrors await, Lamb's 'Goreki' is ruined- as is 'Your Song'- though the Queen song has always been an atrocity...We get a p***-poor story- half-arsed 'A Mad World, My Masters' territory. Deeply irritating camerawork; sub-'Querelle'-sets (the film does feel like the work of a heterosexual Fassbinder). McGregor is miscast and woefully underwritten, the love story is too rapid- a concession to the audience? Kidman has that special kind of consumption- where she still looks angelic. The depiction of Toulouse La Trec&amp; Fin de Siecle Paris is deeply flawed- diluted in a late 90's/early zeroes kinda way- we get the dawn of the 20th century- seemingly just for the sake of it. The 'Bollywood'-bit is alright- but you could get that by watching the real thing or Basement Jaxx's 'Romeo'-video. What kind of writer is McGregor's character meant to be? Why don't we have absinthe related phantasmagoria? Why do we get the ironic use of Kylie? Why did people rave over this film?It offers zero great songs- like Rodgers &amp; Hammerstien etc- and the choreography is rather ordinary compared to something like Bjork's 'It's Oh So Quiet'. Heck, even Coppola's 'One From The Heart' tried (and mostly failed); to see a great musical moment on screen- check out 'Llorando' in 'Mulholland Dr' or Teresa Salgueiro in Wim Wenders 'The Lisbon Story'. Or Isabella Rossellini in 'Blue Velvet', the Swing-scene in 'Swingers', the Neil Diamond moment in 'Beautiful Girls', THAT dance-scene in 'Bande a part' (ripped off for 'Pulp Fiction')or the 'Memo from Turner'-sequence in 'Performance'.Or Woody Allen's 'Everyone Says I Love You'.Not forgetting 'Tommy'!'Moulin Rouge!' is MOR postmodernism for the multiplex masses at its most funtional. It quite rightly got overlooked for the Oscars- not that they're worth much more than audience ratings and a short-term love affair with the studios. I object to such a lazy film being deemed a musical- and the notion that the youth of today thinks this is what a musical is like. This relates to the problem at the root of Western (well, American) cinema- where people used to watch Bergman, Fellini, Kurosawa et al, they now watch 'Star Wars', 'Pulp Fiction', 'Trainspotting', 'Bridget Jones'. Populism has won out- the artistic notion is governed by the ethics of mass-marketing to a monocultural cartel. People who are going into cinema and film studies have no concept of any history, no depth of knowledge. Call me a snob- but where would Martin Scorsese or Woody Allen (or most film-makers) be without watching significant examples of cinema? 'Moulin Rouge!' is a mediocre slab of populism aimed at the TV-babies than anyone with any sense of cinematic lineage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intentional kitsch = the opposite of emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admire all the hard work that went into this big fancy movie. It looks like it was expensive and complicated to make, and all the designers and actors do a really impressive job. Good for them.But this movie is, simply, wrong. If they made Casablanca and instead of Humphrey Bogart, they had a chimpanzee playing Rick, we'd point to the chimp and tell the director, "No, sorry. You screwed up. That chimp shouldn't be here. It's a mistake and now your movie doesn't work. You have to scrap this all and start again." Baz Luhrmann needs to scrap this movie (and 'Strictly Ballroom,' too, incidentally) and start again.The problem is this: there has never been a movie so exuberantly kitschy (or do I mean campy?) as Moulin Rouge Exclamation Point - but there's already some trouble brewing in the whole idea of doing something to be INTENTIONALLY outrageously kitschy. When outlandishly dumb things happen in this movie (Boing! Whoo!), we can't chuckle and say, "oh my god, can you believe how ridiculous that was?" because of COURSE we can believe it - it's the whole point, after all. If we were watching a REAL old musical, and someone started speaking the lyrics to a song, we might have something to chuckle at - what naivete! what sweetly, pathetically sincere absurdity - but in this in-your-face movie, the dumb-ness is just part of the game, and so it's hard to see it as anything but...dumb. I guess you have to suspend your disbelief - disbelief not that the story is real, but that the movie is naive.But that pales in comparison to the real problem, which is that once we're thinking, "how outrageous and ridiculous this crazy show is!" we are at the diametric opposite point on the emotional circle (as it turns out, emotions come on a circle - thought you should know) to being moved by anything. When Baz et. al. come out shouting that this is a movie about Truth, Beauty, Nutmeg and Whatever, I'm thinking, "I hear ya - Boing, Whoo!, Truth!, Beauty!, I gotcha, buddy." But then as it goes on I get this creepy feeling that he really DOES think it's about Truth, Beauty, Whatever. Good lord. If this is a movie about people's emotions, where are the people? Where, even, are the puppets to represent people? All I see are bits of cultural flotsam being thrown against each other to create sparks of camp - a pretty empty show at best.What really pains me is that so many people (people I thought were my friends! people I used to respect!) are of the same mind as Baz, and eat this movie up. They're saying, "It's so MOVING when Rick puts Ilsa on the plane and doesn't go with her - and the monkey was so FUNNY!" No. Either this is a movie about a funny monkey, or it's a love story. It can't be both - I can draw a diagram on paper to show you why if you don't believe me. I KNOW there are people reading this right now thinking, "he just doesn't get it - the whole point of this movie is that it uses a veneer of crazy kitschiness to get at the real live beating heart of emotion," but they are, in fact, wrong. If you find yourself moved by the hackneyed nonsense that serves as the plot of Moulin Rouge(!), I'm happy for you, I really am - but that means you're absolutely not entitled to pretend that you understand the point of kitsch. Unless you really don't, and you just love it all at face value! God help us if all these Moulin Rouge! fans think the beyond-infantile 'Boing's and 'Whoo!'s are actual comedy as opposed to meta-comedy. Maybe it all just RESEMBLES kitsch, but it's been assembled by a total naive, who really doesn't know the difference. A chilling thought - but having seen the movie, I could believe it.If you thought this movie was about love, you (and Baz) have been so deeply blinded by a post-modern world that you don't realize that to move from irony to emotion, you go DOWN a level in manic allusiveness, not UP. It's just a fact.One more time: "The Sound of Music" is a song about something, from a musical. "The Sound of Music" as it appears in 'Moulin Rouge!' is just a floating fragment of culture used as a prop to make a joke that is so corny and childish as to be only excusable by the idea that it is the joke itself that is being made fun of - and thus is not a song, is not about anything, and is not in a musical.No amount of WILD FLAMBOYANT PRODUCTION and FAST CUTTING can disguise the fact that this movie has a chimp in it - or, really, that this chimp has a movie around it. And a flimsy one at that.</fullReview>

Zoom in to the window, zoom out from the window, zoom in again, zoom out again...So much red velvet and crepe you begin to pray for a touch of green. Most of the songs fit into the movie the way Rush Limbaugh fits in at an NSync concert. The principals can sing in a highly tutored, competent sort of way, but don't exactly bring Judy Garland or Gene Kelly to mind. Nothing about this movie really had any effect on me. I couldn't care less about the characters or their love story. It seemed to be trying to be "Shakespeare in Love", "Titanic", and a bit of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" to boot, without ever really achieving any of it. If you loved this film I'm very happy for you, but it felt more like 228 rather than 128 minutes to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm truly disappointed. I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for quite awhile.Moulin Rouge! could have been a truly great movie if someone would have held Baz Luhrmann's hand and restrained him a bit. Unfortunately, the film suffered from many of the shortcomings of Romeo and Juliet, but this time they were amplified beyond all reason. Baz Luhrmann's editing, while innovative, is nothing short of self-indulgent. It takes over the film, interrupts the story, and turns the film into a mediocre overly-long music video.I don't fault any of the performances...not even the singing. The story was actually pretty good...when it was allowed to unfold. Had the film-makers exercised some self-control in the editing room, this movie could have easily taken place inside of one hour. It also could have been a very good movie. Luhrmann is a visual genius, but he needs to be reined in a bit.</fullReview>

They haven't seen the originals, they have no standards, they're decadent from being over-entertained, they've grown up in an unspeakably corrupt system, their attention spans have been destroyed by commercial interruptions, they're chemically unbalanced by all the estrogen in commercial fried chicken, et cetera. But I am baffled at last by the vogue for "Moulin Rouge." I've conceded to, if not comprehended Stephen King, Andrew Lloyd Webber, insult comedies, gangstah rap, and Quentin Tarantino, but the sloppiness, vulgarity, and shrill camp of "Moulin Rouge" defeat me. I can find no way of contemplating this awkward construction that does not leave it looking like garbage. I find myself weeping for the great artists who labored with unrelenting perfectionism to make the beautiful musicals of the past tributes to human potential. Why, I ask myself, did they whip themselves to present masterpieces of grace when the public will settle for such clumsy dreck as "Moulin Rouge?" I suppose all true artists really work for themselves, and to satisfy some muse who bids them make life a little, or a lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They were not thinking, that's the problem. I wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't get emotionally attached to the characters. The songs were just plain bad. No movie made me hate "Roxanne" and "Like A Virgin" like this one. The only really good thing was that the visuals were nice, but there wasn't enough content to make me get involved. I sat in the theatre, bored to death, wishing the movie would end, with everyone dying in the end or something. Seriously, though, I wish Nicole and Ewan had been used a lot more effectively and been given an actual "ROMANCE" instead of just a really contrived, forced, tragic love angle that never really convinced me. I actually laughed when I saw it, but not because it was intentionally funny. If you want a musical with actual CHARACTERS, watch Sound Of Music, West Side Story, or even Dancer In The Dark. Maybe the later is a not technically a musical, but at least it told an involving STORY, and not just a bombardment of flashy, MTV-paced images that attempt to convince you that even though it has no real actual content with it's pretty pictures, it's a honest-to-God-Best-Picture-Contender... it's not that at all.For the discerning viewer, there are much better pictures in 2001. Pictures that make you think and have a good story. If you haven't seen Moulin Rouge, you've already seen it in, as one other reader commented, as Shakespeare In Love, the undeserving Best Picture winner from 1998, which beat out Saving Private Ryan, for those of you who have forgotten. At least Shakespeare in Love had better dialogue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read all the comments on this film. I have heard all my friends talk about it. And the only thing that can come to mind is the book "The Fountainhead" by Ayn Rand. Have any of you read it? There's a part in the book where a young playwright writes this terrible play. But a columnist for a prestigious newspaper tells him to go for it. So he does. The columnist writes great reviews for it, everyone else writes good reviews for it, soon everyone thinks it's a wonderful play. But it's not. It's crap. I was told over and over that Moulin Rouge was unlike anything I'd ever seen. This is true. I enjoyed it for about five minutes. I thought "Oh, how funny. They're making fun of The Sound of Music." I thought "Well that's sort of clever. They're singing a Nirvana song". About the 10th time, it got old. Very old. But there's still a story to pay attention to, right? Something I can focus on to forget the music? No. There isn't. Nothing is original in this film. The comedy is faintly reminiscent of Jar-Jar Binks. The music reminded me of a karaoke bar, and the story was stolen from Melrose Place. The visuals were the only redeeming factor. And I can't say they were very redeeming. I found myself falling asleep toward the end. Basically, go see this movie if you like bright shiny things and songs you've heard a million times before. If you don't feel like leaving the room, just turn on MTV and watch the music video for it. It's basically the same experience. You're not missing much.</fullReview>

I missed the point that there were people giving this film maximum rating, but there were also reviews with hate relationship.

Musicals are not my favorites and that's what this is mainly about. Drama and romance could hurt your intelligence a little bit in Moulin Rouge. Nicole Kidman is not so heavenly beautiful and face of Ewan McGregor reminds me gigolo not a young poet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film. It is amazing to watch. A string of superlatives that ringed the globe could not come near to describing it.Being a dancer, I loved the dance scenes (some of my friends were in them), they were unbelievably good. Very passionate and over-the-top, wonderful to watch.I loved the way Baz mixed current and past culture in so many ways - it made what could have been a period film into a relatable entity for so many people.The costumes in this film were remarkable as were the sets and effects, I could go on and on and start to write (probably really bad) poetry, that's how moving the visuals in Moulin Rouge were.HOWEVER I have one complaint: I did not cry. I was not moved by this film. It is an easy thing to do - I'm an emotional person, I walk into the cinema looking for opportunities to be swept away and moved inside by the production. Not in this movie though. The fundamental problem, for me, was the love affair. The love was not deep enough, they had not shared enough, their love had not really been tested enough for me to believe in it. Oh sure there was the Count, but he was a cartoon character - to ridiculous to be believably evil. I could not see him as a serious threat to the love of Satine and Christian.So there's my complaint. I couldn't cry at the demise of a love that was really too insubstantial to begin with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It could have so easily gone wrong, this film. Musicals aren't made anymore for a reason. That reason is many people, like me, feel they're kind of silly. People don't dance to settle arguments, they don't break into singing just because they're happy and even when they do they're usually so drunk you can't understand a word they're 'singing'. And before you disagree, just think of that ill-conceived Titanic musical (for krissake). But that's not the only reason this could have gone very, very wrong. Having actors sing is about as good an idea as having singers act, especially considering Ewan McGregor's casting (anyone remember A Life Less Ordinary's sing-and-dance routine?). And then there's a completely unhinged madman director like Baz Luhrman. It could indeed have been awful. What it is however, is the most innovative, spectacular, gripping and beautiful film this year.Luhrmann continues what he had already done in William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, which is combining the commercial (using modern music and a surprisingly heavy dose of comedy) with the artistic (the heavily theatrical stylings and loaded emotional content). Moulin Rouge! (it really deserves the exclamation mark) is most definitely a pop-opera. Technically, this is the crossbreed between unhinged and brilliant. With CG-rollercoaster shots through Paris, amazing production design and about as much edits you can fit into a two-hour film without driving your audience fully insane this is a visual feast every second of its running time. Even topnotch stylists like Ridley Scott don't come close.Sound however is not forgotten (it is a real musical, you know). Luhrmann uses many different types of music and has everything from Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend to Material Girl to Smells Like Teen Spirit to FatBoy Slim's loose interpretation of the cancan thrown into the first 15 minutes or so. Of course, they're all reworkings of the original songs, but they're both so recognisable and different I doubt any fans of the originals have a right to be insulted. With such a wide variety of music, the movie's bound to have both high- and lowlights, my personal favourite being a tango-like version of Roxanne. I don't really dislike a single song, although I could have done without one of the film's many love ballads by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. Not that's it's their fault, really. McGregor shows himself a talented singer and Kidman is truly spectacular. The same goes for their acting. Jim Broadbent is fine but I did think John Leguizamo could have been better. Special kudos go to Richard Roxburgh, who is absolutely hilarious as the movie's villainous Duke.So, with so much madly OTT style it really can't be expected to have any substance, right? Wrong. Moulin Rouge! may be more of triumph of moviemaking than it is of screenwriting, it's definitely not as empty as certain critics would have you believe. It's basic premise is simple enough (it simply combines most great old plays about beauty, truth, freedom and above all love) but it's filled with emotions that seem cliches but are brought with such compelling honestly you can't help (or at least I couldn't, which, for someone who usually prefers cynicism above optimism and intelligence above emotion, is quite surprising) but be swept away be it. No, it won't exactly keep you talking about the relationship between art and real-life as portrayed so vividly on screen. In fact, I doubt it will keep you talking at all, but Moulin Rouge! is a film to experience, not to dissect.In short, Moulin Rouge! is a one of those once-a-year type films, which re-establishes your faith in the belief that Hollywood money can be used to create something utterly unique and astoundingly beautiful. The kind of film you hope won't be insulted by the Academy (but you know probably will).Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Moulin Rouge' is probably one of the best films I've seen all year. It's the cinematic equivalent to being tied to a four-poster bed, having your eyes pinned open, ala 'clockwork orange' and having a mixture of honey, sugar and vaseline smeared over your eyeballs whilst Nirvana and Elton John let off fireworks just behind your ears. Lovely!! The screen chemistry between Obi Wan and Kidman is hot, hot, hot. They can both sing (Ewan struggles sometimes but I think that just adds to the movies charm) If I've got any criticism it's that, the film is predictable and, like Jim Broadbents paunch, it does start to sag a bit towards the end. In all though, I thoroughly recommend it, for pure escapist entertainment. Finally, I've got to applaud Mcgregor and Kidman for tackling these parts, it's this kind of diversity that sets them apart as two of the best actors around at the moment. Hats of to Baz Lurman's outrageously over the top direction. Every scene could be framed and placed lovingly above your fireplace. It really is *cliche alert* a rollercoaster ride of a film. Get on board!! See this show, before it shuts down!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I totally agree with all those other contributors who've heaped such lavish praise on this movie. As a spectacle it was stunning, an assault on the senses, but I don't think I've ever come across a movie where the views of the critics are so polarised. It's either one of the best films of all time or else it's total garbage. When I saw it at least 6 people walked out. I guess some people don't like weird movies, and let's face it this is a weird movie, it doesn't obey any of the rules, and some people are obviously uncomfortable with that.But I do have one big criticism, and that is Nicole Kidman's performance. I did not believe for one minute that Satine loved Christian. She was too cool, she was too distant, she could have been wondering how the hell she got involved in such a movie, but she was not in love. I've asked myself several times whether that mattered in such a surreal film where style triumphs over everything, but I think it does. Love is the message, this is a film about love and Baz Luhrman could have found an actress who looked as if she was mad about the boy. Instead we got Kidman trying to be Marlene Dietrich.It was still wonderful, but it could have been almost perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just the first few minutes of "Moulin Rouge" totally blew me away! Everything from the set designs to the art direction to the editing to the cinematography to the costume designs are absolutely spectacular! The movie should win Oscars in ALL those categories. I can honestly say the first half of this movie is like nothing you've ever seen! And it is undescribable. All I have to say is it took a huge, vivid imagination. Of course, you have to watch "MR" with an open mind. Let your imagination run wild! Especially when you have modern songs being sung in 1900 France. There's even a scene where everybody in the club starts singing "Smells Like Teen Spirit" by Nirvana. Just like I said about "A Knight's Tale" scenes like that are totally innaccurate--historically speaking--but they're great to look at. Speaking of things that are great to look at, Nicole Kidman couldn't have looked more beautiful! If you see some of her outfits in this movie--WOW! It's beyond comprehension. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sang great, and it was nice to find out they used their real voices--I at least assumed McGregor might've been lip-synching. On a musical level, this film works out splendidly, working in many modern hit songs into the soundtrack that will keep you singing along. However, I was disappointed by the second half. The first half is so upbeat, so in-your-face and gets your mood so pumped up. Then the film suddenly takes a dramatic turn. It takes on a dreary tone, and I felt quite uneasy about the transition. When you have a spectacular opening like this, it's hard getting adjusted to a more quiet, downbeat, depressing tone. I had a hard time keeping myself awake! But I have to say, that climax with the gun is very creative and I got a kick out of that. The first half of "MR" is so striking and original that I have to give it a recommendation. It's blend of great music, fast pacing, unrelenting energy, humor, sexual innuendos and beautiful visuals will keep you captivated! In the second half, you might want to go out for popcorn. Some may appreciate the sad tone towards the end and will squeak a few tears, but I had a hard time dealing with the transition. For that, I will let you use discretion. My score: 7 (out of 10) </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely unoriginal garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I walked into the theater, I did so with an open mind; I was ready for something different.Then the film actually started.At first, I was impressed with the surrealistic flyovers of Paris, but that's where my engrossment with the film ended. I became quickly annoyed with the rapid succession of all-too-quick shots and bizarre camera angles; these techniques work well when used to accentuate a point in an otherwise normal film, but here they merely numb the mind.When Ewan McGregor began singing "The Sound Of Music," I was hit with the other major annoyance in the film: the complete and utter lack of a single original song. The film is supposed to be a musical, yet in a musical the lyrics of the music serve to advance the story and provide insight into the characters' condition. Here, the characters regurgitate bits and pieces of songs everyone is all too familiar with in a kitschy mashed-together style that ultimately becomes too confused and never manages to make a discernable point.The movie tries to be an expression of originality by using an all-too-garish color scheme and some extremely bold cinematic techniques, but in the end it comes across as frenetic and terribly unoriginal. It is most likely aimed at the type of person who enjoys such unoriginality, and here it succeeds, as evidenced by the dozens of reviews here entitled "Spectacular Spectacular."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit Moulin Rouge is visually stunning, but beyond yet it can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy, musical or melodrama. The first half of the movie is filmed at a frenetic pace. The style is a cross between Tim Burton and Spike Jonze on speed. It had all the drama of an hour-long music video (the Smashing Pumpkins did it better). The characters are cartoonish and too slapstick. The second half of the movie plays better, but it left me wondering why the whole movie wasn't treated as a serious love story. The usually entertaining John Leguizamo's Toulouse Lautrec is Three Stooges in its depth.Moulin Rouge is better suited for the Broadway stage, then for the movie screen. Ewan McGregor does hold his own, unlike Antonio Banderas in Evita (or who could forget Oliver Reed in Tommy) and Nicole Kidman is absolutely beautiful. Even these great performances can't rescue Moulin Rouge. Too often avant-garde is synonymous with greatness. The audience I saw this movie with was bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One colossal little love story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The vivid, vibrant, highly graphic strokes and style of French impressionist Toulouse-Lautrec was inspired by the colorful night life of the Montmartre district of Paris -- the circuses, the brothels(!), but notably the Moulin Rouge cabaret which he frequented often and became a routine host to an elite, partygoing bunch of artistic intellects and deviants. Were he alive today, he could very well have been reinspired by this ambitious recreation of the Moulin Rouge 100 years later. A mammoth, toyingly libidinous piece of escapism to be certain, the painter would simply revel in the outre, over-the-top, visually assaultive mind of its creator writer/director Baz Luhrmann.I, too, was quite bowled over by this "everything but the kitchen sink" extravaganza, although not always as ecstatically as I would have wanted to be, but certainly enough to appreciate the intentions of this masterful deluge of gaudy Gallic grandeur circa 1899.Refreshingly original (the previews had me fooled), what did NOT race through my categorical mind while experiencing this film! In its initial stage, the love story seemed to borrow its concept directly from Christopher Isherwood's "Berlin Stories," specifically the Sally Bowles "Cabaret"-inspired chapter in which a naive, struggling writer recalls (via his typewriter) his doomed love affair with a capricious entertainer who got caught up in the phony glitz and decadent glamour around her. But from then on, it was anybody's guess. A potpourri of other musical shows and films flashed through my mind --from the typical (Jose Ferrer's "Moulin Rouge," "Can-Can," "Les Girls," "An American in Paris") to the more imaginative and surreal ("Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band," "Blade Runner," "Fellini Satyricon," Fosse's "All That Jazz," the phantasmagorical "Yellow Submarine", anything Gilbert &amp; Sullivan-ish, and Disney's "Aladdin"). Don't even ask me why on some of these.Nicole Kidman's Satine could have easily been based on the life of the indelible French star Renee Adoree, a one-time circus performer who became a Folies Bergere dancer. She subsequently was ushered to Hollywood and illuminated one classic love story, "The Big Parade" with John Gilbert, that remains a silent screen treasure. A frail beauty, Renee died in her mid-30s of tuberculosis/consumption.Once the incessant battering by the camera's eye took a breather and I was allowed to actually focus on something tangible -- like the love story -- I found the enticing, highly photogenic Kidman, coupled with Ewan McGregor's honest-guy Christian, to be quite affecting as a pair, even moving. And that wasn't easy. The visual bombardment and gimmicky use of modern songs constantly threaten to isolate the viewer from the film's emotional core. Fortunately, it did not succeed.Speaking of, the use of contemporary pop and classic rock songs worked better at the beginning when it was a novelty but, of course, the pattern eventually wore out its welcome as I started spending my time ingenously thinking about what next classic hit should be used for the present scene -- much like the so-so musical "Mamma Mia!" wherein a series of Abba songs are thrown together (very weakly) to create a ridiculous storyline. I thought the "Material Girl" number (despite the engaging presence of Jim Broadbent's bombastic impresario, Zidler, and Richard Roxburgh's oily villain, the Duke of Worchester) was stretching a potential good idea too far. However, Kidman's breathy song stylings and, especially, McGregor's sturdy pop tenor handled the love songs quite effectively.As for the handling of simple little love stories, however, I sincerely hope Luhrmann doesn't get any ideas by setting his sights on a remake of "The Fantasticks." I don't think the fragile little story could take it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, this one was bad. Perhaps that straya loser Baz worst film, even though he does not have plenty of, even decent work on his career, and it was premiered in Cannes? This guy must have balls of steel because Moulin Rouge literally gives the finger to France and its culture. McGregor was good, but as the film goes along, he lowers himself to act in a bad way, so over the top, Kidman, bad as always, the rest of the cast were good though. The writing is the weakest link, it has more cheesy and corny lines than Amelie and the second act drags so much the film gets boring, not to say, like most of Hack Lurhmann or whatever movies, does not have a proper tone. It begins with 'quirky' annoying humor, if I can call it humor and not a try hard attempt of it, then dissolves into a romantic tragedy, you know why, the bitch dies at the beginning of the movie, very good way to go, Lurhmann. Just a overrated mess, not even worthy of being even nominated for the MTV Movie Awards. Skip it, you won't miss anything</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yikes! And I thought the Titanic was a disaster!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not quite sure where to begin. Was is the lack of original score? The lack of original dialog? The miscasting of most of the supporting cast? The really bad editing? The horrific "story"? Lets start with the score. I am not sure how they got permission to ruin so many good songs by including them in this movie. At least there could have been some effort to slip in some original lines in some of these songs. But why be original, that might require some thought or effort.And the dialog is a string of many good lines (and some bad ones) from a wide collection of songs, movies, poems, and bumper stickers. If I was the writer, I would have used a pen name, because nobody would have given me work after this.I like John Leguizamo, but what the heck? And what was with casting people who cannot sing in a musical? Were all the talented people doing something else? Or maybe they just read the script first. I didn't know that Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor needed work this bad.Maybe the editing wasn't really that bad. Perhaps the editor just needed to cover up the really bad script, the inconsistent cinematography, and the sheer lack of talent involved in the production of this film. If the editor of this film didn't drink before, I am sure he does now.And what is the point of the story? That no matter how hard you try for true love, everything will end horribly. I know, maybe the point was to see exactly what the audience would tolerate before burning down the theater.I am still a little speechless after seeing this. Stupid film class.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shades of Rocky Horror in very clever musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can't watch this film without comparing it to THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, and how much you like one is probably how much you'll like the other. It is a stunning musical with bold in your face camera work that is expertly spliced to give the full effect. The story is the basic boy meets girl, which is refreshing in this day of movies in which boy already owns girl. Finally, a throwback to what a film should be. True romance. This movie is for those who are free of spirit so to speak, and possibly not enjoyed as much by the one who is satisfied with the status quo. This film takes chances. It explores, and it takes you on a journey with each separate frame. A lot of the songs are mainstays of pop, refitted and modified. They take some of the lesser pop songs (Roxanne, Like a Virgin), and improve them greatly. These are possibly the best cover songs you will ever hear. I only saw it twice, so I cannot discern the minor characters, but I could tell they were there, and while it will take me more viewings to see how logical they are, it is obvious they are cinematic and work artistically. The main characters are all very entertaining. The hero is a throwback to the old Hollywood era, and is remarkably charismatic. The heroine seems to be a direct spin off of Madonna herself, and the performance is superb. She isn't a natural beauty, but has glitz and glamour galore. The head bad guy is a riot, and it's a toss up as to whether he or the minor characters steal the show. The henchman is more of a force and face, and rarely speaks, but he is very well done. The master of ceremonies has the broadest range written into his lines, and he doesn't disappoint. The music is all spectacular. The scenery is spectacular. The characters have the cult film quality of stereotypes who evolve into characters. This has all the makings of a cult classic if it catches on. Again, the music is very moving and awesome. I gave it an initial 8, but as time goes on and I see it again, and if the cult quality remains, I'll probably raise that rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This production received SO much press and promotion that I almost passed on seeing it. In retrospect, I'm glad I didn't do that.This is one of those movies, which knows it's a movie. There are several scenes in which the characters look directly into the camera and pop off their one liner. It works well here, though.While this work is replete with clichés and the dialog is particularly trite in spots, the production itself is really quite lovely. As far as musicals go, this is one of my favorites, and this version of it is probably the best of the 6 versions I've seen.Nicole Kidman is, as usual, wonderful in this role. Even her movies I haven't liked, I've always thought she gave it her all, and the movie wasn't lacking because of her.All in all, this work was very enjoyable; tragic, but lovely.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Baz Luhrmann does it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again Baz Luhrmann has concocted a predictable, sappy and contrived kaleidoscope of images, wrapped them up in contemporary pop music and tried to pass it off as high class art. All the talent is there, Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidmann, John Leguizamo, but Luhrmann is so incessant on producing a film that is seen as cutting edge and original that what follows is a prime example of style over substance. Ironically, in Luhrmann's strive to be original, he has given the audience a text book lesson in what happens when media becomes so inbred. Using contemporary pop music already composed and already used for lord knows how many television commercials must be Luhrmann's 'edge' in his attempt to bring the musical in to current cinema but in the end just seems lazy and wreaks of effort. It is one thing to have different musicians compose songs for the film itself, but using songs that are already popular just reminds one of all the annoying car and soft drink commercials that permanently ruin songs that at one time were cherished. With all due credit, the cinematography is very well done and the acting is definitely above par. The film could have really worked if perhaps the director was someone that wasn't so concerned about appearing artsy for artsy sake and maybe concentrated on telling a story that wasn't so predictable and full of clichés. Many people I have talked to about this film usually give the same comment, "I haven't seen a movie made like this for a long time" (even though the theme is the oldest and most tired vehicle for storytelling in Hollywood history) and I answer with the obvious,"There is a reason for that" or, "Thank god for that!" even though, to the degree that Moulon Rouge is at best unsavory, it is a dime a dozen in the Hollywood machine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just read a large number of the other comments, by people who loved the film, and by those that thought it was awful, you can see something of a pattern emerge. Most of the people who thought it was awful don't connect with the style of the film, and given that it has such an in-your-face style, if you don't connect there, then I can well imagine that you'd find it boring, frenetic, lame, etc, etc.It is worth observing at the outset, that the style is very much that of opera - melodramatic, hyper-real, fantastic (as in "fantasy", rather than "really good"). I enjoy this style myself, but I can readily believe other people disliking it intensely.One common objection by people who disliked it is that either the film has no plot, or that the plot is not original. The plot is there, and it is essentially the same story used in several operas of the 19th century, and more than one musical of the 20th. The important insight that helps one understand this film, is that in a well honored tradition stretching back to Homer, the plot is not the "point" of the work, but rather the scaffolding on which the story-telling occurs. In opera, it is most unusual to walk in to the theater without already knowing the plot. Homer's "Odessy" and "Iliad" are both stories that would have been known by his audience. In both cases, the cleverness, the art, is in how the story is told. Moulin Rouge! is very much opera for the big screen, and it is built on this conception of story-telling. So, yes, it is style over substance, and deliberately so.That said, if a plot is to be successful scaffolding to tell an engaging story, then it has to have some bones to it. This classic story of the consumptive courtesan who falls in love has lots of song themes in it about what is important in life, life's fleeting nature, and so on. Where the film loses many people, who haven't connected to the operatic style, is that having communicated enough bits of the plot to tell us which story is being told (and the bookend structure tells us that right away), there is no obligation to join all the dots. Having given us the message that it is *this* story, it can skip over the details of the plot in order to concentrate on which ever aspects of the telling it likes.This is clear in how the snatches of song are used. The goal is evocation rather than elucidation.Anyway, enough criticism.I recommend this film, not because I can predict whether it will be to your taste or not, but because it is an excellent example of a very different style of story-telling to what we usually see in film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I particularly enjoyed this movie because of it's very good fusion of modern songs. Nicole Kidman is a surprisingly good singer, and thats the same to say about Ewan McGregor. They seem like an weird team when you first hear they'll be starring together, but they have awesome screen chemistry. The beginning makes it look like a weird Gothic-esquire depressing story, but it turns out to be a beautiful bittersweet love story. Kidman never ceases to amaze with her vocal range, and it's just plain amazing McGregor can even sing. Ewan McGregor is Obie Wan Kenobe, and you certainly wouldn't expect a Star Wars Jedi to be able to sing AND act. Bravo. By the way: The writers should all really think hard about why they made Satine die. You guys suck for making me cry in front of my boyfriend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mad world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann's 'Romeo + Juliet' was a brilliant blend of Shakespeare and a decidedly modern sensibility. 'Moulin Rouge!', that film's successor, is a less-grounded and rather more self-indulgent affair, a voracious monster that gobbles up just about every influence it can lay its hands and spits them out as a spectacle of sound and noise so overwhelming that at times it seems that the screen can barely contain it. Luhrmann's interweaving of fragmented images and songs is dizzying and dazzling and very self-aware, delighting in its deliberate anachronisms. The editing is perhaps the most manic yet seen in cinema, which sometimes supports but at other time smothers some the film's nicest tricks, like the deft choreography (and not just in the dance numbers) that were one of the pleasures of 'Romeo + Juliet'. One could hardly call it monotone, but one can almost for just a little bit of metaphorical black-and-white to offset the extravagant colour.Ewan MacGregor does his usual stuff, Nicole Kidman is excellent in the most demanding role and I also enjoyed the relatively understated performance of Richard Roxburgh as the malevolent Duke. The plot resembles that of 'Shakespeare in Love' (which of course was also based on Romeo and Juliet), and also contains a definite nod to 'Strictly Ballroom', Luhrman's breakthrough feature. There are also no original songs, the joke lies the way that the familiar is recycled into something shiny and new (and if you've seen the film, you'll get the allusion in that last sentence). Yet the fact the soul of the film is so well reflected in pop songs also indicates a certain level of triteness. For all its pomp and magnificence, when the hero and heroine sum up their tale in a simple chorus, you're left with the feeling that there really hasn't been anything deeper than this at any point in the movie.You can file this film along with 'South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut' as a modern attempt at revitalising the big screen musical. 'Moulin Rouge' is certainly amazing; but the fact that you're unlikely to see another film like it is probably something of which you'll be glad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>moulin rouge review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luhrmann succeeds again!Luhrmann's fourth film will leave you utterly exhausted. The fast paced in your face dance routines and song performances are truly 'spectacular'. Moulin Rouge set in Paris 1900 mixes the high-class gentleman with second rate artists, bohemians and courtesans.The film sees Christian (Ewan McGregor - Little voice, Down With Love) a young talented poet move to Paris in search of fame as a writer. He becomes entangled in a group of bohemians where he experiences the diverse magical world of the Moulin Rouge. Employed by the bohemian's, Christian begins writing his first play, which they intend to perform at the club, Moulin Rouge. Toulouse (John Leguizamo - Romeo and Juliet) the leader of the group pretends to set up a meeting with Satine (Nicole Kidman - The Hours), the main courtesan of the club and Christian. His intentions are to sell the play. Meanwhile Zidler (Jim Broadbent - Bridget Jones's Diary) the owner of the club has set up a real meeting for the Duke (Richard Roxenburgh - Mission: Impossible II), a promising investor of the club, and Satine. When Satine mistakes Christian for the duke, he becomes besotted with her and madly in love. She explains that she can't fall in love because she is a courtesan, but eventually her feelings prevail.The everyday plot of 'will love out do evil?' is a common convention of the musical genre, but some how you seem to forget this while watching. Luhrman's direction has exceeded again, leaving you gob smacked by its constant mirage of colour and fantasy-like scenes. The use of 20th century music re-mixes such as 'Like a Virgin' and 'Roxanne' are successfully integrated within the plot, expressing the characters' feelings well. The contrast between its time period and imaginative song selection, give an original flavour to the film.Another ingredient to the films impressive overview, is its phenomenal set and costume. Although the main characters are lower class the piece somehow proclaims class and glamour throughout.The casting, which is somewhat unexpected, is exceptionally fulfilling. I was surprised to see Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor in a musical genre but their talent as performers and singers were outstanding. The chemistry between the pair leaves you emotionally attached, which unless you have no feelings at all will be expressed at the end of the film. I think any hatred for the character Duke will advance to sympathy. You begin to feel quite sorry for him because you get to see how lonely his character becomes.Baz Luhrmann is known for his curious fantasy like films and compared to his others, this one is no exception. Enticed by its prominent story telling structure, Luhrmann takes you into his world for roughly 127 minutes to experience an intoxicating love story, which will have you singing along to all your favourite songs!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an interesting film, set in the early 20th century but using late 20th century music. Starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, both prove that they can carry a tune. Neither is a great singer but both do well enough. Once the film gets started, it can hold the viewer's interest pretty well. The story has been reviewed several times over by others so I'll not go into it much here, but suffice it to say it's a musical that's mainly a love story. It has elements of comedy and tragedy but doesn't completely fit in either genre. There is an underlying theme, which is "the show must go on" as well as the main love story. All in all, pretty good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic music video</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet uses a pop exterior to bring Shakespeare's rich dialogue to moviegoers who never would have sought it out. Characters are successfully translated, so that the audience can identify with them. The colorful presentation makes it fun to watch. Shakespeare's story makes this film easily rewatchable, especially in the modern context.Luhrman's Moulin Rogue! has flashy presentation AND pop music. But the story feels thin and stretched. It must compete for time with the (amazingly arranged) music, eye candy, and comical scenes. The underlying story is romance vs. pragmatism, and the challenge of whether or not love can conquer all did have me thinking about the ending two days later (a sign of a good story).I was blown away by the rooftop love-song duet. Having rented it the first time, I bought the DVD several months later. And found the film as a whole not very rewatchable. The music is still quite good though; I wish that there were an easier way to just play the songs, other than skipping through the chapters.The leads both did a good job getting us to identify with their characters, with the few serious scenes they had together. For instance, Nicole does a good job on the rooftop scene with eye contact, to show internal conflict, to help us believe she could still fall in love. They were obviously convincing, or the ending wouldn't have moved me so much.Expect a music video movie (as in Graffiti Bridge), and you won't be disappointed. You will also be rewarded with a bit more, in the story and setting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christian (Ewan McGregor) a talent young writer defies his wealthy father by moving to Montmartre Paris to live the life of a Bohemian. On the night of his arrival, he's taken to the Moulin Rouge, a wild nightclub that caters to the rich and powerful. There he meets Satine (Nicole Kidman) the Sparkling Diamond and star of the Moulin Rouge. Then in a twist of events, Christian lands a job at the Moulin Rouge, as the writer of Spectacular Spectacular. From the first night they meet, sparks fly between Christian and Satine, and by the time rehearsals really start you can tell this isn't just a small fling, it's deep meanful love. Now, I saw this movie the first weekend it came out in theatres, and that was two years ago (2001). Since then I have seen it probably about 20 times (don't ask why I'm only writing a comment now). Everything about this movie is brilliant, the costumes, the sets, the music and the story. But the best thing is the acting. The chemistry between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman is phenomenal, they really sell the fact that they are in love through their singing and emotional performances. Another amazing thing is the way the two actors take their characters and help them grown up through out the coarse of the movie. We first see Ewan as the innocent and naive Christian who arrives in Paris with his idealistic youthful ideas of love, but towards the end of the film he changes Christian into a more mature man who has been scarred by losing something he loved very dearly, he makes you really feel the pain he's in. Nicole makes Satine an ambitious and do-anything-it-takes star who has men melting at her feet at the beginning of the movie, but then turns her into this vulnerable and desperate (and dying) woman who just wants to be loved. Another thing that I love about this film is how the whole cast (not just Ewan and Nicole) transmit on to the screen how much fun they all had making this movie. Which makes it even more enjoyable to watch. I know that this kind of movie doesn't appeal to everyone, but I guarantee that if you were to give it a try and sit through some of the more weirder parts, by the end of the it you'll be saying: "Now that was a good movie."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlike anything you've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening moments of this movie were a bit disorienting, as I was swept into a world and a film unlike any other I'd ever experienced. But I kept in mind that Baz Luhrman simply doesn't make normal movies (See other work 'Strictly Ballroom' and 'Romeo &amp; Juliet'), but rather audio-visual extravaganzas. The music is what carries the film as the quirky pop adaptations, although odd at first, work very well and mesh seamlessly with the equally high-caliber original music. In fact this is the rare film that, while nothing quite compares to a theatrical viewing, is as good on DVD. I attribute this to the music. Like listening to a favorite CD over and over, 'Moulin Rouge!' is an enjoyable two hours time and time again, and the music will stay with you for even longer. But unlike many movie musicals, the music here advances the story along, rather than simply providing melodious entertainment. It also enhances the story by displaying a greater depth of emotion than most mere words are capable of expressing. As for the vocal qualities, I found it quite refreshing to listen to the actual singing voices of the cast. Kidman, McGregor, and others supplied their own vocals, which was a fantastic change from the typical pre-packaged pop or opera sounds. Tough movie to describe, but in a sentence, it's a flashy, fast-cutting, moving-camera, music-drenched portrayal of a love story set within a modern turn of last century nightclub. Bottom Line: Every year there are two or three movies that genuinely get me excited about what can be done with and through film. 'Moulin Rouge' was one of those in 2001. Top Five of the year. 8.5/10</fullReview>

The very beginning was confusing, but once they got to the Moulin Rouge, it started getting good. The story was great. For those that didn't like this, how about paying attention and you might change your mind. This isn't just some MTV video. It had a great love story with a sad ending. The use of the all the pop songs added to the story and were even funny like the "Like a Virgin" number. Both lead actors were great. I was surprised Nicole Kidman didn't win the oscar. And Ewan McGregor should have been nominated. Both sang well also.(SPOILERS): My favorite part is when Christen is in Satine's room to give his poetry reading and she thinks he is the duke. Satine keeps talking about the "naughty words" and carrying on like that. That was so funny, I couldn't stop laughing. Then, I loved the "Your Song" number and the "Spectular, Spectular" song and dance that came shortly thereafter.FINAL VERDICT: This is a great movie and a great love story.

		<fullReview>A film that carries you away. The costumes, sets, songs and story. Some cannot suspend their belief enough to enjoy the film, or might nitpick on the music authenticity.There were a few things I didn't like though. Much of the film were done with the quick edit style of today's MTV video. I found those distracting, even if it to apply today's music video style.I don't want every movie made this way, but it is good to watch something once in a while that takes you away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I want to be Nicole Kidman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It's original, innovative, stunning to look at and spectacularly entertaining. It also allows Nicole Kidman to showcase a wonderful array of talents. Funny, sexy and heartbreakingly tragic she sings, dances, falls in love and all in the most amazing costumes. McGregor provides solid back up as the romantic poet and writer, whilst Jim Broadbent is his excellent self as Harold Zidler, the Moulin Rouge's owner. His version of Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' is a comic highlight. Only John Leguizamo (as Toulouse Lautrec) didn't quite work for me. But this all pales into insignificance when Kidman is on the screen. She dominates the movie like a Hollywood diva of yesteryear. I know this isn't the sort of movie that usually wins Oscars but what more does a girl have to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to watch this film twice before I could get my baring and decide. Watching Moulin Rouge! For the first time was like getting hit by a Mac truck then taking a roller coaster ride afterwards. This film is unique and like no other I have ever seen before (gilbert and Sullivan come close in the PP). There is so much eye/ear candy in this movie that I did not have time to absorb or enjoy it all. The last time I saw this much energy in a music/movie was "Stop Making Sense" (1984) you stare in disbelief at the wattage expended. The second time I watched Moulin Rouge! I enjoyed it. I have mixed feelings about most of the dialogue coming from other song lyrics. I watch older films and listen to older music and enjoyed picking out several lines from these films and songs. Since many young movie goers may not realize this, it will pass over their heads unnoticed. Such reuse is not a new concept and is enjoyable if done well, camp if forced. When the reuse was well-integrated, it was magical but there is a couple of gear grinding moments ("Like a Virgin" needs work). Over all, 96% of the music was well integrated and awesome. The cinematography, costumes and choreography make this a visually stunning event. With uncommon movies like Moulin Rouge! that can't be easily categorized, people will either love or hate this movie. I fall into the love faction. The plot is simple and fanciful but who quotes "War and Peace" on a roller coaster? In defense the plot does have an ending not typical of the sappy "happy ending" one expects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoy [most] operas when I choose to attend them. Perhaps the reason I enjoy them, but not this pseudo-opera puke-frenzy, is that I can take in the scenes and enjoy them rather than be dizzied with gratuitous and intrusive editing. This film hints that it contains incredible visuals, but it never lingers long enough to permit verification. I just remember the color RED! This flick will probably kill more than a handful of epileptics.Perhaps it's optimized to be viewed while high. If someone has tried it, please relate the experience...A positive note: the DVD has lots of extras and some cool features to tweak the setup of home theaters and surround-sound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Post-modern? YES Enjoyable? YES Over-the-top? YES Moulin Rouge is an excessive piece of film-making. Make no bones about it this film doesn't break much new ground - It uses old ideas, classic songs and bright colours to throw you into a chaos world. There isn't much to say about the plot, the film is about set pieces, it's loud, everything is big, everything is theatrical.The film is about love! The first part of the picture is interesting but so damn excessive, it's all a bit too much. 100 shots in 1 minute is headache-inducing! Tailor made for the Mtv generation!The film does work despite the post-modern ideas. I think the eye-popping features have to be the extraordinary sets! There's so much detail, without it, the film would be flushed down the toilet!The acting is okay, only Jim Broadbent really shows the class. Nicole Kidman is very sexy, fits into the world perfectly. Ewan is okay but seems a bit lost with the material.The direction is hyper-active, it lacks subtleness. Where the film does not work is the MTV editing, it's rubbish. There's no need to edit like this, it's worse than Michael's Bay cutting. Just because you can edit so quick doesn't mean you should. I know that the director wanted the film to be hyper but please! Where's the control?The use of classic songs sang in operatic fashion is quite fun, I don't think I've ever seen it done like this before.Overall, Moulin Rouge is entertaining but lacks a strong story, I guess it's all about the experience!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the type of movie that I am usually predisposed to dislike -- an overhyped production that starts off as a mess, which Moulin Rouge definitely does. While the first 15 minutes of the film are almost unintelligible, they are visually stunning, and that was enough to keep me going. After quite a while, the actual plot appears, and while it's hardly original, it provided a good framework upon which to hang all the rest of the weirdness that follows.An ensemble cast performs magnificently and that's the real attraction of Moulin Rouge. Nicole Kidman redeems herself here as Santine, the courtesan with a heart of gold -- she's truly stunning, both as an actress and a vocalist. Ewan MacGregor surprises me with his earnestness, vitality, and naivete as Christian, the young writer. Jim Broadbent deserves his Oscar nomination as Zidler, the complicated proprietor of the Moulin Rouge. On the other end of the spectrum, the Duke is played as Snidely Whiplash by Richard Roxbourgh with no shadings whatsoever, and John Leguizamo is just ridiculous as Toulouse-Lautrec, affecting both a poor French accent and a ludicrous lisp.However, the use of contemporary music (and mostly old pop songs) bothered me throughout the entire movie. I don't believe that an original piece of music was presented until almost an hour had gone by. Instead, we get several riffs on Elton John, the Beatles, the disco era -- "Voulez-vous couchez avec moi"? Come on. It serves to pull this viewer out of the flow of the story. I didn't really become absorbed until much later on, when the scenery stopped being so intrusive, the quick cuts and speed-up/slow-down effects subsided, and anachronistic songs gave way to some beautiful original work that actually had something to do with the story. The choreography got pretty silly, too, especially toward the beginning.All in all, a visual feast and a belatedly engaging story combine with mostly brilliant performances to deliver a very entertaining film. It's not my favorite, but I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I found most offensive about this film (besides the grotesque faces jumping at me every two seconds, and the icey-chill of that overrated Nicole Kidman) was the way they portrayed Toulouse-Lautrec. If you know anything of the artist, and then see the beautiful portrayal of him in "Moulin Rouge" (the 1952 version) by Jose Ferrer, you can't help but be offended by this new version presenting him as a grinning, hyper, bouncing munchkin who's meant to be a mere sidekick to the mediocre main characters.</fullReview>

I had no clue who directed it, and I searched the IMDb expecting to see the name Terry Gilliam beside the word Director for this movie.(minor spoiler) The use of Nirvana's "smells like teen spirit" in the opening dance number should have Kurt Cobain rolling over in his grave. Everyone else beside me in the theater got up and left approx. 20 minutes into the movie. This is a film you will definitely see on "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Awful, just awful.

		<fullReview>I went to Moulin Rouge two nights ago and paid seven bucks for my movie ticket. Well all I can say is that this was the BIGGEST waist of money I've ever spent on anything. I would have rather burned up that seven bucks then spent it on this awful movie. Okay, from beginning to end, this movie is just completely awful. In fact, it is so terrible that at times it even becomes funny. I could actually tell that this was going to be a really bad movie right when it started. I just got that feeling and I couldn't have been more correct!! The plot is extremely shallow and this movie has absolutely no point to it at all. I think it's just a bunch of boring garbage. I really like Nicole Kidman because I've seen just about all the movies she plays in, and they are all good. But this one is definitely her worst. I like movies that are entertaining and that keep you on the edge of your seat, and this one was FAR from that!! I haven't seen a movie this bad in my whole entire 19 years of existence, bottom line!!</fullReview>

I'm sure this movie wouldn't have gone over very well at all if not for Ewen being such a charming b****rd &amp; some of the goofy, slapstick moments being so crowd pleasing. Still, it's little more than a hyperactive sitcom in the beginning, and a conventional romance in the end. The only thing that sets it apart from the other crap in Hollywood is it's distracting presentation. DISTRACTING at best, never uniquely artistic (as it seems to want you to believe).

		<fullReview>Of all the biographical information a reviewer could give of him/her self, I find myself wishing to know the age of my fellow imdb members. It is because I suspect that the rave reviews for Moulin Rouge come from the very young. They are flattered by the use of pop music and M-TV pacing, and they haven't lived long enough yet to find the "love story" insipid and predictable. Of course the lead actors are pretty much kids them self, and the characters they were playing where probably meant to be no more than 21 themselves. Dance hall girls don't stay fresh looking that long, in that case it is perhaps better to die young. And young bohemian boys go back to London to join Daddy's firm to remember, from time to time, their halcyon days; or they stay artists in Paris, and fall in love with a score of other girls in turn. (Mercury salts were the only effective cure for vererial disease at the time.)Here's a tip, read Hemingway's A Movable Feast, (don't mention it to a soul you know in Hollywood, or Sidney, or London.) There you'll find everything you need to know about Paris 100 years ago, about gossip, betrayal, drunkenness, gambling, infidelity, and a very poor man trying honestly to write. Play the radio at the same time if you think it needs some sound track other than its own. Then take your irony pills and realize that a movie that seeks to flatter you probably does so because it isn't much good in its own right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>&lt;&lt;&lt; Spoilers ahead&gt;&gt;&gt;GOD do I hate Moulin Rouge,why well here is why? The story is set in Paris as a man played by Ewan McGregor falls in love with Satine played by Nicole Kidman(who I swear must be related to Amy Adams I always think there alike)who is a duchess and is hiding a terrible secret(oh and you will be SHOCKED to find out what it is once we're finished)and is caught in some sort of love triangle with another guy. So McGregor's charcther poses as a duke so that he can be close to Satine. They sing songs that we ALL know by heart including all you need is love,a bunch of melodies and the nice song Come What May which was a very good original song. But my only problem with this film is the actual ending and(actually) the WHOLE THING. The songs come out of nowhere,the story is so thin,the effects are good though,but I just don't buy into it for a reason. Also like I said before the ending was so depressing and a bit of a letdown,I mean they KILLED of Nicole Kidman's charcther with a lung disease what the HELL,and we were made to believe that McGregor's charcther and Kidman's charcther were going to live happily ever after after the showcase with their song "Come What May" in the end and before Kidman died,we were made to believe that she was going to be shot and then all of a sudden she just couldn't stop breathing and she fell off in a weakness and died peacefully in McGregor's arms in the end. SERIOUSLY!?!?! what the hell were they thinking of DOING THAT to the audience.The whole movie is just a joke and a piece of utter and complete garbage. The script is horrendous,the acting sucks,the music sucks,EVERYTHING sucks in this movie. I guess me and Doug Walker from the Nostalgia Critic aren't its cup of tea.My advice go out and rent something that's not bad like if you really love musicals go ahead and watch that timeless classic Grease at least that was good and had its OWN original songs compare to this piece of crap.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...is just to love, and be loved in return"."Moulin Rouge!" is my personal favourite musical. "Singin' in the Rain" is arguably the best musical ever made, but nothing touches me more than Baz Luhrmann's masterpiece. "Moulin Rouge!" is a feast for the eyes, heart, ears and soul. It's unapologetically romantic, shamelessly corny, hysterical, sexy, and FUN. The doomed love story of poor writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) and the beautiful courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman) is told by pop songs from the past 2 decades or so, even though the movie is set in Paris, 1899. From David Bowie and Madonna to Elton John and Nirvana, they're all there. McGregor, Kidman, Jim Broadbent and John Leguizamo are all great in their parts, and do their own singing in most of the scenes. Even though "Moulin Rouge!" wasn't an extraordinary box-office hit and got mixed reviews when it first came out in mid-2001, it earned 8 Oscar nominations months later (the Academy, trying to apologize for not nominating Luhrmann for best director, earned his wife, Catherine Martin, two deserved awards - for best costumes and art direction), eventually created a major cult and legion of fans, and officially became the movie that brought the musical genre for the 21st Century. "Chicago" would bring Bob Fosse's genius to the big screen and get 6 Oscars (including Best Picture) the following year, the delightful "Hairspray" and the uninspired "Dreamgirls" got over 100 millions at the box-office last year, and now we can officially say: musicals are popular again. Nobody should forget, though, that Baz Luhrmann's partly responsible for this fortunate comeback. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fell in love with Baz Luhrmann as a director when he released "Romeo and Juliet", and brought a timeless classic to life for a new generation. I was struck by his inventive genius -- I mean, who else would have thought of using the Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart as emblems identifying the Montagues and the Capulets? Yet even that did not prepare me for the bedazzling display of manic energy and glorious excess that is "Moulin Rouge". I saw it again recently on television, and realized just how busy the film is -- almost too much to absorb, a constant assault on the senses.Yet all is not noise and cacophony. There is harmony, too. Take, for instance, the sequence where "Lady Marmelade" and "Entertainer" are seamlessly woven together in a way I have not seen since the Big Band sound merged with soft rock in "Xanadu".Ewan McGregor (as Christian) is the heart and soul of the film, the troubadour of "truth, beauty, freedom, and love". He turns out to have a wonderful singing voice. Who knew? And he is able to deliver the hackneyed clichés with a perfectly straight face, genuine emotion, and touching naivety that makes you want to believe every word.Nicole Kidman (as Satine) pulls off the amazing feat of making you completely forget Marilyn Monroe ever sang "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend". Kidman makes the number all her own. She is the counterpoint to McGregor's lovesick swain -- a turn-of-the-century Material Girl.But the true genius of "Moulin Rouge" lies, not in its visual appeal, not in the acting skill of its principals and supporting cast, but in its bitingly satirical commentary on modern-day popular culture, seen through the lens of turn-of-the-century Paris.Luhrmann uses Christian and Satine as vehicles for an incisive examination of the cynicism and materialism of modern-day society, masked by the false romanticism of popular music and literature. Luhrmann slyly weaves classic song lyrics into the film's dialogue. Once the pleasant shock and surprise of recognition wears off, we realize just how corny they are -- or, more to the point, how jaded we have become."Moulin Rouge" is a movie with a message, and that message is best captured in the words of Sir Paul McCartney: Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs. And what's wrong with that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge. One of the hardest pieces of cake to bite when writing about. It's the musical aura, and the thing of talking about matters so obvious that they used to just slip away usually. A story of love and a force which when gets a hold of somebody, always wins. Death that is. All in a sound stage, all colourful, one moment an usual Hollywood, LA production, another moment European, or Eastern Seaboard heritage. A man falls in love with a courtesan. And when love is for the highest bidder there is no trust. Without trust there can be no love. There can be a broken heart though. When the final clash comes she... well you'd better see for yourself. The soundtrack's great. Ewan and Nicole doing their best to good effect. The supporting staff keeps up the pace. My fellow countryman is great too, singing 'Roxanne', and dancing a fantastic tango and mimicking narcoleptic attacks (with minor credibility). For me it's the unique case of a movie which everyone must watch and find oneself in there. The outstanding music score (U2's Bono and Sir Elton John also involved) and actors' performance make no snag.</fullReview>

Much of it is rather frenetic and grotesque, but no one can accuse it of lacking a colorful stylized life of its own. The best performance comes from Roxburgh as The Duke--excellent job.It will appeal to fans of Kidman and McGregor but is certainly not the sort of musical suited to everyone's taste.</fullReview>

Also John Leguiziamo gives one of his worst performances (and that's saying something). The movie has just two pluses--the truly stunning visuals and McGregor gives out a very good performance--and what a beautiful singing voice! He ALMOST saves the movie. Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ladies and Gentlemen of the film going public of 2001. If you remember one thing I tell you today, remember this: see Moulin Rouge.If Mercutio can do ecstasy with Romeo and sing disco songs in drag, then why can't a love story set in Paris of 1899 be a splashy rock opera with 80's and 90's pop songs? Director Baz Luhrmann showed his flair for anachronism with his 1996 adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, and uses it as the heart and soul of his latest film, Moulin Rouge.Satine (Nicole Kidman) is a beautiful courtesan and star dancer of the decadent Paris nightclub. She is conned by artist Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo, kneeling inside prosthetic legs to make him look shorter) into seducing a ruthless and powerful Duke, convincing him to back a musical written by a fledgling writer, Christian (Ewan McGregor). The Duke agrees, but at a price, Satine is to be his and only his. Faster than you can say Stephen Sondheim, Satine falls in love with the Christian, after being wooed by his genius poetry (actually, lyrics from songs by David Bowie, U2, Paul McCartney and Wings, among others). Luhrmann keeps the story moving at break-neck speed, switching back and forth from Busby Berkeley-styled musical numbers, romantic melodrama, and the high camp of French comedy. The effects can be emotionally distancing (as most musicals are), since there is twice as much singing as there is dialogue. But what Moulin Rouge lacks in character development, it more than makes up for with earnest performances and sumptuous visuals. Kidman's timeless beauty and McGregor's energy bring charm to their stock characters. As visual stylist, Luhrmann has few peers (the Coen Brothers and Lars von Trier among them). His use of visual effects, camera moves and editing, steam roll through what would be static, expository moments in a film by a lesser director. The costumes, sets and elaborately choreographed and photographed dance numbers, make Moulin Rouge like nothing you're likely to see this summer, or this year. A strange hybrid of Cabaret and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, where lascivious nightclub patrons sing Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and grown men wrap themselves in makeshift veils to sing Madonna's "Like A Virgin."Some of what I've said in this review may not make sense to you. But take my word, about Moulin Rouge. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my Top Ten's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had avoided seeing Moulin Rouge simply because I heard that it was a "musical". I soon seem to forget that I DO in fact like "musicals" (Wizard of Oz, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory). So, for a year, I avoided the movie altogether. If it weren't for a good friend of mine INSISTING on seeing the movie, I probably would have missed out on this wonder! I am so glad I listened. I never knew how talented Ewan McGregor was (I am now a HUGE fan, he is adorable!), and though I have always loved Miss Nicole, she was stunning throughout the movie. My favorite scene is the duet they have in the elephant (the first of many). I have never been sucked into a movie like this one. You feel what they feel. You "feel" their love, and sorrow. Its beautifully done. I was very upset when Nicole Kidman did not win the Academy Award for this film. The acting is believable and ALL of the singing IS done by those starring and NOT dubbed. Everyone who worked on this film put their hearts and souls into it, and it shines through. It opened me up to at least try on a few other musicals (Chicago, which I didn't like), and I am always looking for another film to make me feel like I did when I watch Moulin Rouge for the first time. I am highly looking forward to the release of "Across the Universe" this summer. If you had doubts about seeing this film, try it out. You won't be sorry that you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>so many people i know really liked this movie. unfortunately, i am not one of them. but at least i know why, too much. baz luhrmann, brilliant director, a visionaire, i just wish he knew when to say when. my impression of this film was that he felt the need to take every cool idea he ever had and put them all in the same movie. as a result of this overkill i found it difficult to pay attention to what was going on because i never really knew what was the intended center of attention, as opposed to extraneous contributions. had there been half as much...crap in this movie i would have loved it. it has a great story, it is a brilliant idea, and an amazing cast. unfortunately when all put together, with about a dozen other factors of equal intensity, it is overkill. like wearing plaid and polka-dots...and then putting a bright red bow on your head.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Nicole Kidman Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, this is the movie Nicole Kidman was born to play. I could not see anyone else do it; I mean, who knew she could sing. Ewan McGregor accentuates her performance and creates a role any guy would want to live through; I know I can't watch without saying his lines with him. In the movie, a young writer (McGregor) falls for a courtesan (Kidman) in a bawdy bordello/dance hall after she confuses him for a Duke. To cover, she gets her employer to put on his play created in tandem with Toulouse-Latrec (John Leguizamo at his most eccentric). Modern day love songs from the Beatles to Marilyn Monroe to Madonna litter the plot with curious abandon and the play mirrors and shadows the plot of the movie itself so much they they become intertwined. There's "Three's Company" level misunderstandings and cover-ups replete with sexual overtures and enough erotic undertones to choke on (few of the so-called "show girls" are very attractive). Jim Broadbent is Kidman's employer, a sort of whorehouse madam in the form of a father figure, and Richard Roxburgh plays the Duke as a violent psychopath barely contained in the form of a naive idiot. The songs are infectious and the imagery is passing, but the whole pop-song opera style with the romanticism is what makes the movie worth seeing. Kidman and McGregor have such chemistry together that it would make sense to use them together in more movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Moulin Rouge" proves the Mullahs of Iran right -- Hollywood is The Great Satan, spreading its decadent ways around the world, infecting British actors to an Australian director and lead actress, and spending money opulently beyond most countries' GDP.I am second to none in my appreciation of Busby Berkeley musicals, but I never thought them lackluster, or modest and understated. Evidently, Baz Luhrmann does, as his charming opening mis en scene builds up from old black and white movie musicals. His script has the bad guy (the most ineffectual British villain on screen in years) shriek to the Bohemians "I reject your dogma!" and Baz most certainly, most emphatically rejects the Dogma 95 filmmakers of social realism. Baz finds even Ken Russell and Terry Gilliam too tame, though I think at least Russell has also done opera directing as Baz has. The eye-popping MTV Movie Awards production of "Lady Marmalade" was more restrained (and in fact more entertaining and more musical) than how the song is used in the movie. The camera and the editing just never stop; every millimeter of film stock is full and moves.Ewan MacGregor comes out the best; in a total opposite of his "Trainspotting" druggie, here his wide-eyed innocent is sweet even when singing medleys of romantic clichés. (Too bad effective cynical songs about love weren't countered -- I waited in vain for "What's Love Got to Do With It.")Poor Nicole Kidman is simply miscast. Much as Marilyn Monroe imitated Carol Channing's performance in "How To Marry a Millionaire," Nicole must imitate not one, not two, but at least three Madonna videos (from "Material Girl" through to the pseudo-Indian influenced "Ray of Light"). Did Madonna turn down the role as she was busy with Baby #2 and marriage? Did Baz not offer it to her or did the movie moguls think she couldn't fill the seats? The role needs very little acting so would have fit the Courtesan to the World quite well. (I found it amusing that the term courtesan is used every five minutes when the movie "Dangerous Beauty" was re-titled from "The Courtesan" because the producers were convinced audiences wouldn't know what the word meant.) Poor John Leguizamo is as irritating as Jar Jar Binks as a clownish Toulouse Latrec with a lisp; the poor guy has to play a dancing magical sitar. Like "Shrek" and "A Knight's Tale," this is a movie musical with no original music, but highly original use of covers, if most are in pieces and medleys. I particularly liked the version of "Roxanne" as if it were done by Tom Waits in a brothel, while the producers' pitch to the investor paled next to "The Producers." I'm quite sure that the audience was frequently laughing at the film, not with it.Note to movie musical producers -- watch the Tonys and see that there are plenty of talented people around who really do know how to sing and dance.(originally written 6/15/2001)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, if you have read any of my other comments, i usually watch scary, horror, suspense, makes your skin crawl types of movies. Once in a great while, a movie will come along and change all of that. This is that movie. I work at a bank and a young girl who sits next to me was saying how beautiful this movie is and how much she loved it. I told her that musicals are stupid and i would never watch it. Then the movie came out on HBO and Showtime, so i would catch little parts of it in the middle or whatever. it looked really dumb. But please people, GIVE THE MOVIE A CHANCE! one day, i was home sick from work, and i had the TV on a channel. The movie started from the beginning and it was kinda interesting, so i watched. within the first 5 minutes, i was hooked. i had to know what happened to satine... and love... what happens to it? well, this movie is true to the fact that all you need is love, but does love prevail over everything? no, it does not. At the very end, i was so thrilled... i thought it was all going to work out. and i never wish for a happy ending. my idea of a good ending is have everyone die. but then, at the end, i was devastated. i cried and cried and cried. it is so realistic... it is crazy. my husband came home from work early and i was in the bedroom crying hysterically... needless to say, i was not allowed to watch that movie anymore. but, i went out and bought it anyway... so, my advice to you... give yourself a lesson and watch this movie. the best presents come in the strangest packages...</fullReview>

Who could fall in love with a woman who lies to all the men she is with, but a pure hearted man who sees nothing else, the blinding effect of love. It makes you wanna believe in love and mankind. Forget everything you see in the news, but Moulin Rouge, a 2 hour tranquility of hope and love, is all you need. Maybe, it's that wish that we all could live in that world full of revolutionists who strive for our peace, but this movie has made me happy. It's full of hope and youth.

		<fullReview>I too often find people trying to take this movie for something it's not, or criticizing something that's not even there. For example, saying that it ripped off songs when that wasn't why they were used at all. I don't understand how people could possibly be so lacking in common sense. Personally this is my favorite movie. I am not claiming to know all about cinema, I am not claiming it is the greatest movie of all time, simply that I enjoy it very much. I saw it in the theater when it first came out, and I instantly had my breath taken away, and though some of the pacing was fast, I very much wanted to try to keep up and was absolutely in love with the film. I saw it five times in the theater, and I've since watched it quite a few times on DVD. Moulin Rouge is the story of Christian and Satine, a penniless writer and a courtesan. They fall in love in nineteenth century Paris. It was pieced together with many great songs from the twentieth century. This movie was in no way trying to make a new and exciting story, simply trying to tell the story in a new, different, and exciting way, for which I think it did triumphantly. I very highly recommend it, though I know several people who have turned it off because they thought it was moving too fast (I also noticed some people leave the theater), and some others who didn't like the love story because apparently they... don't like and want to admit they have emotions? *coughmyexboyfriendcough* I find this film very moving. Some people I know call it a "chick flick", then giggle and twirl their hair around their finger. Stupid peers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A non-traditional film about traditional idealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann has perfected one of the ADD generation's greatest feats: keep the attention of your audience while not sacrificing plot or character development. The suspension of disbelief that Baz so quickly threw out is not necessary to make us care about his characters, Satine and Christian. He doesn't cop out with a la-dee-da story, where all the characters live happily ever after. We find this out from the get-go when Christian introduces us to the story. At the same time, he doesn't make us think we're seeing a happy story only to surprise us at the end with a tragic surprise (this is also accomplished by Christian's introduction). In short, Baz created a film the only way it can be effectively created: in a way that is both traditional and non-traditional, in that it matches more the Greek tragedy than the Hollywood blockbuster, while at the same time boasting a musical score that includes everything from Fatboy Slim to Elton John to Nirvana. He has a lot of story to cover in a short period of time, and he performs wonderfully.</fullReview>

"Moulin Rouge!" is that kind of movie that you only see once in a lifetime. Jim Broadbent himself says that no one he knows has ever done a movie like this one. "Moulin Rouge!" is a movie, it's true, but it's a SHOW. Completely... Delicious to the eyes, to the ears and to the heart. The music is amazingly touching. As Ewan McGregor says, some of the lines are just to simple to be spoke, they have to be sung, and they turn into something beautiful. The voices of the actors are very good, and adjusted to their personality. All the colour in the costumes and scenaries, turn this movie into a masterpiece. Baz Luhrmann did an amazing job, he achieved something that no other director had ever achieved: Turn a movie into a small little sweet chocolate, that totally praises your heart, and everytime you eat it, you discover something new.Congratulations! =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jon Monsarrat review: perfect romance, musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was put off by the promotions for Moulin Rouge! thinking that the film would be too surreal and weird for me. But it comes across as a musical that's quite interesting and without as many weird segues. You know what I'm talking about; in most musicals the dialogue is going along just fine and then somebody suddenly breaks into song for no reason. Well, in Moulin Rouge it's well-integrated, and the plot is just surreal enough to be arty and interesting without spoiling the mood or becoming campy.For example, the racy modern music they play at the burlesque gives us a feeling of what it might have been like to hear what was considered racy music at the turn of the century. The romance is compelling and sweet, and there are plenty of deep thoughts about the nature of what it means to be human, and to fall in love. It brought tears to my eyes, and that's very rare for me -- I'm hardly a weepy at the films.Who should see this film:-- Romantic comedy lovers -- a must-see, although expect a lot more romance than comedy-- People who are musical -- a must-see-- Everybody elseI'll give this film a sensational 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe Nicole Kidman should have been a singer. She had a beautiful voice, unfortunately, she has no business in front of a camera. Aside from the music, which I honestly believed was spectacular, nothing about this movie struck me as a trait of an earth-shattering masterpiece as it's made out to be. All my friends told me how incerdable it was, however, after having watched it, the only reason they or anyone liked it that I can think of is that they're astounded by colors. Plain and simple, the movie is a jumbled mess of colors swirling around the screen while beautiful music plays in the background. None of the acting is in the least bit redeeming, and sometimes downright embarrassing, the cinematography is often too dizzying to watch, and there is not a single unpredictable plot twist or intended laugh. My friends all cried at the end I was practically shouting that we knew it was going to happen for the past three hours for in the opening scene, we are informed that the woman Christian loved is dead. I didn't spend my four bucks to know what happens five minutes into my movie. Please, Blockbuster, give me my money back, please?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>O.K., this one hurt - my ears, my eyes, my intelligence . . . Five minutes into it, you've pretty much seen it. My husband and I did, however, stick it out to the end because his sister had told us we would love it. As a matter of fact, she said it would break her heart if we didn't. Oh boy. We just put off mentioning we had seen it as long as we could. Apparently, this film causes a visceral love/hate reaction in viewers, and obviously, we didn't fall into the "love" category. I admire the idea and the effort but was numbed by the product--a triumph of editing and sound, I guess, but all to an incredibly annoying result. Mostly I just wanted it to STOP. What astounds me is that the score has won two major awards already!!! I realize there are some original things in it, but surely that is not what sticks in one's memory. I like Ewan McGregor and can tolerate Nicole Kidman (though the "wronged woman making an valiant comeback" schtick is getting old).

The spectacle, pace, eye candy, sheer entertainment make it hard to classify.As important as the plot is, this film upholds the best traditions of 'American Musical' - just enough story to hold together the music and show numbers.But I digress.

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Ever moulin rouge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Moulin Rouge is the most amazing movie ever. Its my favorite movie. The songs Are fantastic and i have been singing them in my head all day. Christian (Ewan McGregor), a gifted writer with an idealistic outlook on love, sets off for Paris . He moves into a lowly tenement right across from the notorious nightclub that is the Moulin Rouge, where girls do the can-can... and more. It is here where Christian befriends a dwarfish Toulouse (John Leguizamo), who wants to put on a musical production to further the Bohemian movement. He wants Christian to write it and have the most beautiful and famous star of the Moulin Rouge, Satine (Nicole Kidman), to play the lead. The ever-so-romantic Christian falls madly in love with Satine, but things get complicated when the wealthy financial duke of the production wants Satine for himself. Satine is torn between the two, but like a true actress, she knows that the show must go on.From the trailers, one would not think that "Moulin Rouge" is a comedy, but in fact, most of the film is. I was very much surprised how well this worked for the film, not only because we knew the lyrics and could sing silently to ourselves, but also these songs fit the situations perfectly. I was totally absorbed by the film's amusing absurdity. There were original numbers written for the film, which were also good, but it will be the ones that are recognized that will be remembered. Nicole Kidman was great as Satine, and I also admired Ewan McGregor's performance. Credit is to be given to anybody who can act as well as Kidman. Despite a bit of a shaky start, "Moulin Rouge" regains control and maintains it for the rest of the film. It is an enjoyable surprise that will make you laugh and sing along. Go check out this movie if you can-can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After 2 minutes into this movie we know we will have to totally suspend our belief, ignore the actors and just let the cameraman and editor get on with it. However after 5 minutes just like after eating a big fat cream pie we've had enough and we wish that there will be period whereby the story will take over just like in any good musical.No such luck we're dealing with a director who is very keen in showing us how much references he can squeeze into one movie. The actors don't help very much either. Whispering Nicole Kidman can't avoid looking like a porcelain doll, Ewan McGregor again doesn't seem to care very much (has he ever performed well in a big budget movie?) and the Toulouse Lautrec character might as well be a prop in a porn movie.The love message is hammered into our heads towards the end, as if we shouldn't complain, it's a love story after all, shucks. The last half hour is one long wait for Nicole to die. Let's hope there isn't a Moulin Rouge 2 where her daughter shows up in a fake New York with moody clouds, a token Andy Warhol and a struggling poet who can compose hip-hop songs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't repeat what many have said here about the spectacular visuals, dancing and music. All I will say about that is that this is the best musical I can ever remember seeing! Whatever the critics may say to pick it apart, the sum of the parts is that this movie just plain works. Period. Never mind Nichole Kidman's well-deserved applause, just imagine Obie-Wan belting out a version of "Your Song" that rivals Elton John's, and you'll get an idea of the unique quality of this film.It starts out a bit goofy and quickly turns chaotic, but then settles down to just good old fashioned music and dancing. And through all of the visual and auditory spectacle, you begin to see that there really is a touching, if corny, story underneath it all. The ending is truly tear-jerking.I understand that some people didn't like this movie for the very reasons that make it great: it is bold and different. If your idea of a good musical is along the lines of cute story that is written primarily to show off some new show tunes, you'll probably hate it. But if have an open mind and understand that the main purpose of the cinema is to entertain us, then you'll have to agree: "Spectacular, Spectacular!"Oh, one more thing: Given the subject matter, my kudos go to the director for keeping this film in good enough taste to keep it below an "R" rating. The film itself was not like the in-your-face rather slutty MTV video of "Lady Marmalade" that was used to promote it. Although it had its moments of implied sensuality, I was able to watch this movie with my teenage daughter with no reservations.Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly didn't expect to like "Moulin Rouge". What? Take a bunch of songs made popular by Madonna, Elton John, David Bowie, Sting, and Nat King Cole, and tie them up in a music video-style format? You've got to be kidding?Nope.I grew up during the era when "classic" musicals were still the big thing... "The Sound of Music", "The King and I", "The Music Man"... you know the type. Grand. Beautiful. Safe.Baz Luhrman has managed to re-define what makes a musical. Using every trick in the modern cinematic arsenal, he's created something as grand and beautiful, but never "safe".I didn't like it. I loved it. But then I love theatre. And this is as theatrical as you can get. It's big, brash, larger than life in every aspect, and it MOVES! There's enough energy in this production to power Sydney for a fortnight.I can't begin to talk about the actors... everyone turns in a stellar performance. I already liked Kidman, McGregor, and Leguizamo from previous works, but Jim Broadbent as Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge, and Richard Roxburgh as the delightfully dislikable Duke fit right in and made themselves right at home among my favorite performances. And watching the two of them sing "Like a Virgin" in a Busby Berkeley styled comedy number with a dozen waiters flitting around like a bunch of demented fruit-flies was hysterically funny. When just thinking back on the jokes still makes you laugh, that's good comedy.Basically, the movie was nothing like what I expected... but then, it's not really like anything else, so how could I expect it? But I still liked it... a lot.I doubt "Moulin Rouge" is for everybody, but then again neither is champagne. Me... I like the bubbles.Simply great movie.</fullReview>

The plot elements of love and endurance are absolutely lost under slapstick comedy and artistic camera experiments. Quite frankly, even in the midst of all the turmoil of the plot, I didn't feel a think for these characters. No affection, no pity.This movie came very highly recommended, and it is indeed lovely to look at, but there's no substance here at all.

		<fullReview>I couldn't believe how bad this movie was, after anticipating an enjoyable perspective of a time in French history. Elton John? The Beatles? Late 19th century France? Decadence? Consumption a la "La Boheme"? Dizzying photography in the name of creativity? What were the producers of this disaster thinking? After about an hour and a half that was it. I had to shut it off. What a waste of some very talented actors. Well at least they are working.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They could as well write some music for this musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film develops along a plot that is as cliche, naive and predictable as is cinematographically possible, with most secondary characters bordering on the ridiculous ( Lautrec's ghost should sue the producers ). And that's not all - Ewan McGregor is the British equivalent to Keanu Reeves, totally uninteresting to watch, his expression of emotions and complexities coming out completely forced and shallow ( and singing worst than the average guy on the street ). But anyway, none of it should matter since this is after all a musical, right ? Well, it is here that things really fall apart. The idea of transforming well known tunes to songs for the Moulin Rouge proves funny on occasion, but generally the songs are worst than the original tunes and there is absolutely no worthwhile original music for the viewer to associate with the movie. No tune to whistle back home or remember the next day's morning. The camera work is mostly awful - it moves so fast in the club scenes that one is never left with any images of dancing or with any rythm, just a mixture of sounds, colours and movement that supposedly provides for the "crazy" atmosphere, I guess, but comes out tiresome and boring.So we have a musical that is not funny but mostly annoyingly ridiculous, the music leaves us with no impression and no dance to watch and enjoy ( apart for the Spanish dance scene which is rather indifferent ). Then, of course, there is Nicole - she is gorgeous, sings surprisingly well and acts wonderfully, but all in the wrong movie I'm afraid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is a one joke film. Once that joke has been used several times it becomes tedious.The film has no trace of originality, and the plot is the worst kind of farce. A better example of a doomed love triangle has to be Shakespeare in Love which is much fresher and wittier than this.The singing is weak and goes on endlessly. It's a pity that Jim Broadbent , who was excellent in Topsy Turvy, was so poorly used in this film. Nicole Kidman, supposedly a courtesan, was about as alluring as a cold fish.The disappointment came from having heard such rave reviews about it. I am afraid that I could think of several hundred better films than this. Could anyone seriously say that this is the 'best film they have ever seen' as I have been told? Alfred Hitchcock must be turning in his grave!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It's too bad that the IMDB rating scale only has `1' as the lowest possible rating. `Moulin Rouge' is a textbook case for much of what is wrong with some contemporary popular films. It substitutes technical tricks for style, and frenetic cutting in place of meaningful development. The story is the epitome of triteness, creating a soap opera melange out of Camille, Orpheus, and the old Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney movies where they decide `let's put on a show.' As a deconstructive musical, it depends on send-ups of popular songs to fill out most of its excruciating two-plus hours (there is some undistinguished new material), and this is interspersed with bits and pieces imitating scenes from a wide variety of films of the past, most notably the works of The Three Stooges. The dialogue is extremely lame, often painfully mistaking popular song lyrics for great poetry, and it certainly lives down to the level of the story. The overall attitude of this film, is that if you take the kitchen sink approach and throw in as much stuff at as fast a pace as possible, many people will be tricked into thinking that there's substance here, rather than just the frantic hyperactivity of a desperate mind with a vague notion and a lot of money to spend on bringing it to the screen. This becomes quickly apparent after the same gimmicks are used over and over even in the very beginning of the film. By the end of the film you've seen the same devices so many times that a nauseating numbing effect results. While, like a cinematic junkyard, it is truly crammed with great numbers of things (cuts, costumes, camera moves, set pieces, computer effects, etc.), there is no overriding sense of purpose or vision, just the effects of juxtapositions of elements, and this quickly creates a tedious and irritating result. Nevertheless, many will be fooled into mistaking quantity for quality, and will believe that they saw something of merit. It might also be appreciated by younger people who have been weaned on music videos. `Moulin Rogue' may be the first commercial film created expressly for the ADD crowd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shakespeare by way of SHOWGIRLS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MOULIN ROUGE seems like one of those movies that you either love or hate, mostly because of Baz Luhrmann's style. I actually don't mind his style that much, having enjoyed Australia and, to a lesser degree, THE GREAT GATSBY. Still, I wasn't even ten minutes into this and my head was already spinning. Thankfully, he doesn't keep the visual intensity cranked up to eleven the entire time, but a lot of time was spent in a hyperactive mode that gave me somewhat of a headache, while also laughing at the near-constant absurdity of what I was watching. If I had to describe it, and there are a number of ways to do so, it was like a fever dream or a roller-coaster that is perpetually on a downward course: exhilarating but also exhausting. The plot seemed almost an afterthought, with every romantic cliché of the last 600 years or so being stuffed into a story of tragically doomed romance that was probably old hat when Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet. The acting, from an admittedly impressive roster of talented actors, was so over-the-top that it put primetime soap operas to shame. Just to give one example, John Leguizamo (as Toulouse-Lautrec?) sounded like Elmer Fudd with a lisp. Hopefully they had fun making this because I'd be ashamed to have this on my resume. Anyhow, acting and story aside, MOULIN ROUGE is a rather inventive (if derivative) movie. I would have never thought to set a musical in turn-of-the-century France yet use modern pop songs. The way in which they weave dozens of them in the dialogue is almost comical at times, but it worked for the most part. Where the film really shone, though, was the production design, sets and costumes. Other than paying the actors, this is probably where the most money was lavished, and it showed. Although confined to a few constructed sets, they were gorgeously realized and popping with detail. I don't know how this movie fared at the 2002 Oscars, but it probably got some well-deserved technical awards. Overall, MOULIN ROUGE was rather overwhelming, as if in a constant absinthe-induced delirium partially achieved through rapid-fire editing which gave it the feel of a two-hour music video. Still, Baz Luhrmann's commitment to overdoing every production element has some limited rewards and those are really what makes this worth watching, if only once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Music! Dance! Costumes! Melodrama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young Scottish author (Ewan McGregor) moves to Paris right before the turn of the century to join the Bohemian movement. He's there to write about love, the only problem being that he's never been in love. Luckily, a group of actors recruit him as their new writer and he gets to meet Satine (Nicole Kidman), the Sparkling Diamond of the infamous Moulin Rouge cabaret. Unfortunately, the budding attraction between these two is bad for business as a very wealthy Duke (Richard Roxburgh) is also interested in Satine's, ahem, satins.What Moulin Rouge! does better than pretty much any other film I've ever seen is spectacle. Everything this movie does is gargantuan. Everyone is acting, emoting, always moving, but always in-character. These people are writers, can-can dancers, courtesans, low-life actors. It makes sense that their whole life is one humongous act where it makes perfect, logic sense for someone to burst into a song right out of nowhere. I especially love the scene where the Duke is about to discover the plot, but everyone, without even knowing one another, is able to pull the wool over his eyes with a quickly spun yarn conveyed through glances and fast-talking. That's how in tune with one another these people are.McGregor and Kidman are also very good in their roles and have some genuine chemistry. Sure it's drowned in cheese, it takes them about five minutes to fall in love and the romance is mainly there to be the romance. I don't really think they really get to know one another. But sometimes that can be forgiven if the movie can pull of the mood and the style correctly. And Moulin Rouge! definitely does.The production values are also amazing. The costumes, the music, the whole grandeur. It's also shot with a very distinctive style from the actual curtain opening start to the faded browns of Christian's sorrow to the lusciously vibrant colours of the cabaret. A film many people see solely for the visuals. They're that good.And yeah, it has its flaws. Its many, many, many flaws. The editing is way too fast, making you unable to focus on anything, especially in the beginning until you get used to it. Though, to the film's credit, it slows down a bit after a while. The story is kind of clichéd and the ending twist is rather uncomfortable from the characters' point of view if you think about it too much. Roxburgh's Duke is also completely over the top, so much so that he would stand out in a children's morning cartoon. It's very much intentional and kind of fits in the whole mood of the film, but he's still something of an oddity among the character cast.But, Moulin Rouge! is one of those guilty pleasure movies where you really don't want to change any of the flaws (with the exception of editing speed in my case) because to change them would be to take something away from the experience. It's definitely not for anyone, but personally I appreciate it for what it is and will definitely pop it in everyone now and then for the rest of my life. Just because it is such a unique piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just not for me...too much style over substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to say that first of all, if you like this film, that is fine. I am not saying your opinion is wrong or anything. Just this movie wasn't meant for me. Secondly, I heard of this movie in a review and was turned off by the movie for a while. Then, I watched it with a willingness to accept that I might like this film. Sadly, the movie just made me dislike it. First, I will talk about what I like. The costumes and sets are incredible to see. The color explodes and the designs are very unique. I think the guy who plays Christian (sorry, I forgot his name!) did a great job acting. The singing was also decent. Now for the things I don't like, which, sadly, is a lot. The script felt shallow for me. For example, why is Christian obsessed with love? Sure, his father scoffs at the idea of it, but what else? He is obsessed with the idea before he even falls in love. I wish I could know more about him. Also, the movie describes love as something good...I think. It didn't really give me a new point of view of what love is. The love story in this movie is formulaic and doesn't allow love to be analyzed. Also, I'm just not a fan of love at first sight. But that is just a preference.Another preference that I dislike in this movie is the music. I actually like the original songs this musical plays, but I'm not a fan of jukebox musicals. I hate it more when the music does not fit with the time period. It sucks me out of the time period and brings me to the present and away from the movie. Music is a big part of the experience for me. If the music does not fit the movie well or time period (if it is set in a time period), then I get distracted and start noticing the mistakes in the movie.Finally, I will conclude on my thoughts on the editing and the rest of the acting. The editing is too fast and the wide angle lens is annoying. I know its supposed to be stylistic, but it distracts from the amazing costumes and sets. It jumps around too much. Now, for the acting. It is too over-the-top for my taste. Again, you could say that it is for the style of the movie, but it gets annoying after a while. Sure, there are some slow parts and some subtle acting, but those moments are taken for granted and we don't learn much about the characters besides basic characteristics. There is only depth in the costumes and designs instead of in the characters and story.Take this review for what you will. Like I said, you can like this movie or hate, but this movie is just not for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very Frustrating at times with its signature Luhrman breakneck pace and inability to allow an audience to get into a sequence before cutting away; so many damn cuts. But it's fun to have a lot of music I like in it such as Elton John, Nirvana, Madonna, and Kiss. But there's so much with this movie that is too much. Too much going on makes it hard to like what's happening because you don't know what the hell is going on sometimes and for some reason every one shouts. But hey that's Luhrman's style I guess. It kinda turns me off though. I didn't like Gatsby, I didn't like Romeo and Juliet, and I barely liked this film. I've seen it once so I'm not sure if I'll need or want to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular (but also very sad) show !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I'm not a big fan of musicals, I must definitely say that Moulin Rouge! is a very unconventional movie, when it comes to this specific genre, and with that it immediately caught my attention. Even though it tells a truly saddening story, it's mostly presented in a very joyful manner, with spectacular performances and great dance-and-sing acts.Christopher, a young English writer, arrives in Paris in order to follow the Bohemian Revolution that started in the city's underground world. However, after he is introduced to the prostitute and drug infested community things start to spiral out of control. He meets a beautiful courtesan Satine and deep affection soon follows. The romance takes a hold of this young couple, but nothing can be complete without a few problems on the road. Mainly, the Duke, the sponsor of the whole play, has a thing for Satine too. And in order for the great performance to come to fruition she has to stop running around with Christopher and give in to Duke's filthy desires?It's amazing that through this simple story Baz Luhrmann is able to depict the harsh truth about our lives. Even if we love someone dearly and with all our hearts, there can always be someone to stand in our way. Someone richer and more powerful and who is actually able to buy his dreams instead of working to achieve them. And even being able to withhold this obstacle may be not enough, as the movie sadly shows.Funny thing is that the first 15 or 20 minutes make an impression that the movie is going to be weirdly psychedelic. The use of light, colors, fast camera movements and, most of all, eerie characters, provide for an unforgettable experience. Still, a few moments later there is a sudden change of pace and the movie takes on a new turn to make it more dramatic. And this is a recurring motive in this picture.The music in Moulin Rouge is very enjoyable and fun to listen, due to many very clever mash- ups of famous songs by world-renown artists, including Madonna, Queen, Elton John, Marilyn Monroe and even Nirvana. The versions written for Moulin Rouge! give those songs a brand new twist, and are actually very entertaining.The movie also makes a great use of various camera techniques, especially of regular close close-ups and numerous swirls and spins, to give the picture an avant-garde feeling.Great acting by young Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman is the true quality, which shapes the overall appearance of this film. There are some fantastic (and erotic) sequences that may deliver many laughs. However, the scene, which represents the brilliance of these two actors, is contained in the big finale - the great and fabulous theatrical show, which ends in a huge tragedy. There aren't many pictures, where you'll find such a passionate scene of unbearable and tragic loss, accompanied by such loud cries of helplessness. A true tearjerker.Overall, I would like to say that it is definitely a movie worth watching, and as a proof of it look at the trend that may be observed throughout the first decade of the 21st century: after Moulin Rouge!'s success many musical features started appearing all around the world. And they still are. That's the power of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie looks amazing. The cinematography and set design is absolutely spectacular. The songs are all fitting and I loved each of them. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman were both fantastic. The pacing and writing, however, is not as good as it could've been.It begins by outright telling us how it will end. It could've been effective but instead just takes away any suspense the film might have had down the line. Then it moves at light speed to get us in the midst of the story rather than taking its time and engrossing us in this fantastical world.Although it didn't set itself up particularly well, the second act is easily the strongest of the film. Ewan and Nicole have wonderful chemistry and all the scenes between them are better written than any other. But when it isn't between them, the film seems to take ridiculous routes to the plot just to get from point A to point B in a zany matter. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.Overall, this movie is a good musical with some very memorable scenes and songs but its weaknesses do drag it down quite a bit. Had the screenplay been much tighter and kept all focus on helping further the drama between our leads, then this may have been the best musical since Singin' In The Rain. Instead, it's just a pretty good musical but at least it got a lot of awards and helped bring back the modern musical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Rouge was a great love story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a true love store set in the eighteen hundreds. A writer played by Ewan McGregor named Christian became the writer of a new show, "Spectacular Spectacular" at the Moulin Rouge. The Moulin Rouge was a club that supported prostitution. Christian meets Satine played by Nicole Kidman, the star of Moulin Rouge. He fell deeply in love with her. The show needed funding so The Duke of Monroth played by Richard Roxburgh, invested in the show as long as he could have Satine. Harold played by Jim Broadbent, the owner of the Moulin Rouge agreed. Christian and Satine started rehearsing the new show and soon formed a secret relationship. Christian and Satine were going to run away when the Duke found out about their relationship, but Harold told Satine she was dying of consumption. Satine told Christian she chooses The Duke and can't see him again. Christian leaves than comes back for the opening night of the show. They get back together in the middle of the show, but after the show ended Satine dies.The love theme was well illustrated in many scenes of this film, mostly through music. There were many other techniques used to illustrate the love theme. The lightening and angles of the camera supported the love scenes. For example when Satine and Christian were in each other's arms singing, the camera was focused directly on their faces in order for the audience to see the love they felt for each other through their eyes. The lightening was always bright when they were together and when they were sad the scenes were barely lit. This film reminded me of Burlesque starring Christina Aguilera. They both have the same love theme and had the same genre. They also used the same techniques such as the music and lightening. The love theme is universal and is common in many films. This film connected with many people on a different level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The year is 1899, and Christian, a young English writer, has come to Paris to follow the Bohemian revolution taking hold of the city's drug and prostitute infested underworld. And nowhere is the thrill of the underworld more alive than at the Moulin Rouge, a night club where the rich and poor men alike come to be entertained by the dancers, but things take a wicked turn for Christian as he starts a deadly love affair with the star courtesan of the club, Satine. But her affections are also coveted by the club's patron: the Duke. A dangerous love triangle ensues as Satine and Christian attempt to fight all odds to stay together but a force that not even love can conquer is taking its toll on Satine. The third film from pop-music-obsessed director Baz Luhrmann tweaks the conventions of the musical genre by mixing a period romance with anachronistic dialogue and songs in the style of his previous Romeo+Juliet (1996). Ewan McGregor stars as Christian, who leaves behind his bourgeois father during the French belle ? (C)poque of the late 1890s to seek his fortunes in the bohemian underworld of Montmartre, Paris. Christian meets the absinthe- and alcohol-addicted artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo), who introduces him to a world of sex, drugs, music, theater, and the scandalous dance known as the cancan, all at the Moulin Rouge, a decadent dance hall, brothel, and theater that's the brainchild of Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent). Christian also meets and falls into a tragically doomed romance with the courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman), who becomes the star of the play he's writing, which parallels the couple's romance and utilizes rock music from a century later.Starring Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent, Richard Roxburgh , Garry McDonald , Jacek Koman , Matthew Whittet , Kerry Walker , Caroline O'Connor , David Wenham , Christine Anu , Natalie Jackson Mendoza , Lara Mulcahy , Kylie Minogue.Nominated for 8 Oscars while winning 2 including Best Art Direction and Costumes Design. Other nominations are Best Picture, Lead Actress Nicole Kidman, Sound, Editing, Cinematography and Make up.it took me years to finally see this much hyped movie. while to be honest i am not 100% impressed or loved it the way others did. it is still a good movie but slightly overrated. i have seen much better musical movies. but its a nice addition in the Hollywood musicals. it was the first musical in 22 years to get a Best Picture nomination. while i think Chicago was far more better than this movie.this is a movie torn between comedy and drama which always annoys me, i was turned off by the beginning of this movie where they threw extra and unnecessary silly humor and over exaggerated jokes with so much of silliness that i was about to call this movie lame and question the Academy but what i saw after it, was enough to make me like this movie. but still the humor was bad and not all good.its a romantic jukebox musical film with music from previously sung songs not original. a forbidden romance between a writer and a ill dancer. movie is breathtakingly beautiful to see and eye catching visuals. you watch this movie with wonder eyes. it had glitz and glamour with nowadays pop rock music along with some touchy romantic songs. such an artistic effort it is. great art direction, one of the best. superb costumes and cinematography. amazing every other technical aspects. nice editing. i think the direction and Screenplay had some flaws and were a letdown. complaints about them. those departments could have been better.Directed by Baz Luhrmann who has a thing for musicals and had made few movies like Romeo+Juliet and Australia along with a lesser known Strictly Ballroom. songs were nicely done and sung and well used with good choreography.Nicole Kidman outshines and this movie makes her the most beautiful and gorgeous woman on earth i mean look at her she looks the BEST. beauty at its best. not just that i liked her performance very much. i consider it her 3rd or 4th best performance of her career. its hard for me to like a actor in a musical or comedy. but she did a good job, in many scenes she really outshined. one of the best performance. while Ewan McGregor gave a good performance too. i didn't liked him as much as i did Jim Broadbent who according to me was the best male performer of this movie. john was good too. so good performances overall and good casting too.this modern spectacular musical might have not impressed me the way it should have but still i consider it a good movie to watch. the comedy is a turn off but the music, visuals and romance is just too good.

		<fullReview>I remember Moulin Rouge! (MR) being featured very heavily at the beginning of spring and its subsequent release. The musical (outside of animation) was a dead genre until the arrival of MR. As I sit watching this movie on this day--a day after the music world has suffered a tremendous loss of talent, it reminds me of a few scant years ago when optimism and frivolity were the daily trends. Spiritual refreshment could consist of a trip to coffee bar, and nothing deep was required to put the world into order.MR was the height of this light-hearted time -- a film about competing lovers and a dying young woman--La Boheme simplified. MR followed such light films as "Can't Hardly Wait", "American Pie", and "Scream".Then, came darkness on a crisp, fall morning--change. But, the musical genre was revived. "High School, the Musical", "Phantom of...", "Chicago", "Sweeney Todd", and so forth follow in the shadow of MR.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the songs in this movie were to be more rhythmic, you would have read tons of comments along the lines of 'MTV style editing' - I don't have a problem with fast editing, but in this one there are sequences composed of countless shots under a second in length, and they are long enough to make me dizzy.Senses are purposely overloaded and silly plot devices are layered one above the other to form giant heaps which should be conveying a feeling of joyful mindlessness, yet if you take a step back and look at the big picture the plot has a nice symmetry intertwined all throughout.The cast as a whole works, but Kidman came through as totally unbearable, she was like so totally over the top that if I was to compare her to a food, I'd say the cook has totally ruined the raw material by mistakenly pouring a ton of salt and spices. The underlying flavor of the character is totally blown away by the excesses of her interpretation (and FWIW the mindbending squealing) Despite involvement of famed producers like Craig Armstrong and Marius DeVries some songs are totally unlistenable (it doesn't help that the choice of Broadbent apparently couldn't sing even if it was a matter of life or death). I'm thinking of Show must go on, though on average the music wasn't so bad (the medley are a bit forced IMO), and couldn't avoid smiling when I recognized Gorecki.All in all there are good things in this movie but its flaws completely overshadow anything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say the extravagance of the movie at the beginning was quite hard to follow, and seemed slightly too eccentric, but then again that's Moulin Rogue in a nutshell. However I did think the usage of Madonnas "like a virgin" and songs like "love lift us up where we belong" made it slightly "cheesy". The beauty of the script was undeniable, the huge theme of love throughout the play almost had me in tears at it's beauty. I loved seeing the character of Satine (Nicole Kidman) evolve from and excellent manipulator of men into someone who truly awakens to love. Fantastic performances from all the cast. It really felt like someone had sat you in the most extravagant show that the world could possibly offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over substance, perhaps; and yet entirely befitting of the tone of the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite a certain over-the-top pomposity and a general belief that it's doing something completely revolutionary with a tried and tested genre, Moulin Rouge (2001) is, at its heart, a 'good' film! The problem I imagine most people have when approaching it would be the first twenty-minutes; an almost incomprehensible mish-mash of silent film references and 21st century digital film techniques crossed thematically with contrasting elements of tragedy and humour. These first twenty minutes prove to be the jumping off point for many viewers; with the film giving us time to settle into its particular approach and use of cinematic language before getting into the more rewarding elements of the story at hand. For those who jumped ship, so to speak, the true power of the film will be wasted, with the initial shock value of the film's opening sequences eventually giving way to the more broadly recognisable aspects of the story; a story about Truth, Beauty, Freedom and, above all things else, Love.Accusations of style over substance are probably accurate, with the formulaic plot being a well-worn one, mixing themes from classic opera such as La Boh?me and Madam Butterfly - and even Luhrmann's own radical adaptation of Romeo + Juliet (1996) - with the idea of love struck poet Christian (McGregor) and celebrated burlesque performer Satine's (Kidman) secret affair becoming all too public, as the impending (and one must say, fairly obvious) sense of tragedy looms over their heads. However, as a musical, the use of style is entirely befitting of the form, especially when we take into consideration the use of absinth as one of the major motivators for the plot, not to mention the overly romanticised nature of the theme. So, we have both light and dark elements at play within the story; the light from the high-kicking musical numbers and the dark coming from the more operatic themed sense of tragedy, and all somewhat akin to the work of Dennis Potter perhaps, in which the recognisable melodrama of the musical was elevated to an agonisingly painful and personal degree.The style nonetheless is there for a reason, creating a heightened world in which Lurhmann's anachronistic story unfolds. From the colourful and lively cinematography, to the editing, which is really at its best - with a remarkable use of juxtaposition of scenes presented within the "Tango de Roxanne" sequence, with the lyrical metaphors of The Police song about a prostitute who dared to fall in love - the film is a non-stop, giddy, kaleidoscope of visual motifs, references and elements of theatrical pastiche. It fully illustrates Lurhmann's skill as perhaps more of a stylist than storyteller, but you could certainly say the same thing about highly acclaimed filmmakers like Seijun Suzuki, Derek Jarman, Jacques Demy or Wong Kar-Wai. Without question, Moulin Rouge will always be something of a "love it or hate it" film for most audience - turning away some viewers whilst delighting others - with the enjoyment you get from the film really depending on how much work you're willing to put in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult to judge, I feel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers! (Possibly)Exactly what kind of film am I watching?, I wondered after the first few minutes. Was it all some strange crossover between a movie and a videoclip? Was it all about style and 2-dimensional characters, like "Pulp Fiction" and "Reservoir Dogs" were? The beginning was so absurdly ridiculous that I briefly thought it was an imitation of the style of "Amelie", which used similar rapid changes and general fast pacing. Of course I was familiar with Baz Luhrmann's rendition of "Romeo and Juliet", which I loved, but couldn't be sure that it would turn out to be a similar story with music and more flash. Then, when the "convincing the Duke" scene flashed by, it began to look more like an old-fashioned slapstick cleverly adapted for modern viewers.But then it began to look more and more as if the whole thing was serious, and the "hopeless love" angle dominated the rest of the movie.All in all a rather odd mixture of styles. Why not start out on the same serious tone that the movie was to have for the most part?What did *not* bother me was the high speed of most scenes, the dancing and the use of modern music. I liked them a lot, and was amazed by the spirit and feeling that Ewan McGregor puts in his singing. That lifeless old Elton John song "This is your song" sounded so sincere, heart warming and desperate at the same time when Obi Wan (oops!) was singing it. Brilliant! Ewan should really consider a singing career next to his acting exploits.Still, in the end I find it hard to completely discard the "cartoony" feel which all of the characters had in the beginning. That leaves me with the lingering doubt that the whole thing was somewhat tongue-in-cheek anyway, which jars with the deeply tragic ending.Another "jarring" element was the "Lady Marmalade" video featuring Pink, Mya, Christina &amp; Li'l Kim. Although not a part of the movie (the tune sometimes played through it, though), it cannot help but create some sort of pre-impression. And that video, basically sung by artists pretending to be prostitutes, doesn't really have all that much to do with the movie. Sure, Satine is a "courtisane", but the whole attitude displayed in the movie centers around "Truth, Beauty, Freedom, Love". That video, sexy though it may be, was simply bad marketing for the film.So, did I enjoy the movie?Weeeell, yes. Kind of. Mostly the musical scores (liking those is simply a matter of taste, and I happen to like them) and the serious drama bit in the second half of the movie. I wouldn't want to see another movie in the style of MR, though. But MR itself I'll probably buy as a second hand DVD somewhere...Overall: 7.5/10</fullReview>

It shows elements of Cabaret and Rocky Horror and its very own taste of bizarre. The plot is simple enough underneath it all as most musicals are, ala any later Elvis movie, but it proved to me to be a tough pill to swallow. It is like watching "The Wall" by Pink Floyd but wanting something lighter. It is a larger than life experience that you will love or hate, and that says something about it. For me personally it was to convoluted and lost in its excess, but I could see that this could be someone's favorite movie that they would defend with very good reason. It definitely is cinematic art, you just got to ask yourself what mood you are in before you watch it.</fullReview>

Jim Broadbent and John Leguziamo are really great in this movie as well. Mr Leguziamo once again shows he can play in any type of film in any movie genre and new to the US movie screens but not to her native country of Australia is Caroline O'Connor who plays the charachter of Nini with her legs in the Air as her supporting role is a prominent one.

		<shortDescription>An energetic and visually stunning assault on the senses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being a big fan of musicals, I was hesitant about watching this film. However, it's now on my list of personal favorites.When Satine (Nicole Kidman), a jaded courtesan, sets out to seduce a rich duke (Richard Roxburgh) into financially backing the theater, she unwittingly seduces Christian (Ewan McGregor), a young, penniless writer, instead. The couple must keep their forbidden love a secret as Satine works her wiles on the duke, while at the same time everyone else is keeping Satine's failing health a secret from her, which makes for a stunning hybrid of romantic comedy and Greek tragedy. Kidman and McGregor give good performances and the chemistry between the two lovers is completely convincing.Brilliantly spoofing musicals from the 1930's-1950's, this film makes excellent use of 20th century music in a 19th century setting. The scene where the older French man sings "Like A Virgin" is just one of many must-see-to-believe scenes. Yes, it's over-the-top, but that just adds to the charm of this creative, visually superb and unique film.</fullReview>

Brilliant to take a classic setting like the Moulin Rouge and inject it with contemporary music. I was completely blown away by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor's performances, they were terrific, and they had great chemistry. The Elephant Love Medley gave me goosebumps.*Possible Spoiler*I have never really been impressed by Nicole Kidman in the past, but her scenes were sexy, charming and the dramatic scene where she races back to Christian's arms, not being able to go through with her seduction of the Duke, was gripping and put a lump in my throat that very few other movies have in a long time. Kidman received all the accolades and awards and deservingly so, however it was McGregor who impressed me the most. A good, strong singing voice, excellent in the dramatic scenes and equally good in the comedy scenes, proving yet again the range, diversity and talent of this actor.I now have the movie soundtrack and the video and can enjoy it many times over. Good entertainment - Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all- Love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most fascinating aspect of this thoroughly amazing production is the fact that it pushes the envelope so far, has so much room for failure and at the end emerges as one of the most stylistically original pieces of filmmaking ever! First its a musical, I would have used original music being that the use of the music can turn off certain audience members, however it is how the music is used and arranged that make it work beautifully. With the exception of Elton John's "Your Song" all the popular tunes are cleverly rearranged and re-invented. One can attribute that the multiple references to Madonna come from perhaps Mr. Lurhman's first choice for leading lady, which was replaced by Ms. Kidman once he saw her on broadway in The Blue Room. To wrap it up, the film was one emotional roller coaster of phantasmagoric sight and sound, one bright, beautiful gorgeous piece of sumptuous eye candy. Simply Delightful!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By the original songs - they are better value</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After two brilliant movies (Strictly Ballroom and Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet), Baz Luhrmann falls prey to overconfidence and over-funding in this spectacular but empty re-working of the Moulin Rouge brothel-come-cabaret-club historical icon. The tale (what there is of it - lowly writer gets off with top-notch courtesan by being mistaken for a duke) is told using modern pop song lyrics, frequently taken out of the song and used as dialogue. "It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside" quips Ewan McGregor as he woos Nicole Kidman - not surprising, mate, anyone would feel a bit funny trying to make a whole movie out of lines from pop songs. According to the Director, this is the "contract with the audience", as was the dancing in Strictly Ballroom or the Shakespearean language in Romeo and Juliet. Unfortunately, unlike those two movies, we don't have the genuine article for one minute in Moulin Rouge. Although both McGregor and Kidman can sing passably (as well as act to a much higher level than this tosh deserves), they are not Elton John. So the "Contract with the Audience" is fake from the start. Many will think this is quibbling. After all, you have Kidman looking stunning, Kylie Minogue thrown in for good measure, incredibly amazing sets (literally - suspense of disbelief vaporises in the first few minutes), some nice song and dance routines and, all in all, a couple of hours of nice, mindless, fluffy entertainment. Occasionally there lines of dialogue not blatantly taken from a song. These are instantly recognizable by the fact that they are badly written and would probably never have made the charts eg "She is mine!" or "Things aren't always as they seem." The better lines are nicked from Madonna, Bowie, Elton John etc etc. and the only (apparently original) line that has the semblance of being produced by anyone with experience of writing is the one used for the publicity: "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return." Not bad. It seems Luhrmann and his co-writer, having relied on brilliant dancers and a brilliant play in their former efforts and feel that a scriptwriter is dispensable. Moulin Rouge, whilst demonstrating some wonderful cinematic techniques and looking like the actors had great fun making it, proves that it this isn't so. If you go and see Moulin Rouge, keep your expectations low, have several pints of beer first, and rave about how wonderful it's going to be beforehand - it won't be - but you might get through it by convincing yourself you've had a nice time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say that hasn't already been said? Moulin Rouge is truly all of what it seems. You really get hit by all the noise and colours in the first 15 minutes. Dancing, yelling, singing and chaos ensues, but after that initial burst, the film settles into the story. Christian (Ewan McGregor, looking every inch the soulful, sincere lover) is a penniless poet/writer who's moved to Montmartre to join in the Bohemian revolution. He falls in with a group of hardcore bohemians (led by John Leguizamo's lisping dwarf, Toulouse Lautrec) and somehow manages to fall in love with the Moulin Rouge's great courtesan, the beautiful Satine (Nicole Kidman, perfection personified in this), while writing a play for the famed dance hall. Intervention comes in the form of the Duke (a menacing Richard Roxburgh), who believes Satine is his property. Watch out for Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler, owner of the Moulin Rouge, and a cameo by Aussie pop queen Kylie Minogue as the 'Green Fairy' of 'Green Fairy Absinthe'.The performances are strikingly beautiful, and everything each character says has meaning. The supporting characters are vital to the story, and in more than one scene they have a key role to play. That said, I think Moulin Rouge will begin a renaissance in musicals, and influence the way they're done for years to come. 9 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think I watched Carry on Moulin Rouge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mmmm. Moulin Rouge. Reading the rave reviews for this film starring Ewan McGregor and the lovely Nicole Kidman doesn't really prepare you for whats ahead. "Fantastic, brilliant, a must see" are the sort of things said about this film. So whats it all about then. Well, basically its a love story, boy meets girl, boy loses girl etc etc. It starts off loudly with lots of dazzling lights, and for the first 15 minutes its a bit hard to know what the hell is going on. But then you hear a song you know and you get into the swing of it. Before you know it youve got Elton John or George Benson in wonderful Dolby Stereo (so im informed). But heres the first disappointing bit: I like Elton and Georges songs, but feel that they perform them best, and with the best will in the world Ewan McGregor is not in their league. Not a bad actor, but a singer? Oooh, I think not.When I first saw the reviews for this film there was one word that stuck in my mind: Erotic. Im now thinking Nicole Kidman plus erotic equals worth ?6 of anybodies money. And I feel a bit cheated. Where was the naughty bits that I had been promised? 2 hours of Nicole and not a jot. Oh well, perhaps next time.So what did I think of the film overall. Well, to be honest, Im not sure. It reminded me of a cross between a Benny Hill sketch, a Carry on film and an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical (not bad then I hear you say). Admittedly it didnt help that the cinema was so packed I had to sit nearer to the front than is decent. This from a man who has to hold the newspaper at arms length to read it. I also found that I watched most of the film with my mouth open, either in awe or disbelief, I'm not sure. When the credits rolled at the end I looked at my fellow film goers and they, too, had their mouths open. And for a few moments we all sat there in silence.I cant say I didnt like the film (I've been humming the tunes for days. But that I think is the problem. It wasn't original, and I feel that I could have sat at home with the CD player on and enjoyed myself just as much, with the REAL Elton and George for company.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is simply fantastic! Its not the best film ever, but in these dark days it is the perfect tonic of escape to a different more romantic world which sadly does not exist today. The acting, songs, sets and costumes are out of this world.I don't go to the cinema to watch further news of misery and suffering, its thrusted down our necks all the time.At the end of a terrible week, this is a retreat into a magical beautiful world, one that is so so rare today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My first thought on seeing Moulin Rouge was that it marks such a definitive break from the deluge of mediocrity that has generally characterised the films of 2001 thus far, that the makers of such dirge as Tomb Raider should bow down and genuflect before Baz Luhrmann, their new God. The man is clearly a genius. Visually, Moulin Rouge is like nothing anyone has ever seen before. The mixture of contemporary and older songs in the turn of the century setting in the first half hour is breathtaking. After this, Romeo and Juliet and Strictly Ballroom, Baz is surely one of the greats of our time (as well as the campest film-maker since John Waters).However, Moulin Rouge is not without flaw. The finale is essentially at the start. It opens brilliantly (after a bit of scene setting) and thereafter gets slowly worse. It's never remotely bad and there's great stuff throughout most of its running time, but my attention was slightly wavering by the end and it's perhaps a tad too long.Yet it's still great and one of the few essential viewings of 2001. Ewan and Nicole can both sing and surprisingly the Scotsman is perhaps the better vocalist of the two. I particularly enjoyed the amusing rendition of 'Like a Virgin'. It's certainly the gayest film since 'Top Gun' was released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definite 'Love-It-Or-Loathe-It' Territory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are those moments in the film so excruciatingly embarrassing that you quite literally squirm in your seat in discomfort. Similarly, there are sequences that make the hairs stand up on your arms, your skin turn to gooseflesh, and transport you so far from the cinema that you can forget about all the gibbering, squawking 13 year olds behind you. Jam-packed with a dozen kinds of digital jiggery-pokery and some of the most incredible and overblown set design this side of Bollywood, the movie is like a 2hr MTV clip designed by Pierre et Gilles (and that's no bad thing). Okay, so there's very little story, nothing in the way of character arcs or subplot and midpoint climaxes, but there IS lots of colour, dancing and jaw dropping spectacle. Kidman and McGregor give excellent performances given the context, she a modern day Gilda (but where's the piano?), he all grinning naivety (with an excellent voice). The music is brilliantly mixed, at times several songs blending together into an indefinable, yet oddly familiar whole. Highlights, for me -- the duel/exchange of love song lyrics mutating into Bowie's 'Heroes' atop a gilded elephant, and the excellent tango/Roxanne sequence. Definitely a love it or loathe it film. Indifference unlikely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Bohemia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann is credited with making a star of Leonardo di Caprio, his leading man in 1996's "William Shakespeare's 'Romeo + Juliet'", but with his latest project he's gone one step better and hired two actors who are already stars in their own right. Ewan Mc Gregor and Nicole Kidman take centrestage in Luhrmann's colourful musical "Moulin Rouge" and both seize the opportunity with such vigor and that its difficult to watch it without succumbing to the whirling vortex of energetic song and dance set in 19th century Paris.Mc Gregor plays the part of struggling writer Christian, new to the Parisian scene, and willing to fully immerse himself in the Bohemian culture of truth, beauty, freedom and love. Kidman plays the courtesan Satine, the most revered of Moulin Rouge's performers, who one day dreams of becoming a "real actress"; simply put, she is the proverbial "tart with a heart". The Bohemian themes are explored through a continuous explosion of song and dance, but Luhrmann makes no attempt to camouflage the music with authentic Bohemian sounds, instead opting to utilise a vast array of 20th century hits, ranging from 'Diamonds are a girls best friend' to Nirvanas grunge anthem 'Smells like teen spirit'. While the music used may not be original Luhrmann, the means in which he paints the scenes with his borrowed musical interludes give them a reinvented sheen, and are further complimented by Mc Gregor and Kidmans surprisingly talented vocals. Even if this wasn't the case, it would do little to take away from Kidmans hypnotic performance, which is sure to be seriously considered when the Oscar nominations are announced early next year.The supporting cast are equally impressive, with Kylie Minogues cameo as the Green Fairy providing us with one of the films highlights, while Jim Broadbent as the Moulin Rouges manager and Richard Roxburgh as the seedy Duke of Worcester are well suited to their roles and help contribute to an impressive enamel on an already glossy production.On the minus side, the second half is weighed down by a sluggish, emotional punch, and while it's obvious that this is a tragedy from the beginning, it seems to do little to detach itself from tragic clichés. Play this off against the quick paced first half, and you've got an unbalanced result. The cartoon-like sound effects also begin to grate after a while, but ultimately, "Moulin Rouge" is a pleasing experience, which owes most of its pleasure to the central performances and the sometimes hilarious, often touching use of modern music. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is an amazing film, you cannot deny it that. I cannot praise it highly enough. The musical numbers are a work of genius, and show excellence in every single aspect of film-making, and some aspects you didn't even know existed. It shows touches of brilliance in places where other films don't even have places. The acting is superb and because the acting is superb the casting is superb. The singing is wonderful too. The duets between Nicole and Ewan are delightful, and the no-holds-barred in-your-face song and dance routines are breathtaking. Musically, there is genius stamped all over this film - where else are you going to find Lady Marmalade blended perfectly with Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit; Madonna's Like A Virgin re-worked into a mini-operetta; or a love serenade that glides seamlessly from The Beatles to Whitney Houston without seeming out of place? And at the heart of it all, a tragic love story so simple and pure that it could have flowed from the pen of Shakespeare or been scrawled by the stylus of Homer.And yet, this high-concept simplicity of the story proves to be the downfall of the film. With no other concepts on the menu other than Ewan's undying love for Nicole, and her predicament, the film is doomed from the onset - it has nowhere to go but towards its final destination, and nothing to do but repeat itself until it gets there. There are several key lines and song lyrics in the film which will stick in your head at the end; but were you astute enough to notice that the only reason they stuck is because you heard them six times each? It's as though the writers had a photocopying problem and ended up with a rogue page of dialogue repeatedly popping up elsewhere in the script. Either that or Baz Luhrmann is unaccustomed to the phrase "flogging a dead horse". That major plot simplicity gripe aside, the only other thing that irked me was the cinematography - a lot of the time images looked as though they had very little depth of field and poor reproduction of dark colours, almost as if they had been shot on a poor-quality DV camera. Maybe this was intentional and maybe not, but either way it did the film no favours. Having said which, all the colours and digitally-enhanced bits were vibrant, and you can forget any stunning landscape or sunset shots you may have seen in your life, because the close-ups of Nicole's face have redefined the meaning of beautiful cinematography - at least in my humble opinion :)Anyway, as you can probably tell by my words, Moulin Rouge is a two-faced demon of a film - at its best, inspired, uplifting, and beautiful; and at its worst, repetitive, clichéd, and overly simplistic.I'm sure it will be remembered forever for its daring originality in bringing a forgotten genre back to life, but whether it deserves a place in our memories as one of the all-time great films... is highly debatable to say the least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you remember musicals? Forget about it! No more "Wizard Of Oz" or "West Side Story". Rock music is here to stay. If you love pop music you will enjoy this movie more than any video-clip. Moulin Rouge proves that pop culture is now part of the artistic influences. Police, Beatles, Kiss, Queen, even Madonna all appear in this extraordinary movie. The voices take it all! Even if you don't like rock, these operatic performances are so great that you will love the music at the same time you hate Nirvana. If music isn't enough, the cinematography is too beautiful to forget. The acting, the direction, everything is different to whatever you have seen before. Don't miss it.If you have spent 20 years listening to rock you will enjoy much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read some po-faced reviews of Moulin Rouge in the UK, and I just can't believe it! It seems that most reviewers are either so sad, cynical and jealous as to refuse anyone else a great time, or they have simply lost the ability to melt into a movie house seat and lose themselves in a movie that entertains with a capital E. What an amazing concept, what a great cast, what eye candy! Weeks after seeing it, I still have occasional flashes of the set, the dancing, the hilarious music mixing, etc. I'm not ashamed to say I'm Australian, but neither do I feel I am one-sided in my support for the film. It is great in anyone's language, whoever made it and wherever/whenever it was made. (Although it is unmistakably Baz Lurhmann, after the excellent Strictly Ballroom and Romeo + Juilet).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm shocked at the rapturous reception this film has received here, but I suppose its one of those love-it-or-hate-it movies. I hated it, and found it very patronising - the number of obvious cultural reference points which are supposed to be oh-so-clever was particularly grating. Even the much-touted energy of the film was actually little more than swift and disjunctive montage, as opposed to smooth and continuous editing. What splendour there may have been in the sets and costumes was lost in the rush to usher in the next image. And was there a point to the whole enterprise? To revive the musical. Why? Because people don't make musicals anymore. So says Luhrmann. Of course people don't make musicals anymore, simply because its an outdated genre that doesn't suit our times, but at least the best musicals from the 30s to the 50s had a point, something to say within their musical framework. They reworked old tunes in the same way that this film eschews original lyrics in favour of "pop" classics. And they deployed all available technologies to stage enormous dance spectaculars to show off the talent of the human performers. Moulin Rouge uses techniques to hide the fact that its leads can't dance and are miming single lines at a time - there are no long takes for them to give a real performance. This is a movie about how they don't make movies like they used to. It proves its own point by its own failure. And Ewan McGregor is the most overrated actor of his generation. And he can't sing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MOULIN ROUGE: MOVIE GRADE: **1/2 out of **** BAD MOVIE GRADE: ***1/2 out of ****Moulin Rouge is one of the funniest movies of the year. Ignore everyone who says it's "stunning, beautiful, well acted". This is nothing more than a hilarious expensive B-Movie. The acting (Especially by Leguizamo) is so over the top that you just can't help but laugh. The lines are so dumb that it's hilarious whenever somebody says them. Just about anything Jim Broadbent said had me in stitches for days. Just about the only thing that is intentionally good is the singing. Ewan and Nicole can really sing well. Though I worry about Baz Luhrmann. He shows a midget in a bikini 3 times, an extreme close-up of John Leguizamo in clown make-up, and fat guys doing cart-wheels. I hope he's just joshing us and that MR is one big hilarious joke. So don't go in expecting something thought-provoking. Go in expecting the funniest musical parody since South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I highly regard the 1952 'Moulin Rouge' directed by John Houston which was a fictionalised 'biography' of Toulouse Lautrec. The first few minutes of the older film were sensational with stunning production design and cinematography. Though the rest of the film was melodrama, albeit superior with terrific acting and a memorable score, it did not really keep the viewer on the edge of his or her seat.I was quite mesmerised with the opening scenes of the new 'Moulin Rouge!' and could not imagine how it could possibly keep up the pace till the end. But it managed this triumphantly with the result that I regard this film as being the most-satisfying cinematic experience I have had in a long time.Some view this film as a musical but I think it is far more than that: it is pure cinema, creating experiences impossible to obtain through any other medium. The film reminds me of Powell &amp; Pressburger's 'The Red Shoes'. The plots (for what they are worth) are almost identical: boy meets girl; girl is torn between boy and other interests; girl dies. Whilst the 'The Red Shoes' was pure cinema in the ballet sequence with a conventional beginning and ending (not that P &amp; P were ever that 'conventional') 'Moulin Rouge!' is pure cinema from beginning to end. Terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever devices used well, and almost a new cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luhrmann realises one important thing. That if you want to evoke apowerful response from an audience you can achieve that not bypursuing the representation of reality, but by abandoning realityentirely.It's a clever device, and used well in Moulin Rouge. As theaudience is led through the opening curtain, it is invited toabandon the rules and regulations of the real world. Once theaudience is in Luhrmann's world, he can do anything he wants.As a story, it's good, though not remarkable. But as a film, it is acelebration of what's best about cinema. The use of colour, scale,motion, and clever editing, the use of contrast, light and dark,make for a film that seduces you and sucks you in, and keeps youwatching.Another clever device is the use of music. Luhrmann knows that ifa character speaks a few words of a famous love song, the sceneand the film will inherit the emotional response engendered bythat song. This magpie approach is true of many of the props andcostumes in the film. He taps into our psyches and into our myths,and uses them to great effect. It is very much an internal film. It is set in a closed, dark, shadyworld, but one in which the diamonds of people and personalitiesshine bright. It's a lovely backdrop for a simple love story, and astruggle between carigatures of good and evil. It's got a delicate,innocent comedy that gives the film a pleasant balance.You can't really fault the casting or the acting, and you come outwith a greater respect for the actors involved. In all, a good film,and a film with big director visibility, and arguably a genre in itsown right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not since Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon have I been so enthusiastic about a film.Having just come from the cinema, I couldn't wait until to write this in case my mind forgets the small details. Moulin Rouge is quite simply fantastic.The directing, acting, cinematography, singing and of course the music are first rate.I was glued to my seat (a hurricane wouldn't of moved me) for the 2 hour duration. I didn't look at my watch once (which is unusual for me) my eyes where transfixed to the silver screen.The first 10 minutes you are thinking "this is very strange and what on earth am I watching". But when you get used to this (it doesn't take long) you are in amazement. Their is a 15 minute (approximately) scene near the beginning which leaves your jaw open right to the floor.Luhrmann has decided to give us can-can dancers, dancing and singing to the likes of Nirvana's "Smells like teen spirit" to name but a few. With close up camera shots, fast moving pace and flashy editing. Sure there is a few corny scenes during the films between McGregor and Kidman. But it is a true wonder to watch.You have got to watch out for the excellent re-working of Madonnas "Like a Virgin". The film was also just the right length another 20 minutes and it might of started dragging. 20 minutes shorter and I would of been annoyed.I have forgot to mention McGregor and Kidman's singing, ignore what all/some of the critic's are saying they really can and do sing. The whole perzaz, Luhrmann's flare for style and being unconventional are something else.I urge everybody to see this film. It is definitely in my top 5 of films seen at the cinema this year.Thank you for reading this far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Shakespeare's day communication was mainly aural. Thus your average Elizabethan could absorb more words in a minute than this modern decedent. We live in a visual era and this film challenges our capacity to process images to the full. Visually it is stunning. Sit back and let the experience wash over you. The story is not complicated and the dialogue relies much on the potency of cheap music (many popular songwriters coffers will be lined by this film), but it doesn't matter.

My sister and I, after seeing this marvellous creation, sat motionless in our seats. Actually, nobody in the whole screening moved. We were so amazed at the drama and the talent we had just witnessed. I can not stress enough how much I wish for more people to see this movie. It is a masterpiece and a hope for films of the future. The costumes and dancing was breath-taking and the actual skill of Ewan and Nicole's voices were powerful and enjoyable to hear. They seemed to blend and act very well together. The humour had me laughing through the entire first half, whereas during the second half, we were made to concentrate on the drama and love of the couple. The direction was fantastic from the start of the movie, I had to mention Baz Luhrman's great achievement. His creation is a wonder and the script was brilliant. As I have already read of a mans great love for this movie and the way that he felt, I have to say that I feel exactly the same way.

		<fullReview>Having seen this film last night, I still cant get over how good this was.It quite clearly owes more to stage Opera than stage musical, and that is possibly why people feel that it is a disorganised mess with limited plot.Opera plots are very similar to this, with twists and turns complicating simple love stories.The handling of the songs is also much more Operatic, with two people singing different songs at each other, musical refrains occurring and re-occurring throughout.The Roxanne song and dance number was awesome, Ewan McGregor and Jacek Koman singing the same song in very differing styles, whilst Nicole Kidman sings the recurring love theme song.A great film, the style of which will be lost on those who are expecting a musical, when what they get is closer to Opera. A style in which this day and age is ignored by the average movie-goer.Baz Luhrmann has truly opened up a new genre in film with this excellent masterpiece, you would be a fool to miss it, whether you feel it will be your cup of tea or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be a film you either love or hate. I went in there thinking it would be great and fantastic (my boyfriend went in thinking he would hate it). I came out cold and he came out jumping for joy. I knew I was hating it as soon as I started looking at my watch. If I love a film I don't care about the time, but I was clock watching. I didn't enjoy the start of it. Everyone was OTT. It was everywhere. I understand that it was supposed to be a crazy time. It did my head in. One could argue, it is a musical and it is a theatrical piece. Bobbins! It still was trying too hard at the start. Got to say that Nicole made a good entrance, but for some one with Consumption, she had a good set of lungs on her and looked well. As if! Do you know, but when I was little I always thought that Consumption was something that people who ate too much food got. Anyway, that aside. I like how they did new songs in the old setting, but I hated how they kept enveloping different songs into each other. And (perhaps it's because I'm a female and it is the law that females end up hating female leads if they are very beautiful), but I felt no sympathy for Nicole's Satine. I just couldn't wait for her to die. She was a completely cold character that was not sold on me at all. I thought that John Leguzi-whats-his-face was fab at Toulouse Lautrec and the Narcoleptic was a great part also. I preferred Romeo+Juliette and Strictly Ballroom. They wiped the floor with this film. Perhaps it's just me not "getting" it, but it was not the best film I saw this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a terrible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you value your intelligence, don't go to see this film. It is a bore. I wanted to walk out after the first 5 minutes.The film starts off like a pop video. The pace is so fast it is annoying, but when it slows down all that is left is the most boring and trite love story.All the colour, noise and music might excite some people but it cannot disguise the emptiness of the plot.And Ewan McGregor's singing voice is just awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film looks great - it is visually superb but I have to agree with many other viewers - some of the editing takes away from the dance scenes and everything tends to blur into a colourful mess. However sets aside the actual film is pretty weak - the singing is mediocre at best and the storyline is not exactly original. I didn't believe that there was this great love between Kidman and McGregor. Definitely one to see in the cinema but in terms of depth not much there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magnificent mess!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, does a magnificent mess mean that it's good or bad? I wrote the words and even I'm still not sure about it. On the one hand I think it will win Oscars; on the other, I feel I could tear it apart. At least it's different. And I did like Kylie Minogue's minute on screen - what a good Tinker Bell she would have made. I'm not going to say anything constructive, clever, or scathing about 'Moulin Rouge'. I feel it is a film that people should see, to make up their own mind, as at least it's not a sequel, and it is different from the run-of-the-windmill stuff. I just hope Nicole Kidman gets best actress for this. At the same time, I think Ewan McGregor is a good ObiWanKenobi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depends on what you expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I come from Europe and my perspective is invariably different. To see a U.S. movie based on one of France's biggest attractions, turned into a legend, is quite unusual. It makes it even more unusual to find out that neither the director, nor the main actors are from France.This is like making "The Patriot" with German actors. Evenso, this is not "Moulin Rouge"'s main problem because apart from the truly amazing editing and camera, and John Leguizamo, this piece of art is a bit too shaky.I say for probably the 100th time that Nicole Kidman is a very unstable actress when it comes to delivering a truly good performance. Indeed, she has her moments, but in fact sucks in playing a courtesan(for those of you unaware- this is something like a prostitute). Her image is far from both Julia Roberts' Vivian Ward("Pretty Woman") and Jodie Foster's Iris("Taxi Driver"). They possesed charisma with intelligence, whereas Kidman has only unlimited sex appeal and beautiful eyes. That's certainly not enough. To top it off, she doesn't sing her songs(more on that later).Second of all, Ewan McGregor who is otherwise very strong in his roles(Ah, that "Trainspotting") seems very "lost in the action". He does have his strong moments(mostly in the end), but is mostly lost behind John Leguizamo's performance. Speaking of Leguizamo, I have to admit he is more than convincing as the short in stature, but large at heart Toulouse Lautrec. What drove me more than mad is that most people don't even know who he actually was(YES- he was a real person, one of France's most celebrated artists, who died of syphilis). Anyway, Leguizamo deserves at least a few major nominations for secondary character(hint for the Academy).I'm not even discussing the songs in the movie(great classics- pretty lame arrangement) because except for "Roxanne" everything pretty much fell behind the originals.However, it is not the songs that bother you, it is the fakeness of the performance. Why do you have to make Ewan and Nicole's voices seem so heavenly- IT'S SO NOT REAL!Every time I am asked about a musical, I give "Dancer in the Dark" as an example- pure, simple, brilliant(but that's another topic).So, as a whole the movie indeed leaves an impression, that regretfully is not lasting. The motion, the action, the colors are very vivid, but i doubt they amount up to what Moulin Rouge was like a 100 years ago. It was something unforgettable, something this movie is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly satisfying fairy tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are times when you leave the cinema wanting to say that you have just seen the best film ever made. Of course, this is nonsense. The feeling will eventually be replaced by another `best ever' film or a more sober judgment made using a different mix of reason and emotion. Accordingly, I now give stars to my films and Moulin Rouge deserves the full five stars - which certainly does not mean it is beyond criticism. The opening is reminiscent of many a Walt Disney film as we are taken across the rooftops of Paris and down into its nineteenth century streets. To complain that there are aspects of the story which are not original is to miss the point. This is fairytale territory. And to confirm the fact Moulin Rouge has its own tinkerbell in the green fairy. The genius of Baz Luhrmann is to make something so original out of ingredients which are in themselves so unoriginal. The music illustrates the point. The soundtrack is, of course, one sustained and highly successful musical joke. Much of the humour in the film comes from the choice of songs and the audience plays along wondering what might come next, how it is going to be arranged, and how it is going to be used in this film. Luhrmann has trawled through popular music, ripping pieces from here and there and pasting them back into a highly successful collage of sound. On its own the soundtrack is nothing special, the CD is a disappointment, but in the film it dances hand in hand with a visual fiesta. Photography and editing combining to make this a truly spectacular (spectacular) film. (**Possible spoiler**) The tone of the film moves from comedy to tragedy and the audience stops laughing at the choice of songs. The ending is now predictable as it must be in all tragedy. In the musical within the film we are warned that it is futile to change the ending of a fairy tale to something else. Baz Luhrmann shows that an even more satisfying ending can be achieved by ignoring that advice. The stars shine, although Nicole Kidman shines just a little brighter than Ewan McGregor. Both surprise and delight with their singing, so much so that one wonders how much technological assistance was required to bring about the result. Not that it really matters. For all its success I doubt if this film has what it is necessary to make it a classic. Classics are replayed in 50 years time. Long before then many of the songs on the soundtrack will have been forgotten and when that happens what is such a pleasurable mix today will be little more than a confusing rag-bag of unrecognised clippings. But until then this is a film to be enjoyed again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I went to see Moulin Rouge after a day at the mall, and we were absolutely blown away by it. Who would have thought that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman had such wonderful singing voices! The whole premise was a good one, it was beautifully executed and we're going to see it again next weekend, this time taking my brother and his wife. Nicole Kidman has never looked better than in this film, and you have to wonder about the sanity of her ex-husband that he's willing to dump her. I hope that this film will eventually get Shawshank-like recognition and kudos, because I can't understand why US critics gave it the cold shoulder. It's a masterpiece of a film.</fullReview>

The MTV-meets-musical style of editing totally spoils the sumptuous sets and the abilities of the stars.Are we right in assuming that all the money went into the stars and the sets? Because this is a musical, there is a great opportunity for the CD of the film. But the music is virtually all unoriginal. It's good, but it should be new.And why, oh why, does a top notch star? such as Nicole, need glycerine to simulate tears. Olivier always asked the question - "can't you act yourself to cry?"It wasn't until Roxanne that we began to enjoy the movie, the characters were just too slapstick.We both loved Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliet, but we walked away from Moulin Rouge disappointed.From my own point of view, I would have been happy to walk out...</fullReview>

I have to admit the first time I saw the trailer for this film, I wasn't too thrilled about it. I had heard numerous rumors that the film was overbudget and honestly, it just wasn't good. Boy was I surprised! From the opening logo, it pulls you right into it's world. The performances of both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are phenomenal. They really keep the story moving at such a great pace. Now I have to also admit that I am not a huge fan of musicals but this one takes the cake. The music is extraordinary and both stars capture the feeling so well of each song they sing. I was so impressed with the art direction, costume design and everything. It's great film, not for everyone though. Give it a chance though, i'm sure you'll love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who would've thought a 2 hour sing-song could be so good?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last year Gladiator swept the board at the Oscars as critics heralded a return to classic cinema. So if the old Roman epic could be successful again, then how about a musical?Ewan McGregor stars as Christian, a young writer living in 1899 Paris. He opts to write a play and is drawn into the sexy underground world of the Moulin Rouge club where he falls for the highest paid star, Satine (Kidman). Their love affair cannot last however as the Duke who owns the deed to the club insists on claiming Satine as his own.In today's cinematic style, you might think that a two-hour sing-song holds little relevance, yet the musical tributes take in everything from The Beatles to Nirvana to Madonna and on the whole come out unscathed and entertaining. The whole basis of the film is also helped, of course, by the fact that Nicole and Ewan really can sing. The lavish costumes and careful attention to detail is reminiscent of something from the golden age of cinema, yet director Baz Luhrmann's style is full of colour, vibrancy and energy, taking a 1930's ideal and using the possibilities of modern technology to show it's full appeal.The true stars though are without doubt Nicole and Ewan. The pair have a genuine talent for delicate comedy yet also maintain terrific on-screen chemistry: and it is this where the real spark in the film lies.The scene with Christian reading his poetry to Satine oozes sex appeal from Kidman's part while McGregor's facial expressions amuse at the same time. It is a credit to both of them as well as Luhrmann that they can take this setting and evolve it into an incredibly touching serenade before reverting back to the funniest scene in the movie.There are a few quibbles: the first 45 minutes is perhaps too muddled, certain characters (Toulouse Lautrec) are sorely under used, and it is slightly too long, but ultimately these are minor indifferences compared to what is a truly remarkable spectacle. Luhrmann together with joint writer Craig Pearce have written what is almost worthy of a Shakespearean tragedy as they blend delicate humour with a touch of romance and ultimate heartbreak. After a summer of movie indifference, Moulin Rouge has proved the light at the end of the tunnel as finally cinema-goers can have something to appreciate.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Musicals have always been sentimentalism of the worst kind, and sentimentality is - don't forget this - "the feeling that cannot go on more" (W. Benjamin). In comparison to the ironic adaptation of the genre that has made Woody Allen, or to the powerful "tragedization" made by Lars von Trier, Baz Luhrmann, as always tasteless and free of esthetic inhibitions, uses the musical to retell unbearable stories: Nicole Kidman is, if we think in Greta Garbo o the verbal portraits of Elonora Duse, an ice-cold and uninteresting "Dame aux camelies", Ewan McGregor's character lacks of any interest - everything lays in the eclectic rodeo of camera, costumes and music. There are some original findings, of course, like the "Roxanne!"-Tango or the Madonna imitations, even the fairy-tale-like Quartier Latin... But of course: one who is going to play with EVERYTHING, necessarily will find some golden eggs. The only thing I wonder about is why all the enthusiasts don't see and FEEL the complete childishness and immaturity, the emptiness of the whole event.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed watching Moulin Rouge! and I'm not even into musicals. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman's performances make it worthwhile; I was a great fan of theirs already, but had no idea they could also sing (and so well). The whole film, costumes, dance, jokes, etc., is excellent, and it's so good to watch a movie which doesn't evolve around just car chases, big explosions, martial arts fights, etc. (which seem so common nowadays). The only downside to me was that, although I can understand English quite well, I could hardly understand the actors' lines during the big dance scenes, so had to read the subtitles and miss a little of the (outstanding) visual production. The choice of songs was brilliant, felt really good hearing "your song", "show must go on", "up where we belong", etc... Definitely, a must!</fullReview>

I would even say the story is all right. the standard never dies. too many up-and-downs though.but people, if you say this is the most innovative piece of movie ever made, shame on your ignorance. i even thought the too much intention of trying to make it look "arty" is making this movie even worse, less impressive, barely legible. so there happens the stupidity like john leguizamo doing a dwarf, with his arms in regular length. Ok, the leads are pretty people. but keeping the camera always a foot away from their faces is like saying, "i don't know how to compose the picture so enjoy their beauty".I liked Luhrmann's STRICTLY BALLROOM alot. it's sad to see another good directer being drifted by money power.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, this is one of the most magnificent masterpieces ever made. Musical dramas have been pretty rare for the past 10 years, because of this, Moulin Rouge becomes a unique movie viewing experience. The direction is in many ways similar to that of Romeo &amp; Juliet (after all, both flicks were made by the same director). Though actor performances are somewhat exaggerative in the first half of the show, their performances in the latter half more than makes up for it. The production design is ornately resplendent, not to mention the striking costumes. I call this "a common love story repackaged in a new way". This is a must-see!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sorry to be among the few not liking this film, as I think the concept is absolutely terrific; this is a type of movie I am very disposed to like, and there certainly was a great deal of fantastic images going on in this film, all of which have been duly commented upon elsewhere.But the film has no soul, no heart, no authenticity. It's a whirlwind and a frenetic pastiche, and completely failed to grab me emotionally. The love story left me completely unmoved. Was there a single word of French spoken in this movie? Nothing about this film said "Paris" to me. I loved the idea of integrating modern songs into this setting, but with a few exceptions (most notably "Like a Virgin" and "Gaite Parisienne"), the results were contrived, gimmicky and awkward. This is a computer driven film, shallow and superficial, aimed at teenagers. Too bad, as there are some great moments, especcally the opening and closing credits! Things could have been improved greatly by a much better leading lady. But Nicole Kidman is absolutely terrible in this film. She exhibited, in my opinion, absolutely no charisma or charm whatsoever, and can't sing. Her part was too important to ignore. Ewan McGregor, on the other hand, is outstanding. Few of the supporting cast were particularly appealing to me either. Style over substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT Moulin Rouge; where the old and rich go to dance with the young and the beautiful. Well, perhaps, not all so very young, and not all beautiful, but wild looking in any case. That, which starts with the drawing of the red curtain, soon turns into a swirl of skirts and colored doll faces as Christian enters that wild sacred realm. At first the unsuspecting audience is sure to feel much of the same confusion as the poetical hero. Peeping colored faces poking out of a hole in the ceiling; sexy green fairies; clowns; a hyperactive short guy; a hyperactive tall mean guy; a hyperactive pimp stile boss; some hyperactive swirls of skirt. Hyperactive faces; hyperactive redhead making love to a blanket; hyperrrr r r? And just when one thought the movie would swirl away into oblivion till the end all slows down and ?tis time for a love song, and then another, and then the story is on. Does the hyperactiveness return, by all means, but by that time one is ready for it and does not feel like they are hit on the head continually with a diamond covered gold bat. Now? We break it down.Story- is very unoriginal, the most unoriginal element about all of this movie, in fact. (possible spoiler) Boy meets girl, boy and girl from different ends of the meat rack of life, boy loves girl, girl loves boy, another boy loves girl who is from her side of the meat rack, girl chooses love boy number 1, something happens to make girl choose the other nasty bad boy but does not tell our hero why she does. Girl inevitably chooses hero boy and they live happily ever after, ups... Well, no, actually this is the other variation where the girl dies and the boy lives on to tell about it (think Titanic). Obviously, the movie is a love story plain and simple like many others, so what is special about this one? Filming/art- is absolutely exquisite. The hyperactiveness defiantly works to catch one's attention even if one hates it all along they are sure to be windswept by it. Wonderful effects such as the black and whitish beginning that all of a sudden gains color. The life is like oxygen speech comes on and? Ups! Confused face on Christian, guy drops though roof, it turns into a comedy of sorts! All this being very very well filmed the whole wile. Alright, so, when it does slow down by the end, say, after the tango scene, (SPOILER) one starts to think to oneself, alright, die already. Let me just tell you, Satine does not die until it is obvious she is going to, so do not fight! But, enough of that. Music: is very very nicely put together. Moulin Rouge seems to capture within itself all the popular music of the 20th century and mixes it up within each other to present it in a surprisingly tasteful blend. Some songs are especially amusing to listen to for they surely parody the original (ahm, Like a Virgin). Verdict? Even though the plot is not original, the love plot never is. Simply put, this movie did all it possibly could have out of a very obvious plot line, both where acting was concerned, artistically, and in filming, they even mixed in a little comedy which was a big surprise to myself. If you like colorful swirling movies, watch it, If you are a very old couple walking on stilts between mortality and death and get a heart attack at the drop of a hat (or the throw of a hat) stay away from this one and continue with the every day Days Of Our Lives.</fullReview>

They 'threw themselves' into the role and made Luhrman's vision come to life. This would make a fantastic musical for the West End and Broadway!! Beware of the soundtrack though..... the songs work wonderfully on screen but not so well on CD with no visuals to help create the mood.

		<fullReview>The cast is marvelous, it's filmed beautifully, and it was a lot of fun to watch. The way modern songs are adapted into the movie is a riot. The pace is breakneck and rarely drags, but the story is a little too simplified. But from the start it's supposed to be about love, and the movie sticks to that one theme like glue. It's a fun movie. Watch it if you're in the mood for something light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wish there were more movies like this! (contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of musicals. I wish they were still in vogue in film. I was a little nervous to watch this movie because of the use of today's popular music, but it's really amazing how well the songs worked. (Although, I will agree with another commenter that "Like a Virgin" was a little out of place, but I thought it was one of the funniest pieces in the film, so it made up for it!) I enjoyed the music so much that I bought the soundtrack two days later and I love it! Then I went back and saw the film a couple of weeks later and loved it even more. It was very tempting to sing along with the music, but I managed to contain myself (although I mouthed along during a couple of parts). I have but two complaints for Moulin Rouge: the version of "Lady Marmalade" used in the actual film (the one mixed in with "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and the Fatboy Slim song) is much more fun to listen to than the version that actually appears in the soundtrack. I have half a mind to email Baz Luhrmann and ask him what's up with that. ENTER SPOILER HERE: Also, I'm not too fond of disease aspect of the film. It seems like disease is the #1 choice in knocking off main characters in film today. And I thought Satine and Christian deserved better. I like happy endings personally, and it broke my heart that one minute they were so ultimately happy together (as the play is ending) and the next Satine was in her final moments. Okay, end complaints here. Moulin Rouge was entertaining the whole way through. I love Ewan McGregor's voice! And his smile just made me (and the group of girls I went to see it with) melt. The acting was great (I especially liked John Leguizamo's Toulouse-Latrec), it was visually appealing, and the singing was spectacular on all counts. I will definitely be seeing this again! This movie rocks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most refreshing movie I've seen in YEARS! OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCES! AND KILLER SOUNDTRACK!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman is Satine. For the 2 hours we sit in our chairs we are blown away by Nicole Kidman's amazing acting talent as well as her killer singing voice. Ewan McGregor performs the role of Christian perfectly, packed with an amazing singing voice. The film is the hit of 2001, a box-office and merchandising smash. The Soundtrack since May 2001 has been on the best-selling list for months. The film has had three radio smash's, the film's hit song "Lady Marmalade" by Cristina Aguilera, Pink, Lil Kim, and Mya - "Come What May" by Kidman and McGregor, and VH1 and radio hit "Elephant Love Medley" by Kidman and McGregor. The story is amazing for a musical. What more can be said. It was one of those few films that has given me goosebumps during and after viewing. *****/***** for Nicole Kidman and *****/***** for the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Learn to love LOVE again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The summer of 2001 was, as most critics will wholeheartedly disagree, a fairly reasonable season for the movies. Sure, we've had some giant disappointments ("Pearl Harbor", "Planet of the Apes" anyone?) but hey, 1999 had both "Wild Wild West" and "Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace" in the same summer, so 2001 can hardly have that held against it. Then, there have been some highlights this summer as well. "A Knight's Tale" was some fun relief at the summer's opening, as well as "Shrek", the ultimately hilarious CGI-film that surprised all who saw it, and then there was "The Fast and the Furious", which can hardly be called an excellent film but was widely praised for its supercharged action sequences.With impressive summer movies already put on my shoulders, there was one film missing in my so-called repertoire... I had been waiting to see it all year long. It was "Moulin Rouge", a musical, of all things, directed by the man responsible for the dance-masterpiece "Strictly Ballroom" and the bleak vision of society's association with William Shakespeare, 1996's "Romeo + Juliet". With all the hype behind it, and the fact that it was a Baz Luhrmann film, AND the fact that I had been waiting all year to see it, I could not afford to be disappointed... and I wasn't. This fantastic film was all I expected and much, much, MUCH more!First, the story. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is a poor writer who deceives his father by moving to Montmartre, France, circa 1899. He has "demenaged" to this "city of sin", hoping to indulge the four things he believes make life worth living: truth, beauty, freedom and love. Once there, he moves into an apartment directly below the dwarvish French artist, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo, nothing short of hilarious in his diminutive role), who is conceiving a mass-production for the notorious nightclub across the street, the "Moulin Rouge". Henri's problem: his star and associate writer is a narcoleptic Argentinian (Jacek Koman). After the Argentinian falls asleep through the floor into Christian's room below, Toulouse-Lautrec commissions Christian to help them out in writing the production they call "Spectacular Spectacular!" Christian, seeing he has little choice in the matter, agrees to do so, and leaves an indelible impression upon Toulouse when Christian - dressed in Lederhosen and mounted above cardboard Swiss Alps - electrifies their creativity as he sings "The hills are alive - with the sound of music!" Toulouse and his compatriates feel it is time for Christian to propose the production to the nightclub's owner, Harold Zidler (a very flamboyant and eye-catching Jim Broadbent).Once Christian enters the Moulin Rouge, he is immediately captured by this nightclub of dreams. The can-canning ladies enter the room belting out "Lady Marmalade" with a background techno beat by Fatboy Slim, while at the same time the men seeking pleasure in these women burst into the room with their own, hyped-up, rousing version of Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit". This is a nightclub that would capture anyone, anyday, anytime, anywhere... even in our modern, shallow society that couldn't bare to get their money's worth with this masterpiece of a film.But anyway, on with the summary! In the midst of this frantic foray, the jewel of Christian's eye in this nightclub is the marvelously gorgeous Satine (Nicole Kidman). She stumbles into his life looking like Marilyn Monroe on a trapeze, all the while singing Monroe's own "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend". In a mysterious set of circumstances, Christian is arranged a meeting with this diva, and in turn captures her heart with his uncanny obsession with love and all he knows about it. This soon becomes a problem when the Duke of Worcestor (Richard Roxburgh) becomes aware. The Duke is the one whom Zidler turns to for investment in the nightclub. It is the Duke who will provide finances for "Spectacular Spectacular!", but he'll only do it with a contract binding Satine's talents... and her body... to him. Christian and Satine, in turn, are forced to hide their love from the Duke so that the show can go on, Satine can be made into a star, and the two can go on, loving each other beyond time itself, happily... ever... after.Had enough? I've only scratched the surface in terms of what there remains to be seen in "Moulin Rouge". This film, by all terms, is the perfect one for all who find their niche in the performing arts, whether it be music, acting, writing, or even loving itself. Conservatives, anal-retentives, and nitpickers I bid you beware... you'll be indulged by all that you may find to complain about with in the film. Perhaps "Moulin Rouge" is an allegory for Baz Luhrmann's true mission as a filmmaker. It seems to me that Baz Luhrmann is an ambassador of love for all who cease to understand it. Think about it a moment, all his films have the underlying subject of love (in "Strictly Ballroom" and "Romeo + Juliet" it's quite clear, not to mention this one), and in each one he ventures to present the power of love, the pain of love, and the ultimate outcome of it all. He ventures to present every angle of love, not to merely let people know that it is "good", because in some cases he lets us know how painful it is. But in the end, we realize that Maestro Luhrmann's mission is to show all his audiences how to love again, and personally, I believe he's done a far better job here than James Cameron did with "Titanic" or, worse yet, Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer did with "Pearl Harbor"."Moulin Rouge" is a film where there is something for everyone. For singers and music lovers, there are a million songs we have all grown to love (and, in some cases, loathe) over the years, including Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You," U2's "Pride (In the Name of Love)," Eden Ahbez' "Nature Boy," (performed in this case by David Bowie), and the latter singer's "Diamond Dogs" and "Heroes". (Ironically enough, David Bowie beautifully masters Ahbez' jazz classic "Nature Boy," but he seems to have been kept as far away as possible from singing his own tunes.) For visual-seekers, the production design, costumes, and cinematography are more than enough to satisfy your ravenous eyes. For musical-lovers, there's plenty of reference to musicals past, so you'll definitely find something to identify with here. And, even for the sarcastic and edgy-humored, you'll find much to enjoy with parodies of "Titanic" and other sappy love stories of the past.Whew! I think I've said enough to praise this film. Satan be the name of those who try to discourage me from loving it so dearly. I give "Moulin Rouge" 4 1/2 stars on a five star scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Postmodern masterpiece?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>a frightening look at what the postmodern world of pop-culture can produce. The movie, instead of playing off its plot and characters, relies on the audiences willingness to be distracted by songs who's only claim to fame are that they were ripped from other popular sources. like in any other postmodern work, the orginal meaning is lost through references to references, everything is turned objective. I will say that the blending of these songs into a turn-of-the-century caberet dance hall was brillant. I was disturbed though with many concepts of the movie. Spectacular Spectacular, a spectacle of the spectacle, if that is not postmodern i don't know what is. the camera work is also a product of our time. it is understood that we as a society become distracted easily but our attention spans are quite low. This means that fast images, and actions which don't seem natural excite in us a fight or flight response keeping our attention glued to the screen. And you ask, why am i agianst postmodernism? well, if postmodernism continues indefinatly, which by definition postmodernism must do, then all thought and action will be objectified until all meaning is lost. anything can be turned into pop-culture, even being against pop-culture.I did notice one thing though, was it just me or did it seem that all the major characters were always assaulting the duke with music? no wonder he was on edge and snapped, he was probably experiencing something akin to an LSD acid freakout! all in all a good movie, fun to watch but frighten in its implications.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trying to be as open minded about this 2 hour MTV style fantasy, within the first 10 minutes I could see what I was in for. And "Moulin Rouge" held true to it's overtly cheezy and glitzy tongue-in-cheek style. I'd get more fulfillment from watching MTV for two hours, and I wouldn't feel as if I was wasting my money on someone's cinematic wet dream. Nicole and Ewan's singing and acting was good. It's just too bad it had to be wasted in this wreck of a movie that is obviously trying to be original, but only succeeds in creating a period piece set somewhere between broadway and pop culture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Acting is great but the movie drags on forever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is quite and intriguing new style of film making that caught my eye from the start of the movie. Nearly a thousand different frames fly by your eyes in the beginning of the movie moving from one picture to the next. If you are not alert while watching this movie, you will be visually dazed. The story line is nothing out of the ordinary. Two lovers battle over the same girl and you can pretty much predict the ending except with a little twist.Many people walked out of the theater crying but the movie didn't seem to hit me that much. The visual effects are interesting but the movie seems to bounce around way to much. I found myself rubbing my eyes trying to focus on what was going on but it was hard. The first half of Moulin Rouge is the best part of the movie in my opinion. It is gracefully funny and entertaining. The second half moves along extremely slow for over an hour going back and forth about how much each person loves the girl. It made me sick and wanting to run out of the theater. I thought the ending was never going to come.The acting was superb! Nicole Kidman as Satine does a fantastic acting job throughout the film. I wouldn't be shocked to see her nominated and winning a best actress award when the oscars come around. Ewan McGregor also does a great job acting. Though a singing voice is patched in over his because after this movie is a musical.Overall, I was entertained for the first half of the movie but then the love story took over and I started to slide down my chair. The movie moves really fast and at times is quite tedious. If you like love stories and like movies where you cry (girls), you will like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Rouge will blow you away if you're willing to play along. (teeny spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie for anyone willing to give themselves over to the experience.The first time I saw Moulin Rouge, I was literally speechless at the end. After two hours of intense color, sound, and emotion, I came out feeling a bit overwhelmed; very few films have ever had that effect on me.Many of the negative comments I read regarding the film seem to miss the point I think Baz was trying to make. I've read that he based the movie on the opera "Orpheus in the Underworld," which is the actual origin of the "Can-Can" song. In the opera, a young protagonist tries to save his love from a tragic fate but is eventually unsuccessful. See the parallel? It's not supposed to be an original plot.As for the songs, I believe the use of recognizable pop standards allows the audience to experience the Moulin Rouge as the true center of pop-culture that it was. I can't imagine today's audience getting fired up by some Offenbach.Additionally, by beginning and ending the film with a curtain, he presents the film as a stage show or opera, thus allowing for the archetypal plot and familiar songs.I personally loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone looking for something unique. It's not perfect, but it's got a lot of heart and has the nerve to be different. Kidman and McGregor give amazing performances. Love it or hate it, you won't soon forget it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not fond of watching this type of movie! But after reading some ranting and raving reviews in the newspaper, I was convinced to watch this movie after Evita :) And indeed in the first 20 minutes of the movie I got nauseated with the camera movements which caused me to sleep! But when the lines of HOW WONDERFUL LIFE IS WHEN YOU'RE IN THE WORLD were sang by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, I was awaken! Never thought that these two could sing! But of course I knew they just synched it anyway! That scene kept me awaken till the end of the movie! Besides, the danceable tune mixes of Lady Marmalade, Material Girl and Rhythm of the Night almost jumped me out of my seat to dance! Indeed Baz Luhrman has changed my perspective on stereotyping musical-drama! He has effectively captured the tunes to get across the message of the movie! At least that windmill will always be remembered as MOULIN ROUGE :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ok. Yes, there were lots of cliches. But they were put together beautifully. The "love conquers all" theme juxtaposed against a story about doomed lovers captured both the romantic spirit of the era and the sadness you feel when those ideals aren't fulfilled. As for the pop songs, I thought they were done in such a way that if you lived in a hole and didn't recognize any of them, you would think they fit in perfectly. Maybe it is a little anachronistic, but THIS IS NOT A CONVENTIONAL MUSICAL! Yes, there is TONS of eye candy and some scenes that will blow your mind. I won't repeat what's already been said about it. When I saw this movie with three of my friends who have very different tastes, all four of us were in awe of everything walking out. None of us really care for musicals that much. But this film is an experience. Don't pass it by.</fullReview>

It's all very well for the first half hour, but after that one realizes that there's nothing here that we haven't alrady seen in the trailers.

		<shortDescription>Some original music would be nice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess Baz Luhrmann assumes that the majority of movie-goers won't appreciate a revival of the cinematic musical unless it is filled to the gills with melodies and lyrics that we are already familiar with. Original compositions are a good thing! Really, they are! Practically every other film has more original music on the soundtrack than this movie. It's also history mangling, how am I supposed to suspend my disbelief that this is Paris in 1899, when I keep hearing music from the 70's and 80's? Don't get me wrong, the arrangements were written and performed faithful to the spirit of the Broadway musical. At least they got that part right. Well maybe I shouldn't take the whole thing too seriously, but I WAS hoping for a somewhat more original story too. *spoiler* Ok so Nicole starts coughing up blood, gee what's going to happen at the end? Two people from different classes fall in love but it is ultimately doomed? *yawn* A writer changes the play to reflect his own affairs...gosh that's never happened before. Is it all bad? No, it's beautifully filmed, with rich, exquisite colors. I laughed a few times, especially when the duke stomps on the frog in an effort to impress Satine. Leguizamo is also an unexpected treat. Unless you are a fan of the musical, don't bother with this one. If you ARE a fan, then you probably have already seen it. If not, just be prepared that you might be disappointed.</fullReview>

She's surrounded by good actors and funny characters. What about Ziddler, and Toulouse-Lautrec!!! The sets are enchanting. It's like a big fairy tale. Funny the gun that klinks on the Eiffel tower! Of course, there's a lot of clichés («I'm dying Christian») but who cares, it's made up to be that way. Parody of musicals but also of classic litterature. Funny to use songs like Madonna's «Like a Virgin» in a movie about a nightclub in 1899 in Paris, France! Great songs, well chosen. I enjoy myself very much at this movie. I like the way the movie begin and finish with the curtain and the orchestra conductor. The entire generic is nice too.Out of 100, I gave it 83. That's *** on a **** stars rating system.

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is one of the greatest experiences you will ever see presented on the silver screen. That is exactly what Moulin Rouge is, an experience, not a movie, but more of an experience that makes you believe in the awesome power of Truth, Beauty, Feedom, and Love. Baz Luhrmann's film allows the audience to go on a magical and awe-inspiring journey through the Bohemian Revlolution in 1900 Paris. We meet a young, pennyless poet named Christian, who travels to Paris to be a part of this renaissance of sorts. Christian moves into a small room across from the world famous Moulin Rouge nightclub, where he meets a small band of bohemians (no pun intended) who he helps write a show. Eventualy Christian meets Satine, a cortesan from the Moulin Rouge. The two become secret lovers and attepmt to foil the plans of the jelous Duke, who is financing the bohemian's play. The plot of Moulin Rouge takes a backseat to this mystical maze of song and dance that is executed with excellence. This is one film worth seeing, because it does what few films have ever done. It makes you believe in the power of film.</fullReview>

I thought it was pretty good, but I'm a Kidman fan, even more since she's single?anyone want to introduce me? One more thing?the theme of this movie was summed up in one line: `It's a story about love?..at the Moulin Rouge.' Ya know, this `line' could've been used for another 2001 summer flick: `It's a story about love?..at Pearl Harbor!' (Needed to get at least one more shot at that movie!) B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was dragged to this movie by a girlfriend so, needless to say, I wasn't expecting much of anything. While I enjoyed Baz Luhrman's "Romeo and Juliet," I wasn't part of the masses of people that thought it was a towering achievement. Before I saw MR, I heard they were using current pop songs ("Like a virgin,""Roxanne") in the soundtrack and was very skeptical. Well I must say is was much better than I expected, and just about all the pop songs fit very well, with the possible exception of "Like a virgin," which was totally unnecessary. I actually liked this film a lot, and was very happy that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sang their own parts. The visual style displayed is key, but not the only drawing point, and therefore works well within the context of the famous French nightclub. My only complaint really was that it was about 20 minutes too long. With a TRT of over 2 hours, the plot is just not thick enough to support this length, and therefore becomes a major detractor. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about this movie? Personally, I hate musicals. No, more accurately, I loathe them. I've never been a fan of Broadway or any sort of showtunes whatsoever. When you've dated someone who used to sing them 24-7, maybe you willingly begin to despise them; Call me close-minded, but I assumed this film would be along those lines, and during the opening scene, I was almost blown away. I have never seen a movie like this in my entire life - and praise to Baz for having the cajones to make this film, he deserves an Oscar for it. The acting was superb, and who knew Nicole and Ewan could even sing? I could ramble on and on and use big words to describe how beautiful I thought this movie was, but that's just it in one word: beautiful. Go see it, I recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers This is one of the greatest musicals I have ever seen! Moulin Rouge successfully mixes drama with humor, joy, suspense, and a beautiful soundtrack (I want to own this cd!). Unlike most dramas, which wallow in constant pity and remorse, Moulin Rouge has its truly exciting, fun moments, such as (SPOILERS ahead) the joyous dance scene at the end of the play.When Sertine finally dies, the viewer feels a sense of pain, yet joy, at the fact that she died happily and with her wish come true. There could have been many alternative endings- for example, the bad guy could have shot Sertine in the middle of her joyous finale dance. The writers decided to satisfy the viewers' hopes, for a change, and I'm glad that they gave us the ending we yearned to see. My favorite line: "The best thing in the world is to love, and to be loved in return!" That one should go down in the history books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have recently seen this movie and was NOT impressed. I'm not a big fan of Nicole Kidman to begin with--in fact the only movie she's done that I enjoyed was To Die For and her upcoming The Others looks rather promising--save those two, no dice. The movie is an intense jumble of emotions that leaves the viewer with a headache. There are many shots when the effect they are going for reminds one of running with a video camera--I paid good money for a bunch of blurry shots? My six-year-old could create the same effect. I was rather excited about the fact that it is a musical but once the music starts, it's very disappointing. "Musical" renditions of Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and Madonna's "Like A Virgin" are not what I go to see in a musical. I'm looking for the originality of Rodgers and Hammerstein or other great musical writers, not 20th century songs plopped in 1900.The only saving grace of this movie was Ewan McGregor. His acting was superb in comparison to Nicole Kidman's boring courtesan character. John Leguizamo's character was also entertaining at rare times. This is the first movie I have ever had to fight to stay awake for. My advice: skip it or wait for it to come out in a discount theatre. Watching grass grow is more entertaining than this film--and I simply ADORE musicals! This one's a disgrace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear reader,The first time all saw this film, I was totally blown away by the story, the music, and the script. Although the story is about "Truth, Beauty, Freedom and Love", the director masterfully shapes these four mutually contradictory principles into a smooth cinematic experience.I have seen this film 18 times and plan to see it again and again. I plan to buy the DVD but it will not be the same as seeing it on the big screen. Some films, like this one, were meant to be seen on the big screen.Just lose yourself in the music and feel the film!I hope that Interscope puts out another CD of the film's music, because the current CD does not do the film's music justice. "Come what may" is a beautiful song and I want to listen to the film's many version of that song. Also, the Green Fairy's solo of the "hills are alive" is absolutely sexy! Another song missing from the CD.In short go see the film. If you have, then go see it again. Life is too short.Long live the Bohemian revolution!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the best musical since My Fair Lady!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best musical since My Fair Lady! In the pop culture tradition of the best postmodern fiction, it is endlessly self-referential, and delightfully merges just about every cultural reference imaginable with each of their antecedents. Madonna and Monroe are unified in a psuedo-drag number that objectifies every drag queen who ever did the same to the originals. And oh, those songs! From the Material Girl to the Rocket Man, and everything in between, with totally acceptable performances by all involved. If you love good music, you'll love some of the best all over again as you see it in a context you never imagined.Ewan McGregor is absolutely enchanting as the young writer attempting to break into the Paris arts circle that inhabits the Moulin Rouge. He infuses his character with warmth and sincerity that makes him by far the most endearing character on film in recent memory, and in a world not gone mad, would all but guarantee him the Oscar this year. In a surprise trick casting, we have Nicole Kidman as an ambitious whore who compensates for meager talent by her willingness to enter a sham relationship in exchange for fame and fortune. Where does she find her inspiration? She reaches somewhere inside and finds something to make it work, and work it does in far and away her best role since she was again surprisingly cast as a scheming conniving bitch in Malice. They just keep coming out of the blue.There isn't a single cast member who isn't stellar, and the pace and density of the production, although at times a little trying, is an embarrassment of riches. Watch for John Leguizamo's touching speech about love as the unloved Toulouse Lautrec. He should be getting much bigger and better roles, and maybe this will open some doors.Although a must own on the eventual DVD, this is also a big-screen experience that cannot be missed. It is everything a great musical should be, and everything all great musicals have been, all rolled into one. An absolute treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not So Spectacular! Not So Spectacular!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those infuriating movies - like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - that are very good where they're good, and very bad where they're bad. It could have been a masterpiece (and hence, Oscar material) but alas!I'll tell you where Moulin Rouge hit the bull's eye, and where it missed the barn by a mile. First, the hits:1. The film began well. Much of the first half of the film is corny, but so what? Corniness by itself doesn't make a movie bad, and in this case, it worked, thanks in large part to Baz Luhrmann's directing.2. By far my favourite part of the movie is the scene in Satine's bedroom (called The Elephant) where she mistakes Christian the penniless writer (Ewan) for the wealthy Duke (Richard Roxburgh). Nicole Kidman as Satine EXCELS here, especially in her orgasmic throes (you'll know what I mean when you see it).3. The supporting cast was by and large very good, especially the Bohemian revolutionaries a.k.a. Ewan's fellow-actors in the play, Spectacular! Spectacular!4. The set was lush and the costumes were opulent, something you would expect to see in a Tim Burton movie.5. The pacing was excellent.So far we've been talking about the first half of the movie, for most of the merits of the movie seem to be found there.Now the misses.1. From the point where Christian the writer meets Satine the courtesan on the roof-top of The Elephant, the movie inexplicably goes downhill. From that point on, the songs lose their punch and the plot just meanders along. In one word, you're liable to be bored stiff, as I was.2. The movie is about Satine's desire to act in a play written by Christian called Spectacular! Spectacular! Yet when the play is finally staged near the end of the movie, we only catch snippets of it. I know the director didn't mean to make a musical, but having built up such incredible expectations among the movie-goers, we should at least have had the chance to watch a major portion of the play. I certainly would have edited out much of the draggy singing that cluttered the second half of the movie, and shown more of the play.3. Similarly, we didn't see enough of the can can. Since the Moulin Rouge was famous for this, we should have been treated to a more or less complete can can dance. Instead we got little flashes here and there which were more annoying and headache-inducing than entertaining. Recall the flashes of flamenco dancing in the John Woo debacle, Mission Impossible 2, and you'll know what I mean.4. The plot was moronically predictable. You could see the ending a mile away. Worse, it was boring.Some specifics now.Nicole Kidman acted very well, I must say, though I'm not a fan of hers. Ewan McGregor was quite good, especially at the end of the movie where Satine died in his arms - his wailing was the best I'd heard since Mel Gibson's in The Patriot. I liked Richard Roxburgh as the Duke. (By the way, Roxburgh is the actor in Mission Impossible 2 whose finger was cut off with the bad guy's cigar-cutter.) It was nice to see Roxburgh get a meatier role than what he had in MI:2 and that he could act as well in a tragicomedy as in an action movie. Jim Broadbent, as Harold Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge, was outstanding. I hope he gets nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars.And now the golden question: can the stars sing? Well, I thought Nicole had a pretty good singing voice. She sounded like Madonna, only better. Ewan sang a version of Elton John's My Song and sang it well. But that was the only song he sang well. The rest was just monotonous bellowing.Sadly the movie didn't come up with much original music. There were plenty of spoofs e.g. Madonna's Like A Virgin, but surely an expensive movie such as Moulin Rouge deserves some good original music.I read somewhere on IMDb.com that the Roxanne tango was the greatest thing in the movie. Well, my movie partner thought so too. But sorry, it just didn't grab me.Certainly not on a par with The Sound Of Music, I'd give ML 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review of the magical film Moulin Rouge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With it's sweeping screen shots, and lavish scenery, Moulin Rouge promises to take any viewer willing to let go of reality on a magical journey through love and Bohemianism. At first glance, the film does come across as being a bit grandious, yet after you actually allow the film to take you away, one will almost completely forget how shallow the exterior of the film is.I was not exactly sure about Moulin Rouge when I finally went to see it. I had wanted to see it since I had first viewed the theatrical trailer. When the film started I thought to myself, ``This is gonna be worse than Romeo &amp; Juliet.`` Suprisingly, once them film really got going, which in my opinion was when Christian downed the liquer with the green faerie on the lable and Bono and Gavine Friday's cover of ``The Children of the Revolution`` faded in, I knew that this film would be an experience I would not soon forget.Of course, I have a deep passion for film and the innovative ways of contemporary film making. Therefore, I was immediately enticed with this film. Throughout Moulin Rouge, I felt as though I had gone to see a play on Broadway, it was simply that beautiful. I began to feel each characters struggles and flaws. In the end, I was a heartbroken as our hero, Christian was.When, at long last, the curtain closed and the end credits began to flash dully onto the movie screen, no one moved. Of course, it was 12:45 at night, and only ten other people were in the theatre. Still, no one moved to leave, they only sat there, as though allowing what had just happened to fully sink in.Moulin Rouge, unlike other love tragedies, such as Romeo &amp; Juliet, did not even out in the end. Christian and Satine were not joined together in death. Instead, Christian survives, in a world where survival is all, writing, telling the world about his love for the most beautiful woman he had ever known. The woman who had first taught him to love, who had taken all hope from him, and had left him with only a memory. A memory that he would cherish forever. A memory that is Moulin Rouge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like "A Knight's Tale" before it, "Moulin Rouge" uses anachronistic music to tell its story. "Unlike A Knight's Tale", however, "Moulin Rouge" actually makes it work from time to time, but it's not enough to save the movie.Set at the famous nightclub in 1899 Paris, "Moulin Rouge" tells the story of the love between Christian (Ewan McGregor), a young, idealistic writer, and Satine (Nicole Kidman), a dancer who is also the most sought after courtesan at the Moulin Rouge. Also on hand are artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo), Zidler (Jim Broadbent), owner of the Moulin Rouge; and the Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh), who is besotted with Satine.Director and co-writer Baz Luhrmann has created a pretty but uneven movie. The costumes and sets were eye-popping; I only wish he'd decided not to use a Roto-Tiller to edit the movie. Was there a reason why Luhrmann couldn't focus on a dancer for more than one or two seconds? The first half-hour was particularly tough to sit through, all sound and fury with little cohesion. The pacing is problematic, too: after rushing at breakneck speed through the first two acts, the movie lurches from plot point to plot point in the film's final third. The ending felt both rushed and static: the final scenes involving Christian and Satine were slow to the point of being inert, but everything else was hectic and jittery. It felt as if they'd run out of time and couldn't decide how to end it. There was a remarkable lack of chemistry between Kidman and McGregor, or for that matter, anyone else. For all of the gape-mouthed guffawing and rivers of tears the movie shows, it just felt icy to me. I just flat didn't care because the movie's central relationship left me so unmoved. McGregor seemed earnest enough in his role, while Kidman's doomed, consumptive Satine was beautiful but just too remote for me to warm up to her. (She also suffers from "Ali MaGraw in Love Story" disease -- the sicker she gets, the more beautifully lit she gets. But boy, she sings and dances as well as any healthy person.)Oh, and if anyone can tell me what purpose Toulouse-Lautrec served in this movie -- aside from rattling on about "the Bohemian ideal"-- I'd sure like to hear it. Plus, it would have been nice to see more than two minutes of "Spectacular, Spectacular"--they spent almost the entire movie building it up, yet we're shown virtually none of it.Luhrmann also repeats some shots ad nauseam: the pull-way-back, pan-left, zoom-way-in sequence, for example. I lost count of the number of times Luhrmann pulled that trick or its variations. And what was with the annoying sound effects scattered throughout the movie? If I see a dancer executing several quick jetés, I know he's performing a series of leaps; I don't need to hear "doink-doink-doink" on top of it. It just took me right out of the moment. Luhrmann's musical choices are hit-or-miss, as well: some are genuinely cringe-inducing ("Your Song" and especially "Like a Virgin" -- ugh!), while two are beautiful to the point of transcendence ("Roxanne", "The Show Must Go On"). The stars' singing voices are pretty but bland, especially McGregor's and Kidman's. I ho-hummed through their duets. Jacek Koman's Unconscious Argentinian, however, possesses a wonderfully rough, passionate voice that brought the pain and misery of "Roxanne" to wonderful, delirious fruition.So, to sum up this too-long review: "Moulin Rouge"could have been so much more than it was, but Baz Luhrmann just couldn't pull it off. And that's a shame. My grade: C-terry-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in San Francisco, while visiting a friend. He was really fired up about the movie. I thought he was perhaps overselling it, but boy was I wrong!This is an incredibly well made movie. The visuals are stunning and the acting is top-notch. Sure, the plot is old and has been done many times before, but if we go in depth when it comes to plot, we'll have to go all the way back to the beginning of storytelling to find anything original. The story is as old as time itself. Love.The soundtrack may seem a cheap trick to win the crowd, but somehow it doesn't seem wrong. What would have been predictable would have been to compose new songs. In fact, using already popular songs, slightly modified, makes this movie stand out. Why not use popular songs if they capture what you want to say??My final comment would be: see this movie. It is a love story that makes such over-hyped movies as Titanic look like a tale of distant acquaintances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my mind, this movie gets two merits:1. That it was visually stunning, beautifully superficially appealing. By that I mean the settings, cinematography, musical numbers, were all brilliant. 2. That it had one of the most predictable, corny, rehashed plotlines I've ever seen, was full of romantic rubbish that would normally make a cynical type like me nauseous - and yet this was all pulled off so well, and with such skill, that I didn't even mind it. (To say "one of the most", I admit though, is pretty unfair, considering the state of most efforts at movies nowadays - let's just say that it didn't particularly surprise me, and, at least theme-wise, didn't really seem to step out of the mold).So that would be my only grievance: Yes, the plot is corny, yes, the theme is simple, and the random-spontaneously-combusting passion that occurs between the two main characters is very cliche. This one gripe aside, I will now try to express why the movie is worth seeing even despite this seemingly major flaw.The visual effects are to die for. So many scenes just dazzle with color and beauty - every detail, from ridiculously lavish interiors and buildings down to the costuming, is breathtaking. Definitely worth seeing on the big screen - it is a celebration of movement and color.It is filmed in an interesting and unique way - not so different as to alienate its viewers, the all simplistic general public - but a refreshing change from your everyday style. Combine these with excellent choreography and the Moulin Rouge is a whirlwind of textures....a sort of living scrapbook is the only kind of way I can describe it.The singing is surprisingly good. Kidman shines. I didn't think too much of McGregor's voice, but he pulls it off well as well. The inclusion of contemporary songs works so well, no one could even think of criticizing anachronism.The movie is cheesy: but when it's cheesy, it's glossed to perfection. The love ballads are set in the stars, glitter and rosepetals galore, with big corny musical numbers inspiring emotion and awe despite themselves.And it's funny, too. Spoofs galore - hilarious in contex.I don't know anything about excellent acting, so I won't presume myself informed enough to lecture you all on that. But from what I, in my simple peasant ways, can see, Moulin Rouge is a fantastic effort. The inherent "cheesiness" of the plotline is never evident; everything is believable, and earnest. I don't think the plot has any major surprises, but the strands of the story are interwoven skillfully. It dazzles, enthralls, and flows beautifully....and worth every penny to see it in full glory on the big screen.Moulin Rouge has something for everyone, I think...innovative camera work for the film techniquers, visual splendor for the eye-candyists, lots of sparkles, music for the musical lover as well as the contemporary music lover - contemp. music placed so innovatively throughout the film, a heartfelt story for the romanticists, a comedy for those who want light entertainment.And even for cynics like me, always on the prowl to find originality and abuse cliches....for taking something so, so simple, and creating a great and enduring, and penultimately lovable film.</fullReview>

The Roxanne Tango is amazing. See it at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is why I go to the movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A tremendous love story; the best production value the movie industry has to offer; a consistent, unique style, which was campy and romantic without being particularly trite; superb acting (and singing!) by a dazzling Nicole Kidman and a beautiful, sincere Ewan McGregor; a self-assured sense of story that didn't feel the need to explain, or cover, or be sly; and the music!Walking out of the theater, the only problem I expected most folks to have is if the movie did a cover of a song that they had a personal attachment to; as for me, I felt the movie was simply one song too long. But the ending was brilliant.Go see it, relax, and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sleazy and technically inept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The bankrupt mess that is "Moulin Rouge": A short catalog.The nominal heroes claim that they stand for four "Bohemian principles" of "truth, beauty, freedom and love." Which of these are they illustrating when they approach a wealthy man with the stated intention of ruthlessly manipulating him to get at his money? When, late in the movie, the hero is moping about believing that his girlfriend just pretended she loved him to get what she wanted, it would perhaps have been more moving if he hadn't spent the past two hours encouraging her to do exactly the same thing to somebody else. I've no objection to movies in which all the characters are swine, but only if the movie appears to know that. The high moral point this movie has to make: You can behave as badly as you like if it 1) gets you what you want and 2) only hurts people you don't like. While that may very well be an accurate perception of modern morality, I refuse to accept it as romantic, much less heroic.Just a few of the problems with the script and its execution: A dated-50-years-ago "She has to sleep with the villain to save the show" arc is played out, in full, twice. There is no reason for the club owner to want to convert his club to a theater to help his hooker star become "a real actress" -- particularly since he knows she is dying. How does he plan to make his money back after she drops dead? Ewan McGregor never gets in the same area code as the correct pitch; he is off-key, at the top of his lungs, for two hours. Additionally, his accent wanders the British Isles, though his character is stated (for no particular reason, as it happens) to be English. The end of the "Like a Virgin" segment leaves the queasy (and we hope unintended) impression that the club owner is about to have sex with the villain -- while not resolving the plot point (ha!) that it is intended to resolve. There is an endless, dull-witted slapstick sequence during the initial approach to the wealthy victim that seems to have dropped in from some episode of "Animaniacs," or perhaps "Looney Tunes." Before that, Nicole Kidman is made to roll about orgasmically, for a really, really long time, to McGregor's insipid (and off-key, naturally) rendering of "Your Song." Baz Luhrmann must hate actors. The much-vaunted look of the production is just an ugly, vaguely Nouveau pastiche that looks derived from old Ken Russell movies. In fact, if this movie had to be made at all, Ken Russell would have done it better. I am not a fan of Ken Russell.A sleazy, hypocritical piece of trash, and a shameful waste of the time and talent of everyone involved except Luhrmann, who is, I suppose, doing about the best he can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It brought me back to French Can Can...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I did not read each and every comments that were made about this movie, I'm a bit distraught that nobody made the relation with the original plot of La Dame aux camélias (Alexandre Dumas Fils = La Boh?me).Also, it is evident that Luhrmann saw the 1959 French Can Can, a beautiful if naive movie about... Le Moulin Rouge. It was in this movie that I heard for the first time La Complainte de la butte, originally written for the film by Jean Renoir himself, and sung by Rufus Wainwright in Moulin Rouge (although you don't really hear it in the movie, it is on the soundtrack).I fell in love with that song when I was 10. It is one of the most beautiful love song I have ever heard. I use to sing it to my baby daughter to put her to sleep and now that she is five, she is singing it herself, and love it as well. I realize this is not much of a appreciation of the film (I must say I loved it but I would have loved it more if the Duke had been played by Alan Rickman)but I think it is worth mentioning that Luhrmann knows is subject well enough to pay an homage to the master and to one of my most cherished musical memory. For that, I thank him from the bottom of my heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing more exquisite than the costumes, scenery and music was the emotion put into this work of art. I thought that using modern songs was completely genious. An original score may have worked but I think that this aspect brought many more smiles and laughter than an original score ever could have. Plus, My favorite song from the movie is "Elephant Love Medely" which proves that not all actors are tone deaf. Everything in the movie was gorgeous. The use of color and light was amazing. The acting was wonderful. I was thrown so far into the movie that my eyes never left the screen until the end, and I was crying along with everyone else at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much have been said about the brilliance of this film, so i won't add to the obvious.I just want to say how impress i am with Ewan McGregor.I wasn't too much into his films. He was only so-so in Star Wars, and it was kind of ridiculous to hear rumours that he and Nicole Kidman was having some sort of off-camera relationship cos she happened to be married then to one of the most (supposedly) desirable man in Hollywood.But after sitting through the movie, i can't see why any woman won't fall in love, or at least feel something for Ewan, or the character he played.Its the way he really sings into the camera. It makes the audience feel as though he is singing to you, and only to you. Probably the men won't understand what i am blabbing about here, but its just incredible.I am not swoon, but he can sing much better than some of the boy-bands now. its a shame if he just restricts himself to acting, cos he has sooo much potential in the music area.he should at least do any musical.however, it must be said that he looks kind of young for Nicole. but that's quickly forgotten once either one of them start singing.also, i feel that Luz's direction of this movie is dissimilar to Romeo &amp; Juliet. the latter is darker and more gothic. Moulin Rouge is closer to Strictly Ballroom in terms of texture and personality. and obviously he has gotten himself acquintated with some clever computer effects engineers!a definite best for this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A yawn, I've seen this movie twice. The first time, I didn't like it. The second time I went to see if I could actually like it. Turns out I disliked it more the second time.People ask me if it's because it's not my kind of movie. I do prefer certain types of movies (american beauty, america psycho, fight club... that kind.)but I can watch any kind. I just tend to like drama/thriller.Moulin Rouge is a drama?! How? The only dramatic sequence I can remember is when the narcoleptic is singing Roxanne which is also the same scene when Satine is at dinner with the Duke. That's the only drama. That was one of my favorite scenes... Along when they're singing/explaining to the Duke what the play, Spectacular Spectacular is about... Cute, fun, bouncy scene.The plot was WEAK. Boy meets girl, the two fall in love... This is a problem, though, because the girl just happens to be unwillingly attached to someone else. How many times has this been done? With a slight different twist? It's BORING.There were NO likable characters besides Christian. Odd for me, because I tend to like the 'bad guys' and the 'villains'. Christian was the complete opposite. He was innocent. He was sweet. And McGregor can SING. I've never seen any of his movies besides this. He put on a great performance in this ho-hum movie. I will definitely be checking out some of his other work.All in all, this movie was below mediocre. 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think most of the negative comments miss the point. This is an Opera. All Operas have stupid plots (Figaro, Boheme, Magic Flute ....) The point of Opera is the communication of emotion by music (again think of the last part of Figaro). Charecterisation in Opera also comes from the music rather than the acting or spoken word; for example, the Countess Rosina in Figaro becomes real when she sings of her love for her husband - despite his infidelity.I treated this film as an opera and loved it (forget the plot listen to the emotion). I loved the way that well-known pieces of music were subverted and twisted - thank goodness somebody finally did something useful with the "Sound of Music". The real test of this film will be whether it remains as fresh in 10 years time. Sadly, I suspect not since I think that the music is probably not memorable enough.My only negative comment concerns Nicole Kidman -she fails to communicate emotion in her singing. However, I have been told that this is not a widely shared opinion. It's difficult to see who else could have played this part.</fullReview>

Casting misfired. The chemistry between Nicole and Ewan didn't feel real or deep.The best thing about the movie was the clever visuals of old Paris.This would be much better as a stage show but only if it was a parody of a love story, not the real thing.

My hats of to the director.

		<fullReview>It's interesting that this movie is so polarizing--you either hate it or love it. No middle ground. Kind of like politics and virtually everything else in this country today. I predict that this movie will gain its true due in the future--like many brilliant things, it's not appreciated in the moment. I'm just old enough to remember movie musicals in theatres, like Hello Dolly, etc. And this movie truly revisits that glorious era and then ups the ante. The glorious visuals are reason enough to see the film. Here's why I love it: In this cynical age, the director does not apologize for his straight-ahead romanticism, it's clear-eyed and as real as you can get in a visual cartoon like this. I applaud his bravery. It was refreshing to watch a movie without the self-aware, snickering, nudge-nudge so common of our era. Baz is a genius, but then I love Strictly Ballroom too--one of my favorite movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pleasant Surprise--possible spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I just got back from seeing Moulin Rouge. She had been looking forward to it for quite a while--I, on the other hand, was a bit more skeptical. It also did not help when I went on to this database and saw the 'memorable quotes' were 99% pop song lyrics--I knew it was a musical, but it set me up to expect trite, unoriginal, dialog. So, I was going in with a bit of trepidation, wanting to like the film (who goes to a movie not wanting to enjoy it?) but cautious.However, I was very pleasantly surprised. I left the theatre with the same feeling I had when I first saw 'Pulp Fiction'--not that they are at all similar in style, plot, themes, etc. (frankly, overall, 'Fiction' is a better film); but that both left me feeling as if I had witnessed something entirely new and exciting.The cinematography, set design, and direction set up the dream-world atmosphere that was necessary for such a production to work. The 'tried-but-true' plotline and the use of modern pop-song lyrics as dialog would have come off as pure cheeze without it. The past and present mingle in a movie that works purely on the emotional level--the way most good musicals strive to do. It doesn't matter that the Moulin Rouge of 1899 would not have played modern dance music--it's the *feeling* the club invoked in its patrons that's important. Playing the actual dance music of 1899 would not have invoked those same feelings in a modern audience.Within the first 10 minutes of the movie, you know that the affair will end tragically--but this knowledge takes nothing away from movie. It is the roller-coaster ride of the senses that drives this movie. The lovers do not end happily ever after, but having felt the love that they did, they do not regret having grasped it when they could ('the greatest thing you can ever learn, is to love and be loved in return')--and neither do you.It was also fun trying to 'name that tune' as song lyrics popped out of the dialog or were disguised in musical styles alien to the original recordings. The 'Tango of Roxanne' was beautiful, as was the sweet simplicity of 'Your Song'. It was also good to hear 'The Show Must Go On' as the semi-operatic opus it is--Freddie Mercury would have been proud. The 'Like a Virgin' number was hilarious--I couldn't stop laughing and thinking of the chase scene in Rocky Horror during 'Hot Patootie'!Overall, I was overwhelmed at the originality of the production and performances of the actors. This was not a movie to think about, it is a movie to experience--it is sensual, not intellectual. Moulin Rouge is not for everyone, but I was impressed in spite of myself and enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know how disappointed you are when they completely destroy a great book by making it into a mediocre movie? Well, I listened to the Soundtrack for a month before I had a chance to get to the movie, and I have to say I felt the same way. I had grown so attached to each full-length cut on the CD, I would have been happy with a string of music videos instead of a plot. However, this movie is much more than its music, it's a sensory experience. Much of the music is too deeply buried in that experience for me, but I still give it an 8. In fact, I'd pay double to be able to see it again - - in slow motion!!I also have to say that the movie's lush surroundings just bowled me over! With so much staging and constant activity, music within music, plots within plays within plots, it was okay for the main plot to be a bit unimpressive. The actors were a bunch of strong characters and Nicole Kidman's incredible accuracy of pitch was a happy surprise!! Who knew?? Throw in the humor, the surrealistic historical venue of Moulin Rouge, and the bows to dozens of musical hits from the past and it's a rollercoaster ride! No, more like a pinball table with me crying "Tilt". And then, I felt dizzy and kind of slapped in the face when it ended.This was one of the most unusual movies I have seen in years, and when I think back on it, all I can say is "Hurry Up, DVD". I wanna see it again.</fullReview>

An amazing film, who would have thought Nicole Kidman could look so amazing and play the role of a prostitute with such skill...she definately shined especially in the comedy scenes such as when she was attempting to hide her lover, Christian from the Duke...and that voice, she certainly can carry a tune very well....i would have to say she did a much better job of singing than Gwyneth Paltrow in Duets. The background of the film, created by special effects was very impressive as well. The dance moves and the directing were superb. However i feel that most the credits of this amazing film lies in its musical section, throwing in all types of music from all over, from "the hills are alive with the sound of music" to "diamonds and a girls best friend". The whole concept of where the origins of the songs though not at all logical or making sense... but then again... it's not suppose to be seen that way. Enjoy the film, as a musical, as we've not had such an amazing and spectacular musical in the cinemas for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie just by default, I was not very interested.But I am so glad I saw it, because it is so WEIRD. It's always nice for me to see something that is so different from the norm. To be honest, I don't know or care if it was a "good movie" or not - it gave me a very unusual couple of hours. Call me simple, but usually I go to the movies to entertain myself and get away, not to learn or think deep thoughts. So this film satisfied me.The plot was predictable and unoriginal, so if you live for plots you might not want to bother. If you expect movies to be "realistic" you'll be very disappointed, too. And as a love story it fell flat for me - I didn't care about either of the main characters. But somehow I still enjoyed it.Personally, I enjoyed a lot of the visual stuff - I'm not talking about "pretty" sets and costumes, more like strange ones. There are a lot of just plain creepy characters and images. A lot of the singing/dancing scenes were very interesting and vibrant, but admittedly some of the singing became too slow and sappy for me. Then, just when I was getting bored with the singing scenes, they hit me with the bizarre "Roxanne" scene which I loved. All in all, I would expect a lot of people to really hate it. I wouldn't recommend it to my parents. But I don't know YOUR parents...</fullReview>

All I can say was that I enjoyed the movie tremendously and wish to see it again. Baz took great leap of faith with making a movie that was placed in an extinct style and he should be applauded for that regardless of whether or not you enjoyed the movie. I would say that at times, I was so blown away by the power of the direction/music/acting that I could not breathe, let alone move out of my chair at the end of the movie. I must warn people however that the quick, flashy direction may give some people a headache and ruin the experience for them or they may find the story dull/boring and the acting lifeless, but it just depends on who you are and what you are into. I would ask though, that please when you watch this movie, do so with an open mind and open heart so that you can enjoy this dazzling cinematic experience for all that it is worth. Moulin Rouge is a different, dazzling, hilarious, tragic, colourful, wistful, tounge-in-cheek joyride through the world of underground Paris, that seems like it doesn't want to take itself too seriously and is there for the sole purpose of entertainment. Don't think, just watch, and remember to breathe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maudlin Rouge -- "More is less. Much, much less."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the art world, they use the expression `less is more', and MOULIN ROUGE is the best example of `more is less -- much, much less.' They went to the trouble and expense of creating lushly detailed sets and costumes, then edited the damn thing so fast you can't take in a bit of it. Meanwhile this jumble hangs on a tedious farce about hiding a romance from a rich suitor who not only invests in their musical but owns the soul of every person in the joint. It would have been more interesting (and believable) if the Duke had not been so Snidely-Whiplash-totally-dastardly (Muwahahahahhh, *cue: twirl moustache*), and if the courtesan had been torn between two attractive suitors. It was very uncharacteristic for such a hardened woman to so easily lose her heart.Now frenetic wackiness and cartoonish camp could be forgivable as light entertainment, but this flick also demands us to care about its characters when they weren't even passable soap opera material. "A love that will last forever" -- right. These cardboard cut-outs can sing about love all they want, but when they scream in my face to care about their tragic lives, I shout back, `maudlin!' And when the end credit states this film is about Beauty, Truth, and above all Love ? well, my wretching precludes shouting out anything at all. All this was bitterly disappointing, because the movie had opened hopefully with a full-screen proscenium and curtain and a small (life-size) conductor below, gesticulating while the 20th Century Fox anthem blared away like an overture... then it successfully transitioned into the past, and the first few impressive show-stoppers hinted that the historical Moulin Rouge was about to be transformed into a metaphor for our modern entertainments (hence a reason for our contemporary music transported back a hundred years). But instead of a witty statement about ourselves, we're given a B-grade melodrama. Hmmm, maybe unwittingly the film HAS made a statement about the 3-ring circus known as modern media.There's also Revisionism gone wild: Toulouse Lautrec, genius of painting, is thoughtlessly converted into a lisping playwright/clown reminiscent of The Boob from `Yellow Submarine'. (Aww, isn't he cute.) Dammit, he wasn't a dwarfish court jester, but a real person with passions and pleasures and fears and fancies like the rest of us. Oh yeh, this is also yet-another flick where everyone in Paris talks with a British accent.Music: 8/10 (Good voices from Kidman &amp; McGregor; only devalued by a penchant to continuously repeat the wretched `Your Song.')...... Set design and effects: 10/10...... Mind-numbing editing that destroyed the set design and effects: 2/10...... Story: 1/10 (Luhrmann is no Puccini.)..... Overall: 3/10 -- a beautiful-looking disaster that severely p***ed me off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably not the musical you are thinking of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The word "musical" usually makes me think of those films from vintage cinema or those Disney animated films. Moulin Rouge is not like this. The movie's tone is a bit more serious and contains suggestive dialogue (as it should be considering the setting). The musical numbers are a mix of both modern-style original and adapted songs such as Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You" and Madonna's "Like a Virgin." But, make no mistake -- neither the songs nor the score contain heavy rock-n-roll or electrics; think more along the lines of a full orchestra.I thought the music worked well for this movie and offered a different style of storytelling than the norm. It had a pretty interesting musical-within-a-musical plot. The movie itself did seem visually hard-hitting and disjointed at times, especially in the beginning, but it does settle down once the love story gets going, and an emotional one it is.Don't dismiss Moulin Rouge because of your predispositions, because chances are they don't apply in this case. It's not your typical musical. Also, it's not so much like Luhrmann's "Romeo + Juliet" -- you can like one and not the other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revels in its ridiculousness, and that's not a bad thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann knows he's going to look foolish. So does Nicole Kidman. So does Ewan MacGregor. By the end of the first half hour of this film the entire cast and crew has tried very hard to bring themselves to meet your very definition of the most utter foolishness you can imagine. Then they go past it. So, the question is, are you going to take this film for what it is -- an absurdist satire on cynicism, if you can believe that -- or just think it nothing more than ridiculous? I decided to go with it and had two-thirds of a great time. You know exactly where the plot's going, you know how it's going to end, you know with all the silly archetypes you've been introduced to that it's going to have nothing but either flamboyant or sincere melodrama at the outcast. I laughed hysterically at this film, but I think it knew I was laughing at it. In fact the movie almost dares you to ridicule it, then tops your ridicule with a cherry and does the next most ridiculous thing you can imagine. I admire its audacity. It was laughing back at me. I can handle that. Really the only big drag about the film was the length of the ending and how it probably took itself a little more seriously than it had to at that part, but hell, you knew going in that it was melodramatic, didn't you? Frankly, I admire its nerve. That counts a lot for me. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a trippy experience. I hated the first 15-20 minutes SO much it was all I could do to stay in my seat. I went to complain to the manager that the movie was out of focus but he said the first reel was suppose to be and he had a letter from the film company to prove it. For me, it was too surreal and gave me a headache. But after that ridiculous scene where the actors offer a preview of "Spectacular Spectacular" for the Duke, it got so much better! What surprised me the most was Ewan and Nicole's voices...I had heard they weren't very good but they blew me out of my seat. They gave 100% which is so risky in a project like this. They both had so much confidence and sincerity on screen and without it, this movie would have descended into complete camp. They sang their hearts out. I liked Ewan from Trainspotting but he completely won my heart in this picture...he was so earnestly in love you could almost feel his joy and pain. And Nicole! I knew she could be a sexpot when she wants to but she almost pulls a Marilyn Monroe in this...sexy &amp; talented but with an added gift of intelligence and street smarts.All I can say is that this is one film where part of the audience walks out and another part is sobbing at the end! Truly unique. And was that elephant apartment cool or what?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an absolute delight for music lovers and those who like their cinema more than a little adventurous. From The Sound of Music to Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, from Nirvana to Elton John, Baz Luhrmann doffs his cap to popular icons and delivers one himself.Kidman CAN act. The two main roles are so left of centre they almost fall off the screen. And Macgregor? From Jedi Knight to belting out show tunes, this man has versatility in spades.From the swooping opening shots through a bleak collage like France to the iridescent colour of the stage sets, this is a delight to the eye and the set pieces are something to behold.This film left images in my mind that will take a long time to shake. I have no comprehension how Luhrmann could have an idea like this and then somehow transfer the idea to film. There are some influences evident to even my untrained eye, the use of colour seems like George Millers `Pig In The City', bold and deep; some of the dance scenes had my mind back at `Strictly Ballroom.' But despite this, Moulin Rouge is truly original and deserves to be seen by the throngs in the U.S. and should be an unmitigated success.Congratulations to Fox for taking what must have been a sizeable risk, and more power to Australian moviemakers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film I've seen all year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>En route to the opening night of Moulin Rouge, I got depressed over the (lack of) quality of the film's I had seen thus far in 2001. But after the two-hour showing of Baz Luhrmann's remake of the musical, I had new hope for the future of cinema. It was hands-down the best picture I had seen in years.I know not everyone will agree with my assessment. If you didn't like Luhrmann's last flick, William Shakespeare's Rome + Juliet, you won't care for this one either. The plot it highly predictable, especially since it's presented in flashback form and the ending is revealed in the opening scene. But that's what makes it enjoyable, as you can just sit back and enjoy the technicolor fantasy. And Luhrmann doesn't hold anything back there, using both black and white and "brown-toned" film stock to contrast his brilliant colors, particularly of the color red. If the costuming and color scheme aren't enough to bedazzle you, however, the music will. Kidman has a surprisingly good voice, and McGregor's is amazing. But it's the songs themselves that will really get to you. A short list of the songs includes Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit," The Police's "Roxanne," Elton John's "Your Song," and a rousing rendition of Madonna's "Like a Virgin"--sung by the Moulin Rouge's impressario, Jim Broadbent, no less. In one scene McGregor and Kidman cite the lyrics to a dozen love songs.This movie is the product of an MTV culture, and those from the older generations won't be the ones flocking to the theaters. If you liked the style of Romeo + Juliet or the wittiness of Shakespeare in Love and you're up for a different kind of film, this one's for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reviews that I have read about this film all differ from "OH MY GOD" to "THAT WAS AN ENORMOUS WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY". All I can say was that I enjoyed the movie tremendously and wish to see it again. Baz took great leap of faith with making a movie that was placed in an extinct style and he should be applauded for that regardless of whether or not you enjoyed the movie. I would say that at times, I was so blown away by the power of the direction/music/acting that I could not breathe, let alone move out of my chair at the end of the movie. I must warn people however that the quick, flashy direction may give some people a headache and ruin the experience for them or they may find the story dull/boring and the acting lifeless, but it just depends on who you are and what you are into. I would ask though, that please when you watch this movie, do so with an open mind and open heart so that you can enjoy this dazzling cinematic experience for all that it is worth. Moulin Rouge is a different, dazzling, hilarious, tragic, colourful, wistful, tounge-in-cheek joyride through the world of underground Paris, that seems like it doesn't want to take itself too seriously and is there for the sole purpose of entertainment. Don't think, just watch, and remember to breathe.</fullReview>

It was terrible -- I could only spend 20 minutes in the theatre -- I had a terrible headache from the noise, the "music" that was partially interspersed everywhere without rhyme or reason, from the garish photography and costumes, and the whole ball of wax!! Friends, believe me, I had a migraine!! I told the cinema people and they were very kind and gave me a pass for a future film. I went home, took two Excedrin for migraines and slept for about 4 hours!! This is a horrible picture -- I am 59 years old -- I guess too old for this sort of stuff -- must be for the MTV generation. Oh well, I do feel very sorry for them -- I hope their hearts, souls, psyches, tastes, abilities, imaginations, aspirations, intelligence, and humanity are not what this film screams at the viewer!! Chaos, pure chaos. I know poor Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise just had a marriage break-up, I am sorry to hear that -- however, perhaps it happened because Nicole requested that Tom watch this film in its entirety!!! Good and just cause for a divorce!! Enough said!! See you later. Only one good thing is that little fellow Ewan -- I remember him in an ER segment -- he was good in that one. I also tried to see "Eye of the Beholder" with him and walked out also!! I hope this young man does not keep his quirky characters for the rest of his career!! Oh well -- so it goes. by all for now!!</fullReview>

"This is history being made!"I am amazed I even heard the comment due to the 16 year old girls who were laughing histerically because they had been crying so hard. The old guy in front of me got up and proclaimed its the best thing he's seen all year and the asian couple to my right didn't wanna leave the theatre until they had seen all the credits. Even then they were still clutching hands and wiping away tears. What a demographic! Its amazing to see such a diverse audience respond so uniformly. I loved the movie myself. I thought it took the audience on an incredible ride from begining to end. Its a movie that breaks rules and invents new paths for future films. Hopefully the Moulin Rouge will start a new trend in the movie musical. I feel its about time!!! I believe this movie will do very well in the box office and at the Oscars. At least taking home nominations for Best Picture, Best leading actress/actor, Best Original Song, Best Direction, Cinematography, Make UP, Costumes-----the list goes on. Its an incredible film. If you haven't seen it you MUST. Even if you don't like it, at least you'll have an opinion when everyone is talking about it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story and music could have stood on their own.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept behind 'Moulin Rouge' has so much potential and could have been a classic, if director Baz Luhrmann had trusted his audience just a bit more. The leading actors (Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor), the use of music both familiar and original, the costumes, the color, the concept, and (above all) the love story were enough to make this a great movie. However, especially in the first half, the substance was secondary to the style. The fast cuts, sound effects, sped-up sequences, and slapstick often detracted from the strength of the story and the power of the music. For example, near the beginning there is a scene in the Moulin Rouge where the can-can dancers do a number to a minute or so of disco hit 'Lady Marmalade.' The spectacle, the costumes, the color and the anachronism would have had tremendous power if this sequence was filmed in one or two shots. Instead, it was as series of jump cuts with lots of screaming and shouting obscuring the music. There were many similar scenes. This movie had everything it needed to be great: a hero you root for, a tragic heroine, a villain you love to hate, wonderful music, and an original look. If only Luhrmann had resisted the temptation to pile on his signature effects, it could have achieved that greatness. That said, Kidman and McGregor were brilliant and sang all their own songs, and the concept and use of music were fascinating. It's worth seeing on the big screen for the spectacle of it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Music Be the Food of Love...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...Baz Lurhmann is surely a master chef. I have seen three of his films now, he has proven over and over that he knows the power of music in a film. "Moulin Rouge" is a prime example of this, being a musical by genre. And it is a film with so much potential it nearly hurts to see it thrown aside for editing and manic insanity.The sets/costumes were wonderful. The music was amazing. There was so much potential in the cast...but there was too much "wackiness" and too little raw emotional power.The film begins too quickly. I loved the flashback structure, but once the story, itself, began, it moved far too quickly. I have no quarrel with "love at first sight," but here it seemed a bit out of place, especially with someone in Satine's profession. If Lurhmann had lengthened the time between Satine and Christian's first meeting and the development of their love, I think I might have found it more believable. Also, I thought Satine seemed a bit overly nervous and...well...manic. Her character is reminiscent of Violetta Valery, but Violetta seemed more poised even outside the public eye.The musical numbers were wonderful. "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend" was fantastic. Peter Travers claimed Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor's voices were "barely serviceable," but I beg to differ. McGregor has a gorgeous warm tenor well-suited to any romantic lead in a musical theatre production and, while Kidman pales in comparison, she sounds pretty damn good for an untrained singer. Plus, it also must be taken into account that her character was not *supposed* to sound like La Divina. She was a courtesan by trade, who just happened to have a half-decent voice.The Moulin, itself, was a fantasyland. Sets and costumes throughout this film were phenomenal - I felt as though I had been literally catapulted into an absinthe-dream of 1900 rather than 1900, itself. Which, I believe, was Lurhmann's intention, and it worked wonderfully.The middle portions of the film were easily the best. The "Elephant Love Medley" was just plain cute, sweet, and funny, and Kidman's rendition of "One Day I'll Fly Away" was exquisitely poignant, especially with the glittering lights of the Moulin in the background. The camera seemed to zip through their affair, however, and that took away from the emotional effect.Out of the entire film, there were two scenes that were carved into my mind as brilliant. One was the "Tango de Roxanne" - absolutely positively riveting. Gorgeous editing job, intercutting between the incredibly sexy tango and the scene with the Duke and Satine. The entire sequence, ending with Satine's attempted departure from the Moulin immediately elevated the film from the "rather good" status it had prior to those scenes.The other was the entire production of "Spectacular Spectacular" - aptly named. I was stunned by the sheer visual beauty of the show, and the scene with Satine and Christian (that Lurhmann obviously pulled almost verbatim from "La Traviata") had me literally in tears. *That* was the chemistry between Kidman and McGregor. *That* was what this film should and could have been!! "Come What May" was equally gorgeous, and Lurhmann could have easily just ended the film there.S P O I L E RSatine's death scene was overdone. It would have been so much more effective if she had died offscreen, rather than resorting to the rather cliched "I will always be with you" that seems to haunt every death scene of every film.In all, "Moulin Rouge" was a film with the potential to be a masterpiece. I will be seeing it again, definitely, for those scenes I loved, but it was not the film I anticipated for five months. Perhaps I expected too much from the photographs and the music. Perhaps I expected the original version before it fell through the shredding machine known as editing.I daresay I will wait until it comes out on DVD and maybe those scenes I wanted will appear in the "Deleted Scenes" section.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautifully executed visual feast.Let me just say that this movie has no original pieces in the whole movie. However, the originality of the movie comes through in its unique and post-modern arrangement of the other people's creations without becoming overly cliché.The basic plot of the story is simple; boy meets a girl, boy falls in love with the girl, some conflict, and resolution.However, with its master cinematography and customs, this movie shines.I had two problems with the movie. The first 10 min of the movie is just too confusing and annoying. It can be seen as a techno. aspect of the movie, But I didn't like it.Secondly, to overcome awkwardness of musical, they used a lot of popular in-pop music. While this added to the humor and will appeal to teen-agers, little less pop-music and more original arrangement could have made this movie solid 10 for me.Overall, a great meal that satisfies your mind as well as your taste buds.</fullReview>

I love it. Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for music but this movie is combining both decent acting and a great variety of songs. If you like musicals then go and see this. It's one of the best movies out there for the moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's up with Baz Luhrmann? Each new film gets faster and faster. The opening 40 minutes not only had my head spinning, but several times during the remainder of the film I had to stop up my ears, the pain was so great! Please Baz, give us something we can see, not something flashing by so fast that we have to guess at what we saw. And some originality too. Ripping off your Act 1 set from your 1990 production of "La boheme" (Christian's rooftop apartment) doesn't pass as a tribute, tip-of-the-hat, or homage with me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daring, sometimes brilliant -- but often laughable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In five years, people will be lining up to see the midnight showing of this movie at The Waverly Theatre in Greenwich Village. People will dress as their favorite characters, shout out lines at the screen and sing along.Where this movie succeeds -- it is brilliant. But the plot is as predictable as they come, the quality of the singing is merely adequate, and the scenes that fail are laughable -- and not always on purpose.This is a daring movie -- but one that, ultimately, fails. It is worth seeing only to encourage the writers, directors and actors to keep taking risks. And -- yes -- it is worth seeing for those few scenes that soar (like the narcoleptic Argentine who sings ROXANNE as a tango).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Review of The Spectacular Spectacular Film for the Ages!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was more imaginative and vividly inventive than any I have ever seen. It is a feast for the eyes albeit a hyper-active one. Each scene is memorable and lavishly spectacular. The songs are easily recognizable and yet they are, in some cases, modified beyond belief. The acting and singing is magnificent, Nicole and Ewan can belt out tunes with the best of them. But most of all this film is romantic... it will appeal to lovers of TITANIC and those that loved the innocent romanticism of the Golden Age of musicals. Nicole is at her very best in a daring and powerful role... she is becoming a GREAT actress! Baz Luhrman follows up on his flamboyant reputation with a film that surpasses all his previous outings. This is the best film of the past two years and I LOVE IT for being over the top and romantic and beautiful and silly and charming and truthful. Oscar time is a long way off but this film WILL be remembered for sure.Congratulations Nicole, Ewan, and Baz on a film that will be a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absinthe or crack?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the preparations for this movie, Baz Luhrmann allegedly had everyone over to his grand ol' house and they all had a lot of absinthe and sang and got silly. It was a character-building exercise.Almost every single criticism of this film I've read was valid. It is too much. Every single musical number (and the movie is jam-packed with them) is really, really too long. I love old movie musicals, but doggone it, if you're going to have a 12-minute musical sequence, there'd better be some incredible dancing in the middle of it. If there was incredible dancing in this movie, I didn't notice - I was far too dazzled by the gorgeous, overblown costumes and mind-altering camerawork. It's a melting merry-go-round of ribbons and gilt and glittering jewels, like a superb fever dream in an antique canopy bed hung with velvet drapes...But....Nicole Kidman is radiant, of course; she's never looked better (or thinner, which is not really so much to her advantage). She cries so many real tears that half of her screen time is spent with her makeup in a gummy mess on her cheeks. One still wants to kiss it better. Ewan McGregor is full of that puppyish charm that endeared him to me in the first place. I do prefer him as a redhead rather than the oily jet dyejob he sports here, but it works nonetheless. John Leguziamo is, frankly, wasted; Toulouse-Lautrec was an insanely cool guy, and this should have been a great showcase for Leguziamo's amazing brand of physical comedy. Alas, he mainly lisps and swills absinthe and he doesn't even paint anything. Erh? Richard Roxburgh plays the stock baddie in a most stock-baddie way; for the first hour or so, I could have sworn he was Christopher Guest. Oh well, he doesn't have much to work with; I don't think he agonized over his "motivation" when it's so incredibly obvious.But...The musical aspect is probably the hardest thing about this movie. While the conceit is very clever - contemporary songs, lots and lots of them, de-contextualized and all swooshed up together in a big pop-culture smoothie - it actually starts to grate after a while.All the same, when I thought I was pretty well sick of the picture, something else really thrilling and funny would happen and I'd be shaking my head and swept back into it again.On first viewing, I can't say definitively whether or not I actually think the movie is good (I certainly enjoyed it); however, I think the film absolutely demands at least one additional viewing, just to be able to catch all the stuff I only saw out the corner of my eye. I wish Baz Lurhmann had actually just gone ahead and made a stage show out of this instead of making it into a movie, but here's the movie, and it's really out of this world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploiting the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is one of the best cinematic experiences I have seen in years. Baz Luhrman takes his directorial style to new heights with this soaring story of love. At the heart of the movie is the simplest idea. All you need is love. Now...for the cynical moviegoer...this won't be enough to sustain your interest for two hours. But for the moviegoer who loves to believe in love, this movie delivers. Set admist the very un-romantic setting of a french brothel in 1900 is a story of true romance. AND IT'S A MUSICAL!!! Firt...a note on musicals...the theory behind musicals isn't to be cheesy as many moviegoers feel. It is said that characters in musicals sing and dance because they have to. They've expressed all of their emotions in speech and need a new platform to convey their feelings. So they sing...they sing for life...for love...and for the world. Granted...it gives the performer a chance to show off his abilities...to wow the audience with a number or two. But it is meant to express the charcters inner feelings.That's what Moulin Rouge does. Going with the convention of using modern day lyrics in 1900 France...the musical numbers explode from the screen. Baz is a master of eye candy...but beneath his candy is feeling...passion and romance. Maybe the lead vocals were doctored. To quote history...Audrey Hepburn did not do all of her own singing in MY FAIR LADY and that is considered a masterpiece. Entire characters vocal tracks were dubbed in THE KING and I and even recently in EVERYBODY SAYS I LOVE YOU a nice musical as well) Drew Barrymore was obviously overdubbed. Those stars of movie musicals inthe past weren't the greatest singers either...but they emoted...just like Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor. This is coming from a person who is not an avid musical fan. I hate the cheesy MY FAIR LADY's and GIGI's and anything with Rodger or Hammerstein in the title. I like the musicals that speak to the audience in a real way. Like Cabaret...or Chorus Line. Moulin Rouge spoke to me. It created a world where love is possible...and not only possible...but wonderful. Where love can make you sing. Visually the movie is like nothing before. Baz exploits all the best of cinema. With his quick takes, and moving camera, and extreme close-ups you see all the little sublties in a not so subtle movie.To pause on that...the movie isn't subtle. That isn't its intention...the musical from 1960 and before isn't subtle. Its not supposed to be. TO use current lyrics is brilliant by Baz. It allows the viewers to be connected and still experience a musical. Something which is foreign to modern movie-goers. Baz is trying to recreate the musical...which is needed. There is talk of RENT and CHICAGO being movies. I hope they are. So few people view the theatre anymore...and what better way to expose them to it but to bring it to the movies. Back to the movie...to truly experience the movie you have to let yourself go...accept the blatantness of the movie and allow all of its conventions to surround. It is more than a two hour music video...it is a simple story of love...where every emotion is so great...the characters must sing. The characters will carry you away. Ewan is moving as the lost poet with love in his heart...and Kidman is appropriately fetching and sensistive. They float this movie up into the moonlit scenes that much of it takes place in. I'm hoping the academy doesn't look over Jim Broadbent who steals everyscene he is in...like the Emcee of Cabaret Broadbent embodies the feeling of the Moulin Rouge. He is the abandoment of the club...but more than that he is its heart. John Leguizamo...who may become a Baz staple...is very scene stealing and very effective. In sum...the cast shines...the movie shines...and you will want to talk about it after it is over. See the movie which EXPLOITS (in a good way) all that cinema has to offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unless you are craving to hear people screaming at each other or to sit through unimaginative choreography for two hours, avoid this disjointed cinematic contraption involving one of the least photogenic support cast I ever recall seeing on screen. Not only are they not a pleasant sight, but the director insists on constantly filling the screen with their grimacing faces. How much teeth, gums, tongue and bulging eyeballs can one stand ? The storyline is insipid, the acting mechanical, the editing choppy and distracting.One thing is certain in my mind: if Moulin Rouge had offered the kind of noisy and uninspired music heard on this film, the chances are very slim that it would have been the setting for a film a century later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On a better note, I went to a screening of Moulin Rouge last Tuesday evening. For the non-epileptic among you, I heartily recommend this one! It starts in a nearly cartoon fashion, then it segues into a bizarre fusion of traditional musical theatre and music video, an acid trip through Name That Tune. The cinematic stagings include some over-the-top pieces such as an all male rendition of Madonna's paean, Like a Virgin. This is a fantasy as ever as Andrew Lloyd Webber saw drama, and if you can be mesmerized by a Technicolor Dreamcoat, Baz Luhrmann's rather joyous answer to Aronofsky's not-so Requiem for a Dream will sweep you to a place you probably have never been: into an applauding hoi polloi of post-modern distinction. After the mind-numbing disaster that is Pearl Harbor, this film salvages the summer for me.</fullReview>

Don't get me wrong, both have terrific stories, but did we really need them to be re-hashed, with new songs? I think not.

		<shortDescription>A circus blend of Shakespearean comedy, Cabaret, and Romeo &amp; Juliet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has plenty of pizzazz, dash and spectacle with fabulous costumes, eccentric characters, dizzying camera movement, and a curiously surreal, circus-like Paris. It's also a funny, fresh look at the tragic love story -- and only with Baz Luhrmann at the helm could that not be a contradiction.This is a musical, first of all, and that will alienate some potential movie-goers. The characters burst into extravagant musical numbers (my favorites were the Roxanne tango--WOW--and the comic "Like a Virgin" number) at the drop of a hat, and any smidgen of realism is non-existent. That said, however, the love story between Christian (Ewan McGregor) and Satine (Nicole Kidman) carries a surprising ring of truth. McGregor's natty smile (reminds me a little of Hugh Grant, but I reckon McGregor brings it off in a less corny way) and Kidman's melting response just work a treat.Story-wise, this one is very Shakespearean with all sorts of mix-ups and confusions and plenty of bizarre side-characters with wonderful cameo roles. You feel like the cast had a lot of fun making this film, and you're let in on some of the jokes, which is very neat.That all said, I still wasn't as pulled into this film as I have been with others. It was fun and I wasn't bored, but I wasn't much moved either, and at the end I have to give this film a firm thumb up, but not two thumbs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is a rather unfulfiling experience. I had heard and experienced the hype as well as the numberous bad reviews. I must say, this dazzling, fickle piece is not worth it. I am rather a fan of Baz Luhrmann so I was REALLY disappointed with this one. (I was in the cinema three days after it opened in a peak hour session with less than a dozen people seeing it.)First of all, it felt like Luhrmann was a kid let loose in a candy store and just wanted everything. He just lost sight of the FILM aspect when he was thrown all that industry money. There were WAY too many elements thrown in for the sake of throwing in elements. Oh wow, isn't Baz intelligent, he's got all these different things in his film! The result is a hybrid, bombastic musical with the cinema sounding more like a rock concert than a nice musical about courtesans.The visual merry go round is nausiating after a while. The whole morphing effect was overdone with a great sense of vertigo. A little bit for effect is fine but you can't do your whole movie in this way!Considering they spent about $100 million on this one, they could have made realistic sets as opposed to deliberately artificial, commical ones.Nothing in this movie is really original except for the writing/transformation of old songs into new ones. That I do commend the writers. The storyline is taken from an opera (I don't want to be a spoilsport so I won't tell you which opera) and the songs as I said, are all old stuff. I was thoroughly embarrassed for Nicole Kidman, especially in its rather boring begining.Ewan MacGregor is excellent and has a really nice voice. I wouldn't be surprised if he releases an album next year!</fullReview>

This movie was awesome and I have no idea what the nay-sayers are complaining about...Man where to start...throw all preconceptions about the film out the window when you sit down. Everything you've heard about Moulin Rouge is true (most of it at least!), it's colorful, bold, bright and explosive. The acting is awesome and while I'm no expert on the art, I think Kidman and McGregor pulled it off superbly and their singing was fantastic...who'd have thunk that they could sing as well?! Kudos to the other actors as well, particularly Leguizamo and the guy who played the Duke. The musical scenes are mind-blowing (particularly the finale) and the choreography and the dancers and..everything! Awesome! The soundtrack was great as well, which is why I went out and bought the CD today...I really urge you to see this movie. When I walked out of the theater last night, my mind was pretty much spinning and not much had sunk in. It's the sort of movie that really hits you when you wake up the next morning. Don't listen to the people who seem to think any nail that sticks out and doesn't conform with movie-making convention has to be hammered down. Moulin Rouge is indeed different. It's amazingly different and bound to leave you with a big "Wow" plastered on your mouth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being strictly a romantic comedy fan, Moulin Rouge is not a movie I would normally have gone to see, and I was slightly skeptical at first.The first 20 minutes to half an hour can only be described in my opinion as STRANGE. Confusing, to say the least, although the tequila hallucination with Kylie Minogue as the Green Fairy was really cute. After the beginning of the movie, the love between Satine (Kidman) and Christian (McGregor) unfolds and it sweeps you along in spellbound musical emotion.The costumes are fantastic (I loved the scenes at the end where the actual play Spectacular, Spectacular was being performed), the dancing is great, the pitch to squeeze financing out of the Duke in the elephant room was hilarious, and the music was fantastic. Before seeing the film, I had no idea how they could incorporate modern music into a period piece musical, but somehow it actually worked. They used everything from Madonna (with an entire 'Like A Virgin' scene) to Elton John to Nirvana to 'The hills are alive with the sound of music'. I couldn't wait to see what I recognised next.Having said this, there was also some original music in the film, and the lyrics were just amazing. I didn't even get sick of hearing the two main phrases (people that have seen the movie will know which ones) and the acts that caught me the most were the rooftop scene with Kidman and McGregor singing, and the final play scene with them singing their 'secret song'.Overall, this is a movie you'll fall in love with. Go with an open mind, sit patiently through the beginning and give it a go. It's a movie you just can't stop thinking about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge works. Despite some flaws in pacing that may improve withfurther viewing, Lurhman has succeeded in modernising and rewriting themusical format. It is a movie that tries to be everything to everyonebut its enjoyably open and its poignancy and sweetness are backed upwith a knowing, sardonic humour release. Ewan and Nicole excel as thelovers and the flirtation with screwball comedy as they seduce oneanother is a giddy, gay old time. The music is a revelation, as popsongs become standards to be treated with a certain reverence rarelyseen until now. Roxburgh's villain is comparable with Billy Zane's"Titanic" villain in a performance either exaggerated and irritating ordeliciously over the top- still hard to decide. Its a film about loveindeed, a love of cinema too and innovation while renewing a classicgenre. I loved it and feel it will grow with me. A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is the most wonderful movie I have seen in a very long time. I can't believe it received some bad reviews, because I don't have a single bad word to say about it. The raw passion of this movie makes you feel the emotions of the characters as though you were there with them. The dancing and singing are fantastic. As far as I'm concerned, the story in Moulin Rouge is the best love story in the world, and beats out even Romeo and Juliet. This movie has everything, even humour, which I wasn't expecting. I completely loved it and recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a story about love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Music and production design, as in all Baz Luhrmann's films, are the primary attraction here. This film looks and sounds utterly spectacular. But this very spectacle works against the film's declared theme.Luhrmann and co-writer Pearce evidently think that having their hero walk around repeatedly proclaiming that "this is a story about love" somehow makes it so. It doesn't. It may well be the case that "the greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love, and to be loved in return", but rather than being told so ad nauseum, I'd much rather be told a story which demonstrates it. On that count, the Christian/Satine love story fails miserably. It is escalated so rapidly and explored so superficially (the use of pop lyrics not helping) that it's hardly even moving, let alone a compelling argument for love as the meaning of life. Every moment of potential connection between character and audience is thrust aside for another visual or aural display. Luhrmann and Pearce could get away with this as an approach to "Romeo + Juliet" because their source text was one of the greatest love stories ever told. All they had to do was cut it without messing it up, which they barely managed. But not here. With "Moulin Rouge" the storytelling is left up to them, and they clearly aren't up to it. This is not a story about love. It's not really a story about anything. One is left with the suspicion that what we have here is either a lecture on the history of romantic musicals, or a two-hour commercial for a CD.Still, it's entertaining enough. Nicole and Ewan are both amazing, and seeing Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh - the greatest Shakespearean actor I've had the pleasure of seeing - perform "Like A Virgin" is worth the price of admission alone. For me, Roxburgh entirely steals the show. We can now forgive him for "M:I-2".</fullReview>

Fast editing, and a thumping soundtrack, keep you glued to the opening 10 minutes, getting you intrigued into this strange world that is before you. The plot is simple and easy to follow, good fun, and very touching.In all if you liked Shakespeare in Love and Romeo and Juliet, you will love this. If you like classic modern songs, you will love this (see the old men singing Smells Like Teen Spirit).Great fun, go and see it, take a girl, she will love it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Post-modern cinematic orgasm.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(May technically contain spoilers) I should preface this review with saying I had a really bad feeling that this film was really going to suck. I had hoped it would live up to the hype, but as so often happens with Hollywood hype, films fall flat on their own false reputation. Baz Luhrmann's film "Moulin Rouge" far exceeded any expectations I had, negative or positive, and was a truly magical and beautiful cinematic experience. While most filmmakers agree that at a fundamental level, films should be in some way about the human condition, there is always a drive to create, innovate and impress. All too often films try too hard to do one or the other to extremes, but once in a while a film comes along and does them both, splendidly. "Moulin Rouge" is one such film. The story in "Moulin Rouge" takes the tried and true narrative path of the innocent love story, between the coveted and gorgeous courtesan, 'Satine' (Nicole Kidman) and young naive writer 'Christian' (Ewan Macgregor). The plot centers on these two characters' struggle to practice their love, which is forbidden for a variety of reasons. The most pressing obstacle to their love is the 'evil' (read: classic slimey Hollywood bad guy character) Duke of Monroth, played hilariously by the talented Richard Roxburgh. Without giving too much of the story away, the Duke's character puts the young lovers in a decidedly tough position and ultimately puts their love to the test. Cinematically, "Moulin Rouge" is a feast for the eyes, as well as the ears. Yes it can be campy. Yes it can be over the top. Is that a problem? If you are a cynic who can't handle too much colour (and I have to tell you I thought I was) or honestly believe in nothing but stark realism in cinema, then this film is probably not for you. To those of you with an open mind, this film is a gorgeous rainbow for the eyes and ears.The soundtrack. Where to begin? A postmodern extravaganza of lovesong lyrics well weaved into traditional orchestral songs, as well as ultra modern thumping electronica... Luhrman (who was the album producer) has done to the musical what hiphop did to the humble sampler. (Who said you can only sample recorded audio? Why not lyrics and score as well?).. Again I don't want to give anything away, but think of all the many cheesy love songs of the last twenty years compressed into a couple of all-encompassing big band musical scores in the most tastefully kitsch and gorgeously wonderful way. This film oozes post modern cred. :) As for the performances themselves - it was great to see that non-musicians were chosen to lead, as well as sing. They (Kidman, Macgregor) have good voices, but they don't have the heavily over-trained voices of a singer. In my humble opinion this makes the soundtrack so much more honest, which is so important for a love story like this. They don't sound like pop stars, they sound like your friend or neighbour who has a nice voice (maybe they even sound like you)... Technically. Well all I can say is as an Australian in the film industry I often wondered why it took Hollywood so long to work out we always had the skills (I guess now we have the currency that will soon come in bundles ;P ), but anyway the special effects and studio wizardry in this film is what the world has come to expect from films out of Fox in Sydney, so no surprises there. And the only minor quibble I had? The music was wonderful. BUT (and I strongly believe it was just the theater I was in - a preview screening with most patrons just thankful to be there), the mixes on the songs, while on the whole very good, at the worst of times did not really seem (technically, mixing) designed for a cinema space. For the most part they were rich and sonically dynamic, but on one or two tracks I felt the audience was a bit dissapointed at how the location audio was pushed right forward at the expense of bassy thumpin' tracks. Nonetheless, the quality was excellent, despite the concerned head scratching of one or two patrons in the theater I was in. Cinema audiences these days, I ask you. ;) It's not enough that a film like "Moulin Rouge" blows their mind and their preconceptions, they need the bass cranked and for it to shake them out of their seats. The on screen love between Satine and Christian was enough for me. Go watch this film, and please do as I did and keep an open mind and heart, you will not be dissapointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is VERY obviously a Baz Luhrmann film. With all the trademarks of his previous ventures it begins with the promise of greatness. Unfortunately there is something lacking and I can only surmise that it is heart. There are some fantastic moments in this film and the actors are all perfectly cast and beautifully portrayed, however, in hind-sight there is nothing new in the movie which would warrant a return viewing. I also thought there were a few opportunities missed, which may have made the film more enjoyable, albeit more predictable. Moulin Rouge was an interesting attempt from a director who has so much more to offer. Maybe a smaller budget and less hype will allow him to experiment once again and hopefully next time hit the mark. See it once, but I doubt you will see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to be able to simply say "wow" and let you see the movie for yourself:Wow.However there are a lot of really ignorant reviews coming out about this wonderful movie so I will try to persuade you, dear visitor, why you should believe me and not Kenneth Turan of the LA Times, or whoever you are unfortunate enough to be saddled with in your local paper.Moulin Rouge is a post-modern, filmic "La Boheme"; that is to say, it is an opera. Unlike the opera you can see at your local Opera House, though, this movie is thoroughly contemporary, not only in its selection of music, but also in its organizing aesthetic, which is related to, but not derivative of, MTV music videos.As opera, in its heyday, incorporated elements of all the other arts (literature, music, theater, painting), Moulin Rouge, as a contemporary opera, incorporates the arts of our day: all of the above, plus movies, rock and roll, and booty-shaking nightclub dancing. In both the classic opera, and in Baz Luhrmann's movie, there is that sense of being confronted with a work that is pulling out all the stops, that is "letting it rip". It is an intimidating type of art if you are looking for a mildly pleasant diversion, but a richly rewarding one if you're willing to go along for the ride.A lot of reviews are criticizing the editing as being overly aggressive, too fast, jumpy, discombobulating.I think these reviewers, having correctly observed such irritating habits in director Luhrmann's last movie, "Romeo + Juliet", were, shall we say, overly sensitive to that issue before the movie even started, and have failed to appreciate the picture editing for what it is: fast, yes, but smooth, propulsive, and functional. The editors have created a Dadaist marvel that manages at the same time keeps you in touch with the story, the characters emotions, and the physical geography of each scene. If there is ever a moment where physical space becomes abstract, it is by design, as the movie slides back and forth between traditional narrative space, and a presentational, music-theater aesthetic.Don't be misled: this is not the kind of quote-unquote "MTV editing" that sours rotten action pics like "ConAir" and other assorted Hollywood crap. This is a visual tour de force that will take you on a nearly psychadelic voyage through an imaginary Paris.The musical choices are extremely bold. This is a film that could have, ought to have, in fact, turned out as embarrassing and campy as the Peter Frampton/Bee Gee's disaster "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band." It is a measure of the director's self-confidence that he dances so far out on a limb that the leaves tickle the ground, inviting disaster, but never falls from his perch.Nicole Kidman gives, I think, her best performance yet. Ewan MacGregor is the complete leading man. It's great to watch them together on screen. They are both real actors in an era when most are not.I spent probably too much time worrying that the movie, like most, was going to fall apart before they managed to find their way to the end of the story. You needn't worry, when you watch it: this movie works, like a charm. The crowd I saw it with tonight (opening weekend, LA) burst into applause at one point midway through the second act. That NEVER happens in LA. It was a deeply satisfied crowd that left the theater. Don't believe the jaded reviewers who have lost to much of their imagination to take Luhrmann's wild ride: go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a visually stunning film! It is an incredible treat for the senses. This one must be seen on a BIG screen with BIG sound to be properly appreciated. The soundtrack and performances are wonderful, but this movie gets highest marks for production design and direction. The unique, fantastical world created here is reminiscent of the magic done by Jeunet and Caro but with some Peter Pan dust thrown in. The story is essentially very short and seems stretched out, but the extra space is filled with lots of moving fun. This is a period piece that doesn't stay in any one period. The special effects seem groundbreaking, and the refreshing thing is that the big budget F/X aren't used for car chases, fighting scenes or aerial acrobatics. It's high action romance. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Aussie style meister Baz Lurhman in collaboration with his designer wife Catherine Martin and director of photography Don McAlpine have made Moulin Rouge their own. Nicole Kidman holds a tune to perfection singing a few songs on a soundtrack so diverse with something for everbody indeed. She plays the untouchable unless you have money, a-lot of it, main attraction at Paris's most famous night club. Along comes a gifted poet (Ewan Mc Gregor) who has a knack for writing romance in prose which will in-turn become famous romantic songs in the future. They're unlikely love affair is opposed by an evil, rich English Duke (Richard Roxburgh) and he will stop at nothing to bed his woman. This film does not let you take a breath. Filmed entirely at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, Moulin Rouge dazzled me and is wickedly romantic in a blaze of extrordinary color.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Baz Luhrman has been one of my favourite directors since Strictly Ballroom and when you combine him with Ewan and Nicole it is just magic to behold. This film ROCKED. Finally a musical that's been made in the last 20 years that I can show my friends and not worry about them cringing when the actors start singing. It seems perfectly natural. I just hope this film is seen and loved by a truckload of money wielding people all around the world, making it impossible to ignore come trophy time.I saw this film with quite a few people, all from diffrent walks of life, we all loved it and were all crashing into tower to buy the soundtrack. Anyone who even REMOTELY likes production design and costumes MUST see this movie. THE best part of this movie is that though it has its sad moments, it is also incredibly hilarious at the same time. I don't want to give anything away but there is one production number that will drive you BONKERS crazy laughing!!For people complaining about not enough dancing, rent the DVD when it comes out for the extended dance sequences or better yet, rent an old time musical or go se a broadway play. I LOVE dancing but long camera take on leg kicking and hip shaking would have divided the target audience. An instant classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not surprised that so many (not all) men don't appreciate this film. I'm not surprised that they obsess over the fact that they've heard the music before, over camera angles and other minutia. Many men are like that. They can't let go and embrace sentiment. Most are simply not capable. How any ordinary movie goer or critic could see this movie and not be moved by the intensity of Christian and Satin's feelings for one another is beyond my comprehension. When I saw the film, I was flabbergasted at how much attention had been paid to complaining about unimportant trifles. Shocked that so many had proclaimed that Christian and Satin had no chemistry, I nonetheless sat enraptured whenever they were on screen together. That so many could have watched this and felt nothing for the two lovers is a sad sign of just how jaded young people have become in this day and age. It's SAD. It's not surprising, though. Critics panned "It's a Wonderful Life." What do they know?Ewan McGregor is a romantic the likes of which I haven't seen onscreen in many a year. I thought I was jaded until I saw this film. What a voice on that man!! I was thinking, "Oh my goodness, that's Renton the toilet boy singing like Harry Connick, Jr.!!" The girls beside me were swooning whenever he sang, as was I. What a perfect wide-eyed innocent. That this actor can convincingly portray characters as diverse as Mark Renton and Christian is a testament to his phenomenal talent. There aren't many actors who are his equal, and Nicole's star power should certainly be elevated by her charming performance. What a cutie she is!! One can understand why Christian was so captivated by her.As for the rest of the movie, what is everyone complaining about? It was a wild, dizzying, gaudy, decadent spectacle of a ride--as Baz intended it to be. This world was intended to be surreal to the extreme. It wasn't meant to accurately reflect 1899 Paris. Of course it wasn't!!! So you get a little dizzy, so what? The ride was wild and the reworked music was a hoot. Let go and *enjoy*. Are you all grumpy old men? It's not often a movie stays with you like this. It's the first truly great film of the year. Bravo Ewan, Nicole, Richard Roxborough and Jim Broadbent. A 9 out of 10. (Okay, that one point I took off is a concession to the fact that even *I* got a little too dizzy in some places. Switch to decaf, Baz. LOL!!) But that's okay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most original films I've seen in a loooooong time. The visuals are stunning, the stages are sumptuously detailed, especially in the production around which the film rotates (the Spectacular Spectacular).The use of modern (spectrum from the last 25 yrs or so) pop music in a 1900's Paris setting drew a big and favourable reaction from the audience with whom I saw the movie. The songs were presented in a sort of melange where one segued into another in an often hilarious way (it made one realise just how many songs about love there are out there), also using snippets of familiar songs to deal with the broad spectrum of human experience. And this movie doesn't spare us any of the harsh realities of life. In this way it is blessedly and most assuredly not a Hollywood production. Probably the best humorous effect was brought about by having two older guys singing Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' to each other. Has to be seen to be believed really.Make no mistake; this film is totally nuts but you will never forget it. The standard of singing was outstanding, especially from Nicole and Ewan who did an awesome job of it. I was rather skeptical that they'd be able to carry it off but oh my! They did more than that.You will not believe your eyes or your ears!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1899 Paris. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is an English writer trying to take in Parisian artistic life. He befriends Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo). He gets involved with Moulin Rouge star Satine (Nicole Kidman). The club owner Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent) has promise her to the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) if he would invest.It's got Baz Luhrmann's grand vision. It's a modern day musical. McGregor and Kidman are surprisingly good as singers. It's still not my taste but it's got the style right. Its excesses are what sells this movie. Anything less would reduce this to no more than musical theater. The story is melodramatic but it is in keeping with the tone of the movie. Even using modern songs as burlesque music seems somehow fitting if somewhat weird.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ya i can understand this being a musical an all,had to be a bit out of my league,but still,this is just utter disgrace to the 'musical movie' genre.Of course,it had a lot of "commercial" stuff to make this one worth the wait,but definitely not one to be missed.Well,it does have a flip side to it,as most movies do,all is not disappointing.Well, i have to admit that Nicole kidman as well as Ewan McGregor have put their best foot forward to make this a spectacle,it is (though not too pleasing to the eye),not a completely waste of effort.Richard roxburgh as the duke is quite believable as the "bad guy" here.Also,a thumbs up to Jim broadbent as the colorful Harold Zidler. overall,i would give this 6 on 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Love-It-Or-Hate-It Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Moulin Rouge!" is a romantic Jukebox musical that tells the story of a young, English poet/writer, Christian, who falls in love with the terminally-ill star of the Moulin Rouge, cabaret actress and courtesan Satine. It stars Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor together with Jim Broadbent,Richard Roxburgh,John Leguizamo,Jacek Koman and Caroline O'Connor.The film was loosely based on the opera Orpheus in the Underworld It was directed, produced, and co-written by Baz Luhrmann.Christian leaves behind his bourgeois father during the French belle époque of the late 1890's to seek his fortunes in the bohemian underworld of Montmartre, Paris. Christian meets the absinthe- and alcohol-addicted artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, who introduces him to a world of sex, drugs, music, theater, and the scandalous dance known as the cancan, all at the Moulin Rouge, a decadent dance hall, brothel, and theater that's the brainchild of Harold Zidler. Christian also meets and falls into a tragically doomed romance with the courtesan Satine, who becomes the star of the play he's writing, which parallels the couple's romance and utilizes rock music from a century later.This film is a tour de force of artifice, a dazzling pastiche of musical and visual elements at the service of a blatantly artificial story.It is all style, all giddy, over-the-top spectacle but nevertheless, it's also daring in its vision and wildly original.It is overall a "love-it-or- hate-it experience" for the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bombastic fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of Moulin Rouge, and cinema's fourth visit, is a boisterous musical journey into the famed seedy underworld of early 2oth century Paris. Visually arresting and with more energy than Tom Cruise on speed, Luhrmann's film strikes a rare balance of appearing to be on the brink of losing control while remaining sharply focused and fully on key. For a cast with no track record in musicals, there's an inherent 'holding of breath' before each characters melodic introduction and although it's clear that neither Kidman of McGregor are ever going to win awards for vocal prowess, their commitment and respective charms are more than enough to keep the central love story alive while allowing us to marvel at the stunning musical arrangements that cover a colourful medley of everything from Rogers and Hammerstein to Nirvana. Beyond all the razzamatazz and histrionics there lies a central love story. That such a thing as true love could exist in a world fuelled by exploitation and sex is an excellent jumping off point for the story of Christian (Ewan Mcgregor) who as a writer, has come to Paris to capture a flavour of the infectious bohemian spirit perpetuated at the lively Moulin Rouge. It's there that Christian encounters Satine (Nicole Kidman) who as the nightclub's most coveted attraction embodies all the traits of the tortured starlet. Satine is beautiful and talented, but her ambition to attain fame beyond the confines of 'the rouge' means selling herself to the extent of sacrificing personal happiness in favour of stardom. Christians naivety and innocence is attractive to Satine and his ability to break through the illusion and lies of her world begin to entice her away from the things she has always strived for. Circling like a predator is 'The Duke' (Richard Roxburgh) who forms the third part of a dangerous love triangle. The Duke is a powerful man with the means to provide Satine with her big break, but only for the price of her affections which gives way to an emotional tug-of-war played out through a series of perfectly bombastic song and dance numbers. At times it becomes a game of name that tune as one infectious melody merges into another. One number that threatens to steal the show is Jim Broadbent's 'Like A Virgin', which is so over the top in delivery that it's hard to deny a constant smile. Indeed, for much of the runtime, the film aims to captivate and arouse that sense of cheeky, nod-nod-wink-wink humour in way that's never overly salacious and falls on the right side of good taste. In summary, a good old fashioned story of love set against a decadent backdrop and told with an agreeably trippy verve with likable performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well it was good enough for an Oscar wasn't it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so here we go, another review of a film I also worked on. I was the head Art Dept Electrician on this film, meaning just about every light globe you see in every frame (and there are certainly a lot, possibly more than any other film in history) was put there either by myself or one of the four others on my team. But enough of that.In production, Moulin was a film where few crew knew what the film was about until we sat and watched it at the preview 12 months later. Both then and now, it blows my mind to watch such an enjoyable, indulgent and extravagant production - one of the few I can think of where the viewer really gets to see so much of what happened in front of the camera.For an art department crew member, watching a film you've worked on is so often like watching life through a keyhole. You know there was so much there but so little of it can ever be seen in the final cut. Not with "Moulin Rouge"! Watching Every frame, every word, every song is like soaking yourself in a bath of creativity where there were no rules or if there was, they were often invisible.The Oscar (won for Best Production design) is rightly claimed. Whilst the performances, music and cinematography are all excellent, it's the unique designs that really jump out of the screen throughout the entire film. The success of "Moulin" as an artistic masterpiece is testament to the Australian way of film making, where art comes by way of cooperation, communication and a common drive to deliver the cast and director the best environment possible in which to present the story and performance. It's a long way from the "Frustrated Incorporated" way of working so common to American productions where time constraints often lead to sub standard results.So why an 8 and not a 10? "Moulin Rouge" in the end fell victim to Fox Studios Australia, displacing the production in May 2000 in favour of George Lucas' Star Wars prequel. As a result of this two major key sets were demolished well before time and well before it was possible to create the necessary special effect shots needed to bring the film to reality.This resulted in the construction of a number of additional scale models (at another studio) which were inevitably used for these mo-con shots - and resulted in the famed "longest mo con shots in film for this week".To most viewers, Moulin seems fine. But to me, and despite enormous effort to prevent it, the continuous multitude of continuity and lighting errors that abound in "Moulin" (where scenes cut back and forth from the real life to the model sets) is an ever present annoyance, preventing me from ever fully entering the director's intended world as it was planned to be. For this reason, Moulin will never be what it could have been - and stands as a warning to anyone who plans to outstay their welcome at a Fox studio.Still, it was good enough for an Oscar, and I guess (being in the department that earned it that Oscar) I should be (and am) satisfied. I do sometimes wonder what it might have looked like though had the producers gone ahead with their initial plans to build a full size outdoor back lot, thus avoiding the troubles at Fox and obviating the need for all that expensive mucking about with scale models afterwards.Moulin was a wild ride (both on and off screen) and I'll never forget it.And I guarantee, neither will you.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this when it first came out, although didn't particularly want to at the time (not keen on Nicole Kidman). However, I was blown away by it especially as a big-screen experience, it was AWESOME. Never before or since have I seen a British cinema audience stand up and applaud a movie during the closing credits. For a visual and audio experience beyond all expectations, watch this movie. McGregor and Kidman have well-matched voices, and who would have thought either could sing so well. Jim Broadbent is, as always, OTT and immensely watchable. All the other characters are well-cast. The use of existing music tracks is genius, they are chosen well. Sets and costumes fantastic. I've just seen this again, and its as fresh and exciting as originally. Compulsive viewing - watch it please. Baz Luhrman rocks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm not sure if I appreciate Baz Luhrmann's style...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When 'Moulin Rouge!' came out, in 2001, its director, Baz Luhrmann, was already 39 years old, but had made only three other movies, 'Strictly Ballroom' and 'Romeo + Juliet'. So, assuming this is only his third film, and the third of his 'Red Curtain Trilogy', he still has a lot to grow as a director, after all, it generally takes years for a director to hit the jackpot, but of course there are exceptions like John Huston and his exceptional 'The Maltese Falcon' as his first movie.'Moulin Rouge!' tells the story of Christian (Ewan McCregor), a young English writer that travels to 1899 Bohemian Paris. There, he meets Satine (Nicole Kidman), the star courtesan of the Moulin Rouge, the main nightclub of the city underworld. The problem is when he falls in love with her, but she is already committed to The Duke (Richard Roxburgh), a very rich man. Throughout the movie, most of the main characters tell the audience that this is a story about Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all things, love. And it is indeed. All four of them are a very important part of the story, which is very well-told, by the way, starting off a year after the main events, with Christian writing what happened. And it's all told with really good dance numbers.The acting is nice. We have the two leads, Ewan McCregor and Nicole Kidman, playing their parts well, and singing their own songs. We have other stars like John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh. No one really stands out, but you can see the actors did their jobs exactly as they were told to. As I mentioned, Baz Luhrmann still has a lot to grow as a director, but at least the guy has a lot of style. The landscapes of Paris were one of the best scenes I've seen in a musical, great mix-up of 3-D effects and real shots. You can see all his potential in those scenes. This movie is a perfect portrayal of Bohemian Paris, wild, senseless, and weird. The way he mixed up lots of famous songs of the 20th century to tell the story is brilliant. In here, we have songs by Madonna, David Bowie, Ozzy Osbourne, Nirvana and many others, and it works really good. The art direction is excellent, but too modern for my taste. The main problem I have with this movie is the editing, too claustrophobic. When you start to get into one scene, it jumps to another and you get dazzled.Overral, even though I'm not sure if I appreciate Baz Luhrmann's style, it's undeniable the effort he and his crew putted into the making of this movie. The problem I have with 'Moulin Rouge!' is simply a matter of taste - too modern for me.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My buddy's story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend of mine went through something not too dissimilar to this. He fell for a woman who died her hair a dark red tint, who was attractive, and seemed to express an interest in him. Regrettably for him it turned out to be false. And, like Kidman's character, this woman had her set of problems, physical and emotional. But the dude, an aspiring writer, kept going back for more thinking he could win her.It didn't work out in the end. He had his high ideals about love: What it ought to be, with whom, and how it should manifest. But, like most films, the end of Moulin Rogue ends a bit more dramatically, and, in spite of the rough ending, emotionally better than my buddy's story, though, again ironically, reality turned out to be better than the film because no one died of tuberculosis (or anything else for that matter).The film shows the story of the naiveté of a young idealist writer who throws himself into the realm of the seamy Parisian underworld, and falls for a woman who only "loves" him for what he can do for her and her confederates. During the course of the story there are some emotional twists.It's a light and fancy melodrama with some dark undercurrents that keeps the tension fun and gripping. MacGregor and Kidman have real chemistry in this kitschy effort, which again melds with the overall thrust of the film to tell us a tale of Bohemian values and their short comings in a world fraught with survivalist concerns.Realities of life color and pull at the facade of the fairy tale the characters hope to live. The dark presence, the antagonist, plays no real part in the fate of the drama, but adds much needed tension to the story (however much despised he is by the rest of the characters). In the end we see his part as being trivial at best.And therein lies the larger message of the film. Would the story have had the end had everyone followed their hearts in the first place? Would the couple have met? Would they have ended on better terms, albethey without one another? To what purpose does lording wealth, over those who need it, serve? Money truly does not buy happiness.There's a definite theme of honesty undulating here. Betrayal served a purpose for those involved, but did it serve a higher purpose? Was it worth it? This is the question the film poses to the audience.Stylistically it's a bit hard to take. The film itself is like a giant MTV music video. A high concept music promo film shot on an astronomical scale and budget. There's lots of cuts, manipulation of camera speed, miniature work and other special effects blended with some epic dance sequences the likes of which haven't been seen since Busby Berkley.All in all it's a heady film that's worth seeing at least once. I missed it in the theatres, but bought the special collector's DVD when it hit the store shelves, and don't regret it one bit.If I had a nitpick, and I'm not sure that I do, it might be with some of the tunes chosen for the musical sequences. They're songs I was familiar with, and I think that lends the film a kind of youthful credibility, but or two original songs might've been welcome.Ewan MacGregor is dashing and Nicole Kidman is ravishing as always. They make a fine couple, and tug at our heart's sentiment.Definitely worth renting or owning.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What beauty, what style, what grander Moulin Rouge is all that and more. Moulin Rouge is a beautiful and extremely intriguing film that is lush and lavish, Moulin Rouge's story is told by a love struck writer who while living in Paris trying to find the inspiration for his book, finds it in the strikingly beautiful Satine, a burlesque dancer at The Moulin Rouge.Moulin Rouge is a spectacular film that just rolls off the screen and sweeps you into another world of mystery and magic, Baz Lurhmann directs and writes for this sweeping musical/comedy that just to good to over look. This film has no low points but allot of high points, this film has amazing visual effects and amazing musical numbers( some of which you might know.) This movie also has many well know actors in it that all contribute to the films atmosphere and style, all the actors and actresses do an exceptional job in there parts, they make the roles feel so real and make there characters look and feel special in there own way. Tish movie isn't just another, it's a magical trip that you won't want to miss no matter what. All aboard the next stop, The Moulin Rouge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A would-be stage delight done a disservice on the screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, Moulin Rouge!. The spectacle to end all spectacles, the film that supposedly revived the flagged musical genre. This is the film that presumably, generations down the line, begat Julie Taymor's Across the Universe, a film that is obvious, poorly-acted, one-dimensional, patchwork, and frequently damn silly. It was also a film that was gloriously captivating, thanks to its tremendous visual sensibility, the soaring musical arrangements and the confidence in the material to play it seriously and believe that it would still succeed on its merits. Moulin Rouge! is a film that has so many of the same drawbacks, but fails to support its failings as Taymor did. The film is very, VERY bright and excited, but makes it mistake in thinking that being loud and obnoxious is the same as being vibrant and spectacular.Even with this, the film's main problem is that it's so goddamn cheeky. It picks songs that they know an audience will giggle about hearing played orchestrally ("Wouldn't it be funny if we had Jim Broadbent sing "Like a Virgin"?" "Ahahaha, genius") and then have every single actor play DIRECTLY TO THE CAMERA, which apparently allows them to throw of all pretence of subtlety and pummel each line into cheap-chuckle submission, with only Ewan McGregor coming out unscathed. Not a single action is taken for the characters' benefit, not a single line is said because it's realistic in context; every single beat is insistently directed straight to the audience's ugly mugs, just to make SURE that they have a good, cheap laugh, or are aware that they're singing another song the audience should know. "REMEMBER THAT ONE?! HO HO, YOU LOVED THAT SONG, WASN'T THAT FUNNY?!" It's only one the nonsense calms down (for instance, during the 'love medley' does the film become anywhere near the sort of subtle, delicate sweetness that makes for a touching love scene.It's a lot like being on stage, really, and trying to appeal directly to the base, the simple, the Groundlings, if you will, and, perhaps not coincidentally, the only time the film gets any real traction, is when they move the film...to the stage! The audience, the lights, the sound, and especially the improvisation! In fact, this finale is so tremendously rousing that it damn near saves the entire film (and will probably garner it an entire half-point in my score. The fact is, this is a film that would be a spectacular-spectacular theatrical revue, but people, at least, this person, looks for completely different things from the stage and the screen. I was part of a local theatrical production called Everyman, which was a stupid, simplistic story (the kind where characters' personalities are in their names) held up by our director's choice of cheesy, obvious pop songs, but thanks to energy and the buzz amongst the crowd, the show was a rousing success, and many of those famous songs I have come to closely associate with that show. But it would lose everything on the screen, because despite their similarities, they're wholly different mediums, and trying to do something so suited for one in the realm of the other just results in inconsistent, unholy mediocrities like Moulin Rouge!.{Grade: 5.5/10 (C+/C) / #60 (of 68) of 2001}</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that Moulin Rouge is an optically lush film, the set designs and costumes were magnificent, however I found Nicole Kidmans panting, pretty performance as a dying prostitute with a heart all too familiar, all too clichéd and all too irritating. Looking back at Ewan Mcgregor I think that his performance was actually quite wooden, and by-god the portrayal of Henri Toulouse Lautrec as a homo-sexual, camp little clown was maniacal beyond belief! I hate the way Baz Lurhman and his friends have taken some of the 20th Centurys most influential songs such as Queens 'The show must go on', Nirvanas 'Smells like teen spirit' and many others and used them as kidnapped material devices to illustrate their characters self-indulgent, careless, quite frankly brat-like lifestyles of filthy sex, drugs and {the most sickening of all} their fetid idea of what Art is. At times, this was like watching a Kylie Minogue:The Movie. A kiwi ego-maniac drenched in feathers and jewels dancing around whilst playing a vintage actress/ sensitive showgirl was just so clichéd to me. Burlesque and all that stagy splendour is something we see so much of nowadays with girl bands and various other movies like Chicago. I look back at this film and think of it as a giant, sexed-up, arrogant music video with a vintage theme. It makes me feel rather sick and angry. Perhaps the most perplexing, mind-numbingly annoying thing about this film is that Lurhman obviously thinks he has achieved something completely out of the ordinary, and all of his 14+-teeny-bopper-bimbo-simple-minded audience has fallen for this frothy, foamy, glittery,red-curtain whirl of a pop-video movie. I think that Bazza and co made a considerable attempt at moving the audience, but in the end i just found their endeavours to be melodramatic, artificial and so very calculated. People are supposed to pity Satine because shes a whore who wants to 'fly away' from the Moulin Rouge. Why would she want to do that? At the Moulin Rouge, she is the complete star, dressed from head to toe in finery most 19th Century whores could only dream of, with her own private boudoir, luxuries and a host of men who will pay hundreds to spend time with her - furthermore, she gets to choose which of these men she sleeps with. What more could she possibly want? Freedom? She and her tacky 'bohemian' friends prove that they have all the freedom they need. In fact, they have so much freedom, they are dumbfounded by it, and don't know what to do with it other than take drugs, dance to orgasmic music and create ridiculous barriers for themselves so that they can weep into their red velvet curtains about how supposedly bleak and tormented their lives are. Apparently the inhabitants of the Moulin Rouge are 'creatures of the underworld who can't afford to love'. I have never heard such nonsense in all my life - considering the fact that such a teary-eyed, rosy-cheeked sob story is coming from a bunch of circus performers who spend the entire movie giggling, grinning and drowning in a blissful, decadent, non-stop party where there is an abundance of their definition of the word 'love' aka corseted sex or whimpering shining-eyed whims of 20th Century pop-song valentines day tag-lines. I couldn't find any philosophy, any depth, any art or anything original in this movie. The visuals were rather superb, especially the Hindi-Influenced "Spectacular, Spectacular", but the plot was bland and it was an infuriatingly patchwork montage of other peoples songs, musical work, operas and tragic story lines. The performances were very deliberate, thespian...almost as if the actors/actresses knew exactly how startled and boggle-eyed the more approving members of the audience would be. It was like watching a bunch of people who were in love with the idea of their own performances, and spent most of the movie flirting with their own images in the lens of the out of control cameras. Beauty, Freedom, Truth and Love are handsome things to have faith in, and I adore the romantic, unconventional history of the 1900s theatrical scene in Europe, and that is probably why this movie makes me so mad. I feel it has hijacked and raped history, 20th Century rock and roll, and the very elements of Parisian Art, and then dressed these things up to a sickly sweet Dame-Edna-Extremity. This film is an excuse for actors and actresses to have some fun dressing up in major flamboyant burlesque outfits and producing a soundtrack of their panto-party for all the world to witness. At the worst I found this to be an overpowering, alcoholic, destructive, emotionally-and-spiritually shallow joyride which makes nothing but attempts. As a final note, I really expected The so-called 'bohemians' {or should i say in their case 'bwo-hwemi-ans'} to see something out-of-the-ordinary and inspiring once they drunk the famous poet-pushing-dream-inducing liquor Absinthe...but instead, all they saw was Kylie in another one of her Dolce&amp;Gabbanna-John-Galliano-Encrusted-Twinkling-Show-girl costumes singing an Andrew Lloyd Webber number. Good Grief, how useless is absinthe? What does one have to drink in order to see something REALLY inspiring?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the Moulin Rouge!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when Moulin Rouge came out in 2001, it was the movie that I had refused to see, it just never really did appeal to me. But my mom bought me a three pack DVD of the "Romantic Tales", Romeo and Juliet, Ever After, and Moulin Rouge! Now I saw Romeo and Juliet and Ever After, figuring, what the heck? I'll give Moulin Rouge a go, I watched it tonite and I have to say that this film is a thousand times better than what I thought it was going to be. Moulin Rouge is visually spectacular and the music is a lot of fun, the actors looked like they had the time of their lives making this film. This is the musical that are the ultimate must see's, it had the perfect amount of fun, magic, romance, and passion. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman had sizzling chemistry and were just beautiful on the screen together, they brought the Moulin Rouge to life and made it an unforgettable experience.Christian is a struggling poet who comes to Paris to find some inspiration during the revolution. He goes to the deep underworld of theater where poor and rich alike could discover the Moulin Rouge! A fun club starring radiant and beautiful Satine. Satine and Christian have a passionate love affair together and dream of running away together, but Satine is loved by another man, the duke, who could keep the Moulin Rouge alive if she returns the love back. But she's so in love with Christian, they try to keep their relationship quiet, but things become more horrible when Satine finds out about a fatal illness and is struggling to love Christian and try to keep her club jamming.Moulin Rouge the sets, the costumes, the lights, everything about this film is just so much fun to watch. When I first started watching it, I was a little thrown off, I'm sure you will be too, but just keep going with the film, you'll fall in love with it too. Nicole Kidman was just absolutely stunning, she was the perfect choice for Satine. Ewan McGregor had an amazing voice and once again, I don't think there could have been a better choice, I loved their last scene together, it's beautifully acted, well, I'm not going to give it away, just trust me. I recommend Moulin Rouge, it's a fun musical that is guaranteed to give you a good time.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My fiancée, whom I love dearly, had been bugging me to see this movie since we began dating. Now, she is a huge Star Wars fan, and I began to suspect this may have been a case of Ewan-desire and not so much for the movie itself. I still think that's the case. However, I also went into this expecting to enjoy it because I adore musicals. I pointed out that I would have walked out of the theater during the chaotic, pointless beginning but was glad she told me it was a good movie, possibly had a bad beginning. (Side note here: Why do movies perpetuate the myth that Absinthe does.. well.. anything? It's just an anise wine. It's a clean drunk and nothing more, people. Yes, Wormwood is an hallucinogenic... BUT ONLY IN DOSES BIG ENOUGH TO KILL AN ELEPHANT!!) My walk out instinct would have been correct. What a piece of garbage... from the music on down to the plot. The second I heard something from Nirvana, my guts recoiled. But I thought it was a onetime thing just to be cute. Then the movie went on and on and on and on with that crap. Hey, when you're writing a musical? Write at least one or two of your own bleeping songs. Unoriginal hack. Even the big romantic number, Come What May? I can't place it exactly but I am SURE I've heard it before.My fiancée can attest that I knew everything that was going to happen as surely as I could sing the next line of almost every song before the characters did. I said "She's going to die of some illness." about 10 seconds after she started dancing with Ewan's character. According to her we were told she dies at the beginning.. but I wasn't in the room yet. The plot was stiflingly boring and predictable, replete with the obligatory forced part wherein Satine tries to convince what's-his-name that she didn't love him. Blah blah blah money, blah blah dying. Blah blah all rich people are evil. Yammer patter whore with a heart of gold. Art and love are truth blah blah the show must go on yammer blah blah. *Yawn* At any point after the first 15 minutes I could have paused the movie, told her the rest of the story, and only have missed some pointless subplot about the proposed ending of the play.This gets a 2, at least, because.. hey Ewan can SING! And sing WELL. It's just painful to hear WHAT they made him sing.And I don't care what the directors and whatnot say. Nicole Kidman is not singing in this movie. She is so obviously lip-syncing it that it's painful to watch.MY overall advice? The beginning was a great hint that I would have been wise to take. This movie is all flash and pretty swirly distracting stuff....incidentally, nobody would ever refer to the famous dance as doing the "can can can". When you say it three times, it means something about Euclidean geometry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Words can barely describe this movie. It is original that if for sure. The characters are absolutely brilliant and Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor have voices of angels. The story follows Christian, a writer who moves to France near the Moulin Rouge. The dirty underworld of drugs and hookers. However, when fate takes him there one night he sees the shows lead star. The diamond, Shantine. He quickly falls in love but she is caught between everything she knows and a strange feeling. Love. The Moulin Rouge show is trying to sell her off with a foul duke who offers her everything. She must choose between love or live with a fee which she has taught herself to take from everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artsy &amp; "Spectacular! Spectacular!" Movie-making at its Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann is a visionary. What a joy it must have been to work with him on this ambitious project. He took the simple theme of "Love" and made it into something ravishing, seductive and new. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman were outstanding in their heartfelt portrayals. This rendition of storytelling was offbeat and new - but it was brilliant. My hat goes off to this production team for their effort at making this come off successfully (not just in terms of box office success but more importantly in artistic merit). The collage of musical numbers put together would have been more than enough for most movie producers to handle but this film enjoys many avenues of delightful artistic achievement that it would take a small volume just to review the highlights of them all. Using the singing voices of the actors lends an air of authenticity and realism which pays off handsomely with a successful emotional tugging at the heartstrings. This is as successful an artistic attempt as "Chicago" the musical is a failure. Hollywood just knee-jerked a reaction the following year to this "foreign" film by producing "Chicago" which has absolutely no storyline of consequence and certainly no artistic worthiness. The acting is pathetic and Hollywood failed in its attempt to come back with a superior film to "Moulin Rouge", although they gave it every award under the sun to save face. Doesn't pride come before a fall? The fact is Hollywood is not producing the best films anymore and they just cannot accept it. Too bad! Maybe it is time for them to clean up their act! Good Luck to them! Meanwhile "Moulin Rouge" stands out as a beacon of light and hope for the future of movie-making around the world. A simple love story told beautifully is better than no story told with angst and glitz!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*~*moulin rouge review*~*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...LOVE this is a story about LOVE music is the food of LOVE nothing matters but LOVE...Moulin Rouge is a romantic musical, it came out in 2001 and was directed by the talented Baz Luhrmann. The film tells the story of Christian (Ewan McGregor), a penniless bohemian, who comes to Paris to write, and falls in love with Satine, a can-can dancer at the famed Moulin Rouge. Christian plots to make the lovely Satine (Nicole Kidman) fall in love with him. The innocent Christian finds himself deep inside a world of sex, drugs, and the true bohemian life. Christian faces many obstacles, for example a duke who wants to trade Satine's favors for money to build a proper theater at the Moulin Rouge. Christian believes that love will overcome all, and his time in Paris helps him to decide if there is truth to the statement "the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return."Being that it is a love story, I would say that the main theme of Moulin Rouge is love. The plot of the film is centered around the love story of Christian and Satine. Other themes of the movie could be deception, freedom, or beauty.I've only seen one other film directed by Baz Luhrmann, Romeo + Juliet, and it is one of my favorite movies. After seeing both films, I'd say that the style of both movies is very similar. I think there are similarities in the not only the plot and themes, but also the lighting, choice of actors and actresses, and style of filming. Both films have a similar style and I think Baz Luhrmann's unique direction shows itself in these films. Moulin Rouge is a extraordinarily extravagant film. The starring actors Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, John Leguizamo, and Jim Broadbent all do a great job of playing their parts. One of my favorite aspects of this movie is that it is a musical. Before seeing it I never knew that Nicole Kidman or Ewan McGregor had such powerful singing voices. I think their voices make the movie even better; not only are they great actors, but also great singers. The costumes and sets of the movie are also good. Moulin Rouge takes place in Paris, 1899 and 1900. The set of the Moulin Rouge itself is amazing in the film. It's really impressive and cool how elaborate the sets in the movie are. Very dramatic and vintage, the sets of the movie make you feel like you really are in the midst of the bohemian revolution in Paris. The costumes of the film are also incredible. Every outfit Satine wears is perfectly glamorous and beautiful. Baz Luhrmann did a great job of completing his vision for Moulin Rouge. The film is a musical, and includes many well-written musical pieces. The lyrics between Christian and Satine make you feel the intense love between them. Songs like Complainte de la Butte, Smells Like Teen Spirit, and Your Song also come together to complete the Moulin Rouge soundtrack. I found this film to be very good, I can easily see how anyone would chose it as one of their favorite films. Baz Lurhmann is a very talented director who created a masterpiece with Moulin Rouge.******************************************************************</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Rouge! A Sparkling Diamond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge! it's a very entertaining musical film. With a great cast: including Ewan McGregor &amp; Nicole Kidman, giving one of her best performances. One of the best things of the film is the set-decoration and costume design. Wonderful! The soundtrack is one of my favorites. It contains in the same song a part from a song of KISS (I was made for loving you) and Elton John (YOUR SONG)or in SPARKLING DIAMONDS, Marylin Monroe (DIAMONDS ARE GIRL'S BEST FRIEND) and Madonna's (MATERIAL GIRL). My favorites songs are: .Lady Marmalade: the most famous song of the film. It's a super-mega-hit performed by Christina Aguilera, Pink, Lil Kim, Mya and Missy Elliot. .Sparkling Diamonds: great medley of Diamonds are... and Material Girl. When Nicole sings it in the film it's fantastic. .Your song: a lot of sensitive. .Children of the revolution: great song performed by Bono and many more. .One day I'll fly away: Nicole sings it very well. .Diamond dogs: I love this song. The lyrics and the melody are impressive. .The Elephant love medley: The best medley of the film. And the performances are so good. .Come What May: I think that's the best song of the film. Ewan and Nicole do it perfect! .Complain de la Butte: French good song. .Hindi sad diamonds: Strange song but I like it. .Like a virgin: So good. .Meet me in the red room: special. The music is amazing. .Show must go on: VERY VERY GOOD! And the song is one of the best of Queen.The other songs are: Nature Boy, Because we can, Rhythm of the night, Tango de Roxanne, The Pitch and Bolero.The argument of the film is so typical. A history of love, about a man and a woman that they can't be lovers.A part from this, it's so wonderful and enchanting. Don't miss it! I Love Moulin Rouge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Refreshing Burst of creativity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A story about truth, beauty, freedom, and love? And loving it is hardly a challenging task when this magical story is displayed on the screen. Moulin Rouge throws a surprising twist on what seems to be an overused theme of "love" in Hollywood. Is it overused? Well, after watching this film, I found myself reconsidering the meaning of "love" as a cinematic theme and concluded that my previous definition was to be taken off the shelf; it is now well expired.It is a movie I entered with ambivalent to low expectations. For all I knew, I was in for another ride down the musical roller coaster, and this one was going to make me really sick ("oh no, here comes another long song about love, where's the barf bag?") Instead, I was treated to one of the most phenomenal stories ever captured on film, told with such creativity and originality that I knew there had to something wrong with it. How am I so easily falling for this fantasy/comedy/musical/drama/documentary?(wait, did I say documentary? Well yes, this was a fantastic narrative that was really told biographically, so in a "let's-not-get-too-technical-about-film-terms" sort of way, was a fictional documentary).And I thought I'd seen and heard it all just when I realized, "wait, I did." Most all of the songs performed were readapted famous singles already made famous by such artists as Elton John, Madonna, The Police, and Nirvana, yet I found every performance to be beyond delightful, entertaining, amusing, and most of all, inventive; these performances pieced together every mood of the story, collectively seducing me, and with no sense of time, I was in love with this movie.Moulin Rouge sets not only a standard for musicals but a standard for the entire film industry. When the next movie comes along with musical performances that seem to actually improve the original song, more than impressive booming vocal performances by the two leads, a story that carries the viewer a fantasy world that for once feels so real, I'll be the first person to buy the ticket. But wait, on second thought, I must keep in mind the old saying, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." This film deserves to be that single original gem, and should never be sought to be improved, recreated, or just copied in the form of another "unoriginal film", instead, this cinematic achievement should be set aside and just appreciated and glorified for all that it has accomplished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(NOTE this comment contains a spoiler) Here's what I think of Moulin Rouge!. When I watched this movie for the first time, I was thinking that it was OK. But then I watched it again and I loved it. But to most people this movie seems weird, not to me. It wasn't weird at all, to me it's just "Spectacular".There are many reasons why I love this film. Here are all of my reasons for loving this film. I liked the first half of the film a lot because it's very fast paced. The second half of the movie is when the drama kicks in and still very good. I loved most of the songs that are sung by Ewan McGregor &amp; Nicole Kidman. Finally I think Nicole Kidman &amp; Ewan McGregor are perfect in this film, their acting and singing are just amazing!!.And now the downfalls of Moulin Rouge! since I liked "Satine" so much, I didn't like that at the end of the movie she dies. Well, that's it.Overall I'd highly recommend for you to watch this movie, that is if you want to see a great romantic drama that's also a musical. I really enjoyed watching this film and I think you will too, and that's why I rate Moulin Rouge! an (8.7/10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a wonderful work of art in every sense. From the theatrical opening sequence, to the brilliant colors and dazzling sets, you realize this is not just another movie musical. A story of love and the hazards thereof, that is as old as time, yet brought to life with the use of modern songs and music. Many of the tunes were originally solo performances, now broken into duets that seem to breathe new life into the lyrics. The direction is crisp, moving forward with the speed and agility of the lovers themselves. This cast is without question universally talented. The singing is strong, the dance clean, and the acting passionate and powerful without going over the top. Worth watching over and over again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A celebration of color and catchy musical numbers which explode unto the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shortly before there were Chicago and Dreamgirls (and all the others of their likes), there was Moulin Rouge. The film that revived the musical genre and made it relevant once again is a celebration of color and catchy musical numbers which explode unto the screen in a whirlpool of emotions.The plot brings us the story of a turn of the 20th century English poet living in France (Ewan McGregor in one of his best performance), who binds forces with a group of local bohemians, who urge him to write a musical play for the Moulin Rouge, a famous nightclub in Paris. A series of identity mistakes leads him to the Rouge's lead star (Nicole Kidman), who hasn't the faintest idea he is but a poor poet. The music comes in gear frequently across the movie, combining mid to late 20th century pop numbers with the dazzling re-staging of the 1899 France. Kidman and McGregor sing to each other about heart ache, about class differences and about love in a free and better world. When McGregor sings Elton John's "Your Song" with the stars and moon twinkling behind him, real magic sends vibrations and electricity through the screen and into the viewer's heart. In fact, it seems as though Australian director Baz Luhrmann did such a great job this time around, he didn't shoot another film since (check his IMDb credentials for confirmation). Now if that's not putting your whole heart and soul to a love product, I don't know what is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bohemian storm is brewing!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge takes you back in the 19th century France,in Paris,in the worldwide known cabaret "Moulin Rouge". Moulin Rouge is the tale of a beautiful courtesan Satin the star of the cabaret, who falls in love with a young ambitious poet, Christian. But Satin wants to become a famous actress and if she wants to achieve this she has to be with the Duke,the man who produces the theatrical play in which she will star.So Satin will have to make a choice either to follow her dream and become a well known actress or let herself enjoy her romance with Christian.The movie is a fantastic dramatic musical directed by the visionary director Baz Lurhman.The cast is magnificent too, Nicole Kidman dazzles as Satin and her co-star Ewan McGregor is very charming (They both do their own singing in the movie). Let Moulin Rouge take you to another world, where you will be amazed by the set,the costumes,the bohemian world of Toulouse Lautrec(played by Jonh Leguizamo) and the music composed by Armstrong. Many famous performers sing for the soundtrack like Cgristina Aguilera, Pink,Missy Elliot, David Bowie, Beck and Bono.It is a wonderful movie, a spectacle for the eye. If you have not see it do it now and remember the greatest thing you will ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that I never saw this movie when it was in theaters but it was on demand last night so being bored i decided to order it and watch. It was brilliantly done but I can see where the negative reviews come from. The camera spins and created dizzying shots in which colors and shapes blend with pop songs such as Like a Virgin and Diamonds are a girls best friend. I would still suggest seeing it because I have seen nothing like it.....as some mentioned earlier it would probably be a good spring board for getting someone into musical film and theater. On a side note, I had no idea that Ewan McGregor could sing so well nor Nicole Kidman for that matter, they alone make it worth enduring the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Strange, But This Film Is, Well, Spectacular!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSIt's my 50th comment. I have decided to comment on Moulin Rouge! Now, I don't usually get into films like this, but when I saw this, I immediately loved it. Maybe because the film is so incredibly strange, or maybe because they actually have modern-day music in a film that takes place in 1899. I like classical music, don't get me wrong, but using modern-day music was a unique idea. Actually, the modern-day music sounds classical in this film. I actually had no idea that Nicole Kidman or Ewan McGregor could actually sing. This film taught me something.This film is about a man named Christian, a man who goes to Paris to write a story. But in Paris he is told to write a play called Spectacular Spectaular at the nightclub called the Moulin Rouge. There he meets Satine, a performer at Moulin Rouge. She also has a fatal disease. She thinks that she is the Duke. When she finds out that he is a poet with no money, she is baffled. Then he improves the play's plot, making it an Indian play. It use to take place in Switzerland. Christian and Satine fall in love. The real Duke likes the idea of the play. Then it turns out the real Duke wants Satine. He also wants to shut down the Moulin Rouge if he doesn't get her. When the Duke finds out that Christian is in love with Satine, he tries to kill him. Satine pretends that she doesn't love Christain and tells him to leave town. To protect Christian. When the Indian show debuts, Satine plays her part wearily, realizing that she is dying. Christian comes back and the Duke tries to kill him with a gun. He is foiled by the Moulin Rouge manager Harold Zidler. Then Satine collapses. She dies in Christian's arms as he weeps. Before she dies she tells him to write a story about them. A year later he does.Overall, this is very strange film. Yet it is very good. It also has very good camera angles and montages. I don't think there is any film quite like this. The acting of course it very good. This is a spectacular throughout.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generally - I liked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Spectacular Spectacular - no words in the vernacular can describe this great event, you'll be dumb with wonderment". That line stuck with me for a few days, after watching this piece of artistry. Colorful, fast-paced, MTV video style motion picture that reminded me of Whose Line Is It Anyway Song titles game. The Like A Virgin sequence was modernly hilarious. True, it won't appeal to everyone, but there's actually a love story surfacing above the glitz and the glamour. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman both do a nice job of portraying the "doomed lovers", and they do a good job of singing too. I still think Kidman should have been nominated for "The Others", but Moulin Rouge just shows her range more for comedy, music and drama. Very exquisite. So some of the songs were after the Moulin Rouge time period, I sang along with it anyway. The movie is like a nightclub itself, fun and entertaining. Overall, an original concept and an unforgettable experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has to be a reason why this movie musical was shown twice on our local TV. I even watched it twice, though the second time never really watched from start to end. Given Nicole Kidman is one of my favourite celebrities, it's one of those reasons I watched it.Christian (Ewan McGregor) is a writer desperately searching ideas for his works till he was being thrust into writing a play, by accident. He went into Moulin Rouge and met some very interesting and colourful characters and people.Satine (Nicole Kidman) is the most famous courtesan at Moulin Rouge and many are stunned by how she looked. Though she is being engaged, she began a forbidden love story with Christian.The song and dance are a big draw to this movie musical and both Ewan and Nicole can actually sing well. 'Come What May' is just so touching which almost made me cry. I know.Watch it not because Nicole Kidman is in this movie musical (which I soon learned). Watch it because it is just so beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Chaos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that this movie was another Hollywood offering; another weepy love story that I'd discard from my head as soon as the final credits roll up.I was never more wrong.From the moment the opening credits were presented - for how else do you describe it? A little man conducting an invisible orchestra with so deep a passion that you cannot help think it as ridiculous, the sombre opening, then the sudden jolt when time line is reversed, back to where it all began. And scenes after scenes edited faster than you can catch them - you'd think this was some sort of bad cinematic decisions they had made in the cutting room.But this movie got away with it, because it was a perfect fit for the whole scenario: I've never seen anything like it before, and like a child looking at a new specimen, I stared and stared and tried to take it all in as much as I could. It was chaotic to the extreme. Whoopi Goldberg said it succinctly during the Acadamy Awards: "I guess Moulin Rouge! just directed itself." It was a compliment, because I cannot imagine how did Baz Luhrmann direct such a feast for the mind and soul without breaking the whole story.In short, this is the revival of musical in the grandest scale ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christian is a penniless writer who comes to Paris to write about love. The only problem is that he has never been in love! Due to some confusion, he ends up writing a play called "Spectacular Spectacular" and ends up falling in love with a prostitute named Satine. Now, Zidler makes a deal with The Duke that the Duke can have Satine all to himself as long as he turns the whorehouse into a theater. Satine and Christian hide their love from The Duke but it isn't easy and there are slips now and then.Satine is also sick with TB. While all this is going on, there is some of the most happy music going on. The songs are very lively and funny, especially the scene where Zidler and The Duke are doing the song, "like a virgin". I think that scene is the funniest in the whole movie because Zidler wears this cloth over his face and bats his eyelashes! There are a lot of funny parts and a lot of sad parts. The movie about forbidden love is spectacular, spectacular!</fullReview>

Now, on to this movie. I wanted to hate it so bad, it came out at the same time as the first LOTR so I was naturally pitted against it because of the Oscars. I went on hating this movie I had never seen for being a musical. and also for reworking old songs in a new way (I had caught glimpses of the movie walking through the living room while my sisters watched it). Finally i sat down to watch the thing on a lonely weeknight, and was just totally ripped from my hate of the premise and placed firmly in the seat of one who would decry all who disliked it. The film reeks of freshness, the style is so unlike so much trash that is out in Hollywood currently. Yet while it seems over the top when viewed in a snapshot, the film as a whole is magnificent. I wont try and describe all the elements that I loved, you can see them for yourself (youll have to watch it more than once to get everything, the first viewing is a lot of you getting used to the style). If an 18 year old, at the time, die-hard action nut and sci-fi nerd can like this musical;anyone should.</fullReview>

Ewan McGregor (Star Wars, Trainspotting) marvels and Nicole Kidman (Cold Mountain) sparkles in this entertaining, sad, romantic musical.Christian (McGregor) goes to the Moulin Rouge to write but falls in love with a beautiful Courtesan (Kidman) and the movie is about how they have to hide their love from people such as the enigmatic Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent: Bridget Jones' Diary) and the slimy Duke (Richard Roxburgh: Van Helsing). However, as all good love stories go she has to end it for their sake and then inevitably she dies.All songs performed by the stars in a movie that is truly legendary, and will be remembered forever.I love this movie and would recommend it to anyone who loves, romance but also to those who love music as this movie ingeniously uses modern musical number from people such as Sir Elton John and David Bowie, to Fatboy Slim and Xtina, making the movie so much more enjoyable.

		<fullReview>This is a true experience. I was halfway through the movie. I still didn't understand it, but I sat in its lush glow and vivacity. Baz Luhrmann threw together a mass of elements into a soup that will make some people hate it and others love it. For whatever reason, I walked out of the theater exhilarated. First, we have the love story. Satine and her young writer. We know it is doomed from the time she coughs into her handkerchief. Then there is the theatre. It's what we might see something like this in our dreams. Then there are the French painters, mugging and wandering through, stealing scenes. Through in some contemporary music mixed with music created for the film. It's a hodgepodge. I remember a story by Ray Bradbury where a Chinese emperor doesn't want to face reality. I believe it is called "The Flying Machine." He stairs at a mechanical toy with artificial birds and flowers. This is like one of those wondrous machines. I don't even know if we can form an emotional attachment for the characters because they are like dolls moving through the amazing numbers and visual delights. I remember trying to tell someone why I liked this, and by the time I finished, I could see that he would not go near this movie. And yet, for some of us, it reels us in and holds us to the very end. Go figure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The parallels between Moulin Rouge and Children of Paradise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two movies that sit near the top of my all-time list are "Moulin Rouge" and the French movie, "Children of Paradise". The parallels between the two movies are beyond coincidence."Children of Paradise" was released in 1946 after WWII as two movies made out of one, primarily because of its extreme length. It was made during the Nazi occupation in France in 1945, and was set on the Boulevard of Crime in Paris, in 1820. Many of the actors were Nazi collaborators, because the Germans were oversaw the production of the movie. The French who made the movie were mostly unfriendly to the Germans so many of the actors were also members of the resistance.The two main characters, like the two main characters in "Moulin Rouge", include a timid, shy artist, Baptiste, and a prostitute, Garance. She becomes an actress by the direct influence of the shy artist. As the movie develops the courtesan ends up as a courtesan to a Duke, even though she is in love with the shy artist.Finally Garance rejects the Duke, in this case many years later, and goes back to the artist. They finally consummate their love, but then are tragically torn apart, once more.As with Satine in "Moulin Rouge", at least two other men are in love with the courtesan, Garance, and have their lives dramatically changed because of their attraction and commitment to her. Arletty, the actress who played Garance, was banned from French cinema for 10 years after the war because she was judged a Nazi collaborator. She had a relationship with a Nazi Colonel during the war. While the plots of the two movies a not exactly the same, the flavor of the movies are particularly similar. Both are set in front of and behind the stage. The action within the scenes in both movies is complex and diverse, as in a non-stop carnival. Dancers and acrobats, aristocrats and beggars fill the stages of both movies in wild celebration. Beneath the surface, within the story lines, deceit and jealousy are played with a richness seldom seen in film.Truth, beauty, freedom and love are questioned and examined, and finally, perhaps, found to be fleeting, at best.The children of Paradise lived 79 years before the children of the Revolution, yet they lived in the same place, lived the life of the theater and suffered the same agony of love. "Children of Paradise" is considered by many as the best film ever made in France. In 1947 it was nominated for "Best Writing, Original Screenplay" by the Acedamy Awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie too good for words!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love is not a strong enough word for how I feel about this movie! In fact, I don't think that there is a word for how much I adore this movie! I can watch it over and over and never tire of it! I make all of my friends watch it, I even made my older brother watch it! And they've all liked it a lot. Even if you HATE chick flicks, musicals, or movies that contain prostitutes, watch it. I think you'll be surprised at what a wonderful film it is! It's a work of art! A beautiful love story, a charming comedy, and a ground breaking musical! It provides universal appeal. I completely loved Ewan McGregor in it! He was just SO adorable! And I didn't like Nicole Kidman AT ALL before I saw this movie. I wouldn't say that I'm now her biggest fan, but I like her much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. That is my general opinion of this movie. I thought it was absolutely wonderful! It is beautiful and artistic! The costumes, music, storyline, and actors are beautiful. I loved every aspect of this movie! It was great. I love the passion and how it can make a person laugh at the same time! Nicole Kidman is an astonishing actress! She definitely brings beauty and life to the movie!! I really like how part of the storyline is almost silently revealed at the beginning of the movie. It is so very sad, and it makes me cry every time I watch it. Satine's death is so very sad!It truly is a powerful movie and it deserves to be highlighted by those who love, like, and maybe even adore it! Once again, I say that Nicole Kidman is wonderful in this movie, and she and Ewan McGregor have wonderful chemistry throughout the entire story. All the songs have wonderful placement in the film, and I absolutely adore "Come What May." It's a beautiful song, and it represents everything that everyone hopes for in life and in love. So...if anyone who hasn't seen this movie is reading this, I recommend this movie with every fiber of my being!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>moulin rouge seems to be a movie that fiercely divides people...although i am not a great fan of musicals, moulin rouge manages to force feed you absinthe and drag you through the streets of Paris that never were... yes, it is not a deep movie... the performances are over the top... that is baz luhrman's modus operandi.. this movie establishes its agenda early and does not apologise for it... it is a sumptuous honey drowning visual romp...the use of modern songs is, in my opinion, brilliant ... i've read lots of comments vilifying the movie for its incorporation of modern pop culture, and to those people i'd like to say: 1) contemporary pop music has some good, witty lyrics (admittedly not everything in MR fits the bill)... no less than many older, "classic" musicals...2) all genres adapt... just because this is "not done" in musicals, according to some arbitrary panel of experts, doesn't mean anything... it's been done now, and it is a post modern film... that's what it set out to be, and importantly, it pulled it off... it may not work in every movie, but the skill of the director has made the difference...3) i'm not going to pretend that hearing "smells like teen spirit" mangled didn't hurt, but as used in the film, it fits the context and is a justifiable choice... i'll deal with it...4) if some people would be objective, they would concede that the arrangements in MR show that popular music translates easily into the light opera setting, with the correct treatment...5) this is a possible springboard to convert people who don't like musicals...now, the editing and camera-work is frenetic, but it displays a sense of style completely unique to the director... people compare this to music videos, but apart from the speed and energy, i don't see it... luhrman may use common elements but he does impart his own sensibilities... the music video business is categorised by how similar all the products are (and some music videos do break the mould and provide exceptional visuals anyway)...the sets and costumes are magical... there is no denying it... jim broadbent is superb, and those who say mcgregor can't sing are just fools, or bitter...if you accept that just about nothing is original (certainly not the churned out musicals of the early days of Hollywood, that quickly established stereotypes and parameters that are still being used by bollywood) and that post modern works can be valid, vital entertainment, then you will accept that moulin rouge is wildly enjoyable... it is a slight movie in some respects, but there are flashes of gravity amidst all the noise, fervour and pomp...i think baz luhrman has pushed the genre of screen musical forward (kicking and screaming), and this is commendable... i think he has even prophesied the backlash in an earlier movie (the brilliant "strictly ballroom") which had the dancer hero chastised for "flashy, new steps"... the light musical has often been a platform for light, sparkling entertainment, and a little injection of flash can be easily dismissed by purists... but those adventurous viewers in pursuit of a good time will find it, come what may...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This romantic, musical drama is about a struggling writer (Ewan McGregor) who falls for a beautiful night club courtesan (Nicole Kidman) whom an insanely jealous duke (Richard Roxburgh) covets in 1899's Paris.This musical love story take place in the early 20th century in France. Basically, this story is about four things: Beauty, Freedom, Truth, and above all things, LOVE! The movie is packed with some music such as "Lady Mamalade" (sung by Christina Aguilera, Mya, Missy Elliot, Pink, &amp; Lil Kim), "Nature Boy" (written by David Bowie), "Your Song" (written by Elton John), and many more so exciting and so delighting songs that we may be familiar of. Baz Luhrmann (director of Romeo + Juliet) did a great job directing this masterpiece. Well done, Baz! I'm impressed! The actors impressed me with their outstanding work in the film. I am especially impressed by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor's acting. Boy, they both can sing too! Nicole (Bewitched, The Interpreter) portrays Satine, a beautiful courtesan of a French night club in Paris. Ewan (The Island, Down With Love) portrays Christian, a young struggling writer who falls in love with her after she unwittingly draws him into her seductive spell with her sexual powers. Their secret affair leads them to explosive consequences. I have always loved Ewan and Nicole's work and this is what I have got to say to them, "Ewan &amp; Nicole, you're doing great! Keep up the good work!" This film had great appearances from some supporting actors: John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent, and Richard Roxburgh. They all did a great job in the movie as well.Overall, this film is spectacular, spectacular. It's one of the many splendored things that you will watch over and over again. I enjoyed it and I am in LOVE with it and you can can too cause' it's "so exciting, you audience will stomp and cheer! so delighting, it'll run for fifty years!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christian...get over satine and love me!!!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i've had the soundtrack since it came out but being 10 wen it initially was in movies i didn't see it, finally seeing it i thought one thing-marry me Christian. this movie is a whirlwind of romance, love,longing, intrigue ,affairs, song, dance, colour and death. its amazing and has rekindled the popularity of the musical movie, i loved all the songs and fell in love with Christian's as soon as i saw his first flash back wen he sang those first notes "THE HILLS ARE ALIVE...". he's GORGEOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the romeo and Juliet style romance is gorgeous and her death @ the end was so sad! everyone cries, I love the way this movie can touch you with its passion and love but upset you because of the heart wrenching truths of satines 'job' yet entertain you from the twirling camera moves and bursts of colour and music and make you laugh at the sweet goofs it makes along the way. The beginning has the same style as William Shakespeare's Romeo+Julilet, like the prologue-the performance of nature boy has already told us the ending, that satine dies. the reason this hooks us and we don't just walk out of the cinema going "hmmm whatever i no what happens" its because we want to see HOW it happens!!!! i love how he goes on to this completely off the wall situation where "an unconscious Argentinian fell through my roof followed by a dwarf dressed as a nun" the appropriation of "the sound of music" was really clever and using Kylie for a tinkerbell-like hallucination was really cute. the whirlwind into the moulin rouge was interesting and metaphorical. The appearance of satine, sitting on this trapeze was very effective. it has a metaphorical sense saying "even though yes, i am a hooker, i am still above you men, because i am only a hooker cause men need hookers" it shows that no matter what, she is still above the pigs who pay for her. The most powerful scene is El Tango De Roxanne, it has so much energy and emotion that every1 is drawn to tears as Christian cries out "I LOVE YOU" as satine is nearly violated by the duke. The anger and jealousy of the Argentinian touches you as throughout the tango Nini is passed from man to man, all faceless men willing to pay. The Choreography of the tango-suddenly all the cancan girls and their boys joining and doing this powerful tango in their old time underwear is so touching and powerful and makes you stop and think about the lives of these people. Another of the most heart wrenching moments is when Christian, desperate to believe satines leaving him 4 something else, that she still loves him, and he screams for her outside the mouiln rouge and u see satine crying in the clouds. then he goes and tries to pay her and they stumble onto stage, satine sobbing and Christian trying 2 force money into satines hands. then as he walks off she stands up and starts singing come what may and you know even though she'll die, you still know that they will have some happy last moments. and as they sing this beautiful love song to each other with the bursts of music and colour on the stage ending in rose petals you just want to bawl your eyes out in happiness that a love like that actually exists. and as the curtain goes down, you know this is it-she's going to die now. But chirstian does what she asked him to-to tell their story and your left wth a satisfied feeling, and as the credits roll you relise your face is wet wih tears...</fullReview>

I saw this movie at least 35 times literally! Its my favorite movie of all time! Perfect actors and actresses for each character! simply extraordinary! I can quote anything from the movie. i know all the words to the songs. (the main songs) I'm so happy i saw this movie in the first place. My sister bought it and liked it (she thought it was OK) then i saw it when she was at a friends house, and it sounds so stupid, but it changed my life forever... this movie introduced me to Ewan McGregor and when i found out that him and one of my favorite actresses (Nicole Kidman) sang all there songs themselves. i was blown away! Even after I've seen it over 35 times, its still the best movie! i can watch it over and over and over again! and I'm never bored! I'm not saying that I'm the movies "bigest fan" or whatever, I'm just saying that i love it! In fact! ill watch it right now! see ya on the flip side! so my rating for this movie is a perfect 10!!! excellent forever and always.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tragic emotional film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was recently invited to a movie night at my friends house, and when I heard we were going to watch Moulin Rouge I was horrified."A musical?" I thought, "don't make me gag." But as I started watching the movie, I realized how tragic the story really was. After the initial laughter and dancing, I began to feel a stirring behind my eyes as I watched true love being played out in a heart-breaking manner.Ewan McGregor was spectacular in this film, bringing just the right amount of sensitivity to a very hard role to play. He managed to come off as both jealous and heart-broken when Satine goes to sleep with the Duke, which I find would be very hard to pull off.But the true star of this movie is undoubtedly Nicole Kidman as Satine. She is sultry yet vulnerable and innocent in her role, and she was the one that truly made me start to tear up. The expressions she went through as she learned she was dying were subtle yet so emotionally powerful.The only complaint I have about this film, is that they seem to love piling tragic incidents on top of one another without leaving us room for a breather.It goes from hide love, love is found out, love is killed off, love is regained, love is killed off again, love is regained again, love is killed off again, love is regained, and then finally to love is gone when Satine dies.It seems to go a bit too fast, but that doesn't hinder the story very much. The ending is still just as tragic and moving.I'd recommend this story to just about anyone...well, anyone but insensitive idiots with the emotional range of a spoon. :3</fullReview>

I love when in some of the music scenes it turns in to a kind of magical fantasy sorta thing. All the music in it is so addicting! I have the sound track and don't want to stop listening to it. Christine is so beautiful! And Satine is pretty... I wanted to be her. I love the ending scene! It is so beautifully done, as is the rest of the movie. They do the characters so well that you hate them, or love them, and the way the look helps a lot. The costumes were awesome, I liked all costumes, they really brought out the setting and time. It draws you in to the crazy time of Paris in the 1900's It make you laugh and cry, love it, I'd give it an 12 out of 10. must see, if you ask me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen Moulin Rouge yet, go and rent it. Moulin Rouge is, to say the least, perfect. It's haunting, leaving you with a lingering wish for the movie to continue on for eternity. Easily one of the best and most original movies of recent history, everyone will find something in Moulin Rouge that they can enjoy.Baz Luhrmann creates a spectacular experience for the audience. With the gorgeous storyline, amazing costumes and sets, wonderful music and flawless acting, this is one emotional ride that you get onto with the opening credits and than get off of at the ending credits. I can guarantee you that you will walk away from Moulin Rouge with some strong emotion in your chest. There are very few movies that are done exquisitely without flaws (such as To Kill a Mockingbird and The Godfather), and Moulin Rouge is one of them. Luhrmann does an amazing job of capturing the essence of the Moulin Rouge club and showing the audience the things that come with the glitz and sex and glamor.I've never been a big fan of Nicole Kidman, but she is amazing as Satine. And her voice is beautiful. However, I for one do not really feel that she really deserved the Oscar nomination she received. In my mind, that nomination should have been given to either Ewan McGregor or Jim Broadbent. Broadbent is so wonderful, entering into that happy middle ground where you don't know whether to love his character or despise him. However, the really wonderful performance is given by Ewan McGregor. His emotions are shown in perfect clarity and it is his performance that really shows off the emotions that Moulin Rouge is all about.Go out and rent Moulin Rouge and I can promise you that you won't regret it. If I could, I would give it better than a 10/10. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I rented Moulin Rouge I did not realize at all how much i would grow attached to this movie. It may not be to everyone's liking but people should give it a chance...I did and it really connected with me.First, the music and dance in this movie was absolutely mind blowing. It was stunning to see the actors and actresses dance and sing like they did. The dance numbers were shocking ,but in a good way. The dances are so unique and stunning to look at, I got lost in them!The chemistry between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman was a real treat because it is such a rare thing for two people to be perfect like this in a role. Their acting skills really stand out in this movie, when they are in a scene with each other you can tell what they are feeling by just looking in their eyes. The sound of their voices really surprised me. I had no idea Nicole Kidman had such a beautiful voice. When Ewan sings for the first time his voice is so powerful and beautiful you get lost in it. I love every minute of it when they sing to each other... i get so emotional. I cant stop watching Moulin Rouge...I find the love story so entrapping...it gets to me every time, especially the emotion Ewan puts into his role...or when he starts to cry at the end...I cry too. I cant get over his acting because it makes me feel like it is happening to me. Every time i watch this movie i cry...but i don't mind because it truly hold all the qualities of a great movie. I no some people don't like this movie at all...but for me at least it will ALWAYS be in my favorites collection---I cant stop watching it!My two favorite lines/ quotes from the movie: 1) "My gift is my song...and this ones for you" 2) "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love, and be loved in return"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by: Baz Luhrmann Written by: Baz Luhrmann &amp; Craig PearceThis is an excellent movie, with a DVD to match it. The performances by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are extremely excellent. The songs suit the movie well. The DVD has excellent picture quality, and impressive sound quality. There are many, many features. Recommended! The principal genre of the movie is musical, but also it is a great movie of romance and drama. Is the most romantic film ever.One of the best movies I've ever seen!Plot: A surprisingly love story take place A British poet moves to France and finds himself in a position to write a play for the Moulin Rouge. Soon thereafter, he falls in love with one of its stars, Satine. But the play and the Moulin Rouge will not go on unless a certain Duke invests his money into it.? The Duke is also in love with Satine and doesn't know about the secret love affair between the poet and Satine. Critique: Ewan McGregor turns is a terrific performance as Christian, the young man who arrives in Paris with nothing more than spirit and a head filled with ideas of love. I'm not a huge fan of musicals but this film is just so brilliantly written and the acting is superb. You cannot possibly absorb it all in one viewing. I think if you do not appreciate this movie, you're not a romantic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie: Moulin Rouge Rating: Rated PG-13 for sexual content Starring: Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman Summary: The story opens in 1900 in Paris. It seems the place is dull and dead, and eventually the camera introduces the weeping Ewan McGregor, where he goes to sit at his typewriter and thus begins the story of his late love, Satine.It all starts in 1899, where McGregor's character, Christian, comes to Paris hoping to be a part of the Bohemian revolution sweeping the world. He dreams of becoming a writer, and has almost an obsession to write a story about love but realizes that he's never been in love.Seconds later, we are introduced to Toulouse Lautrec (played by John Leguizamo), and a few other men trying to write a show for the famous nightclub, the Moulin Rouge, and after hearing Christian's wonderful work, they form a plan to pass Christian off as a famous writer to write for the show, and was to show his work to Satine, played by Nicole Kidman, the Sparking Diamond, courtesan of the Moulin Rouge. After she approved of it, she would tell Harold Zidler, the ruler of the Moulin Rouge so Christian could write the show.That night, the group sneak into the Moulin Rouge and there's an accidental mix-up with the meeting of Christian and Satine, and the Duke and Satine, and magically, both Satine and Christian fall in true love, and for the rest of the movie, try to always keep their love together, no matter how much conflict gets in their way by being a courtesan, the jealous Duke, and the show for the Moulin Rouge...Opinions: I don't want to spoil the ending and the conflicts in full detail but to say this movie is just a jewel is just an understatement. This movie directed by Baz Luherman, who also made his version of Romeo and Juliet with Romeo DiCaprio, has made another divine piece of work. This movie to note is a musical, and before I saw this movie, I never really cared much for a new taste in music, but after I saw the movie, I was astounded and fell in love with both Kidman's and McGregor's voices when they sang.The singing and choreography for the movie is close to perfect to set the mood of the movie, my most favorite the Roxanne Tango and the Elephant Love Medley. You can't find such imaginative movies like this these days.It's a fun, sad, suspenseful, and heart-breaking movie all in one. By the beginning of the movie, you feel you're going to have a fun time, and by the middle, you feel upset of all the conflicts invading the relationship with Kidman and McGregor, you can't help but nearly feel the same as they are on screen. By the end of the movie, you will become devastated of all that's happened, and by the end, you're be crying happy but soon sad tears. By the credits, you'll feel you've seen a pure love story about Beauty, Freedom, Truth, and above all things, Love! Total: 9.4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Rouge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Moulin Rouge!! I am a university student studying film and it is one of my all time favourites, along with Romeo &amp; Juliet (also by Baz Luhrmann) then there is Trainspotting, a classic, and Amores Perros and finally (It may be sad but I love its predictability) Scream. Many of you may think it's the saddest film ever but I don't care, I love it. Moulin Rouge is at the top of my list, the music, the colours, the actors, all of it, I have no complaints at all. Ewan McGregor has an amazing voice and is pretty yummy too. One of my favourite things is the Elephant Love Medley (yes I am that sad I have the soundtrack) it has so many songs in it that usually I wouldn't listen to but in Moulin Rouge, it works brilliantly. Also Exan McGregor's rendition of Your Song by Elton John is fabulous, absolutely fabulous. Moulin Rouge is a classic film, with many typical aspects of romantic films, with a twist that makes it even better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friend got me to watch this film and my first thought was that it was going to be rubbish.....but this film is the most fantastic film i have ever seen, pure genius! There is nothing in this film that i don't like. I enjoyed it from start to finish. Ewan Mcgregor and Nicole Kidman were excellent in this film. I don't think there could have been any other actor/actress who had such chemistry to star in this film. Also the songs are amazing. I didn't realise that both were such good singers, so was very impressed when i first watched it. Totally brilliant. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a little bit of comedy, drama and good songs. My number one film. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is and masterpiece by Baz Luhrmann, the Aussie directer that changed modern cinema. He's directed Romeo and Juliet, and Stricktly Ballroom, but Moulin Rouge is my personal favourite out of the 3, but it's my favourite movie so that's expected. Here's whyStarting with the visual aspects, the costumes are breathtaking, surpassing other movies by leagues. The set is equally fantastic. It's too awesome to put in words.Nicole Kidman is breathtaking as Satine, while Ewan McGregor gives a wonderful performance as Christian the love-struck poet. Both display amazing singing abilities, performing all their own songs, with only a singing coach to help them. Not bad for 2 actors.Ewan McGregor says it all "I really think it will just blow everyone away. It really is a feast for the senses" Couldn't have said it better...</fullReview>

Even if you're not a fan of musicals, I would recommend this film to you. I cannot imagine the roles of Satine and Christian being played by any other actors as they are both magnificent. Also, all the songs are sung by the actors themselves, which is even better! The way modern songs are used and put together, especially in Elephant Love Song Medley, is brilliant. This film has everything: romance, comedy, tragedy and music. I truly cannot say a bad word about it. Please please watch it, you will not be disappointed!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, this movie is one of the only who could get to me completely. I love Ewan and Nicole, they are both super talented, so that pretty much what drove me to watch the movie yesterday.=] I am saying right now, if you haven't watched this movie you must. I am hooked. The storyline alone was amazing, but to add songs to it, it made it spectacular! The mix of music and the passion between Satine and Christian made this movie so unpredictable. The passionate romance between the two leads was a beautiful thing, that did not seem like acting at all! Christian was an amazing idea of a hopeless romantic. He is funny &amp; is obsessed with love. I loved how the play inside the movie reflected him. Ewan is such a talented singer, so I say whoever made this cast is pure genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magic of Musicals brought back to the screen! Woo!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Moulin Rouge. Being a theater person, I love how the story and the feelings of love are communicated in song and fantastic dance numbers. It also had that classic playful feel about it like the old musicals of the 1950s had, with the cheesy grins to the camera and all. Plus the acting is so wonderful; making your heart float over clouds and then suddenly break. Every time I see this movie I cry, even though I know what it happens, it kills me every time. As a an admirer of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor and John Leguizamo, all this movie did was make me admire than even more, for taking such a risk with this movie...because people either love it or loathe it (which is so sad for them). This movie also made me realize what I want out of love...and thats to risk everything for it...ah, also the character Christian is just one of the many characters from movies I would love to have in my ideal man...(Noah from The Notebook and Seth from The O.C) being the other two sides! So yes, this movie is adorable and the songs are so catchy. Especially the Elephant Love Medoly - learn the lines to that song and you'll never go back, you'll be hooked on musicals (Check), hooked on love (Check) and definitely hooked on the Moulin Rouge (CHECK!!!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I din't see this film till very recently because I'm not a fan of musicals. But a friend convinced me to give it a chance and I'm real glad I did. The film is visually stunning. It feels as though you are watching everything happen within a big, richly decorated Christmas tree covered in fairy-lights :-) The music isn't originally written for the film, but who cares. The tracks that are used, their arrangement and blending with the screen visuals is absolutely fantastic. As for Kidman and McGregor, fair play to them. They can both sing and have really good voices. Anyway......great film, which is going to be right up you're street if you like sparkling visual feasts and good music. I wonder how many other people who thought they didn't like musicals watched this film and suddenly realised what they'd been missing......i know I did LOL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best way to describe to movie is visual splendor! "Moulin Rouge!" is a feast for the eyes and thanks to the use of music also for the ears!To be honest I didn't expected to like this movie as much as I did. I never have been really impressed with director's Baz Luhrmann style. I however love the way he directed this movie. I'm still not a fan of him but I can certainly appreciate his talent more now. He directed this movie with lots of visual splendor and a good pace but also with an eye for the more emotional scene's.The movie is well casted, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are terrific leading actors and a good screen duo and John Leguizamo, Richard Roxburgh and David Wenham are almost unrecognizable! The performances in the movie by the actors are top-class and Kidman and McGregor also are surprising good singing talents.I love the way they mixed the all well known music together and the way they made it blend with the images on the screen.As for the story itself, I found it all terribly predictable but still with the images and music put under it, it is a original movie experience. "Moulin Rouge!" certainly is an unique, one of a kind movie.See this movie at least once in your lifetime.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is tragic, but that is an integral part of the story. I think it is still a wonderful movie, and I'm not the type that likes sad movies. If you like love stories or musicals, and even if you don't, you should find time to sit down and watch the movie. Even though you can understand the movie without giving it your full attention, it would really be a shame to miss the visuals presented in the movie. From the first moment you see Christian sitting at his typewriter, there are subtleties that are present throughout the movie serving to raise the enjoyment of the viewer. One of the most visually stimulating scenes in the movie is the initial dance scene in which Christian first lays eyes on Satine, and most of the other scenes are just as gripping as that one. No matter what type of movie you like, this one is a must-see. The music, the dancing, the love interest, and the comedic undertones all combine to make this film a fantastic experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, this is one of those movies which are true Hollywood material. What's Catwoman or Elektra next to this? I understand that people don't like to see musicals, or that they don't like to see what appears to be a perfect love story, because they think that's not real. I mean, I think that's the reason because some people didn't like this movie. But anyway, this movie it's absolutely awesome, fabulous, and it has everything (director, story, actors, music, ...) just great. Let's begin with the director, Baz Luhrman. This man really knows how to tell a story in the big screen, we can see that in "Moulin Rouge". OK, some of the camera moves may be a little bit extravagant, but, let's face it, it couldn't be better. It adjusts perfectly to the movie! The story... Oh, the story... By the tag lines it seems like a true cliché. Love here, love there, and they always seem happy, so we think that's just one of those "and they lived happily ever after" stories, and that's why I think that this movie it's worth watching. I mean, it's a true love story, "a story about love overcoming every obstacles", but the end it's simply genial... We get so into the story that we really wish it has a perfect ending, but it doesn't. Some of the people who left the movie in the middle may think that the movie is rubbish, but that's because they didn't stick around until the end. Last but not least, the Actors. First, Ewan McGregor. That guy has a talent to sing AND to act. That's unusual in this days. I think he was extremely convincing in his role, because he allows us to see the despair of the lost of our love, and he shows us the life, the ideals and the bohemian Paris in a way that is worthy of an applause. Now, Nicole Kidman. Not as good as Ewan McGregor, but also convincing and very romantic. She also allows us to see the rules and the life of a french prostitute in the end of the 19th Century. Now, just a synopsis of this comment. I think that this movie is great, very well directed, with a good choice of actors and excellent adaptations of many musics. Very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge! offers beautiful and red haired Nicole Kidman, who makes men crazy, me included. It also offers Ewan McGregor, who according to some female spectators, is so cute that it makes you yell IEEK! It also offers bits from good rock music, which forms part of the dialogue as well. Moulin Rouge! appears to be stunning musical and visual experience - a quantitative spectacle in every aspect. It's a movie for people who like it as big.In artistic sense this movie is nothing less than a headache. You'll recognize favourite songs from past decades in a new context, but the overall effect resembles too much a TV-Shop commercial of some Greatest Hits of the 70's compilation. You hear only tiny bits from famous songs and just few complete numbers. That is not to say that Moulin Rouge! is bad viewing, on the contrary! It is an orgy of colours, sounds and contrasts - a vehicle of complete entertainment that will satiate you whether you like it or not. There is, and hopefully never will be, another musical like this. Moulin Rouge is so unique that if Baz Luhrmann ever attempts to create anything like this again, he should be put into jail. Go and get it, but be prepared to run away if you don't want to get over-satiated.</fullReview>

Shes pretty sad. ANYWAY! The best part(s) were the songs "You Make Her Feel Like A Virgin", and the composition of the play. Oh, the red room scene was pretty good too.

		<fullReview>I cannot believe how uplifting this film is. It contains love, music, drama and very talented leading man and woman. Ewan McGregor gives an excellent performance as the penniless writer and Nicole Kidman, well, she is one of the few actresses that can sing and act. Astounding music and acting makes us oblivious to the world around us. I have watched this film many times and it still manages to amaze me. A wonderful film which makes you wish you had this whirlwind romance.One for the girls but I don't see why guys won't either. If you are feeling depressed or worried, watch this film and the warm feeling of desire and feel-goodness will fill you as soon as they burst into song. And the sight of Ewan McGregor gives it that extra bit to look forward to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Moulin Rouge" is an amazing show of costumes, dancing, singing... little witty things you only see after two or three showings. Nicole Kidman is absolutely fabulous - who knew she could sing? Even if you find her annoying or stuck-up, Moulin Rouge gives her a totally different quality. Even if I never watch anything else of her's again, I will appreciate her role as Satine.Ewan McGregor is fabulous, and sings better than the majority of profession singers out there (his Scottish accent makes it better). McGregor, who is one of the world's best actors, in some admittedly unusual movies, sings, acts, and sobs like nothing you've seen before. No matter what you think of him, you owe it to yourself try this one out!Baz Luhrmann does a truly fantastic job on incorporating modern music into a classic piece; this should have won best picture, cinematography, sound, and costumes!The beginning makes you smile, the middle is a "feast for the eyes" (thank you, Ewan), and the ending will make you cry. Even if you don't think you'll like this one, "Moulin Rouge" is just too great to miss! I loved it, and almost everyone will!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a stunning musical worthy of remembrance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>what can I say? I had avoided Moulin Rouge at the cinema like the plague, turned off by musicals full stop. Then when it appeared on video I avoided it again. It was last year when it was shown on television and I was absolutely blown away by it. A stunning movie full of heart felt emotion and beautifully adapted songs, it was such a brilliant experience watching it for the first time. From the moment Ewan Mcgregor started his rendition of YOUR SONG I knew I loved this film.Performance wise this film hits the mark. Being a musical, the actors don't take their roles too seriously, an example the cast of Phantom of the Opera 2004 could have learned from. Mcgregor is superb as the penniless writer who falls for the girl he can't have. When he sings YOUR SONG and his face lights up who admits that they weren't moved? His voice never falters, and he has such a magnetic screen presence coupled with an easy going personality that it is a small wonder that h ended up being cast in a role few people would have fought for him to play in the beginning. Kidman is good as well, playing her tragic role easily and making sure her voice doesn't let her down either. The Duke is superbly played by Roxbrough, and he does enough to make you genuinely hate this sorry little man with a weasly voice and quite ridiculous moustache. Leguizamo, who I have never seen in another role is fine as Toulouse, and Broadbent is good value as zidler, with his hilarious rendition of LIKE A VIRGIN raising quite a few laughs. His serious face as he recites the words to the song is amusing, ad he has enough dramatic thrust to make the audience believe that while he has a theatre to care for, he is still concerned about his stars.The songs meanwhile are brilliantly realised. YOUR SONG is performed superbly by Mcgregor, and COME WHAT MAY is suitably uplifting when first done, and then again at the end. The other songs are done well as well, mixing old style music with recent hits to forge well thought out partnerships. But the best song is WE CAN BE LOVERS, mixing some of the best love songs ever written into one, starting with ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE and finishing with I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU. It also features the finest moment of the entire movie, as Mcgregor leaps to the top of the elephants head (Satines house) and sings out the famous song from the end of An Officer and a Gentleman WHERE EAGLES FLY. It is amazingly done, with the camera swooping past his delighted face as he belts out the words.Overall this is a magnificent achievement, and any faults such as choppy editing and the occasional camera wobble can be discarded.As they say, the show must go on!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is the best movie I've ever seen. It blends tantalizing visuals with a gripping plot. Nicole Kidman portrays her character perfectly. She surprises the audience with singing, comedy, and extreme drama. She gains the viewer's sympathy from her first scene and amazes with her captivating beauty. Ewan MacGregor is unbelievably charming and also is a surprisingly talented musician. The rest of the cast includes seasoned actors such as Jim Broadbent, John Leguizamo, and Richard Roxberg. The characters are eccentric and memorable,they range from immensely comedic to tragic. Luhrmann created a quality love story in the spectacular bohemian world of Paris at the turn of the century. Old songs are given new light and morphed into poignant musical dialogue that would otherwise be far too simple. The constant criticism of the movie as being just a series of reckless clichés completely overlooks the fundamental purpose of the film: effectively acounting for all of the conventional and unconventional views on love and art and culminating them into a deeply moving story. Having seen both Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliet, it is of my personal opinion that Moulin Rouge takes the best qualities and doubles their effect. It is the originality of the movie that clings to the viewer long after the credits. Luhrmann and the all the cast should be applauded for their bold move to enter a genre that had long been considered out-dated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People have to be incredibly careful with this movie. If the make the mistake of taking this movie too seriously, and not accepting it as the innocent, romantic, incredibly overblown, over-exaggerated, over-everything that it is, they will be greatly disappointed. Yes it is one cliché-after another. Yes it is over-done almost to the point of distraction. But in a movie like this, the simple things really shine. And it is the simple things that people miss in a lot of large blockbusters. The chemistry between the stars for one. Sheer emotional talent. And God the singing, in any other movie the surprisingly superb vocals of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor (who ever guessed Obi-Wan could sing??) would be buried under subplots, and subtleties, and action, and randomly interspersed cameos of huge stars, and bad acting, and everything else the movie industry throws at you to attempt to get you to sit through the movie and give them money. But in a movie like this, a movie that only has the emotion to rely on, the vocals can shine. And God did the shine. Looked at the right light, this movie is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A love story like every other which is like no other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think what I said above just about sums Moulin Rouge! perfectly. It is a love story like every other love story, but it is like no other love story.A paradox? Maybe, but that's exactly what this movie is.Firstly, let me just say that to fully enjoy this movie, you have to have an open mind. Forget reality and forget conventions. Moulin Rouge! isn't about reality and is as unconventional a movie as can be. Stop trying to "understand" it, and eventually, you will understand it. Secondly, you must be warned that it's a love-it-or-hate-it kinda movie. You're either a huge fan of the movie and have everything from the 2-disc special edition DVD to your own MR! t-shirt, or you hate it so much that you just want to point a gun to the character's heads. Don't listen to everything critics say. They are most likely the ones who hate this movie, as they spend a whole lifetime trying to "understand" movies, and when one like this comes along, they don't know what to do with it. They give it 0/10 before even giving it a second chance. A typical case of prejudice. You are not them, and so you at least owe it to yourself to give this movie a try.Now, let's talk about the actual movie. Moulin Rouge! is simply everything a movie should be. It has comedy. It has action. It has romance. It has drama. It has every filming style imaginable, from Disney to Bollywood. It is old vs. modern. I mean, which other movie has beautiful computer visual effects (some of which are reported to be the longest in movie history!) yet also has the old "hand-made" style of film-making, with unusual (and even wobbly) camera angles, on purpose? Which other movie has men in top hats singing Nirvana and beautiful courtesans singing Randy Crawford songs?The plot in itself is a run-of-the-mill love story, taken from the operas "La Boheme" and "La Traviata", taken from Dumas' "La Dame aux Caméllias". Christian (Ewan McGregor) is a young, middle-class writer who wants something new in life. He wants to write a brilliant novel with a beautiful love story at the heart of it. The only problem is... he has never been in love. Stuck in a rut in London with his overly-religious father, he decides to move away to Paris, the city of love, to become part of the Bohemian revolution. After an accident involving a Narcolpetic Argentinian, a very sweet and apologetic Toulouse Lautrec (John Leguizamo) and a falling roof, he meets a group of kind-hearted Bohemians who believe he is the one to help them write a show they are currently in the process of. The show is extremely important to them because it is a show all about their ideals of Truth, Beauty, Freedom and Love. However, they have other plans for it: they want to show it to the new financier of the Moulin Rouge, a Duke (Richard Roxburgh), whom they hope will agree to fund the conversion of the famous nightclub into a theatre. Now with a new writer for the show, the Bohos need a star for it. They immediately think of the Moulin Rouge's beautiful, top courtesan Satine. Before he can say "The hills are alive with the sound of music", Christian is off to the Moulin Rouge to convince Satine to be in the show. He sees her performing her rendition of "Diamonds are a girl's best friend" and is immediately head over heels in love with her. The only problem is, Satine is needed elsewhere. At the same time, on a table nearby, the Duke is waiting for Satine to finish her show. However, the Bohos had told Christian that Satine would meet with HIM after the show... and you can guess what happens next... yep, you've got it... Satine mistakes Christian for the Duke! Alone in her boudoir with Christian, inside an Elephant, Satine tries flat out to seduce this Duke who is actually Christian. Christian's Orphean soul makes Satine fall in love with him as he sings his own rendition of "Your Song". However, after finding out that he is in fact NOT the Duke, Satine tries to take back all the feelings she had. However, true love is not like that, and before you know it, they're kissing passionately on top of the Elephant. Another thing about true love is that it's unmistakable to miss, and before long, everyone else at the Moulin Rouge finds out about Christian and Satine's affair... apart from the Duke. To keep the Duke out of the know, Satine still has to seduce him and the night comes when she has to sleep with him... but she can't do it as she cares too much about Christian, and then it builds into a heart-wrenching climax... you'll have to watch the movie to see what I mean!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the best movie ever! I don't think I've ever seen anything like it. The whole story is so wonderful, and somebody may see this movie only as a cliché, but I think it's brilliant! It's Supposed to be a story about love, so well...I think Baz did a very nice job ;o) He also did a great job when casting the movie. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman were the perfect choices for this movie. They did a great job, and I guess I'm not the only one who had a huge crush on Ewan after seeing this movie. He's such a great actor and he has a lot of emotion to share with the audience who watches this movie. And not only is he a great actor, but he can sing as well! He has a beautiful voice which made me melt every time I heard him sing. Nicole Kidman did a great job as well. She has a lovely voice, and proves she can sing as well. She was perfect for the role as Satine and Ewan was perfect for the role as Christian. I also think Richard Roxburgh did a great job as the Duke. As I said, great actors! This is really a movie which is worth watching. Truly the best movie I've ever seen! You don't have to be a true musical-fan to like this movie, because it's just something about it which makes it awesome, musical-fan or not. See this movie, you won't regret! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant cinematic masterpiece. Director Baz Luhrmann is a genius!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie of all time. It's clever, different and visually stunning. The idea of using modern songs in a 19th century musical may sound like an awful idea, but it turns out beautifully, because the songs are modified to the actor singing them. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor give some of their best performances in this film, as well as showing off their incredible musical talents. This is a movie you can watch over and over again without it ever getting old. It shows the time period like we've never seen it before and tells a romantic story through the famous Moulin Rouge nightclub. In my opinion it's one of the most romantic films ever and will forever hold a place in cinematic history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie I Have Ever Seen!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is perfect. That really is the best thing I can think of to describe this film. The songs are incredible, and nobody could sing them better than Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor.Nicole Kidman is absolutely amazing in this movie She and Ewen McGreggor create the kind of lovers that have not been seen since...well..ever. They have a kind of chemistry that is one-in-a-million. I absolutely love the story. I cannot believe that it hasn't gotten the kind of attention it deserves. Whoever wrote the storyline for this movie is a genius. I have never cried so hard in my entire life. Or laughed so hard either. Richard Roxburgh is excellent as the duke. He and Jim Broadbent are hilarious when they sing 'Like A Virgin'. This movie is incredible, and I've seen it thirty times. It never gets old. I laugh just as hard, I cry just as hard, and I love it just as much as I did when I saw it for the very first time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a incredible film, with such staggeringly perfect script. A wonderful story line that would make ANYONE upset, great performances by Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman and Jim Broadbent.It has everything going for it, the music is sensational the directing superb! The story of a forbidden romance that is in the end united than stricken with doubt then collapses with the death of Nicole's character.This is no doubt one of the most magnificent films of era and should have been showered with Oscar's and Golden Globe's. This is a great film and should be recognized for the accomplishment as a grand film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story is one of the best I've ever seen. Everything is wonderful: the actors and actresses, the extras, the songs, the colors... Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are great artists, they can act and sing very well, and they are a magic couple on stage. Besides that, it's such a complete film, it's a musical, a comedy, a drama and a romantic movie, and both leading and supporting actors make it all work.When I first saw Moulin Rouge, I wondered if I could have a life like that, full of emotions and dreams, and if I could fall in love in such a romantic way. And I'm not getting tired of watching it again every time I can.So if you like dreaming, and you believe that love can change everything, you'll be glad to watch one of the best movies Hollywood has produced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the music in this movie... When Christian, Satie, the Doctor, Satine, Toulouse and Zidler are singing the pitch of the play,it is SO hilarious. The Elephant Love Medley is awesome as well as Come What May are awesome. Ewan and Nicole have such loving stage presence and work well together it seems. Their voices are amazing.. I sing along with all the songs and also say the dialog along with the movie. I haven't memorized the whole movie, but I'm close to doing it. That's a bit sad, but I just like the movie so much. I would just have to say that I give the songs as well as the acting a 10 out of 10. I would have to say another song that is funny is Like A Virgin sung by Richard Roxburgh and Jim Broadbent. The Duke really can't sing until the end of the song when he's belting out "Like A Virgin" LOL I recommend this movie to all those who haven't seen it. It gives a whole new spin on the idea of musicals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw Moulin Rouge for the first time...yes, I am a bit slow getting around to watch the films. Anyway, this one was hard to categorized for me. I liked it but at the same time I didn't. The costumes and colors are very awesome. The plot seems to run a bit fast and if you don't pay close attention you will miss something, although the actual plot is not that hard to follow(Duke wants girl, girl wants penniless artist/writer,Duke gets insanely jealous but doesn't win in the end.) I had seen some ads for it years ago when it first opened up, but as I said before never got around to seeing it. I thought, well, Toulouse Lautrec frequented Montmartre' and the Moulin Rouge, but surely they won't be so brazen as to put him in a fictional love story, conveniently titled M. R..... but there he is! Of course I have no idea if he was that 'hyper'?is that the word I'm looking for? or what in real life (I wasn't there! ;) ) but they portrayed him as being very annoying. First time I can honestly say Toulouse Lautrec has gotten on my nerves. I really thought it was clever the way Sutine was thinking the guy was not actually wanting to read poetry to her, but to make love to her, and she was getting all raunchy. That was slightly erotic and hilarious at the same time. The guys peeking around the corner was a bit...cheesy at best. Also, I liked the elephant. I'd have that, and live in it if I could. I guess this is what they call a musical, and I don't particularly care for musicals, I know it's just a show and they ARE entertaining, but it just seems, again, cheesy and almost incomprehensible when everyone knows the lines and can all sing in perfect key and they all just met. Another thing that drove me around the twist was splices of todays music in something that was set in 1899...what the..?? &gt;opinionated!!!!&lt; ;)I would say, if you have a couple hours to spend, go for it. Not a must see for me, but if you like bright colors, costumes and makeup, this is good. That's about all the enjoyment it was for me, and the over riding theme of Nothing matters but love, I'm a big IL' softy when it comes to that. :p So those parts were good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Story About Beauty, Freedom, Truth, and Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love a lot of musicals and I have to say that Moulin Rouge is one of my favorites. Baz Luhrmann, director of "Strictly Ballroom" and "Romeo &amp; Juliet" directed this 2001 hit. The movie has extraordinary sets and dazzling costumes, not to mention the brilliant performances by Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman, and the rest of the all-star cast. The music in the film is mostly from the 20th century; unlike the story, which takes place in 1899. Here are a few of the songs and their original performers. "Your Song" ? Elton John, "Like a Virgin" ? Madonna, "Roxanne" ? Sting, "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend" ? Marilyn Monroe, and "Nature Boy" ? Nat King Cole. It also has one new song that was created for the movie. "Come What May" is probably my favorite out of all the songs. Not only is it an original, it is inspiring and tells the true story of the love between the two characters. One song in the film is quite different from its original performance. This is "Your Song," originally sung by Elton John but performed by Ewan McGregor in the film. The beginning of the song actually starts out as poetry. He then breaks out into song right at "My gift is my song." It really catches your attention because he sings very fortissimo. John's version is a lot mellower and it moves a little smoother. The key stays the same in both versions, but the notes differ from time to time. It's quite different (the film's version) but it's a really well done rendition of "Your Song." It's one of my favorite songs in the film!As mentioned earlier, the costumes are dazzling! Each costume helps to portray that character and their personality. The characters that are morbid and mysterious wore darker colors, unlike some of the exuberant characters that wore bright colors. The dresses are extraordinarily beautiful, each being very colorful and unique. The other costumes in the movie are great too! They are all very detailed, especially Nicole Kidman's dresses and outfits which had sequins, gems, and loads of other decor. The dancing/choreography in this movie is astonishing! Every dance routine is unique and very detailed. It helps the story develop better and gives the viewer some idea of what the characters are feeling. One that comes to mind is the "El Tango De Roxanne" dance sequence. As the story unfolds, the characters portray it in their dance. They use sharp, crisp movements throughout the piece to exaggerate certain lines. If the song gets hectic, so does the dance. If it's slow and mysterious, the dance is too.The plot is quite common as with most love stories. You know: boy meets girl, girl plays hard-to-get, another man wants girl, girl finally likes boy, they fall in love, other guy gets in the way of things, girl finally finds her way back to original boy, etc. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is a penniless poet who has traveled from London to France. He befriends a group of Bohemians, one of whom is Toulouse Lautrec (John Leguizamo). He also meets the woman of his dreams, Satine, a courtesan and star performer at the Moulin Rouge. Christian composes a play called "Spectacular, Spectacular" that ends up being pretty much about his experience in France. The Duke (Richard Roxburgh) wants Satine for himself and will do anything to get her, even if it means killing Christian. The two lovers always seem to outsmart the dimwitted Duke until they are finally found out. The story follows the two characters in their magical journey about beauty, freedom, truth, and above all things, love.I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes musicals or even a good love story every now and then. It's a truly inspiring film with a lot of emotional ups and downs. The performances by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are outstanding! They really seem to have good chemistry, which makes the story more believable. Their voices also add to the fun and excitement of the film. The rest of the cast, including Jim Broadbent, Richard Roxburgh, and John Leguizamo are extraordinary also.</fullReview>

I guess I should thank Baz Luhrmann for changing my life (I mean it!). And everybody else of course that I didn't write whose name. But most of all the actors. Nicole and Ewan are spectacular spectacular. They are the best movie couple I've ever seen. Perfect with their singing and kissing and crying and everything... I can't find the right words. I can't tell you how this movie made me feel - and makes me feel after watching over 100 times. If anyone tells you it's rubbish send them to me - so I can exterminate them - and see it. And if you get to see any person who had been involved with it - or if you are one of them!!!!!!!!! - thank them. This story is about freedom, beauty, truth but above all things LOVE...</fullReview>

Nicole Kidman is absolutely stunning as Satine, red hair suits her so much, she was very sexy. Ewan McGregor looked pretty fine too, and Nicole and Ewan really made me believe that they were in love. It was a bit of a culture shock after I watched it and I realised they weren't together! The sets and the special effects were very, very realistic, I think this might be the most brilliant musical of all time!

Nicole Kidman and MacGregor work excellently together as the Aussies. The set, itself, which is entirely inside a huge warehouse is great . This includes the big elephant and the dance hall.Although I must admit that you need 2 or 3 viewings to actually get what is happening and all the flashbacks that do occur! - As in the beginning it is sometimes hard to recognise that MacGregor is the man typing on the typewriter!10/10 - A must see by everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand how anyone could hate this movie! It is my favorite movie of all time. Admittedly, the plot is cliché, but no one can claim that the plot keeps the movie from being unique. I have never seen anything remotely similar to Moulin Rouge. It is an incredible feast for your eyes; the set and costumes have such vibrant color that if they were the only good thing about the movie, you would still be entertained. The script is wacky and amusing, but also sentimental and moving. The acting was real; my heart broke for Christian every time he was jealous or hurt, because the pain on his face was real. Ewan McGregor is a phenomenal actor, and has the most pleasing male voice I have ever heard. Nicole Kidman is also superb, both as an actress and a singer. The movie moves quickly, but is easy to follow as long as you pay attention, and certainly keeps you from being bored. The songs, though familiar modern tunes, are blended and arranged in an original way, that could not be conceived by anyone other than a genius. Moulin Rouge never fails to excite, amuse, enthrall, or captivate me. I have seen it four times now, in the past 2 months, and have never managed to make it all the way through without crying. Despite the borrowed songs and cliché love story that drive the film, I have never seen a more original production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching "Moulin Rouge!" About 10 minutes into the movie, I had a fleeting thought about the movie. It reminded me of Alexandre Dumas's "La Dame aux Camelias", but that thought quickly left. Then again, later in the show, when Satine coughed blood into her napkin, I instantly recognized how this movie was a remake of "La Dame aux Camelias" Yeah, it had its deviations obviously, but the resemblance is completely unmistakable. I prefer Alexandre Dumas's story, but I liked the Baz Luhrman's presentation better.Gary Brunburgh, in his review of the movie prominently displayed on the review page said things like "Refreshingly Original" and "Satine could have easily been based on the life of the indelible French star Renee Adoree." I thought that I would give credit where it is due.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realizes what film can truly do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to sit here and give my personal opinion on things like acting quality, emotive reactions to the film, etc., because that ground has been trod into mud by other commenter's and boardcrawlers. All I wish to say here is that this movie is, to me, the realization of what the pioneers of film wished it to be. Think back to the Follies and the Gold Diggers shows of the 1920s. Though they were little more than filmed showing of stage productions, their influence upon Baz is readily evident in this film. And that's what he wanted.This movie, this trilogy (Simply Ballroom, Romeo+Juliet, and Moulin Rouge!, the Red Curtain Trilogy) is Baz's tribute to stage arts: Dance, Drama, and Music. In all three cases, he took pre-existing mediums of stage art and set them to his own, idiosyncratic tune before the camera. Flamenco was flamenco, Shakespeare was Shakespeare, and love ballads are love ballads here. This is why there is so little original musical material in this movie: it is a tribute. And, though I said I would keep my personal opinions out of this one, it's a 10/10 tribute in my eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read a number of reviews of this film and have to disagree with them on a number of points.It has been argued that the modern music/lyrics should'nt be in a film set in the early 1900s. However I think, IMO, that this is one of the strengths of the film. The music is excellent, even more so since it is out of context. It allows a modern audience, to appreciate the comedy and lyrical value of these songs. Admittedly some of these songs are not modern ' classics', but Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman do a good job. (though I still think that 'Somewhere Beyond the Sea' is the best MacGregor song on film, but that may be due to Carmen Diaz :) ) However this film is probably aimed at people who were young in the 80s and remember the music of the time.The film itself is a love story and, to be fair, a classical one at that (poor poet and unattainable woman), and is done pretty well. Nicole and Ewan make a nice couple and their acting is central to what makes this film worthwhile. However there is some classical moments for lovers strange covers of music, the 'Like a Virgin' cover by Jim Broadbent is great as is the 'Roxanne' cover.In essence,if you remember the music (late 80's/earlyt 90's) and like a good musical then this is one for you.I should also say that this is one of the most different (original) movies for a long time and allowed movies like Chicago to happen ( don't know if this is a good thing).Anyway this is just my opinion, watch the movie and make your own mind up, but I dare you not to hum some of the tunes the next day ;)..</fullReview>

With top-notch songs and a cast, it is one of the first big musicals in quite a long time. Starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. It is a classic love story taking place in the old Paris nightclub, the Moulin Rouge, where a group of people have experiences with love, jealousy, spite, death, and art. Moulin Rouge is one of the greatest musicals in a while now, but I don't like it as much as Chicago.Grade: 8/10MPAA Rating: PG-13My Rating: Ages 12 and up (sexuality, some violent content)</fullReview>

I watched Chicago first then Moulin Rouge and thought Chicago was clearly better at the time. I thought Moulin Rouge was too different and silly, and not really a REAL musical because a lot of the songs were not original. I then watched it again and the film grew on me. It really does take the viewer on a roller coaster ride of emotions from comedy, to romance, drama, and suspense. Nicole Kidman is absolutely excellent and deserved her Oscar nomination. Ewan McGregor also does a nice job. The DVD contains tons of extra information and is interactive. A very unique film that deserves several watchings to appreciate it fully.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The good and the bad of Moulin Rouge!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge! (2001) Directed by Baz Luhrmann, With Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, and Jim Broadbent.THE PLOT: A young poet named Christian (Ewan McGregor) comes to France to write a novel, and by a strange turn of events ends up coming to the Moulin Rouge to start a play. While at the Moulin Rouge, Christian falls deeply in love with a beautiful, but ill courtesan named Satine (Nicole Kidman).THE GOOD: Now, you probably shouldn't follow reviewers guidelines for this movie. It is a love it or hate it type, and you just have to decide for yourself whether you like it or not. As for me, I really enjoyed it. I thought the costumes and sets were all grand and beautiful. The acting is great, in my opinion. Everyone in the cast really surprised me with their singing abilities. Unlike other movies that would involve the themes in this film (by themes I am talking about sex and prostitutes), the movie does not end up feeling tasteless and tacky. If you're not a fan of Baz's typical fast-paced direction, don't give up within the first twenty minutes. It gets better after the beginning.THE BAD: Like I mentioned before, this is a love it or hate it type so I didn't find much bad within the film. If you can't stand musicals or the fact that the music is not original, steer clear of this movie. The soundtrack includes many popular songs from recent decades. The stars of the film sing them all so don't expect to be hearing the original versions of any of the songs used. **POTENTIAL SPOILER** If you dislike sad endings, this might not be the movie for you. **SPOILER OVER**MY RATING: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to the cinema with my partner to watch Moulin Rouge, I was not looking forward to it. To me it started off really weird and was tempted to leave within ten mins. but then the music kicked in and BAM! i was hooked. The music was sensational. Some of them were mixed with different love songs and strolled along beautifully. The more upbeat songs had the feet tapping to the beats.The movie was well coordinated with colour. It managed to set the right mood levels from glamour to sad scenes. Truly remarkable.The acting was of the highest calibre and some actually song the songs which helped blend then film together. It also had it's sad moments and it is advised to take some tissues in with you for the tearful persons.Owning this now on DVD, it has been played more than average and rightly so. A truly wonderful experience and a great musical which will live long in the history of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird, but lots of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When my girlfriend bought this on DVD I must admit to being less than impressed. There followed many weeks of "Shall we watch this tonight" to which I replied "I'm not really in the mood for it." To be honest, I was deathly afraid of being subjected to another musical after being scarred by Chicago. However, when the evening finally came that we sat down to watch Moulin Rouge, I was very pleasantly surprised.It has a style that is unique. It's weird and wacky and doesn't even pretend to contain anything like an original song. In fact the exact opposite is true as it it shamelessly borrows any song remotely relevant to the storyline. In fact, trying to spot all the song references let alone the songs themselves becomes quite a game.It's difficult to sum up Moulin Rouge. It's just fun, fast paced and never lets go of your interest for a moment. Initially, however, be prepared for a certain amount of confusion as your head (if it's anything like mine and was expecting a dreary Chicago-style dirge-fest) struggles to get a feel for the style and pace of the film. After that it's a thoroughly enjoyable ride right to the end. The simple plot has no surprises and you know what'll happen pretty much right from the start, but the story isn't what makes this movie entertaining. It's the music - a fact lost on the Chicago writers.Maybe I just like weird musicals but this one rates up there just behind Rocky Horror and Shop of Horrors on my list. Well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Great Cinematic Marvel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yea, after reading some of the recent comments, it's obvious that not everyone likes or gives this movie more than a passing glance then blows it off as rubbish or silly or nonsense. But then again I wouldn't want to watch what they consider a great cinematic masterpiece, which in my opinion, is exactly what this movie is! From the great scenery and costumes to the uplifting and inventive use of modern music in a bygone era of Paris circa 1900, this movie had it all.Sure, it took a little patience in the beginning because it went against what we are used to in movies. At first you are bombarded with music, dancing and sometimes bombastic dialouge but once it got to the actual story of a love that could not be, it was as good as any romance novel could hope for. It had Shakespearean elements of a tragic love story much in the style of Romeo and Juliet. Does Satine run off with the writer or marry the Duke(whom she despises) just to save the theatre and all it's actors who really are just a big group of misfits but family in every sense of the word. In those days, actors were not celebrities, like they are today, they were more like circus carneys or gypsies. Moulin Rouge, with all the twists and turns and pulling at the emotions of both lead actors, succeeds as the audience is drawn into their love story and feel every emotion as though it were their own! You fall in love with the leads and your heart aches for their doomed love. In the end, you feel the loss as deeply as anything you would feel in real life. I left the theatre in tears and i don't usually cry about anything! I say, watch it again and tell me if it isn't a powerful movie that ranks up thier with the best of what Hollywood has produced in the past 30 years or more! I could see Audrey Hepburn in the lead had this movie been shot in the 50's or early 60's and Marlon Brando or James Dean as the writer who falls madly in love with Satine. If you didn't like the movie, well I say your heart is hard and jaded and you are just plain boring!2 Thumbs Waaaaaaaaaaaay UP! I rank it as one of my top 5 favorites of all time and could watch Moulin Rouge every year for the rest of my life and love it like the first time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many viewers of this movie, it was all too odd and bizarre at first and overwhelming and I avoided watching it for nearly 2 years. I finally saw it in late 2002 and have now seen it 6 times and own the DVD. The music is amazing! I have become a huge Josh Groban fan(he actually sings the Ewon Mcgregors songs). He was 23 at the time. Like anything that becomes great, it is hard to swallow at first. Just like the Beatles when they changed thier style, people HATED it, but their later has become classic. People always want the safe and normal status qou when it comes to art and music. nothing out of the norm. But I say NORMAL is BORING! What is todays oddity becomes tomorrows masterpiece and ultimately stand the test of time. This movie, in my opinion, will be considered one of the great movies of our time and future generations will like it very much. Did you know that the public rejected "It's A Wonderful Life" at first? Hated it! But it has become a Christmas Classic that we watch every year like it was out first time seeing it. Same thing with "Rocky Horror Picture Show". Just consider ourselves( the ones who love it) to be ahead of our time because we got it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visually Breathtaking Experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge (2001) - 9.0 / 10It seemed that after the success of the 'Romeo + Juliet', Baz Luhrmann was destined for great things. However I'm not sure if anyone expected such a polished and visually breathtaking film. 'Moulin Rogue!' has something to offer everyone. Singing, dancing, fighting and some brilliant humour all combine almost perfectly to create a modern-day masterpiece.'Moulin Rouge!' follows the story of an aspiring young writer, Christian. In a random act of fate, he winds up writing the script for the latest bohemian play - Spectacular Spectacular. Using lyrics from popular songs and musicals, he creates an outstanding script. However, he needs funding for this play to go on - so he attempts to win over the gorgeous Satine in return for a chance to put on this play. As the story unfolds, Christian falls for Satine, which ultimately leads to disaster as The Duke has bought her rights and her hand in marriage.Ewan McGregor (Big Fish, Trainspotting) plays Christian in his best role to date. He delves into the character as if it was himself, making a very convincing bohemian writer. Nicole Kidman (Cold Mountain, The Others) plays the young courtesan Satine with stunning flair and brilliance. Her incredible voice lifts this entire film up a notch.Now don't let the mere fact that this is a musical throw you off! This is indeed one of the best musicals to date. The simple use of song instead of speech conveys Luhrmann messages on love to a higher degree.One of the best films of 2001. I have no idea why this isn't in the top 250 movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I thought McGregor and Kidman were excellent, as were Roxburgh and Leguizamo. The musical numbers were done quite well, and I found a good bit of humor in the usage of modern-day songs in the storyline. I appreciated this movie much more after the second and third viewings. Ewan McGregor does a more than credible job of carrying his role, and I wasn't aware he had such a piercing tenor. I was not put off by some of the camera work and visual imagery as some other reviewers - I found the frequently changing camera angles to be much more of a visual enhancement than a distraction, which added to the overall effect of the film.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard about Moulin Rouge from my friends and they all said it was good but I never really considered watching it. I had thought the movie wouldn't be my style and I wouldn't enjoy it. But then over the summer, I was really bored so I decided to give it a try, not really expecting anything. But literally within the first few minutes, I was already curious and interested. As the movie went on, I began to see why my friends liked it. It is a well-directed film with awesome scenery and visuals. I loved the music and I never knew that Nicole Kidman or Ewan McGregor could sing like that. It's an absolute must-see and it's definitely a favorite of mine!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My girlfriend introduced me to this film. The use of the musical numbers and the pure joy of just watching it reflects well. When watching this movie I go back to High School when we were producing My Fair Lady. We had standing ovations on every night. I never got tired of watching that show, I knew the lines as well as the actors, and it was a treat to watch. Moulin Rouge takes it's rightful place in my memories right beside it. I've seen Ewan McGregor's work obviously in Star Wars, and just seeing him belt out these awesome, awesome songs gives me get goosebumps. It's amazing what people can do when you least expect it. I had no premonitions when I sat down to watch this movie, and I was pleasantly surprised. My advice is the same, don't sit down and expect something that won't happen. Sit down and accept what Baz is trying to show you. I didn't even know he was the director until I came here to look the film up afterwards. I rarely give movies I watch a full star rating, but this one definitely gets it from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A colourful masterpiece, will be remembered forever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see this movie until about 2 years after it came out...I couldn't believe what I had been missing! While the starting of this movie is a bit "odd", once you get into it it's a colourful, musical, fun filled ride! Ewan McGregor plays an English immigrant writer named Christian. One day while writing, a midget named Toulouse and an unconscious Argentinean fall through his roof. Before you even have time to think Christian's hired to write a play that Toulouse (John Leguizamo) and the Argentinean will be in. First, though, Christian has to be approved by the beautiful courtesan, Satine (Nicole Kidman) (who works at the moulin rouge) and her production partner, Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent) who will be starring in the play. Well Christian and Satine end up falling in love but it's forbidden because Satine is supposed to be the Duke's (Richard Roxburgh) (who is paying to turn the Moulin Rouge into a theatre) "girl" exclusively. When Harold finds out that Christian and Satine are together he warns her to stay away from him. They don't listen and the Duke ends up finding out about them and threatens to kill Christian if he doesn't leave. All the while, Satine is dying from tuberculosis (unbeknownst to Christian and herself). When Harold tells Satine that the Duke will kill Christian if he doesn't leave, Satine and Christian plan on running away together. That plan is smashed when Harold informs Satine that she is dying. She is forced to push Christian away (though she doesn't tell him why, she just says she doesn't love him and that the Duke has more to offer). Christian breaks down and returns to the Moulin Rouge during the first showing of Spectacular Spectacular (the play he wrote). I've already told you enough so I won't tell you the ending (it's the best and most suspenseful part of the entire movie). It's a definite must see though, the story is perfectly put together and captures your attention right from the first 2 seconds of the movie...and the music and costumes are out of this world (I have both of the soundtracks, I'm addicted!). Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor do an amazing job ( I never knew they could sing either!). I wasn't a big fan of "musicals" before but Moulin Rouge converted me! You're missing out on A LOT if you don't see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The show must go on!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this film because I had always been very interested in all the films based on the life on the early 20s. Furthermore, I love musicals, so Moulin Rouge is one of my favourite films. The plot is not very original, I know, but it is a lovely love story. I guess that the most interesting details on the film are those that reflect the thinking and the lifestyle at that time. "The show must go on," one of the sentences that appears several times along the film, shows that pure ambition: although Satine may die at any moment, she must not know it, as there's not spectacle without Satine, there's no money without spectacle so, even risking her life, her boss is always exhorting her to go on working, because the show must go on. Another interesting aspect is what is called in the film "the Bohemian Revolution," and how rich people that go to the Moulin Rouge to get fun usually looks down on people that believe in the principles of this "Bohemian Revolution." The class struggle and the fact that money and politic power may change even the plot of the spectacle are a proof of the social inequality in the complex Paris of the early 20s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Rouge SPECTACULAR! SPECTACULAR!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantastic movie! Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor went out on a limb to do a musical version of Greta Garbo and Robert Taylor's CAMILLE. The movie is heavily based on the latter's love triangle (wealthy Baron, courtesan and poor lover), even down to Garbo's coughing spells and eventual death with her lover holding her in his arms. Even "I will love you till my dying day" dialogue. I was astounded how the "Christian" character used Robert Taylor's famous throwing francs at the ailing Garbo denouncing that his "summer of love" with Garbo was a joke, obviously hurt.Other than the similarities between the two flicks, Moulin Rouge takes it a step further with music. I was excited to hear music I grew up with throughout the movie. It made one stay tuned to the flick. It drags a bit with the "Like A Virgin" scene (nonsense).Other than that "Come What May" was original to the movie and very touching, especially near the end. I was very surprised to know that Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor did their own singing and did it well! Why they both didn't grab an Oscar I will never know. Acting is important. Dancing is important. Singing took it to another level. You have to prize people for being that talented in all three areas at one time.The movie is an extravaganza for the eyes and ears. Nicole Kidman is gorgeous and Ewan McGregor is fabulous in his role. They make the movie what it is.. It will become a "classic" before the decade is out. They will be written in history as the screen's best lovers. Their chemistry was "real" to the viewer. Maybe it is because they know each other personally as friends? Anyhoo I was glad to be able to view this flick and give it a double thumbs up.I recommend "Camille" as a "go along" with this movie. But I have to admit Moulin Rouge brings the old MGM classic to color and breathes more life into it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strange how one of the biggest things in Hollywood, namely the musical, has vanished the last decades as the recent years we only saw "Dancer in the dark" and "Chicago" making it big and of course this superb masterpiece from Baz Luhmann. Baz does something strange, he brings us back in the early 1900 namely in the decadent Paris at where we are invited to the strangest parties at Le Moulin Rouge. This is a musical that's never been done before, as even if we are hundred years back we hear modern popsongs (Bowie, Madonna, Nirvana) performed in a pure Broadwaystyle and it works splendid. It tells us the impossible story of a poor novelist who has to win a dancer Nicole Kidman who is destinated to sell her body, and for the sake of the Moulin Rouge she must marry the evil duke who put all his money in the cabaret. The cinematographic stills are amazing, so are the costumes and decors as this is indeed like you're in the middle of some decadent show. One of the most inspiring movies I recently saw and again an amazing Kidman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular!!!...A 'Modern Musical'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely LOVE this movie! And here's just a few reasons why...1.) The music/singing/dancing is GREAT... Though many people criticize this movies use of popular 'main-stream' music, I found it to be very interesting - and a bit different from 'the norm' - Not to mention comical at times!... The actors did a wonderful job with all the singing - (though am a bit biased on this subject as I know that I could probably never do something like that!)2.) The Storyline was good. Maybe a bit predictable at times (with the all-too-tragic ending...) But still very well done. Well written!3.) Visually appealing and stimulating. I consider this to be a very important quality in any film and 'Moulin Rouge!' with its vivid colors, CGI backgrounds and scenery, and authentic costumes and get ups certainly earned 'kudos' in my book...4.) Superb acting. ALL the actors in this film did a splendid job...Nicole Kidman - very stunning (as always) gave her charater an added spark that kept you interested... I can't really imagine anyone else in this role - she pulled it off so perfectly! Ewan McGreggor - Gorgeous (again, as always) I just LOVE his voice! I really liked his character - very endearing... John Leguizamo (please forgive any misspellings!) superb as Touluse! His character made me laugh SO MUCH!!! Okay, as you may have noticed I'm running out of adjectives to describe this awesome cast - So I think I'll just stop at that!5.) As I mentioned already the characters were just so rich and endearing - deffinitely a fact worth reiterating!6.) And last, but certainly not least, LOVE. This is such a 'hopeless romantic' movie (yes, if you're wondering, I am one!) with the whole "The greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return" thing resonating through the entire film - how could it not be?...So, as you can see, I highly rate this movie - it will forever be one of my favorites. I give it a 5/5 (never would have guessed that huh?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've found Baz Luhrmann's work to date somewhat self-indulgent. I know, one can't blame anyone for throwing their heart and soul into what turns them on. I've enjoyed his attempts at surreality, but hadn't liked his subject choices. I waited until `Moulin Rouge' came on to TV, expecting to hate it. Oh, was I wrong! I reckon I held my breath for the whole 2-3 hours, totally stunned by the audacity of this film. The story has a simple premise, but the sets, the costumes, the editing - oh, the fantastic editing - and Luhrmann's vision, from which this film was created, hit me like a giant truck! I loved the song-jokes, corny and obvious as they were. It was a pleasure to watch a film without a car chase, an act of sexual violence, an asteroid threatening life on earth, a drug bust.... The theatrical mood of this film obviously doesn't appeal to all, but it works for those who loved Saturday afternoon pantos, and musical theatre. All the cast were superb, but special mention must be made of the brilliant Jim Broadbent, who can do anything at all....... Also, I believed Richard Roxburgh's Duke held the whole film together, giving us one of his more evil performances - and Richard has played his fair share of villains. Can't wait to see Baz Luhrmann's next offering. Edward Albee on ice, perhaps?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is probably one of my favourite movies of all time. that isn't to say that everyone will love it as I do, of course... It is definately the type of movie that divides people into two classes: those who absolutely love, cherish, and adore it, and those who absolutely loathe, hate and despise it. count me into the former.To me, Baz luhrmann (the visionary, slightly mad director behind Romeo + Juliet) has created one of the rarest, most precious and beautiful gems of cinema, ever. The performances (a fizzling, sparkling cinematic pairing of the ever wonderful Ewan Mcgregor, and the heartbreaking, beautiful Nicole Kidman being the central ones), the sets, the costumes, the story, the themes, the music, and everything else that makes up this movie is sumptuous to the senses, overflowing with colour, emotion, energy, beauty and power. Luhrmann, who wrote the screenplay himself, along with Craig Pierce, (with whom he had already collaborated with on both his previous movies, Romeo + Juliet, and Strictly Ballroom) has admitted himself, that the movie is not aiming to be "psychologically thick". rather, it is a surreal, emotional journey, beautifully scripted, that aims not for realism, but "truth" of feeling. full of little gems (The scene inwhich Christian comes up with the refrain "the hills are alive with the sound of music" is a lovely example) and hundreds of truly show-stopping sequences, such as the incredibly intense "El tango de roxanne" scene, inwhich Christian's jealousy and anger towards his lover satine are brought to incredibly to the fore, through vigourous, erotic dancing, and swelling climax. Though this movie is notorious for it's MTV style quick cutting and fast paced, wild visuals and cinematography, I think it is infact not appreciated enough for what lends the film its heart and soul: the love story.The sequences set in the infamouse Moulin Rouge itself are, indeed, faced paced and exhilerating (perhaps to some, nauseating). however, Luhrmann steps up and down the pace of the camera. Even if at times it distracts some viewers with its restless, snappy cutting, it also becomes poetic and tender, if never quite stopping its' beautiously surreal movement and viewpoints. I've never been lifted higher out of my cinema seat than the joyeous scenes of the lovers duets "The elephant love medley" or "come what may". At points, the swelling emotion and magic is truly incredible, the emotional highs and lows the movie takes you on are truly amazing.This movie is a pulsating, touching, moving, funny, musical, tragic and wondrous work, that revolves around an age old theme: love, celebrating it and exciting all those whom it speaks, or perhaps sings to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was one of those people that didn't see the movie at the cinemas, instead I waited for a friend to have a copy so I could borrow it from them.I have only just watched Moulin Rouge! and I was told that I would either love it or hate it. At first, I didn't love it but I knew that I didn't hate it, so I watched it again the next day. I was more used to everything (including Kylie Minogue's 'Green Fairy' character, at first I was just like 'the point of her being there is ... ?, but now I understand it).Before I wrote this review, I read a few comments on the message boards, and one person said that they special effects were so unbelievable. That is the whole point of the movie - Luhrmann says in his commentary on the DVD that he wanted a world that was not perfect, but imperfect (as evidenced by Satine and Christian dancing on the clouds around the Eiffel Tower - honestly, how could anyone ever say that that scene was meant to be normal? The dancing on the clouds showed that 'love lifts us all, love is all we need'. Even Satine realised that after just listening to Christian singing once, and she was a courtisan of all people.)Ewan McGregor did a great job in the leading male role, I've never seen any other movie of his but I'm now a fan. I saw him in his Paris hotel at the start with his typewriter, and immediately loved him, even though I hadn't seen the rest of the movie. I loved it when he started singing, absolutely loved it. His singing won Satine over every time (the first time it stopped her heavy breathing and tiger sounds on the floor - that part I thought was hilarious - and when she tries to end things before her dinner with the Duke, when Christian suggests the 'secret song' so no matter how hard things got they would realise they loved each other.Overall, I thought the movie was well done. Over the top, perhaps, but that was meant to be the case. Luhrmann wanted it to be elaborate, colourful and high-energy. He and his crew most certainly achieved that, but I think the real shout outs should go to Nicole (in particular, after seeing this I really think she deserved the Oscar) and Ewan, because if there wasn't any chemistry between them, it would have been Gigli's predecessor.9.5/10 for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is one of my favorite movies of all time, honestly. It has a beautiful love story and is wonderful in every aspect. Luhrmann's work was fantastic, the colors and the way that he used recent pop music in a story that took place at the turn of the century was awesome. Also, I fell in love with Ewan McGregor in that movie. His acting as Christian and his love for Satine was completely believable. But, a lot of the credit also has to go out for Nicole Kidman who without the movie would probably not have been as good. As I previously mentioned, I loved the music and I thought that McGregor and Kidman did an absolute marvelous job singing them. I must admit though, that my favorite song is El Tango De Roxanne sung by 'The Unconscious Argentinean' (Jacek Koman). The only flaw that affected me in Moulin Rouge was the fact that Satine has consumption, or tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is a highly contagious disease and the fact that Christian was kissing her as she died and was still alive one year later bothered me a bit. On a whole though, I have to recommend this movie to everyone. If you're not a fan of love storys I'm sure you'll be able to enjoy the music and the color schemes! All in all .. I love it and I suggest that you go rent it/buy it today!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delirious candy box of music and romance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stylized. Kinetic. Hyperactive. These words are understatements when describing this film. The dream child of exacting and passionate director Luhrmann, it is a complete revitalization and rejuvenation of a long dead genre - the cinematic musical. Annoying nearly as many people as it captivated, it is a thoroughly unique film with unending movement, color and emotion, all wrapped in a startlingly plush production design. The story concerns McGregor, a naive young poet, who comes to turn-of-the-century Paris and becomes involved with the Bohemian lifestyle and ideals. He maneuvers his way into writing a stage spectacular for budding star (and courtesan) Kidman and winds up completely falling for her. Unfortunately, she is already spoken for by a sniveling, controlling Duke (Roxburgh) as arranged by her promoter/pimp (Broadbent.) McGregor fashions a stage show around the story he is actually living and the two worlds become intertwined with Kidman at the center of both. In a bold, but highly entertaining move, Lurhmann arranged for most of the music in the film to be contemporary pop sings filtered through an entirely new sensibility. This adds all new dimension and texture to songs that the audience is familiar with. The film begins in a wildly frenetic and jarring manner. Viewers who like this or who can hang on through this will likely find themselves enjoying the rest. Others may be put off and have a hard time accepting the unusual and decidedly different reality that this film lives in. Kidman broke away from her previous, somewhat middling career with this movie. She burst on to the scene in a whole new light and has never looked back. She is worshipped throughout by creative costuming, lighting, staging and especially by McGregor. As fine as she is, her performance would be somewhat dimmed if not for the amazing, heart-on-his-sleeve acting and singing of McGregor. He catapults off the cliff of emotional safety, completely exhibiting his adoration for Kidman and displaying a voice that is unusual, but exceedingly emotional and beautiful. The two make a stunning pair. It is inexplicable that McGregor was not nominated for an Oscar. There is strong support from Roxburgh and Broadbent and a host of odd little characters, though Leguizamo is an acquired taste. As the diminutive Toulouse-Lautrec, he is both affecting and annoying at the same time. The plot is pretty thin and predictable (as so many musical plots are!), but the sumptuous elements of the production and the invigorating singing, choreography and acting make it soar pretty high. This kicked the door open for other big screen musicals like "Chicago" and introduced a generation to a genre that had been ignored for decades.</fullReview>

It can either turned your whole life to be devoted to finding that special someone or to be careful about fallling in love (Satine's passing) The music and emotional colours bring a lot of emotion to the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film also has a great sense of humor, with green fairies, funny uses of familiar pop music, and lots of love &amp; emotion.It is extremely beautiful as well as tragic. I never thought I would hear an Elton John song again in a movie and they did the song better than Elton John did it himself. (Makes you wonder if Elton John ruined other songs of his by insisting he sing them himself.)But anyway this is my second FAVORITE movie of all time. My first being Betty Blue (37°2 le matin) which isn't out on DVD yet.Anywho this is a love story set in France at the Moulin Rouge, an infamous French dance hall (which was the first building in the world to have had electricity). It is an amazing story in itself to read about the Moulin Rouge and Toulouse-Latrec a french nobleman with birth defects who hung out at the Moulin Rouge quite a bit despite his fathers wishes. Toulouse-Latrec is known for his artistic posters, which he mostly drew at the Moulin Rouge. It almost seems as if the whole story is just a dream of Toulouse-Latrec's.The Moulin Rouge is the home of Satine (played by Nicole Kidman) who is a "consort". The young writer falls in love with her despite her profession and she falls in love with him despite the fact that he is broke. They have a "forbidden" love because of several factors and try unsuccessfully to escape their lives, to make a new life together.The scenery is all at the Moulin Rouge mostly and it is beautiful. There were also quite a few supporting actors and actresses who did a very good job. The costumes made this movie. I think without the sets and costumes this movie would NOT have been as good as it was. It seems to me that instead of heaping ALL the awards on Buz Luhrmann, they should have been heaping awards on his wife, who did the set! Also John Leguizamo was wonderful as Latrec, without Latrec this movie would be nothing. Nicole Kidman makes a convincing prostitute, because she is kind of cold and distant, as you would imagine a prostitute would be. And of course Ewan McGregor is really versatile and could probably play any part you gave him. There was some real chemistry going on with Satine and Ewan, possibly enough so that it broke up Nicole's marriage to Tom Cruise, who she is better of without anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful and Imaginative film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. Musicals have been undergoing a comeback since the release of two new musicals: Moulin Rouge and Chicago. Both these films were impressive musicals that I love. Musicals have never been my favorite genre but when they are well done, the time passes by very quickly. Both of those films qualify. Moulin Rouge could have something to do with Chicago's success. Yes, Moulin Rouge only gained around 50-60 million and Chicago gained over 100 million. But Moulin Rouge was nominated for a fair share of Oscars. It started the comeback and Chicago only made it more successful. Both films are quite different. Moulin Rouge is much more of a visual feast than Chicago, and what a feast this is. The sets are beautiful and imaginative. The costumes are flashy and stunning. In fact, this film is such a visual feast, that many could call it overkill. Did they over do it? Yes and at times some things seem a bit excessive. But Baz Luhrmann is known for this and he does not care. With the exception of one, the musical numbers all have magic to them. I did not much care for the "so exciting" number. Other than that the numbers are all great. The acting is mostly good. Nicole Kidman stunned me with this performance. Her voice was perfect and she did not stumble at all. She definitely deserved the oscar nomination. Ewan McGregor is the perfect match for her. They have great chemistry together and McGregor does a good job singing. Jim Broadbent also does an excellent job and was robbed of a nomination. Really, the only casting complaint I have is John Leguiziamo. He was terrible and irritating. Moulin Rouge is a very good film and definitelyy worth a look. It is a beautiful and magical experience. Unless you are put off by really fancy sets, which I do not think many are then watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the most difficult films I'll ever review because it is so amazingly spectacular! The work Baz put into this film is absolutely amazing and the result is something we've never seen or felt before. Through song and music, he is able to express our most basic yet essential emotions in ways words can't describe. The emotions expressed in the film are so beautiful and connecting to every one of us - it takes us to a place we've always had in our hearts and feel happiest at, but it's also a place we rarely ever get to experience in everyday life. Moulin Rouge fufills our desires and makes us realize there's more to people than just what we see. In a world so chaotic and violent as today, I look at this movie as almost essential to bringing us back to what matters most - love. Moulin Rouge most definitely takes us to the beauty 'love' and allows to fill the void we so often have trouble expressing. If you do want to be touched in a simple yet most beautiful way, please watch this movie and let your heart soar!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Rouge captures the essence of love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Moulin Rouge' illustrates that one of the most important things in life is to love and be loved. The movie is about a young man, Christian (Ewan McGregor) who travels to Paris to write about love. Soon there after, he meets the beautiful courtesan, Satine (Nicole Kidman). In a very Romeo and Juliet-like moment, they fall in love, but are pulled apart by outside forces. Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent), owner of the 'Moulin Rouge', tells Satine to make the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) believe she loves him so he'll invest in the 'Moulin Rouge'. She tries to play both sides, but of course it catches up to her and she's forced to make a choice. 'Moulin Rouge' is directed and co-written by Baz Luhrmann ('Romeo + Juliet') and he does anything but hold back on his creative style of filmmaking.In any movie, color plays a role in how a movie is detailed. In 'Moulin Rouge' certain colors stand out and seem to play their own part in the movie. The color red traditionally symbolizes love and death. The use of the color in this film is emphasizing the search of love for both Christian and Satine. It also foreshadows the inevitable death of Satine. Red is the first color the audience sees, when the curtain rises, and also the last color the audience sees, when the curtain closes. Throughout the movie, red is used elaborately in costumes and setting. The décor in both the elephant dressing room and the Moulin Rouge is mostly red and the majority of the costumes are red or red tone. Even the title, when translated, means red windmill.Probably the strongest thematic element would be the music. 'Moulin Rouge' is a musical, telling the story through music and dialogue. The use of music is unique in that only one song (`Come What May') is an original song specifically for 'Moulin Rouge'. Songs such as `Your Song', the various songs from `The Elephant Medley', `Come What May', and `Roxanne' all reflect the theme of love.There are many movies that try to capture the essence of love. Some succeed, some fail. 'Moulin Rouge' has definitely succeeded. Throughout the movie, the bohemian's belief in truth, freedom, beauty, and love is echoed constantly from the beginning with Christian to the bohemians reciting the line in a song at the end. As they say in the movie, the greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return.</fullReview>

I seriously went to see it in the theaters 7 times (it was a slow summer). It's a classic tale of boy falls in love with a girl he can't have and the consequences of that. Yes, it's over the top. But that's what makes it wonderful. In the first ten minutes, you find out how it's going to end, but that's the beauty of Baz. All of the actors are brilliant as well. Check it out even if you don't like musicals. My boyfriend used to fast forward through the songs in Disney movies, but even he thought it was great.10/10. Try and top it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love musicals, and I have to say that this is some of the best music that I've heard in a movie in a long time. My favorite was "Come What May", a duet between Kidman and McGregor, which was absolutely beautiful. They both have unique voices, not the best, but rich and powerful, and that's all that's needed in these songs. The only song I was disappointed with was "Like a Virgin", which absolutely sickened me and made me hate the song. I thought the tragic love story between Christian and Satine was beautiful, but a little overdramatic and overdone. Their love is best portrayed through the songs. The acting is excellent, especially on Kidman's part. I know the Moulin Rouge are like an abstract acting business, and while those aren't my favorite types of people, their costumes and makeup are very well done. The cuts are also a little too quick moving. The costumes are gorgeous, I love the flashiness of all of it. While I admit it was a little hard to follow, esepcially with all the quick cuts, the movie was great. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In an age where there are so many movies provided for us, it's easy to subscribe to the cookie-cutter films that Hollywood turns out. It's also easy for a jaded old salty dog like myself to find tedium in a lot of what is offered to us today. A movie that makes me feel like I am about 8 years old because I am excited and enthralled at what is happening on the screen is therefore, a rarity. This film is a rare gem that made me feel that way.Moulin Rouge is the story of Satine (Nicole Kidman), the most popular courtesan in Paris and Christian (Ewan MacGregor), her lover. It is an unlikely romance between an unattainable woman and an impoverished writer, which must be kept hidden because Satine has been essentially betrothed to the man who is financially backing the Moulin Rouge, The Duke (Richard Roxborough). Before this film, I could tolerate Kidman, but never thought she was anything above a mediocre actress. She always played a kind of "ice queen" in her films, with average results. In Moulin Rouge however, she literally blossoms. She proves that she can play comedy, tragedy and even sing fairly well in the course of one film. I've always liked MacGregor, who has shown a lot of versatility in his films which have been of the independent genre for the most part. Roxborough is both hilarious and frightening as the controlling Duke, and Jim Broadbent is absolutely amazing as Harold Zidler, the Emcee of the Moulin Rouge and father figure to Satine. Other than Kidman's performance, I would wager that John Leguizamo as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec is the best example of casting against type. Historically, Toulouse-Lautrec was an extremely tragic figure, and the film, while giving us the free-spirit elements to his character, also subtlety explores his darker side as well.The biggest star of Moulin Rouge however is the director, Baz Luhrmann. While I did not particularly like his first film, Strictly Ballroom, I did appreciate the colorful set designs he employed. I feel he sharpened his vision in his second film, Romeo &amp; Juliet, and then achieved perfection in this film. There is so much to appreciate: The use of sharp colors, the fantastical elements, the innovative cinematography and slick camera angles. The use of modern music to tell a story of life 100 years ago was daring, but I feel it fit into the film amazingly well. Luhrmann has become one of those directors that I will definitely seek out, regardless of the subject matter because I know that the production values will be more than worth the price of admission.**Possible Spoiler Alert**I watched this film with a friend who was really into the movie but ended up assessing that she didn't like it because she didn't like the ending since it bummed her out. You are told the ending within the first 5 minutes of the film, but that doesn't prepare you for the scene when it is actually acted out. In his last two films, Baz Luhrmann has pretty much made a habit of riding you on an emotional roller coaster - you feel happy when the characters are happy and even a cynical person like me was into the romantic story because it was so convincingly played out. I like to liken what happens next with his films as "getting hit by a truck, then run over repeatedly." He brings you to an emotional high and then pretty much crushes you, even though you knew what was coming. I have seen this movie about 5 times now and I was still bawling at several points in the film. So if you're looking for a pick me up and you want to see a great romantic comedy, this one is probably not the one you want for that mood. But if you are looking for a well-rounded film that is visually shocking and brilliantly enacted and directed, this is a must see. It is definitely one of my favorites of this century and still my pick for Best Picture of 2001.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is the best film I've seen in a long time! This film is so colorful and fun and it's so unpredictable. Nicole Kidman was breathtaking in her role as the seductive courtesan, Satine and Ewan McGregor was gorgeous as hunky, romantic, Christian. I have to give most of the credit to them for making this movie a "must-see". But all the credit should be given to Baz Luhrmann because he is the "brains of the operation". He came up with the original presentation. (I also loved Romeo+Juliet) For anyone who hasn't seen this movie, slap yourself! You should have seen it...if you had..you would have brought this movie up to number 1 at the box office. Moulin Rouge was SOOO overlooked! I'm still so disappointed that Nicole and Ewan didn't win any Oscars. They deserved it! All-in-all, I give this movie a 20 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is a beautiful, pretty well done movie. The Sets, Cinematography, and Costumes are fantastic. Its an Original idea and performed pretty well. The only problem I have with it is that it is overdone in a few areas, like the talking moon is so ridiculously stupid. The Editing is another small problem, the movie moves way too fast in areas.With the flaws aside the movie is acted very well. Nicole Kidman is actually Fantastic, Her singing is good, her acting is great. Jim Broadbent was very good in both acting and singing. Ewan McGregor is pretty good in both areas. John Leguiziamo annoyed me alot.Overall 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice movie, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Chicago before seeing Moulin Rouge. Maybe this was my fault. I came with very high hopes for this one, as many say it was the reason for Chicago's success. I have to say, it is a very foreseeable movie, the story is a classical Hollywood soap-opera, and music and dancing are really just for "decoration": The focus is always on story (the final play says it all). Unfortunately, the story didn't catch, and I wasn't touched by it a single moment.The music is not bad, if you like to recognize famous songs played a bit different. Even so, I couldn't find a single song that stayed with me, and most of them are cut to less than a minute! As I said, the focus is really on the story, which is bad enough to spoil even the rare moments of good music.Anyway, the dancing is really missing, and it could have been so much better! Except for the tango scene (which is not great, but I suppose it's the best scene in the entire movie: you should see Asfalt Tango for a much better one), I always had a feeling of frustration, trying to see the dance and moves, but the cutting and camera moves didn't allow.I think the greatest achievement of this movie is turning the attention of the audience towards musicals, and making possible the success of later movies, like Chicago. On a scale from 1 to 10, I would give 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>opera for people who are bored by operas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I was glued to the screen for two solid hours and then, listening to the closing music, even watched the credits for ten minutes (which has not happened in years), I returned to reality knowing that I had just seen a fascinating movie. Upon further reflection, it occurred to me that Moulin Rouge is really a opera; but a opera distinguished by not being boring for even one single minute. It seems that no scene lasts longer than ten seconds, there is continuing movement, there are people, colors, close-ups, all in breath-taking succession and accompanied by that gripping music. The credits say the movie was shot in Australia - if this is the Aussie style of film making, we sure want to see more of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely breathtaking. "Moulin Rouge" is director Baz Luhrman's pop music masterpiece about Christian, a struggling writer who goes to Paris, France in 1899 and falls head over heels in love with Satine, a courtesan in the French nightclub known as the Moulin Rouge. "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return!" Filmed entirely on soundstages in Australia, this haunting love story with a bittersweet ending has become a worldwide sensation. Vastly superior to the subsequently released and disappointing Hollywood musical, "Chicago" (2002), which undeservedly won "Best Picture", "Moulin Rouge" appears to have revived Hollywoods interest in musicals. "Moulin Rouge" creates a colorful magical world with remarkable sets, flashy costumes, delightful songs and an amazing cast who uniformly deliver riveting performances. Nicole Kidman in a heartbreaking performance is the ill fated "Satine" who struggles with the choice between love or fame and fortune. Ewan McGregor is touching as the heroic and naive young writer, "Christian", who fights for her love. John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburg are all three incredible in meaty roles which are both unique and truly astounding. Baz Luhrman has created a work of art which I have no doubt will in years to come be considered one of the classic films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This sounded like a chick flick to me when it first came out. Just what we need another romantic comedy, and its worse it's a musical too! Still though a friend of mine(girl of course) wanted me to see it. Reluctantly i watched it, and suddenly changed my mind very quickly. I've always liked the two main actors(Kidman and Mcgregor) and they played their part wonderfully, and have awsome singing voices as well. Yeah there was a song every ten minutes, but they weren't that bad at all, and the set design, and costumes were good as well. After this I really started to like musicals, and have since watched Chicago which i liked too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My boyfriend thought it was a bit over the top - we watched the DVD on Valentine's day and he obviously would have preferred something more peaceful. I've read similar criticisms of it. I tend to zoom in on the intimate scenes so the more flamboyant bits melt into the background. I thought musically it was excellent - my favourite scene is where the Argentinian sings Roxanne and Ewan MacGregor comes in with his own song - the counterpart is stunning. Also I had never noticed Ewan before in Brassed Off or Emma so the director really brought out his talent as a singer and got some very good visual shots too - they must both have worked very hard. I realy enjoyed the finale after the credits come up - all very romantic and stirring. I wanted to know more about the history of the Moulin Rouge after this, having seen a black and white movie on TV when I was a child. The film defintely inspired me to want more background information, about Paris in the 1890s and Toulouse Lautrec, and perhaps more about Argentina.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A SENSUAL RAVISHMENT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Moulin Rouge!" is one of the most magnificent and most entertaining music-driven spectacles ever made. From its visual opulence to its visionary amalgamation of classical storylines, the movie is a stupendously original and intoxicating romantic tale that may spark a new generation of high-tech musicals (like the recent 'Chicago') and draw a diverse array of audiences back to the multiplexes for a chance to drown in the vibrant energy and manic zest of a good, new-fashioned cinematic show. The movie is a triumph in film making. Everything from the art direction, to the costume design, to the cinematography, to the fast-paced editing techniques, to the eye-popping visual effects, the movie is a dazzling feast for the senses. But don't let that mislead you into thinking the movie is all in-your-face giddy. No, the movie succeeds also on the level of subtle romance (the chemistry between the movie's two lovers is absolutely sizzling) and compelling melodrama.It's impossible not to admire the film simply for its wonderful performances (Nicole Kidman turns in one of her very best performances ever)and directorial style. However you slice it, "Moulin Rouge!" is one of 2001's best films!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After a closer observation (and repeated viewings)...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...I finally found the method to this film's frentic madness. Before, I used to get overwhelmed and think that there was no true depth to this film and thought it was just an attempt for Baz Luhrmann to establish himself as a unique film-making style. Turns out, it's not in his pace of film-making, but in the style of his shots that seem to encompass a world in and of itself that sets him apart from flash in the pan directors like Michael Bay and McG.The film tells a heartbreaking tale of true love and how it transcends the boundaries of materialism and set standards. We have idealist Christian (Ewan McGreggor) who comes to Paris in 1899 to find his voice as a writer. As he meets a gala of colorful roommates who take him to the Moulin Rouge to pitch his play, he sees Satine, the crown jewel of the cabaret, and is instantly captivated by her. But unlike the other men who are put under her spell, Christian can see what Satine has hidden from everyone else and he falls in love with her. After Christian shows Satine that life (and love) can and does exist outside of the Moulin Rouge, they begin their love affair. But Satine is constantly dragged back into her world by The Duke who simply wants to buy her with material possessions.What the film has to say about love is that it can transcend any drudgery and elevate those whose hearts are filled with it. Even in the darkest of places where "love is available to the highest bidder" as one song suggests, if you truly love someone for who they are, then love can exist anywhere.Bax Luhrman creates a 17th-18th centuary like we've never seen, where the colors are vivid, the lighting has as many spotlights as it does shadows and the pace is more frentic than today's hustle and bustle. Though at times the songs and pace can seem out of place, it only helps to create one man's vision of the times. Luhrman's style may not be liked by many, but one cannot deny that it is his own.At first, I enjoyed Moulin Rouge, but then the pace grew so fast for me that I became exhausted with it and couldn't find the depth that I once saw in it. Then watching it again on DVD on my TV has shown me that this is the best way to watch this movie so as not to be overwhelmed by the the big screen, but seen in widescreen so the TV won't cut out every facet of this festival for the eyes and ears.Despite the ending, one can't help but feel grateful that love had existed, helped someone achieve their dream and give them the sense of freedom. And in doing that, Luhrman and company have truly embodied and modernized the Bohemian mantra of Freedom, Beauty, Truth and Love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is one of the best love stories I have ever seen. Yes, it has its tragic elements, but to me that's what makes the love story so great. It's better than some boring 'birds are singing, the sun is shining' kind of romantic movie.Now, I must admit, the first time I saw Moulin Rouge I wasn't that impressed with the love story. I think that I was concentrating too much on the imagery and the music to appreciate it. This is definitely a movie that gets better with each viewing, so if you weren't that into it the first time, I recommend you try watching it again. You'll also be sure to pick up on new things every time you watch it, as some of the earlier scenes are very fast-paced.The music is absolutely fantastic. It's so cool how Baz and Company use modern songs in unique ways. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are surprisingly very good singers!The visual effects are breathtaking, albiet a bit distracting the first time you see the film, as I have already mentioned. It's amazing what can be done with computers!I would suggest you give Moulin Rouge a try, especially if you enjoy musicals, cool visual effects, and above all things, great love stories!</fullReview>

The story was too simple and the movie could have been over in less than an hour had it not been for the songs drawing it out (every turning point had it's own song and dance routine assigned to it that lasted at least 10 minutes). Admittedly, I liked the use of modern songs in a movie set well before the songs were actually written, but the whole thing was just too boring.

I do admit I hated it the first time I saw it, but I was so bored one day that I watched it again, and I understood it! Since then I've seen it at least 30 times, and it is now my favourite movie :-) For those people bagging the lighting in this movie, I don't think you really understand why Baz used those colours. You will find that whenever Christian or Satine are sad, the lighting is blue, whenever one of the two is happy or optimistic or you can see that they are madly in love with each other, the lighting is white and/or red (these are also the French flag colours, he he he ;-)Any way, I think this is the kind of movie that you either absolutely love, or you absolutely hate, and the kind of movie you need to see twice to really understand...

		<fullReview>I went in expecting to be entertained. The production design was beautiful but the whole thing was edited so quickly I became dizzy. I sat through the whole film, but it was work. A film shouldn't be this hard to sit through. I wasn't crazy about the use of many of the popular songs (Like a Virgin) just seemed silly. And then the dancing - the dancing was completely upstaged by the editing. Did any one really dance in this film? Or did the choreography just have his dancers walk pass the camera and then piece together the footage in the editing room? I'm guessing some of those who say this is the best musical they have ever seen, have never seen a musical film in the theater (since no good ones were made in the last 17 years) But films like "Grease" and "Cabaret" were certainly better than this mess (and used original songs). I actually feel bad for the costume designer and the cinematographer who did wonderful work, which isn't on the screen long enough to be taken in or appreciated. I just hope the next wave of musical films doesn't follow the editing of "Moulin Rogue" definitely a missed opportunity.Better as a coffee table book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I could come up with some better lines on why this movie is excellent, but I was blown away, aamazed, my eyes gleamed through the whole film, I gladly added a new favorite movie to my big list. Everything was just so grand. The best thing about MOULIN ROUGE was the fact that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman did their own singing. Ewan had such a beautiful voice. It was so emotional. He talks of releasing his own album, and I hope he does. I hear of people who say that the movie rips off so many songs, but that's not the case. MOULIN ROUGE does not take credit for these songs. The essense of the songs were used to bring out the theme of the movie, and the peopel who created these songs are given full credit, especially for having created such meaningful music in the first place. Besides singing wonderfully, Ewan and Nicole gave wonderful performances. I think Ewan should have been nominated for best actor at the Acadamy. And then he should have won. (Even though Denzel was great.) Jim Broadbent was also a fantastic note. His character of Harold Zidler was outrageous. He had so much energy, and was extremely theatrical. I loved his antics. Richard Roxburgh was also very good in playing a weasly villain. His mustache and floppy hair really added to his rodent like features that just made him so irritatingly evil, that I wanted him to lose in the end. I hope everyone realizes that the four themes of this movie are true, and I hope that they spread to everyone. I can honestly say that I was inspired after watching MOULIN ROUGE. While I don't isolate myself into movies, I do believe that they teach us how things should be, and MOULIN ROUGE is no exception of a film that shows us true meanings in life. I can't stress enough how much I love this film. SPECTACULAR, SPECTACULAR!10 out of 10!</fullReview>

Baz stays so true to these themes in this film - any Bohemian should be proud..........The cast could not have been better chosen! Just incredible - Just Incredible - this film was the most moving and entertaining to come along in decades - maybe EVER........Quickly moved from a "musical" to avoid up to one of the top 5 favorite movies of all time!Just incredible - Do yourself a favor - don't just rent it - go buy it NOW!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, I am visiting friends in Colorado and they tell me I just HAVE to see Moulin Rouge! Now, I like Ewen McGregor in Trainspotting, Velvet Goldmine and others, so I said "Why Not?"Five of us sat down to watch this thing on DVD or was it VHS? I don't remember. Of the five of us, three were enthralled, laughing and crying and swooning with the "plot" for the umpteenth time. Two of us, however, glanced at each other with looks of dismay and disgust. Finally, 30 minutes into the film, Brian got up, went to the player, and pressed STOP. "Now, you all have seen this before, right?" he asked. "Yes," they assured him. "Then I hope you don't mind if we skip over this worthless piece of trash," he said kindly but seriously. I breathed a sigh of relief when our hosts, with a slightly hurt look, gave in to Brian's request.This film is a shallow and ultimately boring spectacle for the masses who eat up whatever Hollywood feeds to them. That anyone could be impressed by this pretentious and unimaginative trash amazes me. The music from Moulin Rouge! is a hodgepodge of poorly-done snippets of songs from the modern pop era. A cheesy disco version of Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit blends into equally repulsive versions of Lady Marmalade, Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend, and Material Girl. The film boasts flambouyant but shallow characters. It's a worthless and pathetic piece of trash and I had as strong a reaction to it as if I had stepped into a puddle of vomit.It was on TV again last night, and I was at home with some close friends. I decided to give the film a second chance. I made it to about 30 minutes, but this time all of us were in total agreement that this movie is the flashiest piece of crap ever passed onto the public as art. We agreed to turn it off.I suggest you do the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think all I can say is OH MY GOD! This movie/musical is the best I have ever seen in my life. For the people who don't like it have no taste in a good musical. The music, harmony, singing, acting, dancing, and the movie itself is breath taking. I never knew Nicole and Ewan can sing. They are like so real (in the movie). I watch the movie at least 3 times a day and I never get sick of it. My Dad says i'm obsesed with it and in the end I cry everytime even though I know what is going to happen. (and I HATE the Duke!) Every time I watch it, it is like the first time I have seen it. I love it more than anything. I have been in to musicals my whole like and movies. I am a singer myself and I am doing a duet with my friend. I am doing the one from the movie when they are on the roof sing "Elephant love medley" It is genues that someone can come up with this stuff. I do understand where people come from with the whole up to date music stuff... but they took the song Lady Marmalade or whatever and they turned it into a new song so why can't they take the new songs and turn it into older songs that everyone would injoy. I injoyed it more than some song that I have never heard of before and they suck royaly. But that is just my oppinion. Anyway if you are reading this just to see if you should spend your money on watching it I would say I would pay a million dollars a day to see that movie. It touches a place in my heart that I didn't know was there and it is an all rounded great movie.AliciaP.S. I am naming my first child (girl) Satine!Nicole</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Incandiferous Spectacular Spectacular!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, my summary :"Moulin Rouge!" is a brilliant surrealist assemblage/collage, grand music, beautiful cinematography. Deserves to be considered one of the great movies ever.And now the nitty gritty bitties :The first time I saw this, I enjoyed it.The second time I didn't like it as much. "So so at best" was my thought.Then one day while I was doing something else, I put it on as background and suddenly found myself paying attention. (Probably worth noting at this point that I've only seen it on TV - it takes a rare film to drag me into a theatre - but this is one film I'd love to see in a theatre.) Time to look it up in IMDB and read the comments and other information carefully. "Wow, a lot of people really like this, and a lot of people really HATE it."I made a point to watch it again the next evening, put the sound through the stereo, turn the volume up a bit, turn lights down. Often enough when I do this, about five minutes into the film I get bored and go off to do something else. Not with "Moulin Rouge!" - I was hooked.Since then I've seen it several times and every time I watch it, I find more to like - a bit more to dislike as well - but the stuff to like is by far the larger part.The plot is hackneyed, the pacing uneven, the editing at times intrusive.On the other hand ...Think Max Ernst ("Une Semaine de Bonte'"), Salvadore Dali, even Picasso. Think Lewis Carroll, Reymond Queneau, James Joyce. And most especially, remember opera."Moulin Rouge!" is a surrealist collage, a mix of dreamscape and reality. Its an impressionist cityscape built almost of pointilliste scale cinematic (and audio) Legos -- symbols, allusions, quotes, archetypes, a dash of postmodern sensibility. Its an operatic (spectacular!) spectacular with its own leitmotifs, and as (often enough) in opera, its not the story that matters most.Luhrmann presides over the production with vision and discipline. What sometimes looks like a mess on first viewing reveals itself (usually -- there are some exceptions) on closer consideration to be a very deliberately constructed stew -- filled with detail and allusion. Musically, we often hear the shortsighted say "None of the music is original" -- but why should that be a bad thing? By using music we know, Luhrmann gets to play off our associations of one piece against another, of music against performer, and of music against visual. Think Zidler doing "Like a Virgin", or the Paris toffs with "Teen Spirit".You can almost imagine Luhrmann taking a favored collection of films (and cartoons), music and other bits of cultural detritus and cutting it all up and heaping it up, then taking out bits as he comes to them and putting them all together into a whole. Luhrmann's vision combines a very carefully planned visual style, an equally carefully planned musical score, some wondrous choreography, an oddly wonderful sense of humour and, well, lots more. He builds from these pieces a whole that is brilliant, coherent, compelling, funny and wholly his own.And to top it off, its a whole pile of fun.Watch for the allusions - the moon from the Lumiere brothers is the most obvious from film, but there are many more. I think you could do a final exam for a film course by showing a ten minute segment from this film (almost at random) and asking students to note down all the films referred to.And watch for the stuff that just flashes by. I don't have a DVD player, but am tempted to get one almost this movie alone -- there are several things I'd like to look at very slowly to see if what I think is happening is really happening.A final note - "The Roxanne Tango". Gosh. Wow. Speechless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the privelege of watching the movie premiere in Hong Kong. Baz Luhrmann, director, also attended to kick off the movie. After a can-can dance, there were some technical difficulties in which the movie would not play. As i was eager to watch the film, after reading rave critics on the movie, I became worried that i might've gone for nothing. yet it was during this time when Baz came out and talked to us about the production of the film, funny things that happened, etc. luckily, the film worked, and i was in for an amazing journey which i will not forget. the music, the story, the colour, the mise en scene, the background setting, the dancing, the editing- the film was beautifully filmed, directed and edited to lead the audience into a spectacular journey. the acting and singing was simpling enthralling, and because of this i have become a fan of both ewan mcgregor and nicole kidman. Kidman should've won the oscar for her role in moulin rouge, and Mcgregor at least a nomination. nevertheless, i was most surprised and angered to hear Baz was not nominated for best director. How could he not be for such a wonderful film? For those who have not seen the film, go rent it now. you'll be mesmerised by the magic. i give the movie the fullest 10 out of 10 there can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MR! is a feast for the eyes. The movie starts with a bang and hardly ever let the fast pace slack, but the ten minute frenzy in the beginning is never reached again (thank god, because it would have been too much of a good thing). You cannot resist being impressed by the set design, decor, costumes, cinematography and all technical stuff. However, a day or two after seeing this movie, all I was left with was an impression of colors swirling before me and dancing and singing. The story!?! Well, it is easy enough to comprehend, but does it stay with you after a week. No, I don't think so. It is not involving enough somehow, even though it should be heart breaking. All in all, great entertainment, but not all is it trumped up to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must see event</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you may have noticed from the other comments, people either loved this film or despised it. That reaction alone should be enough for you to give this movie a shot and discover in which camp you belong.Visually stunning, but so unconventional that scores of people will tune out immediately. The first fifteen minutes are almost a test to see if the viewer can bend his expectations to a totally new paradigm. According to the director's commentary, this is exactly what he intended. Separate the wheat from the chaff early, let the audience know this will not be another generic musical (or film, for that matter) and then proceed with the fun. For the people that don't make it through the first fifteen minutes, thank Baz.This is a simple love story with a simple plot told in a very complex way. The movie begins by telling you the end so the viewer can enjoy the ride, and what a ride!The Moulin Rouge is about to become a real theater, with the help of the evil monied Duke. The show being written by Christian (Ewen McGregor) to accomplish this 'Spectacular' transformation is a reflection of the movie character's own lives. But wait! This is a two-way mirror. At times the stage show precedes the real action and at times 'real' life is written into the show. At other times the show and life are happening simultaneously.*small spoiler* The movie is chock full of original ideas, my favorite being the use of popular music in the score. The first time this happens you'll be asking yourself, "What the heck is this piece of music doing in this movie?", but once Ewen starts singing Elton John's 'Your Song' the device is revealed. Modern songs are used as the libretto of the movie!There has been much said about the singing talents of the lead characters, but I applaud Nicole and Ewen for having the courage to sing their own roles. I guess Baz could have cast a 'real' singer like Madonna for the lead role, but unfortunately, she can't act.Give this movie a shot, and don't be tricked into turning it off before you see what it's really all about.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie expecting to absolutely hate it. The only reason I was watching it was for a connection with something I was doing in English class at the time. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have. Musical? Ugh. Lotsa flashy lights, spectacles, costumes...? Blah. No, I'm not a fan of musical, in general. But to every rule, there are always exceptions, and 'Moulin Rouge!' is another.I'm not entirely sure why I do like it. Maybe it has something to do with the absurd musical numbers (small and not-so-small covers of Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and Madonna's "Like a Virgin," among numerous others). Maybe it has something to do with the surprisingly good storyline. Or maybe it's the quirky, bizarrely comical scene in Satine's bedroom in which she meets "the Duke," who actually is a young writer named Christian.Regardless, this is quite simply one of the best movies I've seen. I never cease to be amazed by just how much I actually did like it, after all I had expected it to be.Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

Every detail is perfect, the art direction, the costumes, the colors, the way it was directed, the music!!, the actor's performances!!!!!!, everything! it is such an original movie, i think that if we gave the script to any one but Baz Lurhmann, it could never be as it is. Every scene is wonderful in it's own way that we could repeat it and sing and love it so much! How new to old songs were put together .How every scene can move so fast and be so slow.

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is absolutely, overwhelmingly the most fantastical film that I have ever seen. I cannot believe that I missed this movie in theaters and never bothered renting it. I was so blown away by this film - which is funny, because it wasn't until I watched this movie that I remembered that as a child, I adored John Houston's Moulin Rouge. That was a very different movie, where if memory serves me right, I felt very drawn and empathetic towards Toulouse Lautrec and the Can Can girls. But it's ironic to see a movie about the same place and same period of time that is so true to the spirit of the Moulin Rouge and yet absolutely different and original from any of the movies that came before it.The cinematography is breathtaking. I know some people criticized it as being too much but I could not get enough of it. And Nicole Kidman was born to be Satine. Ewan McGregor made me feel like I was a little girl getting a childhood crush all over again for the first time. I cannot stress how much I enjoyed seeing these two opposite one another. They're not a pair I ever would've thought of, but they work so beautifully opposite each other. The music is Wonderful. So totally cool to hear Nirvana and Elton John and Marilyn's calling card and Material Girl all blended into a kind of crazy insanely cool operatic opus of modern culture. Baz Luhrman is in a league of his own and his vision is nothing short of extraordinary. I enjoyed his Romeo and Juliet due to the visuals and his unique vision of an often told story, but with Moulin Rouge he has graduated straight from grade school to a Master's Degree.Entirely it's own world - absolutely wonderful. But most of all, exquisite. He has totally resurrected and redefined the genre of the musical and it is an astounding pleasure. And Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor earned my undying support for taking a chance and committing themselves one hundred percent to the story. I'm so thrilled that it paid off for all of them and their hard work.A high recommend. And a gushing 10</fullReview>

Some don't like this film for its choppy shots and quick changes, but I think it is absolutely wonderful and original. I love the music, how they put modern songs in a movie taking place in 1899.Plus, even though it doesn't sound like it, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman have wonderful voices. They have a lot of talent and the songs they sing are wonderful. Whoever put together the songs was very wise about their choices, because in scenes like the dance hall and the Roxanne scene the layered songs sound wonderful together.I think the best part was the green fairy sequence. That was brilliantly done, esp. how the fairy would be a little line and then stop, and it was if she was bursting out. All in all, I think this is the best movie I've ever had the pleasure of watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a question in my mind that Moulin Rouge should have won the 2001 Best Picture Oscar. This film took guts to make. To mix the Dumas "Camille" story into the La Boheme Paris of Lautrec and Puccini, then to toss in pop hits spanning the past several decades is, well, a stroke of interpretive (if anachronistic) genius. As for Kidman's performance -- WOW! Couldn't take my eyes off of her. Think of the great actresses and singers coming before her in prior tellings of that story: Bernhardt, Duse, Garbo, Callas, Stratas. Kidman stands and delivers in the midst of a thumping phantasmagoria that somehow does recall the excitement, danger and romance of a long-gone era -- and, like the story requires, does it like a diva. All the men are excellent, of course, Ewan MacGregor, Jim Broadbent. Brilliant cinematography, rightfully quoting the great paintings of the era. Baz Lurhman resurrects an old chesnut of a story with the eye of an impressionist master and the ear of a rock and roller -- how'd he do that? Yes, indeed -- Moulin Rouge is a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** SPOILERS WITHIN ****** SPOILERS WITHIN ****** SPOILERS WITHIN ***Just saw this movie for the first time last night, and whew! This movie was a wild ride. The energy and the passion were incredible. This film was an explosion, a bright shining beacon of filmmaking to movie studios everywhere.I could just imagine the pitch: Doomed lovers meet in a dance hall/brothel in 1900 Paris. Oh, and it's a musical, with the actors singing modern songs. Yet somehow, studio execs took a chance on this, and bless them for it.Regardless of what anyone thinks of this film, what cannot be denied is the aggressive, infectious energy of it. It pulls you in so hard and so fast your neck is nearly broken, not to mention the rapid transitions which make you throw all sense and reason out the window. But that's the point: in the bohemian world of the Moulin Rouge, sense and reason have no place here, only truth, beauty, freedom, and love.As I watched it, I saw a distinct similarity between it and Asian action films. Both have incredible energy thrown into their "action" sequences, with wild, improbable, breakneck transitions that challenge the viewer to follow, especially when the performers pitch "Spectacular Spectacular" to the Duke.There were only two flaws that I saw. A personal dislike of mine is being shown the ending and then the rest of the film is shown in flashback. I hate knowing the ending before it occurs, and this film commits that sin.The second was the drop in energy. The first hour is one musical number after another, and then in the second it drops off to tell the story. I know that had to happen sooner or later, but after being exposed to the incredible energy of the first hour, it was a bit of a letdown.But this is still an incredible film, something that lives up to its hype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An innovative film, and very enjoyable, when the story actually begins.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been much hype about this film, especially from friends, and I was very excited to see it, especially at the prospect of hearing Ewan McGregor sing! I must say however, that I was disappointed. I was told this is probably the film of the year, and it certainly is not, with the first half lacking direction and substance, merely a collection of big show scenes that seemed to be included for all lovers of musicals and stage shows. Hence why my friends loved it!At this point I must say that I am not a great fan of Baz Luhrmanns' Romeo and Juliet. The only real part I liked was the portrayal of the rival families. To me it seemed like an extended MTV music video. So this probably clouded my judgement somewhat.Saying that, once a semblance of a story begins, it begins to seem like a film, and a wonderfully entertaining one at that. To me, the two actors who shine through are Ewan McGregor, showing that he is truly a versatile actor, and Richard Roxburgh who plays the most fantastic baddie I've seen since Charles Dance.The music sequences are brilliant, and when the characters start speaking lines from songs, that added a nice touch to the film, especially since it's something all my friends do anyway!When the plot does kick in, it kicks in quickly, and although it's a simple story of love, it's well acted, scripted and directed, with the most amazing musical sequences.An innovative film, and very enjoyable, when the story begins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is stupendous! There's absolutely no mistaking the director's style, if you're familiar with his other work. This time, he uses the glitz and glamour of the Musical, and I think it works better than his Romeo &amp; Juliet. I enjoyed that film, but Moulin Rouge is leaps and bounds better.Everything seems fresh and innovative, and as Ewan Macgregor's character says: "if you're open, I think you might enjoy it."so go in with no expectations: this is NOT your typical musical, it is Not your typical movie, it is simply divine!!</fullReview>

It elicits so many different emotions.The use of modern day pop songs laced throughout added greatly to the entertainment and thats what is was- great entertainment. The special effects and the larger than life characters wove a fascinating web that engulfed you and before I knew it, it was over.That is the mark of a good film when it only seems like it started and its finished.I, along with the whole of the male population must have fallen in love with Nicole, Tom's loss is our gain. The chemistry between her and Ewen was so hot it burnt an acid stain in my brain. I watched it pay for view and at this rate I could be bankrupt by Christmas.Enjoy !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw Moulin Rouge I really didn't know what to expect. A modern musical, using established songs for the sound track and Ewan and Nicole singing! I was blown away. I love Baz Luhrmans work anyway but I think he has excelled himself with this film. It is colourful, fun, vibrant and sad all at the same time. For me it has everything that a truely classic film should have and it is one which I can see over and over again without feeling that it has lost anything or grown tired with repeat watching.Baz Luhrmans over the top style of direction and the sheer opulance of his set productions would make this film worth viewing on its own, but add to that the wonderful chemistry between the two leads and the brilliance that is Jim Broadbent, (Like a Virgin will never be the same again!), and you have a truely enjoyable experience.Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman both do a fantastic job with the kitsch music and they can truely sing. They are sexy, romantic and tragic by turn and carry off their roles perfectly.Any fans of Baz Luhrmans Strictly Ballroom or Romeo and Juliet will probably enjoy this film, especially if they like a good sing along followed by a good cry! I know that there are people out there who didn't enjoy this film, and I can understand that it isn't everybody's cup of tea, but I for one would rate this as my favourite film of the last few years and would urge anyone to watch it and make up their minds for themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie! It is the third in Baz Lurhman's "Red Curtain Trilogy" and by far the most stunning. The same old story, told in an incredible way, Moulin Rouge follows naive Christian (Ewan Mcgregor) into Monte Martre, the world of sin. Here he meets the beautiful Satine (Nicole Kidman), and instantly falls in love. THe plot is predictable, but IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE! This film is a common story told in an extraordinary way. The sets are gorgeous, and Ewan and Nicole have got enough chemistry to carry the film themselves. The supporting cast is wonderful as well, but nothing can compare to the music. Sung by the cast themselves, the collage of modern songs in original ways will take your breath away! Heather</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent film that left me struggling, happy, and sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can't really review it without some spoilers, so consider yourself warned. I've always wanted the musical to make a comeback in a big way so when I read Moulin Rouge recieved a 6 minute standing ovation at Cannes, I was thrilled. When Missy, Mya, Christina, Pink, and Lil Kim's "Lady Marmalade" hit the ground at number one, even winning best video of 2001 at the VMA's, I was teary-eyed to say the least.And when the movie was nominated for 8 Academys, and Nicole and Baz both won Golden Globes, I was SO happy... especially when I add in the fact that Nicole's husband had publically ditched her by that time. But all this was before I watched it.Once I did, I was stunned.Obviously visually, it was to die for, fashion wise as well. Cinematically, it is a masterpiece and a monumental accomplishment for everyone associated with the film. The love story was also a real surprise here. Not that it had one, most musicals do. I just never expected it to pack a real punch. And I certainly never expected to want to see the two lovers just as much as I wanted to see the musical numbers. But I did. I really cared about them outside of the numbers.We're the choices predictable. Yep. That's cause it is an old story. But is that a bad thing in and of itself? No. Because Kidman and McGregor are so genuine, you actually fall in love with them as a couple. From the minute he sings "Your Song" I don't want to see her with anyone else but him. This is a huge testamant to all the talent on this film.They were smart in avoiding the things that stop musicals from becoming commerical sucesses-- especially when you consider the fact that they chose a period piece...which usually means bad box office.But they mixed contemporary music and original songs, ALL recorded with a 2000 drum track that is very familiar to any person that listens to music, automatically leaving you with one foot squarely in the NOW.You could probably tell, I'm a singer/musician.This is why "Lady Marmalade" was such a hit, but was also able to be used in the movie.The choices of song combinations were ingenious, amazing...and right."Roxanne" and "El Tango"? "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and "Lady Marmalade"? "Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend" and "Material Girl"?How many times have I sang "Your Song"? How many times have I heard the words "how wonderful life is, now you're in the world"? But they meant nothing to me until Moulin Rouge. Now I hear those words and think how beautiful they actually are, and how I always took them for granted. Not anymore though.Baz was right to mix the music, though I can see how some people might have wanted a more traditional version of the musical with all new songs.Re-invention just doesn't work that way sometimes.Then there are my favorite orginals If I Should Die and Come What MayThere are those that criticized Nicole's voice in this movie but she sang "If I should die" ...that very short song, to perfection.It automatically brought tears to my eyes. I can't find the words to adequately describe how her performance captured the tragedy we all know is coming, but keep pushing to the back of our minds.It was haunting.And "Come What May"...what do you say? The moment Satine uses this song to make Christian let her do what she has to do to save the show, whispering "come what may" into his ear and he pulls himself together and walks away from her, Moulin Rouge became my all-time favorite movie.When they sing this song for the last time, when Christian walks down that aisle hollering that he will always love her, I was laughing AND crying because I knew that there is only one more thing left to happen and there's no more putting it off.Like I said, Baz's musical choices were the right ones, successful re-invention doesn't always translate to convention.And the acting. Nicole Kidman had my mouth dropping open in awe of her acting. I just never knew she had that many facets inside of her. And Ewan McGregor? He alternately had me laughing, admiring him, and cheering him on. As well as breaking my heart. His heart-rending wail at the end of the movie, ripped me to shreds, I was sobbing with him.And hence my dilemma. I expected tragedy, not necessarily heartbreak.The movie's strongest theme were the ideals of truth, beauty, freedom, but above ALL things, love.An idea so simple it is mind-blowing. Especially now, when there seems to be so much hate in the world.A great theme to have an audience leave the theatre with.Above all things, LOVE.The problem is that we are left SO heartbroken over Satine, Christian's and our own loss, that we lose the positive message of the movie...at least at first.It took me hours before I was ready to even think of the positive messages cause I was too busy wiping away tears.If I have any major criticsm of the movie it's that it left us with too little.One line at the end saying "A love that will last forever" just doesn't seem to be enough to ease the pain Just a little more would have helped alot.If, let's say we see Christian walking down the street and his book "Moulin Rouge" in the window of a bookstore, reminding us that he did as Satine asked and told the world their story...or him taking her bird out to the park or something, and setting it free, honoring Satine and reminding us of how she always said she was going to fly away, then I would be hurt, but not heartbroken.The movie is still worth it though and is an instant classic. But the best thing I can say about it is that it does leave you with hope after the tears, and the ideals of the movie do takeover the forefront of your mind. All in all, a great film and a profound movie experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>incredible movie and a definite must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailers for Moulin Rouge, I thought it looked pretty good, but when it came to theaters, the more I heard about it the more turned off I became. When it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, I decided it was time to rent it, but I was still very skeptical. Half the people I knew loved it, the other half hated it. There was nothing in between. The first 30 minutes I really didn't like very much. The cinematography was great, but other than that, I was bored. However, the second Ewan McGregor starts singing Your Song to Nicole Kidman, the movie does a complete turn around. I will admit, it takes a certain kind of person to see this movie and appreciate it. I am a person who loves a very wide range of movies, from Rebel Without a Cause to Triple X to Moulin Rouge to Legally Blond to Ocean's 11. This film is very colorful, very funny, and in my opinion it is very artsy. The cinematography is amazing, the direction is awesome, and the acting is superb. Ewan McGragor and Nicole Kidman are perfect in it and compliment each other wonderfully, and John Leguizamo is hysterical in it as the dwarf Toulouse. The singing in this movie is wonderful, and the dancing is energetic and excellent. But again, it takes a certain type of person to appreciate this movie, and I know not everyone can do that. However, I strongly recommend this movie and think it is no wonder that it was nominated for best picture. It was a slap in the face that Baz Lurhman was left off the list for best director. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is not a complete waste of time, although I will say that the trite and overdone nature of the film does wear thin *very* early on. Being not only a fan of the time period, but also of modern retellings of classic stories, I also enjoy hyperkinetic movies with anachronisms and juxtaposition of film elements. I assumed that this would be a perfect movie for me to see. I was very wrong...What I saw was nothing more than eye candy, with the lack of any original plot, and a genuinely poor acting job from many veteran actors. Could this be why the Oscars it won were on technical merit, and not for any *real* movie essentials?This movie was more of an annoyance than anything else, as I actually found myself feeling like someone was playing a sustained chorus of nails down the chalkboard. I am physically disturbed that any viewer of this film could find anything redeeming other than the aforementioned technical merit in musical score, choreography, and sound.And speaking of musical score, Why take good songs and then ruin them by taking them out of context and re-scoring them to fit the bill? I found the songs more boring than the originals. We should have expected this sort of ripoff from the same director that brought you Romeo + Juliet. It isn't creative- it's pedantic!It isn't that I don't get it. I completely see the point, but it gets so lost in the frenetic nonsense of slapsticky hallucinogenic action.Moulin Rouge: a genuinely good idea gone horribly awry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Rouge is a shockingly creative and fascinating film about an original love story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film like this could VERY easily have been great, or at least much greater than it was. Consider what would have happened had they put in the time to come up with an original score that fit with the astronomical level of creativity and imagination that saturates every other element of the film - it may very well have been something as memorable as The Wizard of Oz or some of the truly great scores from film history, such as the Indiana Jones music or the Star Wars theme or any number of other great film soundtracks. But unfortunately, they decided instead to punctuate this incredible and beautiful film with covers of modern popular songs which have no business being in the movie in the first place. First of all, before I begin to complain, I should mention that it is a testament to the quality of the film when something like this is unfortunately thrown in, yet the film as a whole manages to remain a wonderful cinematic experience, it's just too bad that there was so little effort put into such a pivotal thing as the score (especially in a musical romance like this), which could have put the movie over the threshold into the realm of the truly great films. Again, I would like to point out that the performances of the songs were beautiful and wonderfully entertaining, as well as brilliantly choreographed, but even this amazing presentation does not make up for the almost complete lack of any original musical content. There are a few original songs in the movie, but it's the modern ones that are not only unoriginal, but completely disruptive to the rest of the movie. The story deals with an out of work writer in the year 1900 who goes to Paris to write his masterpiece and find true love. Once there, he finds himself stalled by writer's block, but soon finds himself whirled through a dizzying sequence of events that inadvertently send him on the way to accomplish the very goal that he set out for, although not in exactly the way that he had anticipated. This is where the originality comes in, as we are presented with a fascinating although initially superficial romantic plot which is enormously exaggerated but not beyond belief even for a moment. The Parisian night life that we are presented with is huge and glittery and rich and loud, and we are so enraptured by it that we don't doubt for a minute that this is exactly what the night life was like at the Moulin Rouge in 1900. However, this brilliant story is also exactly where the movie begins to falter. True, this is almost surely a vastly exaggerated account of what nights were really like at the Moulin Rouge during this time, but it's so well presented that it is remarkably easy to believe. Unfortunately, we are periodically confused by performances of popular modern songs. Now, I can't say that I was altogether disappointed with all of these performances. Indeed, many of them were genuinely entertaining and well done (although I almost had to leave the room when The Police's `Roxanne' was belligerently performed), but they feel like speed bumps in the film. This is such an enjoyable and convincing film that it's horribly disappointing that they decided to throw songs like `Smells Like Teen Spirit' and that Whitney Houston song into the mix, almost mocking the audience for trying to enjoy the turn-of-the-century world that's presented. Moulin Rouge is something of a strange phenomenon, then, because it is a truly great film that was brought down by the childish addition of modern music. There is no fathomable reason that a film that takes place in 1900 should contain these songs, even though they were quite often well done. It was interesting to learn that both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor have wonderful singing voices, but the presentation of modern music does nothing but remove the audience from the world that we have been drawn into and remind us that we are watching a movie, and a movie that's trying to make a bad joke, at that. There is no mystery as to why Moulin Rouge was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture of 2001, but there is also no mystery as to why it didn't win that Oscar (and there is even LESS mystery on that subject when you've seen the other nominees, particularly A Beautiful Mind, the earth-quakingly good winner). Moulin Rouge in inarguably one of the best films released in 2001, but it was sadly held down by its soundtrack. It should be noted, however, that the music in the film was beautifully done and that the performances were for the most part nearly as good as the rest of the film, but they are so incongruous with the content of the film that they can only count against it. A musical romance is so centered on the music in the film that if the music doesn't work for it, the film as a whole suffers, and it's too bad because Moulin Rouge could easily have fit in as one of cinematic history's truly groundbreaking and memorable films.</fullReview>

I love the cast they chose for the film. They all have beautiful voices. Except maybe the Duke. He seems a lil awkward but fits the part just right. If you love music and have not seen this film. Go see it right now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to have liked Moulin Rouge but I felt as if I was being thwacked in the face with a cold trout the whole time. The musical jokes were clever, the dance numbers were great - but all too choppy. Could they really sing? I didn't enjoy listening to Nicole or Ewan trying to belt out songs with their flat voices. This film seemed to have an identity crisis - the concept was brilliant but the presentation aggravating. I should have had a glass of absinthe first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Moulin Rouge!" is Spectacular!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's quite new what I do, but if you are open, you might enjoy it". This description of Christian's poetry can be applied to the own movie. If you are open, you'll not only enjoy it, but completely fall in love with it. You'll watch it over and over again. You'll pay a lot just to have the dvd. You'll run to find the soundtrack and the original versions of all the songs. You'll read every single material you find about it. That's the only way to like it. You must really dive in. You can't just enjoy it. You can either love it or hate it. If it's possible to hate it? Unfortunately yes. If you're not open, if you're not an uncurable romantic, if you're not a dreamer, if you are as cinical as the World let you, you'll hate it. You'll think its musical dialogues are boring, you'll think the roof scene is ridiculous, you'll think its plot is predictable. Thank God I'm in the first group.We, I'm sure you are one of us, love this movie so much that we can not explain. "Because those who loves never knows what loves, or why he loves, or what is to love" Fernando Pessoa. I can name a number of reasons why this movie is so great, but I won't know how to explain the reason why. When you watch "Moulin Rouge!" you leave your place as a simple watcher and you became part of it. You live all the experiences together with those characters, you really dive into that World of fantasy.When you watch it for the first time without having a clue about what you're going to find, you have a mix of sensations that goes from anxiety to a "funny feeling inside that we can't easily hide". Soon you'll be introduced to the Moulin Rouge with a magnificent entrance. We go crazy when we recognize our favourite songs. Then a magnificent Nicole Kidman appears from the top. Then we'll go from scene to scene being surprised each time. "Your Song" enchant ourselves in every possible way. We can't believe what our eyes are seeing when they dance on the roof with an umbrella just like Mary Poppins. Then the "Elephant Medley" give us a knock out. From this point on if we were captured by it, there's no way out. We've became one of them. If we didn't, we'll only want it to finish as soon as possible.I have a number of friends that are just like me, film buffs that love "Moulin Rouge!", I mean really "love", it's not like they've seen it and "loved" it, they still do, and will always do. But, I have a few friends that against all odds didn't like it. It's really hard to review on a film that cannot be described. I guess I could say how wonderful it's scenery, visual effects and figurine are, but I think you all know that. To talk about the cast is totally unnecessary, everybody knows how they sing, act and dance like complete artists, that old fashioned ones. I'm pretty sure that it wasn't just with Ewan McGregor not to be nominated to any award, Nicole Kidman was nominated. I could go on and on talking about my favourite movie in years, but I guess I've said enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beneath the Sensory Extravaganza there is More than Meets the Eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge, for me, is one of those unique films that cannot fully be appreciated until it is viewed for at least a second, and maybe a third time. After my first encounter with Moulin Rouge I found myself making the usual comments: Colorful, lively soundtrack, fine performances, but at times visually distracting and unnerving, but an overall good movie that I enjoyed. But after a second viewing, I discovered so much, much more.Beneath the soundtrack, slick editing, elaborate costuming and eclectic sets is, at heart, a simplistic, emotional love story. That the plot is simplistic and not terribly original cannot be denied. However, like most great stories, it is this simplicity that allows the performers to carry the show, to utterly convince us that this story is important and worth telling. Plot complexity would merely distract from the emotional, sincere portrayals given by the cast. It is the performances and director Baz Luhrman's willingness to capitalize on them rather than subjugate them to visual frenzy that transform Moulin Rouge from a fun song and dance number into poetic filmmaking.Ewan McGregor is perfect as the idealistic, hopeful romantic who woos the world (and Satine) with his song. He is unafraid to expose himself as an actor emotionally and whimsically. Jim Broadbent as Zidler is clever and witty with just enough bombast to make us like a character who at his core should not be very likable. And Richard Roxburgh does a fine job in the end of turning what could have been a prototypical "foppish bad guy" into a more complicated villain with real pain of his own. All the actors sing effectively (particularly Kidman and McGregor) and they use the songs not as an interruption to entertain us, but to further the story in an effective, emotional way.Ultimately, in this writer's humble opinion, it is Nicole Kidman who pushes the movie to the highest level. Unfortunately, before this film, I was one of the many who perceived Kidman as a decent talent, but successful largely due to her husband's coattails. I stand corrected. In Moulin Rouge Kidman conveys more emotion with simply her eyes than most actresses can do with a hundred words. What makes her performance extra special is the ability to tell the story without saying a word. Kidman's character goes through changes, some subtle and not-so-subtle, that pushes the actress to great work. In the Elephant Love Medley, if one can stop from rollicking along with the music (which admittedly is difficult to do)and observe Kidman's acting, it is a marvelous thing to behold. She evolves through defiance, amusement, wonder, fear, doubt, hope and finally embraces Christian's love, and she does all this definitively and effectively in three and a half minutes.Kidman takes us through Satine's complicated journey throughout the movie. She is a woman yearning for what she has never known (true love), but certain that yearning will lead to destitution and heartbreak. She dives in with Christian, only to realize, despite her anguish, that this love cannot succeed, it is just not meant to be. Of course she comes to realize Christian is a man who loves her more than he loves what she can provide and do for him. She is astounded by this and commits to him no matter what, until she realizes she is dying and cannot offer him anything. It is painful to watch her fight with the idea and resolution of telling Christian she doesn't love him and must send him away.Beneath the flash and bang of Moulin Rouge exists the picture I just described, and if we let it, it will take us on an emotional ride with which we can relate, share and feel. We really do feel for the characters and understand their love, sorrow, love and pain. This is the Moulin Rouge I saw the second time around, and it has made all the difference. I challenge others out there to give this movie the same chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After due consideration, I have decided that the ever coveted last spot on my top 5 films of all time list has been filled by a captivating piece of cinematic brilliance called "Moulin Rouge!". To call "Moulin Rouge!" a film is an act of uninhibited slander, for it is nothing short of transcendental cinematic excellence. Baz Luhrman weaves such rich tapestry of well placed fades, camera movement and clever inserts of Christian's narrative typewriter that truly make this an example of modern day storytelling, full of the revolutionary bohemian ideals around which the film revolves, and not merely part of the money making hollywood bourgeoisie. The script is brilliant, with the writers finding clever ways of steering the character's converstations into classic songs, with tweaked lyrics to further the story. An example of this is how Ziedler artfully stalls the Duke from noticing Satine's apparent disappearance by saying, "you make her feel like a virgin!" which of course leads into a slightly comical rendition of Madonna's "Like a Virgin" performed by two men, one slightly overweight, one slightly under. The cast is stellar. Ewan McGregor proves he has what it takes to be one of Hollywood's top leading men, with a great range of skills that is not limited to a withdrawal sickened Heroin addict or a Saber wielding Jedi. John Leguizamo as the diminutive Toulouse, gives his best performance since "To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar". And no words can be said to describe the Beautiful Nicole Kidman except "stunning enchantress". All these elements combine to create one of the best films of 2001, but of all the aspects of this multifaceted masterpiece one rises above the rest. The Score. The songs, unlike in most musicals, aren't an uncomfortable break in the flow of the film. In fact, not merely musical interludes, the song and dance numbers all help to further the story by driving home emotions that are intensified for the audience, by the powerful music with which they are delivered. An example is the full orchestral Tango scene in which the Argentinean explains to the crestfallen Christain, why one should never fall in love with a woman who sells herself, via a latin flavored version of Roxanne. I am not one who usually enjoys musicals, in fact most drive me insane, so it came to me as quite a shock that I loved this movie as much as I do. When i first saw it I regarded it as good and not much more, but after re-watching it a few times, I've been captivated by the sheer joy of imagining a world full of fun and fancy, magic and mystery, and of course true love. Not only was it artfully directed and beautifully written but it was also an example of a genuine love story. And when it comes down to it, that's all Moulin Rouge really is. A story about Love, a never ending, undying, perpetual, and all encompassing love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw MOULIN ROUGE, I wasn't sure what to expect. Musicals have been on the rise thanks in part to EVITA. MOULIN ROUGE broke all the rules and showed that a movie musical can work in this day and time. EVITA, DANCER IN THE DARK, LOVE'S LABOR LOST, and HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH all led up to this one great moment in time. MOULIN ROUGE is stylish, creative and vivid. Thus far, I have seen the movie 15 times. I saw it eight times in the theatre (I had lots of dates at that time) and the rest on DVD - which by the way, is amazing in it's own rights and I suggest that if you don't own a DVD player, get it just to see this film and all the extra behind the scenes that go with it. It was a great shame that Ewan and Baz were not nominated for Oscars for their work on the film and showed Hollywoods lack of imagination (for the most part) in knowing great film-making when they see it. I can't wait to see what Baz will do next with the screen adaptation of the Tony Award winning musical RENT - not to mention the buzz that Baz may bring two of his movies, STRICTLY BALLROOM and MOULIN ROUGE, to the Broadway stage. This man is bound for greatness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the best movie Baz Lutherman did.I didn't really expect the beginning to be like it was with Christian all dramatic and typing on a typewriter!But later on, I liked it. I started to like it when "Satine" started to sing that "Diamonds are a girls best friend!" song. It was marvelous!The only part that was a bit stupid was when "Satine" went to sleep with the "duke" but decided not to since she saw "Christian" looking at them.I simply loved the last part starting with when "Christian" pays "Satine" and she brings him back with the "Come what may" song.I loved this move. I don't like much musicals but this was a great movie!And also, movie critics if you didn't like this one, why don't you just make your own version of Moulin Rouge! and maybe the actress you hire to play "Satine" will wind up getting a "Worst actress in a musical" award!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always been a fan of Baz's work ever since Romeo and Juliet. He can capture a love so well. For all you people that didn't like it because of the remix's, if you would watch the little commentary byBaz on the DVD, he explains that he used pop music and 90's music because he wanted us, the audience, to feel the enjoyment that the real people felt with their music. He basically just made it modern music so that we could understand more on what was happening during that time period in that region. Beautiful movie. Excellent vocal talents by Nicole and Ewan..who would've thought that they could sing the way they did. At first the movie's pretty out there, but it softens down towards the end. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Baz, the director did "Strictly Ballroom", then "William Shakespeare's--Romeo+Juliet" for a sequel and for a trilogy. Can he make a musical movie without screwing up?...YES HE CAN CAN CAN! YES HE CAN CAN CAN! Moulin Rouge is the best musical movie I have ever seen in my 17years of existance here on Earth. This should be the number one musical ever instead of that West Side Story one. Nicole and Ewan did a wonderful job in this movie. Actually Ewan is my favourite actor and knowing that he's in this movie made me even more desperate to see this. Nicole Kidman is so sexy, no matter what her costume is, she is so hot! I really like the songs they put in this movie especially the *Elephant Medley* and *Come What May* The song with an Indian singer &amp; Nicole for the last half is so cool. Every time I hear that song I feel like dancing! 'Cause this movie so good, I bought it on DVD. Buy or rent this movie people, this is the movie that will make you watch it over and over again. I hope Baz's next project is as good as his previous ones. U ROCK BAZ BUDDY! :-) </fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far one of the greatest movies of 2001. Nicole Kidman gives a "Spectacular Spectacular" preformance. Ewan McGregor used his charm and acting ability to make you love him and his character! Great cast and great acting make this movie a must see. The fact that they can blend songs from 1930ish to 2000 is amazing! The lead characters will attract you to the movie, and the music will keep you yelling for more! Truly a great film that involves drama, comedy, music, and dancing while not falling to the chick flick genre. One of the greatest parts of the movie however is only on the video as the extented dance scene. This scene truly shows that it will be a cult movie and a Broadway hopeful! DO NOT let the fact that Lil Kim, Maya, Christina Augurliara, and Pink do a song for the soundtrack! THe music in the movie is far better including songs from Elton John, Madonna, Beck, Nirvana, Pattie LaBell, Bono, Sting (the Police), and sooooo many more! Fall into love with this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no idea what to expect from Moulin Rouge except for i knew it was a musical which fills me with dread as i hate musicals.What i saw was a brilliant piece of film making that is unlike anything i have seen before. For starters the music was not what i was expecting , it encorporates modern pop songs instead of fluffy , new , songs which made it all the more enjoyable. The photography is fantastic especially the panning from one building to another and the rushing from street to street and the set is brilliant. The story is hardly rocket science and is easy to follow especially because the cast is headed by two brilliant young performers in Nocole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.The rest of the cast are superb too. If you have any pre concieved ideas about Moulin Rouge forget them and enjoy. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are movies that are so good, they leave you speechless. With his unique perception of film making, Baz Luhrman makes you laugh and cry at almost the same time, and both will be genuine. This Spectacular, Spectacular movie is unlike anything I have ever experienced in a theater. It is an overwhelming, frantic, loud, deep and touching celebration of the Bohemian ideals: Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and, of course, most of all, Love. The approach to the story is distinctly Luhrman, who absolutely forbids us to forget that this is a movie (as in "not real"), but who, at the same time, makes it impossible for us not to feel for his characters. This is accomplished on one hand because he tells us a story that, for all its sparkling surface, its garish colours and its hectic movement, is still a real story, with people in it that are so well drawn that they come alive. On the other hand, of course, the merit goes to the brilliant actors, one and all, who give breath and heart to their characters. Ewan MacGregor and, above all, Nicole Kidman, the Sparkling Diamond, draw us in and make us love them and love and suffer with them, to the very end. In 2001, a good year for movies in general, this one is the best and most daring of all.</fullReview>

But whatever, what's done is done I guess(highway robbery).The movie's musical numbers fill you with so much joy and that sense of 'wow, that was pretty cool' feeling. It's really an amazing movie. The choice of songs somehow fit(save for a couple of songs, ie. that 'diamonds are a girls best friend' tune that gets sung over and over again throughout the movie I coulda done without) The storyline itself is of course, very 'Broadway' and thus, I don't mind at all that it didn't win Best Picture, but I still stand by my Best Director choice.I can sense a bunch of movies will come out soon attempting to copy Moulin Rouge, and frankly, I can't wait, here's hoping they don't ruin this newly realized genre'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, I was a bit sceptical when I heard that Nicole Kidman was going to sing and dance in a musical. This, I thought, couldn't be from the waife that brought us some memorable characters--one being Tom Cruise's wife...nevertheless, I was amazed!Tonight I saw Moulin Rouge! for the second time. The first time I was numbed by the dance, color, tectures and animated characters...quite frankly, it felt like a real bad acid trip. But having seen it that very first time really made me want to see it again. It was funny because I tend to shy away from a second viewing of a film until sufficient time has past that I can forget about the plot and watch it with a clear mind. Moulin Rouge! noooooo, not a chance. As soon as I saw the movie, I wanted to see it again, and you know, really...I don't think everybody has seen it all noticing all the rich decor, wonderful lighting and background action. I think it's because the cinematography was done so beautifully that it really makes to step back to see it all at different angles.The story itself is simple: Love told through song. And trust me, a musical such as this--you have never seen. The casting was very well done, the lighting, cinematography, direction...all of it was fabulous. I don't think I even have a complaint about this movie, it is just wonderful and really a must-watch movie to enjoy over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a suggestion for you. Watch it again. The first time I watched it, it was all I could do to sit through it until the end. I too was disgraced at the anachronisms, especially musical. Nothing was accurate to 1899 Paris. Then when it ended, I thought to myself, "I kind of understand what this is all about." So I rewound it and watched it again. Since then I have seen it three more times. It is my all-time favourite movie. Watch it again and don't take it too seriously. Realize that everything, accurate to 1899 Paris or not, is there to help tell the story of their love. Allow yourself to laugh at the silly "Like a Virgin" dancers and be shocked when Christian yells, "Because she doesn't love you!" Forget that it's predictable and not historically correct. Get lost in the story, music, and visual effects, and I promise, you will cry when Satine dies.</fullReview>

Add to that a wonderful musical production, a great story, and great acting from top to bottom, and Moulin Rouge is my favorite film from 2001. (Believe me, that surprises me more than you.)That is especially significant considering that I have never liked musicals, and I have rarely liked such a love story. I suppose most teenage males wouldn't. But I saw, I liked, and eventually nothing could top it. The best reason for this, I think, is the soundtrack. I was absolutely taken aback by the music from this film. I bought the soundtrack, bought the second volume, bought the promotional score, and even ripped audio from the DVD that couldn't be found on any musical release.Of course, this film isn't for everyone, and the awards shows earlier this year have proven that. Still, Moulin Rouge was (in my humble opinion) the best movie of 2001, and one of the best of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Musical of 2001 sets us up for the Best Musical on Broadway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is probably the most glamorous and majestic film to date. Many films have tried to be like Moulin Rouge but none can compare. Highlighted by beautiful cinematography and vivid acting, (Nicole Kidman was utterly breath-taking,) Moulin Rouge gave the audience a trip into a colorful world unexplored by any filmakers. The one tick I have is why the Academy was so stupid to leave Baz Luhrmann out of the race for best director. ALL of the film is a genuine product of his beautiful mind, (wink, wink!) It has been the talk of Hollywood lately that 'Rouge' is being considered for Broadway adaptation. I say go for it! It can't be a bigger flub than the skewing of Lurhmann for the Oscar. I am now a bona fide fan of his, and i would love to see him bring "Rent" to the silver screen.(if you havent heard about this, click on his name.) **** (4 out of 4) -Give my regards to Broadway, remember me to Harold Square!-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not only visual masterpiece, it is well acted, has a great story line and wonderful soundtrack. Not to mention that Ewan McGregor is not only very attractive, but has a GREAT singing voice. This is the best musical I have ever seen. Music speaks to you in a different language then words, and words that seem so simple can bring you to your knees when sung. This is my favorite movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film will simply dazzle you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget everything you thought you knew about the Hollywood musical. Forget anyone who ever said that the musical was dead; that it was a relic of the past, and that reviving it was a recipe for disaster. Baz Luhrmann never listens to people like that anyway, and Moulin Rouge - his latest in a career seemingly based on flying in the face of conventional wisdom - is a stunning masterpiece of visual and musical achievement, and richly deserved all the accolades it received as one of the best films of 2001.Set in 1900, Moulin Rouge tells the story of Christian (Ewan MacGregor), a struggling writer who falls in with a group of Bohemian actors and tries to sell a show to the owner of the famed Paris nightclub Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent). To get his pitch heard, Christian approaches the most desired courtesan in the club, Satine (Nicole Kidman), and while he finds himself smitten by the girl's obvious charms, is competing for her heart with the Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh), whom Zidler is wooing as an investor in the Moulin Rouge.Basically, it's a formula plot straight from the grand musicals of the fifties - girl must choose between true love and a wealthy suitor - and one of the many brilliant points of the film is that this very plot is also the subject of Christian's production: the very aptly named Spectacular Spectacular! From the first time Christian sets foot in the Rouge, the film takes the viewer in every direction imaginable, never content with just a straightforward telling of the love story. Everything is wrapped in dramatics and theatrics, song and dance, costumes and flair - and it's both familiar and original. The songs are inspired in choice and arrangement, as most of them are covers of love song standards (Elton John's "Your Song") or very unusual choices ("Smells Like Teen Spirit," or "Lady Marmalade"), mixed in with some Beatles classics and Whitney Houston ballads. But none of these are quite the same once rendered by the impeccable voice talents of Broadbent, Roxburgh, MacGregor and Kidman. Every anguished confession of love is sung through one of these timeless lyrics (or the occasional original song, such as "Come What May"), and woven into the story seamlessly, as if they were written directly for the screen. Nothing seems out of place, no matter how different it might be at first glance. Even "Roxanne," by the Police, is reinvented as a tango, and is one of the more haunting set pieces as it's interspersed with Christian's budding jealousy towards the Duke. MacGregor and Kidman, not noted for their singing voices in the past, acquit themselves very well here, showing off good ranges and talents combined with their well-earned acting chops. This is no throwaway story in their hands; you yearn for Satine as much as Christian does, and you weep when she weeps, and you ache when they both ache. The Bohemian tenets of Freedom, Beauty, Truth and Love are all in effect here, as Luhrmann takes his vision and paints the canvas of the screen in a beautiful array of visuals that most directors would never even imagine, let alone try. Perfect costuming, a frenetic pace, and a game cast willing to try anything for the show provide two hours of blisteringly good entertainment. By the way, don't be ashamed if this film makes you laugh, makes you dance, makes you sing, and makes you cry. It's worked quite hard to make you do all of those things. Brilliant film-making. Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I saw this movie, I heard that you either love it or you hate it...I LOVE it! I can understand why some people don't like it...after all, it wasn't anything like what I was really expecting (I hadn't looked into the summaries very much). If you try to take it seriously, then you may become irritated with the use of late-20th century music in a film set in 1900. Or maybe you are offended by the parody of the Sound of Music (which happens to be my all time favorite movie) or the operatic rendition of Madonna's "Like a Virgin" or the medley of Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" with Fatboy Slim's "Because We Can" or John Lennon's "All You Need is Love" with Dolly Parton's "I Will Always Love You." However, I challenge you to look beyond the dates and titles and just let the movie take you along for the incredible journey. It's amazing how well it draws you into the atmosphere of the Moulin Rouge and, if you're like me, then when it's over, you will surprise yourself at just how into it you really were. I was amazed by the overwhelming amount of emotion, intrigue, and dazzlement that I experienced while watching this film. It captivated me more than any other recent movie. It truly is a film that captures the essence of the Bohemian ideologies of truth, beauty, freedom, and above all else, love. Watch this movie, and be reminded that "the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return."</fullReview>

Now I keep watching it over and over again and repeating my favourite parts.

		<fullReview>*Contains spoilers!*This is by far, the best movie I have ever seen.When I first heard of it, I didn't really know much about it. Then one of my friends who was extremely obsessed with it was talking about it all the time and I thought, "You know, I'll just see it so I know what she's talking about."And I LOVED it!Christian, a penniless poet who lives in middle-class London, goes off to Montmartre, Paris to become part of the Bohemian Revolution. While he's there, he meets up with the Bohemian Hobos, led by the French artist, Toulouse-Lautrec. They are amazed by his Bohemian-ish style and decide for him to write the show that is going to be put on by the Moulin Rouge. While he's there at the Moulin Rouge, he is to present his poetry to Satine, the Sparkling Diamond(A courtesan at the Moulin Rouge). She mistakes him for the Duke, who is the investor of the show. Christian and Satine fall in a star-crossed love that eventually, everyone knows about except the Duke. Also, practically no one knows that Satine is slowly dying of consumption. The more Christian and Satine's love grows, the harder it is to keep a secret. When the Duke gets suspicious of a relationship between them, Satine offers to sleep with him to prove there is no such thing. During supper, the Duke finally figures out the love between Satine and Christian. He attempts to rape her and...Well, I'll let you find out. Anyway, later Christian and Satine decide they are going to leave the Moulin Rouge even if the show is the next day. Satine goes to pack her things and meets Zidler there. Zidler tells her that the Duke is going to kill Christian if she doesn't sleep with him opening night and the show doesn't go his way. Satine still persists and makes another attempt to leave, but then Zidler breaks the news to her that she's dying. He convinces her to tell Christian she doesn't love him for his sake. Christian is heartbroken and goes to the Moulin Rouge to "pay his whore" before he leaves. Satine's life is coming to an end and at the end of the show, she's able to tell Christian she still loves him before she dies in his arms.*wipes a tear from her cheek* My, I'm good at making a short story long, aren't I?Moulin Rouge is basically everything you want in a movie. Humor, drama, music and above all things, love! It is "a story about love," after all. :)The mix between turn of the century Paris and 20th century songs is amazing! They use songs such as, "Your Song," "Roxanne," and a hilarious version of "Like A Virgin." That's just a few of the wonderful songs sung in Moulin Rouge.Nicole Kidman (Satine) and Ewan McGregor (Christain) do a phenomenal job in the singing, dancing and acting(Every note they sing is their own voice). Co-stars, John Leguizamo (Toulouse-Lautrec), Jim Broadbent (Harold Zidler) and Richard Roxburgh (The Duke) also do a delightful job.The way Baz Luhrmann (director) presents Moulin Rouge is beautiful. The special effects are just amazing!The death scene is...Well, I can't really think of words to explain it; I don't remember a time I've seen the movie and NOT cried!Most likely, you have now realized I LOVE the movie and I hope you go out and see the movie if you already haven't!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Energy and Charisma not usually seen in main-stream film ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The weekend prior to the Academy Awards, I decided I could avoid it no longer, and I rented "Moulin Rouge!" As a devotee of classic musicals, I thought I would be offended and disappointed by a film that destroyed their legacy rather than honoring or bettering it. Boy, was I ever wrong! From the opening seconds of the film, I was shocked, dazzled and inspired. As I have since learned, the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice (with a large chunk of appreciation due to "Camille") served as the source material for this unbelievable piece of showmanship. Each shot (and they are seemingly endless) was carefully planned, is part of both story and atmosphere and is unlike practically anything else produced today. Each member of the cast is wonderful, maintaining the perfect balance between melodrama and true passion/emotion, all with this fantastic self-awareness. "Moulin Rouge!" performs for the viewer, asking at each turn whether he/she is satisfied. Lines, songs, costumes: they all change the ultimate outcome of the story, but if you are unsatisfied, wait just a few minutes, and they will change it again, aware of their power and yet free of pretension. No comments on this movie would be complete without a word about the magnificent singing voices of those involved. When Ewan McGregor pops up with "The hills are alive ... " and later "My gift is my song ... " my mouth dropped open. And Nicole Kidman, descending on that trapeze murmuring "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend" - I almost applauded. This IS what musicals are all about: Spectacular, Spectacular!And so somehow, this film works. It works and it laughs at the cynic who thought it would fail.After the first hour, I was ready to change my Oscar predictions. How could something of this magnitude be ignored? Yes, it is gaudy and garish. Yes, the actors do spontaneously burst into song and dance about. Yes, Baz was more than a little obnoxious in interviews in the weeks before. But isn't that the point? Unfortunately, Oscar voters would like to distance themselves from their craft. On "the big night," they seem to desire that which is safe, that which is normal, that which is mundane. "Moulin Rouge!" is none of these; and although my first predictions of its success were wrong, I feel positive that this film will survive and entertain as long as people are interested in intelligent, stimulating art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fantastic musical! I loved every second of the "SPECTACULAR, SPECTACULAR!" I can't understand how "A Beautiful Mind" won the Best Picture Oscar over this magnificent production.The moral that is given in "Moulin Rouge" is something that I firmly believe in. "THE GREATEST THING IN LIFE, IS TO LOVE SOMEONE AND TO BE LOVED IN RETURN!!!"Throughout the centuries philosophers have tried to describe what life is about with thousands upon thousands of words used in each of their complex discourses. I wonder what the ancients would have replied to the moral stated here? The only philosopher that I can think of that comes close to giving us something so true and yet so simple is Jesus Christ.Joseph Campbell abridged these words of wisdom even further when he said to Bill Moyers during an interview shortly before his death, "FOLLOW YOUR BLISS!"BRAVO!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Thing You'll Ever Learn...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is just to see this movie! This is perhaps one of the best movies I've ever seen. It starts out with scenes that make you feel like you're on drugs but soon turns into a wonderful story. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are superb as Satine and Christian, who become the Romeo and Juliet of France. Satine's a high class prostitute that mistakes Christian, a poor poet, for a Duke and makes him fall in love with her. Meanwhile, the real Duke obtains the deeds to the Moulin Rouge, an exciting night club, and demands that he own Satine while he is there. Zidler, Satine's pimp, orders her to end any feelings she has for Christian, in fear he will lose ownership of the Moulin Rouge. But the lovers will not be torn apart and all hell breaks loose until the final, tragic ending. This is a must-see movie filled with laughs, gasps, beautiful songs, and some intense dance numbers. (Watch for the "Roxanne" dance number, it keeps you on the edge of your seat.)I particularly like Christian's quotes: "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return." I was very sad to see that this won almost no Oscars, but I gave it a 10. Just remember: All you need is love! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Freedom~~Beauty~~Truth~~Love~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a graphic designer, I found this movie appealing for it's intricate visual imagery and synthesis of old and new. Due to the bizarre marketing strategy used in the United States, I had no idea this movie was a musical until I entered the theatre, and I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised. The dance sequences definitely lived up to my expectations from Luhrmann's previous work (namely Strictly Ballroom).The film isn't for everyone. Either you will love it or hate it, but I encourage people to view it with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Rouge!, the best of the Red Curtain Trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who are not familiar with the background story behind Moulin Rouge!, allow me to sum it up in several sentences. Baz Luhrmann, the director, wanted to make three movies that expressed love in three different ways: (in order) through dance, words, and music. He called it the Red Curtain Trilogy. The first in his series was called Strictly Ballroom, a little-known romantic comedy filmed in his native Australian language. The second -- which was more popular in the U.S. than his previous -- was William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes as the two star-crossed lovers (anyone who has seen Moulin Rouge! should have made the obvious connection between the two films). And his last -- and best -- was Moulin Rouge!. The first time I sat down to watch the film, I shut it off after the first half-hour. I found it way too bizarre and glamorous, and thought I couldn't put up with another 100 minutes without getting a serious migraine. But everyone continued to recommend it to me, describing how amazing it was. So I gave it a second chance, and I am very glad that I did. If you can overcome the flashy introduction (I've noticed that Baz likes to start out with a bang rather than end with one) you are bound to enjoy the rest of the film. The music is incredible (some accused the film of ruining an Elton John classic, but I thought it had a rather wonderful translation of Your Song) and the costumes are spellbinding. It is one of those movies in which the viewer finds himself sharing every emotion the protagonist undergoes, from his falling in love to the loss of his lover. I particularly enjoyed the tango-ized version of Roxanne, which worked perfectly at expressing the agonizing jealousy Ewan McGregor's character undergoes. I also thought it was neat that the two leads (McGregor and Kidman) both used their own voices for the songs they sang in the film. In the end, you will find there is no particular reason for loving it as much as you will -- or, in other cases, hating it as much as you might. All I can say is this: just see it.Overall rating: 10/10</fullReview>

The soundtrack is amazing as well. I have over 100 CD's, but this one hasn't come out of my stereo since I bought it about a month ago. However, this is no Sound of Music. It's by no means a traditional musical. The soundtrack mostly consists of pop songs constructed so they're almost unrecognizable, and if you can forget that these songs weren't around in 1901, when the film is set, you'll love it. Almost everyone I know has seen this film and most have loved it, so I would recommend it to almost anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When was the last time a movie made you cry?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No movie _ever_ has made me feel as strongly as this one. An enormous catharsis, that's what this movie is. The strongest of feelings: love, sorrow, jealousy, etc. Absolutely everything in this movie just fits in, from the ultra modern camera action to the themes that are as old as man himself.The basic story is actually a very shakespearenian tragedy - reminding of Shakespeare In Love and the most recent version of Romeo And Juliet (which was, by the way, directed by the same man than this one). From the opening scene it's obvious that there will be no happy ending on this one, and the whole plot could very well be crafted by Shakespeare himself.Also this is a musical, in a way it follows the footsteps of many former musical classics, like Singing In The Rain for example. But most of all this is A MOVIE, an audiovisual experience at it's best! Very rarely, if ever has there been such a collaboration between the direction, cinematography, acting, music, and script as in Moulin Rouge! Watching this movie was like taking a giant load off my back, it somehow freed me of any bad thoughts I had, a catharsis as I mentioned.Besides, this movie made me cry, a thing no movie has accomplished in at least ten years, and that really is a compliment from a movie freak like me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beauty and truth of Moulin Rouge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How to begin to describe the way that Moulin Rouge will make you feel? This movie breathes of sentiment. Baz Luhrmann created a masterpiece, a story about love that will make you laugh, cry and most important feel. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are incredible, I can't imagine a more perfect couple and their presence will remain in your mind and heart for a long time. Everything in this movie is so rich: acting, music, choreography, scenery, sentiment. The movie itself is a feast for the eyes and the music is perfectly combined with the scenes that accompanies. Baz Luhrmann has pushed musicals one step beyond. The whole film is grand and you can easily understand how much time, hard work and love was spent in every detail. Apart of its perfection the strength of the film comes from its powerful story, its theatrical feeling and the alchemy of Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mc Gregor. I feel that I can't really express the impact that this movie had on me, it's being a long time since a work of art moved me so much. Baz Luhrmann offers us a great gift, if you believe that there are things that can lift your spirit higher, shake you and awaken your heart and soul, this is one of them.</fullReview>

Why does Satine fall in love with Christian after just one song... Unrealistic..." Aaargh! I'm gonna direct this comment to those people: What are you, stupid?! When you heard the story of Romeo and Juliette for the first time, did you think "How unrealistic, they only know each other for two seconds and already they're in love."? It's supposed to be unrealistic, it's one of those dramatic love stories!Of course the story is simple, of course it's a corny, over the top musical with silly love songs in it and a predictable ending. That was the whole point! It's supposed to play on the human emotion in the easiest way there is; with music, dance and simple but beautiful lines. You have to enjoy the singing and the dancing, you have to smile when they get each other, you have to cry when she dies, you have to get goosebumps during the final of the tango/Roxanne, you have to be dazzled by the colours and costumes. It's a show, a wonderful, cheerful, uplifting, easy for the eye and ear show! If you want to see a good story, go see Memento or something like that, this movie you go and see to have an exciting time and nothing more. So stop whining about the story!</fullReview>

This film really is an experience. I found myself wrapped up in the fabulous performances, the incredible music, the romance and the bohemian idealism, escaping all to realise their dreams.This film really is outstanding. Imagine my horror when the landing at Johanesburg interupted the film with 20 minutes to go.

After seeing the video of the "Lady Marmalade" song, I was completely turned off to the notion of seeing the movie. I really liked the movie, and am very glad that I saw it on the big screen. In fact, I saw it as part of a friend's film class, and he said he was going to show the first three reels after his night class, and I went back to see the first part again. The first hour of that movie was one of the most spectacular things I have seen on film. I would urge anyone to see this movie. I will agree that it is not for everyone, but one may be surprised by it like I was. Since it is a musical, you have to give it a chance to be what it is. People don't break into song like that, but it works here, like all good musicals. It also goes from campy to serious to funny to sad, all in the space of a few minutes. Most films don't seems to do this effectively. This one does. Again, I would urge you to see it if you haven't already.</fullReview>

I wished I had believed the reviews and gone to see it in the theater. Hopefully one day they will rerelease it, for this is the kind of movie that would most likely be phenomenal on the big screen. Anyway, Moulin Rouge is breathtaking and ground breaking at the same time. It's not your traditional musical; often you can't even tell when the singing stops and the talking begins. There are many references to songs from the 20th century, which I enjoyed, in a comical way, hearing in this sense. The music and dance direction is wonderful. Each number is better than the last. And the movie doesn't stop there. In fact, after viewing the whole movie, this is not the major part I remember. The story, the script, the lyrics... they're all so beautiful. "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return". "This movie is about freedom, truth, beauty, and above all things, love." While these might seem cliche and corny, the way these ideas are presented are so that the viewer actually believes them. Last but not least, the characters of the film are great. I especially enjoyed Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge who defines the word thrifty. At some points it may seem like he is the antagonist, or one of them, but at most times he is on the side of good, of love. There's so much more about Moulin Rouge that's wonderful, but it would take the length of the script to write it all, if not more. Every line is wonderful, and to compound on that the acting, singing, dancing, editing, costumes... EVERYTHING is wonderful. So please, if you have not seen this movie, see it.And remember:The greatest thing You'll ever learn Is just to love And be loved In return</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning visuals, Disney story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The raves about this film all include reference to the fact that this film is a feast for the senses. And, visually, it is mighty impressive. Lavish set design and art direction (an Oscar must-win in this category) are the primary virtues of this film, and mark out its uniqueness. Other than that, though, you get a storyline that's not nearly as easy to appreciate, one that's been done time and time aplenty in a Disney movie (well, except for the ending). On the whole you get an above-average movie, worth viewing at least once (several times if you like the striking visuals), but I think one could come up with several other movies meriting consideration for best-film nominations before this one.But as to the visuals, it does raise the question: is this the most visually impressive movie ever? It's certainly among the most *impressive* ever, though I wouldn't categorize it as one of the most visually *beautiful* films ever. For that, I would nominate _Barry Lyndon_. It's a feast for the eyes, but like everything else Kubrick, it doesn't bombard you, as _Moulin Rouge!_ does. And the first 15 minutes or so of _Moulin Rouge!_ are just plain dizzying; there's no time to really take in anything in particular. This director hasn't had the best of track records with me; I literally gave up on _Strictly Ballroom_ about 30 minutes into it.Mainstream storyline + extraordinarily lush framing = 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best thing since Suspiria</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being an Australian movie in the year of Lord of the Rings, Moulin Rouge is my favourite recent movie. It's pure cinema, a melange of sight and sound, song and dance, tragedy and comedy and True Love as it only exists in the movies. Having two of the best actors in movies, Nicole Kidman and Jim Broadbent, doesn't hurt either.Moulin Rouge is pure spectacle in the manner of Dario Argento's 1978 horror movie Suspiria. Despite dealing with very different emotional sets, these two movies go together in my mind. They also fit nicely in the "love it or hate it" category. Baz Luhrmann's previous movies, Strictly Ballroom and Romeo + Juliet, were nice surprises for me; I expected each of them to be crap, but enjoyed both thoroughly. I ended up with high expectations for Moulin Rouge, and I was not disappointed. Toss your cynicism out the window and have fun with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent movie. I really thought this was more a musical than a movie, boy, i got it wrong. I liked all their songs and i liked this movie, although a secret is already revealed in the beginning that you're thinking of the entire movie. The actors and the decors are amazing, just like the camerawork, who acts like a crazy through the crowd at Moulin Rouge. The dressing by the actors was also nice done. The glamour is really sparkling at this movie. Buy or rent this movie if you like musicals and/or movies with quiet a story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I took this film in local videostore, I didn't expect it to wake the child in me. It took me in a whirlwind of emotions, from happiness to sadness, from wonder to amazement.. I like to compare these feelings with the time I watched 'Hair' for the first time. A breathtaking experience. I didn't sleep till 8 am 'cause I wanted to see the other DVD ( special features, etc. ) immediately after seeing the film. For me it is certainly one of the best films ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having believed that "The Lord of the Rings" should have won the oscar for best picture, I was surprised to find that "Moulin Rouge" was, actually, the better picture. Without reading any publicity about this movie, I had thought that it would be a typical musical centered on life at the Moulin Rouge in Paris. How wrong. This movie was more surrealistic than could be imagined. It played more as a colorful, crisply directed, film that would puts MTV musical videos to shame. Why this picture's director wasn't nominated for an award is beyond me. The story, a romance between a Bohemian writer and the theater's star attraction was poignant. Both stars play their rolls to perfection. Ms. Kidman was beautiful, more so than ever I realized. But, the true beauty of this production was in its rendering. A musical using both original songs and works by such writers as Elton John and Paul McCartney. It might not be for everyone. But for fans that enjoy the color and excitment of a beautifully crafted piece of work, this is it. An "art" film placed on the big screen. And, art it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just gets better with repeated viewing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's so much to like about this film, especially if you've got the 2-disc DVD. If it feels like none of the DVD extras and behind the scenes footage ever shows these people with their guard down, maybe it's because they're all so open-hearted on screen--there are some lovely images though, including costume fittings and makeup tests that look like works of art in and of themselves (plus a lot of extra scenes that make one think Luhrman could've cut this film six or seven different ways). Ewan McGregor gives a lovely, soaking wet performance as the strange, enchanted boy, Christian, and no one in recent cinema history has been quite so charming--and I don't mean a Tom Cruise-"Top Gun" kind of charm. McGregor is nothing short of winning in this role. Together with Kidman--excellent screen chemistry and a virtuoso performance--they're the most memorable screen team in ages as they traverse the emotional rollercoaster Luhrman has set out for them. All this plus Jim Broadbent in the scene-stealing role of Zigler and Luhrman's sheer genius (who else could turn The Police's Roxanne into a heart-stopping dance spectacle?). Deserved much better than it got at the Oscars but who cares about them anyway? By the third viewing you'll be hearing Elton John's Your Song very much the way it must've sounded in Luhrman's head. Whether your attention is on the amazing production design or all of Nicole's nipple shots, just keep watching it--it gets better and better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no idea why I like this movie. I hate musicals, I'm not big on romantic films, and I was never a big fan of Nicole Kidman, BUT this movie is hypnotic. Every word keeps me glued to my DVD player for repeated viewings and I have no idea why. The plot is simple, but the way it is done makes it so good. The concept of using the familiar (songs) to illustrate a point is really revolutionary and refreshing. I've had to fight off a lot of my friends who said that they absolutely hated this movie, but for me it will never grow old and it will always be one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that should have swept the board at the Oscars is ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge!From what I can gather reading other user responses on this site, this film very much divides audiences into black and white categories. You either love it or you loathe it. May I be so bold as to suggest that this is solid proof of a work of art? It leaves no one indifferent. I reside in the former category, that of love! (bordering on obsession if I'm honest) I saw this film five times at the cinema and would rate it as one of the greatest cinematic experiences I have ever had the privilege to partake of. Why did I love Moulin Rouge so much? Have you got a spare couple of days?:1 - Stunning, breathtaking visuals. So colourful and enchanting to look at.2 - Baz Luhrmann is a genius. There was not one moment in this film that he had not agonised over. I would like to have seen him presented with a 'Best Director' Oscar this year, as this man is gifted and deserves huge kudos. What a surprise that the academy once again opted for a conventional choice, and the outrage that Luhrmann was not even nominated! There is no way in this world that any of the nominees put as much heart and soul into their work as this man breathed into his. He is a phenomenon.3 - The music. Beautiful. There was not a piece of music or re working of a song in the entire film that I didn't like and I can only hope that Baz Luhrmann's film will help start a new era in getting musicals back onto our cinema screens. I'm sick of teen filcks I want to see more intelligent films like this one! 4 - The perfect balance of humour, surreal visuals and comedy with the tragic love story. Any film that can make you laugh and cry in equal measure has to be applauded. 5 - The Performances. First of all let me say how stunning Nicole Kidman is. She is captivating and reminds me of a screen Goddess from the golden age of cinema. Her voice is, granted, not west end musical standard but it is very, very capable and human sounding. Ewan McGregor is a star with a lovely boyish look about him and a Robbie Williams style singing voice. Both are fantastic, play their roles to perfection and have excellent chemistry together on screen. A delight to watch. The supporting cast are also excellent. I especially loved (the amazing) Jim Broadbent and Caroline O'Connor. I could go on and on, but I would like to put a theory forward as to why some are disliking this film. I honestly think that it is above the heads of the average member of the cinema going public, most of whom are accustomed to hi concept trash and popcorn films. Luhrmann's film is postmodern and unconventional - two factors which make it unnapealing to a popcorn movie crowd. Despite that, I do accept that even to individuals who 'get it', its dizzying pace and hypnotic look may still be too much. Overall, 'Moulin Rouge' is an acquired taste. For what my view is worth, I would rate it as one of the finest films ever made and the nearest I have ever been to a theatrical experience in a cinema building. Thank you Baz Lurhmann: you deserve every success. Thank you for daring to be bold, and daring to break new ground. Thank you for the passion that goes into every frame of your work. Thank you for your energy, your vitality and your dedication! Just a huge thank you really! The Academy need their heads examining for overlooking this masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge was surely a better film than Ron Howard's TV movie of the week weepie that eventually garnered a Best Picture Oscar in 2001 (A Beautiful Mind, in case you've blocked memories of THAT abomination out of your mind) and the fact that Baz Luhrmann failed to even secure a Best Director nomination in the face of such a low-grade 'true story' speaks volumes about the Academy.Lurhmann's film is a colourful swirl of song and dance, with Nicole Kidman giving a dazzling (and surprisingly good) performance as the doomed Satine, while Ewan McGregor acquits himself well as usual, even if neither of the lead actors can sing particularly well. That, however, is half the fun of Moulin Rouge -- where the characters break into song, the singing talents (or lack thereof) of the actors gives the re-modelled song numbers (Diamond Dogs, Children of the Revolution, Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend, Roxanne, Lady Marmalade, etc) a fun, almost spontaneous feel.It's a wonderfully inventive pastiche of the musical genre that deserves the recognition and success it received upon release. Lots of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The stuff of true &amp; brilliant cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is no movie. Moulin Rouge is an intoxicating, life-affirming, magical audio-visual experience. It's something which you'll likely never come across again, and if you aren't touched in some way by it, then you can't be human. Everything: the acting, the script, the cinematography, the music, the amount of wisdom and soul injected into it strikes chords with me that no other film has ever done (though "Almost Famous" isn't far off). It is a simply wondrous work of art. One of the things that most surprised me was the fact (stop the presses!) that Ewan McGregor - bless his soul - can sing! And not just an average singing voice: a real, powerful, Broadway-esque voice that goes perfectly with Nicole Kidman's (which is also excellent). This blend of vocal quality and evident chemistry between them is the pivot on which movie spins. The story is as deep and sumptuous as the music, giving Ewan &amp; Nicole's Christian &amp; Satine exactly the kind of canvas on which to weave their magic. On face value, Moulin Rouge is much more style than substance, and granted it is VERY colourful and visually spectacular - but the basis of the story is very emotional. The idea of these two completely different people - one a struggling &amp; penniless writer, the other an out-of-this-world underworld performer - is so well carried off that I couldn't help feeling a sense of reality to it. It seemed to me that they were real, and they were really in love. The kind of movie that breaks your heart (and you don't care, because it is so fantastic) and takes your breath away EVERY time you watch it, is one to be treasured. There really aren't enough words in the world to describe the sheer incredibility of a film that I for one am proud to say "Moulin Rouge is my all-time ultimate top-of-the-class favourite film ever, and I don't care who knows it" about. The performances, the score, the screenplay, the artistry - every one of Moulin Rouge's attributes is unique, and will probably never be equaled, let alone surpassed. It's a wonderful experience and one that I will love having over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But if you're open...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very unusual film, and certainly one that that many viewers will not even watch all the way through. It is also a shocking film, but not in the sense the word is generally used. There is very little in the way of explicit sex or violence, and the humor, while a far cry from the standard Hollywood fare, does not attempt to push the envelope of bad taste. Moulin Rouge! is shocking in that every aspect of its design, from the over-the-top acting, to the frenetic editing, to the lavish sets and the unconventional manner of telling the the story, is a spectacular departure from conventional filmaking. This is why so many people dislike it, but also why, for those who do enjoy it, repeated viewings are so rewarding. The more comfortable one becomes with the film, the better it seems. For my part, I was not sure what to think of Moulin Rouge! the first time I saw it, but I liked it enough to see it again, and I have seen it several times since. It is true that it is not for everyone, but I would encourage just about anyone to see it at least once. To use the words of the movie's male lead, played by Ewan McGregor, Moulin Rouge! "is very modern... and may feel a bit strange at first. But if you're open, I think you might enjoy it."</fullReview>

First of all, over 5,000 people vote for the Academy (hopefully the percentages of "renees" is as small as you ability to hold a rational thought), so 5,000 people aren't all screwed in the head, YOU ARE! Moving on, this was a movie to better all movies. Forget that it was the most entertaining film, if you actually WATCHED the whole movie, Nicole Kidman's acting in the end betters anyone. And Ewan McGregor's sadness is unbelievably convincing. Just think, if they had done the right thing by letting Nicole Kidman win the oscar, we could have been spared Halle Berry's minute-long niagra falls impression. (Okay, that's a little overboard. I'm happy for her, but for her to go on and on about she broke a barrier that was already done for her; maybe more black people would win if they started doing movies that required more range than "How High"). THis was an incredible movie with an incredible cast with an incredible director. END OF DISCUSSION.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie like a roller coaster - some might have to vomit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is best being described as .... a roller coaster movie. The audience is constantly drawn from one strong emotion into another, regardless of what has happened before. This is also the main flaw of the movie. Besides that, it has a great score that quotes from nearly all songs made in the last 50 years, a VERY fast pace, lovely colours, amazing special effects, costumes and brilliant acting... Some might not cope with the fast pace. Moulin Rouge is a good movie, but please, don't overrate it.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie an 8 because I'm convinced that I'd like it, at least, that much if I had been allowed to see it as it was supposed to have been seen. Unfortunately I ended up seeing it a very tired Sunday at 9 p.m. in a theater where the sound technician were either deaf, on dope or both.This movie is ... intense. Its imagery is intense as well as its sound. Therefore it became almost impossible to experience for me. On the other hand, I've never been much for musicals and Moulin Rouge is a musical on steroids. It's somewhat difficult to take the plot seriously when everybody's running around, singing everything. The scenes of the show at Moulin Rouge are almost tiring in their excessiveness.It's got humor, romance, music, sorrow and action but it misses at some point, trying to compress too much movie into too little space. Or maybe it's just that some songs are way too cheesy. Or maybe I'm just tired and grumpy. The point I'm trying to make is that, being such an intense film, you really need to have the perfect setting for it, or you will just not like it (like me).Oh, and one very big positive thing: They all actually sing their own songs. Without that the whole movie would just be laughable, at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bolero dancing lovers (could include some spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's can-can! Moulin Rouge bounces in the rhythm of director Baz Luhrman's heart. Man who woke us up in the mid-90's with his "Romeo and Juliet" adaptation has brought his new child of revolution into world after a few years of processing. Moulin Rouge is a bohemian musical and most of all love story. Ewan McGregor plays writer Christian who sings himself into parisian courtisan Satine's heart with such speed it makes your stomach whirl. Not the developing of the lovestory but the set it develops in. Pop art's most known remarks using set decoration and music make a positively psychedelic combination. From the first minutes to the last this story takes the viewer into a wishes-filled world of love, honour -and of course- paying fees. Luhrman's passion for music and dance is admiarable. He continues (in his own, original way) the legacy of 40's and 50's movies which musical numbers where filled with skilful coreographies and colourful costumes. The soundtrack is packed with hits from the latest decades (such as "Roxanne" and "show must go on") and all new music including the should-have-been-nominated-for-best-song-academy-award "Come What May".Kidman and McGregor's performances are great. Christian is filled with little-boy like enthusiasm which makes him lovable. And yes, he can sing. Kidman is, for the first time, actually likeable. Her Satine is emotional and clever woman to whom Cristian offers a chance of her life. The couple play greatly together which makes their "from love to despair" story enjoyable. Otherwise quite ordinary triangle love -theme get's new dimension by the colourful characters and visual setting. Jim Broadbent is father-like but business-wise Zidler and John Leguizamo makes small but important role as Tolouse Lautrec. Inspite of all things fast (and quite furious,too)Moulin Rouge succeeds in which it's supposed to: convince the viewer that the greatest thing is boundless love. All I needed was a happy ending!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is a movie unlike any other. It tells the simplest of stories in a most unsimple way. This movie is so original and so amazing, that is must be seen more than once to truly take in all of its greatness. It's a shame that the Academy went with the "been there, done that" A Beautiful Mind, and ignored the originality that is Moulin Rouge. Nicole Kidman is fantastic, and deserved the Oscar for this performance, which shows all of her range, from comedy, to singing, to heartbreaking drama. Ewan McGreggor is also very good, as is Jim Broadbent, who really won his Oscar for this performance, despite what movie he was nominated for. Moulin Rouge is a spectacular film that dared to be bold and original, and offer up something new and fresh to movie goers. It succeeded in giving us a movie that will be around for a long time. It's just a shame that as usual, when someone tries something different, the old guard stands up and shouts that they like things the way they are, and take every chance they get to bad mouth the new thing, and attempt to keep things the same. To you all I say too bad, because while there are lots of you out there, the majority has seen the light, and this movie is being embraced like none I've ever seen before. Its 8 Oscar nominations are a good indicator of that. To anyone who has not seen this movie, give it a chance, it may surprise you, as it did I, in the most spectacular spectacular of ways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when I sat down on my confortable chair that I could've ever imagined that this movie were going to be such a great "spectacular spectacular" as it is. First of all, I'd like to say that I've never been a fan of neither Ewan nor Nicole, but now I've realized that I have underestimated them. I was really astonished by the surprisingly great performance they made. My first impression when I saw and, above all, listen Ewan's "My gift is my song // and this one's for you", was that I, as Satine did, was going to fall in love with him. Later on I decided that they were the most enamoured couple in the world. Secondly I've gotta say that the Zidler's "Like A Virgin" has been, for me, one of the most funny times I've enjoyed in a since ever. And, what about the rest of the film?

They seem so perfectly cast, it is uncanny.Luhrman has embraced the technology and resources available today and the result is a masterpiece. The complexity of the this visual and audio extravaganza is so expertly forged that if you open your eyes, your ears and your mind it will grab you and pull you through its many layers to its loving heart.And THAT is what will stay with you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit it took a good half an hour for me to get into Moulin Rouge..but once the storyline got underway and I began to accept the bizzare format of the film I became entranced. For me the film has two major attractions, one being the songs, with Ewan Mcgregors fantastic, powerful voice, and the other being the overwhelming story of the love between Christian and Satine. I laughed and I cried, I even watched it again straight afterwards so that I could fully appreciate the first half hour that I had sat through the first time round thinking how dreadful it was-how wrong I could be. My advice to anyone who hasn't seen this film yet is to get it and watch it..but don't be put off the first part-stick it out and by the end you will be in love with Christian, Satine and the Moulin Rouge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Darn it.I used to be a movie lover. I loved most good films whether they were drama, romantic comedy, war, western...even musicals. I saw Moulin Rouge two weeks ago, on DVD. Last week, I rented Legally Blonde, a film I expected to enjoy. I didn't. I thought it was most unoriginal, unfunny, and a bore. The following day, I bought Moulin Rouge on DVD, and I've been watching it since...(without/with commentaries, behind the scenes stuff, choreography etc...there's a lot to get through!)I have a sinking feeling that I'm trapped in a world where the only movie I want to see is Moulin Rouge. Every film I've seen seems to pale in terms of the enjoyment factor. Honestly, it's like a drug! Despite the sad ending, every time, it seems to give me a high.Thanks a bunch, Baz, Nicole, Ewan and the rest of your accomplices, you have ruined my cinema-going forever. I'm off to find a "Moulin Rouge Anonymous" meeting.P.SMake it up to Baz for not getting a Best Director Nomination. Give it the Best Film Oscar...because we'll never see the likes of Moulin Rouge again. We'll have two more chances to see Lord of the Rings, and we've seen a Beautiful Mind several times before...Shine, My Left Foot, even Iris!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summary: I'm Exhausted! Fellini on Acid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I spent over 20 years in N.Y. in theater...predominately musicals. I love them. Always have. I was a director, choreographer and performer. I did not expect to like this movie. Modern songs in a 1909 setting!? How dare Baz Luhrman. How dare he indeed. What he did is prove that this country's few contributions to theater and film (the 'broadway' musical format) can translate to film...if you have a genius behind it. How sad that the nay sayers missed the impact. I think men hated it because (in this country) if you like a movie like Moulin Rouge...you're probably a 'fag'. These same people probably didn't 'get' Fellini, either. I know it didn't have a lot of gun-play, naked crotch shots or enormous effects you've seen over and over...BUT it did have a genius at the wheel. How does a mind come up with this? I would love to sneak into his dreams and just sit back and watch. The cinematography, the art direction, the costumes are mind-blowing. I played the Fiddler in Fiddler On The Roof for over two years...was at the opening night of A Chorus Line, A Little Night Music, Follies...and on and on. I went into this movie with a jaded chip on my shoulder and got it promptly knocked off. Don't rip yourself off by listening to the critics and friends who are oddly afraid to let themselves like this movie. GO! RENT! BUY! Hell...steal it. Just watch it with a loose a--hole for 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's allegorical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the first 15 minutes, my senses were assaulted. I was also taken aback by the use of popular song lyrics as dialogue. Then I finally got the point of the movie. It's not even remotely grounded in reality. It's "hyper-real" (Lurhman's own words). It's allegorical. The characters are deliberately archetypal.Relax, and give in to this feast for the senses, and you won't be disappointed.McGregor's ability to sing surprised me more than Kidman's. Personally, I think he did a better job singing, but both were quite good!Roxburgh's portrayal of the Duke is superbly comical. When he recites a couple of lines from "Like a Virgin", I was rolling on the floor. Compare this with his character in MI2. They are a wonderful contrast.My favorite part is when the song, "Roxanne," is given an awesome interpretation in some passionate Argentine Tango.The key is that the songs and lyrics-as-dialogue are wonderfully integrated into the movie, unlike a standard musical that stops for a song. This integration contributes to the film's good pacing. It's so refreshing to see popular songs used in original ways.</fullReview>

Also having recently bought it on DVD, it makes the transition from large to small screen very well.

		<fullReview>It took me a few showings, but I admit, it was pretty good. The first time I saw it, I was rolling my eyes and gagging during the fist minutes. But if you stick with it, you might be surprised.Many people here complain about the plot. Yes. It's overused and a bit weak. However, just about *ALL* the movies that Hollywood churns out are no exception either. A lot of the other musical movies out there weren't necessarily new and fresh either. While, without a doubt,it's not a musical masterpiece, it certainly is entertaining. This film simply takes the contrived love story, and puts a colorful, dizzying twist. While I still dislike some parts, the good parts were just worth sticking with Moulin Rouge! for the whole 2 and half hours.The bad points: *Smells Like Teen Spirit-- I loved that song.. and.. oh, it's just un-nerving to hear it done by anyone else then Nirvana.*Some of the weak plot points--oy.. I explained above*Nicole Kidman-- yes, she can sing better then I expected and can act.. but her portrayel of the overly used minxy, sobbing, terminally ill woman stuck in a serious emotional rut made me hate the stereotypical character even more.Good points: * The rest of the cast-- I think everyone else did the best with what they had. Jim Broadbent, John Leguizamo, Richard Roxburgh, Ewan McGregor (especially-- I was pleasently surpised)--ah, I think it was pretty top notch!*The Humor-- it was so off the wall and zany at times that I couldn't resist giving my kudos for that.*The Scenery-- wow... with that and the cinematography, I was dizzied and dazzled... like a major sugar high. I thought it was insanely cool, and was perfect!*Most of the songs-- It's quite funny, but two guys singing like a virgin, whilst waiters frolicked around did get me quite giddy. It was a bit of a parody on all those numbers in other musicals (think "I'm Gonna Like It Here" from Annie). Ewan's not the greatest singer, but I didn't expect him to be as good as he was. And I loved the use of Roxanne by the Police... who knew it'd seem so right for the movie!So..In short, if you can forgive it's flaws and try not to be some rigid little weiner who thinks he's smart if he analyzes and trashes a movie merely meant to entertain, then you may very well enjoy it for it's artistry and orginality (at least when compared to garbage that most studios push out). I certainly did! It's a shame that it is not as appreciated here in the states that it is in other places.Typical American Audiences to can something that's just different.</fullReview>

If you're a girl you are charmed by the smile of Ewan McGregor and if you're a guy you dive right into the eyes of Nicole Kidman. If you think they're ability to act is wonderful, they're singing is even better! I recommend you see the movie. If you don't like it the first time you see it, watch it again until you understand it. Nothing is greater than love, "Love is like Oxygen, all you need is love!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, here's the deal; I hate musicals! And I did hate this movie for that. I couldn't get through it in one sitting. Had to pause it and do something else now and then. But, I did manage to finish, and even though I don't like to admit it, i have to: Moulin rouge! is a very good movie. At least, that's how I felt after it was over. I loathed the singing bits while they occured, but looking back.... If this is not your kind of movie, chances are you will dislike it. But regardless, it may be worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laugh, Cry, Dance, or Sing Along; this movie makes you do all of them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an age of movies where the ending in each one is your typical boy meets girl, defeats villain, gets girl in the end, it is good to see a movie that tells a heart-felt story with a sad end. It also tells the story in a type of genre long thought dead and only used in Disney cartoons - a musical. This movie is colorful in every way, from the lovesick and love obsessed Christian and the courtisan/singer Satine to the amazing costumes. The cinematography in the movie was exquisite, my favorite use of the camera being near the beginning when you first enter the Moulin Rouge, it is used to make you feel disoriented, like Christian probably felt when he first entered the late 19th century version of Studio 54. In a movie about Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and Love, you feel all of it. The Truth - This movie is sensual, uplifting, a definite "Spectacular Spectacular." The Beauty - Every thing about the movie is beautiful, from the setting and time ( late 19th century, paris france during the bohemian revolution) to the people, costumes, music...need I say more. The Freedom - You will feel free as your entranced by this story about the lovesick Christian in his attempts to free his first love, Satine, from the grips of the evil duke. The Love - You will love to watch this movie over and over again. You will love to sing along with the characters in each of the amazing songs (Your Song, Elephant Medley, Come What May) You will love being able to share the movie and its story with your kids, grandkids and so forth. You will just flat out LOVE this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is a magnificent film that takes the viewer above and beyond the normal movie-going experience. So original, powerful, emotional, and exceptional, Moulin Rouge will grab hold of you and not let you go. Musical-haters won't help but at least like this one, for it's not your typical musical. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor truly define great acting and singing, and the production as a whole, what with the scenery, costuming, etc., will blow you away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a tricky plot that makes you think about it over and over again all night long, please rent a David Lynch movie and forget about Moulin Rouge. But if you are willing to give your eyes and your ears a brand new experience that will make everything else look and sound a bit dusty, this is the right movie. The simple plot which we can find in every classical opera involving an impossible love and some kind of nasty disease, has been enhanced up to the limit with incredibly luxurious settings, gorgeous costumes, a powerful soundtrack and an eye-striking editing. Moulin Rouge actually does not have any original content to offer - as said, the plot is so classical that it gets dangerously close to being naive, and in the soundtrack you will find only one original song, the others being elaborated covers to hits from the 70s, the 80s and the 90s - but this "nothing original" is presented to the audience in such a beautiful, witty, colorful, even redundant way that you cannot do anything but watch and be pulled into this fantastic world where nothing is important but Freedom, Beauty, Truth and Love. The Bohemian Revolution is here, and nothing will be the same again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Baz Luhrman's Moulin Rouge successfully resurrects the lost genre of musicals. It blends 1890's setting with music by Elton John, Christina Aguilera etc. And the result is stunning. Ewan McGreggor and Nicole Kidman have superb onscreen chemistry. The scenes are beautifully shot, the surrealistic glimpse of Paris providing an amazing real basis for this tale of forbidden love. Luhrman has been climbing his way up the musical ladder with Strictly Ballroom, Romeo + Juliet, and has succeeded admirably in this grand romantic epic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Lord! Spectacular!! (Some Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS*First of all, let me just say that Moulin Rouge has got to be one of the most original movies of 2001. I only recently brought the video in March 2002, but all the same I love it. As with most, I saw the trailer when it came out on cinema and shrugged it off as some Hollywood fad and ignored it. That was before I found out who directed it. BAZ LUHRMANN!!!!This man is truly a God amongst Directors. The cinematography and direction (Not to mention dialogue and humour) for this film gets top marks from me because Baz is my favourite director - I LOVED Romeo and Juliet.McGregor knocked me six ways from Sunday when he opened his mouth and belted out the romantic power ballad 'Your Song'. Everything just seemed to silence at that moment. (Baz knew this because the lights of Paris all lit up too) I couldn't find a fault with his voice at all, nor his acting. It was so much better and natural than his wooden performance in Episode I.Kidman did a nice job, though her voice took a little warming to. It's quite thin and high, but worked surprisingly well with Ewan's voice. She certainly did a good rendition of 'One Day I'll Fly Away' though I was more impressed with her 'Diamonds are a girl's best friend' and 'Come What May'. I was particularly impressed with Kidman's acting skills. I've never really watched any of her films, and was pleased to see she could switch from a raving loony prostitute to doing a good job and coughing and wheezing ? it sounded so real!Though the plot is straightforward and simple, Baz managed to make it something new and interesting in the best way he knows how; through pure and utter LUNACY. This was great. Baz certainly picked a clever way of introducing the co-stars ? A narcoleptic (of all things) Argentinean falling through his roof and a Dwarf with a unusually long name (dressed as a nun) running into his room, then all of a sudden he winds up helping them on a play. Genius.A simple, zany and tragic love story (slightly reminiscent of both Romeo and Juliet and Titanic) Baz has redefined the genre of musicals. The singing was up to par, the dancing was moving (no pun intended) and the songs chosen were as if they were secretly written for the film twenty or so years ago. Fantastic. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! What a "spectacular" experience! Ever since I first rented the movie two weeks ago, I have watched it seven times. I was simply amazed at the heightened reality of the film. While some think it is goofy, I thought it was great how the director, Baz Luhrman, could walk the viewer skillfully through such a wide variety of emotions- laughter, sadness, love, energy. The dance scenes, especially the tango scene, were truly a joy. I love the way the play and the dance scenes mirror what is happening to Christian and Satine. Also, casting was wonderful, and Nicole and Ewan's voices are perfect compliments. Also, John Leguizamo played an excellent Toulouse-Latrec, and Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh were a wonderful support team. The lighting was always perfect for each scene, and the use of color and movement, especially in the cancan dance, was simply magnificent. I think the fact that we see all these exaggerated actions and emotions in the movie simply adds to the truth, not takes away from the reality (which is what many close minded people would say). Furthermore, the use of previously composed songs did not bother me- in fact, it helped me relate to the movie more easily. I have never been touched so much by a movie. I give it a perfect 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am astounded at the range of reviews of this movie -- from `best ever' to `dismal failure.' Wow! I think one thing is certain; this movie is like no other I've ever seen, and I enjoyed it tremendously.One user-reviewer described it as formulaic, which couldn't be further from the truth in my opinion. Sure it's a tragic love story, and I suppose you could call that formulaic, but by that definition, 99% of films are equally so. The film is stunning in its creativity, its energy, its sheer spectacle. The blending of old and new in the sets, the costumes and the music were truly remarkable. I'm surprised no one has commented on the opening scene with John Leguizamo's Toulouse-Lautrec singing a melancholy song of lost innocence from high atop the famous Moulin Rouge windmill. This is one of the most memorable opening scenes in any movie, ever.The cynicism of the movie critics is understandable ? after all, they let others create while they stand off to the side and throw verbal darts. But for the rest of us, Luhrmann has created something unique and timeless with this film. When Hollywood seems to crank out the same-old-stuff over and over again, it is refreshing and immensely enjoyable to experience this film ? in all its wild extravagance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a little nervous about watching this movie when it first came out. But I did rent it just for kicks, and ended up loving it! I am in marching band at my high school, and our director chose the music from Moulin Rouge for next year's show. I was thrilled to hear the great news! I am very excited to find out what our show will end up looking like on the field next year! I can see why my band director chose this show for our marching band. Moulin Rouge consists of wild combinations of all different kinds of music. From artists like Christina A., Queen, Nirvana, Marilyn Monroe--everything! I'm afraid to use this cliche, but there is no other way to say it: "I laughed, I cried, it was all-around perfect!" I was very surprised to find myself enjoying the film. I even received it for my birthday! So, in conclusion, if you are kind of "iffy" on this movie--just go out and see it! It's without a doubt a ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a blockbuster, but a piece of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For starters, I love Moulin Rouge. It gets a 10.Moulin Rouge does *not* possess a very interesting story. It's trite. What's more, the foreshadowing of the plot is so blatant that "shadowing" is not really accurate. However, the movie is exceedingly artistic, and that is how it succeeds.By using a well-known story, the essence of which being classic although overused throughout history, Baz alleviates himself from having to concentrate on plot. The movie does not suffer from misunderstanding, from which many movies with intricate plot lines do. As a result, he is able to pour his efforts into *how* the story is told rather than *what* the story is. It is the means the artist employs, not his/her subject matter, that keeps art enduring over the years. This is the reason that I view it as one of the best movies ever created. Long after summer blockbusters and feel-good or PC critic-choices fade into the background, Moulin Rouge will still be memorable as a movie that pushed the limits, shattering illusions of how cinema and musicals should be created.The basic framework of the movie is highly original for film and highly artistic in itself: the echoing of drama with music, the direct links between dialogue and impending action (e.g. Zidler states they will rehearse tomorrow the scene when the "lovers are discovered" and promptly he discovers Christian and Satine's love affair), and the collage technique - pasting snippets from other compositions, both musical and cinematic. For those with a knowledge of 20th century music, Moulin Rouge has many artistic similarities with Luciano Berio's _Sinfonia_, the third movement.Layered on this framework is the acting, which is impeccable. The four main characters (Christian, Satine, Zidler, and the Duke) were cast perfectly, and their performances are interesting, fresh, and convincing. Nicole finally has chosen a role where she can really explore her talents, and in Moulin Rouge we can finally see why she is a big name actress. Richard Roxburgh and Jim Broadbent handily juggle their comic roles with their more serious characterizations. But Ewan's performance really takes the cake. His character is one, which, in practically every incarnation, is the annoying, hopelessly naive, nauseatingly optimistic boy-next-door. Yet, Ewan's performance is so genuine and fresh (yes, fresh!); I never once wished him ill. Ewan took a usually distasteful character and made him lovable.The sets and costumes were stunning and vibrant only when they needed to be. And Baz's use of sepia backgrounds produced wonderful contrasts throughout, but particularly in the second half of the movie. The lighting was used effectively to complement the mood of the scene, not simply to illuminate the set nor to establish the mood in its own right. The editing was also very effective. The quick cuts can be daunting, especially during the Can-Can sequence, but I believe they are used to great effect, allowing Baz to keep only the most convincing shots of a take. The performances of the actors can be contributed as much to Baz's editing as the actors themselves. In addition, there were unusual camera angles, which cast an atypical view of a scene. My favorite is the shot after Christian shouts at Toulouse to leave him alone. A typical shot would be a tight close-up to show intensity. But Baz instead shows Christian's entire body sitting rather lifeless in bed, which really illustrates Christian's true emotions - sadness, despair - rather than the quick and easy emotion of anger.In the end, Moulin Rouge is a work of art. Fruitful debate will stem not from it's plot, but rather from more academic discussions of it's technique and form - how the movie *reinvents* the Orphean myth rather than qualities of the myth itself. And for those that enjoy it, Moulin Rouge can be watched numerous times. There is so much detail and self-reference - especially some intriguing flash-forwards - that one can pick up on something new each viewing.As for advice, if you need an intriguing, suspenseful plot, you will probably not enjoy Moulin Rouge. If, however, you can enjoy a movie solely for its artistic qualities, I believe you will enjoy it. Nevertheless, I suggest that everyone view it at least once - if not twice to pick up things that one cannot notice the first time - because it is truly a movie different from anything else ever made.</fullReview>

However, I do wish Nicole Kidman the best of luck considering she totally deserves best actress with an absolutely stunning performance in Moulin Rouge, even better than The Others, she has really sprung into action in the last year and deserves one hell of a congratulations for it, what better with an oscar. This film makes love out to be fantastic and Hollywood and the audiences have been waiting for a romantic tragedy (Romeo and Juliet not quite right) for years and finally is delivered, screw Lord of the Rings, I may be British but Moulin Rouge has got more of a watchable storyline, shame that it is up against Lord of the Rings, which will probably run away with it this year at the oscars, any other year Moulin Rouge would be the best.

		<fullReview>"Moulin Rouge" is a spectacular film. I generally don't like musicals at all, but I really had fun with this film. It is expertly directed by Baz Lurmann, whose talents were unfortunately wasted in the overindulgent "Romeo and Juliet." He has made a film which lights up the screen almost from beginning to end (emphasis on almost - there are one or two relatively dark scenes).Lots of people didn't like "Moulin Rouge" because of the story, not only those who posted comments on the IMDb, but most of people I talked to personally about the film. Personally, I like the story, and I think that the extraordinary cast does a terrific job of acting it out. This film is full of energy, excitement, great music, great acting, and great fun. I gave it a 9/10. I recommend to everyone. If you don't like it, apparently you're not alone. If you do like it, however, then you're a real human being.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge hearkens back to a time when movies had the fresh feeling of adolescence, intoxicated by their own possibilities. It's a deliciously offbeat film, completely aware of its own audacity. Not only does it reestablish the movie musical with verve and sincerity, but it does so in a unique and defining way. By mixing turn-of-the-century and contemporary icons, the craziness of the Moulin Rouge is updated for today's desensitized viewers, giving us an idea of just how liberating and frightening it must have been to visit that infamous dance hall all those years ago. It really "Smells Like Teen Spirit."Christian (Ewan McGregor) comes to the Paris of 1899 an idealistic youth, searching for the materialization of his firm beliefs in truth, freedom, beauty, and love. Like a prodigal son he strays to the world of the Moulin Rouge, a decadent world of , , prostitution, and bohemian indulgence. It is there, through the frenetic tempo of extravagant sets and costumes, that he finds Satine (Nicole Kidman) a beautiful but jaded courtesan. Falling into a boyish infatuation, Christian confronts Satine, realizing his love, and her's in return. But their hope is dwindled, as Satine has sold her body in contract to the terrible Duke. Besides that, she is embittered with a horrible and ultimately tragic secret.The story is clichéd to be sure (it's similarities to Camille often make you wonder if writers weren't merely using an old cliché, but an old movie), but it seems to work, if only because of director Baz Luhrman's wholehearted belief in its values. He digs down into the deeply hidden heart of his story, replacing the dirt of a hundred cheap melodramas with a visual artistry unrivaled by anything in years. In this way it expresses the sincere, almost raw emotion these stories once contained in a completely new way. Did we say completely new way?!The visual artifice of Moulin Rouge is astoundingly fresh! It's painterly but kinetic in a way only a movie could be. The fabulous choreography, music, set design, performances... all blend to form a visual, aural, and emotional experience like no other! It has the Technicolor richness of a 50's Hollywood musical, but often the feel of a music video. The visual style ranges from somber pop-up book, to giddy cartoon, to lilting romantic dreamworld, to fantastic Bollywood production, and everything fits! That director Luhrman has managed to bring this all to the screen with such clarity is somewhat astonishing.But of course we could not write a review of Moulin Rouge without mentioning the bizarre choice of music. Luhrman has unusual confidence in his eccentricities. But then again who else could take "Roxanne" and turn it into a beautiful, , haunting tango? And who knew "Like a Virgin" as sung by Jim Broadbent could serve as a goosepimply, if ironically bitter, release?Of course it could also help that most of these songs are sung by the rapturous voices of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. Their performances are beautiful and sincere, particular Ewan's (that I feel the need to call him by his first name only proves how close to him I became). He becomes his role with unbelievable passion and heart. He has a bit of something that goes beyond acting, he has the magic of a great performance. He can embody youth, charming goofiness, and shattered idealist, and if he wasn't in love with Nicole Kidman! All this he expresses with an absolutely angelic singing voice (even its occasional weaknesses serve as charming strengths). You fall in love not only with him, but for him. The Academy not honoring him with at least a nomination would be a great disappointment.Nicole Kidman is both y and beautiful, like the film itself a daring blend of old and new. She's part 30's queen, part pop star, a little Marlene Dietrich, a little Madonna. When discussing Moulin Rouge I've found that many would not see it solely because Nicole was in it, and this is sad. Her performance here is excellent, displaying her full range of talents. She expresses her usual cool seductiveness, but also a surprising comic flair, and at times an aching emotion. And did we mention her singing? Like Ewan, Nicole has a hidden vocal talent. Her voice puts resounding meaning into something that was once just something dumb on the radio. Her efforts have resulted in numerous awards, including a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, and at least and Oscar nomination is certainly on its way.The way all these unique visuals, and performances are organized is also extremely unique. The editing style has been criticized as frenetic, and poorly structured, but I would have to disagree. If one watches this film carefully enough they with realize that each cut serves in the dance, by punctuating each note. This becomes most apparent in the previously mention Tango de Roxanne, one of the many brilliantly choreographed, grandiose dance numbers. As the momentum and emotion expressed by the dance and song builds, the editing follows, rapidly increasing in cuts until finally bursting like a heart overwhelmed by its own beating. Similarly, when Christian first enters the Moulin Rouge the frightening madness of it all is perfectly captured by Luhrman's crazed scissors.That Moulin Rouge has completely polarized critics is of no surprise. A large group of great films have done so, and I think this one is both a socially, and artistically important one. There are many who have called it a ridiculous piece of "pop trash." What these critics seem to forget is that Astaire and Rogers were the biggest pop icons of their era, and their stories were no more original. Ok, maybe Ewan and Nicole aren't exactly Fred and Ginger, but you get my point. Still it is exactly these critics who complain that American film studious never churn out anything original, and then turn to panning a film like this.But regardless of how anyone else sees it, I would call Moulin Rouge a great film, and doubtlessly my favorite of the year. It is easily deserving of awards in the majority of Oscar categories. Acting, editing, set and costume design, direction, everything is in its own way unique and beautiful. It may look like Busby Berkeley on acid, but beneath the extravagance is a beating emotion. In a film industry ted by cynicism, it is relieving to find a movie that dares to be sincere. Say what you will, but this Oscar season I'll be rooting for the most opulent, energetic, emotional, beautiful, brilliant, audacious movie of the year. Moulin Rouge anyone?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just re-watched "Moulin Rouge!" on DVD and my foot is still tapping along to it. It's a wonderful, fantastic, sensation trip - an extreme triumph of style over substance, that lives on in my head where most movies fade to nothing.One of the main criticisms leveled at the movie is a lack of a plot. Yup, I'll concede that. I'll furthermore add that it doesn't *matter*. It's a simple romance story - a very simple one - told with all the passion and vibrancy of love.What's good about the movie, if the plot isn't great? Everything else. Firstly fire the Academy - Luhrman deserves, at the very least, an Oscar nomination for Best Director his work here. "Moulin Rouge!" looks absolutely *gorgeous*. It's lush, vibrant, almost drowning you visually. The costumes, pseudo-periodic, are brilliant. The set of the "Moulin Rouge" is fantastic and lavish. The city of Paris is done with a tint of larger-than-life, almost cartoonish feel, reflecting the fact this is a *musical* not a drama. And then we add Luhrman's use of zooming cameras, high-paced editing, cameras that swirl around with the dancers... I could go on. It's sufficient to say that the movie will leave you breathless.The acting is top-notch, for what's needed. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman show untapped vocal skills, as do the rest of the characters. Sure they're not deeply etched, but a lot of the emotion is conveyed through song - as musicals are meant to do. The Evil Duke - who wants Nicole Kidman's Satine character for himself - is played almost camply with delicious glee by Richard Roxburgh. All of the cast, including the talented Jim Broadbent as the owner of the eponymous nightclub, credit themselves here.Finally of course there's the song. They're nearly all great. Blending a mix of old and new, sung to different tunes they can make you sad or make you just laugh out loud (check out "Like a Virgin"). You may deduct marks for originality, but you have to give the mark back when you can see the creative interpretations of the song.Does "Moulin Rouge!" have any faults? Sure, the plot's a little tripe and the pacing of the movie sags somewhat in the middle, particularly after the adrenaline pumping introduction of the Moulin Rouge (which will forever ruin "Smells Like Teen Spirit"). But the film's vigour, passion, intensity, its medley of music and sumptuous scenery lifts it far above it's flaws. Extremely recommended. 9.6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any filmmaker that can reinvent a tired genre, bring new magic to the screen and to the hearts of a younger generation, deserves kudos. Baz Luhrman is this man - although we should not forget his fantastic crew and talented production heads (as well as focus-puller). It goes to show that even in way down-under in Australia (I am half-Australian), far, far from Hollywood, it is possible to do world-class imaginative features, developed, produced, and edited in Australia (Lord of the Rings supports the same supposition in New Zeland). Nicole Kidman is brilliant, as is the set design and the costumes. Nothing, however, outshines the brilliance of the screenplay (Craig Pearce, Baz Luhrman), which magnificently weaves music throughout the ages in through it's classic comic tragedy storyline.Congratulations!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over substance - what's wrong with that?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Moulin Rouge three days ago for the first time, on DVD, and apart from the film, the DVD is very much worth seeing - buying even!You may guess from that comment, that I loved it. 3 days later, I'm still left with a warm glow. The film is unashamedly about love, and I can understand many people hating it, because it's not a substantive film, like perhaps "A Beautiful Mind". To me, its the opposite of that film, where you are perhaps led to believe that you a fly on the wall of the life of Nash. Moulin Rouge is about being aware that this is fiction, that these characters aren't real, and showing an idyllic form of love that perhaps everyone should strive for, even if we can never reach it. The Moulin Rouge was a nightclub, and even today when we go to a nightclub, in a sense, its about leaving the real world behind, having a few drinks, dancing like maniacs, and maybe even finding love. Nightclubs are not about substance; they're about leaving substance behind.The film is pure entertainment, a feast for the eyes, ears and heart, not for the brain. The frenetic pace, the colour, the familiar and sentimental love songs, the fantasy characters and the comedy which is absolute farce, make this film a unique experience. The audience is asked to sit back and enjoy, without really trying to preach or teach you anything. It demonstrates that film can be pure art, like a painting or music or dance, with no other agenda but to lift you out of the mundane ordinariness of life.Congratulations to Baz Luhrmann for getting this film made, in an era where superficiality can be frowned upon, and films must fall into a category dictated by marketing people. Congratulations to Baz Luhrmann for casting Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, who were intelligent enough to see what he was trying to achieve, and going out on a limb with him to achieve it. Congratulations to Baz Luhrmann for his originality, bravery and vision in avoiding formulaic or so called "worthy" film-making. He has proved himself a visionary before, and he proves it again with Moulin Rouge. It is a shame that the Academy have not acknowledged him this year, because surely this was a directing triumph. I suspect that Moulin Rouge will go home empty handed from the Oscars, but that is an indictment of Hollywood, not of this great film. It is not only the best film of 2002, but probably the best film of the past ten years.Nicole Kidman was incredible in her perfectly judged over the top performance, as was Ewan McGregor for his wide-eyed innocence and purity. And the singing? Brilliant. They looked like two people utterly in love, and gave those old love songs a depth of meaning that they never had before.Maybe I'm shallow, but I'll take Baz Luhrmann's style over Ron Howard's substance any day of the week.Ten out of Ten!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love...."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie about love. Above all things, the one emotion we all long for is to love someone, and be loved in return. This movie showcases it powerfully, with humor and a type of grace that leaves you wanting more long after it is over. Ewan Mcgregor is introduced first, and the first ten minutes, I couldn't help but keep a smile on my face. The sound effects and the camera angles made it entertaining to watch, and this is what I expected for the whole film.Yet, as soon as Christian breaks into song for Satine for the first time, I knew I had found something much more than just a musical. Mcgregor has a wonderful voice, and along with Nicole Kidman, is one of the more talented actors I've seen in a while. It is still sort of shocking that the singing was done entirely by the leading characters. The ending had me tearing up, and crying along with Christian for what happens. This movie is so much more than a musical. And I'm a little upset Ewan Mcgregor wasn't nominated for an Oscar, for he portrayed Christian with much emotion. This movie is a wonderful see, not just because of the colorful costumes, songs, and dancing. But also for the one emotion we hope to once experience in our lives: love. Highly recommended.

		<fullReview>Sloppy? Sure. Over-edited? Maybe. Bad movie? No way.First off, this film might have reestablished the movie musical as a bankable genre. So kudos for that. Why do I love this movie? Because it nearly brought me to tears at the end. There we see a director not afraid to allow a character cry. In a lot of films, when somebody dies, there is a little reaction from the loved ones, and typically a montage of moments when the main character is saying goodbye. You know, leaning on the railing of a bridge with that sad "missing you" type face.Ewan just cries his eyes out. And,I almost did too.Ok, enough about giving away the ending (which is told to you at the beginning anyway). This film starts off on a weird foot, making it seem like art-house fare. I thought, about ten minutes into it, that I was seeing the next Rocky Horror Picture Show. When Ewan belts out Elton John's Your Song, the film proves it is gonna be around for a very long time in a very mass-appeal sort of way.Who could resist that song? It is so good! Then, we are immediately enchanted with the comic misunderstandings of the evil Duke, the penniless writer Ewan, and Nicole as the gorgeous courtesan. This movies is really cool. Nuff said, buy your own copy. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... because I cannot imagine feeling neutral about this film. I happened to love it, although I admit that it took me fifteen to twenty minutes to adjust to its frenetic pacing, its farcical tone, and its fanciful melodramatic presentation. 'Moulin Rouge!' is a film to contend with; its images are sometimes spectacularly beautiful, at other times dark and nightmarish. It looks like one or all of the following could have directed it: Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, Orson Welles, and Bob Fosse. Set in 1899 in the Montemarte section of Paris, during the rise of the bohemian movement and awash with colorful characters, savory and unsavory, 'Moulin Rouge!' is the retelling of the famous 'Camille' story (a.k.a. 'La Boheme', a.k.a. 'Rent'). At the heart of the famous Moulin Rouge nightclub is the fabulous Satine, a courtesan of unbelievable beauty and renown, performed with lusty opulence by Nicole Kidman. Satine is being pursued by two men--a rich and worldly Duke, played by Richard Roxburgh, who all but twirls his moustache around his finger as evil epitomized; and by Christian, a na?ve and penniless writer, played in a winning performance by Ewan McGregor, who instantly gains the audience's empathy with his large and expressive, aquatic eyes. Satine needs the financial backing that the Duke can provide to assist her in becoming a real actress, but falls in love with Christian, who captures her heart with his simplicity and his idealized concept of love. Early on the audience learns that Satine is consumptive, thus setting the stage for light farce transfiguring itself into rich tragedy. The costumes are wildly extravagant and gorgeous; the sets sensual and voluptuous--fantastical buildings and exquisite skylines that, at first glance, look as if they were conceived by a psychopathic drag queen on a hit of acid. But the backdrops are in themselves necessary characters to this eye filling production. The songs--most of which will be familiar to the MTV generation--are magnificently arranged and are given new meaning by their context in the movie; you will never hear them quite the same way again. McGregor's surprising vocal talent--at times a soft and delicate delivery, at other times surging and strong--gives new life to Elton John's 'This Is Your Song'. It is a scene as joyful and uplifting as watching Gene Kelly singing and dancing in street puddles in 'Singing in the Rain'. Kidman's voice is a bit thin and breathy, but she more than compensates for it with her astonishing abilities as an actor, and is delightful in the clever combination of 'Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend' and 'A Material Girl'. A Carmenesque, flamenco-stylized version of The Police's 'Roxanne' is dangerous and spine tingling. Perhaps the most outrageous treatment of our recent pop past is of Madonna's 'Like A Virgin'; it is reminiscent of the title scene from 'Hello Dolly!', hilariously overblown, complete with dancing and singing waiters. Like I said, this film isn't for everyone. Many will be put off by the apparent overacting of the cast, misunderstanding the intentional quality of melodrama that is inherent in the concept of the overall piece, and by its lavish cacophony which gives the film its carnival-like feel. It is, in the end, a beautifully realized, intentionally bohemian enactment of an oft-told bohemian tale--at its core is the movement's motto: 'Truth, Beauty, Freedom, Love.' Who could ask for anything more? A triumph.</fullReview>

This should be said: this is not a movie about plot, acting, or special effects (although it does all these magnificently). This is about raw human emotion. Watch Moulin Rouge, and you'll feel like you're dreaming. I was sad to wake up. The plot is simple, but I didn't care. (I love how people hate movies like these, and then go watch a teen sex comedy.) The acting was terrific: you can tell these people are having the time of their lives. I own the DVD, and watching some behind-the-scenes footage, I only wished I could be there too. The singing voices of Ewan and Nicole are outstanding: they put all the famous songs into a new light. I love, love, love all the music. The design of the whole film was fabulous. I can never get enough of this. There is so much more I could say, but I don't have enough words to say it. Just go rent it, please. And if you don't like it, go rent that teen sex comedy.

This is a new age movie set in old times, yet it squeezes your heart and makes you want to get up and sing. It takes you on an adventure that no other film could possibly match up to. Moulin Rouge is a wonderful mix of comedy and love, but it is mostly about the deep love that kepps the two main characters, Satine and Christian, bound together despite the odds. Nicole Kidman is getting every ounce of recognition she deserves for her leading role, but I feel that Ewan McGregor is getting cheated for his spectacular performance. If anything he should have received the award for Best Actor In a Musical Or Comedy at the Golden Globes. Moulin Rouge should have gotten more attention than A Beautiful Mind, and all Moulin Rouge fans know it. THis film is a feast for the eyes and an opener of the soul.

		<shortDescription>The Brilliance of Moulin Rouge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge has to be one of the greatest films of all time, if not the year. Dazzling you with incredible editing and brilliant effects shots, it captures your attention and won't let go until the end. It takes you on a journey of true love and leaves you wanting more. Moulin Rouge begins with the once naive Christian (Ewan McGregor) sitting down at his typewriter to tell his story. He begins with how he came to Paris to write and live a penniless existence. And is then greeted by an unconscious Argentinian falling through his roof. "And is quickly joined by a dwarf dressed as a nun." Talous La Trec. Talous introduces him to the Bohemian lifestyle and gets him his first job in Paris...writing "Spectacular, Spectacular". Satine ( Nicole Kidman) the "Sparkling Diamond" mistakes Christian for the duke and falls in love with him. But she is a courtesan and isn't suppose to fall in love with anyone, except the duke, who is financing the conversion of the Moulin Rouge "into a theater". Satine is supposed to be his. Christian and Satine have to hide their love from the duke. But like any forbidden love, they are found out. The duke forbids her to see Christian or he will be killed. So Satine makes Christian believe she doesn't love him to protect him from the duke. Okay that's as far as I'm going to go. I don't want to give away the ending. If you want to know, go see it. I have to tell that I was swept up in this film. I saw it six times in the theater in a time when I couldn't afford to see one movie let alone it six times.

		<shortDescription>The Brilliance of Moulin Rouge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge has to be one of the greatest films of all time, if not the year. Dazzling you with incredible editing and brilliant effects shots, it captures your attention and won't let go until the end. It takes you on a journey of true love and leaves you wanting more. Moulin Rouge begins with the once naive Christian (Ewan McGregor) sitting down at his typewriter to tell his story. He begins with how he came to Paris to write and live a penniless existence. And is then greeted by an unconscious Argentinian falling through his roof. "And is quickly joined by a dwarf dressed as a nun." Talous La Trec. Talous introduces him to the Bohemian lifestyle and gets him his first job in Paris...writing "Spectacular, Spectacular". Satine ( Nicole Kidman) the "Sparkling Diamond" mistakes Christian for the duke and falls in love with him. But she is a courtesan and isn't suppose to fall in love with anyone, except the duke, who is financing the conversion of the Moulin Rouge "into a theater". Satine is supposed to be his. Christian and Satine have to hide their love from the duke. But like any forbidden love, they are found out. The duke forbids her to see Christian or he will be killed. So Satine makes Christian believe she doesn't love him to protect him from the duke. Okay that's as far as I'm going to go. I don't want to give away the ending. If you want to know, go see it. I have to tell that I was swept up in this film. I saw it six times in the theater in a time when I couldn't afford to see one movie let alone it six times. I had to choose between eating and seeing this movie and I chose this movie. That's how powerful it was. It is beyond anything else I've seen all year and I've seen alot. The musical score is fabulous. Ewan McGregor, although always one of my favorites, went beyond what I thought possible for him. (And should have been nominated for an oscar, but was passed over) And Nicole Kidman, never one of my favorites, showed me that she too can act just as well as anyone and is quickly becoming one of my favorites.

		<shortDescription>Dizzying kaleidoscope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For lovers of the musical theater (a purer venue for musical plays than film), the PR for Moulin Rouge was very tempting, especially given the calliope of popular songs featured in the soundtrack. Viewed on the small screen (as I did), it no doubt lost some of its dazzling effectiveness, but I think if I'd seen it in a movie theater I might have become uncomfortably dizzy. The production is almost blindingly colorful and there is so much going on visually that it is hard to take it all in. It is a jangling jumble of many parts--circus sideshow, fantasy, romance, dark comedy, and burlesque. It's as if Baz Luhrmann made every movie he's ever wanted to make, all in one.The performances were fine, however, and there were plenty of compelling moments. The sweet singing voices of both Satine (Nicole Kidman) and Christian (Ewan McGregor) were the biggest surprise. Unfortunately, I didn't really feel their chemistry and the contrast between their mutual love and their disdain for the bad duke (Richard Roxburgh) could have been drawn more clearly for better dramatic effect. Jim Broadbent--who played the conflicted Zidler, proprietor of the Moulin Rouge--of all the actors, seemed to grasp the need for a bigger-than-life performance. John Leguizamo, a wonderful character actor, had too little to do as Toulouse-Lautrec.The movie only partly worked, and it was the basic innocence and universality of the appealing story that saved it from finally exploding like an ambitious science experiment with too many ingredients.</fullReview>

The acting is adequate, the singing and dancing are impressively staged but this film is almost unbearable to sit through and holds no interest or surprises.

		<fullReview>The fact that this materialistic, fabricated formulation is on the greatest movies of all time list is simply absurd. Baz Luhrmann has proven himself to be one of the greatest cinematic hack-manipulators in recent Hollywood History. Riding on the banner that Moulin Rouge is a "brave and highly orginal love story that revamps the Musical genre at the same time" pushed even critics to abandon their heads, and ignore the unfeeling and senseless music video direction, and unorginal songs that clashed with the film's setting, timeframe and design. By all means, I'm not trying to sound conservative here, but the fact that is this film is "groundbreaking" on any level is just insipid. IT WAS NOT EVEN THE BEST MUSICAL of the year (and Critics are right, they don't make many). Don't believe me, watch John Cameron Mitchell's "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" which adds real depth, feeling, and patient, calculated and real Direction. Everything that Luhrmann's 130 Minute Music Video lacks (which was also done on a budget 12 times larger than "Hedwig's"). Every song in Mitchell's film is orginal too. Nuff' Said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Say there is a painting in a gallery that is worth $1,000,000. Art critics, my friends, other people go on and on about how great this painting is. I am excited to go to the gallery and see it. I go, look at the painting, and am shocked that I don't see the triumph that others talk about. I see a grotesque thing. Are the people who think the painting is great wrong? Definitely not. Am I wrong for being in the minority of dissenters who wouldn't hang this painting in my house even if it was free? No.I believe movies are both art and craft. All art has a different influence on and meaning for each individual who views it.In short, I severely disliked Moulin Rouge. I will never view it again.Am I uneducated, mislead, stupid, etc.? No, and neither are those many of you who loved this movie.Do I need to consult source material (Orpheus or other literature recommended in previous reviews) and "educate" my ignorant self? No. Will consulting other material make me miraculously love this film? No. I don't think one needs to have studied "The Odyssey" to enjoy "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?".I was on a date in an art museum once and my date hated a painting that was by my favorite artist (not Toulouse-Latrec :-)). I asked my date, was there at least something about the painting, anything at all, he liked? He came up with the brilliant answer: "Pretty colors."On a similar note, there were two things I liked about this film. (1) The "Roxanne" number. I will never think of the song in the same way again. (2) Ewan McGregor. I've liked him in everything he has been in. He did a valiant job in this role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Waste!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt about it: This movie is gorgeous. But all the fancy director's tricks, the magnificant sets and costumes, the splendid screen presence and chemistry of its main characters and Ewan McGregor's voice can't mask a weak script, little character development, and very little good music to call its own. (I mean, if you're going to rip-off someone else's hits, make sure you can do them one better.) This is strictly eye candy. Not only is much of the music awful (we were laughing hysterically for a couple of days as we sang a few words from one of them at my house), but also the choreography is uninspiring (just take a few looks at "Singin' In The Rain".) The one fine, original song was the ensemble piece sung when the cast was trying to sell its production to the buyer. As a long-time fan of musicals, I was disappointed and even angry at the waste of talent in this film. No doubt about it: The best film musicals of the past decade or so have been Disney-animated films. Just on the basis of music alone, this falls far short of the high standards set by Howard Ashman (may he rest in peace), Alan Mencken, Tim Rice, and Elton John. Want to enjoy Moulin Rouge? Then turn off the sound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing this after all the hype had gone down - the moment you see the conductor over-enthusiastically going along with the 20th Century Fox theme you know 'this is going to be silly'. The rapid visuals can be startling and quite amazing at times (although the speed is hard to take in on one viewing). The songs in the main are well-chosen - Your Song, Roxanne, One Day I'll Fly Away, Like a Virgin, Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend - and well-performed. I particularly like the way several sequences draw on other films and the way they were shot. McGregor and Kidman are the performances you'll remember, although Jim Broadbent was fun. A film of odd great moments (and an awful lot of, well, awful ones). Something a bit too busy to want to see too often, and I think it will fare badly on TV. Not the best film ever (and not Luhrmann's best either, Romeo and Juliet came out better) but not bad. Interesting. And definitely *very* weird.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both "old-fashioned cinema" and ultra-modern film-making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been said many times (here at this comments board as well as other places) that MR is one of those films you either love or hate. There is no real 'middle of the road' option here. For that reason alone, any serious film buff should watch it and make up his/her own mind. Take it or leave it - MR is an important film.Personally I took one long look at it. And another long look. And yet another. I was brought up watching classic MGM musicals as well as MTV. I may well be the target audience. MR's synthesis of old-fashioned musical magic (just note the ensemble work of the "Spectacular, Spectacular" scene) and what some critics have called 'postmodernism' (such as the Bollywood-meets-Marilyn Monroe scene) works for me. It truly does work even if the film sounds absolutely nuts on paper.Visually it is a feast. I cannot remember the last time I have seen such a beautiful, well-designed film. Aurally it is a feast too - I'm not going to give away all the delightful musical references, but some very inspired montages made me simultaneously laugh and gawk.However, the main reason it works so well is because of the actors. Nicole Kidman has been singled out in many reviews - and she is excellent and manages to lose her Icy Queen demeanour - but the film is an ensemble piece. Every tiny part is cast to perfection - at first I was admittedly not sure about the villaineous Duke, but I suddenly realised he was a sinister version of Cecil Vyse of "A Room with a View". It made perfect sense. Still, I do feel the need to single out Ewan McGregor. Baz Luhrman has described McGregor as an injection of warm blood into the film. It is easy to tell. McGregor is clearly having the time of his life dancing and singing his heart out. t puts a huge smile on my face.Usually I'm reluctant to give high praise to films - but to me, MR was a clearcut 10. It is a homage to the possibilities of cinema, it is a good-spirited celebration of The All Good Things In Life and finally it is simply just a fantastic film. But go see it for yourself and make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a depressing indictment of Hollywood that a film such as MOULIN ROUGE is apparently considered to be one of the best films to emerge from Tinseltown in recent years. Visually it is certainly fantastic, and - assuming your taste is very much in the mainstream - it must have value in purely musical terms. But it is also a soulless and in my mind rather cynical film, and one that demonstrates contempt for many fundamentals of good cinema.The cinematographer, choreographer, special effects team and so on should all be congratulated for some dazzling work. Indeed I'm sure many of these people will be nominated for Oscars. And so they should be. However the plaudits should end there.Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't it customary for a fictional film drama (whether musical or otherwise) to have a story and/or some characters? MOULIN ROUGE's lame excuse for a "story" is in fact revealed in a Ewan McGregor voice-over in the first reel of the film. There are no twists, no surprises, no sub-plots...in short it is feebly, depressingly, almost mind-numbingly predictable from first minute to last. Characterization fares no better, with no hint of personality detectable in any of the protagonists (the Duke comes closest by at least being a caricature - MacGregor, Kidman, etc don't even get that). This is truly one of the most lazily written films I have ever seen.Of course it could be quite reasonably argued that the very same criticism could be leveled at all sorts of films, and that is true enough. However MOULIN ROUGE has the breathtaking temerity to purport to be about "truth, beauty, freedom, love". It could not have chosen grander themes, and could not have made a more pitiful attempt at exploring them. In fact the film is so wretchedly written that at absolutely no point does it ever, even once, make a sincere effort to engage the audience on an emotional or intellectual level. Of course the renditions of 'Your Song' might have brought a tear to the eye to some, but if so then the credit is due entirely to Elton John, and no more due to Baz Luhrmann than it is to a radio DJ who plays it on Heart FM or whatever. The great musicals, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, TOP HAT and so on did actually bother with an involving and emotive screenplay between numbers. CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG had more of a script than this.MOULIN ROUGE is the product of someone being given a lot of money to make a big crowd-pleasing movie, and him making it without actually having anything whatsoever to say. To me a great cinematic spectacle comes from having an idea and building a film around it; not from hiring some big stars, spending the GDP of a small country on SFX, and then rather grudgingly putting a story and some characters in it as an afterthought.If you are attuned to its humour then I can see how this could be a fun movie to watch, but if you expect something more than an extended MTV video for your time and money, it's a wearying and ultimately rather insulting film. MOULIN ROUGE isn't - even for one second - about truth, beauty, freedom, or love. It's about making as much money as possible for the people behind it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few days before seeing the movie, I watched Baz Luhrmann selling the film in Cannes and all over the States thanks to a BBC documentary. I was sold on the film just from seeing an army of suited guys giving an operatic rendition of Smells Like Teen Spirit - and that's not even one per cent of this film's brilliance.In perhaps the bleakest year for big screen offerings, MR is one of the most welcome movies of 2001. A treat to look at, fast, funny, daring, sexy, rousing, exciting - everything a good movie should be. But if the set design and music weren't there, then it would still have worked purely because of the chemistry between Nicole and Ewan. They look like they're having fun which is worth the price of admission alone.An instant masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i hated this movie. cliched, sentimental drivel. bad music, with the exception of the use of madonna's "like a virgin," bowie's "heroes" and elton john's "your song", which was unfortunately ruined by it's incessant use in the film. the music for luhrmann's "romeo and juliet" was infinitely superior.ewan macgregor tries his best, but can't save the overly sentimental pap of the script.however, i was impressed by the scene in which zidler sings "like a virgin" to the duke. i found the gender-reversal of this scene to be original and entertaining, in stark contrast to the remainder of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, where do I begin.I hated this movie. Trying to sum up quickly what I didn't like isn't going to be easy. Let's start with the plot: I've seen Shakespeare in Love, so why watch an almost identical story about unrequitable love in the theatre?Especially one as predictable as this.The Editing: Fast and messy, with absolutely no finesse. I thought the camera movements and cuts would relate in some way to the tempo and flow of the songs, but instead we are treated to random zooms, spins and 50 cuts a minute until we feel (or at least I did) rather unwell.The Songs: What a heavy handed use of pop songs. A song about a prostitute? Oh, lets use Roxanne. In the name of love, Like a virgin, all you need is love, all too predictable. I was hoping for a really clever use of a song to make us see it in a different way. For me, the only tune that achieved that was 'Your Song' by Elton John. Unfortunately, this tune appeared during the most embarrasing scene of the movie.The Arrangements: This for me is where the movie really failed. Every song (bar Roxanne, which was brilliantly done) received EXACTLY the same treatment. That is, each number would start with a few spoken words, which would then progress slowly (oh, so slowly) into tune. then some strings or a keyboard comes in and the tune picks up pace a bit. Building to a crescendo of huge orchestral accompaniment and high pitched screeching and then...silence. The music stops and our star quietly sings the last line. Again and again. The unoriginal arrangement is hindered further by the fact that we already know all the words, so while the stars are plodding along we are already a verse and a chorus ahead, waiting for them to catch up. I HATED what they did with the songs in this movie.The Choreography: Average. I liked the Indian dancing at the end, but there wasn't enough of it shown. The Dancing during Like a virgin and especially the scene with the Duke in the Elephant were excrutiating.The Stars: Nicole Kidman was fantastic, with a solid voice. But Ewan Macgregor, Jim Broadbent, John Leguizamo &amp; especially the Duke fellow were all awful.The Directing: On the whole, fairly solid. The movie certainly had fantastic production values. However, the one thing that really grated me was Baz's use of a slow motion strobe effect to convey moments of drama. This technique worked best in Strictly Ballroom when our hero came sliding onto the dancefloor on his knees in the finale. It really hit you in the gut. But in Moulin Rouge we see the same trick every time Nicole had a little cough. Or when we saw the bad guy, or indeed in any moment of 'high drama'. This seriously diluted the desired punch and became way too repetitive. Also, using the exact same zooms and pans every time we go from Exans hotel room to the Moulin Rouge becomes so very tedious.Now you may have read this thinking that this movie is just not to my taste, but you'd be wrong. I loved Strictly Ballroom, Shakespeare in Love, Rocky Horror picture show, Priscilla Queen of the Desert, The Red Shoes, My Fair Lady etc. etc. I have nothing against musicals, or kitsch movies or any of that. On top of all this I was really looking forward to the movie. I just cannot praise a musical with badly sung, badly arranged &amp; badly filmed tunes, that has a plot stolen from any number of other romantic drama/comedies and does absolutely nothing new with it except sprinkle on a bit of glitter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I left the theater feeling like I had seen The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Pee Wee's Playhouse, the Marx Brothers' Duck Soup, and MTV -- all at once. Needless to say, such an amalgam was sometimes disconcerting. In fact, that combination was too much for the film to carry; it often failed to come together.References to songs of different eras seemed silly at first but grew on me as the movie progressed. (One must ignore dozens of anachronisms if one is, as I was, determined to get some pleasure from the film.) Despite some fine special effects, the first twenty minutes somehow manages to be the most boring. And, some dialogue was laugh-out-loud ridiculous. What kind of lyric is "even though my make-up's flaking..."?I found the "Roxanne" scene the most compelling because it worked narratively, musically and visually.While the film would lose something on a smaller screen, I don't think it's worth the full price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly. I literally had to be dragged into this film kicking and screaming. I knew it had to be the worst movie ever made and I would not in a million years pay to see such tripe. My wife insisted and alas I gave in. Maybe only to keep her quiet.2 Hours 20 minutes Later......Moulin Rouge is an exquisite, tearjerking, mayhem filled Extravaganza. Quite Possibly the best film I have ever seen. I was so glad my wife forced me into that theater, and I pity anyone who doesn't see it in a split minute.Albeit the love story within the love story has been DONE to death but who cares. This is certainly the most original film I have had the pleasure of viewing in a long while. The Performances were top notch besides Nicole Kidman who seemed to be in a daze for most of the film, But Ewan McGregor knocks your socks right off!!! He has a voice that could melt butter and his acting is top notch.I recommend this film to anyone and everyone.Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all else, Love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a big fan of Baz Luhrmann, I was expecting a lot from Moulin Rouge. And it delivered! Everything about it was amazing. A review I read said it takes cliches and pulls real emotion out of them. And I agree. Everything felt new, even though it's been done a million times before. The acting was superb - Ewan Macgregor was so heart-wrenching. My friend and I were falling in love with him as he sang to Kidman's Satine. He was perfect.And Nicole Kidman has the only person who could play this part. Her expressive eyes and perfect turn-of-the-century looks matched the background superbly. She evoked memories of Jean Harlow's silliness, Marilyn Monroe's sexiness, and created in Satine a gloriously contradiction - the naive prostitute. More than a hooker with a heart of gold, Kidman's Satine is childlike, even in her seduction of Christian. Her painful coming of age, brought about by the duke, was wrenching and amazing.Baz's direction and vision are extraordinary. I fell in love with his vision the moment I saw Strictly Ballroom, and Moulin Rouge keeps it going.</fullReview>

I went in with one concept, I didn't know too much about it, and came out with a greater appreciation for the art of the movie musical.My two favorite songs was Madonna's "Like a Virgin", sung by all guys no less, and "Roxanne" sung by the "The Narcoleptic Argentinian" in a great gravel voice. It was an experience that anyone who loves musicals would enjoy and reminiscence about for a long time.All in all, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals.</fullReview>

From the opening Fox studios intro to the gripping climax, the film transports you into to the colourful, exciting and magical world, know as the Moulin Rouge. i just want to go and see this film again and again and again. The use of modern music diced into the late 19th century era is done with sheer perfection and brillance. The mind of Baz Luhrmann is one that must astound anyone who has the pleasure to be associated with him. Ewan and Nicole are perfectly matched. It is certainly Nicole's greatest achievement as an actor. 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is a Diamond among gems. This movie stands out as a brilliant piece of film. It has it all...spectacular imagery, a wonderful story, sensational performances and an amazing musical score. I was extremely impressed by this film, considering I wasn't even going to see it. The movie is beautiful. It has brilliant colour, amazing costumes and is just a wonderful movie to watch. The sets are very well done and I applaud the performances of all involved. John Leguizmo as Talouse Latrec is incredible, taking nothing away from Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor who are magnificent in their roles. I really found the addition of modern music, set in the early 1900's quite an innovation and loved the work that went into these numbers to weave them seamlessly into the film. This film has a vison and it simply fulfills it to a brilliant conclusion. I have not seen a film this good in a long time and whole heartedly recommend it to all. It is also has humour that adds to its charm. I hope to see this film recognized at the next Oscar Ceremonies. It truly is a wonderfully well done piece of movie making and I cannot say enough good things about it! A solid 10 on my list...Moulin Rouge is a must see movie for all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modern Movie Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love movie musicals. The first one I ever saw was "Singing in the Rain" when I was in the first grade. I loved it, and every other musical made during the fifties; the age of movie musicals. Movie Musicals of the fifties took the favorite music of the time, put a cute plot behind it, got some people who could sing and dance, and shot the film. The audiences loved it. Unfortunatly, that genre of movies faded away, and the movie musical died. . . until director Baz Lurhman brought it back. Moulin Rouge, starring Ewan McGregor and Nichole Kidman, is a fantastic movie musical, with all the qualities of one. I feel that many people are looking at it from the wrong angle. It is a great musical, WONDERFUL singing (McGregor and Kidman both have fantastic voices), and the color and costumes are great. Lurhman combined his first two movies (Strictly Ballroom, Romeo + Juliet) and created a fabulous display of color, music, and emotion. Lurhman's sence of color is fantastic, with the two themes of Red and White sprinkled through out the movie. There are lots of little details if one looks close enough. My one complaint is that in the Elephant Love Medley, they really didn't need the "I Will Always Love You" in there. Blech!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was terrible! After reading many comments about how "great" this movie is, I'm wondering, did these people see the same movie I saw? This movie is about a writer who falls for a "courtesan" who just happens to be the leading performer at the Moulin Rouge. Out of all the women that there are in the world, he just happens to fall in love with a prostitute. And, this just happens to be a movie that begins in 1899 and includes musical numbers featuring songs from the 1980s and 1990s. Let me not forget to mention the green fairy that appears to people who drink a drink called abisinthe. Nor should I forget to mention the singing moon in the movie. Yes, that's right folks, A SINGING MOON! It's almost as if this movie was made for little kids. Yet, some people here have gone as far as to call this one of the greatest movies ever made. I'm shocked. I would think that the singing moon was enough to convince people that this is a stupid movie. Do people think that this is a good movie simply because Nicole Kidman is the star of it? I'm starting to think that she's box office poison. Remember "Eyes Wide Shut"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit, I'm a sucker for musicals so my opinion is distinctly biased. If you get p***ed off when characters in a movie break into song, you probably won't like my review.Music: Of course, the music is anachronistic which becomes a bit of an inside joke. Christian (played by Ewan McGregor) is hailed as a brilliant original modern poet while spouting lines from popular music written two generations after 1900. Of course we recognize them as top ten hits. The Bohemians at the end of their summer of love (1899) find them strikingly new and original. Most of the musical production numbers are medleys of songs appropriated from popular culture. Madonna, Cole Porter, The Beatles, Nirvana and Sting get pulled out of context and used in weird ways. This is not new. Bing Crosby and Fred Astare managed to recycle more than 20 Irving Berlin songs in Blue Skies. In most of the cases the songs get put through the wringer and come out as completely new compositions. In some places the two songs are mixed into contrasting harmonies and lyrics that actually work well. In other places you end up with a jumbled mish-mash of songs that don't really fit well together and spoil the effect. In other cases the transformations demonstrate a twisted sense of black humor. (Jim Broadbent's and Gary Oldman's dramatic duet of "Like a Virgin" complete with chorus line is worth about half the price of admission.)Plot: Perhaps I'm a bit spoiled but the plot and the scripting seemed to be one of the weaker parts of this movie. Not only was the music appropriated, but the script in places was appropriated as well. The script alternates between slapstick and tragedy. If you've been raised on too much opera, the movie keeps you guessing, is it heading towards Tosca or La Boheme? The climax comes right out of Charlie Chaplin and then dumps you right into Verdi with a sweet Hallmark tag at the end. I suspect this is a movie that most people either love or hate. I'm a bit in the middle. As a musical, this certainly isn't Sound of Music and it isn't even Evita. The closest musical I can compare it to is Bob Fosse's almost-biography All That Jazz which is another movie that viewers either love or hate. I suspect that All That Jazz would be a good barometer for determining if you want to see Moulin Rouge. If you thought All That Jazz was worth watching, then you would probably appreciate Moulin Rouge. If you find that self-referential and critical musicals are overly self-indulgent, then you probably should skip Moulin Rouge.</fullReview>

Sure, it's pretty to look at sometimes, but please - the script was weak, the songs were lame and corny, and the acting okay. The reason the critics and audiences have "never seen anything like the Moulin Rouge" is because they haven't set foot in a live theatrical venue. This was a poor excuse for a movie. Why not just put it on a REAL stage, and let it flop in a week (because it was so horrible),instead of waiting for a year or two for it to be adapted to the growing theme park we call Broadway? I am so disappointed in this film because I am a huge fan of Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor and Baz Luhrman. Save your money - watch the trailer.

		<fullReview>On the plus side this film is visually very impressive. Colorful, and wonderfully filmed. On the down side they had a lot more film than story, the musical numbers, while charming, are fairly repetetive and, lovely though Nicole Kidman is, there were far too many extreme closeups of her and McGregor. It began to feel like a dermatological exam with shot after shot of Kidman's nostrils or McGregor's pained eyes.Leguizamo puts in the kind of terrific performance we've come to expect from him; in fact, Kidman is the weakest link in the cast and I thought she did fine. You can't fault the performances. Using the modern songs was an interesting touch and part of the fun was figuring out which song they were performing...unfortunately after an hour and a half it was more or less all of the fun.This is not a film you can ignore; bold, loud and musical; it's clear that there was a vision and this is a powerful embodiment of that vision. Unfortunately the vision was a lot shorter than the film. It's a bad sign when you're watching a movie and your mind drifts to another, totally unrelated, movie -- but 100 minutes into Moulin Rouge I found myself admiring a scene from Pearl Harbor which I'd seen the week before.Bravo on the visuals, good performances all around. But not enough story to carry the film and I suspect that most of the audience I saw it with just didn't get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Post Modern Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If someone asked me to sum up the essence of "Moulin Rouge" in one sentence, I would have to say, "an ultimate cliche with extraordinary originality." I realize this is a contradiction, but what wasn't about this film? Outside of "My Fair Lady" I have never been able to stomach a musical, so when I went to see "Moulin Rouge" I was expecting to go to laugh at it. Strangely enough, I consistently found myself laughing with the film rather than at it (as well as crying). Every time a new scene emerged I thought, "here's my chance to scoff," but the film was able to pull me into the other direction EVERY TIME. If anyone wants to know what Post Modern is: this is it. This film took pop culture and made it art...how is that possible? I'm still trying to figure it out.The film, first of all, cannibalizes itself. It's a story about a man writing a play based on the story as it unfolds, and he is writing out the story after the fact. So it's a story within a story within a story. But it is never confusing, surprisingly enough. Secondly, there is a romance. How does one make a movie about a romance of this nature--very cliche--and pull it off? Ask the director and writer of the film and you'll find out. I still can't believe I liked the romantic aspect, but I did. Thirdly, the film is a mixture of genres I haven't seen since "Blade Runner" (although I wouldn't compare the two)--a musical, comedy, tragedy, fairy tale, with some hints of film noir. Fourthly, the film, I don't think, has any original score; rather, it uses a mixture of music from the last thirty years--some so unlikely to be put together that one has to check themselves to make sure they are really hearing the song(s) they are hearing. What I find interesting about the score is that Kidman can sing "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend" while the men below sing "Smells Like Teen Spirit," both in their original tunes, and they work together as if it was all the same song. And fifthly, the movie is obviously a parody of musicals (and parodies are almost impossible to pull of these days without being banal), which is why the mixture of music, the love story, etc. can be well received without indignant guffaws.Well, there were a couple of people who did guffaw and snicker...but they were sixteen year-old teenage girls with their boyfriends who went to go see the movie because of the Madame Marmalade video on MTV--they wouldn't know parody if Christina Aguilara told them personally. And many have been asking if McGregor and Kidman were lip syncing. Actually, no. Everyone in the film sang their own music and did it live (of course, I'm sure there was some "fiddling" around with the sound quality).Anyone with intelligence could see "Moulin Rouge" for what it is: a great film. Over the top? Yes. Silly? Yes. Contradictory? Yes. But strangely enough, it all works because it knows it is all of those things and plays off of them. I walked out of that movie thoroughly surprised at my respect for it. It was worth every dollar I spent and I'll spend it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Moulin Rouge* is unlike any movie you've ever seen, even though it's just like every movie you've ever seen. It is the classic tale of boy loves girl, girl loves boy, one-dimensional villain gets in the way, the lovers spout cliches, and then either they live happily ever after, one of them dies, or they both die. Somehow, though, it transcends all these cliches and becomes something magnificent.A beautiful and often hilarious movie, it will probably be criticized as being "style over substance." Hogwash. *Moulin Rouge* is a ride. Not a Tunnel of Love, but more like a Wind Tunnel of Love. A radio DJ said of the movie, "It's like you stuck No-Doze in every orifice of your body and drank a Mt. Dew." For much of the first half, this is largely true. It almost feels like you're watching a music video, with frenetic action accelerated by dozens of frenzied cuts. Luhrmann recalls the slapstick comedy of yore, complete with exaggerated pratfalls and goofy sound effects. He immerses you in this world. I turned to my friend and said, "This is the craziest ****ing movie I've seen in a long time." The camera...oh, the camera. It zooms in and out, and flies around the elaborate set. The film is a directorial field day for Luhrmann. He creates a fairytale world, complete with a drug-induced Green Fairy voiced by Ozzy Osbourne.Like *A Knight's Tale*, it uses anachronistic music. Although I haven't seen *A Knight's Tale*, I believe it is far more effective here. In the Moulin Rouge, music and songs from the 20th century become integrated into the world of 1900 Paris. The amazing thing is, it fits. The patrons of the cabaret chant, "Here we are now, entertain us, we feel stupid and contagious." Luhrmann uses the music as if it were actually in existence at that time, and by doing so, he shows the universality of it. Music is one of those universal languages, and the most universal form of all is the love song. Whether it is 1900 Paris, 1987 Chicago, or 1473 Spain, love is love. The words Madonna, Sting, Elton John, and countless others used to portray love would have been just as appropriate back then, but they never had a chance to hear them. In one brilliant sequence, Christian (Ewan MacGregor) and Satine (Nicole Kidman) sing a dialogue about love, fluidly jumping from love song to love song, lyric to lyric. They don't sing these songs as songs; they sing them like they *mean* them. It is like a very trippy musical.The fact that Luhrmann pulls together a great deal of love songs is the key to appreciating the movie, because the love between Christian and Satine is idealized. It simply comes into existence and is there in its purest form between them, without logic, without sense. Over and over again, we are reminded that above all, this story is about love. And it really is *about* love. It is love in cinematic form. It is a visual and aural representation of what love is, what it means, and how important it is to human beings.The movie would not be able to get this across if Ewan MacGregor and Nicole Kidman (looking more beautiful than ever) did not give incredible performances. You can see it in their eyes. You feel their pain. You feel their happiness. The supporting cast supports, as well it should. Jim Broadbent (Gilbert in *Topsy Turvy*) plays the owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler. John Leguizamo is real-life midget artist Toulouse-Lautrec, a character I believe is akin to Shakespeare's Fool. And all of the cast can sing unexpectedly well, from a hilariously lyricized can-can to a hilarious "Like a Virgin," from beautiful love songs to a disturbingly appropriate "Roxanne."The music is wonderful, from the orchestral score to the electronica. I advise you to stay and watch the closing credits, not only because you get to hear more music but also because it's not your typical black screen/white letters crawl, and it gives some predictable but appreciated closure at the end.All in all, *Moulin Rouge* grabs you and hits you with the sheer power of itself. When the movie ended, the audience was completely silent. I couldn't really speak. I felt like I felt at the end of *Requiem for a Dream*, except less like I was about to die and more like I had just been handed a transcendent feeling to simply experience, enjoy, and learn from. It is the best new movie I've seen since *Memento*, and as this looks like a slow year for great movies, look for it come Oscar time. Go see it. Now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an ATROCITY!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just because a director does something daring with a movie, it doesn't mean that the movie is worthwhile (or worth its ticket price). That's the case with Baz Luhrmann's highly anticipated (and highly disappointing) "Moulin Rouge". I went to see this movie in the afternoon--I paid five dollars for the ticket, and those are five dollars I wish I would've spent on something else! I don't know anything about Luhrmann or his career as a director. But, if he hasn't been a music video director, then he should be...and that's exactly what this movie should've been--a music video instead of a movie. I mean, modern-day songs mixed into a movie about late-nineteenth century Paris??? The performers in the Moulin Rouge were actually singing "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and "Lady Marmalade". Nicole Kidman was swinging on a trapeze actually singing "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend". And that was just the beginning. Then there's all the love songs sung by Ewan McGregor (he even sings the love song from "An Officer and A Gentleman"). Both he and Kidman can sing well, but c'mon! When I first heard that this movie was being filmed, I thought that it was going to be a remake of the 1952 film of the same name. No way can you compare that drama masterpiece to this musical-gone-mad. This movie is nothing more than a visual showcase...a spectacle. It's pretty to look at. It contains terrific sets, beautiful color schemes, dazzling costumes and hypnotic cinematography. This movie's charm does not go beyond its visuals. I actually walked out of this movie in the middle of it--and I have sat through some really terrible movies before, till the very end. In the case of this movie, after I had to listen to the umpteenth million modern-day song, I couldn't take it anymore. I realized that the best thing for me to do was to just get up and leave...even though I wouldn't be getting back my five dollars. Mind you, I'm only 26 years old and I consider this movie an overdone disaster. The director aimed for too much high energy in this movie. If you want to see a worthwhile musical, rent one (let me suggest "Cabaret").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Impresario extraordinaire! Two thumbs up for Baz Luhrmann for this flamboyant production! An opulent &amp; breathtaking movie with spotlights on the fin-de-siecle pleasures of the era's Parisian cabaret - the exotic rendezvous haunt for dreamers and for those seeking an exuberant and licentious life! Watching this flick is like watching Toulouse-Lautrec's paintings come alive! Whoa, `C'est viva la Montmartre' in operatic sensation! Yep, a series of phenomenally busy-busy scenes with fabulous touches of melodious panache to hold back the audiences' breath! The cooing of great favorites from The Sound of Music to the Beetles! OK, this is a film that defies the era's historical authenticity with close to two and a half hours of these contemporary pops and musicals, yet it incorporates them very nicely to emphasize the scenes and replace the dialogue! Fascinating and truly creative! Overall, everything about this movie fits in like a stunning mosaic piece of art! It carries the spirit of Bernstein's West Side Story, Bonblil's Les Miserables and Chamin's Can-Can... truly a combination of agony and ecstasy! This flick is a non-stop lashing out of everything symbolic of exuberant entertainment! Brilliant, extravagant, and outrageously mesmerizing! Powerfully cinematic with glamour at best! Yet it embraces Montmartre's bohemian life with a bizarre circus quality about it! And within the exotic fantasia lie the telltale of seedy encounters, corruption, prostitution, and the tragedy of a dramatic Romeo-Juliet romance! It's a clandestine love yarn rooted amidst virtue, sins, power, beauty and frantic gaiety! And Satine inflicted with tuberculosis? Not unbelievable! That was the period when tubercle bacillus was identified. Superb cast of talents... they spell out the personalities beautifully! Hey, and it's not fake lip service from McGregor and Kidman... their singing voices are praiseworthy! If there are flaws in this production, I personally care less! The well-choreographed cancan razzmatazz, the music numbers, the colorful costumes and the poignant tragedies actually fired away my complete regard for flaws! Gosh, one fast entertaining scene stomping off from another with such rapid shots. I simply sank into my seat at the end... so fabulously awed and deeply touched by the finale! Just can't wait to see it again! My rating: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say the first time I heard about it was from my sister and she said after five minutes she turned it off because it couldn't hold her interest.However I must admit I sat through the entire thing and this is possibly the best movie I have ever seen. The acting is amazing definitely one of Nicole Kidman's best roles yet.Then of course there is Ewan Mcgregor who not only is a talented actor but one heck of a singer as well. The music itself I found interesting because it was modern day mixed with another era. In the end the music is a big part of the film it shows the passion and the capability of these wonderful actors/actresses. I do hate that Satine dies in the end but I don't believe it would have worked any other way. I would recommend this movie to anyone as long as you have an open mind. It is simply incredible and very easily enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Moulin Rouge!" was an outstandingly wonderful film, just absolutely amazing. One of the best movies i've seen in my entire life time. The music was simply fabulous, how they mixed different songs and made it sound fantastic. Also with an unbelievable story line and a strong cast, this movie was clearly a box office smash hit. I know that many others, myself included, fell in love with this movie the very moment it ended. It's hard not to get lost in the atmosphere this film creates, with all the romance, comedy, and the tragical moments. The casting couldn't have been picked better,They just did such a great job in making this film.Moulin Rouge! is about a song writer named Christian, played by heartthrob Ewan McGregor, who poses as a professional bohemian play writer for the show "Spectacular, Spectacular" which Satine, played by the stunning Nicole Kidman, stars in as the lead Broadway actress. The two develop passionate love for one another but know that their romance is forbidden for Satine is supposed to seduce and be-wed the jealous Duke who will grant her wish to becoming a real actress.I voted this movie 10/10 but honestly my original vote broke the rating scale.</fullReview>

The outrageous characters accompany an equally outrageous set. It seemed like every single song, scene, and sentence conveyed the director's (movie's) message. It truly engaged my mind in seeking an answer to the age old question... what is the meaning of life? Why are we here?... The best part about the movie was when it was over my mind had satisfactory answers. I knew I hadn't really learned anything I didn't know before but the trip was worth taking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange, stylish, comedy-turned-romantic-tragedy. It's hard to put it into one genre, but as funny as it is sad, it's simply a must see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first started Moulin Rouge! I felt like I was on a trip, in fact, I found it so incredibly off I didn't watch it. I couldn't watch it. Too strange. But then a friend of mine convinced me to give it another try, which I did, and I don't regret it. Moulin Rouge! is a hard movie to place, it's hysterically off kilter, it's depressingly sad and emotional, it's musically sensational, and it's definitely different. It tells the story of Christian (Ewan McGregor) a young poet and writer who has come to Paris in search of a job, against his fathers wishes, who warns him that he'll end up wasting his time with a Cancan dancer at the Moulin Rouge, and that there is no such thing as 'freedom, beauty, truth, and above all things, Love.' Which is something that Christian believes in more than anything else. So then,an unconscious Argentinian falls through his roof, along with an artist named Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo) (A real person, so I've heard) and herd of other rather eccentric people, trying to find a good song for their next production (Christian comes up with 'The Hills are Alive') and is then whisked away to the Moulin Rouge, an enormous night club owned by eccentric Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent), the main attraction being his 'Diamond Dogs'. One of his star women, Satine(Nicole Kidman), wows the stage, and is to have a private meeting with a Duke shortly after her act. Well, Christian and Toulouse have already ran into the Duke, and when Zidler points out the duke to Satine, she does not see the Duke, but rather Christian, who instead shows up at the private meeting. Sound weird enough to you? It's even weirder to see. All the music in the movie is great, but if it seems familiar, that's because all but one song (The gorgeous 'Come What May')are remixes of classic rock and stage play songs. It still sounds unique and it all matches the on screen looniness. All though it's established that Moulin Rouge! is a weird movie, it's also a very sad movie. Each character has their own unique charm, and the silliness doesn't totally leave the movie, it stays consistent, but it of course, had to be toned down to make way for the more emotional, and serious main act, which will leave you in tears. I admit, the scenes leading up to the saddest part of the movie do seem unfitting as the end is a hard blow out of a rather exciting scene, but it's clear that the comedic part has made it's end, and it's time for the main act to deal out it's sad story. The movie does what a lot can't: It provides two different stories, that remain consistent with one another. The comedy act almost always hits, with you snickering or even laughing out loud at the overall craziness of the characters, but then the romance act sneaks in, and it's genuine and true, and in some points, even does a collaborative dance with the comedy act, but the romance ends in Tragedy, which severs it's ties with the comedy, though it never loses step. It's a wonderful movie, it's funny, it's sad, it's weird, and I would recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overview - Dumas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is excellent. I first watched it at my girlfriend's house, and liked it very much. However, one thing became very clear to me. This story is based either on Alexandre Dumas's play "La dame aux camelias" or the subsequent Verdi opera "La traviata". Despite the apparent thoroughness of the story, it is a wonderful representation of the play, I found no mention of the inspiration therein, or even its author, in the credits. Perhaps someone can clue me in. Am I missing something, or did the producers here fail to recognize that Dumas deserves credit? If anyone is wondering how I know this, it is through extensive study of the afore-mentioned Verdi opera, La traviata. In Moulin Rouge, I have even found similarities between the lines in the screenplay and Francesco Maria Piave's libretto written for Verdi's opera. Intrigued, I purchased a copy of La dame aux camelias and read through the text, and watched Moulin Rouge. There were so many similarities there that it was astounding! Seeing as the producers of this film (to whom I am eternally indebted for a wonderful movie and even more wonderful memories) failed to give credit to Dumas, Piave, Verdi, or even the character about which Dumas wrote his play (based on real life!) Alphonsine Plessis, or Marie DuPlessis, it should most definitely be noted that as wonderful as the movie is, it is something of a fraud. Well, perhaps that's a bit severe, but at the very least, I think they should submit something, somewhere, saying that they had neglected to give credit to Piave or Dumas, seeing as they took lines from both of them! Just a thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw Moulin Rouge was in that week of collective numbness following 9/11. We had made our way first to the Grosvenor Square US embassy to make a gesture of solidarity and its impromptu garden or remembrance and from thence to Odeon marble arch. The film itself astonished us - from its manic opening 10 minutes when we seemed witness to a star-studded, epic and monumental folly of film-making, to being, like Satine, swept from our firmly-planted critical feet and propelled along by its spectacular (spectacular) visual and intellectual ravishments. At that moment, leaving the theatre it seemed a joyous manifesto of what, decadent, dissolute, secular and unrooted as we are, we stand for in this world, which has true value, and what stands against us - cold, unforgiving and immune to the ideals of the 'Bohemian Revolution'. I have watched it many times since, its fascination unfading like that of the Wizard of Oz, as it is almost a version of that film for adults, but instead of a monochrome ending we are plunged into the deepest black - which in all truth we know awaits us all in any case. Wizard of Oz is equally applicable to its director, as it is a directorial feat that transforms it, alchemically, from lead to gold. Without the boldest and most extreme editing, and a tongue continually planted in its cheek most of the dialogue sections between the setpieces would have ruined the film, even accounting for some stellar performances from the principles. Instead they are played melodramatically yet sincerely, and it works, allowing the story to flow between the sensual, comedic and tragic delights expressed for the most part in song and dance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aesthetics and emotion fused into one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit, it's hard for me to be objective about "Moulin Rouge." I've loved it since I saw it in the cinema, it was the first DVD I owned, and I still return to it. Every time, Baz Luhrmann's colorful, heartfelt, and sometimes overpowering film-making draws me into the movie's world of beautiful design and high emotion.Yes, the plot is a total cliché--a love triangle between penniless poet Christian, doomed courtesan Satine, and a sneeringly villainous Duke. "Moulin Rouge" is intelligent enough to winkingly acknowledge the melodrama at times (it also winks at some iconic bits of pop culture), but irony is not the film's prevailing mood. The actors play many scenes completely straight, speaking the sometimes-trite dialogue so earnestly that you come to believe it after all.And what marvelous performances! It's rare to find a male actor giving a performance as open and pure and vulnerable (and handsomely sung) as Ewan MacGregor's. Nicole Kidman gamely, and skillfully, does everything from low comedy to high tragedy to old-fashioned movie-star glamour. Jim Broadbent, playing the Moulin Rouge's owner Harold Zidler, finds unexpected depth and tenderness in his vulgar and blustering character.In many musicals, the songs are moments of heightened emotion, but are also designed to show off the actors' singing and dancing talent. "Moulin Rouge," on the other hand, emphasizes emotion above all else. Yes, the corps of can-can dancers is excellent, and McGregor and Kidman sing very nicely, but the film-making, and the mood it evokes, is the true star. My favorite sequence, the "Roxanne" tango, encapsulates Luhrmann's technique. It's a wickedly clever use of a familiar song, turning it from a catchy, groovy little tune into something boiling over with tension and danger. The film rapidly cuts between the passionate tango dancers, Christian's heartfelt counter-melody, and a fight between Satine and the Duke in the tower, building to a climax where image, sound, and emotion fuse into one.The credo of the Bohemian characters, and of "Moulin Rouge"'s creators, is "Truth, beauty, freedom, and love." I would argue that a fifth item should be added to that list: Art. The whole movie is about how life imitates art and art imitates life; how art can redeem and resurrect us; and most importantly, how art is central to the Bohemian credo. Art is "fake," but it conveys a higher truth; art highlights life's beauty; artistic expression is a kind of freedom; art inspires love."Moulin Rouge," a piece of film-as-art, does all those things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come what may, I'll love this movie until my dying day!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a world of complicated concepts and unfamiliar ways of life one familiar concept is handed to us on a silver platter. Love. To the English writer called Christian love is like oxygen. Love is a many splendered thing. Love lifts us up where we belong. All you need is love! One problem. He's never been in love. And so the journey at the Moulin Rouge begins. And in a wave of familiar lyrical songs and laugh-out-loud jokes, you watch as a young, sensitive, handsome, penniless writer falls for a clever, sexy, Cortesan called Satine. It seems as though the only thing the two have in common is there singing talents and there desire for something greater. But things start to get a little more complicated than Christian thought when Satine is sold to the Duke in exchange for investments on their new play, and when Satine becomes deathly ill. What was a sweet and lighthearted romance turns into a desperate race for Satine's love, and overwhelming jealousy and a sense of ownership create a power on screen that becomes heart wrenching. Baz delivers a few powerful renditions of modern songs and delivered lines that make the audience gasp. Such as the scene where the Duke asks why the Cortesan shouldn't fall in love with the Maharajah. In an angry and frustrated rage Christian screams out "BECAUSE SHE DOESN"T LOVE YOU!" Sending further suspicion that Christian and Satine are in love. The daring casting of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman give it an extra leap of faith that proves to be "Spectacular!" And the unexpected romantic aspects have ever female viewer in tears. But an extreme in opinion shows a serious viewing issue. Many who are spontaneous, passionate, and artistic will love this. The combination of the passionate love story, the wonderful music and art direction and the character's want of something greater is gripping. But the viewer has to be very opened minded. This film is a breakthrough in musicals. But is slightly odd. The plot has the kind of feel of Pretty Woman, but much more artistic. All in all, this is a great romantic passionate, art driven movie. Baz made moves in this film that no one has ever seen done. Yet it's captivating and emotionally driven and sends you to a place you can only go to in the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is the most visually unique thing I've seen since I don't know when. I watch an awful lot of movies, and I pay attention to things like color and camera work. A lot of people don't. In Moulin Rouge, you can't help it. These aspects grab you by the collar and shake you around for 2 hours. From the bright, vibrant, almost neon nighttime colors when the Bohemian ideals (love, truth, beauty) of Montmarte are celebrated, to the brownish, daytime hues when harsher realities set in, this movie sustains our attention. The images run the range from beautiful (Satine, bathed in blue light) to garish (the owner's appearance, and his tendency to shout loudly and closely in people's faces) to bleak (the entire setting when the plot grows more grim).I am not even a fan of musicals per se. There have been occasional musicals that I have enjoyed, but I am not one to sit down and relish the choreographed movements of the Sharks and Jets. Yet if any non-musical lover has a chance of crossing over, this is it. Moulin Rouge is a musical on speed, a post-modern musical for the new millennium. If anyone can remain unaffected by the Roxanne "number" near the end, I would confess astonishment. Its sheer power and fast-paced rhythm carries us along. It's one of the most incredible examples of virtuoso editing I can think of.The movie is thoroughly saturated with song. When no music is being sung, it becomes part of the dialog. Someone should count how many different songs are sung or partially quoted. From Elton John to Rogers and Hammerstein, the movie is a like a collage of music.It ends as quietly as its middle was loud. When the credits began to roll, the movie theater was silent. No one talked or made much noise; it was a response approaching reverence or at least respect.Perhaps Kenneth Turan of the L.A. Times said it best. His comment takes into account that Moulin Rouge may have its detractors. But it underscores the film's uniqueness, its coherence as something entirely different: "You can go with it or resist it, be exhilarated or worn out. But forgetting the experience is not one of your options."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On my top 10 list</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched Moulin Rouge because it was a musical, but it turns out it's not just any ordinary musical- it's a story that's heartbreaking and realistic.Set in 1899, in Paris, France, it's a vivid love story. Christian, a handsome young writer, comes to Paris from London to write about truth, beauty, freedom, and love, the ideals of the Bohemian Revolution, despite his father's scorn of the whole idea. There was only one problem with this- he'd never been in love before.As he is puzzling about how to write about something he'd never experienced, a Narcoleptic Argentinean falls through his ceiling from the flat above his own, and a carefree, laughing dwarf comes in to rescue the Argentinean. The dwarf, the Argentinean, and three other men who are peering down through the hole in Christian's ceiling are working on a play called Spectacular Spectacular, which they are to present to Harold Zidler the next day. Christian comes up to substitute for the Argentinean, who is still unconscious, and an argument ensues among the other men on what the words and tune to a song in the play should be. When Christian comes up with the perfect match, it is voted that he write the play.Zidler is the owner of the Moulin Rouge, a nightclub where "the rich and powerful come to play with the young and beautiful creatures of the underworld". Toulouse, the dwarf, passes Christian off as a famous English writer, and arranges for him to meet with Satine, the most beautiful of all the Moulin Rouge dancers, who will, in turn, convince Zidler to have Christian write the play.Zidler had arranged, however, for Satine to meet a duke that evening, which is who Satine mistakes Christian for, and soon Satine has to choose between the two men. The duke falls in love with Satine and shows her all the wonderful things he can give her, but Christian shows Satine all the things that true love can be. As it becomes harder to hide their love, Satine has another problem that is becoming harder to avoid- a more personal one that leads to a tragic climax.This is a beautiful story that definitely makes my top 10 list of movies- I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favourite film by far and I think it is amazing! I think it is very clever how the writers have adapted contemporary songs and incorporated them into the script. I also love the variety of styles such as comedy, romance and tragedy. My favourite part is the 'Like a virgin' sequence, which is hilarious! But you'll have to watch the film to see it! All the actors and actresses in the film are very talented and mostly sing the songs themselves, which I think is fantastic and makes the film even better, if that is possible! I think this film could be enjoyed by most people, although there is a lot of singing and music, so if you don't like that kind of thing it may not be the film for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought I'd seen it all, but that was before Moulin Rouge. Normally I'm not a real musical lover, although I loved Jesus Christ Superstar, Hair, Tommy and a few others, but like JCS, which was a weird musical too, this one also rocked my world. Songs from Madonna to Marilyn Monroe and everything in between, the good actors (I didn't know Nicole Kidman could also sing, is there anything she can't do? and of cause nobody could top Ewan), the beautiful clothes, jewelery, dancing, great songs, all beautiful made by Baz, who I thought already was a genius after Romeo and Juliet, but now, how does he plan to top this one. The only weird thing was that a musical like Chigaco, that was really bad if you don't count Richard Gere (he looks good in every movie), won all kinds of Oscars, but not Moulin Rouge???? Shame on the people at the academy. They give Nicole enough credit, but always for the wrong movies. I don't like the Botox-Kidman, but I love her in almost every movie, especially this one. A big TEN!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this the first time, I was with some friends on New Years. We ended up watching it 2 times and that started an obsession of Moulin Rouge and especially Ewan McGregor. The movie is excellent. It is a mixture of comedy and drama. And I did put the warning about a spoiler on there, so I can go and spoil it now. Yes, Satine dies in the end (of course it tells you that info in the beginning, and I personally think that they shouldn't have given that out). And the Duke gets shut down and punched in the face by wonderful Harold Zidler (Good for him!). My favorite part is, of course, the beginning with its invigorating fast pace and funny lines and general... funniness! It is hilarious when Christian (a.k.a. Ewan) is trying to make up a production storyline on the spot, and I love the Duke's expressions to the different ideas! Of course, the highlight of the whole movie was the beautiful singing that came out of lovely Christian's beautiful mouth (lol). Especially their secret song (Come What May). I congratulate the composer or arranger of these songs in the movie, because they are gorgeous, and it sounds amazing! Well, I had better stop myself, though I could go on about this movie FOREVER! If you haven't seen it, do so very very quickly- you will most DEFINITELY not regret it. Unless you're not into musicals so much. But other than that it is fantastic and it is highly, highly commended! I LOVE YOU, EWAN!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this beautiful movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is an incredible movie, truly "Spectacular, Spectacular"! The scenery, lighting and costumes are unbelievably beautiful. Then there's the music.......amazing use of contemporary music in 1900 Paris! Nicole &amp; Ewan's voices are wonnnnderful together. Did not know either of them could sing, but both of them have great voices and together they ARE breath-taking. The dance number is haunting - after watching the movie, I find myself singing "why does my heart cry...." for days! Also, "Come What May" runs through my mind often, too.Nicole is "drop-dead" beautiful as Satine. I have always admired her acting. I do believe she is one of the finest actresses there is - she IS "Sarah Bernhart" and then some. Not hard to imagine that Christian, the Duke and every other man for miles around would fall in love with her. I enjoyed her (their) humorous touches, too! Ewan, on the other hand, I hadn't much noticed before (I DO now!) He was lovable and adorable as Christian. Many of his facial expressions warmed my heart and/or broke it. He is a marvelous actor as well. He and Nicole are fantastic together - the perfect couple! In view of the "Spectacular, Spectacular" production, direction, acting, and music; I am puzzled that the movie was not even more successful in the USA. We are a real "bohemian" society and Love is a prevalent, dominant theme in movies, advertising, etc. I guess, in general, we have no taste for the finer things.... Suffice it to say, I absolutely loved it and will continue to watch it over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a movie!! I have to say i've never liked musicals, but the day i saw this movie it kept me thrilled during the 2 hours it lasts. I thought that it was impossible first to make love songs in the ambient of the Moulin Rouge for the fact that it is a cabaret and "courtesans" can't fall in love, but Bazz Luhrman did a great Job directing the movie and placing the songs in the right time to elevate this movie to a DELIGHTFUL EXPERIENCE.Won't say anything about the plot, because there are others who have already done that, and very well, but i have to talk about the songs, it is a subject apart, it begins with a song of David Bowie performed by John Leguizamo and it gives you the clue it is a romantic movie with a sad ending, and that song is the one that establishes the climate you'll feel later in the movie. Then we have Lady Marmalade performed by.......well we all know who perform that song. the next great moment of songs is when Zidler appears and the whole Moulin Rouge sings and dances by the rhythm of "the can can", a really aggressive song with a really modern sound. Then we have the introduction of "Satine" (Nicole Kidman) singing "Sparkling diamonds" and it shows us a Character that only loves material stuff, she doesn't care about love, thing is going to change when she meets Christian (Ewan McGregor) and he teaches her the meaning and importance of love. Then we begin with the great love songs of this superb movie "Your song" , "One day i'll fly away" "The elephant love medley" and "Come what may", what can i say about these songs, they are just too great to say something about them and those songs make you wanna see this movie again and again and again.If we should analyze the outfits and ambient of the movie, it couldn't be better, it is all colorful and filled with energy everywhere (you really see this is Bazz creation). It is everything red and there's a lot of fireworks everywhere, like celebrating love and life.Resuming, this a an experience that no one should miss, though not everybody shares my optimism, i guess they just can't understand it well, because this movie is really a MASTERPIECE, no doubt of that......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie over a year ago, and this is one of the best films I have ever seen! If you haven't seen it, I certainly suggest going out to your nearest store and purchasing it!!! Baz Luhrmann's masterpiece, featuring the lovely Nicole Kidman as a nightclub diva and Ewan McGregor as a penniless writer is one of the greatest love stories of the 20th century.The dancing, the singing... Nicole did an excellent job, and Ewan's voice just blew me away!!! I still sing the songs and listen to the soundtracks I have, and it is just something you either love and or hate. I have never seen such a wonderful picture, what else could I say? Even though some of it may not seem unrealistic (at times), who doesn't want a man singing to them like how Ewan does to Nicole? Besides that, they were in love, and who doesn't love a love story? I think Baz Luhrmann is an absolete genius and he is considered God in my eyes. He took the dive, along with everyone else involved in this project, and it was certainly worth the plunge.I am always using the famous quotes from the film, but mostly just this one... "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love... and be loved in return."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pop Opera Musical Of The Highest Calibre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Baz Luhrman completes his Red Curtain Trilogy (Strictly Ballroom, Romeo and Juliet) with Moulin Rouge, released in 2001. It is an combination of theatrical and musical forms coming together in harmony to produce a moving romantic tragedy. It's also an attempt to bring back the musical film genre, which has been lost since the days of "My Fair Lady" "The Sound of Music", "Camelot" and "Oliver," all of which were made into musicals in the 60's. True, many people object to musicals on screen. They seem to want it to remain strictly on stage. As of late, Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom Of the Opera was released in theaters starring Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum in a Joel Schumacher film. Chicago won Best Picture in 2003. It's hard to say what it is Hollywood wants, really. Musicals on film are just as dramatic and powerful as any straightforward drama. While Moulin Roug does go over-the-top at times and the performances are throwbacks to operatic convention -boy meets girl, they fall in love, villain wants the girl for himself, girl dies, this can still work if the movie has a certain magic touch and Moulin Rouge has this. It's a great film with easy accessibility by a young MTV-fed audience. The songs featured within the plot are Elton John's "Your Song", Whitney Houston's "I will Always Love You" "Love Lifts Us Up Where We Belong" "Silly Love Songs" and seemingly all the most memorable love songs of the 20th century. In addition, pop numbers by Madonna "Like A Virgin" and the new version of Patti Labelle's "Lady Marmalade" sung by Missy Elliot, Christina Aguilera and Lil' Kim. The dance sequences during the "Sultan and Courtesan" opera which mirror the plight of Satine and Christian, was modeled after choreographed Baliwood musical dances. It is quite desperate in its attempt to kick in the new 21st century musical but it works, mainly because of the strong leads. Nicole Kidman as the tragic, La Traviata type heroine Satine, a courtesan for the eponymous nightclub, is doing a terrific performance. Furthermore, it's quite different from her normally serious work as an actress. She's really having fun with this character, especially in the "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend" number. She sang using her own voice, too. Ewan Mcgreggor plays her true love, the poet Christian. He is sensitive, warm and artsy in the role, and again, he is using his own voice. Baz Luhrman may have already conceived the idea for staging "La Boheme" which hit theaters only about a year later. The scenery and art direction was modeled after the Montmartre that is used in Moulin Rouge. The voice of tenor Placido Domingo was used as the Man In The Moon, a little bit of trivia for you opera fans.</fullReview>

The cast is also excellent, with Nicole kidman and Ewan McGregor you can count on this movies like one of your classic favorites. The appearance of David Wenham is also interesting, and it proves the abilities this great actor has. So don't forget to watch this film you will be so spectacular spectacularly amused!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely the one of the best romance films of the century. The movie was done so well that it gives off something for teens to realize. Don't let your romance fall flat on it's feet. This movie almost is a guide into your romance. Don't let anyone push you away, and certainly don't let anyone tell you can't have what you want. The movie itself is fantastic. The actors were amazing. Nicole Kidman plays a can-can dancer named Satine and brought up to believe she was only worth what someone would pay for her. So you can understand her line of business.Ewan Mcgregor plays a sad romantic who has never been in love and actually realizes this when he's typing it on his keyboard. So then his friends, well, i'm not sure friends is what he thinks of them, but then pass him off as an English writer and they all went to the Moulin Rouge. Funny enough, Satine mistakes McGreoger for the Duke who is a powerful man who was willing to invest in the Moulin Rouge if he has Satine. Then the movie plays out into where the Duke invests in the show they tried to cover up when he accused Christian of foul play, and turns the Moulin Rouge into a theater. The movie shows fantastic work by Baz Thuriman and Nicole Kidman sparkles. Moulin Rouge shows us everything truth, beauty, freedom, betrayal, suspicion, jealously, and outstanding love. Moulin Rouge is a breathtaking experience and will leave your heart pounding. I highly recommend this to all, especially hopeless romantics. A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first picked up this DVD, I was skeptical about watching a musical movie. I thought I will fall asleep but I was wrong.Moulin Rouge! is a very colourful movie with beautiful costumes and great songs. The only original song was "Come What May", which was originally composed for Romeo + Juilet. Ewan McGregor sang very well in "Your Song". I have to say I like his style better than Elton John's original version.I read some of the comments in IMDb and there are extremely negative as well as extremely positive comments. You guys have to understand that Baz Luhrmann and Quentin Tarantino belong to the same league. They produce unique movies that are different from the rest. You either hate it or love it. I personally love Kill Bil Volume 1 but not Volume 2.Mao points: 10/10</fullReview>

Christian visits the Moulin rouge where he falls in love with the star, Satine. Satine mistakes Christian for the duke and falls in love with him. As the film goes on, they face many challenges to keep their love a secret and the duke interested. At the end Satine realises that Christian is in great danger. She makes him believe she doesn't love him and sends him away. But Christian comes back. When the show is over, the duke is out of the way and Setain and Christian are no longer needing to hide their love, everything looks great. Until the tragedy of Satine dying comes along. This film is the best musical i have ever watched. The songs get stuck in my mind. Better actors could not have been chosen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the dubious joy of watching Moulin Rouge last night on the TV and not having seen it before had a reasonably open mind about it - all I knew was that it was a love story between Nicole Kidman &amp; Ewan McGregor set in late 19th century Paris and that the film had won all sorts of rave reviews.I stuck with the film all of the way through but thought that it resembled a poorly directed music video rather than a film with most shots lasting no more than about 2 seconds. Indeed I'm sure that this film would not be suitable for photo-sensitive people.I found the plot hard to follow at the best of times and then realized that the "plot" was more detailed in the TV guide synopsis than in the film itself. In all honesty the film seemed to be a showcase for Luhrman's so-called cinematography which to me as an avid movie-goer was nothing more than one big visual insult.As others have said this is film that is loved or hated - I for one won't be watching it again as I thought that it was one of the most hyped films of recent time.2/10 - Jim Broadbent features in this</fullReview>

Ewan McGregor is a dream boat and boy can he sing. I voice from heaven and a body made by the devil. (ha, ha) The choreography was spectacularly done. I loved how they used songs from the past, it was creative. The director, producer, and writer Baz Luhrmann is a movie genius. The way he setup movie and with the camera angles, shows this imaginary world where all thing do happen. Where the nightly pleasures and undying love meet you find meaning hidden. I really loved the bright colors used on the set and with the costumes. It made the movie's beat so vibrant and wild with energy.When I first saw the movie I was bewildered and a little insulted but I out grew it. The movie is a little odd but it is also magical. It's the filthy day dreams we secretly have. Except in our day dreams we don't burst out into song. Although that would be cool. Moulin Rouge was just a WOW, WONDERFUL, FUN, EXCITING, GREAT MOVIE.

		<fullReview>(possible Spoilers included)This is a degenerate film. Out of disrespect for the film the review really ought to end there, but i'll elaborate. The trip, because that's all it amounts to, starts when Ewan McGregor takes his hit of drugs and decides to go clubbing. At the club me meets a stripper who he develops an infantile sexual infatuation with. The stripper is sleeping with the boss to keep her job. They have an affair, which for him is actually *literally* delusional fantasy. Various sorry sex-obsessed infantilisms drag the film along until finally she cynically ditches him to keep her job as star stripper, then "symbolically" dies. He ends up as a ruined wreck. That amounts to the story; totally wacked out insanity followed by an existentialist ending, communicated via soft-core porno, awful music, and cheap smut humor populated by an assortment of psychologically deranged comic book characterizations. I have not seen such a sick, ugly and revolting film for quite a while.If you are an existentialist sex-obsessed, drug taking, dance-club-cult follower, then this is the film to deaden your mind further with. If, however, you retain some vestige of humanity, don't bother subjecting yourself to more calculated ugliness than is necessary.</fullReview>

I don't know about the rest of you, but I hope with all of my heart that Baz Luhrmann keeps making films and beautiful (to put it mildly) music. I also hope with all of my heart that someone out there keeps Ewan MacGregor singing. Why did it take so long to get that gorgeous voice and man out there in this kind of role?!?!

I am amazed because this movie is quite extreme, in that the actors are actually singing, and the most weird things keep happening, but still it is a well told story. You can see that this movie doesn't take itself too seriously, but other moments are very real and serious, and I think they work extra well because of this contrast.

Seeing Ewan spout out U2's Pride "In the name of love..." to Nicole Kidman was sickening. Obviously many people disagree with me, which is fine. But for my tastes, this film was vulgar filth.

		<shortDescription>Hard to fault ... but not to everyone's tastes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is the 3rd of Baz Luhrmann's Red Curtain trilogy and arguably, the installment that takes the Red Curtain concept the furthest. As such, it is not a film that will appeal to everyone either in concept, story, style or execution. I, however, find it a film that it is difficult to fault but can understand the criticism of others. As for the plot, it is loosely based on the Opheian myth (Orpheus and the Underworld) and is a love story which uses very similar story telling devices to Romeo and Juliet and is based around Montmatre and Moulin Rouge in turn of the century (1899) France. The key device that this film will be remembered for is its use of modern songs in a period setting (not an original concept but taken further than previous films have dared). The acting and musicianship of the headlining actors is excellent and each brings something to the film as a whole. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is an idealistic, naive writer and McGregor brings a degree of honesty and vulnerability to the role, particularly in his early scenes with Nicole Kidman. Kidman herself plays Satine, the courtisan in chief of the Moulin Rouge and completely owns this role. It is impossible to imagine anybody else playing the part as well as Kidman and her musicianship, particularly in "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend) is also top-notch. Jim Broadbent plays Harold Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge and mostly is there to provide comedy. However, he performs well and creates real shades of light and dark. Finally, Richard Roxburgh as the Duke, is a good comedic villain, who also managed good variation between light and dark. In fact, the only characters I did not care for were the other Bohos such as Toulouse (played by John Leguizamo - a Luhrmann favourite). They suffer from being the story devices to get Christian to the Moulin Rouge and as such, they feel shoehorned in to scenes taking place after the Elephant scene.The direction is typical Luhrmann - brash, colourful, quick and stylish. Admittedly, the first 20-30 minutes of the film are not easy viewing as they invoke the style of old WB cartoons and there is also a lot of jump cutting. This is, I believe, the main thing which puts certain audiences off. However, if you can get past this, the direction settles down post "Spectacular Spectacular" number. It's hard not to like this - it has charm, wit, drama and romance and for the most part, is an original concept. The set and costume design also show an amazing attention to detail. The dancing exudes energy especially the Can Can in the Moulin Rouge. But I think the Tango scene is where it is used to best effect. However, if you do know someone who hates musicals, this is not the film to try and convert them.In my opinion, an original, modern classic and the sort of film-making that should only be encouraged. Superb 10/10 (Plus, if you liked this, try Singing In The Rain if you haven't already seen it.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bravo Baz!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who loves artistic, emotional and different films has to see this masterpiece by Baz Luhrman. As the third installment of the red curtain trilogy by Luhrman it clearly indicates how the director has developed as an artist.To begin with it has to be said: Moulin Rouge is not for everyone. Due to the fact that it has a unique and at times absurd take on the musical genre. However, I think its pure genius. The way in which cliché after cliché is uttered by the protagonists and modern songs are given a new treatment to suit the orphean myth in this musical, which set during the belle epoque, is just awe inspiring.This movie touched me on so many emotional levels due to the clever usage of known songs and overly romantic dialogue.The fact that Moulin Rouge can make an audience laugh and cry, and all the while be utterly entertained is very extraordinary in a time when Hollywood produces so many movies that you feel like you've already seen ten times before and that make you wonder why on earth you even bothered to pay for the ticket.The casting is superb.I wasn't a big fan of Nicole Kidman before this movie but this movie truly proves she has star power and great screen presence. Ewan Macgregor is equally astonishing in his role.The chemistry between the two is sparkling and its amazing how they can make their love for each other so believable in such an unbelievable story.The art direction deservedly won an oscar, creating a suiting atmosphere for the movie: heightened reality at its best.This movie is an art piece. It made me feel and experience something truly unique and memorable. The music, art, casting, directing, photography, editing and mood, make Moulin rouge a roller- coaster ride of emotions you do not want to miss!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I put off watching any musical made after WestSide Story so I did not see Moulin Rouge until this week. I am so sorry I missed it on a big-screen. I was awe-struck. The music, the dancing, the singing..everything. It was so exciting. I loved everything about it. What wonderful direction. I can even pick out which actor was the best...they were ALL perfect. Why cant more movies be made of this quality?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a movie only a narcissist could love. You can have it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My God, there are a lot of comments about this movie. And though I felt like there was no reason to post anything about it because of the high number and the fact that no one would likely read it, I realized that if I took that attitude, George Bush would get re-elected easily. So, with that in mind, I absolutely hated this movie. It's like a movie made for people with short attention spans. It's for people who just want everything to be FABULOUS. They can't stomach anything related to character development or any meaning. They just want to be "dazzled". This movie is NOT dazzling. The director, Baz whatever...seems to not trust a shot that lasts longer that 10 seconds. He's so busy moving his camera around and shoving "shots" in our faces that he gives the viewer no time to take anything in. The shame is that there are some images that I would have liked him to dwell on longer. It's a movie that MIGHT have worked for me if I was high on something but as it is, it made me feel depressed because of it's shallowness and my knowledge that a LOT of people were going to make a more out of this than it deserved. People see movies like this and are so taken with "The Look" that they immediately think "well, it's so great looking and moves so fast that no slob could've made it". Well, it's the old adage that junk can be made to look like art. I actually feel sorry for people who love this kind of movie. They're probably as shallow as the movie. It's a movie only a narcissist could love. You can have it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first and only movie up to now that i fell hopelessly and forever in love with just from its very beginning! all my friends (except one, who actually told me to see this film because it's already a classic) thought it was too melodramatic and maudlin, too sugary and mawkish, but for me it is more than a masterpiece. i was totally enthralled with it as early as the scene in which satine was hiding christian from the duke which is one of the funniest things i've ever seen in cinema (excluding a lot of memorable moments from "dumb&amp;dumber" but this movie falls into a completely different category). i also adored the blazing style of all the dance scenes, all the colours and vibrance in them, the ingenuity of the adaptations of contemporary songs (which in other context, in other movie i would have thought inappropriate in the least) - my favourite is the tango of the argentinian. another of my favourite scenes is the one in which the duke is singing this elton john song - and he sings so heartbreakingly badly and makes such a face that somehow you start pitying him and, of course, you can never think of him as the bad guy in the way you think about bad guys in action movies for example.</fullReview>

Then there is also music which has a great part in this movie since it is a musical. The music that were chossen matched perfectly with the movie. The lights and special effects were great too and even the course of the story, from youth to adulthood. It was nice. It makes you want to watch over and over again. Then the actors were great.

		<fullReview>*spoiler within*A perfect example of the decline of artistry in popular culture, not only in itself but in the insidious popularity it gained. Moulin Rouge was repeatedly lauded for being "artistic" by its fans. No description could be less apt. The dizzying camera effects, the lavish sets and sequinned costumes, and the purchased rights to sample just about every pop song from the last thirty years: these are not the visions of an artist; they are the machinations of an egomaniac with a morbidly obese budget.All chance of subtlety destroyed in the first few minutes, Moulin Rouge goes on to state its three virtues: "truth, beauty, and most of all love," which it will repeat the names of ad nauseum. Let's look at those one by one. Truth is utterly lacking in this film. Set in a turn-of-the-century whorehouse, the production is glitzier than Broadway's "42nd Street." Neither this nor the utterly generic plot lends any bit of credence to its claims of truth. Beauty is not to be found either, as the film is so gaudy that even Nicole Kidman can not stand out. Her quiet, nymph-like beauty does not go well at all with her surroundings, and she appears pale and sickly (only foreshadowing the end by sheer dumb luck). That brings me to love, which is the the most sorely lacking part of the movie. At what point do the main characters fall in love? Never. Their relationship consists of idiotic musical numbers and the word "love" bounced back and forth faster than a ping pong ball carrying the plague. Anyone duped by the embarrassing sincerity of Kidman and Ewan McGregor, both good enough actors to force out their hokey lines, clearly does not know what love is. And "Sparkling diamond?" Are you kidding me?I try to watch this movie every time it's on cable. I *try* to watch it, but I've never forced myself to sit through five minutes of it since I saw it in the theater. The musical numbers are too embarrassing (with the exception of the cover of The Police's "Roxanne"), the acting too earnest (with the exception of Jim Broadbent, who is always cool no matter what), and the dialogue too ridiculous (with no exception- none at all).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really, truly loved this movie when I originally saw it. I saw it twice in the theaters, and both times it was a really unforgettable cinematic experience. However, upon seeing this movie again, it is just, in my opinion, a little overdone. Personally, I think it would have been much more tolerable if it had been cut a considerable amount of time, but the love story gets very ...meh...to me. Although many wont agree, Nicole Kidman is, at best, and overrated actress. Ewan is a little better, but I don't see the "wow" factor everyone else sees. His voice is certainly better than Nicole's. I think the cinematography and direction is really good, but I just think this movie doesn't have quite the power to make me want to watch it multiple times. There can be too much of a good thing. I'm giving it a 2, to even out the 10 I gave it before I discovered it, well, annoyed me. What bothers me most is when people assume it started a musical revival that paved the way for Chicago. Not true. It isn't as if Chicago wasn't going to be made before Moulin Rouge came out. It was like 20 years in the making. Chicago was better because it keeps at a good length, with a great storyline and better acting and voices.</fullReview>

After seeing Nicole Kidman's work on this film, I believe she will walk away with the Oscar this year for The Hours (as the Academy sometimes does). Her role was incredible and she did a fantastic job in it. Her singing along with Ewan Macgregor's is amazing. They had so much chemistry going on. I can't believe he was overlooked by the Academy last year! This is a film that explodes with color... and energy.. romance.. despair.. and of course love. I can't say enough about this movie. Yes.. it is an MTV style film, but the editing, the cinematography and originality (even thought they use old songs) are all top rate! I am very glad that I own this film in my DVD collection. 9 stars out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie In The World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is there to say about Moulin Rouge? Well, I could start by saying that, Baz does it right again! Part of Baz's talent is the fact that he can take some of the weirdest subjects in the world and make them into wonderful movies. WONDERFUL movies.Now I know that some critics did not like Moulin Rouge, or Romeo+Juliet, or Strictly Ballroom, but those are movies that you need to see twice before you like them. By the second time, the initial shock is gone.I'll admit, the first time I saw Moulin Rouge; I skipped right to the end when I heard Ewan McGregor say (in the first five minutes) that the woman he loved was dead. The second time I saw it, I watched the entire thing and was blown away. By the third time, I was hooked.Nicole Kidman, who I had never seen in a movie before this, has a wonderful voice, and I think that this movie, a fun, romantic, hilarious movie, must've been good for her considering her recent divorce from Tom Cruise. Her voice blow you away first during `Sparkling Diamonds' and then again during her solo `One Day I'll Fly Away' Though her death scene went on just a bit too long, her performance in this movie was astounding, and thank God the people at MTV have more sense than the Academy, considering she won the MTV Movie Award for Best Actress.Ewan McGregor, Good Lord Ewan McGregor. I had seen him in Star Wars before this, but I had never really known the depth of his acting. Once I saw Moulin Rouge, I was in love. Seriously. For a month, I seriously considered marrying him. That is, until I realized he was already married (that's always the catch isn't it?). I got over that though and I am currently on a mission to see every movie he's been in. Ewan, who really, really, looks good in this movie, can sing better than some of the hot stars now *cough-boy bands-cough-cough-rappers-cough*, makes me want to automatically skip to the `Your Song' scene, just so I can hear his solo.Speaking of, the music of this movie is so.out of this world that, at first glance, it's hard to even realize what it is. Suddenly, Dolly Parton and Elton John are being mixed. Old men in tuxedos are singing Nirvana's `Smells Like Teen Spirit'. Then Zidler and the Duke are singing `Like A Virgin' as though it's a Broadway number. And the mix is perfect. Don't even try messing with it.The best song is `Tango de Roxanne' which is a remake of the Sting song. No offense to Sting, but his version-well-sucked. This version is a mix of a tango and the original song. It starts out with the Narcoleptic Argentinean telling Christian `Never fall in love with a woman who sells herself, it always ends BAD!' Then, he proceeds to sing the song, a haunting rendition, with thirty couples in the background doing the same steps. It truly is the perfect piece to go with the scene which is when *SPOILERS SPOILERS* the Duke realizes that Christian and Satine are in love and tries to rape her. Dark music for a dark scene. Take that people who said that they thought the movie was pointless!If you are a person who never watches a whole movie after twenty minutes, claiming that you disliked the first bit and the rest should be just as bad, stick with Moulin Rouge. Many think that the beginning was stupid and funny, and that the movie must have no worth. The first thirty minutes or so are funny, and needed, so just wait awhile for the seriousness to kick in.And it does get serious. When Christian and Satine are in love, they have to hide that from the overly jealous Duke. Satine has Consumption, and the only cure for that in 1899 was prayer. She had violent coughing fits that left her unconscious and spitting up blood. And the Duke has a violent, possessive temper that results him in ordering his manservant Warner to kill Christian.So it's not a happy movie. But it is. Ewan and Nicole have such great chemistry together that, when she dies you start yelling at the TV-if you have the strength, this death scene will make you cry for ten minutes straight-, `That's not the way it's supposed to end! Satine's supposed to become a great actress, and Christian is supposed to be a great author, and you're supposed to get married and have kids and be happy!' But maybe that's just me. When the two sing, it's like forget the outside world, these two are just too good together.So, go rent Moulin Rouge. It will be the best movie you've seen. I swear to you that it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit, my primary reasoning for seeing this movie was that of a shallow, teenage girl, I mean, Ewan McGregor is....well, HOT!! But once I had seen this masterpiece I knew it was a stroke of genius. The way Baz (yes, we are on a first name basis) mixed contemporary music with such a moving screen play was amazing. Its tone of humor as well as tragedy is what forces me to watch it over and over. And although I can practically speak right along with the movie, I never tire of it. The true talent of Ewan and Nicole (again, first names here) is realized when you find out that every note and every song is actually them singing!!! I have not been this excited about a musical since Phantom of the Opera, yes, it is that level. So, for those who haven't seen it, do, and for those who have seen it, see it again. And again. And again. And then, see it a few more times, just for good measure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There was a film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...a very strange, enchanting film...I was one of the millions of skeptics out there that refused to accept "Moulin Rouge" when it first came out. I, like many, assumed that the movie musical was dead. I was wrong. I recently rented the film on DVD, and now can barely go a day without watching it (now that I bought it on VHS) or listening to the soundtrack. Where to start? Well, for one, Nicole Kidman has shot to the top two or three on my list of favorite actresses. After her amazing role in "The Others," paired with her mesmerizing performance as Satine, the beautiful courtesan in "Moulin Rouge," anyone who doubts her acting chops needs to get their head checked. I've been a fan of Ewan McGregor's for a long time, but it was more of a fan-boy "Star Wars" type of respect. However, now that I've seen him carry himself as a leading man (in a non-indy, non-crappy-horror film), he, too, is now one of my favorites. While a bit crude, his singing voice is amazing. His portion of the "El Tango de Roxanne" sequence is one of the most heart-rending in the entire film, and at the end...well, without giving any spoilers, this hard-hearted movie fan got something in his eye. After seeing his portrayal of Harold Zidler, I'm amazed that Jim Broadbent won his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for "Iris" instead of this. I guess it was a choice between the two roles, and "Iris" was a bit more Academy-friendly, but Zidler was one of the ultimate love-him-AND-hate-him characters put on-screen in a long time. Apparently, I jump to conclusions a lot, because I had John Leguizamo pegged as an annoying little loudmouth. His portrayal of Toulouse Lautrec changed my mind. It was impressive enough that they made him look like a believable dwarf, and that the lisping French accent didn't grate on my nerves, but he carried several key scenes with a strength of character I'd never seen from him. This movie is, to use a worn-out cliche, a roller-coaster of a film. It starts with an almost-ridiculously manic pace, jumping from shot to shot like a Linkin Park music video. Then, there's a wonderful, brief pause (for comic relief) as Christian (McGregor) begins to write his story. "There was only one problem: I'd never been in love!" I can't explain the shot, but it had to have been one of those that Baz Luhrmann came up with over a glass of absinthe. Speaking of absinthe, the manicness of the film picks back up once Christian, Toulouse, the Unconscious Argentinean (possibly my favorite character in the film), and the rest of the Bohemians, have their first taste of the green beverage. After a brief encounter with Kylie Minogue's Green Fairy, they're rocketed into the Moulin Rouge itself where those with weak stomachs probably get nauseous from the frequent camera moves. It is this kind of stop-and-go filmmaking that makes "Moulin Rouge" one of my favorite movies to come out in the last five years. Baz Luhrmann is truly a visionary, and the fact that he was denied a Best Director nomination is sickening. Needless to say, the soundtrack is amazing. In what other movie (other than, perhaps, "A Knight's Tale 2") could you see such an eclectic mix of modern rock transposed back a couple of centuries? Seriously, in 1899, when the word "grunge" still meant dirt, the men at the Moulin Rouge are singing "Smells Like Teen Spirit," while the Diamond Dogs (the club's showgirls) croon "Lady Marmalade" and Satine belts out a medley of "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend" and "Material Girl." From there, Christian serenades Satine with "Your Song," "All You Need Is Love," "Heroes," "Love Lifts Us Up Where We Belong," "Silly Love Songs," and a host of others. But, undoubtedly, the most amazing musical piece in the entire film is when the Unconscious Argentinean, with the help of the wicked (why?) dancer Nene, turns "Roxanne" into a spine-tingling tango. Mixing that song with (what I believe is) an original composition which I can only assume is titled "Why Does My Heart Cry?" lends the scene added potency, making it one of the most surreal musical experiences I've had at a movie since the "Golden Years" scene in "A Knight's Tale" (which I also loved). Isn't it odd that David Bowie's music has been around from the days of jousting, through the Bohemian revolution, up until modern times? I wonder which era were the "Golden Years," exactly. Anyway, I digress. I know I've rambled about this movie for a while, but I definitely think it's worth the words. "Moulin Rouge" is the most visually amazing film I've ever seen, and if last year were not the year of "AKT," this would have been my favorite of the year. So, kudos to Luhrmann, McGregor, Kidman, Broadbent, Leguizamo, and the rest of the people who assembled this truly amazing film. You all deserve a big pat on the back. Ten out of ten, at least.</fullReview>

It's a bit maudlin and the ending goes on too long but full of as much spirit as the last ten movies you've seen. I wouldn't give it any of the major Oscars, (although Luhrmann certainly deserves a nomination). But give it plenty of applause.

		<shortDescription>Who needs a plot when you can have Truth, Beauty, Freedom and Love?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been slated by numerous people for a lack of originality and a feather-weight plot. Both of these criticisms I find hard to fathom. For one thing, I can guarantee that you have never seen a movie like this before, and are unlikely to see anything quite like it again. For another, the entire genre of love stories isn't exactly groaning with stunning and complex plot lines, so why should this one suddenly have to be judged by some monumental standard, particularly when it has so much else to offer?What makes 'Moulin Rouge' so special is not only the much discussed pace of the opening twenty minutes, or the way in which the perfectly chosen songs are fused and reworked into each other and the story, but the performances of the entire cast, from the evident enjoyment they display in the early ensemble scenes through to the love scenes between Ewan McGregor (who has a smile to die for) and Nicole Kidman, both of whom look stunningly beautiful and have real chemistry (they CAN sing too).The film also manages to avoid the law of diminishing returns, with each musical number or emotional twist being bigger/better/funnier/sadder than the last, no mean achievement when you consider the scale of the opening.I don't want to give away any details, so I'll leave it there and just urge everyone to see this film for themselves because it really is worth it - funny, sad, entertaining, overwhelming and very touching. Who needs a hefty plot when faced with all of that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My partner and I went to this film expecting, at the very least, to have an enjoyable time and, based on what we'd heard about it, possibly a 'life-changing experience'.This is the first film for many years where we both decided to walk out before the end.What is it that makes this film so appealing to so many and yet a complete anathema to others? Our taste is broad, we give most cinema a chance to engage and enthrall us, but this just left us looking at our watches and thinking of better things to do.Lavish in production it certainly is, with some clever cinematographic tricks that George Melies himself would have loved, but all this cannot make up for the emptiness of the storyline, the dodgy editing, the lacklustre choreography and the butchered songs.Why do people think Ewan McGregor has a good voice? He hasn't! Are people exposed to so much bad singing nowadays that they've lost all point of reference? Even Nicole Kidman's songs were dubbed in the scenes we saw before our exit.Maybe we missed the point of the whole thing, maybe by not staying for the end we missed some crucial and 'life-changing' finale. Judging by the comments of others like us - who thought this one of the worst films they'd seen for a long time - I don't think so. Even with all the hype, a week after opening the cinema was only about half full on a Saturday night - don't be frightened to stand up and be counted all you other Moulin dissidents!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So this brought back the movie musical? So movies like Chicago Hairspray &amp; Sweeny Todd are all because of this awful movie? Well I have another question: Does Moulin Rouge still hold up after so many years? OF COURSE NOT! It didn't even hold up when it 1st came out. But everyone was amazed with how great and original it is. Yes there's nothing more original the playing songs we all know and love and reusing plot lines the even Twilight would laugh at. (auidence gasps) That right I said it. Twilight is better and more original than this. 1st let me say what I like about it. 1. The movie looks brilliant. 2. The Cinematography is good when you can see it. 3. As the movie goes on the editing does slow down allowing us to see how well the shots are set up. That's all the nice things now let's talk about the bad stuff. 1. The remixes they did aren't good and the only good song is Zidler's Rap. I don't know what it's called but that's the only good song. 2. The editing goes by so fast no shot lasts more than 5 seconds. As the movies goes on it does slow down as I already said. 3. It's loud, stupid and there's no dramatic backing for it in any way. 4. Satine wants something more? What else could she want? To be an actress? Oh yeah this isn't enough. Being hailed as a goddess, men wanting you, women wanting to be you, performing every night to hundreds of people greeting you with applause. Yeah, I can see how being an actress would be ENTIRELY different from this! 5. They use the word love over &amp; over &amp; over and they never explain what it is. We just know that it's really, really good and everyone wants it. They just say the word over and over more than they actually do analyze it. 6. The woman who gave the Duke the hint that Satine and Christian have been seeing each other. WHO THE HELL IS SHE?!?! She's not a main character or side character.7. With the Duke wanting to kill Christian why didn't Zidler get out of the business deal with him? 8. With Satine dying why didn't she tell Christian? Hell why didn't tell the Duke that would probably turn him off! IT MAKES NO SENSE! Hurt him to save him?! THAT'S THE DUMBEST THING I EVER HEARD! All she has to do is tell him the truth and figure out a plan together! How the hell is she saving his life if he's destroying him psychologically? What's worse: dying with the one you love or being emotionally assassinated by that same person. So Satine's breakup with Christian is about as convincing as Edward's breakup with Bella, but thankfully, Christian is about as smart as Bella, so he completely falls for it. 9. Truly in love? That's such bullshit! (mocking) Oh, all you need is love lovelovelovelove...Who treated anyone they truly loved this way? Why would you slutshame her in front of an entire audience of people? Who calls that love? That's not love, that's bitterness! Oh sure, her actions are abjectly stupid and she's the victim of bad, stupid writing. But him? He's just despicable! He's evil! For as many times as he sings about LOOOOVE, he treats her in the most insulting, dirty, mean-spirited way that you can treat a human being. And the dwarf's over here like "Oh, she wouldn't do that!" and yet him, the one that's in love with her can't figure this out? "Oh yeah, love! I forgot about that! That's right! I'M SORR...you know what, I'm not even sorry, but we're still in love. SO LET'S SING ABOUT IT! In front of everyone and everything's okay! Oh wait, you're dead. Awww." How would you feel if your loved one had some stupid misunderstanding that sprung from bad writing and then threw out all of their negative, horrible bile in one fell swoop...IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY! 10. So just as Christian gets done calling her every word for "whore" in the English language, the dwarf suddenly drops down and--what a shock--quotes more songs. So the whore he said he would never be manipulated by is now letting himself be manipulated by, it just so happens that she's telling the truth? Singing fixes everything. F*CK THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible, John Huston rolls in his grave!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is evidently meant to be a more light-hearted telling of a dramatic and tragic tale told previously before on film, most notably by the great John Huston back in the 50s. However, as with his other films, Baz Luhrmann's incessant need to be overly colorful, poorly acted, and schticky in a passé manner overshadow anything resembling a story. This is one of Ewan MacGregor's worst performances, mostly because his singing isn't that great. Not his fault, I can't sing either. Nicole Kidman was pretty good, but again, she can be so much more than this. All of the actors in the film have done much better work, with the exception of Leguizamo's previous foray into Luhrmann's twisted little corner of lame, William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (funny, I was IN a production of Romeo and Juliet, and I don't remember Shakespeare having Romeo take ecstasy or Juliet SHOOT HERSELF IN THE HEAD!) While the visual spectacle of the film may have been wildly colorful and flashy, no amount of set design and effects take away from the fact that the story was poorly told, and that many of the scenes seemed to have more to do with Luhrmann wanting a certain song to be in the film than any sort of continuity. I'd recommend anyone to stay away from this drivel, see Huston's film and you'll know what I mean.</fullReview>

The music is great and the vocal talents are amazing.The actress that stands out in this film is the gorgeous Nicole Kidman. She acts, sings and dances superbly! Ewan too stands out but not as much as Nicole. I must admit I never knew that either of them could sing.The choreography to every dance was great. The dance that stands out for me is the Can Can.Overall this is an Excellent film with the actors, sets, dances and music all working Superbly. Buy or rent this film.

		<fullReview>If you found Moulin Rouge unlikeable you are either: a) an idiot b) have no appreciation for a fantastic work of art c) an idiot or d) obviously missed the bigger picture of what the film was about.All of you who are sitting there criticizing the film because it has 'songs mixed together' or find the 'plot laughable' truly have not looked beneath the surface of the film. The meaning and messages that Luhrman presents are so significant and important in the world today that it would be stupid to dismiss them.The film is not just about Love and Lost (which I'm sure many of you found corny anyway) but it is also about how giving one's heart and soul to a single purpose will eventually mean overcoming everything. this is not just with Love but with all quests. Although there is loss along the way, eventually the truth really will set you free.The fact that Lurhman teamed the fantastic plot with such a great set up including the music, the cast, the set - hell the whole concept is just fantastic - makes it even more Spectacular.I truly think all of you so called 'critics' out there need to sit down and watch the movie again and not have such a closed mind about it. Be open to the underlying meanings and who knows - you might even learn something about what it takes to make a fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Buffet for the Senses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The exclamation point following the title in "Moulin Rouge!" is justly deserved, but barely begins to convey the level of excitement achieved in this film. Viewers seem to be evenly divided into two camps (with no middle ground) - those who dismiss it as a loud, excessive exercise in over-the-top movie-making, and the rest - like myself - who embrace it for its style, its imagination, its movement, its passion. Like a three-ring circus, it presents an overabundance of frenetic action that's impossible to absorb in one sitting. If ever a film demanded multiple viewings in order to appreciate it fully, "Moulin Rouge!" is it.Screenwriters Craig Pearce and Buz Luhrmann - who also directed - previously teamed for "Strictly Ballroom" and "Romeo + Juliet," both cult favorites in their own right. Here they have selected the famed Paris nightspot, synonymous with extravagant entertainment and unbridled debauchery, to serve as the backdrop for what is, in essence, a simple love story. At the turn of the century - 19th rolling over into 20th - Christian, a penniless poet, arrives in Paris determined to establish himself as a writer. At first glance he is mesmerized by Satine, an elegant courtesan and leading attraction at the Moulin Rouge, who wants nothing more than to be a "real actress." Duc de Monroth, more familiarly known as the Duke, appears to be the wealthy means by which she can fulfill her dream, but at a price higher than she may be willing to pay. She initially scoffs at the attentions of the young writer, reminding him he can ill afford her, but she finds the pure love he offers to be more attractive than the success she could find in the arms of the lecherous nobleman. Ultimately, she will have little say in her fate, as consumption slowly saps her strength and illness invades her fragile body.In fleshing out their tale, Pearce and Luhrmann have borrowed from a grab bag of eclectic storytelling traditions. Their script embraces the pathos of Puccini's grand operas, the cases of mistaken identity found in Shakespeare's comedies of errors, and turns to more contemporary influences such as the madcap adventures of the Marx Brothers, Lucy and Ethel's convoluted plotting, and the spectacle of Bollywood musicals. All of this is highlighted by a score of 20th Century music from talents as diverse as Rodgers and Hammerstein, Paul McCartney, Madonna, and the Pointer Sisters. Christian and Satine's duet of a medley of popular love songs on the roof of the nightclub is pure magic.Magic is the keyword here. Everything seems to have sprung from a giddily gaudy land of make-believe where anything can happen, and often does. Satine's first entrance at the Moulin Rouge is seen through the eyes of Christian and his newly-found cohorts, all of them mind-tripping after consuming absinthe, and the spectacle is a dazzling array of sound and color and feverish movement as the camera spins through the crowd to capture every corner of the room and every person inhabiting it. At their first meeting in Satine's dressing room, she mistakenly believes Christian's wish to recite poetry is an unusual prelude to sex, and she writhes and moans in a faked display of passion until he, totally perplexed, blurts out the opening lines of Elton John's "Your Song." What follows is an exquisite rendition of the song that takes them out the window and into the night sky of Paris, where they dance among the clouds and waltz around the top of the Eiffel Tower. The camera-work here and throughout is spectacular. Much credit is due the film editors and special effects team, as well, for their often dizzying but never dull contributions that keep the film in a state of perpetual motion, and to the costume and set designer and art director for filling every scene with a visual smörg?sbord to delight the senses.Nicole Kidman previously had proved her worth as an actress in the delicious "To Die For," but here her performance as Satine establishes her as a full-fledged STAR. Finally fully dashing out of the shadows long cast on her by husband Tom Cruise, she illuminates the screen with both her beauty and unmistakable talents for comedy, drama, and music. As remarkable as she was in the following year's "The Hours," her Academy Award-worthy performance is the one she offers here. Ewan McGregor is delightfully surprising as Christian, proving himself to be a charming romantic lead and a very capable singer. Kudos also to John Leguizamo, who endows the diminutive Henri Toulouse-Lautrec with a deep sadness hidden behind his live-for-life demeanor; Jim Broadbent, for his no-holds-barred portrayal of the heart and soul of the Moulin Rouge, the impresario for whom belief in true love ultimately overshadows a need for financial gain; and Richard Roxburgh, whose finely-etched performance of the Duke allows him to fumble his way through a myriad of emotions as his unrequited passion for Satine slowly evolves into a realization that he's been made the fool.I have found it impossible to convince those who failed to appreciate "Moulin Rouge!" to give it another chance, but those of us who have returned to it multiple times tend to discover a previously unnoticed bit of business as we try to keep pace with the frenetically moving camera. This is that rare film that grows richer with each viewing, one that set a standard to which all future movie musicals should be held.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The writing left a bit to be desired. Not great as a whole, some of the scenes are even painful stretches. But other moment of this film compensate greatly. What a wonderful escape. Telouse was annoying, but I loved the rest of the Characters, I wonder if the actors were working together, of if Baz Luhrmann told each of them a different style to go for.  The most visually delicious movie I have seen in forever. It is like any old hollywood musical in that is completely presentational, but what fun. Better than anything else I've seen in years. The fact that the movie is so polarizing speaks highly of director. People love it, or hate it. That's because unlike most directors, Baz Lurhmann did not back down. He gave us the story the way he wanted to. Without comprimise. Not worried about trying to please everyone. The result is that the people who don't get it, never will, but for the people who do, it's a true treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people I heard of, think that Moulin Rouge, is a boring and stupid film... Why? I believe it is a "one of a kind" musical. The special combination of old and well-known songs but also the re-making of famous old songs is amazing! It is one of the best, if not the best, musicals I've ever seen... Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are indeed very talented at singing, dancing and acting... Baz is an excellent director with a lot of talent, knowing his work pretty well. All the other cast and crew worked really hard to make a musical that will entertain people and they succeeded, in my opinion. I also love the way they combined music, comedy, action and drama. There are scenes you really laugh your head off and scenes the feel like crying your heart out. I was reading the biography of "Henry Marie Raymond de Toulouse Lautrec Monfa", the famouse french artist, and most of the story is based on his life (something really smart to do). The one's that believe that Moulin Rouge!'s music is crap, well sorry folks, but I got to tell you that you are wrong... The music is entertaining and so is the movie...Thank youRATING= 9,5/10 95/100 19/20</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where did the idea come from that singing the first line of as many different songs as possible constitutes a "Medley?" Or that using, out of context, the most popular hits from Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein and other great song writers is acceptable? I was constantly hoping that they would complete at least one piece of music besides "The Sound of Music" and that Elton John thing; but no, they kept reciting bits and snatches of recent (and not so recent) pop songs ad infinitum - I wanted to tear my hair out after hearing nothing but sound bites of old favorites for what seemed like five minutes without a break. And the Folies Bergere &amp; Busby Berkeley cliches - this is not a movie for anyone with musical theater taste of ANY kind, only musical illiterates could like this piece of crap. Not that Ewan McGregor or Nicole Kidman were bad... they did far more than then material asked for. Also John Leguizamo was better than perfect as Toulouse Latrec, if one can use such a phrase.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge! has one of the most simple stories I know but it comes in the most beautiful package I can imagine. Almost nothing is new in the movie, but all that old stuff together is one of the most original things I have seen.We have a forbidden love packed in a movie musical. All the songs used sound familiar but totally new at the same time. We hear a beautiful version of Your Song from Elton John and a refreshing version of Roxanne from The Police. We hear so much more songs we recognize but don't know. The only original song, Come What May, is a beautiful one as well. The actors all do their own singing. It is terrific.Sometimes the screen seems hectic, but it is all in favor of the atmosphere of the movie. Nicole Kidman is gorgeous and great in her part as Satine, the courtisane who falls in love with the poor writer. Ewan McGregor is that writer and he as well does a tremendous job. I loved the supporting roles: John Leguizamo as Toulouse, Richard Roxburgh as the Duke who wants Satine because he pays for the new play they will do in the Moulin Rouge, and especially Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler, the boss of the Moulin Rouge.The story doesn't matter very much, it is the way the whole movie is brought to us. In living colors, with bright actors, terrific settings and costumes, perfect voices for beautiful songs, a sharp cinematography, all put together by a very good director, Baz Luhrmann. The movie musical is back and if you need some evidence, watch Moulin Rouge! 10/10.</fullReview>

It defies cinematic convention, and instead delivers one of the most inspiring pieces of entertainment that I've seen in a very long time. It grabs a hold of your spirit and takes it on one of the wildest rides around. Nicole Kidman and Ewan Macgregor literally light up the screen, and they can really sing! The use of contemporary music in a musical period piece is brilliant! The cinematography is amazing, and the visual effects are captivating. At the heart of this artistic masterpiece is simply a tale of truth, beauty, freedom, and above all love. And boy is it fun! Kudos to Baz Luhrmann! For the first time in a long time, I left the movie theater with the feeling that someone had actually made some effort to challenge my senses! Warning: If you've become accustomed to the regurgitated rubbish that hollywood has been putting out lately, you might be put off by Moulin Rouge's ORIGINALITY! On the other hand, if you're feelingadventurous, take a chance on Moulin Rouge. It's different, but that's a good thing.</fullReview>

The movie settled down thereafter, but never decided what it wanted to be. A contemporary Disney musical, done live action? A Pythonesque chaotic farce? A dark tragedy? A show piece for how good Nicole Kidman looks under colored filters? A ploy for Oscars for production values?Look, Python could have done its bits twice as well at a tenth the budget. In the meantime, while Obi-Wan sang credibly, I pay $8.50 a shot to see professional performers performing professionally - amateur hour we see for free on local cable - although poor Kidman was born 50 years too late to be the musical superstar she may have been. MacGregor sang as well as Travolta did in Grease, and that's all the praise he merits.(Meanwhile, did anyone notice that for all the money spent, not one thin dime went to anyone who could dance a lick? Vaudeville dancing WAS slightly more than flipping skirts to show skin while legs kicked spasmodically in random directions. Props to the director for the quick cuts to make it tough to notice how poorly executed the dancing was)Top 250 of all time? Bah. This movie was no better, in the end, than the bottom five movies I've paid to see. That list includes Moment By Moment, The Last Temptation of Christ, Plan Nine From Outer Space, and Sgt.

		<fullReview>They call this a musical but the leading actors can't sing or dance. The music (totally unoriginal and stolen) has been rearranged to lob off the tops and bottoms so that this troop no-talents can make their notes. The result is a score as flat as a possum on a Texas highway - and the movie stinks just as much. You can hear better singing in the average shower in any home in America. Much has been made that this is Kidman's first singing effort and you can tell that she is no singer. The same applies to the dancing. You never see their feet at critical times. One person in our audience stormed out the front and slammed the door about 15 minutes into the show. I applaud her judgment and only wish I had joined her. I frequent the arts, movies and musicals. The Sound of Music was a musical, Grease was a musical and even Rocky Horror Picture Show was a musical. This was a nauseating piece of crap that made me want to run for the door to purge myself of the vile pollution of song, dance and acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky Horror Show at Studio 54</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having loved Strictly Ballroom, I was looking forward to seeing this film. I could see what the director was trying to do: The Rocky Horror Show at Studio 54 as performed by Monty Python's Flying Circus, with scenes from "Oh What a Lovely War" and "Peter Pan" thrown in for good measure, but I found it a bit too much. The colors were too vivid, the editing nauseatingly fast, the sound system seemed to have blown a fuse, and the pathetic mewing of the two leads made me nostalgic for the great days of Howard Keel and Katherine Grayson. What ever happened to singing lessons or dubbing? The singing was too week and the songs too brief for me to recognize any of the songs. I kept wondering who had given Baz Luhrman all that money to make this film. I like both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, but I did get tired of seeing close ups of ghostly pale Nicole's smudged scarlet lipstick, and listening to her flat Australian twang. OK, I'm picky picky, but with the money she earns she could afford to take elocution and singing lessons. The file had one truly superb scene for me: the violent Tango/Apache Dance which no low dive in Paris was ever without. It is many years since I saw one and this was excellent. The other dance scenes of the Can Can were far too brief but what little glimpse we had showed it as it likely was rather than the dressed up "tourist version". The choreography, costumes and set design were all that made this movie bearable for me. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be easier to "relax and enjoy myself" if my visceral reaction wasn't one of a revulsion at the lack of originality (yes, I know how many seem to view this as "original", "brilliant", "dazzling", "visually stunning", et al [or more appropriately, ad nauseum]). Sticking modern pop songs in a movie about 19th century Paris doesn't cut it as original. Neither does quoting 3 different pop "definitions" of love (twice), "Love is like oxygen. Love is a many-splendored thing. Love lifts us up where we belong" and treating it within the movie as the world's most beautiful poetry while winking at the audience who know their origins. Plus for something to be visually stunning, the human eye would need to focus on an image for more than the 2-second instances Luhrmann gives the audience. All this added up to a director who was afraid to tell a story rather than a daring artist "reinventing" cinema or a movie genre. Luhrmann's use of these pop songs and quick edits were cheap devices and distractions that kept me from relating to the characters or caring for them for one second. In a word: bad; in five words: bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.</fullReview>

It isn't. It's just bad cinema. Baz Lurhmann has, like lots of other ambitious amateurs, a sort of "horror vacui". He has absolutely no comprehension of what to leave out, so he just throws it all in an attempt to cover up the fact that he doesn't know what he is doing.Please, please, please if you enjoyed this swill, watch the following as some sort of remedial treatment course to see what the TRUE masters of glorious excess are capable of. Watch Busby Berkeley. Watch Vincente Minelli. Watch Ken Russell (anyone who sniggers at that suggestion yet can still embrace Lurhmann is kidding themselves). Watch Dennis Potter. Watch Bob Fosse. Watch (selected) Alan Parker. Don't accept pale imitations!!!Above all, probably the biggest crime of this film is what could have been.

		<shortDescription>A choppy, hackneyed mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I was going to be charitable, I'd take into consideration that Baz Luhrmann is not a cinematic director, and most of his experience comes from the theater. Unfortunately, given that Luhrmann did prove that he was capable of making a somewhat competent film with Romeo + Juliet, he gets no sympathy. Luhrmann acts like a child given a complex new toy with no instructions how to use it. Throughout the history of filmmaking, directors influence the attention of the audience by letting the actors' performance naturally become the focus of a scene; Luhrmann apparently regards his actors as too bland or his audience as too dim to understand where attention must be paid. To that end, every single scene is a mess of jump cuts, overused camera tricks and forced, ham-fisted acting. Shaky/walking cam? Check. Lens flares? Cartoonish sound effects? Soft focus? Multiple angles of the same scene? D-r-a-m-a-t-i-c-a-l-l-y s-l-o-w-e-d d-o-w-n m-o-v-e-m-e-n-t and RAPIDLYSPEDUPACTION? Fade-ins, fade-outs repeatedly breaking the fourth wall? Check, check, double-check. All of these happening once in a movie is enough to wreck it, but these happen so often it's as if Luhrmann was just goofing around in a consumer-level video editing software with a bunch of footage from other films.The result is not a fulfilling journey into an otherworldly and hallucinogenic world, but a wearying, tedious slog through a vile bastardization of turn-of-the-millennium pop culture and hackneyed film tricks.It's not even campy fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The liner notes on the back of the DVD were very accurate: one said something like "there's never been a movie like this," and it was quite true. I have no idea what I had expected in this show, but it was not a cross between a musicale and an opera, with flights of fantasies between animated and live scenes, a lot of screaming and running around, and general chaos.There was quite a bit of pop music (oldies in 2006) which was not written when Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was alive, and seemed like a cheap way to import music into the show. The original music was interesting, and Ewan Mc Gregor is cute and apparently able to sing! I will look for other movies of his.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is , at this moment, my favourite film. It's got everything. Firstly, Nicole Kidman, I know it's been said before, but she was born to play this part - she looks sumptuous, acts well and sings well. Ewen Mcgregor, ditto, but for the ladies.The film is a visual feast, especially the first 45mins - perhaps if there is a fault it is here, with a little too much going on on screen.The costumes and settings are stupendous.The music is brilliant, taking standard popular music and presenting them in a musical context - so even if you're not in to musicals, please do not let the tag 'musical' put you off - there's covers of Trex, Bowie, Elton John all superbly done.There's humour, pathos, melodrama, delivered with brilliant timing by all the cast.So if you like beautiful women, handsome men, a good pantomime baddie, great music and a visual feast, you needn't look anywhere else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an utterly horrible, misguided film! I just got the double-DVD edition of this from you local library and I feel very fortunate to be able to devolve it as fast as possible.Other reviewers, thank God, have had the good taste of recognizing the intrinsic flaws of this flick (pun intended). It's out of any gender and type, out of context, to be true. Nothing is respected, neither the time this story is supposed to have happened, nor the music, nor anything. It's just a shrill, nincompoop attempt at assaulting our senses and our taste by a totally, fundamentally, inept director. One should really prohibit him from working, he's certainly better at selling hot dogs than making films! Well, it's ten years the flick was made. It seems to have gained a certain "cult" status, but very undeservedly so in my opinion. Taste is difficult, albeit impossible to discuss, the Latin proverb says is, but nevertheless I had to get rid of my bad feelings about this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dull musical with some truly bad music.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visually impressive - though unfortunately over reliant on red - musical that seems to drift in a Netherworld between very broad comedy and romantic drama. Too long, and quite full of dull dialogues with most supporting characters overacting their asses off. The musical numbers are mostly forgettable, occasionally even awful - like the rape of "Roxanne", the idiotic version of "Smells Like Teen Spirit", the dried up and never-has-been-good, tedious "Madame Chocolat" (or whatever the hell it's called), and the utterly hopeless choice of one or two Madonna(!) songs. Talk about bad taste. Another musical problem is Nicole Kidman's voice, which is clearly quite inferior to McGregor's surprisingly solid voice; she doesn't so much sing as she whispers - a true mark of someone with a weak voice. The "whisper cop-out" is often used by women who try to disguise the fact that their voice doesn't measure up. This never becomes more obvious than when the two leads sing together; she simply pales by comparison. Also, the two have been mismatched: 1) she is older than him, 2) he is charismatic, she isn't, and 3) most importantly, she is a head taller. McGregor is charismatic, but he can't help this movie much. And how's that last "message" we get at the very end of the end-credits: "truth", "beauty", and "above all... love". How profound and how friggin' touching'. Come on everybody, let's all sing bad 80s/90s hits (or 80s/90s hits covered badly) and pull out our handkerchiefs and whimper a lot. Still, it could be worse: it could be "Chicago".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cringed throughout this film. How on earth could it have been made? Who could possibly enthuse about it? The cast looked as embarrassed as I felt for them.God preserve us from Hollywood plundering the past; from unoriginality, from remakes and from travesties such as this! Bury it please in a deep hole.Unfortunately I was on a flight somewhere when this film was aired. I survived merely by the expedient of disconnecting the headphones.Anyone ever see the British TV sitcom "Goodnight Sweetheart" starring Nicholas Lyndhurst? Well - it was pretty much like that; 'modern' songs reused in an historical backdrop. It doesn't work. Ever. m No disrespect to Mr Lyndhurst and his writers: the plot of the TV series is somehow explicable and works - in a way. "Moulin Rouge" doesn't. Full stop. End of story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly the worst movie of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann makes Ed Wood look like Truffaut. At least Wood had no budget as an excuse. Luhrmann has made a movie of pseudo-pop style and absolutely no substance, a piece of frivolous camp which makes the fatal mistake of taking itself seriously. You are better off renting Rocky Horror Picture Show and watching an honest work of cinema.The film is a derivative, cliche-ridden two-hour music video. It has little to do with the real Moulin Rouge, either in setting, history, or people. Yes, we see Monte Martre and a red windmill, but they are scarcely recognizable after the computer animators got through with them.The script is absolutely dreadful, with no perceptible distinction between scenes of comedy and attempted pathos. The only clues we are given by the director are via his knee-jerk invocation of passe cinematic devices, like when doomed heroine Kidman repeatedly falls to the floor in skip-frame slow-mo. Otherwise, the characters whoosh around with cartoon sound effects, like Wile E. Coyote, making them less than one-dimensional -- a fractal dimension of about 0.3, perhaps."Moulin Rouge" will probably be remembered in film history as the apex of the "auteur gone wild with cash" period of the turn of the 21st century. It is destined to be shown in film schools as one of the finest examples of how not to make a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading the reviews so far I am beginning to suspect that there are two versions of this movie out there and that I got to see the blooper roll. What I saw was annoying, without any intelligent story and just plain stupid. When we rented the DVD, we were expecting a musical, a love story and a piece of history from one of my favorite cities in the world, Paris. It turned out to be a loud and irritating collage of sound bites and visuals. This can only qualify as a musical for the MTV generation, with the attention span of a gerbil on speed. Seriously, even most of the "dialogues" and songs were not original but collected from eras of pop and rock music. I tried to like this movie and a number of friends have tried to explain to me what they love about it. It didn't work. Needless to say I was shocked to see it nominated for best film and was greatly relieved when it didn't win.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is about the worst movie I've ever seen. It was like being trapped on a cruise ship and forced to watch one of their awful cabaret shows where everybody is singing at you constantly. Moreover, all of the songs, the story and everything else in the movie is about love. It is highly repetitious and overly sappy. It makes an obvious and weak attempt to pull you down emotionally and then lift you back up. It never worked for me. The plot was too transparent, and it happened in microcosmic waves that repeatedly hit you in the face over and over again to the point where you can no longer stand Elton John's wonderful song, "You're Song"--or whatever it's called. Apart from a few mildly humorous moments and the sight of Nicole Kidman (better to see Eyes Wide Shut for that) the movie was greatly disappointing.</fullReview>

One of the worst things about a film like this is that after watching it, you may never again be able to speak to people you know that did like it.This film is nothing short of a crime against humanity. Not only are the characters utterly undeveloped, there is no plot (I repeat, there is absolutely no plot), it is an utter failure as a musical. The majority of the musical pieces are bastardised versions of contemporary pop (eg Smells Like Teen Spirit - so pretentious, it makes Tony Blair look genuine) and the original pieces are as nauseating as medium rare chicken breast sandwich.The director might as well just have filmed himself masturbating. That goes for the rest of the crew, cast and production team.I would rather mate with some fevered Turkish wild fowl than watch this travesty again.</fullReview>

Make it a "musical" by borrowing a bunch of sappy, irrelevant, historically inappropriate pop songs and wedging them into the "plot". Hire a couple of currently popular movie actors - singing ability not important. Add gobs of garish production, film effects and computer graphics.

The film is a showy pastiche of musical snippets from a variety of sources. The performances have little life to them and absolutely no emotional depth. However, it is one of the few musicals produced at all in the past couple of decades. Since the AFI "experts" seem to have only a superficial knowledge of films prior to 1960, this gets the film in the top 25. A similar pattern of temporal bias afflicts most of the other AFI lists.

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge makes one wonder what happened to Baby Jane. Whatever became of fun &amp; entertainment? Even art (the so-called ?septi?me art') now seems to bow to post-modernist ego trips. From beginning to end, this film is an amazing lesson on how NOT to make movies. No kidding, Kidman, I really intend to incorporate it into my film classes: it exemplifies bad acting, bad directing, bad pseudo ?low key' photography, bad pseudoperiod sets, waste of money, feature-sized video clip aesthetics , and last but not least poor storytelling, or rather non-existing storytelling. It does defy not only cinematic conventions but also common sense, the Eisenstein theory of montage plus, incidentally, the spectator's tolerance, by delivering a most uninspired piece of boredom. It does take you on one of the wildest rides around a filmmaker ego. What happened to talent? Kidman and MacGregor have hardly been worse, and of course they can neither dance nor sing! Jim Broadbent is good, but even ?Bridget Jones' is an immensely superior movie. The use of Richard Rodgers, Jule Styne, Offenbach and other Baz' schmaltzy dated conceptions can only appeal to the self-indulgent spectator craving for arty crafts. The Tim Burton-like ?dark' cinematography is technically incompetent. It obliges to such an abominable aesthetics which video clips have been doing their best to impose upon mainstream cinema for about 20 years now. The visual effects are expensive, I'll say that. Kidman, by the way, seems to be a unique champion of some among the dearest of turkeys in movie history, as witnessed by ?Portrait of a lady' and ?Far and away.' Oddly enough, she was also in ?Eyes wide shut', ?To die for' and other genuine examples of exceptional filmmaking. At the heart of this sub-artistic would-be masterpiece is simply good old Dumas' Camille (Marguerite Gautier) dying of consumption within a tale of melodrama, bourgeois decadence and, of course, sex. Boy, is it crude, thick pricks jokes and so forth! Kudos to Baz Luhrman! Not since the days of Lina Wertmuller and Anthony Newley and I left the theatre with the feeling that someone actually meant to mystify me by creating? mystification! Warning: If you ever were in touch with studio-system artistic giants such as Ford, Hitchcock, Griffith and you name it which Hollywood sponsored during last century, you may be put off by Moulin Rouge's uniqueness! John Huston's Moulin Rouge was brilliant, though its leading hero, Toulouse-Lautrec was a grotesque figure. Jean Renoir's French Cancan was lively, equally brilliant and musically rich. To the point. This Moulin Rouge, an homage to post-modern grotesquery, is simply grotesque , and its ?Toulouse' character, simple debauchery. Obnoxious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd rather enjoyed Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, I'd been overwhelmed by the gaudiness of Strictly Ballroom but somehow also managed to find some mindless entertainment in that... but I am sorry to say I won't be anywhere near as generous with Moulin Rouge. Some adoring reviewers here have claimed this film has revealed the endless possibilities of cinema to them. I must then think that they haven't seen very many films in their lives, seeing as Moulin Rouge does nothing but pick 'n mix then regurgitate with an extra helping of gorgonzola from films and genres that have been seen, digested and assimilated many, many times before. Except the now-obligatory post-modern irony isn't even in this mish-mash, as the two leads - Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in particular - are so totally devoid of any ability to do irony, you'll end up with tooth decay at the end of this schmaltzy ride. Kidman and her button nose, which prevents her from looking anything but pretty but never beautiful (as this film would have us believe), is probably one of the most actory actresses working in Hollywood today. Her performances go through all the motions - see her Oscar-winning performance in The Hours, for instance, where she showed us what a mentally disturbed, brooding artist does, at least externally - without ever reaching anything resembling the SOUL of her character. In this sense, when comparing Julianne Moore's unforgettable performance to Kidman's in the same film, you understand in what ways she could also be viewed as unconvincing as the doomed courtesan Satine in Moulin Rouge. As for McGregor, who was supposed to be playing a young Londoner (with an awfully good Scottish accent for someone from so far South in the UK!), his Christian had a little more integrity, but way too much sap. Watching such a man declare his undying love to me would probably make me feel like the most unromantic, irreverent and callous woman in matters of love! The film itself, essentially an old-fashioned musical with no original songs and a few clever gimmicks to give it a superficial modern veneer, will probably date very quickly. Whoever will be watching it in, say, the year 2020 won't help noticing how turn-of-the-century it is. A film which uses popular culture references for a greater, more timeless purpose rather than being used BY them, will probably stand the test of time. Not so a film which does nothing but wink and nudge the spectator all the way through just to show how up-to-date with all the latest, late 90s, trendy pop references such as MTV-style cinematography, Bollywood movie aesthetics, Kylie Minogue and the "naughty" and Bohemian use of absinthe (which had a revival in the late 90s)... Even the big, turn-of-the-century New Year's bash... a direct reference to the MTV generation's own 1999. **SPOILERS AHEAD** One scene I found particularly ridiculous was the one in which the ruddy-cheeked, mustachioed Cockney (in Paris!) impresario Jim Broadbent (only superficially reprising his much more interesting role from Topsy Turvy), tells Nicole's Satine she's dying of consumption (tuberculosis for you and I). He does this as a last resort to convince her once and for all that she must give up her true love, the impoverished writer Christian and sleep with the evil Duke so that he'll sponsor the Moulin Rouge and her acting career. When Satine hears this shocking bit of news about her health, she reluctantly agrees to going along with her impresario's wish. I'll explain why I think this scene is ridiculous: if anyone has ever known someone who's had to go through the unspeakable pain of discovering they have a terminal illness, they will know that Satine's reaction - agreeing to give up her love for Christian - is psychologically the least credible thing she could have done. Exactly because she knew she had so little to live, what really matters most in life would suddenly have come into sharp focus for her. She'd have wanted to spend her last period alive doing exactly what she had always wished for and what was really worthwhile - not pretending to love someone she despised in order to further someone else's business interests! As for her own business interests, what would they matter if she knew she was dying? **END OF SPOILERS** Speaking of the Duke and the way the evil, upper-class patron was portrayed in Moulin Rouge - he made the whole film so similar to Titanic in my eyes. Not unlike that other gargantuan cheese-platter, Moulin Rouge's poor were the generous, creative, lively, warm, vibrant salt-of-the-earth types to its cold, heartless, snobbish, evil rich. Moulin Rouge and Titanic portray class differences in a manner so simplistic, I wonder why more people didn't feel insulted by such an affront to their intelligence.Other majorly irritating elements about Moulin Rouge besides the... er... choice of music were some of the supporting characters, John Leguizamo as Toulouse-Lautrec in the front row. A lisping, simpering fool played by an actor of average stature unconvincingly walking on his knees.... It makes one balk just to think he was meant to portray one of France's legendary Belle Epoque artists, one whose artistic heritage embodies that time in the French capital like few others. Yet here he was, reduced to no more than a cutesy, Disney animal side-kick so he could be fed to the MTV generation without turning them off from the historic/cultural baggage that would come with such a figure normally! My final words on Moulin Rouge are that if I'm going to watch a gaudy, noisy song-and-dance with funny characters talking in silly voices, give me the original Muppet Show series any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What you need to know about this film is that it is all about love. It is a story of lust, greed, jealousy and music, music expresses what words cannot and that is shown throughout this film. From beginning to end, I was completely captivated and this was because it was so quirky and beautifully scripted that I felt I was a part of the Moulin Rouge. Baz Luhrmann directed and helped write this musical and I have always been a big fan of his work.. The protagonists Satine (Nicole Kidman) and Christian (Ewan McGregor) are the unlucky and unlikely lovers as Satine mistakenly assumes that Christian is the Duke (Richard Roxburgh). Christian is in fact a young writer who travelled from London to Paris in search of inspiration and maybe love and Satine is the 'Sparkling Diamond' of the club who catches the eye of both Chrstian and the Duke. Satine wants to seduce the Duke so he can give her wealth but also help her to achieve her dream of being an actress. Early on we can tell that the two men will be fighting over Satine but it seems a greater threat is at large. The film takes its inspiration from 20th century music specifically love songs and even creates a medley of many popular love songs of the century. One thing I do love about this film is the soundtrack, the music intertwines perfectly with the plot and it really does help into showing us the characters true intentions.Obviously not every film is perfect and this film has its flaws but I think that is what makes it so honest and their love so captivating. The cinematography and the editing is beautifully composed, very quirky and quite dark for a film of this genre.Overall this film is a must see if you are a fan of romance, drama, comedy and above all else music. Also if you are a fan of Baz Luhrmann then I would definitely put this film on my 'To See' list.RJ x</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this for the first time a couple of years ago after turning it off after about 10 minutes and I've only just recently tried to watch it again - now I love it! :-) At first it's a little fast paced and it's definitely something that grows on you in time, the more you watch it and get included into the sad yet beautiful story of the Moulin Rouge! Ewan McGregor's performance in this is super and he has such a lovely voice. You get attached to the characters quickly and get sent on an emotional roller- coaster which may or may not result in tears - it did for me! Overall, it's amazing, the storyline, the cast, the imagination, the songs!The show must go on :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge! was on TV last night, and since I hadn't seen it in ages I decided to watch it. The story of Moulin Rouge! is quite simple when you think about it. But it's not just the story, there are of course other elements, like the bohemian revolution, and the characters' quest to have truth, beauty freedom and love in their play. And while the love story is simple, combined with everything else that's happening in the movie makes Moulin Rouge! quite unique, and clearly it stands out from the romance genre. While the story is of course tragic, Luhrmann and Pearce didn't make it just tragic. Moulin Rouge! is beautiful, lovely, tragic and hilarious. Moulin Rouge! is actually pretty wild, The shots and special effects alone make it so, but also the humour is amazing. There's a lot of misunderstandings and second-hand embarrassment, and so many other ways it's amazing. Especially the beginning of the movie is extremely wild, and it brings out the contrast between the tragedy of the movie.One of the strengths in Moulin Rouge! is the visual side of the film. It's extremely colourful and very detailed. Many of the set designs are extremely detailed - in fact they are so detailed, there's no point even trying to see every detail in certain rooms etcetera. Also a lot of scenes consist of extremely fast and short shots. That's usually fine by me, it creates a nice effect, but in some parts they are used way too much. Sometimes it hard to concentrate and focus because the shots don't necessarily flow so nicely. But still, that is just one thing, because otherwise the cinematography in this film is almost perfect.The music is beyond amazing! I have the soundtrack and I love each and every song on that soundtrack. They take songs from our time and put them in 1899, that's just amazing. My absolute favourite is El Tango De Roxanne, because they way the song Roxanne is turned into something completely knew is so effective, almost surprising every time I watch this movie. Also the choreography and the visual side of the scene during El Tango De Roxanne is just amazing. Apart from that I can not say which song is my favourite, because every song is so amazing. Sparkling Diamonds, Elephant Love Medley, Come What May, Someday I'll Fly Away... All those are magnificent!When you don't watch Moulin Rouge! for along time, you might forget about its charm. Maybe it's also because now I'm older, but Moulin Rouge! is probably one of my favourite musicals. Every part of this movie works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of Moulin Rouge begins with a despaired young man, Christian, typing at his typewriter, alone in a dark, shabby apartment he clicks away the tragedy that the audience is about to watch. Flashing back he runs into others in his building he is convinced to write a play for the famous Moulin Rouge, a nightclub in Paris. There he is mesmerized by Satine, the star of the show, and that night they begin their elusive love affair that would eventually bring down the walls of conventional romance. Although they attempt to keep it secret they can't hide their feelings from themselves or others around them. From this, the investor of the club, the Duke, finds out and gives Satine an ultimatum, continue to see Christian or shut down the nightclub. She makes the choice to give the writer up and star in the show one last time before leaving to marry the Duke. In the end Christian cannot take that the love of his life abandons him for fame and confronts her on opening night. Face to face with him Satine can no longer keep up the charade, she confesses that she was coerced by the evil Duke and falls into Christian's arms as the curtain drops. But, this is the point where a happy ending turns to tragedy. Satine, having consumption, dies there as he holds her tightly. In the end we relay back to the old broken apartment and the final thoughts of the man, heartbroken, alone and depressed from losing the only first love he has ever known.Obviously my short synopsis doesn't give the extraordinary value that this plot line deserves. The story flows very well and feels complete in the end. There are only a few questions or plot holes but they don't take away from the main story. Stunningly the feature is completed in only 127 minutes, which is typical for a musical and not long at all. Usually sitting in a movie for 2 hours can be daunting but with such a compelling fun story it doesn't feel like a task. No matter how many times I watch it, which is probably close to 50, I still get thrown for a loop with the ending. I love watching every scene and seeing the story unfold time after time. Something else I enjoy a lot from this film is the time period. Set in the middle of the Bohemian Revolution in 1899 Paris, France it takes you back to a time where art, freedom, love and beauty brought together a beggared society just trying to find their place in the world. It is very accurate towards that era and the production team worked very hard to bring it together. Although they filmed most of it in a studio the set they built represented what the real Moulin Rouge would have been like in 1899. To mimic the lifestyle they placed the time at night, which was when most of the indigent, lowlife traversed. They kept the inside of the Moulin Rouge bright and glowing to show that it was the main focus and a sort of "saving grace" for the vagabonds that ventured there. They bring to life its high point just before it burnt down in 1915.Not only is the setting fantastic, the costumes live up to the same standards. With a variety of time period garments such as can-can dancer dresses, men's coattail suits with top hats and elegant bustled dresses, it brings an attraction and as the French would say gena sa qua. Each costume is unique, having its own personality and I really love finding little details that I missed the previous time, there's always something new to see. You can tell that a lot of research and work went into creating these time pieces.Moulin Rouge brings together not only an original score but a compilation of songs from well-known artist. Musicians such as David Bowie, U2, The Beatles, and Elton John lend their poetic lyrics to invoke heartfelt emotion into the story. The majority of the songs are very meaningful and pull the audience into the moment. But not all are like that, the rest are catchy and exciting, such as "Lady Marmalade" and "Spectacular Spectacular", they make you want to get up and dance. My favorite would have to be "Roxanne". There is not one cast member that I don't believe fits the part they played. Besides being my favorite actor, Ewan McGregor, who plays Christian, was picked over top actors such as Leo DiCaprio and Heath Ledger. His counterpart, Nicole Kidman, who is coincidently my favorite female actress, won the Golden Globe for best actress for her work in this film.The most important thing I took from this movie is the metaphor that it engrafts. This story is about freedom, beauty, truth and most relevant?love. Love is the strongest motif and is represented through the whole film. The relationship between Christian and Satine symbolizes such a pure and true love that anyone should aspire to. It is also about overcoming all obstacles and living your dreams. The freedom to not only be with who you want but to not be trapped by the confines of what society says you should be.A movie with such symbolism is not well received by all. I believe that these few who look down upon it are not willing nor see the message that is lain before them. I hope that whoever sees this takes into their heart the deeper meaning. It's not just about how well the costumes are made or what actors play in it, it's about what someone takes away from it at the end and uses to influence their own life. Moulin Rouge is one of the greatest movies I have seen in my time and I feel honored to have discovered it and its true value to the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Moulin Rouge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch the movie The Moulin Rouge. I was first introduced to this movie by my wife and I have loved it ever since. It is a compelling comedic love story based in a historical setting with real historic references to war, art, diseases and artistic revolution upon a fictional story line along with fictional character. Through this critique we will be looking at some essentials of the plot, theme and characters as well as analysis, interpretations, evaluations and engagements.So starting with the plot, characters. The plot surrounds a penniless bohemian revolutionary writer and his love interest, a courtesan in a night club known as the Moulin Rouge who is aspiring to be an actress. The villain in this story is portrayed as a misogynist duke who falls in love with the courtesan and wants her for himself. The duke plays an essential role in the plot because he is not only the villain, but the main cause of the plot. The duke shows his essential characteristics in two ways. The first, he is the wedge between the protagonist and his love interest. The second goes into this because the wedge is because the duke is the only one who has offered to fund turning the Moulin Rouge from a night club to a theatre to that the courtesan can have her dream. The penniless writer is accidentally thrown into it under the impression that he would become the Moulin Rouges head writer for the bohemian revolution. However, because he falls in love with her, and very unfortunate miscommunications, the courtesan falls for the writer to the point where she cannot bring herself to betray the writer by satisfying the duke for his money.The theme is very easy to perceive. The theme is set in France in the year 1900. At this time, France was going through a revolution of arts and expression which was known as the Bohemian Revolution. The theme is mixed with some modern principles and songs but for the most part, keeps true to the history of the time period with dance, dress, art and even historical facts and political views at the time. The protagonist shows the purpose of this theme early in the movie as he remembers the conflict he had with his father concerning the difference in socially accepted principles. The main theme of this is of an early 1900s night club but does transform, adding to the theme of the Bohemian Revolution itself, into a more artistic and higher culture form of entertainment. Analyzing this film, there are many themes and characterizations that carry throughout the film. Starting with the theme that has been developed. The protagonist going from a household deemed by society as well developed and mannered, to a community that sees art and behavior more liberally, it shows the increasing liberal nature of humanity and self-expression. Characterizations are more along the lines of usual night clubs where most of the men and women involved in this story are more sex driven than those who are not, or in other words, the protagonist and his group are pretty much the only characters who are not driven by sexual desires in this movie. The interpretation the Moulin Rouge as a movie and a concept is trying to provide is that love is greater than anything anyone can offer. With the duke and the courtesan, as stated in the plot, the courtesan cannot sacrifice love just to win over money from a possessive duke.This movie, looking at it, is probably not within the confines of higher art, and would most likely be put in the wonderful, ever expanding box of popular culture. The movie in itself has enough comedy and sexual innuendos that it could possibly be considered boring or offensive to those of higher art or of previous generations. I consider this entertaining because of the comedy and music, such things are relatable to our current pop culture and other pieces of culture that us as an audience find entertaining, livable, or just plain hilarious. This is due to the overbearing underwhelming even childish special effects (e.g. mustached moon singing in background) and overdone makeup to help illustrate the colors and theme of the movie. Looking at reviews of this movie from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, it is a general 7-7.5 out of 10. However, most of the users of IMDb found it to be the best movie they have seen in a long time. As well according to IMDb, this film was the first musical nominated for best picture in 10 years, the last being Beauty and the Beast. Most of the reviews I have seen have matched my review and personal opinions of the movie based on the plot, characters, themes, and overall likeableness of the film. I would definitely give it a higher rating than the average given, probably at least an 8-8.5 but that is just me. Overall this is an exceptional film if you are not looking for a higher culture performance or form of entertainment that can come from this picture. The plot and characters are very easy to believe and the theme is very appropriate along with the music. Everything was put together very nicely and very professionally and I have to say, it was a great movie, would love to watch it again or recommend it to others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When art and cinema becomes one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An example of a film based on a book, which since its origin blends various art forms to tell the unhappy life and the ephemeral loves with dancers and models of Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, the painter of the late nineteenth century that a childhood accident had rendered deformed. The plot therefore should be loneliness and alcohol. But art is transfiguration, and that is where the masterpiece was born. So entertainment is, and entertainment at its best! Imagination and originality in a movie that breaks down the barriers of space and time: the life goes on the stage and merges with the art, the rock songs of the last thirty years bend to the whim of the characters giving voice to their passions. Music, simply used as a means of narrative, out of time and out of context, but for this reason even more powerful, is put at the service of art ... art, in turn, which, with the magnificence of the scenes and the extreme colors of the characters, surprises and strikes deep with his message of love, perhaps a bit Utopian compared to the gray cynicism of these days... Where "Shakespeare in Love" has failed miserably.</fullReview>

Oscar winner Jim Broadbent ("Iris" supporting actor) and others supply strong performances. The music and dancing is wonderful along with the stunning art direction and costumes. Nicole Kidman won an Oscar for another film in the same year but she is marvelous here. The film was shot in Australia far away from the real Montmartre section of Paris, France. The songs are more familiar and modern despite the setting and time. This film could be adapted for a stage musical. The weakness in this film is with the storyline. I felt there was more attention to the songs and dancing than the script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Rouge Theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes. Yes it is 2015 and I am reviewing Moulin Rouge, which I am aware came out in 2001. I have seen this movie well over 100 times and can sing, not well, every song from the movie. Now that is out of the way I will give an actual review of this movie. The theme of this review is "theme." Spoiler alert, it's not love. Or is it?It's the very early 1900's and Christian (Ewan McGregor), a young writer, moves to Paris. He meets Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo) and agrees to help him and other actors in this Bohemian movement to finish and present their show "Spectacular Spectacular" to Harold Zigler (Jim Broadbent), the owner of the infamous Moulin Rouge. Well to make ones dreams come true, a few white lies are invented and next thing you know Christian is not some poor writer but instead posing as the Duke of Monroth (which is later played by Richard Roxburgh) to convince the star courtesan, Satine (Nicole Kidman) to listen to their work who they hope will later take it to Harold.Long story short? Satine discovers Christian isn't who he says he is, they fall in love despite this fact. Unfortunately she is a prized "whore" and needs to actually be with the Duke to save the failing Moulin Rouge but is starting to feel guilty because she is in love. The Duke finds out about Christian and Satine and tries to rape her. Satine decides to give up her life at the Moulin Rouge for a life with a penniless writer but soon finds out she is dying and ends it with Christian to "save him" but instead it backfires. She dies. But before passing, they reconcile. Christian is heartbroken.Let's talk about theme. The fact that I have been watching this film for almost fifteen years I have discussed this film with many people during that time. A common topic is theme. Most of the time the answer is love. Is love actually a theme? No. Love plays a role in many themes especially in this film; moral implications, the truth of human nature, the struggle for human dignity, complexity of human relationships and coming of age. Lets pick one. I will put it out there the theme of Moulin Rouge is the coming of age/loss of innocence/growing awareness.Let's examine each one. ? Coming of Age. Christian left home for Paris to be a famous writer. He is new to a big city and we have to watch him develop into a man. ? Loss of Innocence. This applies both to Christian and Satine. Christian for obvious reasons (falling in love with a courtesan) and Satine because being a "whore" was the only life she has ever known. ? Growing Awareness. Christian and Satine realize life is not always what it presents itself to be. These two realized if in opposite ways. Christian ended up realizing it is sometimes worse than you want it to be and Satine realizing it can be better than you think it is. Of course that's before she dies. This film is shot well. The editing creates the needed chaos for emotion. The visual effects are appropriate to each scene. Costume and makeup design are on point. And don't even get me started on how amazing they did as singers? There is emotion created from this film. You may not like it, you may think it's cheesy but I respect that this film was shot different than anything else I have ever seen. I liked the organized chaos and I enjoyed watching Christian and Satine come of age, lose their innocence and grow more aware of who they are as individuals and as lovers.</fullReview>

It is easy to fault him for style over substance, or for taking classics like "Romeo and Juliet" and twisting them in ways we may not necessarily like. But I am not a detractor of his. Maybe "Strictly Ballroom" is not my cup of tea, but this film ("Moulin Rouge!") is pretty amazing.The colors, the clever re-interpretation of modern music. And some solid casting. Nicole Kidman has a handful of good roles and many others that are completely forgettable. (Probably most actors can say the same thing.) Luckily, this is one of her memorable ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge (2001): Dir: Baz Luhrmann / Cast: Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman, John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent, Richard Roxbergh: Ravishing look at early century Can Can clubs. It is a place that once was but no longer but to one lone poet the laughter and glitter remain. He receives opportunity to write a play for the club but falls in love with Nicole Kidman. She is the star but she suffers from an illness. When the Duke arrives he demands her hand and control of the play. Director Baz Luhrmann miraculously brings back the glamour of old musicals in a style similar to his Romeo and Juliet. He structures the film with club versions of modern pop songs. This is creative and festive but we know where it is heading and that will gnaw on our minds in the meantime. Tremendous job by Kidman who embodies the musical numbers with zest and energy becoming a glow within the dark business of corruption. Great musical entrance has her lowered on a swing and sways swiftly about to the applause of admirers. Ewan McGregor is superb as the love sick poet learns the consequences of falling in love. Unfortunately John Leguizamo and Jim Broadbent are featured in flat supporting roles amongst stereotypes, and the Duke is typically cardboard. The ending is depressing but aided by exquisite art direction that brings memories of a once flourishing genre. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

This is one of those movies that will live on for a long while and is a great example of mixing movie with music - a great musical. The pure enjoyment of listening to the two main characters playing off each other to the group songs for chorus purposes. The acting of course is excellent as well with a nice spin on the play within a play. The variety of music styles and songs is also a nice change of pace. The love against all obstacles is cliché but this movie puts a nice turn on that standard. The soundtrack has to be magical if it includes these talented folks. Enjoy and just a word - Magical.</fullReview>

I like how it looked a bit cartoony due to them moving and dancing in a faster speed. Since Ewan Mcgregor is one of my favorite actors, I enjoyed it even more.

I fell in love with Ewan McGregor's character and I got to understand and embrace the tragic story of Nicole Kidman's character throughout the movie. Baz Luhrmann successfully and skillfully combined comedy, drama and romance all into one great musical. The only reason I didn't give this movie more than eight out of ten stars is because it obviously displays very many sexual themes, so I do not recommend this movie to younger people.

		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge is one of the most divisive films of recent memory, thought visionary by some and stupid by others - and both by me. One thing is for sure though, Moulin Rouge is one of the maddest movies I have ever seen. The music, production design, and costumes make it ravishing if not ironically uneasy on the eyes. The direction could do with a bit of polishing, I would have liked much longer and more fluid takes for example, to take in the wonder that the film was visually for example.The film was pacey enough for me not to worry about the time while I was watching it and entertaining enough for me to smile and chuckle along.But overall, Moulin Rouge is definitely only one for those aficionados in everything Luhrmann.Lavish. Raunchy. Ridiculous. Oddball. Melodramatic.</fullReview>

Right off the start it managed to be incredibly entertaining but so overwhelming. After getting used to it though, I was completely riveted with it in its first act. I found it completely giddy in its cinematic execution. Very, very theatrical and messy, but so, so much fun. It was also hilarious, and Kidman's "Naughty!" line readings had me feeling like a ray of sunshine. But weirdly, after the first act, it keeps losing and losing steam. What exactly did it? Really, I can't be too sure with this type of film. It's not that I was overwhelmed like in the first few minutes. On the contrary, I found myself quite bored, and that's probably the least wanted intention Luhrmann had while making this. A big problem is that many of the songs just don't work. Some of them play out and I'm completely unaffected by them. The film managed to greatly recover in its final 20 minutes though, which are completely dazzling and exactly what I wanted from it.Overall, I'm still rather mixed on this. The inventive wit, humor, and just pure adrenaline running through this is completely unique to it and there's not many films I've seen that reach its energetic levels. A lot of it didn't work though, and a big reason is because too much of it completely desensitizes you. There's definitely a lot of ambition and creativity and fun, but it's also frequently quite terrible. When it is sometimes really terrible though, it's terrible in such a fun and entertaining way that you can't help but not look away (Like a Virgin!). But other times it's not exactly terrible, just extremely boring. And yet other times, you love it to such a high degree that you get caught up in all of it. So again, what exactly do I think of it as a whole? It's a mess, a sometimes beautiful, sometimes badly funny, sometimes just dull mess. That's basically it, and because of that I have to be completely in the middle on it. Once again, that's probably the least desired intention Luhrmann had in mind when making it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved It - Some Boring Moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, it's a great film. Some parts are absolutely spectacular. I think that Nicole Kidman gives a great performance as Satine, a courtesan at the infamous Moulin Rouge, and Ewan McGregor as Christian, the writer. My favourite part of the film is from the very beginning up to the elephant love medley. I adored the sequence at the Moulin Rouge where Satine sings "Diamonds are a girls best friend," (excellent singing throughout the movie, by the way, and all done by Nicole and Ewan.) I also loved the "pitch" where the Bohemians pitch their idea of a play to the wicked and evil Duke. Although many parts of the film are strong, I got bored with some of the musical performances and found myself skipping past them. Nevertheless, a GREAT film for anyone but the ending may come as as a shock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this one a year or two ago, I couldn't imagine how I existed without knowing about this musical masterpiece. It's a spectacular film, a beautiful love story told by a poverty-stricken English poet, and tons of songs by distinguishing singers and bands of 20th century (from Marilyn Monroe and the Beatles to Elton John and Madonna). The songs performed by the cast are music to the ears, and choreography is magnificent. There's only one amazing original song ('Come What May') in the film. Probably, the only thing that I didn't like about this movie is over-drama. Indeed, too much drama, too many tears shed by Christian, by Satine, even by Toulouse. Anyways, it's one of my top favorites and is therefore highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spectacular Spectacular Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay this movie has been on my personal top 10 list of my favorite movies of all time ever since I first saw it and fell in love with it when I was 11. I have always been a fan of musicals and to me this movie is the greatest musical of the 20 century. The music and dance numbers are beyond amazing!! I am so glad that they actually used the actors actual singing voices instead of having the lipsync to other people sing. Nicole Kidman was amazing as "Satine" the gorgeous star courtesan of "The Moulin Rouge". Nicole can sing very well, and she shows that off in this movie. Ewan McGregor did a great job as "Christian" the writer who falls in love with "Satine". Ewan also has an amazing voice as well. Jim Broadbent perfect for the role of Zidler!! He fits this role so well. Richard Roxburgh did a pretty good job playing the obsessed Duke. John Leguizamo was I think the perfect choice for Toulouse-Lautrec, I cannot think of anyone else playing Toulouse in this movie, it just wouldn't be the same. Jacek Koman is HILARIOUS as the "Unconcious Argentinian". I love the fact that Kylie Minogue had a cameo appearance in the movie as "The Green Fairy". Sorry for me going on and on about the actors I just believe this was one of the greatest casts ever assembled for a movie. Baz Luhrman did an amazing job with this movie and he has such a brilliant mind that I totally admire him. He is a bad-@ss director.I love this whole movie and all of the songs and dance sequences so it's hard for me to pick a favorite but I think my favorite of the whole movie was "Hindi Sad Diamonds". I love, love, love that sequence. I love the song and the choreography to the music was AMAZING!! Another one of my favorites is "El Tango De Roxanne". Jacek Koman can sing well. I love the raspy sound of his voice.I also LOVE the costumes and makeup in this film. They did a wonderful job in keeping the clothing to the time period and they made the clothes look fantastic at the same time s well.This is an AMAZING movie. This is a great, tragic love story about two people falling in love yet they have to keep their love a secret from others. This is one of the best movies ever in my opinion. If you haven't watched it, WATCH IT!! If you love musicals and love stories, I am 100% guaranteed you'll love this movie like I do. You'll find yourself falling in love with the characters, the songs, the dances, and the story.Freedom, Beauty, Truth, and Love!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that I have been hearing nothing but such great things about the famous movie Moulin Rouge so naturally I just had to check it out. But after watching it I am really starting to wonder if I saw the same movie.The film is about Christian played by Ewan MacGreggor who goes to a Broadway theater Known as Moulin Rouge. The Star Singer Satine played by Nicole Kidman who is the star the keeps everybody coming back. The two find themselves in madly in love(Trust me I should know because they say it every 5 seconds) and work together to save the theater from being demolished.This is a very poorly shot film. Whoever edited this must have been hopped up on Starbucks and Tic-Tacs because every shot lasts about 2-5 seconds. The Characters are very odd and very strange for a film set in 1899. Speaking of why is it that in a film that is set in 1899 do we have Christina Agulera songs? But All of the stuff done with Ewan MacGreggor and Nicole Kidman are very well done and are two wonderful singer. But that is not enough for me to like this film like everyone else.Rated PG-13 For Sexual Content.2hrs 8min/128min.**/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even now, more than 10 years after this film was released it still captivates me. Ewan and Nicole both just shine in this film. I remember seeing this movie 9 times in the theaters, and have watched it at least twice that many times at home. It's wonderful escapist cinema. The love story, tension, music/score, characters, cinematography, humor, and more all make it for one of my all-time favorite films.I recently moved and put this on to test my home theater system. Once I started it, I couldn't stop it. It's been several years since I'd seen it from beginning to end, and I still think it holds up. Baz Luhrmann makes too few movies, if you ask me. If you've not seen this movie, give it a shot. Trust me, once you get past the first ten minutes (they're confusing and a bit of an odd start to a movie) you're stuck.</fullReview>

Baz Luhrmann's movie with it's great colors, visuals bring you to a dream world from where you don't want to escape.Another great achievement of the movie is the superb singing's of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, they perform like some professional singers and these love songs melt them together.The lyrics of the songs that are used in the movie make a big impact ,making it a great singing about love. "Come What May" is newly written for the stage and the only original song used in the movie, Elton John's "Your Song" is although greatly matching.Moulin Rouge is dedicated to Baz Luhrmann's father, Leonard Luhrmann, who died before filming. Rest in peace he got a superb movie for remembering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Rouge (2001) - The Greatest Thing You Will Ever Learn is Just to Love, and Be Loved in Return!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann's imaginative portrait of beauty, freedom, truth, and love, is brought to life in the powerful, and exhilarating "Moulin Rouge". The story is like a jukebox containing many incredible songs from our time, and transports it into a world where love is more powerful than anything else in the whole wide world. So, let me just say this, and I'm not afraid to admit it. "Moulin Rouge" is one of the most heartbreaking movies I have ever seen, and it almost made me cry my guts out. From the powerful music, the neat cinematography and editing, to the elegant sets and costumes, "Moulin Rouge" is a marvelous musical containing everything. The casting ensemble was also brilliant, with a list containing Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman, John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent, and Richard Roxburgh. Each member of the casting ensemble was powerfully brilliant, and one amazing ensemble I have ever seen on film. Also, the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor is electrifying, and the couple sizzles on the screen, making it one of the most precious movie couples I have seen in a long time, and trust me, I have been through that before. Finally, the part I love the most, was the glorious music. The music was beautifully imagined, and either some music was made for the movie, or inspired by other famous artists, the soundtrack was still amazing, and it's an amazing wonder to hear. And the finale blends with a perfect notch of drama and heartbreak, and it's one of the most saddest endings since "West Side Story". "Moulin Rouge" is a perfect movie-musical containing heartbreaking drama, beautiful songs, and a perfect imagination from director Baz Luhrmann. It's all that's necessary to make one of the best musicals ever put to film. "Moulin Rouge", in my review, "a powerful musical, with a beautiful soundtrack".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read several reviews on here slating the movie and I disagree with the lot of them.. this is an excellent piece of film which I thought was very innovative when it was released. I LOVE Ewan and Nicole as leads and think they play the characters very well, people are slagging off Ewan's voice when really, he gives it his all and it sends shivers down my spine, similar to when I am at the theatre (erm.. or watching glee:o) I love the harmonising and how the songs have been all combined to provide large chunks of the script, the first time I watched it I thought this was a delightful use of some of the songs (and in fact when I hear some of the originals now days I automatically hear the counter tune from Moulin Rouge in my head) this tells me the film made an impact on me. I think a lot of people need to give this movie a chance, the first 20mins are so are a whirlwind of colour and its a bit confusing but definitely on a second viewing its excellence should show through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the movie is a contrived mix of late nineteenth century events with modern music. Yes, it's mostly a lot of singing and dancing and then the heroine dies as she was going to all along, having had consumption (tuberclosis). Yes, it's very flashy and unrealistic. Yet it still manages to work.How? Probably because everyone manages to play everything straight. Like Monty Python, it's the straightforward performances that manage to carry the material. The actors manage to meld everything seamlessly, which in other hands might have led to disaster. The movie was an artistic risk, but it paid off.</fullReview>

The two-dimensional Parisian backdrop is extra cool, the elephant and windmill especially... and the main character's typewriter means of story telling felt just right.What a complex and heart breaking love story, a struggle between survival and indulgence, selfishness and community (family).

		<shortDescription>A classic love story flourishing beneath an odd and flamboyant spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was an ultimate and absolute antonym for "Moulin Rouge!" it would be the adjective "shy." Hundreds of gorgeous costumes, lavish studio sets, a digitally reproduced city of Paris and an abrupt and cartoonish comedic style make this movie musical a one-of-a-kind spectacle.From the very first musical mash-up number in the Moulin Rouge club that consists of around five songs, two of which are Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend," you get a sense that "Moulin Rouge!" wants desperately to be different and ultimately unforgettable. The initial gut reaction to the film's camp and genre- butchering is to dismiss it as forced and unnatural, but once the recycled albeit powerful love story takes over, the derring-do of Baz Luhrmann's visually striking show becomes much more easily appreciated.Despite a mix of songs that defies the historical context, "Moulin Rouge!" takes place in turn-of-the-century Paris in the "underground," inspired by the paintings of Toulouse- Lautrec of the burlesque dancers, courtesans and Absinthe-drinkers. Christian (McGregor) is a hopeless romantic poet whose talent earns him a shot to convince the most famous dancer/performer/courtesan, Satine (Kidman), and her manager/pimp, Harold Zidler (Broadbent) at the city's most famous club, the Moulin Rouge, to let him create the show that will turn Satine into a star. At the same time, a wealthy Duke (Roxburgh) is funding the show and one of his conditions is for Satine to be his."Moulin Rouge!" is also not shy about love or letting you know its themes are love and everything to do with love and that it's all that matters in life. If not for Kidman's wonderful performance as a morally conflicted woman dealing with masculine pressures and discovering love is indeed possible, one could make the case that the focal relationship between her and Christian around which the rest of the film blooms might never have even begun to ripen. Christian, after all, is a one-dimensional character seeing as he's motivated only by Satine and true love -- he has no other desires. So as Satine falls for him and his incredible ability to steal the material of famous songwriters decades after his lifetime and perform it with a soaring tenor, something must ground the film, and her very real issues, which are inspired by a combination of famous story lines including "La Boheme" and "La Traviata," do the trick.Then there's Luhrmann's (1996's "Romeo + Juliet") influences on the film. As it progresses, we begin to love his work here more and more. As the plot thickens and turns for the dramatic (and convincingly so despite so much early antics), his lightning-fast editing choices and lighting become even more effective and the musical numbers being fashioned out of a wide array of songs (like Sting's "Roxanne" mixed with original tango music) become all the more impressive.Sweeping zoom-ins of a city done all by computer and music numbers that are shot and choreographed in an all too showtune-y manner go from questionable choices to beautiful ones as Luhrmann's twist on a classic love story archetypes matures before our eyes and the true spirit of his film becomes clearer. There are still some goofy elements that don't fit, but the spontaneity of song and its often times non-traditional use is one of the biggest things to make sense and fit Luhrmann's vision with time.Despite only one original song in "Come What May," (which should have been allowed to contend for an Oscar) it's more the placement of the songs, the way they follow traditional musical theater rules for song placement -- either setting the mood and foreshadowing the story or expounding on the characters' inner feelings at appropriate times -- makes them so effective. Similar can be said of "Moulin Rouge!" on the whole: though there's an inherent abruptness, randomness and even a faux quality to much of the film, it keeps the traditional love story at its core and everything else is merely growing bountifully from it. There's a reason the same kinds of love stories get recycled in the theater and movies and simply get dressed up a different way and it's because those stories work; they appeal to something human. So as flamboyant and absurd as this movie gets, it never goes wrong because it sticks to its universal storytelling ideas. ~Steven C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admittedly; I approached this film reluctantly. "Historic/Romantic musical describing the short yet passionate fling of a writer and a cancan dancer, that stars a Scottish and Australian duo as the leads in a very French film that uses well known songs to create an artistic thriller?"- I thought.But don't miss out on this fantastic viewing experience. It hits every single note and it is just amazing.First it introduces you to the simple life of bohemian Christian and then it throws you headfirst into the promiscuous antics that take place in the Moulin Rouge, the courtier (Satines) place of work and residence. Then it reels you into a tale of epic love when these two worlds meet, through the young and talented pair (Christian and Satine). All is blissful until complications ignite, which are initially hilarious but ultimately heartbreaking.This film is a roller-coaster of genres; you'll be crying so heavily you won't believe that you were rolling around in hysterics ,mere scenes ago. Artistic, tragic, hilarious, musical and historical; This film is pleasing on so many levels that just watching it wont be enough, you'll have to Google it and download all the songs to your iPod. Forget R&amp;B, Come What May and the Elephant Love Medley will be dominating your playlist.UNBEATABLE FLAWLESSNESS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann and Nicole Kidman. In Moulin Rouge!, they are both at their peak. Unfortunately lately, they've been in a slump. Their last film was Australia, a stunning failure. A western mashed sloppily into a war epic trying to chronicle the history of the country/continent. Kidman was humiliated by her performance; she knew how far she had fallen. She fled her native country, Australia, during the premier. She couldn't take the criticism. It was very disappointing. If you're wondering who Baz Luhrmann is, he is the director of Strictly Ballroom, Romeo+Juliet, and the aforementioned movies, plus the very bizarre tribute to musicals at the last Oscars. Oh, and that weird song "Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)" that was kinda popular once.But that really is neither here nor there, because this is Moulin Rouge!, made seven years before Australia and is seven times better. There have been at least five movies titled "Moulin Rouge," though this one is distinct as it's the only one that includes an exclamation mark in the title. And features the music of Elton John, Madonna, and every love song ever written, set mostly to house music.Now let's, again, back up. Moulin Rouge! is about a boy, Christian (Ewan McGregor), from a small town who has gone to Paris to be a Bohemian writer. So as he sits, lost, in his apartment, and Argentinean falls through his roof. He's then commandeered into acting, then writing a play ("Spectacular Spectacular") for Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo), who is oddly changed from a painter to an actor. But anyway. Then he's sent to win the most beautiful courtesan in Paris, Satine (Nicole Kidman), from the Moulin Rouge (a dance club in this version), so she will act in their play, despite the change in writers. This happens in a matter of minutes, also allowing for the scene where the troupe trips on absinthe.It's a bizarre musical about freedom, beauty, truth, and most of all, love. And it's stunning. It takes you by surprise. You really do have to pay attention the entire time; it's very easy to miss something important in the frantic, kinetic, colorful mess on screen. I wonder how Baz Luhrmann convinced the other producers to jump onto this movie. "No really, it'll be amazing. Look, we'll start with him in his apartment singing 'Nature Boy' by Nat King Cole, then this guy'll fall through his roof and he'll sing 'The Sound of Music' and they'll get on absinthe. No, and then there'll be this medley type number mixing up Nirvana and Madonna... and, oh my god you guys, it's gonna be great." "Umm... Okay..."And yet, everything really does work. All the elements fall together in a crazy chaotic way. It's a tragi-comedy, and there's a musical-within- a-musical. The movie starts loud, and crescendos like a symphony. It's the reason people expected so much from Australia, how could the Kidman- Luhrmann partnership failed after such a masterpiece? It's a theater piece, really. But it works. It works. That's all I can do to assure you. It's a top class movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly different, and I loved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was hard to know what to expect with "Moulin Rouge!" and truthfully, nothing could have been expected. It's a totally unique film in just about every aspect. The film is a musical that maintain's the typical musical feel that goes along with such a love story as this, but what made it different was the fact that none of the musical was original. All of the songs are fairly contemporary, including such tunes as "All You Need is Love," "I Will Always Love You," and my favorite from this film, "Come What May." I would never have thought such a thing would work, but believe me it does. I couldn't help smiling throughout just about every musical number in the film, and the spontaneous singing or songs we all know but could never have predicted in such a film as thing made it even more delightful. Plot-wise, the story is similar to such things as "Shakespeare in Love" (in which the play being written in the film is being inspired by the main characters' secret romance) and "West Side Story" (in which the main characters cannot be together due to forbidden love and such). However, it was the way this film was made that made it feel so original, with the quick and unexpected scenes such as characters suddenly falling in through the roof and the quick pace at which the film goes by. The music made the film for me, and Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman had perfect chemistry. I admit that it might be bizarre at times, which may turn some people off, and it is still a tragic story, but I loved it anyway. Wow, it's hard to know what else to say about this film, expect that it became an instant favorite and is a must-see for movie lovers. It was robbed of Best Picture. We don't see many films this unique, or this good, anymore.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favourite Australian movie, for numerous reasons. The beautiful set, costumes and amazing cinematography and direction made by Baz Lurahamn and it is well acted. Most movies have a great start but slags onwards with a lazy finale. This is different: and proves that all you need is love. From the fantastic songs 'Roxanne' and many more, this movie is amazing in it's own way. It's original and I'm happy to call myself Australian after watching this. The dances are very well done and I cried when Satine died. The evil duke is traditional as the villain, and this film defines what love is. It's got an amazing soundtrack as well and anyone can enjoy it. Nicole Kidman is perfect as Satine, and Ewan McGregor makes Christian a better partner than Jack ever was to Rose. I preferred it over Titanic, because this movie was very impressive in a much shorter budget. This is must- see cinema, with great characters and emotional factors drawn into it to create a masterpiece</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge portrays a complicated, passionate and powerful love story, that is also incredibly moving. I am 17, and I thought the film was near-perfect, I mean I loved the overall look of the film with its gorgeous costumes, dazzling choreography and sumptuous cinematography. The script was very poetic, especially when Christian is comparing Satine, the beautiful courtesan to a "sparkling diamond", and when Toulouse exclaims "I hope the piano is tuned". The songs are wonderful, particularly "Come What May" and "The Show Must Go On", and everybody in the cast does their own singing, and I honestly didn't know Ewen MacGregor could sing, he has an amazing voice. I have heard too many complaints saying there are too many songs, but do bear in mind it is a musical, and to me, being an aspiring singer, music is like poetry, and very often is the best way to describe your mood. I thought the performances were brilliant. Ewen MacGregor is very earnest and likable as always as Christian, and Nicole Kidman is both fabulously sexy and wonderfully tragic as the consumptive Satine, and the character's death scene was quite heart-rending, and was very reminiscent of the Greta Garbo movie Camille(which I will admit I like more). I also liked the performances of Jim Broadbent as the sympathetic Ziegler and Richard Roxburgh as the wily duke. However there were one or two aspects that were extremely silly, like the hilarious Can Can scene as well as the duet between Ziegler and the Duke, and compared to Jose Ferrer's more poignant portrayal as Toulouse in the 1952 version, John Leguizamo as the character mayn't be to everyone's taste. Overall, a beautiful extravagant film with a 9/10. Bethany Cox</fullReview>

You know how some people say that they laughed, they cried at the end of a great movie? I did all of these and more. I was breathless during most of the musical numbers. The first time that Christian and Satine were in Elephant Room, I laughed so hard I'm pretty sure i started to cry. Once Satine died and Christian began to cry, tears began to build up and I couldn't help but crying right along with them. This movie was beautiful and it is one that I will cherish for the rest of my life.</fullReview>

I absolutely loved it from the first time I saw it. Some people hate the use of modern songs being used in a movie that is set in the 1890's. Others think it's just cheesy and overacted. Yes, there are some cheesy moments but they're strangely cute to watch. The movie is so beautiful. The costumes are so colorful and the sets are elaborate and you kind of want to be there to experience all of it. I love watching this movie every chance I get. It never gets old to me. I can see why some people might not like this movie but those who give it a chance may find that they love it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is a great musical. It pushes the boundary of musicals in the way that many good recent movies have done: by mixing and mashing existing forms. Compared to say, The Matrix, Moulin Rouge has much more crazy mixing, but less finessing (not to say that the Matrix couldn't use more finessing). I particularly indulged in the thought that Moulin Rouge merges Disney with pornography. I doubt this sat well with the "Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever" crowd.I believe that musicals are best enjoyed as musicals. As a rule, the construct will bare its seams because of the fact that people simply don't break out simultaneous into song. For most traditional film-lovers, this will be a huge hurdle as the expectations of seamless film-making originates with the likes of Kubrick and Coppola and pop culture simply doesn't have the class to out do it.And while we're talking about class, the dirty down inside theory is that musicals, as per Bollywood, as per the main role of music in almost any country, is to serve as an aphrodisiac for the masses. Conversely, a high-brow is someone who proclaims to have found something more interesting than sex. The two sides are not likely to ever agree very much and for a class targeted piece like Moulin Rouge, disagreements on its quality are as eternal as the class differences that draw the lines.Even the most clever of musicals- "Cabaret" (1972) has its kinks. And the glorious musicals of old like "Footlight Parade" (1933) consistently have flimsy story lines that serve as loose filler between the fantastic musical vignettes.I got my kicks from the movie through the numerous times it cleverly breaks the fourth wall. Also I couldn't help but muse at the supposition where I could write/sing like the lead character. Having many musicians as friends and once being a fledgling musician myself, I know it's an effective vehicle of seduction.Ah, but how very low-brow of me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>La Boheme meets Cabaret. I don't much like this film - it's too gooey and the songs are awful, arch and weakly sung. However I see why it has such a following - even more than Romeo and Juliet this is a Baz Luhrman film (irrespective of the cast), with an alchemic mixture of design, editing and stylish sex-appeal that makes the viewer feel more involved than they really are.There's nothing to complain about from the point of view of performances either. McGregor and Kidman clearly have a serious investment in Luhrman-faith. You can just see the crinkles of misgivings as they throw themselves into another auteurial routine. Jim Broadbent's Zidler is a case in point of the old school simply doing their thing without a career to trust to fate (i.e. he's been there already) and John Leguizamo's Toulouse-Lautrec is hilarious. Fun but fickle. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'We are creatures of the underworld, we can not afford to love. The show must go on.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MOULIN ROUGE! is visually spectacular, and the movie floats away on a childishly whimsical tune with Paris as a backdrop, and is truly an adventurous ride. Director Baz Luhrmann uses the MTV-technique of his Romeo+Juliet with even more extravagance and fun, and like fireworks the scenes are glazing with pop-music references (the 'Like a Prayer' turn is especially amusing), fairy-tale love and temptations.And 2 hours with THIS kind of dancing, singing and emotions is almost a gay-ish blast, with its great choreography and cinematography - and in the beautiful Paris you'll be drawn down to Moulin Rouge's atmosphere were sparks fly with decadence and lust. Ewan McGregor is the angel-innocence in a world of sin (according to his father), and he's a hero wherever he sets his foot, but slips into sorrow and depression over his love's (Nicole Kidman) death. A death birthed by Moulin Rouge's tireless demands, a life where she's worth whatever a customer would pay for her.The first act is a blast of humorous editing, colorful cinematography and surely a crazy Jim Broadbent, but the slow-paced scenes of Christian (McGregor) and Satine (Kidman), in the second and third act, clearly states a pure love, and the carefully directed scenes of Kidman alone gives a feeling that the tragedy is within reach. It's a surprisingly emotionally powerful movie, and the earlier, sprouting tunes turns into something darker, as Sting's 'Roxanne' becomes McGregor's earnest, jealous and cry-out for Satine to leave her Moulin-Rouge-life behind, and the roller-coaster introduction simply en-powers its drama as Jim Broadbent tells her Satine; "We are creatures of the underworld, we can not afford to love. The Show Must Go On.", and suddenly this tragic fairy-tale has got a meaning and message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched Moulin Rouge a few times it has begun to grow on me in a good way, I have no idea why but I have a thing for musicals at the moment staring actors who don't usually sing, for example Moulin Rouge (Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman) and Mamma Mia (Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth) I think it may be because its funny listening to them sing when they are not natural musicians or I could like it because its something different to what you hear in the charts today which is probably the reason why I have grown attached to these films. One thing I didn't mention at the start was that the singing and acting from the two main roles of Nicole and Ewan went together perfectly, especially in the "Elephant Medley" scene their voices merged together beautifully with the addition of some great 20th century classics like "your song" by Elton John and "I will always love you" by Whitney Houston. They turned these classics into great new songs by doing mixing them together along with other great songs from the 20th century. This film is a superb example of musical film in the form of a tragic love story where the penniless Writer "Christian" (McGregor) is deprived of his (burlesque dancer) secret lover "Satine" (Kidman) right at the end of the film just when they thought they were about to live happily ever after. It is enough to bring a tear to the eyes of some however I did not. Overall I think Baz Luhrmann has exceeded himself as a director with this film and I believe it will go on to be a musical classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I didn't know what to expect. It shocked me in the most positive way possible. The screenplay is excellent, so is the directing. The cast couldn't been better. I think that you really feel Ewan in this one. Nicole is brilliant as Satin, she really captures her 'spirit'. Also, I have to comment on the soundtrack. Absolutely one of the best ever heard. Especially if you're in a difficult relationship yourself and if you're experiencing strong emotion towards someone you're not supposed to , it will surely bring a tear in your eye. The part: ''you're free to leave me, but just don't deceive me and please, believe me when I say I love you'' does the trick for me. The movie really touched me in two parts. The 'Roxanne' one, of course and the 'The show must go on'. I cry every time I see them. The death wasn't as tragic to me...because I don't see it that badly as the fact that their love was destroyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great and unique artistic vision, but they completely blew the execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>moulin rouge! seems to be universally beloved, so i saw it with high expectations, but also with an open mind. i really wanted to like this movie. however, i was rather disappointed.i think i can see what they are trying to do here: the cinematic equivalent of a great pop song. simple in its content, glamorous in its presentation and honest in its emotion. its a great and daring artistic vision and certainly unlike anything I've seen so far. so it really pains me that they completely blew the execution.the biggest (but far from only) mistake is casting Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor as the leads. neither of them can sing, which is fatal in a love story in which the lovers express their feelings by bursting into song. furthermore, they lack chemistry and utterly fail to convince in their roles. Kidman spends the first half of the movie squeaking hysterically and the second half being the passive observer of her own fate; McGregor is styled as if he was a member of the Backstreet Boys.but there are so many other things that bothered me. the comedy parts are so over the top that they are more annoying than funny. the voice-over narration is just lazy. and i know in a movie like this the story is not really important, but still, it wouldn't have hurt to have a slightly less idiotic plot.the selection of songs is a mixed bag: Patti Labelles "lady marmalade" and the polices "Roxanne" are a given, and there are flashes of brilliance (eg. Nirvanas "smells like teen spirit", Madonnas "material girl"). but "the sound of music" and "rhythm of the night"? "up where we belong"? really? and for a film that relies so heavily on its production design, Moulin Rouge! is remarkably tasteless, even for a film that embraces kitsch. (check out Sofia Coppolas "Marie Antoinette", François Ozons "8 Femmes" or Todd Haynes' "velvet goldmine" to see how these things should be done.)if seen with lesser expectations, Moulin Rouge! is still an enjoyable rush with an admirable artistic vision buried somewhere underneath its many flaws. its certainly courageous and unique, and it will probably be even more hilarious to see it in ten or twenty years. but really, i don't understand why it was so successful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but an overall disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Moulin Rouge for the first time last night, and I had high hopes for it. I knew it was a musical, and I'd heard raving reviews from friends, telling me that this movie was something I NEEDED to see.Well, I have to say, I don't regret watching it, but I wouldn't say it's something that anyone really needs to see.First, I'll just mention things I DID like: The visual effects, the overall setting, was beautiful. Everything about those were beautiful, and if effects and set design interests you, DEFINITELY see this film, because you won't be disappointed. I also thought that, on another note, the acting was good, too. There weren't any horrible actors, but no one really shined. I'd say, if anyone, Ewan McGregor did great. On that same subject, the singing was fantastic all around. I was VERY impressed.However, the film just fell apart other than that. First off, the whole concept somewhat eludes me. What genre is it, exactly? For a while it seems to be almost a comedy and then, periodically, most notably the ending, was a complete tragedy. Was this intended to play with our emotions? If so, they failed in that aspect, as I was just confused.Another thing that has been debated over and over is the song usage. I personally would have preferred the music to be what it was at the real Moulin Rouge at that time period in France. The set, and the effects engross you in that time, but the music just brings you right back. I really didn't like the use of modern music at all.One thing I didn't really see, which would have made it much better, was a chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, or even a better... passion between the two of them. When I get really into a certain couple, or just really like one, they don't just have a good story, there must be a level of chemistry. And I just didn't sense it between Satine and Christian. They certainly had a lot of romantic scenes, but I've felt a LOT more chemistry between characters that rarely, if ever, get romantic scenes together (Ex: Mulder and Scully from The X-Files). I apparently missed the passion between these two.All in all, Moulin Rouge's was interesting, and certainly entertaining, but I just didn't think it was as great as some of the reviews make it out to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge! The only movie I can ever remember seeing with an exclamation point in the title! But that's about the only originality you'll find in this film.Does Moulin Rouge have great musical numbers? Of course! But are they original? Moulin Rouge samples, "The Sound of Music", "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend," "Smells Like Teen Spirit", "Lady Marmelade", "I Will Always Love You" and "Like a Virgin". The list goes on and on. It's more like a Puff Daddy Remix Album than an original motion picture soundtrack.How about the plot? A struggling writer competes with a wealthy man for the love of a beautiful girl. Nothing too original there.So surely it must be the dialog. Yet thinking back, the only phrase that's still ringing in my ears is "The show must go on!" A great phrase, but nothing Moulin Rouge can claim to have coined.Is Moulin Rouge a bad movie? Not at all. The chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor is excellent, especially when they're singing duets. And while a little neurotic at times, the movie never lags or leaves the viewer bored. Despite all my complaints, the movie was over before I knew it. So while I didn't like it, I can easily see how someone else might. My biggest suggestion here is to RENT IT before you buy it. Because, while it's not a bad movie, it's also not as good as everyone says.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You don't have to like musical's to bear this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As watching this film was part of my university film course, it became compulsive viewing even though I would normally steer MILES clear of ANY film even mentioned within a breath of the musicals genre. I wasn't expecting anything fantastic and went in with the lowest of lowest expectations, I think this film did pretty well considering that factor. The visuals are pretty stunning. The amount of colour and energy you are drowned in is quite spectacular although this is partly down to Baz Luhrmann's way of doing films, namely with the fast edits he uses. The settings and clothes used were pretty good and even more so when viewing it on 'the big screen' as I saw it in a proper viewing theatre - a feeling I'm told isn't as much present when viewed on the small screen. Although the music itself feels very out of place with characters breaking into chorus' of 'Your Song' and 'Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend' on the verge of the 20th century, it doesn't distract TOO much from the rest of the film, in fact if anything it makes it a tiny bit stronger. One thing that is quite perplexing about the film is the fact that the main character or, in actual fact actor, can sing and sing very well. The songs (all be them modern when compared to the set era) are sung with such grace and passion, it makes you just sit and stare and the activity on screen and in a REALLY odd way, you actually become more aware of the lyrics and how beautiful the song can actually be.In terms of narrative, there's nothing too spectacular. It's the classic love triangle and very reminiscent to that of the situation faced in another musical: 'The Phantom of the Opera (2004)'. The story gets rather stuck. It tries to go up a gear now and again with the Heroine's 'black out' problems and 'the Duke' character getting involved with the Moulin Rouge set up in a certain way but everything seems too planned and too forced for it to flow in a seamless way and for it to be of a level of entertainment that I'd usually enjoy. Still, with plenty of colour and energy and strong acting performances, both in the singing and general acting department this is a pretty enjoyable film that you'll like if you're into your romantic, period dramas with a musical flavour. Even if you're not, you'll enjoy it for its energy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I probably don't have to tell you what the Moulin Rouge really is and where it can be found. It's one of the most famous cabarets in the world and even today it still breaths an atmosphere of decadence, eroticism and freedom. This of course had to be the subject of a movie sooner or later and in 2001 it finally happened. "Moulin Rouge!" saw its first (stage) light and caused a little shock wave in the world of cinema.At the turn of the 19th and 20th century a young English poet named Christian, comes to Paris to pursue an unpaid, but free career as a Bohemian writer. Soon he meets a group that asks him to write a musical for them, which they will perform in the Moulin Rouge, the most famous underworld night club in Paris. When he goes for the very first time to that famous night club, he immediately falls in love with the beautiful courtesan Satine. Satine thinks he's 'The Duke', the man she has to please, because her boss expects a lot of money for him so he can build a new and proper theater. The Duke seems to be willing to give him that money, but he has one request: he wants exclusive access to the favors of Satine, who doesn't have any problem with that, because she finally wants to become a proper actress in a proper theater. And normally that request shouldn't pose any problem, but in the meantime Satine has done something no courtesan should ever do: she has fallen in love with Christian. This is the beginning of a dramatic love story that sooner or later will end in a tragedy...I loved the fact that this movie wanted to give an idea of how the Moulin Rouge looked like in the early nineteen hundreds. I'm very interested in that time period and I was really looking forward to it. And exactly that was MY biggest mistake, because this movie hasn't got much to do with the history of the Moulin Rouge or the people who worked there. This movie isn't much more but an extremely fast paced, almost video clip like, vehicle for popular pop songs from the last fifty years that have been slightly renewed. Sure it all has a modern and slick feeling, but it also gave me the impression of a hollow shell. It almost felt like this was made for all those Americans who don't know anything about Europe, but who love flashy shows and fast consumption and who find everything great and lovely, as long as they don't have to think too much ... This movie never really gives you a moment to catch a breath, to come back to your senses. It's a constant whirlpool of emotions, music and spectacular events. I know many people love that (if you check the percentage of people that gave this movie a 10, you'll get an idea), but for me personally it didn't really work. I might even say that it sometimes started to work on my nerves. Still, not everything about the movie was bad. The chemistry between Satine and Christian felt real thanks to the nice performances of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. I never thought those two would ever from a couple in a movie, but I must say that it really worked. So definitely no complaints about that. As a conclusion I want to add that it is a good thing that the genre of the musical isn't dead yet. It has always had a spot in the history of cinematography and it should have one in the future as well. But I have my doubts about the fact if this is the best way to go. Every day we are flooded by millions of video clips on TV stations like MTV, do we really need that in a movie as well??? Personally I don't think so and that's why I give this movie a 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to make of this film at first, the opening scenes didn't really grab my attention, then there were a couple of scenes in the Moulin rouge theatre, these were great, I did wonder at one point after several minutes of demented clown like things when teen spirit started to play what I was watching. The film is bit surreal, with a fairy tale type vibe running through it. I liked the scene in the elephant when Satine is trying to hide Christian, that made me laugh.I have seen Romeo and Juliet and it is clear that these two films are both by Luhrmann, they have the same feel to them.This film was quiet different from what I expected, but was still good. The acting was good, there could maybe have been a bit less singing, but then it is a musical. Overalll this is an enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gosh, I can't believe some of the comments I've read about 'Moulin Rouge'. Guys, if you like this, you'll love all Hindi movies! This is like a Hindi movie dubbed in English! The saving grace of this whirling musical is the cinematography and 2 of the songs, 'Spectacular, Spectacular' and 'Roxanne'. Otherwise, the movie is just tedious...with the characters breaking into a song at the drop of a hat, prolonging the ordeal even more, so much so that the audience was impatient for Satine to actually die in Christian's arms...The plot was one of the stalest and its unfolding too was ridden with clichés...It's so ironical when such movies become hits, become the 'piece de resistance' at a Film Festival like Cannes and are nominated for the Academy Awards. Because except for the aforementioned cinematography, there's nothing in this movie that's not done before all over the world, especially in India, in Hindi movies; it's just done with more razzmatazz over here. Why am I insisting on seeing parallels between this movie and Hindi movies? Well, because, Hindi movies still have songs as an integral part of their makeup. And albeit, the quality of all Hindi movies may not be that great, or they may not be blessed with Luhrmann's technical wizardry, they are all that 'Moulin Rouge' claims and more. 'MR' even has a Hindi song and that unfortunate Sitar player story...I wished the movie had more to offer than just good camera effects. It suffers from defects that plague even Hindi movies, namely a stale plot and tedious unraveling of it. Given that, Hollywood's condescension for Bollywood(read Hindi movies) seems hypocritical...Kidman is as she always is and I hope to see Ewan McGregor in some better movie. As against 'MR', his role in 'A Life Less Ordinary' seems too good! This movie can be a "novelty" for people only familiar with Hollywood movies. I'd not recommend it for any other thing than the cinematography.</fullReview>

I've to give credit for conceptualizing the movie and for putting all the $50 Million on the screen but in the end it fails grandly as a film.I know where Baz Luhrman comes from, I really liked his earlier movie 'strictly ballroom' but I could not sit through "Moulin Rounge". I also understand this movie is more about "form" than about story but even there it fails to produce anything good. Infact, this is a very badly done bollywood movie (and Hollywood movie) First, the story is total rip-off of Bollywood films and Bollywood cliches are all over the place. Two, the form is gaudy and no where as naive as Bollywood films. Three, this is nowhere near to the Hollywood musicals. Four, the direction the terrible.

		<fullReview>MR is definitely a "Spectacular Spectacular" to quote the play-within-a-play, but I could not call it a great musical, nor a great movie. While Kidman and McGregor do creditable jobs, neither have great voices, though they are probably enough for this opus. This is one of those cases where the sets outclass the story (what little there is of it) and the musical selections leave one in a weird time warp. It is a case of "Camille" meets "Cabaret" with dazzling but outlandish dances from a cabaret (which is what MR, which means "Red Mill" --as in a grist mill-- in French), with a subplot of Kidman's character getting "consumption" (tuberculosis) right out of "Camille" to provide the pathos (if not bathos). While the exterior sets are as outre as they are dazzling, it is the theatre set that especially takes one to the 'Gay Nineties' or 'La Belle Époque', as the Parisians of the day would have called it, in that it mirrors a risque Montmarte of Paris in 1900 before the decadence of that misty time was shattered by the harsh realities of the First World War. The term 'courtesan' is too nice for the prostitutes of that day or any day, but if one can suspend disbelief engendered by the raffish songs of our day against the opulence of that day, one can at least enjoy the movie on a strictly visual level. No, it did not deserve Academy Awards, but maybe an 'A' for effort. By the way, the ornate House Curtain (stage front drapery) is of some of the highest quality to be seen, but was once a standard of gorgeous theatres, and would cost about $50,000 today! Even its simple lambrequin in the position of the Grand Drapery did not diminish the opulent galloons used to create wonderful borders of metallic gold above the deep, bullion-style fringe upon the red velour, which was rigged in 'Opera' or 'Butterfly' pattern. For those who love this art form, there is an entire booklet with dozens of photos of such from the Theatre Historical Soc. of America in Elmhurst, Illinois 60126-2806 USA, (they have a web site) titled: "Grand Drapes, Tormentors, and Teasers" (types of stage draperies) by the late Terry Helgesen of Los Angeles.</fullReview>

Ewan McGregor does a fairly good job with a weak part (his character must be one of the dumbest human beings on earth). Jim Broadbent was very good as were some of the other supporting cast. However, when someone is dying of TB-it's called consumption for a reason-they can't usually spend their last few minutes dancing and singing under hot lights. I hate movies that do crap like that.

		<fullReview>"Moulin Rouge" is a film that requires an open mind to watch. As an experimental musical film, it divided audiences who were either enthralled or bewildered by it. After Ewan McGregor (Christian) sings a line from "The Sound of Music" in 1899 Paris, it's becomes apparent that this film is different from the usual film and willing to try new ideas. Especially after Christian sings the first complete song of the film "Your Song" by Elton John to Satine (Nicole Kidman), you either accept the use of pop songs from the 1950's through 1990's in 1899 Paris or you don't. If you don't, the film will probably begin to lose it's hold on you."Moulin Rouge" became a most favorite film for me upon my first viewing of it shortly after it's theatrical release. I left the film feeling wonderfully entertained! The art direction, cinematography, costumes and Nicole Kidman's performance as Satine are all very impressive!As a discerning film buff, I consider "Moulin Rouge" to be an excellent film overall, however it has a notable flaw: a flaw that I accepted. How Satine and Christian fall in love is not at all convincing, however their feelings for each other, especially when they sing together, is convincing. "Moulin Rouge" is not a film about character development, it's a film that celebrates love with bursts of passion and romance!"Moulin Rouge" is certainly a quirky, fast paced paced film that will not be to everyone's taste. In the end, however,I feel that director Baz Luhrman's gamble paid off. He's created a new kind of musical film that will influence future directors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow...I hardly know where to begin. This movie has so much going on that you will find yourself unable to get up from your seat for a snack or bathroom break. It's bizarre, funny, musical, and romantic all at once. It is a different kind of musical romance film. I can honestly say, with as many movies as I've seen, I have never seen a movie like this one. Nicole Kidman and Ewin McGregor surprised me with their musical abilities in this film. I truly enjoyed it and highly recommend it for any music lover, and for the true romantic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>can't get any better than this. Luhrmann is a master craftsman and inventor of a new cinema. Congratulations to everyone involved in the making and creation of the film. It takes awhile to adjust to the method of editing and use of special effects, mixing dialogue with song, great orchestrations with great acting, a huge achievement. In this world of quick fix cinema, the production is obviously a work of love, devotion and dedication. That itself is unique.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know the drill: Christian is a struggling writer who meets the courtesan Satine. They fall in love, but she belongs to the evil Duke.My two cents: This movie is... frustrating. There are some scenes that are arranged perfectly and deliver real emotional impact (tango to Roxanne comes to mind). Then there are others that make you wonder just what planet Baz Lurhmann is from (the Duke singing Like A Virgin)?The up and down style works against the movie more than for it. Just when you really start to become emotionally invested in the characters, something so insanely spoofy comes along that it ruins the whole moment. It's like the director couldn't decide whether he wanted to make high drama or Rocky Horror, so he decided to throw in a little of both, and they cancel each other out.If you're curious as to whether or not to go see this movie: If you like Rocky Horror, Rent or anything else by Baz Lurhmann, this is right up your alley. Otherwise, buy the soundtrack. You'll get all of the music and talent, without the distractions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard of this movie, I thought it could be halfway decent. It had Nicole Kidman (is she hot or what?), but the money I spent watching this movie could as well be spent in pain-killers.What a worthless piece of garbage ! I can´t believe how ugly and obnoxious this film is. After all, if I want to see a bunch of very fast frame changes/silly songs I go and watch MTV. This movie only ruined good songs like Smells like teen spirit (if Kurt Cobain watched this movie, he would want to kill himself all over again...) This movie ruined the reputation of good actors such as Ewan Mcgregor and Jim Broadbent.. Monkeys would direct this movie better than Baz "Powerpuff" Lurhmann. To sum up, this movie is REALLY bad. Work of art ? NO! If you´re g*y watch it, if not hate it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm tired...I really am. It's late. The star are shining on the sky, and despite the terrible disaster that took place today, life goes on...does the show go on? That's a question for which the current answer is, and will probably continue to be for some time: yes, it does. I read somewhere that Moulin Rouge was the kind of movie which one either loved or hated. I can't agree with this fact, as I would fall in between. It's hard for me to say it was an excellent movie and I certainly can not say it was a terrible one. I guess it usually depends on what you want to see.  An everlasting subject: love. Everlasting, but rarely changing any more. Some stereotypes have been set and they are repeated. You can not expect of this movie to stun you with innovative ideas about love, as you can not expect Paul Anderson to do a good movie out of Resident Evil. Sorry there...got carried away. Back to this film. I'd have to say a little confusing...totally lacking originality...sounding good, but not excellent. I know what happens when something sounds good, but not excellent: at first you enjoy it. Might happen the same thing the second and the third time. But then, the inevitable appears...it becomes boring. In the worst case, annoying. That's my opinion about the songs in this movie, and about the movie as a whole. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad...it can simply drive you mad! There's Nicole Kidman...yes, Nicole. I have just seen the movie, so I had little knowledge of her performance(in this movie) at the time of the Academy Awards. I was living under the impression that she would win, but it wasn't so. Sincerely speaking, I agree. I want to point out that I haven't seen the actual winning actress either, but I have my standards and Nicole wasn't good enough. She didn't make me feel the action...and she should've. On the other hand, Ewan was acceptable...but he wasn't anything special either. Actually, that's where the movie suffered. It didn't really get me connected, despite having a quite simple plot. I personally enjoyed the beginning most, until the story became routine. About love and how love will forever rule... I guess I just couldn't feel this movie. Strange thing to say, but I couldn't. It is worth to see though, because I'm sure others will feel it, and because there are some interesting things in it. The few original ones. I vote for a 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Splashy, but Unorginal Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say probably the best thing about this movie was the orginal arrangement and splicing of well-known songs. Sure the songs themselves are not orginal, but I really enjoy the creative use of them. Both soundtracks are a joy to listen to, except many of the songs are the orginal cut and not how they were played in the movie. Onto the problems. This is an out and out rip-off of Camille. Both stories are set in Paris at about the same era. Both Satine and Marguerite are women who use their bodies to get what they want. This later backfires when they actually fall in love with the wrong men. Both men come from poorer backgrounds but are armed with high ideals. There are also men in both stories using their money to buy the affections of Satine or Marguerite. To complete the case for plagerism, both women have consumption which plays a major role in their decisions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The biggest problem I had with this movie was that the music was not original. I mean, with the amount of money they spent making the film they could have bought some pre-written score or something rather than just take snippets of music from say, Elton John and the Sound of Music.**Possible Spoilers** I don't have any problem with the stars - the two leads have rather nice voices actually. But the plot? I'm sorry, maybe I'm a purist but the whole prostitute thing AND consumption - not an attractive concept.So, although the music isn't original and sometimes the characters get on my nerves, see it if you want to. I mean, don't buy it unless you've seen it. I'd give it a 6/10. If you like the concept of Moulin Rouge, see Chicago (2002), it's a lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Moulin Rouge"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Moulin Rouge was probably the most legendary nightclub in all France. Home to a delightfully eclectic group of artists,writers,musicians,actors,prostitutes,and aristocrats. But it was more than a nightclub,it's a piece of history. "Moulin Rouge" means red windmill.The building was a red windmill. The neighborhood "Montmartre" was the gathering place of artists and the poverty-stricken. I really encourage people to research the area of Montmartre and what the Moulin Rouge really was and all the great artists associated with it. If you know this it adds so much more to the movie. Just about every great mind in Paris at the time was there. Both the area Montmartre and the Moulin Rouge were pivotal points for art and modern culture. Check this out along with the significance of absinthe and the movie takes on another meaning. Actually it still exists in Paris. Only it's nothing like what it once was. Now it's just another theater with topless showgirls. But the history is amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>************Spoiler Warning**********************Moulin Rouge is one wild and uneven movie, at times causing me to nearly give up and turn it off, but ultimately it was worth it.What was hard for me to swallow was the sometimes skittish camerawork and dialogue, that made me feel I was watching the creation of a seventies Kung Fu director who'd decided to make an art film. Once the shock value wore off, however, it was a story I was able to get deeply into. As with most real stories it told and showed us at times things we didn't agree with, which is far better than most of the cookie cutter pablum that passes for storywriting today. We are asked at times to reach, and consider things we hadn't thought of before, which is infinitely preferable to stories that recycle what we already know is going to happen.The imagery and ambience of late 19th century France is captured well, brining to the screen a time when all the entertainment and fantasy to be had was found on stages and in plays, causing theaterhouses to be seen as magical environs where wishes could come true and life was somehow more real than the daily drudge of work and toil. The modern music actually fit in with the settings, adding rather than detracting. I was surprised how good the singing was, especially since most of the players were using their own voices. By far the best part of the movie was the conclusion, taking us briefly to a height of triumph and love, defiant against the odds, only to bring us down so quickly with stark tragedy, existential reality making the stage as life, where sooner or later the lights have to go out and the theater to empty.Moulin Rouge is not for everyone, nor a movie I totally related to. But it is an experience, and one I enjoyed and worth appreciating.</fullReview>

For instance, Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit") the Story (which i still loved, but was the only thing that was a little disappointing, it reminded me too much of Shakespeare in Love, but maybe it was just me) everything. Just the way that it doesnt hold anything back and just lets go, doing whatever it wants without getting to crazy all the time. Thats the main reason i love this movie. There should be more movies out there that take you to a totally different world and after watching it make you want to go and fall in love or whatever. Just my opinion.Other than a few similarities to some other films, this is a beautifuly creative movie that you should see, but only if your in for something a little crazy and different, or if you like good movies. 8/10</fullReview>

NOthing interesing there either, so we (well, actually mostly I...) settled for MR. I mumbled something about gay-icons and musicals something or other in general, and similar stuff and prepared to sleep through most of the movie. Consider when the movie took a grip of me. Wow! I've never seen a musical like this. The actors were great! It was like Ewan and Nicole really were in love. Amazing... ANd it wasn't long ago I saw Ewan starring in SW2 - Attack of the clones. Man, this actor is versatile. And Nicole then. I last saw her in The Others which also kept me on the edge, which is knda unusual for a american movie. Yeah, I know, you ppl are the best and everything, but movies are not your thing. It's like all hollywood-movies are made according to formular 1A, and always with that happy end... Bah! Anyway, along comes MR and the friday was saved. Great movie this, drama, comedy, music. It's got it all! Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't go and see Moulin Rouge at the cinema because most people who saw it told me not to bother, and I wasn't fond of musicals anyway. However, I watched it at a friend's house only last week for the first time and INSTANTLY fell in love with it. I bought it on DVD five days ago and have watched it about 10x already! Baz's R+J was my fave film but I must say this wonderful film has now taken its place. This film is so brilliant because of its ability to make you laugh one minute, and cry the next. It's a very simple love story set against a backdrop of amazing visuals and breathtaking dance sequences. I still see something new every time I watch this film - it is a real feast for the eyes. I was also very shocked but equally impressed by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman's voices. Yes, the songs are not new but you really don't notice that because of the stunning and unusual way the film is shot. They may as well be new songs because Ewan and Nicole cast them in a whole new light. Personally, I find the fast and shaking camera shots make the film much more interesting and inventive and anyone who cannot handle them is simply a 'lazy watcher' who cannot be bothered to concentrate hard enough to work out the different scenes. This film instantly draws you in and you simply cannot not watch it. Baz Luhrmann should have won an Oscar for this masterpiece, let alone been nominated. I think this film will become a classic. An absolute masterpiece, entertaining yet heartbreaking. I was astounded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different yet intriguing love story that I would recommend to all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched this movie was with a girlfriend late at night at her house. We rented it to try something different, and I wasnt expecting very good entertainment. All the reviews I had previously heard were that it was "weird" and "confusing, I walked out before it was even done". I had heard a glimpse of the soundtrack before though, (besides the 4 diva hit) and must say that Ewan McGregors voice surprised me. When we first started watchign it my friend immediatly dissmissed it and fell asleep claiming it was "retarded and strange". I kept watchign though, I dont give up that easily. I must say Im glad I did, for it was one of the most touching love stories Ive seen in a long time. The music was amusing (with modern remakes and mixes including Madonna, Elton John, Nirvana and Marilyn Monroe) and Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor shocked me- especially Ewan, his voice was so raw and passionate, it struck a deep chord within me. The plot is not expecially deep, but it got the classic villian, hero and heroin that every good love story needs. Both lead actors had outstanding preformances and Nicole deserved her Oscar nomination (though maybe there should have been another nomination for a certain male lead along with that). I have watched it again several times and amazingly am still not sick of it. WARNING though, the beginning is very strange but once you get past all the show and get into the real story it is well worth the wait. Note- 1st time viewers (and veterans as well) dont forget the tissue box, as the end is a tearjerker!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually sumptuous, but with little else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman is Satine, the harlot with a heart of gold, the star of the nightclub of dreams, the Moulin Rouge. Christian (played by Ewan McGregor) is the idealistic English poet who falls in love with her. A typical boy meets girl, boy loses girl story.This is the type of film that depends on visual splendor rather than on depth.The costumes and sets are all flashy Hollywood glamour. The color and visual lushness are utterly dazzling and mesmerizing, but you're barely given time to `ooh' before the camera cuts away. The sweeping, speeding cinematography and quick cuts give the film a glib, circus-ring-meets-music-video sort of appeal.However, the film fails to slow down its break-neck pace when in the proper places. So the love story is given unfortunate short shrift. The plot lurches between tragedy and comedy so abruptly that neither are believable. The tragedy is contrived and forced, while the comedy comes off as cartoonish.The acting is harder to comment on. Nicole Kidman's acting is decent, her singing passable, and Ewan McGregor has seen better acting days. But there is little chemistry between these actors at all. The two leads are both talented, but this is NOT a movie about characterization and depth. So, sadly, these actors aren't given much to work with. With such little character depth, it makes it harder for the audience to feel any empathy.And herein lies the movie's most frustrating aspect: its absolute inability to induce true emotion from the audience by allowing us to sympathize with these characters.Christian is merely identified by his love for Satine, which is possessive, nearing on the obsessive. But as far as the audience can tell, there is no concrete basis for their relationship. Belt out a rendition of Elton John's `Your Song' and Christian's got the girl. It left me to question Satine's supposed conviction not to fall in love if she could be so easily ensnared.This film had so much potential for rot-beneath-the glitter story, but instead it resorts to showy glitz and glamour to attract an audience.Vibrant, visually opulent, but lacking in the essential elements of a cinematic excellence: solid plot or characterization. All frosting and little cake.It's a bit like a bubble--it's very pretty on the outside, but there's not much substance underneath.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mouline Rouge I think that was only a vehicle to Mrs. Cruise to receive her first Oscar. However I've decide to see the movie, after the controversy of the film, where half of the critics loves it and the other half hate. My impressions were good. Of course is not A+, and the plot and script is too conventional, as most of the musical are. But the passion that made the director and cast remains to the eyes and ears of the audience. Buzz, recreates in his weak and MTV style a wonderful, opulent and decadent Paris. Nicole Kidman maybe she did not look as French cabaret girl, but she is beautiful and talent and give a lot of intensity to the role of Satine, but she is not the only sparkle gem, her love interest Ewan Mcgregor is excellent, in fact that guy can play every type of role (from the addict of Trainspotting to a dumb hunk in LV, with this movie we forgive his Obi Wan Kanobi in Ep1 (in AOTC was much better)John Leguisamo as Toulouse Lautrec was also good, however Jim Broabandt is the best of the cast. I think that some people hate the musical, because they don't like the pop of the 80's where the movie is inspired (a cameo of 80's superstar Kylie Minogue is include. I `ve got a little tired of Elton john Songs and specially the repetition of "all you need is love". But there are three exception. The very funny can can song that where guys try to convence the duke, the dark tango "Roxanne", and Kiman feelings in "like a virgin". In fact it's a movie that is save by the pasion of the director, cast and crew.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't see MR until the DVD was released. I'd heard many friends who both loved and hated the film, and from some reports, the use of modern music in a story set in 1899-1900 didn't bode well.And then I actually saw the movie.First, most of the film is some of the visually stunning material I've seen in many years. The use of color, shading, SFX combine for an incredible visual ride.As for the plot, well, either you buy into the "ride" or you don't. The use of late 20th century music didn't strike me as anachronistic since the entire movie seemed like a surreal fantasy rather than a story actually set in 1899.As for the music, either you like it or you don't. If it had been my film I would have made a few different choices, but most of the music worked for me, and some executions were simply spectacular, such as "Heros" and "Your Song".It's true that during the second half when the plot moves closer to denter stage, things drag, but they don't come to a screaming halt.It's been years since I approached a movie with such trepidation, due to the views of others, and came away liking it so much.</fullReview>

It tells the story of french night club star, Satine (Nicole Kidman) who tries to impress a Duke, but at the same time falls in love with a penniless writer, Christian (Ewan McGregor). Their secret affair brings with it excitement and tragedy!The music in Moulin Rouge is one of the best soundtracks i have heard, and includes the hit song Come What May.

While I disliked the use of modern music in 'Knight's Tale' because I felt it was inappropriate, here the modern music meshes with the story and the characters sing their lines in way to reveal their powerful emotions.The scenery is gaudy and incredible, and the Moulin Rouge nightclub is the period's Studio 64. The story has depth, but is straight-forward in its delivery.Nicole and Ewan sing and dance, following a classic love story retold with fresh appeal.I've watched the DVD many times. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a mix of a lot of things.The story isn't so inusual, if you know some Operas, and the only thing that is really original is the use of cameras and special effects.A pleasant movie with a sad ending (like the Operas) that hooked people mainly for the use of well known pop song ("Roxanne" - "Material girl" - "Show must go on" - "Your song" and so on ...). The movie also pay an (involontary?) tribute to Terry Gilliam's and Monty Python's crazy visual style.Not the best ... but good in spite of a trite love story.A particular note for the breathless editing.My vote 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If not possibly /the/ best. I fell in love with the movie during the first few minutes. I had been interested, but had assumed it was another romance story. No. The story is about a deeper love than mere romance without friendship. The plot is incredible. It had me laughing so hard at times, but drawn so strongly to it's allure I could not break away, and was devastated by the tragic ending. Even though the first minute of the film tells you it will be a tragic ending, you still don't want to believe...It's difficult for me to assess this film because I cannot separate it from the emotions it evoked. Suffice to say, it left me breathless, dazzled, seduced, laughing, anxious, fearful, and broken. Truly not something anyone should miss, I recommend this film to /everyone./</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is a place in Paris, who is shown in this film in a form, its never have existed. In his fast comedy speed this film is like a a run on a highway. And on the other side, in his tragic moment, he nearly stopped the time. He is between fun and tragic, love and death. Kidman as Satine, the star in the Moulin Rouge sing in the beginning an old but very famous Marilyn Monroe Song "Diamonds are Girls best friend" who had also a return in Madonnas "Material Girl" in the 80ties. The film mixed it in one moment. But Kidman sing a cooler version as Monroe and more sophisticated as Madonna. When she sing "Heroes" together with her lover the make it better than David Bowie himself, because when she sing "I drink all the time you" she drinks not like Bowie "the time" -she drinks tea all the time. Thats it! The story is a really simple love story, but thats not the point, what this film makes with it, is really exiting. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I refused to watch this movie for close to a year. My husband finally talked me into renting it and I have to admit that I wasn't impressed with the first 15 minutes of the movie. But I was soon glued to the television monitor. I fell in love with this movie! So much so, that I purchased it the very next day along with the soundtrack. I was never a big fan of Nicole Kidman, until her magnificant performance in Moulin Rouge. And as for Ewan McGregor - Wow!!! I have since watched just about every movie he has been in and I must admit that he is a superb actor and quite handsome... I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Just remember that the first 15 minutes may be a little unorthodox, but sit through it and you too will agree that this is a fantastic movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved it. At the same time, as an artist... I was unsure how to feel about it. The modern music was a bit hard to take at first... I wasn't sure how to react. I would have preferred that they had written an all original score and songs for it... THE MOVIE WOULD HAVE BEEN A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER. BUT IT WAS STILL INCREDIBLE. IN FACT the modern musical elements made it so beautiful that its hard for me to argue either point... I LOVE IT DESPITE THE UNORIGINAL SCORE. Its was beautifully done in every respect. AND IT TOOK A LOT OF TALENT AND PLANNING TO FIND ALL THOSE SONG LYRICS AND TIE THEM TOGETHER AS WELL AS THEY DID. THE ROXANNE (POLICE) BIT WAS INCREDIBLE... A WONDERFULLY POWERFUL PIVOTING MOMENT IN THE FILM. IT WAS PERFECT. Overall... the acting was done so very well, exaggerated at times... but done perfectly to make it fit with the theme... THEY ARE ON ABSINTH (AS IF YOU COULDN'T TELL). The visuals were very impressive and cinematography was brilliant. Everything was so cohesively put together that you just can't help but love this eye candy. The ear candy was wonderful too. An Original score would have made it even better. But its hard to argue that considering the Moulin Rouge theme...and that they would have played music of the time in the club... (hint, hint) and they are on drugs... which you can't deny is one of the central points in the visual nature of this film. Notice the glasses with green liquid in them. And those green letter that say absinth after they all drink some. I LOVED THE MOVIE AND YOU REALLY JUST CAN'T CHANGE A THING. IF YOU DID IT WOULD DEFEAT THE PURPOSE OF THE MOVIE.Maybe they'll make a sequel with an original score for you with a different nightclub and center it around LSD. (Dream on guys the movie is fine)Just enjoy this movie for what it is. A brilliant masterpiece with tribute to a lot of great artists. (AND I DON'T MEAN THE MODERN LADY MARMALADE GIRLS {I'M STILL UPSET ABOUT THAT; but I don't need to rant about that here, the movie was thankfully free of them except the song in the shallowness of the can-can dancing scene, where they belong ;)}</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is probably my favorite movie of all time. How could it not be? The Passion, the humor, the love, the plot, the music... The Ewan McGregor? ^_^ It may be a little strange at first, but the story brings you right in, and you just have to find out what happens! This is a movie for those love to laugh, cry, and sing along. This movie is about a young English Writter, named Christian who comes to Paris in 1900 to write about what he believes in above all else... Love. But what are you to to when you've never been in love? Through a sequence of events, he is hired to write a new play called "Spectacular, Spectacular" for the Moulin Rouge, a night club that is about to turn into a theater. Christian meets Satine, the sexy star of the Moulin Rouge who has dreams of becoming a real actress. When the two meet, it's almost love at first sight. As they continue to be together and write the show, the "Evil" Duke, who wants Satine to himself, tries to have his own way, creating the problems. The music, even though it is not entirely original, is Awesome. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman hit every note perfect, and their voices blended quite well. It's a must see for any true Child of the Revolution. ~*Beach Monkee*~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dear to be touched?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few films that have affected me in the same way as Moulin Rouge does. You rent, or go to the movies, and most of the time it is to be entertained for couple of hours, while forgetting your own struggles in life. Here we have a film that takes you beyond that, as you will completely forget everything and you become part of a wonderful love story in a movie which is unlike anything I've ever seen. When I first heard about Moulin Rouge, I didn't expect much. Nicole Kidman has always disappointed me, with the only two films I've liked her in being Far and Away &amp; Eyes Wide Shut. Ewan McGregor has, even for his talent, not always delivered, and is Star Wars the saddest example. To top this, I just couldn't imagine a Musical to be worth seeing. I mean beside old films like Sound of Music, Mary Poppins, West Side Story and Grease, are there any real musicals out there? All my doubts were swept away seeing Moulin Rouge for the first time. It grabs you, and doesn't let go until many days later. The combination of music that we all partly know performed in a new way, the visual settings and camera work, the strange combination of comedy, drama, reality and fantasy. All fantastically well put together, brings us a film unlike any others. I dear to say that if you hate it, you didn't allow it to capture you, deciding rather to stay out of range, untouched and unharmed. For all the rest of you, enjoy the journey. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, "Moulin Rouge!" has been panned as a one-dimensional chick flick with lots of pretty colors and flashy dance numbers but no true depth. However, the brilliance of the movie lies in it's delivery. Essentially, most tragic love stories are the same. This movie elevates itself to greatness due to the masterful direction of Baz. The frantic pace only serves to dazzle us more; the blinding colors and chaotic musical numbers truly make this film a tour de force. The characters of Christian, Satine, Loutrec, Zidler, and the Duke are delivered splendidly by obviously talented actors. The difference between many love stories and "Moulin Rouge!" is that this film actually tries...everything jumps out at the viewer to deliver the Bohemian message of truth, beauty, freedom, and love in an eye-popping way. Many who see this movie will be left breathless; and muttering the timeless, honorable theme: "the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return." Now that is the mark of a great movie. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Encouraged by all those good reviews it´s gotten I finally decided to rent Moulin Rouge last weekend. To be honest I wasn´t expecting much. I thought it would be one of those movies that critics love and "normal" people find just okay. Boy was I wrong! Rarely have I seen such a visually impressive and dynamic film and after the first few minutes I was hooked! I was impressed mostly by the images, but also by the performances and music. The story might be nothing new, but all the other ingredients of the film lift it above many other love stories. This is definitely one of the best performances Nicole Kidman has ever given. Now I´m seriously thinking about buying the soundtrack and the DVD which seems to be loaded with special features. I already have the single Come What May which is a stunning ballad performed by Nicole and Ewan McGregor. Those two really know how to sing. I´m not 100% sure whether Moulin Rouge deserves 8 or 9 out of 10, but in any case it´s one hell of a movie! Now I´m looking forward to seeing Nicole´s supernatural thriller The Others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is magical and incredible.The performances are perfect.The cast was perfect.And the music!Oh the music! First of all Baz Luhrman is a very creative director he made the most astonishing and original movies of all times.Strictly Ballroom is quite excellent and with a very funny cast.The most dull and unoriginal film of his career is Romeo + Juliet.But Moulin Rouge is just a masterpiece that will definately enter in my 10 most important movies' list.And in third place only behind the amazing Matrix and the great Gattaca. This is a love it or hate it movie.Cause it's only for people who enjoy music and recognize those crazy medleys which was very well organized by the musician Craig Armstrong,who unfortunately wasn't even nominated for the 2001 Academy Award.You will remember in the songs musics like `All you need is love',or the funniest scene on the movie when they sing `Like a Virgin',or the most memorable scene the Tango of `Roxanne'.And plus Nicole Kidman and Mcgregor sing like professional singers,they're excellent! Nicole playing Satine is incredible!It's her best performance ever!Stays between her `The Others' performance.She's so beautiful and charming!Satine is so natural and never lose her shape.It's the portrail of a great woman with courage and strong felings.Mcgregor playing Christian is trully deep.He keeps an intense love for Satine who can't fall in love.Their destiny is realistic and sad.Having a forbidden love is not easy ,specially in those years on Paris. The beginning of the movie is extremely crazy.But you'll laugh all the way when the artists start singing `Smell like teens spirit' or `Lady Marmalade'.Everything fits.It was planned and special for all who loves music. Well I won't take more time of you.But even if you don't like it remember that the movie world is separated by before and after Moulin Rouge.After this motiom picture nothings gonna be the same.9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a little bit funny... this feeling inside... After watching Moulin Rouge, I did feel that way. It was weird, seeing such an amazing movie. It just has so much OOMPH in it. The actors and actresses look like they're enjoying themselves unlike in some movies where they have expressions on their faces like "only 5 more months of filming... only 5 more months of filming"Basically, I loved this movie. I have seen it soo many times and have never gotten tired of it. It grows on me more and more. Except the only problem now is that I have to remember not to recite all the lines that I've memorized (the whole movie) and let the actors talk.Ewan... what can you say about him? He looks AMAZINGLY FANTASTIC in this movie. I just wish they would've showed more of him. Oh well.Nicole... great singer... great actress... Ewan and her are a perfect movie couple. (But hmm... they seem a little too close sometimes if you know what I mean)Can you imagine someone like Heath Ledger playing Christian? Or Catherine Zeta-Jones or Renee Zelwegger playing Satine? Crazy.Anyway, I give this movie a 10/10. Like Baz Luhrman originally said (but my way), its like a record that you can play over and over again and never get sick of. The graphics and effects are great, the costumes are unreal. Moulin Rouge is like a fairy tale that you just lose yourself in watching.</fullReview>

But the real prize should go to Baz Lurman the director. He beautifully told this story by creatively using fun modern music, weaving the images together masterfully.

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, lovely, amazing film about "truth, beauty, freedom, but above all, love"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, before I first saw this movie (my friend Jessica dragged me to the theatre) I was utterly skeptical (this was before the Oscar nods and raving reviews). How could a musical about a nightspot with a stale, old plot be any good? In more ways than I could have dreamed.The acting is spectacular, as are the cast's voices. Ewan MacGregor and Nicole Kidman sing and act beautifully; their chemistry jumps right off the screen! MacGregor has one of the loveliest voices I've ever heard. Listening to him belt out "Your Song" is amazing (not to mention the fact that his smile makes me melt). How did he not get an Oscar nomination?!? Jim Broadbent (as the exuberant Harold Zidler, the "king" of the Moulin Rouge) is fantastic in his supporting role, and Richard Roxburgh as the villianous Duke is perfect for the part. Baz Luhrmann is an utter genius. A genius! It has so many of his special little touches that make the film unique and original. I can think of few other directors who could pull this off with as much grace as he did. It was a cinematic crime that he was robbed of an Oscar nomination. (This movie recieved far less Oscar recognition than it deserved).The story may have been used many times in the art of film, but Luhrmann and Craig Pearce (his co-writer) make it stunningly unique. It's heartbreaking yet beautiful. There are few other movies that touch the heart such as this.The music is spectacular! Reinventing many songs such as "Roxanne", "Your Song", and "Like a Virgin" (though I must admit I found that sequence a bit unnecessary) was delightful to watch, and I especially loved the "Elephant Love Medley" where Christian sings a mixture of classic love songs including "All You Need is Love", "Love Lifts Us Up Where We Belong", "Just One Night", and "I Will Always Love You" in attempt to convince Satine that they "could be heroes forever and ever". The few originals of the movie (such as Satine's hopeful melody "One Day I'll Fly Away" and the wonderful, beautifully lyrical "Come What May") are absolutely FANTASTIC!All in all, this movie is stunning. This movie is colourful. This movie is beautiful. This movie is heartbreaking. This movie is hopeful. This movie is quietly happy. This movie is more than just a movie. It is a secret longing to be loved, and loved alone that we all have inside us, which whether we have it boldly out in the open, like Christian; or silently locked in away inside so that barely even we know, like Satine, is undoubtedly there. See this movie. You won't regret it. the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return....</fullReview>

I have 2 admit the first time i watched it after the first say 15-20 minutes i was thinking to myself 'what the hell?' but then after a while you really get into it and find yourself really enjoying it. It's brilliant the way they include so many different songs into it, i loved that. The actors were incredable and choosen brilliantly for the parts and it was so quick moving that you were never bored. You were sat on the edge of your seat thinking ' oh my god what is gonna happen next and how is this going to end?'There were so many colours and the costumes and set were fantastic.I have seen this quite a few times now and would never say no 2 watching it again. It always takes you through so many emotions :) Some of the bits make u laugh because they r so 'toungue in cheek' other bits make u happy and then i have 2 admit i cried at the end - im sure im not the only one!This film was brilliant in every way a film can be.This is a film about truth, beauty, freedom but above all love.All u need is loveEXCELLENT STUFF :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Moulin Rouge!": "Obnoxious Drivel Devoid of Any Dignity Whatsoever" or "A Lovely Romantic Story"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that I had extreme misgivings (mostly deserved) for "Moulin Rouge!" And though I quite liked Baz Luhrmann's "Romeo+Juliet," "Moulin Rouge!" wasn't the least bit appetizing for me. Well, that isn't entirely true; I very much wanted to see the lavish costumes, spectacular sets, and lush colors. And after seeing a clip of Nicole Kidman singing in a Tv interview (and liking what I heard), I wanted to hear more.This movie abruptly morphs from an in emotionally-insipid, methamphetamine-pumped, seizure-inducing, one-dimensional cinematic failure of epic proportions into a tolerable, almost-touches-your-heart love story. The flow of the story itself and the personalities of the characters do such a quick unbelievable 180 that I'm left with no choice but to review each half of the movie separately.~First HalfGiven all the energetic promos, one would think "Moulin Rouge!" starts with an offensive explosion of mind-blowing pomp and outrageous fanfare of debauchery. On the contrary, it starts off pretty interesting with a little man singing mournfully in a gloomy town greyed with melancholy. In a dingy closeted hotel room, the grieving writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) drags his heavily pain-ridden heart to his typewriter to tell his story, their story--a story of a man and a woman who fell in love only to lose out to Fate and its cruelty. This is a completely unexpected mood for the beginning of this story. It made me think, "Oh....Maybe this won't be as bad as I thought.."But, have no fear, movie-goers, the "offensive explosion of mind-blowing pomp and outrageous fanfare of debauchery" DOES happen--only a few minutes later than expected, and a whole lot more offensive and sickening. And when I say "sickening," I do mean literally. The too-ugly characters (due to overdone make-up) and their too-quick movements and their too-fast speech, and the too-quick camera cuts all made me want to throw up.The year is 1899. Why do you watch a movie set in 1899? To experience another era, to get lost in the wondrousness of that time: its song, its dance, its dress, its society? To even romanticize it? No, no, no! The movie doesn't allow you to do this. Why? Because you have a bunch of tawdry people screaming and singing songs that you know don't belong in this time, leaving some center inside of you fighting what you're hearing and seeing as if it were blasphemous. That's why.Now, one may say that maybe the director *wants* you to be offended by what goes on in the Moulin Rouge. But it isn't so much what happens there that offends you--as all you're seeing is singing and dancing--but the camera cuts and the too-fast speech are what's offensive. It's too fast to follow (and you're talking to a woman who surfs the internet, watches "Braveheart," does math homework, and listens to the radio--all at the same time! She sings along to the radio, she reads her little newsgroups, and she can look at the Tv to see as well as hear her favorite "Braveheart" scenes at the proper times since she can devote part of her brain to following the storyline. And, yes, sometimes she even likes a little taste of Rob Zombie's "Living Dead Girl" and "Dragula"). As I was saying, it's so visually offensive you can't even appreciate the costumes, the singing, and the choreography. It's like getting a spa treatment and at the same time being forcefed liquified earwax and toothpaste soup from a toilet. Extremely unpleasant. Extremely frustrating.Why didn't I just turn it off? One, I wanted to finish watching this movie so I could rip it apart here. And two, I still wanted to hear Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor sing "Come What May."Actually, it isn't so much visually-offensive as it is scary. When thinking of the jerky camera movements, I suspect this movie was directed by a bunch of mental patients overdosing on speed.Even before seeing all the action in the Moulin Rouge, you're subjected to the same jerky camera cuts and rapid speech in Christian's hotel room where he joins with Bohemian revolutionaries (John Leguizamo among them). There is a lot of dialogue, but sadly you can only snatch a word here and there. You don't get what's being said or who's saying it. Obviously, it makes it extremely difficult--if not impossible--to understand what's happening. This scene ends with a cameo by a green fairydust-sprinkling singing Kylie Minogue Tinkerbell that leaves you thinking, "What the heck was that?" and wondering what Christian and his new Boho friends were smoking.Speeding ahead, they have the guy-sees-girl-across-a-crowded-room-and-it's-love-at-first-sight scene. When courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman) and Christian finally are alone together, she thinks he's the regular "visitor" and puts on her sex kitten act, leaving him completely flustered but wanting to break through to the real Satine. She finally catches on that he isn't her regular John. "Big Bad Guy" Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh) has been promised a romp in the hay with Satine and interrupts Christian and Satine. While Christian hides and tries to sneak out, Satine distracts the Duke. Her gift of "[making men] believe what they want to believe" backfires when the Duke falls in love with her and believes she loves him in return. As the Duke's finances are crucial to the Moulin Rouge and Satine's career, it puts Satine in an obvious predicament.Unfortunately, not a bit of what I was able to understand of the plot makes the least bit of difference. The dialogue was hard to catch and the characters were all so one-dimensional. It's as though the overblown pomp and special effects left the director no time for attention to dramatic details such as lingering closeups and time for the viewers to believe in the lovers' love for each other. What's worse is that Kidman and McGregor have no chemistry. It's not for lack of trying; They just don't have it. It often seems that they act within their own little "boxes," acting *at* each other as opposed to *with* each other. Basically, you're left with nothing substantial for your heart to soak in. It's quite sad as the second half of the movie suddenly slows down enough to draw you into the lovers' world..~Second HalfThis part of the movie is somewhat enjoyable since it's a bit more coherent than its first half. You're often in a slow mode of suspense, wondering exactly how this story will turn out.The one downside, however, is that the style of the movie and some characters do a complete 180. There is more dialogue *not* at warp speed and less overblown production numbers, leaving more room for story and true character interaction. Also, Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent) changes from a greedy, seedy, one-dimensional, immoral PimpDaddy to a starting-to-care nearly Father-like sorta-sympathetic figure. Suddenly, he has another side to him. But this totally doesn't wash with the first half of the movie. There is no transition that I can see.~What Did I Like?Kidman was good, as was McGregor. But neither of them deserve nominations. Leguizamo was excellent as he is in all he does. Richard Roxburgh was quite effective; He made me hate his character so much it will take me a great deal to separate him from "The Duke's" disagreeable image should he be in a different role in the future.~What Did I Love?The costumes were better than excellent, particularly Satine's outfits. They didn't look the least bit cheap or cheesy. My favorite was Satine's oriental-style gown, the one with the wine-colored empire-waisted bottom and gold-embroidered black kimono-style top, topped off with a bejeweled golden fanned-halo headpiece fit for an Empress. It is the most beautiful costume I've ever seen, and it made me feel dumpy in my super-baggy Pepto-pink sweater and sweatpants.The look of the movie was quite good. The sets were gorgeous, particularly Satine's luxurious red-toned room which resembled a jewelry box. The computer-generated city was realistic in a fantasy sort of way. Unfortunately, they didn't give us time to really look at them, giving the viewer a feeling of sprinting through an art gallery.The characters themselves were done up quite well. McGregor was sexy. Kidman was trussed up as beautifully as an art piece--Not too difficult as the combination of flawless skin, long wavy red hair, and defined blue eyes is classic.The lighting was genius. Whatever was done brought out every red and blue color and displayed it to its fullest and deepest.I love "Come What May." Kidman's and McGregor's voices mesh well for this song.~What Would Have Made It All Better?Number One? Chemistry. Kidman and McGregor didn't even convince me that they were friends. They were actors playing a part and they seemed like actors playing a part. Why the director didn't notice this right away and point it out and at least attempt to create some chemistry is beyond me.Number Two? Original songs. The constant barrage of well-known relatively-modern hits left me disoriented, though I actually like these songs well enough. Everytime a lyric was uttered, my mind would instantly call up the original singer and start comparing every inflection to the original version, distracting me from the storyline and ultimately destroying the illusion that I was in 1899 to witness this love story. The effect is about as unpleasant as being doused with cold water during a dream-filled sleep.Number Three? Dialogue. DO NOT use, I repeat, DO NOT use lyrics from those well-known hits in regular speech between characters. Why? One, it still creates the aforementioned effect. Two, from a man's mouth, it comes off as a really bad "pick-up line." Three, a bunch of balding old men dressed as bankers singing and bopping around to Nirvana's hard-rockin' 'n' head-bashin' "Smells Like Teen Spirit" makes Carlton Banks of "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" look like Fred Astaire. This can only evince pity in the viewer.Number Four? Speed. I know you love the fast cuts, Baz, but this was just too much. I seriously wonder if he should avoid lawsuits and slap a warning label on it, informing the viewer that this movie could induce seizures. Seriously.~Why Is "Romeo+Juliet" So Much Better?One, a good number of those songs, though modern, weren't well-known to me; They were also background music and didn't wind up as lines of conversation. Two, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes had warmth and chemistry, not to mention shining true talent (at least back then for DiCaprio). Three, the cuts weren't quick and numerous enough to steal focus from the story of the lovers. Four, and most importantly, the dialogue was still Shakespeare, thus allowing "Romeo+Juliet" and its actors to retain their DIGNITY.~ConclusionI will not reveal what happens at the end of the movie, as that would spoil it. My recommendation is to watch the movie from start to finish so you can see for yourself. If the second half of the movie agrees with you, in future viewings you may want to fastforward about an hour, or at the very least look away from the quick-cut sequences since it's about as harmful to your mind as a solar eclipse is to your eyes. And don't forget the Tylenol for the inevitable headache you'll get as you try to take in the dialogue.On a "report card" scale.. First half: D- Last half: C+ Could have been a: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie you will adore or hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have very mixed feelings about this movie. The elements that work, they work wonderfully. The aspects that don't work, well, oh brother.Things that work-Nicole Kidman-she steals the show with her classic beauty, charm, charisma and sheer star power. She was perfect casting.-The sets- The sets were beautiful. You can tell a lot of work was put in these stunning sets. They're wonderful eye candy._The costumes- I wanted to design costumes for plays when I was young.So I was impressed with the outfits. Heck if I was twenty pounds thinner I would use similar dresses for Halloween._Ewan Mcgregor -Even though through the whole movie all he does is act lovesick and pout. For people who only know him as Obi-Wan it shows his wide range of talent. Bad things about the movie_The music-There's just something wrong about using Nirvana and madonna songs for 19th century France. It's just tacky. It's almost as if Baz Luhrman thinks that modern audiences won't tolerate showtunes so top 40 hits must be used. I understand his logic on using modern music, but it almost insulting for musical lovers.-The love story- I watched this after having a massive fight with my finance so maybe I was too cynical. But it's so phony and Disney-esque. But how could anybody not be cynical about falling in love in three seconds over a Elton John song? -the shrieking- how come all through out the first half on the movie every character was to shriek and yell their lines? I found it very annoying.On a another note Is it just me or does Nicole Kidman seems to beautiful and active for someone who is dying? Also doesn't the Duke look amazingly like David Spade?Over all a very mixed bag. I'm a musical fan and I wasn't sure what to make of it. From reading the reviews people adore or just don't get it. I'm in the middle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's face it, a huge chunk of money was sunk into MOULIN ROUGE! and when you're working with a big budget you can make visual miracles a reality. It's the same thing Lucas did with STAR WARS, EPISODE 1, another dazzling display of visual technique. That said, this film, like EPISODE 1, is completely empty and worthless beyond the asthetics, and it's bludgened to death by overlength and cornball dramatics. I just don't get the appeal of these things. I'd also like to note that escapist cinema is a good thing, but it does NOT have to insult our intelligence. I think I had a difficult time swallowing this because of the ineffectual, cliche-ridden and cheesy dialogue &amp; plot developments, but apparently that didn't matter to many people since this landed smack in the middle of the Top 250 list and got nominated for so many awards.Ewan McGregor is becoming a sell-out (just look what big bucks did to once-good actors Jeff Goldblum and Nicolas Cage) and Nicole Kidman is asked to do very little than stand around a look ravishing (she's very good at that, but why couldn't Madonna have played this role?). Baz Luhrmann's intentions here are to get across that (I'm quoting him from the 2002 Oscar telecast) "Love is the big picture!" I respond with a big fat "No sh*t there, Baz!" OK, so the execution of the worn out plot is different, but if hyperkinetic camerawork, spastic characters bouncing off the walls and overkill special FX is the price I have to pay for originality, then I'll pass.Little rings true in this film. The emotions are forced and fake. The reinterpretations of classic songs are terrible, the singing voices are pretty mediocre...Catherine Martin and others did brilliant work with the art direction and costumes and she was rightfully applauded, so I will give the film that much. A far as this new age of musicals, Lars von Trier's DANCER IN THE DARK is leagues better than this attention-hogging "musical for a new millenium." Bjork delivered a haunting performance in DANCER that easily eclipses Kidman's work here (and I don't mean to state the obvious by adding she's a much better singer). Unfortunately for the Icelandic elfen princess, she's not as easy on the eyes as Kidman...and that seems to be what's most important to movie-goers and critics.I recommend DANCER over this any day, but I always applaud originality, even when it doesn't actually work as is the case with MOULIN ROUGE!, so...Score: 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was REALLY looking forward to this. The opening credits only heightened the anticipation and for the first twenty minutes or so it was a magnificent spectacle, but then the film got bogged down in repetitive padding. The musical numbers seemed ten times as long as they needed to be and I started to get both bored and irritated, a mood which carried on to the end credits - a shame, as performances were great and the whole film looked absolutely stunning. But I would rather have had more of a script which did justice to the film rather than the same bloody Elton John song seemingly over and over again. I shall rent it out at a later date, just to enjoy the beauty all over again, but I'll be fast forwarding over a lot of the musical bits......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The potency of cheap music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers. As usual. Was it George Orwell who talked about the potency of cheap music? Or Dennis Potter? No, he was the one who described the songs with which he bolstered his work as "vomit". Nice man. Whoever it was, cheap music has never been more potent than in "Moulin Rouge", a swirling, dizzying, annoying, wonderful mess of a movie, in which songs that any right-thinking individual would happily run a million miles to avoid are turned into spine-tingling little wonders of emotion and power. How is this done? Simply by getting two of the 21st Century's most attractive stars - McGregor and Kidman - to sing them. I never would have believed it possible for me to enjoy a version of Elton John's "Your Song" so much. In fact, it's almost embarrassing how enjoyable this film is. Sure, there are mistakes - the "Like a Virgin" debacle, the desperately unfunny antics of Ewan's sidekicks, who have very little to do except be irritating - but the end result is truly a work of pop culture greatness. Kidman and McGregor are largely responsible for why this movie works so well. They glow, they shine, they sparkle, they radiate, they have an amazing on-screen chemistry, they sing (They SING!), they are Stars. Watching them is the most awesome pleasure I've had in a cinema since "Breakdance II - Electric Boogaloo". And I'm not just saying that. "Moulin Rouge" is not perfect - critics who accuse it of self-indulgence and inanity are not exactly wrong, but they miss the point: it's a film about surface and image and glamour and silly lovesongs and the deep and profound pleasure those trivial things can provide. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We'll always have the Green Fairy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously, this movie has its audience, though I'm not among them. I had to watch the DVD in increments, since it made me restless and impatient. "Moulin Rouge" is well cast and handsomely produced, but its thinly-plotted tale of star-crossed lovers serves only as a framework on which to hang an endless succession of musical numbers, many of which simply don't work, or go on too long, or both. Set in 1900 Paris, the movie makes use of pop songs and show tunes that are well out of period, ranging from "Lady Marmalade" to "Roxanne" to "Like a Virgin" (the occasion for an embarrassingly forced and awkward dance number) to "Your Song," to name just a very few. I've liked "Your Song" for 30 years, but if one more character, one more time, had said, "It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside," I'd have hit the STOP button once and for all. One moment, and one moment only, in "Moulin Rouge" works the intended magic on me: the Green Fairy, a wicked Tinkerbell, springs to hallucinatory life from the label on a bottle of absinthe, trailing a shower of green sparks. The scene (which comes in the movie's first ten minutes, more's the pity) is less than a minute long, but manages to feature overlapping musical quotes from "The Hills are Alive," "Children of the Revolution," and the theme song from the movie "The Boy with Green Hair" (the song about the "very strange enchanted boy"). I watched that scene about 50 times before finally returning the DVD to the video store. More of her fairy dust and this movie might have worked better. All told, though, "Moulin Rouge" is frustrating, irritating, and hyperactive. As the French say, chacun a son gout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann has been quoted (or was it one of the producers?) as saying he was trying to make a musical for the future. Well, how can one make even a modern musical when the heroine is dying of consumption (i.e. tuberculosis, same as Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy). I can just see Susan Sontag bringing out a new edition of her essay-book "Illness as Metaphor" just to combat this movie's totally old-fashioned depiction of a woman dying beautifully from consumption (doesn't she *just* glow when she coughs up blood?). Countless stories over the years (at least according to Sontag) have ended with these romanticised, tragic literary deaths (more recently, these deaths are from AIDS or cancer).Another thing that makes Moulin Rouge! old-fashioned is the fact that the music is (almost?) entirely pre-existing, most from the Eighties (two whole songs by Madonna) and some even older ("Sound of Music" and "My Song," both of which were apparently written by Christian, not Rodgers and Hammerstein and Barry Taupin and Elton John). In fact, in many ways, the movie seems to be a relic of the Eighties--like Ferris Bueller, the villain is a loud obnoxious clown of a person, while the heroes are young and more "honest" (supposedly exemplified by the midget/sitar that "can tell no lies"). In the end, the movie is just a rehash-on-speed of Titanic, all the way down to the frame that indicates who lives and who dies at the very beginning.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...how truly overrated this film is. Yes, the costumes are bright and exciting, yes, the cinemotography is interesting and unique but aside from those two things, there is nothing good about this movie! Good Lord! Who told Nicole Kidman she could sing? She is AWFUL! Her voice barely chokes out of her pasty throat. As for the acting, that was possibly even more atrocious! I think I would have ended my life right then and there if Kidman had won for best actress at the oscars. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Ewan McGregor is a whole nother story. What did Baz Luhrman do to this otherwise great actor? NOt only could the boy not hold a tune, he had no charisma whatsoever in this film (something McGregor ALWAYS has). Not only that, his supposed "english" accent was terrible! I felt embarrassed for everyone involved in this film. Especially with the opening sequence of "Smells Like Teen Spirit." Oh! Words cannot express my pain for the film makers. As a fan of musicals, this was nothing to take notice of. It counted on winning its audience by cheesy musical version pop-songs (they couldn't even do more than one original) instead of an interesting plot, characters and good script. If he were alive today, Kurt Cobain would never have allowed this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really did enjoy watching this film, but i would be hesitant to reccomend it to an unsuspecting audience. The plot was incredibely banal, a golden hearted hooker meets lovelorn poet story. Which will triumph in the end "True Love" or "Love of Money"? The suspense might actually get to you, if weren't for the exceedingly effected acting style of the two main characters. Not to say that all the acting is awful, John Leguizamo and Jim Broadbent were fantastic in their supporting roles, as were most of the other minor characters. Once i stopped paying attention to the plot and the lovers, however, i really enjoyed the film. In addition to Baz Luhrman's eclectic genius, Something must be said for the absolute neon brilliance of Catherine Martin, the production designer (who also did such a fantastic job with Baz's other films, Romeo+Juliet and Strictly Ballroom)as well as the cinematographer Donald McAlpine. The world they created was absolutely beautiful to watch. Everything visually was stunning to the utmost degree. However, while the gaudy decadence of the set and frantic editing pace appealed to me, it may overwhelm some audience members. As a rule of thumb, if you don't like fast paced jumpy editing sequences (think MTV or Baz's other big hit Romeo+Juliet), you proboly won't enjoy the visual effects of this film. As a musical i couldn't decide if this made the cut. Certainely the opening brothel number was fast-paced and exciting, but the majority of the rest of the songs were all sappy love song clips which i thought fell a bit flat. I just didn't feel the excitment of that opening song was ever recaptured throughout the rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McGregor saves the day!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to watching Moulin Rouge! , I only heard amazing things about this movie. However I was warned that it IS a musical, and I was not sure how well this movie was really made since I am not a fan of musicals. As the movie begins Ewan McGregor's narration lays an impression on the viewer. The opening scene is serious and sad when McGregor is explaining what has happened. His narration continues the movie changes rapidly into a ridiculous comedy that does not seem appealing at all. It continues for another hour to have this great touch of a ridiculous comedy which is not funny I might add. The first hour of the movie was completely boring and seemed very weak, however in certain scenes McGregor proved his acting ability very well and showed the audience how well he is capable to act. The story does not pick up until half way through the movie. That is when the climax begins and the story begins to take a serious shape compared to the first half. The second hour of the movie has many twists and turns in the sense of the complications between the two main characters. They are caught between their love and their duties and seem to forget how badly they are tangled up in this obstacle. Again the story changes rapidly from a ridiculous comedy into a serious romantic drama. It continues with its more serious side until it hits the end. The ending was not unexpected but without a doubt it can be said that it was a better ending than most recent movies that have been released. For a regular movie person the ending would be predictable, but the overall performance near the end raises and became much better than it was at the beginning of the movie. One has to sit through the movie in order to completely understand what is going on and in order to determine what kind of movie this is. To come to a conclusion and give this movie a definite genre, Moulin Rouge! is a musical love story beyond any doubts, it is preformed in a comedic style as the movie opens, however it changes into a dramatic love story as it proceeds. As a personal note I might add that this movie was no Oscar material accept Ewan McGregor's performance. I believe that with this movie or even his prior movies he has proven that he is a great actor with great abilities. Him being in the cast was probably the only reason that I did watch this movie. As another private note I wish to add that for the 2001 Oscar nominations if there was anyone worthy of winning the `Beat Actor of the Year' award it would have been McGregor rather than Denzel Washington for `Training Day'. This once again proves that the Oscars are not concerned with ART in movies but rather larger box office digits. One last statement that I want to close this off with; this movie is not for everyone, you have to sit through a lot of senseless material in order to get through this and it will not be easy (I warn you now!). As I mentioned it before, if this movie has one strong element to it then it was Ewan McGregor, In other words, McGregor saves this movie from being `very bad' to `okay'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What to think of it ? Moulin Rouge mixes times and cultures with no respect of anything, and it's fun. Seeing the mythic Zidler, Moulin Rouge's owner, singing Madonna's "like a virgin" song to fool a jealous duke, yes, it's fun. Some visual effects are brilliant, really, and Kylie Minogue, in her twenty seconds cameo as a "absynth spirit" is great too. The whole decoration is great too. Now the bad thing : the storyline is simple, but at no moment I wanted to believe in it, I never felt concerned with the love story, Nicole Kidman plays like a fish : wet big eyes but a few expressivity (maybe not her fault : the role is not very well written). The camera does too much slow motions, it makes go sea sick. Sometimes, the camera can't stay showing a still thing more than one second and that is not very enjoyable too. I'm sure this mvie could have been much much better with a real director : Luhrmann has strong visions, good ideas (too much ideas maybe), but he is not a great director for me, I felt exactly the same with Romeo+Juliette. This movie can go in the same box as "le pacte des loups" (brotherhood of the wolves) : funny, better than a waste but far from the masterpiece some calls it.</fullReview>

Stunning to look at, occasionally touching, but overall an empty exercise in film. Kidman should have been nominated for The Others, where she gave a MUCH more subtle, nuanced, and effective performance. Again, Moulin Rouge is not a bad movie, but it could have been and should have been much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did I Really Like This?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I can't stand Baz Luhrmann. From his headache inducing take on "Romeo &amp; Juliet" to his "Everybody Needs Sunscreen" song that was played on the radio every two minutes. The guy has a different view of the world that I never wanted to visit again.My wife finally asked me to rent "Moulin Rouge" because she really wanted to see it, and I refused to see it in theaters. I gave in, and in the first five minutes, I thought I was going to go do something productive with my time, like staring at my shadow, when suddenly I realized I was hooked on this movie.Was it the music? Was it the costumes? Was it the fact that a Jedi Knight was singing? The answer is YES!!!!!!!I took Drama class for six years in school, and I'm telling you right now, I would've loved to do a musical like this in school. Instead we did "Mame"! The first thing people will tell you about this movie is the music. If I were Elton John (which I'm not), I would definitely be proud of the way "Your Song" was arranged. In fact, most of the songs in this movie are just fun to listen to. There is a warning on this, by the way. If you watch this movie &amp; love the music, you'll want to go out and buy the soundtrack. If you want "Lady Marmalade", get soundtrack #1. If you want anything else, soundtrack 2 is for you.Anyway, Moulin Rouge is a lot of fun, but I'll tell you it's extremely bizarre! It's not for everyone. Then again, there are people who don't like "Star Wars".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**POSSIBLE SPOILERS** throughout. I saw this film last year after it reached the second-run movie theater market. Had I paid $7-10 to see it instead of $1, I might be more harsh about what I felt were the movie's shortcomings. As it was, after being absolutely flummoxed by the beginning--(and wondering if I should cut my losses and leave), I stayed to the end and found that I could enjoy many moments of the film. My problem is that after reading many of the reviews on this website--and quite a few on other websites--I find that I can agree with pretty much everything anyone says--(EXCEPT the criticism of Ewan MacGregor's singing. I thought it was marvellous and saved many of the musical numbers.) As for the movie: It was too frenetic. The love story did need time to breathe to have emotional resonance. I too had trouble deciphering whether the director was satirizing romantic musicals or paying tribute to them. That said, I also can agree with those who found it moving and dazzling and fascinating. My feelings about the film fluctuate as much as the camera work. I love opera so you know I can suspend a lot of disbelief, but even I need some emotional sincerity to hang my hat on. The scenes where Satine and Christian are falling in love had that; as did the scenes of the friendship among the "Children of the Revolution" and their creative struggles. The death at the end did not because I did not feel that Nicole Kidman, who did a good job with a"woman as symbol" role, and Ewan Macgregor, who was charming and credible in a role written as more of a type than a flesh and blood person were not allowed uninterrupted, non-gimmicked up screen time to give their scenes emotional richness and space. I think this is one film where I'll always cherish certain scenes from the film, but never end up whole-heartedly loving the entire picture. If the director had toned down his delight with various bags of tricks and avoided the temptation to try have his romance/satire/parody cake and eat it too, this film could have been a classic. Love that ends in heartbreak and death can rarely co-exist with looniness and glitter. I wish more filmakers would remember that. There's nothing wrong with ungilded sentiment. That said, when I see the film again, I'll probably have yet another set of opinions about it. I guess I should just be glad that anyone dares to make a film that isn't so bland that everyone can agree on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I have rented the DVD last weekend and it really sucks bigtime. I hate musical like movies but besides that, the story is told so frustrated. Very fast parts, like in Snatch (but that movie rocks) and irritating parts when they try to convince the Duke. Funny was the music, dated this time, Madonna, Queen etc. while the movie was dated in 1900. The story was a typical lovestory so not very bright though, and I really hate bad endings!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, you either loved this or hated it, and put me in the "hated it!" camp.I truly wanted to love this movie - I really like Nicole Kidman, and certainly she's very beautiful to look at. As are the sets, costumes, etc. But the plot, if there can be said to be one, drags and drags and drags and drags and .... you get the idea.POSSIBLE spoiler - as someone else mentioned, they basically tell you from the beginning the girl's going to die. And then the slower the plot gets, you find yourself yelling at the screen "JUST DIE ALREADY!" And rooting for the romantic lead to get shot. Anything to stop the endless singing about how bloody much they love each other.Guess that makes me quite the cynic. :) But seriously, "Manos, the Hands of Fate" is an action packed thrill ride compared to this slogging swamp of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did I miss something?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't usually comment on movies just to trash them, but the popularity of Moulin Rouge has always baffled me. Besides the later arrivals, the movie seasons of 2000-2002 had been dismal(Jennifer Lopez was up for an Oscar for "The Cell", Julia Roberts actually won an Oscar). I went to see Moulin Rouge because it looked interesting and I liked the actors involved, and, frankly, because there was nothing else to see. Moulin Rouge is a melodramatic, sometimes funny musical. The storyline is sappy, sagging, and cheesy; reminiscent of Gothic literature. Nicole Kidman does a fine job as Satine, but even her genuine emotion can't save this musical from seeming corny. The music is decent, but not heart-wrenching. There are a few appropriate songs (Elton John's "How Wonderful Life Is" is used endearingly), but the most memorable moments come from the comic numbers (See "Like a Virgin"), and the unintentionally comic numbers (See "Roxeanne".) A standout is Jim Broadbent, who is absolutely fantastic as the Moulin Rouge's manager, approaching the performance level set by Joel Grey in "Cabaret". Don't expect a heartbreakingly poignant movie, but if singing star-cross'd lovers guided by fate and fortune are your specialty, you'll be pleased. For everyone else, you can expect to be sufficiently entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Enjoyed Mariah Carey's Glitter more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For my taste "Glitter" was a more satisfying musical. This film seemed very cold which did not sit well with me for watching a love story. Though I was very impressed with the fact that Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor could sing as well as they did, and listening to familiar old love songs incorporated into a new muscial was novel and fun, I could not warm up to the cartoon-like 2 dimensional characters. I found myself visually stimulated by the color and excitement enough to hold my attention to the end, but had no sentiment for the characters nor sympathy for their plight; and nothing really memorable that stuck with me afterwards. It was worth seeing, but the quality of musical talent, the overall attractiveness of the romantic leads both physically and emotionally were more satisfying in the love story "Glitter". Not by any means a flawless film either, but more satisfying in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much editing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are fabulous in this movie and it is well directed. The writing is standard for a musical: nothing great and passable but the choreography is expertly timed and the sets and costumes are lavish. But there is too much editing. Director Baz Luhrmann cuts his film too rapidly. Sure, rhythm is important to a film but his film is cut like an action piece and not a musical. Legendary dancer Fred Astaire would ask his directors to use the editing as little as possible during his dance numbers and the audience absorbed them perfectly. 'Moulin Rouge' is a return to the musical, a genre in movies that never impressed me much because I always felt that they needed to be seen live and that film just contained them too much and put them into a fish bowl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie just in time for Oscar night. After all the hype I was expecting something a little better than this mixed bag. The execution was highly original; unfortunately, all that originality was wasted on the most overdone plot ever invented. Ewan MacGregor was perfect in his role, plus we don't get to see many handsome actors these days. Jim Broadbent as the scary old theater owner was excellent. What falls down is Nicole Kidman's performance. She's slim and exotic, etc. but she's not a strong actress and I feel she relies more on big eyes and good lighting to portray her character. In one excrutiating scene she does a very bad Meg Ryan impression that turned me off her character for the rest of the movie. Another weak point is the duke, who is portrayed comically as a sadsack cuckold, constantly having the wool pulled over his eyes as the two lovers go at it under his nose, but yet the whole plot hinges on the others' fear of him. It doesn't work. The story was a good half hour too long. There's Satine trembling and sobbing yet again...we get it. She's sad. The good parts of the movie: the supporting cast, the quick pacing, the high energy of the song and dance numbers, and the juxtaposition of different scenes during the Roxanne emote-fest.  I don't advise against this movie, but I don't strongly recommend it. But if it leads to Ewan MacGregor getting more leading man roles in musicals or romances, then it's done its job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with others who referred to this movie as a "wasted opportunity." The cinematography was beautiful and the idea original, but it was WAY too long and WAY too flawed to keep my interest.The concept is unique; I enjoyed how some of the contemporary songs came to life as lines in the movie, but thought the concept was horribly overdone. I could smell "Like a Virgin" a mile away, and would've turned the movie off altogether if I hadn't invested so much time already. They obviously had talented writers working for this movie. Why not create more original, appropriate, unobnoxious pieces instead? The budget was so lavish and the costumes so beautiful....I just felt like the writing fell short.I also feel that the love story was extremely overrated. I had heard this was one of the best love stories of all time....the kind of love that everyone looks for. Without giving the story away, I just can't agree with this whatsoever. The two lovers barely know each other. Their relationship is totally superficial, and is plagued with self-superiority, jealousy, and misunderstanding. I got the impression that if the drama was put aside, this couple would last about two weeks. It brought me back to high school all over again.But perhaps the biggest flaw, in my opinion, was Ewan McGregor's singing. Dear God, I teach elementary music and my first graders sing better then he does. My knowledge of vocal music is fairly limited...I am by no means a singing snob... but it was extremely obvious that the poor guy has never had a voice lesson in his life. The low notes were fine...but as soon as he started reaching for those high ones every note was SO piercing and so awful. He didn't do anything with them....just belted them out at the top of his lungs and held them there for excruciating periods of time. It was honestly some of the worst on-key singing I have ever heard in my life.There were a few times that I really enjoyed the way the movie seemed to be going. I was never very actively involved in the "love story," but John Leguizamo is hilarious and there were some dramatic climaxes that had my attention. Unfortunately, these all ended in disappointing ways.Ultimately, I enjoyed the fresh concept, brilliant colors, and eccentric use of songs in this movie. Other then that, I was thoroughly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, I'm a major film enthusiast. I watch all types of film from all over the world and I'm usually VERY positive about the films I watch. Even if the film was initially bad, I would still give it a go and find the good parts in the movie. Now, I was quite exited about Moulin Rouge and I've been waiting a long time to go watch it. Now that I finally have, I don't know what to say... I've never actually hated a movie before... This movie was bad, unoriginal, simple and predictable. It's like some sort of psychodelic nightmare of MTV, with a crosscut of all the top hits of the 20th century. Worst of all being them using Nirvana's "Smells like Teen Spirit"... I really like that song, and for this movie to use it because of six words "Here we are now, entertain us" was just too much for me. I've never in my life had a headache from watching a movie. But this movie almost gave me a migrane. I strained my brain to see the positive in it. I came up with one thing. The credits.

		<fullReview>After loving Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliet, I was very excited about watching Moulin Rouge. My disappointment was overwhelming. It never lived up to its first 10 minutes which I did think were great fun. The problem with this film is the tedious love story. It was hard to care about these two when so much more fun could be had at the Moulin Rouge. Where was the decadence? The fun? It was so morose and self pitying. It might have been saved if they had picked two actors who could actually sing and given them some decent songs. Yes, it looked spectacular but that only added to my disappointment - a wasted opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is visually stunning. I loved the little green fairy. As for the rest of this film. Well I expected an old fashion romance. The storyline is not supposed to be unique. But if the script had been written differently and *SPOILER* they hadn't said Satine is dead in the first 5 minutes.*end SPOILER* And hadn't used MTV style editing, it wouldn't have been as annoying. The music could have orignal!!!!!! If the music had been orignal and done at a different pace, I would have probably fallen head over heals for this movie.But instead their idea of a musical:Lets reuse cliche' songs like Diamonds are a girls Best Friend (twice no less). Like virgin and slap them in some sort of order and tell a love story. Now I did like the story that they was trying to tell, it was simple and a little Disney like, I call this movie a Dirty Disney film. But it could have been so much more.But the fact that this piece of weirdness is getting nominated for Oscars, simply blows my mind (although for art direction and cinematography it deserves it all out). I will admit Baz was trying hard to make something different, and that I applaud him for it. I would much rather film makers try to make something different visually. Film is visual art and more film makers NEED to take advantage of that....I'm sick of seeing films that all visually look the same, the large amounts of rehash films like A Beautiful Mind. Even if the movie has a cliche storyline at least make a good script and the visuals interesting (best example Amelie). But with the visual style I want a little more meat with it. Thats almost impossible to come by in hollywood.All in all, I'd say go see it, for the what the heck effect. You might love it, hate it and want to poke your eyes out, confused by it, turned off by it, laugh at it's slap stickiness. Whatever the case, watch it once it won't hurt to bad,I think....6/10</fullReview>

I appreciated the joke of using late 20th century popular tunes in a movie set in 1900. The two principal actors (Nicole and Ewan) sing amazingly well.What I did not like: First of all the story. Was this the one-millionth love story? Will he get her, will she get him? Who cares? This type of story has been told so often in books and movies. Then the over-acting: the Duke and the Moulin Rouge's director over-acted heavily, making their scenes unrealistic. The other actors over-acted a bit too. Maybe the over-acting was intentional - it fits the type of acting that was practiced around 1900. Still I don't like it.Overall a 6.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

The musical sequences (and there are many) play right to the MTV music video generation including many popular songs from the last 20 years sung by the characters. The editing, though, jars the viewer to the point of eye soreness. The story revolves around a writer (Ewan McGregor) and a performer (Nicole Kidman) who fall in love despite a few obstacles. The acting is very good, but this musical just feels a little too stylish and never lets you fully into its fantasy world. A 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

As a love story by itself, it is strictly according to the formula of tragic love. The way it is presented, however, raises it to a higher level. The sets and costumes were visually stunning, and the staccato presentation of the scenes added to the pleasure. The use of mid to late twentieth century music in a story ostensibly set in 1899 only added to the film's appeal. I highly recommend this picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a weird movie. It's like `The Wizard of OZ' on drugs. Baz Luhrmann, co-writer and director, and Craig Pearce, co-writer, have created an utterly, decadent fantasy that pushes the envelope of the imagination. This movie is a testament that there are no boundaries when making a movie these days. The computer-generated images of the Moulin Rouge and Paris in 1900 are fascinating. The camera shots that seem to have no seams, zoom through the city, and come to a close-up of an actor are great. However, I can't say I enjoyed `Moulin Rouge' that much. It just seemed way too busy, and it could have been better without all of the silliness. The love story that is central in the plot, was, in fact, interesting and touching, but unfortunately there are too many campy distractions. While watching `Moulin Rouge', it reminded me of a couple of movies. The first that I thought of was 1996's `Romeo + Juliet'. I later found out found that he co-wrote and directed it as well. The second I thought of was the Beatles' `Help' because of the playfulness and zaniness of some of the scenes. So if you liked the style of `Romeo + Juliet', you may enjoy `Moulin Rouge'. The music and songs were good and bad at times. Luhrmann and Pearce take famous songs and blend them to create some interesting medleys. Many artists are sampled, from Nirvana to Dolly Parton. Madonna, the Beatles, and Elton John also have large chunks of songs thrown in. The combinations are not always great but are original. My favorite scene in the movie is when Christian (Ewan McGregor) is trying to convince Satine (Nicole Kidman) that they should be lovers. Christian and Satine sing lyrics from famous love songs, while they are in on top of her elephant-shaped apartment (yes, she lives in an elephant). They end up singing David Bowie's "Heroes" (great song).McGregor is outstanding, as the aptly named, Christian; the poet who falls in love with the most sought after prostitute at the Moulin Rouge. His singing voice is good, and he handled his dramatic scenes very well. Kidman is Satine; the hooker that falls for the poet and suddenly develops morals (the hooker with the heart of gold). I have never liked Kidman, and I have a hard time believing that Satine was the most popular prostitute. I don't see it. She does sing well, however. If you are a fan, you should like this new dimension of her.The best performance in the film was by Jim Broadbent, as Harold Zidler, the owner and ?pimp' of the Moulin Rouge. He was great. He reminded me of the wizard in the "Wizard of OZ". He was funny and he sang well. The bottom line is that I am glad I saw this movie, however the craziness and silliness was taken too far for my tastes. I wish Luhrmann had made a more serious movie that was consistent with the love story. I can, however, appreciate the creativity and work that went into this movie; it is quite an accomplishment. I think if you are a fan of Broadway musicals, you should like it. 6 out of 10</fullReview>

For me, it was one of the greatest cinematic experiences I've ever had.Never before have I seen a film which makes such a brilliant and imaginative use of colour. This film, along with Baz Luhrmann's other two films(Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliet)practically eat colour.This film has everything. It has comedy, drama, thrills and tragedy. But it is the music that makes this picture truly special. There is one particular scene which deserves special praise and that has to be the rendition of Madonna's Like a Virgin,which is both amusing and funny.This film fully deserves its Oscar nominations.

		<fullReview>This film has to be one of the most amazing, ambitious and beautiful films ever made. It captures the essence of a Red Curtain Production, and splashes it onto screen in dazzling, jaw-dropping fashion. The actor's talents and hard work is seen easily in this film, and director Baz Luhrmann has proved to be one of the most influential and creative filmmakers of his generation. Someone with so much vision could easily be called a genius, and it is disheartening to see that he was not nominated for "Best Director" by the Academy. If you have not seen this film already in theatres (which you have surely missed out), I cannot recommend it more for rental. The actors, director, everyone involved pulls you into the vivacious and vibrant world that is the Moulin Rouge, and makes the viewer never want to leave it. If the performance aspect is not quite fulfilling to one, the technical views should astonish some, with gutsy editing and the best costume, set and art direction I have seen to date. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(I saw this on DVD, YMMV)I haven't seen Luhrmann's other big film, Romeo+Juliet, nor did I know anything about the film when I rented it. All I had heard is that it was a musical, a bit odd, and nominated for some Oscars.Christian is a writer who gets drafted to write a play called Spectacular, Spectacular! when Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (who is an actor, not a painter in this film) crashes through the ceiling with another actor practicing in the upstairs flat. Once the idea for the play is begun, the group of actors visit the Moulin Rouge to sell the play to the owner, Harold Zidler. There they meet Satine, a young dancer and prostitute that dreams of becoming a "real" actress someday. Here chance appears when the Duke of Monroth offers to finance Spectacular, Spectacular in return for Satine's services.The hook here is this movie is a musical. Not a typical musical, the songs here take lines and melodies from many different songs to create new ideas. The two pieces that stand out were the opening intro of the Moulin Rouge with the intro of Satine and the actors as they were waiting for Satine to save the play by acting her part for the Duke.The first had the women of the Moulin Rouge singing various lines from overtly sexual songs, with the men singing "here we are now, entertain us" from Nirvana. Ripped clean from it's cynical, ironic underpinnings, the line creates something totally new - call it the John's Anthem.The second had Christian singing a song of love and jealousy while the actors danced the life of a prostitute to "Roxanne" sung in a low growl.As I watched, I was increasingly impressed with the technique and with the ability of Kidman and McGregor to not get lost in all the music, color, and quick cuts. It was only at the end that I could look back and realize I had seen a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming and brilliant Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is quite a film to behold. It's a technically stunning achievement that really gives you more than you really deserve. It's not only a brilliant musical but a really tender love story that is uplifting and tragic. Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor are amazing as the hopeless romantics and John Leuizamo is really funny as the Ewan Mcgregor's friend and sidekick. The Directing by Baz Luhrmann is great, and the cinematography by John O'Connell is breathtaking. If you want to put a smile on your face, Moulin Rouge is the movie to put it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Rouge: The greatest movie I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well what can I say? Baz Luhrmann has yet again created a masterpiece. Moulin Rouge combines immaculate settings, a charming storyline, glorious actors and marvellous lyrics to come together to form the film Moulin Rouge! Nicole and Ewan sure put on a very entertaining show. Their singing was magical along with their extraordinary acting performances. They both deserve many awards!! It's not very often a movie such as this comes along. A movie that can be watched over and over again and yet still entangles the viewer into hilarious comedy, spine-tingling drama and tear jerking tragedy. All in all this movie is one of a kind. If you haven't yet seen this movie/musical get out there, buy the DVD/video and watch it! You won't be disappointed. I know I wasn't!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three days after standing on Place de Figalle in front of 'le Moulin Rouge' (and bought some of Lautrec's posters as a souvenir), I decided to go and see the movie. Moulin Rouge! turned out 2 B plain and cliche entertainment. I guess that's what it's supposed 2 B and should be treated like that. It was a disappointment in general with some good moments and dynamic cinematography. The point is that it was flat but musical world with round bellies and lots of booze: Burgundian, flamboyant, bohemian, cancan and tragic. Tragic because the actors didn't have the chance to give the love story (which could have been good) sense.'Smells like teen spirit' (Nirvana), 'Your Song' (Elton John), 'Heroes' (David Bowie), 'One day I'll fly away', 'Roxanne' (Sting) and the inevitable 'The show must go on' (Queen) are examples of the arrangements for the score. The original songs once are great, but the rest of the movie didn't do much for me. I can understand the nostalghic feelings for those songs, but that doesn't really contribute to a great movie: it merely sets a firm tone and provides convenient dialogue from songtexts.The exclamation mark should have been removed from the title and especially from the movie itself if you take my meaning. Neither being a fan of Kidman and McGregor nor of musicals in general, I still say that Kidman and the cinematography deserve 2 B nominated, but no winners as far as I'm concerned. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...with MOULIN ROUGE! I'll start by making a bold statement: this is one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen! Everything about this movie is superb: acting, direction, style, music, etc.!Baz Luhrmann has really outdone himself this time! With this movie, he shows what you REALLY can do a movie camera. He's not like most other directors: he's original and interesting.Nicole Kidman gives one of the most dynamic performances of the year as 'Satine', a dazzling and mysterious courtesan/nightclub performer! Not only does she display a full range of emotions, but she also unleashes a glorious singing voice! Who knew she was a singer??!!Ewan McGregor is just as wonderful as Christian, a struggling young writer who falls in love with Satine. McGregor is a great actor and can do just about anything! He also sings very well... and does a fine job with the Elton John classic, 'Your Song'.John Leguizamo and Jim Broadbent also shine in supporting roles.If you have seen this movie, and liked it, then please purchase the soundtrack! Kidman and McGregor's soaring rendition of 'Come What May' and the Christina Aguilera/Pink/Mya/Li'l Kim pop hit 'Lady Marmalade' are entertaining highlights!If you have NOT seen this movie (for some strange reason...), I strongly suggest that you do. But when you see it for the first time, it is recommended that you view it without any distractions whatsoever. I guarantee that you'll love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a `Cabaret' for the twenty-first century but without the original songs. Instead it builds on the work of other genius -- which leaves it somewhat hollow at the core. There is a great deal of genius -- here but it is borrowed genius: It is in the art direction, musical direction, lightening fast editing and the overall vision of director Baz Luhrmann. This film borrows from every known source: paintings, cartoons, with `Camille,' Satyricon,' and `Streetcar Named Desire' to name just a few of the film sources. Musically it is stunning. But even more stunning is how other people's music is used to tell this story -- a story originally told by Alexandre Dumas. The choreography is amazing; particularly the routine set to Sting's ?Roxanne.' It is jaw dropping.John Lequizamo, as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, (especially when dressed as the ?sitar that could only tell the truth') is a brilliant piece of character acting.Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor do their own singing and they do it admirably.Everything is simplified: The Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh) is evil. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is good and Nicole Kidman is the woman of easy virtue. It could hardly be more basic.The sets, costumes, makeup and overall visual feel of the film were outstanding. But there could be so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let me say that I am Australian, love Australian movies, and admire the daring, new and exciting.Moulin Rouge delivers on some levels: The costuming is sumptuous There are witty gags through the music (especially loved the Like a Virgin scene) The acting is generally quite good Nicole Kidman is perfect for the role (I usually am not a fan of Nicole...)BUTI thought that the avant garde film making was hampered by a thin plot and weak dialogue. Come on, people, any film with the line, "You MUST sleep with the Duke" lacks sophistication. The underlying love story, though sweet, was very run-of-the-mill and seemed to be incidental to the theatrics.Moulin Rouge has made a stir, but I suspect that it will become one of those films that people forget as newer and better films come along. To give it credit, it has broken new ground - but I thought Madonna and 'Evita' was more sophisticated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I walked out of the theater after seeing Moulin Rouge for the first time I was speechless. It took days for all I had just seen to sink in. I saw it two more times in the theaters and walked away always craving more. This film just "woke me up" so to speak and rejuvenated my spirits which were crushed by the mass-produced monotonous films of the season.Baz Luhrmann is a visual genius. He decided that he was going to spend millions of dollars making a lavish, all out, decadent, artistic musical experience. He could have spent this money making the next hallow Schwarzenegger film, but instead he decided to go out on a limb and a masterpiece was the final product.Some people have argued that this film merely shows glitz and glamour over substance, but I disagree. As he did with his version of Romeo and Juliet, Luhrmann has a way of using visual brilliance and music to convey emotions that could never be done with conventional filmmaking. The extraordinary artists, designers, and editors are the stars of the film, but the performers, especially Kidman, McGregor, and Broadbent steal the show.The songs are incredible too. Only Luhrmann could combine Nirvana, Queen, Elton John and other pop figures into one giant montage of artistic vision. It feels as though the songs were written for the movie, as they work perfectly with each scene, and the stars can sing beautifully too!This film is a work of love. It is obvious that everyone who was involved with the picture took it to heart. The story I'll admit is not original - in fact it's very similar to Romeo and Juliet, a story which has been beaten to the ground at this point. But the film is still very original as it takes the feelings and emotions of love and splashes them across the screen in every scene. In the first half of the film we see the mystical world of Bohemia through the eyes of Christian who is in love. Much like in Romeo and Juliet, during the second half the mood changes leading up to an emotional climax.However, it is when he is in love that Bohemia sparkles, showing how love can change everything. This film is essentially a tribute to the power of love to change one's world.I suggest that you watch this film with an open mind and an open heart, and just let yourself fall into this irrational glittering world of Bohemia during the "summer of love." You too will fall in love with Luhrmann's style, trust me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spunky, beautiful "sister" to Romeo + Juliet '96</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd been a HUGE fan of Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet in 1996 but did not think to see this movie until it grabbed the attention of the Academy and Golden Globes. I suppose being used to his style made it easier for me to fall in love with the film, viewers seem to either love it fiercely or hate it with a passion.As others have mentioned, the story is simple yet touching. The score is amazingly blended into the film's musical numbers and it's nearly impossible not to find yourself singing along in your repeat viewings. Watch out for Ewan McGregor's sudden outbursts of song, they're beautiful and breathtaking. He plays his role exceptionally well, his face perfectly capturing that of the innocent man untouched by the cruel machinations of Love. I was *very* surprised with his singing ability.Nicole Kidman is even better. I was shocked at how stunningly beautiful she is. I could have lived with fewer poodle yips from her, but other than that I thought she was amazing, I now have a new favorite for Best Actress when March 24 comes around! Next time I'm at Amazon, I will be sure to buy this, I have a feeling I won't get tired of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>one important unanswered question, "What the hell did I just watch!?" This is one of the most disturbing movies of all time yet everyone seems to love it. I wonder how much in royalties the creators had to pay to use all those songs they "borrowed". They combine Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit", Lady Marmalade, the Can Can song, and some hideous rap song to create the most disturbing and freakish opening musical number ever. I was severely disappointed in this "Oscar Worthy" film. To end on a better note Ewan McGregor was the only thing that made this film worthy of a star. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!!!</fullReview>

The music was the best part of the whole thing.It was also pretty depressing whenever you thought about the actual plot, and it never really pulled out of that. I don't go to the movies to be depressed.Nicole Kidman was great - in fact the acting was fabulous all around, but I never could get fully into it. Kinda boring for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exciting Tour Through 20th Century Music!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We start off with a relatively ambiguous musical reference to "The Sound of Music" and the tour de force of music only progresses from there. This postmodern masterpiece unlike anything yet envisioned is a gem that should and will be revered for ages to come. If you have an interest in music this film will not disappoint. Forget the plot, it is insignificant anyway. Focus on the music!!! I guarantee you will leave humming the music on your way to purchasing the soundtrack. The music is threaded together with constant references to Orpheus in the Underworld, especially the can-can portion. As well Ewan and Nicole put a new light to individual songs as they cover them throughout the "narrative". I cannot describe it as that would give away to many songs, and that is the fun of the film, identifying the dozens of musical references embedded in the movie. I must say, to end, if you go into watching it thinking of it as a fun, comedic experience you will love it. However, if you are a serious person, without a sense of humor you will hate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliance and Beauty behind Insanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This story is about love...the woman I loved is.....dead." That's one of the first lines of this film, and sets the tone better than you could imagine. You might think it sets you up for a depressing ride...ha. You either love it or hate it, I've never met anyone in the middle.This is a better movie than I imagined. It sells itself as a colorful melodrama, but it's a musical through and through. It's officially a TragiComiDramaMusical, or that's what the critics call it, but it gets to your heartstrings and senses and kicks them - violently.Baz Luhrmann had a theory for this film, that music and razzle dazzle and color will create a heightened experience, and it worked. People may pay more attention to it for it's astounding technical abilities. But then I was mainly captivated by it's music, acting, and it's storyline. Not to say I didn't like the color and razor sharp editing (Jill Bilcock is quite amazing), quite the contrary. I was purely amazed at what they achieved. But that they could go over that and send a clear cut and emotional story with superb acting, is something you rarely see in any "super charged" films. It's chock full of allegories, symbolism, etc, of which we rarely see anymore, and there are many layered stories occurring at once. Luhrmann hand groomed it all to make it work at it's full potential, and it's varying degrees of beauty will hit you if you really pay attention. This is not a film to be watched partly, you have to pay full attention or you won't get it.The story is loosely based on the Greek Tragedy about Orhpeus and Dumas'fils "Camille". It revolves around the young Christian (Ewan McGregor) who enters the world of the Moulin Rouge and Montmarte to become a great writer. He befriends some strange Bohemians and is assigned to write a show for the MR called "Spectacular! Spectacular!". He has to recruit the courtesan Satine, but falls in love with her. Eventually they both become enmeshed in their love for each other, the dirty and treacherous goings on of the MR, and the making of the show. After betrayal and intrigue, the film ends with a tragic ending you knew was coming from Christian's first penetrating line: "This story is about love...the woman I loved is.....dead."The acting is much better than I expected. People had been talking about how Kidman could get a Oscar nomination for her performance in this (which she did), but I had thought "Why? It's a musical. There's no such thing as good acting in musicals." Nicole shines. She goes through several stages in the film and is always believable at the level she chooses. Especially in her TB scenes, where she plays sick, she does a very unglamorous and ugly portrayal of the disease. She does comedy and seduction and heroism in one role subtly, and it's not at all cliche. McGregor particularly surprised me. I had known he was a good actor, he too goes through stages, and pulls it off with his ability to act completly natural in a weird role. It's hard to act "innocent" without getting terribly annoying, and he's not, but maybe because he's more of a decent and noble character than the stereotypical "innocent" (compared to Dumas' Armand, he's far nobler, he doesn't sink to depravity whereas Armand did). Supporting characters shine, and John Leguizamo deserves a thumbs up for a particularly painful but strong performance (if you hear how they shortened him). Jim Broadbent, who plays the enabling and sweet pimp Zidler (that's what he is), is fantastic, and Richard Roxborough who plays the Duke is notorious and does a wonderful job at being completely and one hundred percent devious.This movie shines, and it addicts you. Many people have said you either love it or you hate it, and I'd say it's true, I've never met someone who was lukewarm about it. It will either overwhelm you or you'll find it ridiculous, or you'll like it for all it is. It's supposed to be overboard. It's supposed to have that "If it exists we'll use it just because." That's the whole point. It's a beautiful film, and it's very true in it's story, it follows how life works. There are people who'll be bad to you, and people who will love you, and not everything works as you want it and death is a much stronger force than an ideal. It's supposed to be an experience, not just a date at the movies. © written by Mercy Bell</fullReview>

Maybe that's another reason some people don'tunderstand Moulin Rouge! - because what is presented on their TV screenis a) shrunken down b) does not fully show the great detail that wentinto this film. Even if its the widescreen version, can you honestlymake out the hats that go up at the end of Rhythm of the Night??? Doyourself a favor if you feel that you just can't stand this movie: sitthrough it just once without any distractions - I guarentee you'll findsomething you like.

		<fullReview>I can't remember much of my first viewing of this film - only that I was dead to the world outside of "Moulin Rouge", had some kind of goofy smile plastered on my face all the way through and that my head was reeling by the end. I had come, after steeling myself for disappointment, to be pleasantly surprised and moved - not by the plot or acting, it must be admitted, but by the sheer visual impact of the film and the evident enthusiasm with which it was made. It's a gutsy production, and I admired baz for taking it on. It was not until later viewings (when I finally had room in my brain to process something other than the intoxicating sets, costumes and songs) that I began to appreciate the acting and the plot. Kidman's performance, in particular, had left me strangely cold after the first viewing, while I found McGregor adorable in the wide-eyed innocent role. It is only later, when I finally became familiar with the character of Satine, that I realised Kidman actually turns out a better, more delicate and subtle performance than McGregor. Her character is far more complex and underneath the surface, far more intense, and must have been a greater challenge. Satine is Christian's first love - he will eventually move on. But for Satine, more world-weary, Christian is her first, last, and only chance at living a life with love. All her emotion is invested in this relationship - it is her key to freedom. So, while the plot is simple, classic (and on first viewing appears cliched), it is still a powerful story, pulled off by some pretty decent performances from its actors. After watching the film a few times, you realise that a more complex or even more unfamiliar plot would have made the whole thing into a REAL mess - it would have been too much to juggle and sustain along with all the stylistic elements which, let's face it, make the movie. 1(for plot) +3 (for acting) +5 (for creativity and courage to try something fresh and original)= 9/10</fullReview>

I was extremely pleased by the talent revelation of both Kidman &amp; Mc Gregor. Nicole, has been full of surprises this year but this is a miracle. The blend of old and new songs with the legend of Molin Rouge was exceptional with the 'Like a Virgin' topping the show as it was performed by MEN????!!! I will class this as a rare sample of fine cinema, and will dare to compare it with other masters of the kind like Evita and Grease. The addition of a tragic ending 'amour', has given the film a touch of 'Love Story', with Ryan O'Neal and Ali Mc Graw.There's only one verdict. Get it and treasure it. 15/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie excels at what it intends to do... it's la boheme spirit in it's funniest form. Surely, the story line is predictable... but then, it was never supposed to be surprising (Christian tells you in the setup how the story will end...), so, instead of predictable, the appropriate term should be 'classic' - I would not go so far as to call it Shakespearan, though. It has so many references, grand musical performances, dazzling visuals and great camera work that it at least qualifies as number one musical I have seen so far... because it is essentially light-hearted. I am a huge fan of production values, after all, that's what makes most of a movie truly appealing, and Moulin Rouge had it all. The set design was great, the acting very solid, the singing surprisingly good, the direction flawless, the camera work dazzling, the FX fun, the dancing intriguing. It surely is not the most important movie of the century, but if you are willingly to let it pick you up and be carried away by it, this movie will make you want to see it again and again... Conclusion: Spectacular Spectacular, straight A for production values, worth the DVD buy anytime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge! with the exclamation mark. phew!! what an experince. i finally saw the movie, expecting to hate it. i was expecting a hollywood version of a bollywood song, dance masala pot-boiler. was i ever wrong.the movie is clever. it is funny. it is amusing and it is full of little clever touches that is an absolute delight for any trivia lover. baz luhrmann has delivered a very clever version of a highly cliched, trite and stupid base plot.there is so much to admire about the movie. sure, the colour and style are a revelation for a hollywood movie. but for someone exposed to a lot of bollywood it is nothing great. i also particularly like the indian touches. quit funny really :)i say, how can anyone not like a movie that has a broadway version of smells like teen spirit?? how can you not love the big trip on lautrec??!!?? madonna, the beatles, freddy mercury. nobody is spared. everyone is included in this joyride. oh!! and the hills are alive with the sound of music??? :)) kylie minogue as the green fairy??? what a madcap rollercoaster movie!!! i loved it.if it werent for the fact extremely stupid and boring main plot. this would have earned a perfect 10. points docked for that. go ahead and watch this stylish fun caper anyway!!a rollercoaster 9!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that this is not my kind of movie. It seemed to be inventive and fast moving and had lots of nice songs but I guess I was wanting a little more story and less extravaganza. Jim Broadbent, Ewan McGregor and John Leguizamo were very good. I must admit another bias, I cannot stand Nicole Kidman. I think her acting is egocentric hamming. I think she was miscast and the movie suffered because of her. Other problems were too quick MTVish shots and the penchant of the cast to yell their lines. It was a bold movie clearly taking a chance with an odd way of telling the story and was, my biases aside, successful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can, if I squint REAL hard, maybe, just maybe, see why people like this film. This is one of those movies where your eyes are frantically searching for something to hold onto, but just can't find the ground. Besides the visuals, the plot was also dry wall. The love emotion deep inside I felt was the tickling of my gag reflex. This movie is not for the faint of heart, nor should it be for anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Keeping my lack of historical perspective in mind (in that I must consider the present to be the most important part of history) this is potentially the most important movie of all time, if its message is followed. Sadly, it will very likely end up as one of the last champions of life and love before the wave of mediocrity crashes over the world and drowns these gems of true movie-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! This film gets better every time I see it. I think women will like this movie more than men. You certainly have to appreciate music to really enjoy this film. I for one was amazed when I realized both Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor sang their own songs. Much to my surprise, they EXCELLED at it! Kidman sizzles as Satine! MacGregor additionally is a Huge talent(ha ha) and shouldn't be overlooked. His voice dazzles me. I love Ewan's character Christian and his "anything is possible with love" approach! Nicole does a marvelous job with transforming Satine from a call girl to a woman in love after Christian sings "Your Song" to her. Her entire demeanor changes after this and from that point on I am hooked! This scene is very funny as she tries to hide Christian from The Duke. Baz Luhrmann does a fantastic job with this movie! This movie will make you laugh and cry. I recommend watching this movie more than once as I notice something new every time. I have to tell you that this is one of the most entertaining movies that I have seen in awhile. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am going to compare `Moulin Rouge' with `Shakespeare In Love' because both of the movies are about a struggling young man and a stunning(and stunningly skinny) beauty sought by a wealthy and callous other man. Both movies are about the love between a writer and a performer within a play. And both movies represent young love with physical passion and sexy young stars. I admit, the movies cannot be compared in movie making ability, because the styles are so different (MR is more creative visually and stylistically, but SIL is more creative with language, and incorporating-and changing history), but they can be compared on their representations of love. SIL actually is better at showing true love than MR. SIL's love affair makes MR's look like over-dramatic puppy love.First, the scenes between Christian and Satine in MR don't display as much love on a intellectual-as well as physical level-as the scenes between Viola and Shakespeare. Viola's intellect is comparable to Shakespeare's. Viola is actually more realistic than Shakespeare. She realizes-before him-that she can cherish what she has with Shakespeare forever, but must marry Wessex in order to allow Shakespeare to continue to create what they both love-plays. Indeed, their love is based on a greater love. In MR, Christian seems somewhat educated, but Satine doesn't even realize that coughing up blood means you are going to die-especially without treatment. Not that Viola and Shakespeare give the impression of intertwined souls, but Christian and Satine just seemed like merely horn dogs who substitute dramatic posturing for love and still think it's the same thing. Viola and Shakespeare really cared about the play they were creating; they truly wanted to create something together that other people would truly care about. Christian and Satine created a half-baked play to bolster Satine's career and protect their affair from the duke's immense `intellect.' Both Christian and Shakespeare were on deadlines but Shakespeare actually cared what he was writing about.I guess one could argue that Christian and Satine shared a love for the Moulin Rouge, since they were only shown to love another within the vicinity of the Moulin Rouge. But that means that Viola and Shakespeare's love was even more varied. They not only love each other in the playhouse and Viola's bedroom, but outside a church and beside a river. They did not need a certain surrounding to support their love. Shakespeare didn't care if Viola looked like a woman when he kissed her either. That either shows true love-or Shakespeare was really horny or kinky or both.Another argument is that love cannot include jealousy. The Bible does mention that love is not envious. Shakespeare is never jealous when Viola is involved. (He is only jealous of Marlowe.) He knows she loves him and not Wessex. What says more about love than when a person trusts the person they love enough not to be jealous? In MR though, Christian gets jealous of the Duke because he doesn't trust Satine's love for him. (Which is incredibly stupid of him because why would Satine even like a dolt like the Duke? Maybe Christian and Satine are an intellectual match after all.)Another thing-Viola wanted to act because she loved it. She didn't even care about the recognition because she acted under the name of Thomas Kent. Satine on the other hand, wanted to act to be a `star.' Which character shows more true love and passion? (This argument assumes people think passion for oneself is not as noble as passion for creativity and other people.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have not seen this movie, go now! I saw it here in Holland four times. Finally a movie musical that isn't stupid or boring. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor are perfect together. The songs are very creative and great. The editing sweeps you into the movie. There is nothing bad I can say about this film. Just go see it or rent the dvd in stores. I think Nicole should win Oscar for this role. Tom Cruise can go cry over loosing her because Nicole is so much beter than Penelope. This is Nicole's best role and one of the best movies in the last ten years. Baz give us more, more, more! Ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>--warning: possible spoilers-- I'd have to say, that before I saw this movie I wasn't much for musicals. But the modern day techno/ pop style just added to the greatness of this dazzling, romantic film. I have nothing but praise for Aussie Director (go the Aussies!) Baz Luhrmann. This movie was not only romantic, beautiful, sad, and fun, but one of a kind. The acting was excellent, particularly by Richard Roxburgh and Nicole Kidman (also both Aussies). In closing I have to say that I love this movie and I hope it is nominated for best picture at this years Oscars. This critically acclaimed masterpiece is a must see for anyone. Even if you don't like musicals, you'll love this one!9 ? out of 10 for Moulin Rouge!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched Moulin Rouge for the fourth time. I am more amazed each time I see it...each time I hear the soundtrack. I am a photographer so light, color, and their combinations fascinate me. As I viewed the film the first time...I was blown away at the introduction to the Moulin Rouge....the smearing,swirling of color...the quick cut editing...the wild music and bacchanalian fever of the sequence made me feel as if I was walking through there myself...that scene...with the Lady Marmalade song by the "ladies" and the rich men entering with Smells like Teen Spirit....sold me then and there regardless of having to get over my dislike of all things Kidman...after my third viewing she had won me over as well. Try as I might I cannot picture anyone else in the role. The Roxanne number was so perfect to the mood of the story at the moment and what better way in which to tell it but the over the top tango...at once violent...sensual...dramatic....and true to the storyline at the moment I have a weakness for the romantic movie but am also a movie snob and this film filled both bills for me.Congrats to Mr. Luhrmann.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I own the DVD set of this movie, and it is an addition to my growing collection I will never regret. It took me twice to the theatre to really understand this movie...but I came out loving it both times, the second time I just loved it more. It is not exactly what I would classify as a spectacular movie musical...for that you have to back to the classics, but it has an undeniable appeal all it's own. I have heard a lot of people say to me that this movie plays like a music video, that the songs are fit oddly into the story and many other things. But, after years of seeing musicals and being in them, I have to wonder if there is a single musical out there that doesn't have people randomly bursting into song at odd times (see the Gotta Dance number in Singing in the Rain if you don't believe me). This movie is not meant to be logical, it's meant to be a moving, dazzling, tantalizing appeal to all the senses, and in that it succeeds remarkably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard about Moulin Rouge for the first time I wasn't really planning on watching it. I'm not a big fan of musicals but when I saw the film, I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Moulin Rouge was a very entertaining feature and I enjoyed every bit of it. Perhaps the length of the film could have been shortened. Luhrmann has done a great job in combining a story set in 1900 with a modern soundtrack. Full marks to Nicole Kidman on a good performance. She has had a good year as far as films are concerned with 'The Others' also being critically appreciated. She is also a surprisingly good singer, and so is Ewan McGregor! A must-watch for any musical film fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can I say in one line that will summarise this masterpiece?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Q. What's Moulin Rouge all about, then?A.It's about a young English poet named Christian (Ewan McGregor, whose performance has been highly under-rated) who travels to Paris in 1899, despite his father's disapproval. He becomes acquainted with Henri Toulouse-Laudrec (John Leguizamo), a disorientated Argentinean (Jacek Koman), and several others. Well, they fall through his roof anyway. When they discover he is a writer, they want him to write a play, then get it staged in La Mouline Rouge (Translates as "The Red Windmill")"The Nightclub of Your Dreams!" It is there he first sees Satine (Nicole Kidman) a beautiful, ahem, courtesan. They meet, fall in love, sing and dance...but all is not well. The Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh) is determined to take Satine away from the Moulin Rouge and make her a star (and, it seems, his wife). But then Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent) our nightclub's manager, discovers that our Satine is not very well... This is a beautiful film. (C'est Magnifique!)Anyone who says this is just like all the other films titled 'Moulin Rouge' (the flops from the 30's and 40's,) either cannot appreciate good things, or is lying. Running at just over 2 hours, some would say it's a little long, but it flies by with the help of some speedy cameras and beautiful performances. With some help from a few familiar songs (Heroes by David Bowie, Material Girl by Madonna, and Your Song by Sir Elton John, to name a few) and obvious hard work, Baz Luhramann has created the best musical since Grease. (C'mon, admit it, we all sang Summer Nights at one point) All the stars positively sparkle and there is strong chemistry between them all. There are times when you laugh (When Zidler sings a famous Madonna reel to the Duke) times when you cry (The tragedy off-stage about ten minutes before the end, I'm not gonna spoil it for the minority who haven't seen it) and times when you can only sit on the edge of your seat to see what happens (yeah, like I'm going to tell you when that is! ). It'll be a few months before the launch of Moulin Rouge on DVD over here, but if you're in a similar situation, it's totally worth waiting for. Someone asked me why the actors in this were so great. Y'know what I said?`BECAUSE THEY CAN CAN-CAN!' (Sorry for the bad joke.)Stacy_G_IE</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so wonderful. The scenes were breaktaking and reminded me of dreams that I used to have as a child. The songs were far better than I had anticipated. I feel that Nicole Kidman completely delivered the goods in the wonderful musical about what this normal man played by Ewan will do to prove his love to Nichole. What else can I say? The movie was without a doubt the best musical I have seen since Jesus Christ Superstar. The way they used songs from Madonna and U2 were simply magical. I hope that in the future more movies are like this. There are simply NOT ENOUGH musicals anymore. I will never forget the feelings that watching THE MOULIN ROUGE! brought fourth in me.

A story of Love, Freedom, Beauty, Truth, yes without being corny. Those themes, the most powerful in humanistic tradition, come alive in Moulin Rouge. Thank you!It has music, not just music in the usual sense but music from our era put into the period of the movie, circa 1890 and it was made to work wonderfully. Imagine Nirvana, in Gay Paree! The new music fit in the old setting because their themes are the same: dancing, sex, exuberance, gettin' it on!Moulin Rouge has the mose beautiful, luscious woman in Nicole Kidman; my God what a photogenic set of eyes: hypnotic, teasing, deep, flirtatious. She was deep in Eyes Wide Shut too. This girl has it down to her heels: passion and knowledge. She made a believer out of me, I'll tell you.This movie has color, presented by a most talented cinematographer and lighting director; it's perfect. It jumps off the screen at you. It caresses you, pulls you through the film like an opiate, increasing your pleasure with each frame. More!I was so happy I saw Moulin Rouge! I love Moulin Rouge!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is a tapestry of things borrowed and thrown together to produce some great fun. The film is a little bit Magic Flute, a little bit MTV, a little bit Cabaret and a little bit Monty Python.Moulin Rouge is giddy fun, right from the first scene, where ridiculously dressed dwarfs come crashing through the roof.If you are the least bit nihilistic in life, this movie will annoy you within ten minutes and have you thoroughly bitter after an hour. Sometimes I think this film was made to annoy the kind of people that hate musicals. If you hate musicals, frivolity and gaiety at all, this film is literally your worst nightmare.Mouline Rouge robs references anywhere it can find them and never apologizes for the plagiarism. Indeed it holds it up to you and demands you to laugh at it all. When a late 19th century love ballad, features copped lyrics from the group KISS, you know you've hit something wonderfully silly.Is this film great art? Most assuredly, just as chocolate ice cream is great food. This is a movie that will delight those with light hearts and discourage those with heavy souls, to the point where they'll become contemptuous of the film's success.Personally, I hope it wins Best Film of 2001. In a year filled with horror and fear, a film such as this, filled with such farcical spirit and tender song, is just the medicine we need.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Perfect!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't bore you with how great this movie is. It keeps its art with its opening and ending, its dazzle with the dance and the music, and our attention with the story. Its funny, sad, and overall, a great show. Surely all the other summaries have told you what its about (but frankly, who cares? This is one of the few movies you can watch for the whole purpose of a movie, or simply because ITS JUST SO FUN!)As said, this is almost perfect! So what kept me from giving it a ten? Two things, really.1) EDITING - I know editors are professionals. They get paid six digits for their work. I know you have to keep the story going. Otherwise, it's just a drown of music. But really, could it have hurt to have an extra second on each take? For me, it was just annoying to CONSTANTLY cut from place to place. Rarely did it slow. For 1/3 a second, you see a dress, but then it's a person, no wait, that was a - was that a dancing midget? No, it was the main character doing a quick solo - or was it something I was suppose to know for the story? Wait, what'd I miss when I thought that? Its just too overwhelming. I guess it was the point, but some people LIKE to actually see the characters DANCE, as opposed to quick shots of them jumping (honestly, that's how quick it was, I could only tell they were jumping at certain points.)2) SOUND - Sadly, I saw the movie on DVD, which was programmed for surround sound, which I don't have. So, naturally, the music and voices sounded muffled. Awful! And the worst part is, you KNOW it sounds TEN TIMES BETTER in a theatre. Perhaps I should have gotten the tape instead? Maybe this should be considered a bad DVD review... At least it has the dances in FULL ;)Either way, great movie, highly recommend. You get an acid trip without having to take acid!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I watched it I was cringing in embarrassment for the people responsible for this joke of a movie.Nevermind the kitsch, the insipid boy-meets-girl love story, the over the top sets, or the overacted characters.Nevermind the seemingly blissfully ignorant use of lines from rock songs which include the word 'love' but aren't about the physical love of the scenes that they accompany on the screen (hint: when John Lennon sang "all we need is love" he wasn't talking about a young hottie.) I kept thinking to myself of the line in The Princess Bride, "I do not think you know what that word means" as the characters in the movie kept repeating the word over, and over in a sort of mantra.The single biggest failure of this movie is this: musicals live or die on their scores, and Moulin Rouge's score is a ridiculous, uninspired pastiche of lines from 70s and 80s pop music. You would think they could've spent 1% less on the visual effects and hired someone to write an original score. Either that, or make a movie in some other genre. And say what you want, Ewan McGregor should stick to acting and leave the singing to the professionals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Post-modern musical dazzles the senses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1915, after a private White House screening of D.W. Griffith's silent Civil War epic Birth of a Nation, President Woodrow Wilson hailed the movie, saying, `It's like writing history with lightning.' If any movie deserves to carry the moniker `written with lightning,' it is Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge, a flamboyantly delirious post-modern spin on the creaky old `Let's-put-on-a-show' musical.From its opening frames, in which an orchestra conductor wildly conducts the 20th Century Fox fanfare, it is clear that Luhrmann is not going to play to expectations. Strains of `The Sound of Music' and `Nature Boy' lead us into Montmartre, the Bohemian corner of Paris, where a young writer named Christian (Ewan McGregor) is penning his latest tome, an ode to the only love he has ever known.The opening is somber and restrained, despite some truly eye-popping visual effects that take us into Christian's world. We are relaxed, but only for a moment. The second Christian's story propels into flashback, the audience is thrust into a world of sights and sounds that boggle (and almost assault) the mind. We are introduced to a bevy of bizarre characters, including John Leguizamo as a lisping Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jacek Koman as a narcoleptic Argentinian (don't ask) and Matthew Whittet as famed French composer Erik Satie.It seems this group of Bohemians are looking for a new poet to provide lyrics for their latest musical offering, Spectacular Spectacular. One sip of absinthe, and Christian has suddenly joined their band of merry men. Of course, it helps that he is able to compose such poetic ditties as, `The hills are alive with the sound of music,' on a moment's notice.It is here that we realize Luhrmann is going to populate his movie not only with a bizarre cast of characters, but they are going to be singing songs that we all know and love. It's a risky move, but Luhrmann makes it work as an integral convention for his story. Christian is a great and gifted poet. What better way to demonstrate this than by having him write truly memorable poems?As Christian soon learns, the Bohemians still need the backing of Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent, in a role that truly shows his range), owner of the title nightclub. And the star of the show is to be none other than Zidler's `sparkling diamond,' Satine (Nicole Kidman). Zidler, however, has other plans, which include using Satine to secure the financial backing of an evil duke (Richard Roxburgh) to turn his Moulin Rouge from a nightclub into a legitimate theater and courtesan Satine into a legitimate actress. Things get complicated (well, as complicated as this type of music could possibly get) when, through a case of mistaken identity, Satine and Christian wind up together and in love.That's the setup, and if it sounds like it borrows from countless other stories, well, it does. But Luhrmann knows this. He's not interested in telling a story that's never been told before. He wants to tell a story in a way that's never been done before.To this end, Luhrmann succeeds. After an opening act that literally never lets up (think the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan, only with song and dance), he settles into his story with a comfortable pace. We know pretty much everything that's going to happen for the next two hours, but thanks to Luhrmann's sometimes wacky sense of humor and truly phenomenal performances by his actors, it just doesn't matter.Of course, Moulin Rouge! is a musical, so the quality of its musical numbers certainly play a large role in the movie's success. And to that end, the big question for those who haven't seen the movie yet is, `Can Nicole and Ewan really sing?' Well, the answer is yes and no. McGregor's voice is the better of the two, strong and confident like a chorus line singer determined to get the agents to sit up an notice. Occasionally, he tries a little too hard (in one of the movie's final songs, he actually spits in Kidman's face), but that's all in keeping with the grand operatic passion that Luhrmann is trying to capture.Kidman can carry a tune, although she scoops up to some of her notes, and she sometimes seems a little unsure of herself. But her acting more than makes up for it. Her ability to range from light (very light) comedy to chest-thumping tragedy is truly remarkable. In her opening number (`Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend'), she displays a kittenish quality for which none of her previous performances has prepared us. And on top of that, thanks to Donald McAlpine's lush photography, she has simply never been more beautiful. If audiences didn't know better, they could easily mistake her for a movie goddess from the Golden Age.Broadbent shines in every scene he's in, almost stealing the entire movie away from its leads with his hilarious take on Madonna's `Like a Virgin.' Roxburgh is a fitting, if two-dimensional villain, while Leguizamo is reduced to only a few minor bits, none of which demonstrate the actor's incredible talents or the character's depth.But minor quibbles aside, Moulin Rouge! is not so much a movie as it is an experience. As Luhrmann has explained in interviews, the Moulin Rouge itself was the ultimate nightclub. The rush that people got from going to Zidler's electrified extravaganza in the 1890s is the same feeling modern audiences get from going to a great club with an awesome DJ. So, to give today's audiences that same feeling, Luhrmann has hired today's hottest remixers (including FatBoy Slim and Missy Elliott) to help fashion his musical statement. And he has cut his movie into quick edits, never once letting his camera sit still.Some have complained about Moulin Rouge!'s use of previously written songs, but again, this is a cultural statement that Luhrmann is making. Today's musical culture is rapidly becoming more and more dependent on sampling. So Moulin Rouge! is the first `sampled' movie, which could place it on the brink of a new post-modern movement in film. Only time will tell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because of my early birthday, I heard the ost before seeing the movie (it was a birthday gift from one of my friends). After hearing that amazing cd, I couldn't wait untill i saw the movie. Who'd thought that a movie about a city that I absolutely hate would make me feel they I do. But Buzz Luhrmann did the movie so... extraordinary. Listening to a 1900 singer singing "material girl" or to a pimp singing "like a virgin" just made me an addict to this awesome movie. Tough the reaction of many people (among them: My parents) wasn't too enthusiastic, and some even left it in the middle- I still believe that it is one of the best movies created ever, and the Oscars will soon prove me right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spectacular Musical!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge! achieves what few musicals have done in my life: wait for the next song! Usually, I feel that the songs in musicals halt the story, and become boring when the chorus is said for the fifth time... But it is not the same thing with Moulin Rouge!. First of all, the collection of popular songs that have been used to create the songs from Moulin Rouge! have the word "variety" written all over them. Lady Marmalade meets Smells Like Teen Spirits! The Police, The Beatles, Nirvana, Madonna... The list of bands and artists goes on and on... And everything is really well done! Even better, the story is being told by the songs instead of simply being repeated... But even better than the music is the visual style of the movie. If Luhrmann's camera moved too fast for you in Romeo and Juliet, don't even think about watching Moulin Rouge! without getting a headache. Everything feels larger than life, everything is moving. Beautiful colors invade the screen. This movie is a visual treat. Even better: the acting is actually quite good. Ewan McGregor, an actor I really like, is great and is on screen chemistry with Nicole Kidman is impressive. They are a great couple. And Kidman is beautiful, even more so than she usually is, which says a lot. This only makes it more credible that every man dreams of her. As a movie couple, Christian and Satine are fantastic. Luhrmann might be behind this, as Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes were another great on-screen couple in his previous movie. And John Leguizamo is impressive in the relatively small part of Toulouse-Lautrec. And lets not forget Jim Broadbent, as Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge!, another great addition to the cast. The most sursprising thing about Moulin Rouge!, though, might be the fact that the cliché story is actually quite touching. Basically, this could have been called "Romeo and Juliet Go To The Moulin Rouge", but everyone takes the classic storyline to life with such passion, and the characters are so effective that you dont mind the fact that you have been told a similar story quite a few times. From the beginning of the movie, Christian says that the story will end sadly, but you nevertheless keep hoping... Basically, this love story is much better than 1997's "Romeo and Juliet Are On A Boat", also known as Titanic. So the music is great, the acting is great, the story is involving and the movie is visually stunning. What more can you ask?87%</fullReview>

Nicole Kidmann (always timeless and ALWAYS beautiful) and Ewan McGregor do such a great job playing opposite of one another one actually believes that they are totally in love. Being a huge fan of anything with romance and tragedy I was left in awe at the end of the movie. If this doesn't win best picture this year than we know the Oscars are rigged. I also loved the use of music in this movie (though it was obviously cliché). It was so well used to carry the story and not to promote the musicians that it made it interesting to listen to as well as watch. Like I said before... WOW!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A musical masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard all sorts of reasons for why Moulin Rouge is a "horrible" movie. "I didn't care about the characters" or "Its too wild and it's just nonsense" or "the songs were not original and the Pop songs they used were horrible." All these reasons might be true if you were watching the movie with your eyes closed. This movie is viabrant and spectacular and the music had such an impact on me. For people who don't care about the characters I can only say that you have no heart because this movie had so much emotion. If you think its nonsense then you probably don't like musicals. "I hate the way people just sing out of no where," says my friend during a conversation about the movie. Maybe so, but that's what musicals are all about. The Director of Moulin Rouge said that musicals during the time of the 40's would use music from the 40's to describe what was happening at an earlier time. This is the same way Moulin Rouge works by giving us songs from many 1970's 80's and 90's generations. This movie is not nonsense with a beautifully written script, score, and talented singing actors who worked hard on this dazzling spectacle. This movie completely took my breath away. If you have not already seen it then rent it! Hopefully it will be considered for a Best Picture Nomination at the Academy Awards.</fullReview>

"Moulin Rouge" stays totally faithful to its TRUE source of inspiration: the myth of Orpheus from Greek Mythology. I'm not even gonna explain it for you. Get off your lazy cans and go read it for yourselves. They've taken Orpheus and his ill fated bride, moved them to a fantasy location loosely based on turn of the century Paris, and simply told their story in that fashion. Look it up.</fullReview>

Well, it certainly slows down an otherwise excellent and truly original film...There are definitely some "leave the room for popcorn" moments while Kidman and MacGregor talk about their relationship (yawn). Also, the duke is a real tiresome bore of a character, but as the "foil" to interject the dramatic obstacle that keeps the two lovers apart, it's a thankless role.You won't miss a thing if you leave during a slow, talky part-- just make sure to get back before the singing and dancing starts again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge, directed by Baz Luhrmann tells the story of a young writer Christian (Ewan McGreggor) who falls in love the beautiful courtesean Satine (Nicole Kidman)in Paris in 1899. It is a movie that made me laugh and it made me cry and most of all it made me want to love and be loved in return.  The singing and dancing was amazing. During the opening dance sequence was a little odd to see it for the first time and the choices of songs they chose were a little interesting (Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit is one example) but all in all it was fun. But what made me first love the movie was when the first time Ewan McGreggor sang. I just fell in love wih the movie from that point on. That was an amazingly beautiful version of Your Song. I get chills just thinking about it. Another part that made me want to sing and dance was the Spectacular Spectacular part. When they were telling the Duke what the musical was going to be about. "Spectacular, Spectacular, it's not in your vernacular." And Come What May. What can I possibly say about that beautiful song. Ewan and Nicole sang it so perfectly together, their voices just make the song even more special. It should have won for Best Song at the Golden Globes. That was a scam. The direction by Baz Luhrmann was visionary. I never saw anything like it before and it was amazing. Christian believes that all you need is love and above all things is love. Thanks to this movie, I am beginning to think that way too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many others, I read the reviews on this movie and passed it up. I saw it on the shelves and passed it up. I saw Nicole Kidman win a Golden Globe for her performance and decided, "Why not". I struggled for my one line summary and while so many words tried to fill the text, only "Awesome" emerged.I grew up a fan of musicals and of large ensemble casts. Movies with Fred Astaire (Singin' In The Rain, Top Hat, Swing Time), Marilyn Monroe (Gentlemen Prefer Blondes), and classics such as The Sound of Music, The Wizard of Oz, Music Man. So I am pleased that finally a movie of my generation - one with grandiose singing and dancing can rank among timeless classics.Nicole and Ewan McGregor pull off amazing performances in this wonderful movie. The cinematics are sure to leave you bedazzled. The lights, the sounds, the imagery, the imagination of Baz Lurhmann is nothing short of spectacular.If you are not able to see this on the big screen, I suggest you find the largest T.V. you can find, turn up the sound, sit back and enjoy this treat for your senses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An elegant and sophisticated 'in-your-face' experience...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> With an array of dizzying visuals, cutthroat editing and outlandish and frenetic camera movement, Director Baz Luhrman delivers a brash and stylish modern-day musical. ?Moulin Rouge' is an experience within itself that contains an original and organic storytelling technique that encompasses the viewer in lights, visuals and music. Director Baz Luhrmann opens this film in an ?in- your- face' manner and seems to never let go except when he wants to underline and convey emotion in this film. The rest of the time is spent experimenting with the lighting, framing his film in an elegant manner and basically bringing the viewer on an ?eye-candy' joy ride that is superseded with its' elegant and engaging romantic story. At the turn of the new Millennium in 1899, a Paris ?bordello', the Moulin Rouge is home to a host of diverse and intriguing characters that convene every night for one sole purpose ? Sex. This film makes no mistake at masquerading its' sensuality which is portrayed by an appropriately titled character; Satine. Nicole Kidman exudes her sex appeal as the Moulin's main attraction as she completely invigorates this film with her beauty matched by her soothing voice. Ewan McGregor is Christian, who through a case of mistaken identity becomes acquainted with the slim and curvy Satine and thus in turn becomes infatuated with this woman leading to a relationship between the two. As they both fall madly in love with each other, their relationship; if exposed can ruin their collective efforts in a huge theatrical production they are both creating. As Christian writes the piece and places Satine as his main character, their relationship catches the eye of the production's financier who has been attempting to woo the seductress. As conflict arises, music gets louder, characters get brassier and the film leapfrogs from moments of absolute musical genius with their dance sequences to a romantic drama as two star-crossed lovers must choose their fate. The film is an exercise in what I have coined ?exhaustive entertainment'; which doesn't necessarily mean it is a bad thing. The term refers to the film's myriad of elements thrown into a two-hour opulent piece that by the end of the film, the discerning viewer has had more than his fair share in visual astonishment. Some harsh critics might criticize the film for being too frenetic and escapist ? and perhaps that was exactly the intention; but it is still a great piece of film. The film contains a superb supporting cast including Richard Roxburgh as the insanely jealous financier and Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler, the larger than life owner of the underground establishment which seems to be the center of convention for the French Elitists in this strange yet crude subculture. And who can forget John Leguizamo, as the midget Tolouse-Latrec, Christian's friend and ally against an over-ruling Financier. It is evident that one's taste will either be indulged or turned sour after the first 30 minutes. Luhrman sets the film in a dizzying manner that it seems to extract itself from the opening musical sequence that has completely reinvented the manner in which musicals will be seen in the future. With the wild imagery and progressive sexual innuendo, this film is a testament to how a vision can be so strongly brought to the screen in an appeasing manner. With strong performances, vivid filmmaking and absolutely stunning cinematography, this film is a definite must-see, if not for the film's aesthetic, for the modern-day music revivals that compliment this film. From Madonna's ?Like a Virgin' sequence that still in my eyes is the movie's best scene, to U2's ?In the Name of Love' sung in a formidable manner that brings truth to this ballad. This film completes itself on so many levels and is purely a great cinematic experience. Giancarlo's Rating: *** (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To view this movie, one must prepare to lose oneself in the greatness of Baz Luhrmann's imagination. I had initially seen this movie in theatre and could not just watch it once. I had to return again and again. And every time I was there, I would lose myself in the world that is the Moulin Rouge! And now that I have had the opportunity to include it in my own DVD collection it has not left my player for very long.I have been a fan of Luhrmann's since I had the opportunity to watch "Strictly Ballroom" and that in turn led me to see "Romeo + Juliet" But after watching "Moulin Rouge!", I am convinced that this man is a genius. The costumes and the set design compliment his vision of Paris at the turn of the century. Plus his choice of the colours, the lighting and the shading, highlight or accent the emotions and the drama of each scene as they unfold.And where to begin with the score? To hear modern songs sung in the style of a "rock opera" just absolutely blew my mind. Your senses will soar every time a character breaks out in song. The medleys are inspiring and you could see that each actor put himself/herself on the line to perform the numbers. Their dedication is evident, and makes the songs more powerful and wonderful. The chance they all took to sing with such emotion and strength, is something to admire and be amazed by. And don't worry, the choreography is not out done by the music, rather it's on equal ground. The dance sequences are absolutely magical and tell a story itself.If you take a step back to just lose yourself in the movie, you will have a moment of clarity and fully understand what Luhrmann is all about. The vastness that is his imagination is captured in all of the elements that make up the masterpiece that is the Moulin Rouge!But this film would not have been as brilliant or so inspiring if it wasn't for the cast, and especially Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. They were so real that the audience could not help but feel what the two forbidden lovers felt, and saw what they saw. The talent that these two possess is unlimited and they definitely gave Satine and Christian the depth and development that they richly deserved.If you dismissed "Moulin Rouge!" the first time around, don't pass it up on your next opportunity. This is definitely a movie that will leave you breathless by the time the curtain closes. And you will want to experience that intensity all over again.</fullReview>

(2001) Rating: 9/10Director and co-writer (with Craig Pearce) Baz Luhrmann describes the style he brought to the Australian dance flick Strictly Ballroom and his underrated take on William Shakespeare's Romeo &amp; Juliet as "red curtain theatricality". He likes to deal with familiar types of stories (so the audience knows how it will end) taking place in sort of a heightened reality, with plenty of devices reminding the audience that they're watching a movie. Moulin Rouge! is a perfect example of that. It's not interested in the banal and the realistic, it's Cinema!!, with a capital 'C' and plenty of exclamation points! Music! Flying colors! Dancing! Emotions set free! Slapstick! LOVE! The red curtain opens (literally) and then we're off for one wild ride, a rocky electric cancan boogie playing over a love rollercoaster, as seen through the lenses of a filmmaker with a vision equal parts Méli?s, Technicolor 1950s musicals and MTV.It's quite overwhelming at first, but in a good way. Luhrmann's frenetic back and forth camerawork puts you in the same state of mind as Christian as he enters the Moulin Rouge for the first time. On one side powdered girls are doing their thing, chanting the "Voulez-Vous couchez avec moi?" chorus from "Lady Marmelade", while across the way a bunch of men in tuxedos are emulating Kurt Cobain and proclaiming "Here we are now, entertain us...", meanwhile Zigler is screaming "Because you can can-can!" on Fatboy Slim's electronic beats... And then Satine floats down on a trapeze crooning "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friends" and takes everybody's breath away... The men's, Christian's... Ours.That's another thing; it's good to be able to craft energetic, entertaining musical numbers, but there's the danger to end up with a futile, purposeless costume revue. This never happens here because, as familiar and melodramatic as the story can be, it still involves us completely. We really feel for these passionate lovers doomed to hide their affair. When we see Satine for the first time, we fall in love with her along with Christian, and we root for him, for them, through the rest of the film. The delightfully twisted musical numbers that punctuate their tale aren't gratuitous but integral to the drama. Most every important declaration is made through song, be it Christian belting out Elton John's "Your Song" ("How wonderful life is while you're in the world...") or Satine serenading him with "Come What May" (one of the movie's few originals, and a great one at that - expect an Oscar nomination), or the both of them discoursing about love with lyrics from famous songs from The Beatles, Kiss, David Bowie, Paul McCartney, Joe Cocker, Whitney Houston. Plus, not only to the songs fit in thematically, they're also reinvented in original ways. The Police's "Roxane" becomes a tango, Madonna's "Like a Virgin" becomes a show tune...Then there's the outrageous sets and costumes, the frantic choreography, the endless variety of camera angles and editing tricks... And above all, love, as communicated by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in what could be career peaks for both. Kidman is just lovable, sexy, warm and goofy, nothing like the icy bombshell she once appeared to be. McGregor is at the other end of the spectrum from diving into toilets, all charm and idealism, love obsessed writer, blue-eyed dreamer... And when put together, extraordinary chemistry erupts, they just gel together, they BELONG with one another! And they can sing too! Who knew these two had such nice voices? They're nicely surrounded by a cast of enjoyably caricatural supporting characters, from John Leguizamo's high-on-absinthe dwarf to Jim Broadbent's life of the party burly man and Richard Roxburgh' moustache-twirling Snidely Whiplash of a villain.Moulin Rouge! is what film lovers have been waiting for all year. Here's a movie that makes you giddy with joy and eager to see it again and again. Spectacular Spectacular indeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Triumph of Style over Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film which epitomizes what is wrong with so many movies today. Let's dazzle them with rapid film images, scrupulously designed cinematography and loud music. This film, once you get over the excitement of these features, leaves you with nothing to think about or be emotionally moved by. The story is nothing but a rehash of the classic melodramatic story plot of most 1930s' musicals. Fortunately, in those musicals, we had memorable and creative music. This film's music is one big disaster and the story is basically idiotic. The most embarrassing moments in the film are the ones in which Nicole Kidman sings. Her attempt to be Marilyn Monroe in her opening number is the worst piece of film music I have ever had to sit through. Even the poor singing Ewan McGregor is not as annoying. The relative lack of musical imagination in this film is staggering. Except for two moderately original song and dance numbers, this film is a musical nightmare.I can not really understand the hype regarding this film. It is mediocre and ultimately unsatisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Toulouse-Lautrect must be gagging in his grave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because I am gagging at his depiction in this film.I had been waiting for Moulin Rouge for more then a year. Everyelement of it was making me drool at the mouth. Ewan Mcgreggor,Baz and Kidman. I love Baz's Romeo and Juliette and StrictlyBallroom. Well crafted with a dream like qualities.I am an art history and film student, so I saw the mixing the timeperiod, modern music and these period characters seemed likethe coolest idea I had ever heard. I was dead wrong. THE ONLYWORDS THAT CAN DESCRIBE THIS MOVIE IS?. SILLY, SILLY, SILLY! The marketing for this movie made it look like a love storywith drama. It should have been, romantic comedy with silly danceand song numbers. The choice of music was great but I felt like they were treated withthe intent to ridicule and they were always over the top. Example.`The Like a virgin' sequence. The funny way in which the butlersdanced made the scene silly made me want to wretch (not tomention the camera shots). I always think that this scene couldhave been much better if it would have been done with a serioustone. Imagine the emotional impact of describing Satine'semotions being described with `Like a Virgin' in a seriousmanner. Try it in your mind. You will be surprised on how it couldhave been more effective. Tears and pain rather then a sillyroutine. The only scene I enjoyed was the `Roxanne' sequencewhere the dance was actually well choreographed and well intercut. Kudos for this scene. But only this scene. But the one thing that made me angry was the way Toulouse-Lautrect was portrayed by the script. A silly little man? Ido not think so. He pratically invented Showtime posters andcabaret art. He was a genius. Sure he took one too many bottles ofabsinthe but all in all he was supposed to be a genius.All in all I have to say it is the worst movie I have scene in a longwhile. Okay Battlefield earth was worse!!!! I know that MOULINROUGE is the most divided movie amongst critics of the year. I amsorry, I fall on the hate.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The pace at the beginning is frantic - but it's a wild, magical and fascinating ride. There has never been a movie like this folks. The production quality, visuals, special effects, settings, and more are all truly spectacular. Of special note is the "Tango de Roxanne" which will leave you believing that "Roxanne" had to be written in 1900. The brilliant arrangement of the song and the vision of 30 couples simultaneously dancing a dirty, almost violent tango is absolutely captivating. Other numbers of note are the hilarious send up of "Like a Virgin" and the "Lovers Medley". See it. This isn't just a movie - it's a life experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awsome Musical, not for all tastes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, Stop right now and sit down. This one isn't for everyone. I brought this one home as a rental, and the little lady almost immediately settled into the `you'll owe me for this' mode. I absolutely loved this one. And from what I can see on the net, sounds like our reaction(s) were fairly typical. This is a love it or hate it flick.Do me a favor. Think back to `Romeo and Juliet' w/ Leonardo and Claire Daines. Remember the drunken party at the Capulets? Remember the scene w/ Juliet's mother before the party, full of accelerated frame rates and wacky music? If those were your favorite scenes from that movie, you'll love this one. Other wise, it probably won't work for you. Come to think of it, the overall style structure of Romeo is almost copied to the beat for this one. Surprise, Surprise; they are both done by the same director; Baz Luhrmann.The opening 10 minutes are the litmus test of the whole flick. The grand sweep through the Paris set, up to Christian's apartment w' the Narcoleptic Argentinean and Dwarf Bohemian, then steam rolling into the Moulin Rouge w/ the loudest musical intro I can remember; this all sets the scene for event that follows. But of course, I would commit a sin if I didn't mention the opening conductor over the 20th Century Logo.This is a movie that takes all the typical (predictable) conventions of movie mechanics and throws them out the window. The editing can be frantic, often cutting to 3 or 4 different cameras in less that 2 seconds. The acting is over the top, especially with the owner of the club. And the music becomes an extra character. It is shocking what songs they try (and mostly accomplish) to work into the dialogue of the musical. `Material Girl' works into Santine's opening number, `Your Song' becomes the main love song, and even `Roxanne' gets reinvented into a drunken tango while being cut between three different sequences.Quickly about the movie mechanics. The story is surprisingly simple, a love story of star-crossed lovers in an age where love should be simpler, but as always this story has been told before. I did like the old play-in-a-play routine that went right over the head of the Duke until it was thrust in his face during the final rehearsal. The acting is above average; witness the comedy of errors between Christian and Santine during their initial meeting. The Visuals, style and presentation are top notch.Yet again I've found a `frameable' movie, where every frame is a work of art. Every sequence and camera movement is a choreographed ballet. One of my favorite sequences in the whole movie takes place in the `Elephant' from the time the Duke walks in on Christian and Santine, to the improvised rehearsal and final group presentation. The energy in this scene alone puts whole other movies to shame.Unconsciously, I've written most of this review so far without actually mentioning the names of Ewan or Nicole. They just totally sold me on becoming the characters. Nicole has finally crawled out from under the shadow of tom (small t) and established herself as a legitimate leading lady. And John Leguizamo once again amazes me with his ability to play supporting roles. He has enough personality to grab your attention, and enough sense to step aside and not showboat.Any negatives? Just a few minor ones. After the first half hour, there is a noticable downshift in the energy as the plot kicks in and things get more serious. In the long run, that is probably the wise move, as the initial celebration can not realistically be maintained. But it is missed. There is also one point where the songs cross the line between excess style and offensiveness, and that is where we have a fat red-haired man with a mock nun's outfit singing `like a virgin'. just a bit outside of where I needed to go.Oh, and by the way, anyone who wants to see this movie in anything other than widescreen is out of their freaking mind. The opening curtain alone would be destroyed. And there are numerous shots where the cinematographer obviously decided to ignore the Pan n Scan idea and shoot dance numbers that took up the far left and far right at the same time. The DVD is gorgeous. I wish I had seen this in the theater, with a full sound system and 80 ft screen. IMAX anyone?Just treat it as a musical and this is hard to put down. 9/10</fullReview>

All I had heard/watched was the Lady Marmelade video on MTV.Needless to say, it was a pleasant surprise. The potpourri of incredible actors, both leading roles and supporting cast; and inventive usage of modern and old songs gave the movie an incredible presence. Laughing and crying at the same time. Amazing.It's really a simple story, yet it moved me quite a bit unlike most other movies.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Moulin Rouge a few months ago, but was just thinkin about it tonight while listening to the soundtrack. I loved this movie, though at first it seemed like the sort of film I would hate, I was drawn in and by the end I was used to the continual breaking into song and sudden bursts of color or sweeping camera shots. Nicole Kidman is fantastic, I have never been much of a fan before, but I thought she was fab in this, she also has a surprisingly good singing voice. Ewan McGregor was also very good, I had never thought much of him before either. They had great chemistry and I loved their duets.Overall this film was fantastic, the story may be simple with the ending revealed early on, but look past this and you will see the magic of this film. it is the type of movie that makes you smile and want to break into song (maybe not..)A beautiful piece of film that is as colorful and crazy as it is original and touching. Spectacular Spectacular!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the top 100 films ever created. Period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it 4 times in theatres and couldn't get enough of it. There is magic in the film, the music, characters and production. It is simply a phantasmogoria of delight, innovative, romantic, haunting, and O so wonderfully tragic. I was in love with all the characters simultaneously - a very rare occurance.Baz Luhrmann is simply a genius of geniuses. His vision, new ideas, and depth of discovery is awesome. I purchased the DVD to give to a friend for Christmas. Watched it on a large screen and still weep and joy for Christian, what a great character. I sure wish Ewan had won best actor in a musical or comedy at Golden Globes. At least he was honored but it would have been so uplifting had he also won. As it was, Nicole was honored, rightfully so and so was the film - best in its category.I deeply hope that Oscar recognizes the greatness of Moulin Rouge. It deserves to be re-released so that those who missed this masterpiece, will have the opportunity of seeing it for the first time. Moreover, I affirm here and now that Moulin Rouge will be nominated in all the following categories: Best film, Best director, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best supporting actor, Best screenplay, best art direction, best musical score, best song in a motion picture, best costume design.It deserves this kind of recognition. For those naysayers who didn't get the film, for those who said it was over the top, don't believe them. If you haven't seen Moulin Rouge, you missed out on a fantastic masterwork of cinema. Just go buy it, rent it, or watch it at a friend's house. It is the best darm film of 2001.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw the film, I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. I came away not really sure what the colorful, unique, fast-paced piece of art was really all about. I liked it, but I didn't know why. But this is not a shortcoming of the film, but probably its greatest strength: it makes you watch it again.and again...and again until you cannot stop.Moulin Rouge creates its own genre: a mixture of a musical, a comedy, a romance, a drama, and a tragedy. It is also a mixture of a film, a play, and a dance show. It takes the best from each of these genres and each of these art mediums to create an unforgettable classic. Baz Luhrmann has succeeded in creating a world that you can escape to, be entertained by, be moved by, and never want to leave.Although many of the songs in the film are not original, the film transforms popular songs into "Moulin Rouge" music. The songs fit seamlessly into the story and are sung and danced to with such talent, that soon the film version of the song may become your favorite. The music is simply exceptional. The soundtrack, unfortunately, does not take many of the best songs from the film and, in fact, only one of the songs on the soundtrack is exactly how it appears in the film.Besides the music, the other strongest asset of the film is the acting. Each actor/actress creates such an indelible and developed character that it will be difficult to accept the actors/actresses playing roles in any other film. For example, Ewan McGregor seemed totally out of place in Black Hawk Down, his next feature film, playing a soldier (with a virtually shaved head) in the U.S. Army. Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent, and Richard Roxburgh tie the choppy scenes of the film together and all deserve awards. The surprisingly good singing by Kidman, McGregor, and Broadbent, who provide their own voices for their songs, define their characters.What truly makes the film a classic is that you can go to any scene in the film and be both entertained and moved. Every scene is done with such style, such phenomenal acting, and often performed to stunning music and dance, that this film has a timeless quality.Besides being entertaining, what makes a film a truly great and unforgettable film is if it has meaning. From beginning to end, Moulin Rouge is about "Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all Love." Moulin Rouge is in fact a fairy tale, and like all classic fairy tales, its purpose is not only to transport you into another world, but also to leave you with a new meaning about your own world. "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return."So, remember, watch Moulin Rouge open-minded, and then see it again and again and again...10/10 -- One of the best films, one of the best musicals, and one of the best love stories ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I am a guy who loves historical dramas, action movies, horror movies, and other guy mentality related stuff. Secondly, let it be known that I love Moulin Rouge! Moulin Rouge is not only my favorite movie of 2001,(LOTR being a close second), but also my favorite surprise of the year. I did not expect to like this film. I left the theatre confused. "Was I supposed to like this movie?" I asked myself. "Oh man are my friends gonna make fun of me." But who cares. I'm sure everyone out there has felt passion for a movie. I felt true passion for Moulin Rouge! What caught me first was, of course, the music. Please, Academy, recognize this crowning achievement. Through the music I was taken into the story with an amazing clarity. I felt the emotions of all the characters. I laughed with them, and yes, cried with them. I have new respect for the young Jedi Ewan. Ladies &amp; Gents, this guy can sing. This guy can sing good! And so can the lovely Nicole. The two of them were a screen match made in heaven. And you can't go wrong with John "The Pest" Leguizamo playing the great, vertically challenged, french painter Toulouse-Lautrec. This great film was well worth the taunting jeers of my stupid friends (ignorance is bliss to them if ya know what I mean). Forget what you think you know, and just enjoy what a true screen gem looks and feels like. Then buy the soundtrack and DVD like I did.</fullReview>

For the audience who love musicals, and 'Romeo &amp; Julie', 'Moulin Rouge!' is really worth seeing, and even if that the movie slow downs at a time with the many love songs, there is a dramatic and exciting ending of the movie. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor is a very nice pair in this movie, but even the two bad guys of the movie steals the scenes, and they does it nice too, with their flamboyant acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's nothing quite like director Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge; it's in a class by itself...a reinvention of the Hollywood musical in an explosion of color, motion, music and surprises. For some, the frenetic pace of the first half hour or so may be overwhelming and a bit frustrating, as your eyes beg for the camera to slow down. Especially in the large-scale dance numbers, it seems every lightening-fast camera angle has so much going on, your appetite for more and a chance to linger are merely increased. Fortunately, the pace of the film does diminish a little as the story advances. Carrying the plot are Nicole Kidman as the seductive Satine, a courtesan of the highest caliber, and Ewan McGregor as Christian, a struggling writer who hopes to score a hit at the Moulin Rouge. Both actors have never been in better form. Kidman is nothing less than ravishing as Satine, and in spite of her visual impact, manages to bring an element of humanity to her character...an element that could easily have been lost in a haze of glamour and pretension. Likewise, McGregor rises above the clamor and brings a sense of genuineness to his portrayal of a lowly artist who is overpowered by his love for Satine and his dream of creating a mega-hit on stage.One of the film's biggest surprises are the singing voices of both actors, especially McGregor's, and the fact that even though most of the film's songs are very familiar, they succeed...thanks to innovative arrangements and staging. Actor Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler turns in an effective performance as the nightclub's oily proprietor, though John Liguizamo's shrill portrayal of Toulouse-Lautrec was a bit irritating and over the top. Perhaps best of all, the overall plot, which is based on a relatively simple love story, doesn't get overshadowed or become insignificant in spite of the film's highly sensorial, stylized nature. So we end up with a unique cinematic experience that is both visually and viscerally stunning, and emotionally moving. It's the best of all worlds and heralds a new chapter in musicals on film, maybe even a comeback.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i can't believe there are so many negative reviews of this movie here. i must admit that i thought this movie looked like it was going to be just plain stupid when i first saw the trailers/previews. i wasn't EVER planning on seeing it, until my boss (i work at a videostore) recommended it to me and said she watched it twice in a row and would want to see it again. coming from a 50 something year old woman, i thought i'd give it a shot, i was amazed that somebody THAT age would love it so much!i watched it and thought that the beginning was really idiotic. i couldn't stand it. once it got started though, and christian started to sing "your song," i enjoyed it. the ending made me cry really hard.. i ended up just thinking that i liked the movies and the other parts were just okay. but it really stuck with me. i bought it a few weeks later and listen to the songs constantly. ewan mcgregor and nicole kidman are really talented actors and i LOVE their singing, despite what other people say.i know this movie isn't for everybody. i wouldn't recommend it to most men. but it DOES grow on you. i love all of it now and have become a big fan of ewan mcgregor's work. it deserves all the praise that it gets!!do NOT let others negatives opinions of this movie stop you from watching it. i give it a definite 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is hard to describe Moulin Rouge! in words. You kind of have to see it to believe. I rented it, and after the first 20 minutes I was not enchanted, but rather wondering what the heck Mr. Luhrmann was thinking when he made this film. Somehow this movie drew me in. By the end I was blown away. Nicole Kidman's performance was good, but I did not see anything fantastic about it. What surprised me the most was Ewan MacGregor as Christian. I have seen him in movies before and never thought much of him, but I was absolutely captivated by his performance, which is definitely award-worthy. You cannot help but fall in love with him and feel all the emotions which he so aptly portrays. It is one of those movies that you will either love or hate, and you cannot judge it form the beginning. You must go into it with an open mind, knowing that it will be out of the ordinary. I have bought the soundtrack and cannot wait to buy the DVD. Never before have I seen a movie that has intrigued me as much as this. I reccomend that everyone see this movie. I cannot guarantee that you will love it, but I can guarantee that it is like nothing you have ever seen before.</fullReview>

It's so touching and real-inspite of director's unusual touch-that when it's finished, it leaves you screaming for more. Like "ROMEO+JULIET", this is another extraordinary movie; it starts so fast and surprising that you can't move an inch on your seat! the set designs, music, acting and all about this movie are fabulous; the insertion of some of the most memorablelove songs and the oldfashioned romance is so tantalizing, you can't believe. "Does anybody know what we are living for?" I personally doubt it, but like the film, I belive Love is eternal but SHOW MUST GO ON... the finale is a heartbreaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a let-down. Could have been titled "Great Expectations"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love a good musical. Based on all the glowing reviews about this movie, we rented the DVD and sat back to experience. Wow! After about 30 minutes, we began wondering if this was really it. I kept expecting it to change gears and shift into the "wonderful musical" we had heard/read about. Instead, we were treated to the first movie in years to be turned-off before it was over.This movie/musical is a hodge-podge of snippets from many movies and songs of the past 30 years, or so. From "Hello Dolly" (now that was an entertaining musical) to "Sound of Music". From Madonna's "Like a Virgin", to Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit". It appears to have been put together like a collage. Someone cut-out a number of songs, and routines from previous movies/musicals, and pasted them on a poster-board which then became the outline of this musical.Thin plot line. Voices of the leads that lacked depth. Very impressionistic. The most positive thing I can say is that Nicole did look rather nice in some of the costumes she was wearing.All in all, I think of this as the "Scary Movie" of musicals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful musical storytelling strung together by theatrical silliness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While amazing by stage standards I had mixed feelings at the onset of this rendition. Though starting with a clever opening this film quickly finds itself mired in silliness and visual cacophony. What has been repeatedly described as production brilliance seemed at first a garish mess of opulent design and flashy costume only suited for a vaudeville production. However, the opening sequences do serve to set the stage, as it were, for the rest of the film. The music is where the real magic begins. At the onset of the first duet with Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman I was hooked for the duration. The music of this piece is clever and inventive while being almost wholly unoriginal at the same time. The songwriters have tapped into some 50 years of pop songs about `Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all, Love' and woven them together in powerful, evocative fashion in many cases transcending the original versions. In similar fashion to Dancer in the Dark (though no further comparison applies), the film is at its most pleasurable peak during the musical numbers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stylishly Anti-Period Period Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the greatest satisfaction as a movie watcher is a film that shatters all negative expectations for it. I came into "Moulin Rouge!" with a huge bias, due simply to the horrid cover of "Lady Marmalade" on MTV and the radio, which was my only exposure to the movie. Were it not for my friend's older sister reassuring me that the song was only in the actual movie for one sequence of a few minutes at most, I never would've seen it at all. I'm glad I listened to her, because this is a colorful, musical masterpiece, though at times its a little messy.The cornerstone of "Moulin Rouge!", being a musical of sorts, is the music. Most of the film's musical numbers are not original, and are composed of resung samples from songs ranging from U2 to Elton John (its fun just trying to see how fast one can recognize the sample). While a few of these are cute, others are strange and/or just too much (the whole bit from "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was so absurd I had to laugh, but the Madonna made me groan). Probably the best musical sequence is Fatboy Slim's hard hitting "Can Can" (although ironically enough, this is the aforementioned sequence with the dreaded "Lady Marmalade", luckily it is mostly drowned out by the beat) that looks and feels like a modern club. However, that is what makes most of these sequences so odd; why bother setting the film in 1900 as a period piece if the music and choreography totally remove it from that era?Besides the music, the film's grand atmosphere comes from the stunning visuals. This is Baz Luhrmann at his best and every editor's worst nightmare; every club/rehearsal/play scene packs in enough color, lights, and costumes to put Cirque du Soleil to shame. Its not just that these scenes feature so many things going on, but that the collage of it all is put together so "efficiently"; most of the time it feels necessary, as opposed to just filler (there are still moments where the film seems more like a long string of music videos as opposed to a film, though not as many as I would've expected). On that rare occasion when a sequence turned out sloppy, however, all the overindulgence causes the film to cough up some awful cinematographic vomit (though this only happened once or twice to the point where it really bothered me, mostly from the camera jumping around and switching sequences too much). Unfortunately, since each sequence is so big (if anything, they get bigger and bigger throughout the film) all this simply adds up to too much to see and digest in just one viewing, so, as brilliant as they are, only the grandest of these grand sequences will leave an impression (but what an impression it is!).Underneath all this style, amazingly enough, is a movie (albeit a weak one). Though the plot is cliche-ridden (the most disappointing thing about the movie) and obviously depends on its visual/audio sequences to keep interest (tons of style makes up for an almost total lack of substance), it is held afloat by some excellent supporting performances from Richard Roxburgh, Jim Broadbent, and whomever played Christian's eccentric Bohemian artist colleagues/neighbors. Though their acting wasn't lacking, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman should really be commended for their singing performances, which were much better than I could have ever hoped."Moulin Rouge!" was a pleasant surprise, but there is just too much to handle. Although I did enjoy it, its thorough lack of anything interesting in the plot (I had the whole thing telegraphed within the first half hour) and constant one-up-manship over itself will ensure that for repeated viewings its more worth it to just skip through and watch your favorite sequences (the aforementioned "Can Can" and the ending) again, rather than the whole film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for "Moulin Rouge!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen this film on the big screen, try to. I saw it on DVD and the sets are so lavish and unique that I know it must have looked (excuse the pun) "spectacular" in the theaters. But however glamorous the sets, this movie won't be to everyone's taste, in fact some may find it flat out strange. Set in 1899 Montmartre France, this is the tale of a struggling writer's (McGregor) attempt to win the love of a beautiful courtesan (Kidman), all the while trying to elude the evil villain (played splendidly by Roxburgh). Although set in 1899, this musical is scored with such modern day music, as "Your Song", "The Sound of Music", "Like a Virgin". Yes, it's an odd combination, but the music is incorporated into the scenes well (sometimes quite comically), and the performances of all involved are not to be missed. I was, however, a bit disappointed towards the end of the film, when the story line loses some of its witty edge and delves instead into an attempt at over dramatization. Here the film becomes unfortunately more laughable than it intends, yet this small glitch does not reduce any affection I felt for this unique and enjoyable musical. Love it or hate it, you won't forget it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie takes the classical tragic love story and tells it in a unique and beautiful way. The colors, the drama, the dizzy wonderment really captures you in the film and causes you to feel the good and the bad with the characters. (And though it is a love story guys - it is NOT a chick-flick) Pure genius to use Madonna, The Police, Nirvana and many more in a film taking place in 1900 Paris and actually make it work. To appreciate Moulin Rouge, you have to over look a seemingly simplistic plot and dialogue and enter into a fantastical world of music, dance, color and unique cinematography. In film style it reminds me of a combination of Brazil and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (a bizarre combo I know). I am in love with this movie and have been recommending it to everyone (something I rarely do). Watch it, enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking filmmaking to fall in love with!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film is unique in that it combines all other forms of media to create a more complete "picture" of any given story. When plot, picture, &amp; performance are at their best, the result is excellence. Such is the case with Moulin Rouge! I will admit the plot could have been stronger, but then again, if it had been more complex, it may have been too much for filmgoers to take. After all, an audience is asked to withstand power punch camera shots (I would have hated to be the editor on this one), bizarre musical concepts, quirky characters, etc. throughout the film. Plot weakness aside, the performances more than make up for it. And the picture quality (artistic set design, directing, cinematography) is the best I've ever seen. This is a film people will recognize in years to come as one that set a new standard and opened doors for future filmmakers to fulfill their creative senses. BRILLIANCE! Can't wait to see what Baz Luhrmann comes up with next. I hope Moulin Rouge! didn't drain his imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was first to see 'Moulin Rouge', many people strongly warned me to not to waste my time. However, the trailers had enticed me and so, I sat down to watch now one of my favourite all time films. 'Moulin Rouge' is a fantastic love story, musically enhanced and set in the early 1900s. Nicole Kidman did a wonderful job portraying Satine, and Ewan McGregor's voice is absolutely fantastic. I rewatched the movie just to hear him sing again. I admit however that some scenes where a little bit, um, unusual. For example, when Satine is trying to seduce Christian (whom at the time she thinks is the Duke ), I was a little bit thrown off. You can't help but groaning, "Nicole! How could you?" However, you do have to remember that Satine was a prostitute. All in all, I'd say that 'Moulin Rouge' is an excellant film with fantastic musical numbers ('Come What May' and 'Roxanne'). But then again, I can't guarantee that you are going to enjoy this movie. I suppose it all depends on how open you are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As great as an Opera.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always liked the musicals and the Opera. And this movie makes a use of the music I rarely saw on a film. It introduces a leit-motiv, a musical theme for every plot theme, following the rules created by Wagner and Verdi: Your song and Come what may, for the lovers; Roxanne, for de jealousy; Diamonds are the girls best friends, for the materialism of Satine, and many more. I don't mind the anachronism, and I believe that, with a little imagination, everyone can even enjoy it. The actors are splendid in their roles and as a singers, the costumes and art direction are precious (the elephant and the gothic tower are very original sets), the musical moments provokes high and magical feelings and amazing climax (through the use of an accelerated camera operations, but in this case the finality justifies methods). Those things make it so great.</fullReview>

At first I didn't think I would like it, even though I am a sucker for a musical and a good love story. And, as viewers already know, this is a story about love. The classic "boy-gets-girl, or does he?" story with some exciting twists and turns and laughs and tears along the way. I was pleasantly surprised by Nicole Kidman's and Ewan McGregor's voices. They were beautiful (on the eyes too lol). I'll never listen to "Your Song" quite the same way again. "Come What May" makes me wish I was getting married all over again so I could have that as my wedding song. I'm speechless at this point except to say, see this movie- if you haven't already. And if you have- go see it again! Buy the DVD! The additional material is incredible! I got it for Christmas and I've watched it so many times my cat is singing the soundtrack with me!

		<fullReview>I know that people and critics alike loved this movie. I just can't figure out why!OK. There is a bittersweet love story here - if you can fight your way through the innane first twenty minutes or so. But there's nothing particularly original to it. The high-class prostitute (Nicole Kidman) falls for the poor boy (Ewan McGregor), but has "responsibilities" to the more upper-class man in her life. The thing is dull. It's transparent almost from the beginning. We know how this is going to end. Does it have any redeeming qualities? OK - a couple.Good music. Mostly 80's stuff, but some going as far back as the Beatles. Although, I found the 80's music put into the context of a show in 1900 a bit disconcerting. Still, good selection of music. And the movie should be watched if only to see Zidler and the Duke (Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh respectively) do their rendition of Madonna's "Like A Virgin." That did have me laughing, I admit. But I really thought that, overall, this was a rather poor attempt to blend a musical comedy with a Greek tragedy.I'm told that the 1944 version was far superior. Perhaps I'll watch that someday.4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything You Could Possibly Want In A Movie Reinvented and Served Up Hot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge has taken it's place at the top of my favourite movies of all time. It makes me lift my skirt above my head and show my knickers to the world it's so wonderful. It has so much packed into it, and it's all combined skillfully by brilliant director/writer Baz Luhrmann. Comedy, music, singing, tragedy, amazing costumes, beautiful sets, amazing special effects, a fast paced and consistant tone, sexuality, violence, brilliant acting, beautiful people, a 360 world of truth, beauty, freedom and love. It will leave you with feelings I can't even describe in words.The most amazing thing about this movie is that you notice something new everytime you watch it. That's been my experience, in any case. There is just so much to see, that even after seeing it 15, yes, 15 times I still notice something new. For example, did you notice that when Satine and Zidler come out from the girl's dresses after changing that Zidler is actually in his underwear? Took me 15 times to notice. He's covering his naughty bits and everything.Nicole Kidman is amazing. Ewan McGregor is brilliant. They are truly two very talented people who deserve all the recognition in the world.Of course I love this film. Having said that, it's very true that this is one of those love it or hate it films. Some people cannot stand this movie. It's either one or the other big extreme of enjoyment of this film, and I haven't met anyone who has fallen in the middle of loving/hating the movie at the same time. People get snagged on the simplicity of the plotline. See below about the "red curtain" filmmaking style. Keep in mind you may just hate it, and it's a personal thing. But keep in mind that I will hate you for hating this movie. Oops. Did I say that? This sentiment, however, is shared with many. People are so attached to this film that anyone who just didn't like it "just because" become absolute morons in the Rougehead's eyes.I cannot reccommend this movie enough. You must see Moulin Rouge. It is so different from everything out there. This "red curtain" style of filmmaking that Luhrmann embraces (placing a simple plot in a heightened world) is a truly magnificent thing. He's done it before (Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliette) but never on this level. See it and learn from what it brings to the medium of filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I picked up Moulin Rouge at the rental store thinking "What the heck? At least I can say I saw it," thinking it wouldn't be that good. Boy was I wrong! I should have known I would fall hopelessly in love with the movie. Baz Luhrman(director, most well known for his direction of Romeo and Juliet) is a genius seeing scenes and putting them together in a way that no one else would have done. The editing is fantastic and really brings out so much emotion whether it is happy, sad, or hilarious. I have never really seen many Nicole Kidman films but this has given me a whole new respect for her and I am a fan for life. She is a remarkably talented actress from every word to every blink. Her facial expressions can stir emotions inside you that you never knew were there. You could always tell what she was feeling and she made it very apparent when she was Satine the actress and Satine the woman in love. I was so surprised to hear how wonderfully she sings and never thought I would have a "Nicole Kidman CD" I can't say enough good things about her performance. I have seen a few films starring Ewan McGregor and loved every one of them, this one tops the cake. As the naive man in love with a woman everyone wants, he is so wonderful and his voice makes him that much more. (if I say anything else great about his performance I will spoil the movie) Kidman and McGregor have fantastic on-screen chemistry causing that wonderful warm fuzzy feeling ("it's a little bit funny this feeling inside") whenever they are together in the scenes. This is a picture you never want to end but it does and all you can do is rewind and watch it over and over again. Any film that does a music mix of "Lady Marmalade" and "Smells Like Teen Spirit" gets a 10+ in my book. This isn't a movie for everyone, but for those of you who love great music, true love, and an all around craziness complete with a new cover of "Like a Virgin" you will be happily surprised with the masterpiece of Moulin Rouge! which in my opinion will be a classic that people will be enjoying for a million years to come. "It's spectacular spectacular, no word from your vernacular... So exc-i-ting the audience will stop and cheer, so de-light-ing it will run for 50 years!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantasia of sight and sound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was interesting to me and possessed a kind of quixotic charm, once I had got used to the frenetic noise and motion. It's very original and a hard film to classify, lying somewhere between a cartoon and an opera. Some of the music--cribbed from diverse sources--is very beautiful, particularly a rendering of "The Show Must Go On" by the character Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent) and a chorus of seamstresses.The introductory musical theme--based on "Nature Boy" from an old movie "The Boy With the Green Hair"--is a haunting and unforgettable melody made popular by Nat "King" Cole in the late 1940s. "Moulin Rouge" seems to want to pursue some obscure parallel with that earlier film by the use of green lighting on Christian's (Ewan McGregor's) own hair during one of the reprises, though I'm bound to say I couldn't detect much similarity between the two characters. (I watched it a second time to see whether there were any other such allusions, but if so, they were over my head.)Nicole Kidman does a fine acting job. She is an exquisitely beautiful "Satine" and shows great courage, if perhaps not the best judgment, in singing her own songs. But that's okay; the movie is, after all, a celebration of "truth" (and better this than the abomination of Eliza Doolittle's dubbing). McGregor's singing voice, on the other hand, is a most pleasant surprise--somebody, give him a Grammy or something.If you can overlook the noise and the freaked-out kinetics, and you don't require realism in effects or story, you might just like this flick very much. It offers two beautiful protagonists, some comic touches, and lots of heart. It's worth a look, and better the second time around.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film proves that musicals are NOT dead!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected this movie would be good, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out this movie wasn't just 'good'...it was great...fantastic...absolutely excellent! Growing up in musical theater, I've always had a great respect for musicals, but I was also aware that in this day and age, musicals don't usually fly with the public like they used to. It seems to have become an era where "reality" entertainment is what people want to see, but this movie shows that the old fashioned musicals and fantasies are still alive and well. This film was obviously done right. It had the traditional musical movie aspects of it, but it also included modern music in its score, which made it appealing to the younger crowd. Like a long "MTV" music video, but without getting away from the charm of such a genre. Not only were the musical score, the actors and the sets excellent, but it was such a great story. I'm not exactly into the mushy love stories, but I found myself getting lost in the movie...like I was there..and that IMO is the purpose of films and television; to escape our everyday lives for a little while. Obviously this film was successful in doing that. It's nice to know that in the age of 'reality' TV shows and programming, that a film such as 'Moulin Rouge' still works, and we still have the opportunity to see a movie that we can get lost in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the "curtain" rise with the conductor I wasn't really sure what to do so I screamed. I knew that I was infatuated just by its strangely creative beginning. Just like the impressive awe you feel at the beginning of the Royal Tenenbaums (But don't confuse the two).Moulin Rouge is a story about extreme freedom although several from my parents' generation have called it "decedent". I think it is the guts of many a creative mind thrown out together very nicely. My only reserve are the sexual jokes. But for the year 2001 and heck, for the past ten years, I applaud Moulin Rouge. Yeahhhhhh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say that would do this film justice? The colors are stunning, the vibrant shades, the deep shadows. I've been a Baz Luhrman fan since R&amp;J, but this movie really blew me away. The four words: Freedom, Beauty, Truth, and Love are expressed flawlessly in each song. The movie is an emotional rollercoaster, driving you to laughter and tears, as few movies can. All the vocalists do an incredible job, and the actors never falter in their characters. Every time I see it I get drawn in. The story, though simple has a timeless and effortless beauty. (Everyone falls in love, and the loss of it is the most painful thing there is, just as love itself is the most beautiful thing there is.) "Moulin Rouge!" makes my previous statement, only a thousand times more artfully. Kudos to all involved for putting something so incredible into the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first rented this film I was worried that it would be awful. To some members of my family it was . My grandpa walked out after 5 Minutes which was sad because it was a very moving movie. The story revolves around a English writer who falls in love with French prostitute who works at the lavish nightclub The Moulin Rouge. The problem is that she is supposed to belong to a rich duke. That is basically the plot . The music is very good and lovely at certain points. So if you haven't seen it please do and if you have see it again You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>30 Second Bottom Line: A struggling writer falls in love with a nightclub singer/dancer/courtesan and becomes thwarted in developing the relationship by the desires of a powerful and wealthy man holding the title of Duke, and ultimately by her illness.Moulin Rouge is not simply a film, but rather a fantastical affair filled with music, drama, action, and most importantly, love. Moulin Rouge allows you to take a trip to the 19th century Paris hot spot for the price of a movie ticket. It's a musical play set with the stage background reminiscent of The Grinch. for adults. That is to say we see real people against a fairy tale backdrop, performing nearly impossible stunts to the tune of contemporary pop music. Although the story takes place in the arty section of Paris known is Mormantre, it was filmed entirely down under in Australia. The costumes are wonderful, just as they were when we saw Jim Broadbent in Topsy Turvy. In that film, the setting, costumes and music were 19th century. Here, the setting is 19th century, yet the music spans the last 30 years; with songs you will recognize such as Like a Virgin, Rhythm of the Night, Material Girl and Lady Marmalade. It may sound crazy, but director Luhrmann brings it all together just as he did with Strictly Ballroom.Usually clichés make me groan, but in this case, they fit in perfectly. The phrases from popular songs are used in the dialogue as the characters are speaking to one another and it sounds like a funny type of Shakespeare where you really know what they are talking about. It's also hilarious to listen to because it's like talking to someone with bits and pieces of songs that you've heard a thousand times.Over the top, energetic and extravagant musical numbers, as well as tender solos make Moulin Rouge soar. When Lady Marmalade was being done, I'm sure that although Patti Labelle was not on the screen, she would be proud of what they did with her song. It's somewhat like Gwyneth Paltrow and Huey Lewis singing Cruisin in the film Duets. They sounded great and would give the man himself, Smokey Robinson, a run for his money on its performance. Who would have thought that Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor can sing well enough to make you want to buy the CD?! Elton John says, regarding Ewan's performance of Your Song, "This guy sings this song better than I sing it." Word is that Ewan is working on getting a recording contract. I think it will happen.he's that good!Moulin Rouge is a spectacle that keeps you breathless because it moves so fast. You see so much, you hear so much and you think so much about the story and its eccentric characters that you can't help but enjoy so much. There are at least three or four times I had to restrain myself from applauding after a musical number. This is one film that deserves a standing ovation.Message: Life is nothing without true love.As the conclusion this movie is really the best musical movie of Year 2001 and you would feel sorry yourself if you do actually miss this elegant and vivid masterpiece from Baz Luhrmann!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPATACULAR! SPACTACULAR!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few movies have affected me like Moulin Rouge. I must admit, when my wife and I sat in the theater, during the first 20 minutes, I sat there in utter amazment, and dizzy, but found myself in a trance that I wasn't ready yet to wake up from. I was held captive by the quick editing, the colorful costumes, and the flashing images that sped past my eyes faster than Superman could EVER fly. But I was HOOKED! And then, the story started and it got even better.This is INDEED a love-it-or-hate-it film. I can understand why several people can't stand it, it isn't going to appeal to everyone, but I on the other hand, took it all in, and I "GOT IT." I loved the music that was chosen, I loved the set design, I loved the directing, and the cinematography. I have never been a big Nichole Kidman fan, but this film has opened my eyes to how talented she really is, and for an unprofessional, I thought she sang GREAT! I was even more awaked by her talent in THE OTHERS, but that's for another post.Ethan was SUPRISING as Christian, who knew That Luke Skywalkers mentor could sing so well.I saw this one 3 times in the theater, and countless times on video so far. I am SOOOOOO late in returning it to Blockbuster, I don't want to let it go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular Spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Spectacular Spectacular' is the name of the musical-within-the-musical, and it absolutely describes the film itself. I have been a fan of Baz Luhrmann's Red Curtain films (Strictly Ballroom and Romeo &amp; Juliet), but this is by far the best of the three. The film is so beautifully shot, it truly is a feast for the eyes. The frenzied pace of the editing gives the audience a feeling of the frenzied pace of the bohemian life. The costumes and sets are amazing and colorful and passionate and provocative. They are bawdy without being tacky. The dance numbers are very well choreographed and very well executed, especially the tango sequence. Luhrmann's direction, along with the editing, make the numbers fit in to the story naturally, helping to tell the story, without the typical `song and dance' feel of traditional musicals. The music is mixed and scored very well, fitting in modern music to a timeless story. The one original song, `Come What May,' is beautiful and haunting. I've had it stuck in my head for weeks. Kidman's and McGregor's voices compliment each other, blending in the harmonies and standing out in the solos. The story is hilarious one minute and heart-breaking the next. The script is wonderfully written, with dialogue that is easy to understand yet not contemporary. But the performances make this film what it is. Nicole Kidman is luminous as Satine, the Sparkling Diamond. She is a beautiful, tragic, fabulous heroine who sings like an angel (who knew?). As for Ewan McGregor, the word that best describes him is YUMMY. I had no idea he had such a powerful voice, and the range of emotion he shows in this film is incredible. The chemistry between these two is fantastic. You can almost feel the love they share and the pain they feel. Jim Broadbent is larger than life as Zidler. John Leguizamo, of whom I am not a fan, is impressive as Toulouse-Lautrec. Richard Roxburgh steals every scene he is in. Watch him closely when he is not the main focus of the scene (`My dear, a little frog!'). His body language and facial expressions are hysterical. This film is visually stunning, emotionally titillating, moving, stirring, and just plain good entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just can't get enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scanning through all the comments it would seem that movie-goers either hate it or love it. Baz Luhrmann, himself, did say it was a bit much for some. Fortunately for me I can't get enough of it. (I love what someone earlier in the comments said about Moulin Rouge being "trippy." They hit it right on the head) Though, I can't say I was gushing over it when I first viewed it. At first I was a bit skeptical because of the cheesy medlies, but soon after began to let go and started to enjoy myself. Like all Luhrmann's films it was a rush-walking out of the theater felt like getting off the rollercoaster. All the colors, music, and plain'ol brashness of the Moulin Rouge helped to balance out the tendency towards sappiness (which I liked). The wonderful thing about Moulin Rouge is that every time I see it I gain a deeper appreciation for it. It's art. (also I was really impressed with the singing too-especially Ewan Mcgregor's voice). I got the two-disc DVD set for Christmas and was just blown away. It was so much fun to sit there and just play around with everything Luhrmann had added to the movie. Hey, as far as I'm concerned, Moulin Rouge is the best thing that's happened to DVD so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Moulin Rouge came out I did not want to see it because of that 'Lady Marmalade' video that played constantly on MTV and local radio stations. I believed that the movie would be the same pathetic thing; whores trying to carry a favorable tune but end up coming out with a "pop" song.I made a mistake. I waited until video even after reading rave reviews and seeing it on the TOP 250 list. I originaly went to rent Scary Movie 2 just so I could come on here and give it a bad review. But while entering blockbuster a big Moulin Rouge sign stole my eyes and I decided to rent it instead. The movie began kind of dull, the first 10 minutes weren't good. I have to say that because I want to tell you the truth. But gradually the movie began to progress and I began to love every minute of it. The music was brilliant! Ewan McGregger and Nicole Kidman are wonderful! There voices are mature and blend wonderfully together. The music was irresistible. It's catchy AND likeable. My favorite would have to be thier version of 'Roxanne.' But not only was the plot, acting, and music perfect but the setting was amazing! It was surreal an romantic. I loved everything about it and that includes the singing moon. In all this movie was one of the best romances of all time. I believe it's right up thier with Gone with the Wind and Titanic. And definetly one of the best musicals of all time, most certainly the best in the last two decades. In fact I loved it so much I went out and bought the CD and the DVD! See it, it's spectacular! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nausiatingly Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I'm going to get hate mail for this review. "Moulin Rouge" is just one of those movies. Everybody just adores it, and you're stuck there thinking "what?" Sure, I could see where everybody's coming from. Love story, good production values, pop songs, and all that jazz. But "Moulin Rouge" is a movie that is as easy to despise as it is to love.The premise is simple. Take a whole bunch of pop music, plop it in the middle of a turn-of-the-century atmosphere and stick in a love story. Some would say such simple words wouldn't be enough to describe this film, but really, that's all it is. "Moulin Rouge" seems more like a reason for a soundtrack than a film.Ewan McGregor is Christian, an aspiring poet traveling to France for inspiration. Little does he know, inspiration will without a doubt come his way soon, in the form of Satine (Nicole Kidman), a popular courtesan working in the Moulin Rouge. He instantly falls in love, but of course, he can't live happily ever after with her ("The only way of lovin' me, baby, is to pay a lovely fee!") And Satine has other plans for her future than spending it with Christian, and as her dreams to become an actress start to turn into reality, the greedy Duke of Monroth tries to bind her exclusively to him. So, take this, throw in "Smells Like Teen Spirit", "Like A Virgin" and more, and what do you get? A ludicrous fiasco that's not even fun enough to be a sequel to "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" (yes, that IS a movie...)For a while in the beginning, the film is a joy to watch. But this lasts only a few minutes, for as the story starts to develop, the film stops having fun with itself and begins to set up a serious, dramatic mood. That would work if this was any other movie. But in "Moulin Rouge", the utter ridiculousness of the placement of pop songs undermines anything notable. In the first scenes, I smiled when Christian randomly blurts out "The Sound of Music" and "All You Need is Love". Very quickly, however, I was getting tired of all the oo-la-la. By the time Zidler (Jim Broadbent) is singing "Like A Virgin", I was laughing at them, not with them. And don't even mention the ill-timed musical number set to "Roxanne".I have to admit though, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman certainly do have the pipes to carry out the job. They sing with passion (the same can't be said about a certain Mariah Carey) and truly bring out some spirit in the middle of all the chaos. It's too bad the film is such a pain, because they give performances worthy of recognition. The rest of the cast seems like they're having a good time, which does make the film slide along a little easier."Moulin Rouge" starts with an idea that something could be done with. However, director Baz Luhrmann sells-out completely, completely giving his movie up for commercial success. There is really little inspiration after the first shots, and the premise might be able to sustain for two hours if the way it was carried out wasn't so gag-inducing. Quick note to Mr. Luhrmann: it's a very bad sign when you're is laughing so hard during dramatic moments that at the end, your friend turns to you and suggests you leave "before the people in the back start shooting".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS! I just love original movies that are made by professionals that are willing to take a chance. Any idiot can buy some dynamite and blow things up, capture it on film and call it a movie. It's been done thousands of times, and I'm tired of it. This movie was a welcome diversion from Hollywood's usual rehashed stuff. Like a lot of people, I thought "MTV clone" during the first 15 minutes. After the film settled down, I was mesmerized by the performances of not only the stars Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor, but the supporting cast as well. Each supporting actor seemed to be the right fit for their respective parts. The recurring sentiment of "The show must go on" spoke volumes about the struggles of everyday life, and the resolve people have to overcome obstacles. I thought that using modern music worked sometimes, and didn't work at other times, but overall, I can't think of anything that I would change. My wife got the DVD for Christmas, and after we watched it twice, and it's going around the circuit to friends who wanted to see it, too. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Even if you don't like musicals, give this one a try at least once. Like us, you may be quite surprised and were glad that you took the plunge into a film that is visually stunning and quite unique.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie of 2001. The sets, the acting, the singing, the costumes ... My God, it's so damn good! Goes to show you that a musical can still make it today's world. And who knew that Nicole and Ewan could really sing? I was never much of a Nicole Kidman fan before. Now I can't get enough of her. See this movie, twice!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first rented this DVD I thought it was a movie. You know, with no singing! I had heard little of the movie but I know I loved the song that was on the radio "Lady Marmalade" - But to my suprise it was soooo much more than a movie. It was a spectacular musical !!!! I love musicals and this is now one of my favorites. This is a must see for musical lovers ... trust me, you will be addicted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not being a fan of musicals, I was rather unsure about this film. But when I heard that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman were in it, I thought that it deserved a chance. After hearing the rave reviews from friends, I finally sat down and watched this puppy. Mindblowing! It's the only way to describe the movie. Beautifully filmed, with romance and music that tugged my heartstrings in all the right ways. The performances by McGregor and Kidman were dead-on and Jim Broadbent was pure genius. Plus, that Unconscious Argentinian was quite funny. Sit down and watch this movie, you'll be glad you did.Cheers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to see "Moulin Rouge" it was with the greatest of expectations. I had been told beforehand from one of my friends that he had seen it more than 10 times when he was living overseas. Then it opened in Denmark and I got tickets for the opening night. I made sure that I didn't know anything about the movie except: Baz Luhrmann, Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman and John Leguizamo. What I saw was quite simply put, fantastic. Baz Luhrmann's talent for creating the most beautiful images is hardly surpassed by any living director. Every frame of this movie is full of imaginative details, beautiful colors, and fantastic settings. The simple story of love is narrated quite cleverly by the use of modern songs like: "Smells like teen spirit", "Nature Boy" and "Heroes", even though the story takes place in 1899. Craig Armstrong's score is really fantastic, and the way the songs are mixed seamlessly is beyond comprehension. The movie has it's minor flaws, but none that disturbs the movie or becomes irritating. I can not say it enough times, watch this movie if you have an enormous love of music, and if you like being swept away visually. If not, this movie is not for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Immerse yourself in Emotion- Spectacular film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This story is about love...the woman I loved is.....dead." That's the first line of this film, and sets the tone.This is a better movie than I imagined. It sells itself as a colorful drama, but it's a musical through and through. It's officially a TragiComiDramaMusical, or that's what the critics call it, but it gets to your heartstrings and senses and kicks them.Baz Luhrmann had a theory for this film, that music and razzle dazzle and color will create a heightened experience, and it worked. People may pay more attention to it for it's astounding technical abilities, but I was mainly captivated by it's music, acting, and it's storyline. Not to say I didn't like the color and razor sharp editing, quite the contrary. I was purely amazed at what they achieved. But that they could go over that and send a clear cut and emotional story with superb acting, is something you rarely see in any "super charged" films.The story is loosely based on the Greek Tragedy about Orhpeus. It revolves around the young Christian (Ewan McGregor) who enters the world of the Moulin Rouge and Montmarte to become a great writer. He befriends some strange Bohemians and is assigned to write a show for the MR called "Spectacular! Spectacular!". He has to recruit the courtesan Satine, but falls in love with her. Eventually they both become enmeshed in their love for each other, the dirty and treacherous goings on of the MR, and the making of the show. After betrayal and intrigue, the film ends with a tragic ending you knew was coming from Christian's first line: "This story is about love...the woman I loved is.....dead."The acting is much better than I expected. People had been talking about how Kidman could get a Oscar nomination for her performance in this, but I had thought "Why? It's a musical. There's no such thing as good acting in musicals." Nicole shines. She goes through several stages in the film and is always believable at the level she chooses. Especially in her TB scenes, where she plays sick, she does a very unglamorous and ugly portrayal of the disease. She does comedy and seduction and heroism in one role, and it's not at all cliche. McGregor particularly surprised me. I had known he was a good actor, but not as good as he is in this film. He also goes through stages, and pulls it off with his ability to act completly natural. He's by far one of the best natural actors I've ever seen, and some of his body language and facial gestures do the role a great deal of good. It's hard to act "innocent" without getting terribly annoying, and he's never annoying, but maybe because he's more of a decent and kind character than the stereotypical "innocent". Supporting characters shine, and John Leguizamo deserves a thumbs up for a particularly painful but strong performance (if you hear how they shortened him). Jim Broadbent, who plays the enabling and sweet pimp Zidler (it's tough to call him that, but that's what he is), is fantastic, and Richard Roxborough who plays the Duke, is notorious and does a wonderful job at being completely and one hundred percent devious.This movie shines, and it addicts you. Many people have said you either love it or hate it, and I'd say it's true. It will either overwhelm you, or you'll like it for all it is. It's supposed to be overboard. It's supposed to have that "If it exists we'll use it just because." That's the whole point. It's a beautiful film, and it's very true, it follows how life works. There are people who'll be bad to you, and people who will love you, and not everything works as you want it. It's supposed to be an experience, not just a date at the movies. Ever wonder why they have the "!" at the end of the film? You have to see it, then you can't say it any other way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An eye-popping, attention-grabbing piece of work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MOULIN ROUGE (2001) Rating: 9/10Director and co-writer (with Craig Pearce) Baz Luhrmann describes the style he brought to the Australian dance flick Strictly Ballroom and his underrated take on William Shakespeare's Romeo &amp; Juliet as "red curtain theatricality." He likes to deal with familiar types of stories (so the audience knows how it will end) taking place in sort of a heightened reality, with plenty of devices reminding the audience that they're watching a movie. Moulin Rouge! is a perfect example of that. It's not interested in the banal and the realistic, it's Cinema!!, with a capital 'C' and plenty of exclamation points! Music! Flying colors! Dancing! Emotions set free! Slapstick! LOVE! The red curtain opens (literally) and then we're off for one wild ride, a rocky electric cancan boogie playing over a love rollercoaster, as seen through the lenses of a filmmaker with a vision equal parts Mélics, Technicolor 1950s musicals and MTV.It's quite overwhelming at first, but in a good way. Luhrmann's frenetic back and forth camerawork puts you in the same state of mind as Christian as he enters the Moulin Rouge for the first time. On one side powdered girls are doing their thing, chanting the "Voulez-Vous couchez avec moi?" chorus from "Lady Marmelade," while across the way a bunch of men in tuxedos are emulating Kurt Cobain and proclaiming "Here we are now, entertain us...," meanwhile Zigler is screaming "Because you can can can!" on Fatboy Slim's electronic beats... And then Satine floats down on a trapeze crooning "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friends" and takes everybody's breath away... The men's, Christian's... Ours.That's another thing; it's good to be able to craft energetic, entertaining musical numbers, but there's the danger to end up with a futile, purposeless costume revue. This never happens here because, as familiar and melodramatic as the story can be, it still involves us completely. We really feel for these passionate lovers doomed to hide their affair. When we see Satine for the first time, we fall in love with her along with Christian, and we root for him, for them, through the rest of the film. The delightfully twisted musical numbers that punctuate their tale aren't gratuitous but integral to the drama. Most every important declaration is made through song, be it Christian belting out Elton John's "Your Song" ("How wonderful life is while you're in the world...") or Satine serenading him with "Come What May" (one of the movie's few originals, and a great one at that - expect an Oscar nomination), or the both of them discoursing about love with lyrics from famous songs from The Beatles, Kiss, David Bowie, Paul McCartney, Joe Cocker, Whitney Houston. Plus, not only to the songs fit in thematically, they're also reinvented in original ways. The Police's "Roxane" becomes a tango, Madonna's "Like a Virgin" becomes a show tune...Then there's the outrageous sets and costumes, the frantic choreography, the endless variety of camera angles and editing tricks... And above all, love, as communicated by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in what could be career peaks for both. Kidman is just lovable, sexy, warm and goofy, nothing like the icy bombshell she once appeared to be. McGregor is at the other end of the spectrum from diving into toilets, all charm and idealism, love obsessed writer, blue-eyed dreamer... And when put together, extraordinary chemistry erupts, they just gel together, they BELONG with one another! And they can sing too! Who knew these two had such nice voices? They're nicely surrounded by a cast of enjoyably caricatural supporting characters, from John Leguizamo's high-on-absinthe dwarf to Jim Broadbent's life of the party burly man and Roxburgh' mustache-twirling Snidely Whiplash of a villain.Moulin Rouge! is what film lovers have been waiting for all year. There have been some good movies here and there in the past year, and even one or two great ones, but this is something else. Here's a movie that makes you giddy with joy and eager to see it again and again. Spectacular Spectacular indeed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Moulin Rouge" could be a perfect example of what a typical filmmaker might do with the enormous budget, sets, costumes, and big-name stars, but it truly transcends any handicaps which lurk in the film's typical romantic storyline.Nicole Kidman (in a role she was born to play) portrays Satine, the most expensive courtesan in the Bohemian burlesque house known as the Moulin Rouge (1890 Paris). Ewan MacGregor plays Cristian, the naive young poet who falls trulymadlydeeply in love with Satine after seeing her perform "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend."The best thing about this film, with its hyperkenetic pace and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder style of editing (courtesy of director Baz Luhrman [William Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet"]), is its sheer production magnitude, and some truly astounding musical performances, for which MacGregor and Kidman are to be commended. Although, after the film holds its pace well, in the middle 40 minutes or so, the pace begins to drag, but what keeps the blah story afloat is the wonderful music. Director Luhrman has taken contemporary pop songs (with contemporary beats) and featured them in this epic tale of love and Parisian culture.However, while viewing, the viewer certainly gets the sense that if it weren't for the fact that the film comes in a pretty package, packed with some walloping music, it would be just another typical love story. This factor prevents it from receiving a superior rating, but it's a great movie for lovers of cabaret.Rating: *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expressionism, Anyone?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Expressionistic art BY DESIGN brings attention to it's artificiality. Even though many films use expressionistic elements ("Tom Jones," "A Hard Days Night," "Airplane," "The Naked Gun), I've seen only four films could genuinely be classified as "expressionistic films:" "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari," Fellini's "Never Bet the Devil Your Head, Mel Brooks' "Blazing Saddles" and now "Moulin Rouge," which is the LEAST successful of the four. The other films used expressionism to reinforce their themes. However, unless writer/ director Baz Luhrman INTENDED an antiromantic picture (which I believe he did), his self-conscious, anachronistic artifices work AGAINST the main plot (i.e., the love story between the poor writer and the doomed cabaret singer). While incredibly beautiful and dreamlike (Oscar worthy cinematography, set decoration, art direction, editing and sound) and boasting great performances by Nicole Kidman and Jim Broadbent, the main plot is uninvolving, the characters uninteresting and the film is ultimately unsatisfying.Possible Spoilers:I have several reasons for believing the film is MEANT to be antiromantic. Ewan McGregor's dialogue is chock full of "modern" "romantic" musical lyrics, integrated in a manner assured to bring laughter. The love songs between Kidman and McGregor, while lovely, all appear to be done tongue in cheek. As McGregor "sobs" over Kidman's lifeless body, he appears to be guffawing. Baz Luhrman could have made his point complete if he'd included a "lovers singing while walking in the clouds" sequence at the end of the movie. Alas, I was left unclear as exactly what WERE his intentions. Oh well, perhaps that's on Disk 2 of the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really loved this movie. I had no interest in getting up for anything during this movie. I can't say how long I have been looking for a movie that reflects my interest and taste. It's been a REAL long time. The only thing that usually comes close is a Cohen Brothers production or foreign.I remember reading reviews when this first came out in the theatres that you are either going to love or hate this movie. I can see why. This is very much done in a theatrical style rather than cinematic. The fourth wall and distance in locale are ignored, so if you aren't familiar and comfortable with that stage technique, you will find yourself confused. Think fantasy, not reality.I loved the music. Again, you will often hear that it contains covers of pop music. However, they are done in musical theatre style. So if you don't like musical theatre, don't bother. Also if you tend to be a bit fanatical about covers.The costumes and art direction are top notch. But, they contain the surrealism of the theatre. So, if you have a real aversion to high art, skip it.In a nutshell, if you are looking to see a Julia Roberts movie, rent one. This isn't it. But. if you are looking for something a little deeper and artistic, see "Moulin Rouge!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* WARNING: CONTAINS A small SPOILER (but this movie is not really about the story anyway, so it probably does not matter :) ) *Moulin Rouge is all about style and appearance. But what style! The wonderful way the movie is executed makes it incredibly, breathtakingly, enjoyable, despite having a rather pedestrian love story as its "plot".To be analytical, the basic story: a theatre making a story about two lovers with an interfering rich third man, by a cast living through the same experience, is nothing new. Old idea, but good. The fact that the heroine dies at the end might be strange to American audiences, but is the only reasonable way to finish the movie, without really solving the "problem" of a rich lover and poor loved. Anyway, this movie lives from its style. The way in which popular songs are used, using lyrics not written for this particular movie as if they were an original musical score, is brilliant. Each song has its own set of connotations, due to the group who first made it popular and the trends it belonged to, and these connotations sometimes make the whole experience quite sublime. The start, where Nirvana's "Smells like teen spirit" is intervowen with Patti LaBelles "Lady marmalade" is just plain genius! The use of "Sound of Music" is hilarious. You wait and wait for Queens "The Show Must go On", and finally it comes. Elton John's lyrics for "Your Song" are really allowed to mean something more... "Like a Virgin" is a crazy take on the Madonna music video, and the list just goes on and on and on!The visuals are often stunning, and the way is which realism is completely ignored just adds to the fun (I believe it was a bottles thrown out of a window is made to bounce on the Eiffel tower :) ). There is a cartload of slapstick thrown in, like the cartoonish climbing of the elephant by Toulouse Lautrec, or the way in which an unconscious actor falls through the hero's roof at the start. Just wonderful!Never mind the hero blabbing along about "love is everything": anything else would be utterly at odds with the strong colors and high volume of the movie! This is not about being realistic or believable, but about being entertaining! Never mind that the end is given at the start of the movie: that is part of the drama!All in all, a movie that is a jumble of wonderful scenes set to fantastic music, and with a thread of a plot that is just thick and dramatic enough to carry it all through. See it!</fullReview>

If you saw the video for the "Lady Marmalade" song, you have a very vague idea of what you're in for (by the way, the movie is a lot smarter than the video suggests). Just make sure you watch it when you're good and alert cause there's more stuff going on in any given frame of film here than some movies have in their entire running length.This is a movie you're either going to passionately love or violently hate, but don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original and Over the Top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is a daring, over the top film that does not spare any amount of excess, take itself at all seriously or stick to any movie conventions. It could have ended up a wretched exercise in self indulgence and overkill, but instead emerges a modern classic. There are many vastly varying comments on this film. Some disparage the plot line for its simplicity and lack of originality. To these people I say rent the DVD, read about the film and watch it closely. It was absolutely intended to be a simple love story told through the medium of song. (This completes Baz Luhrmann's previous efforts, telling a love story through dance in Strictly Ballroom and spoken word in Romeo and Juliette). Some also did not like the reused music. This is something you will either love or hate. I loved it, particularly because they chose my wedding song (Elton John's Your Song) as the key song of the love story, ever-so-slightly re-written. If the Elephant Love Medley does not put a smile on your face, then you are in desperate need of a long holiday.The movie is brilliantly cast with Nicole Kidman as Santine, the courtesan who breaks her greatest vow, never to fall in love, Ewan McGregor as Christain, the "penniless writer" who believes that love is life's greatest gift and Richard Roxbough, who makes the film with his role as the insanely jealous Duke trying to buy Santine's affections.Will love win over money? Will Santine and Christain finally admit their feelings? Will the Duke be shunned? Will the show go on? Is the Pope catholic? These questions are not important to the movie's success. The screen is crammed with images and action, every dance number leaves nothing on the table and it is all played bursting with life. I loved this movie.Nicole Kidman is at the peak of her career here, carrying this ambitious film on her shoulders. As beautiful as any woman on Earth, she is a delight to watch as her character effortlessly transforms from performer to lover to seductress to businesswoman to ailing patient. She covers every range, sings, dances and looks perfect. An Oscar is not unreasonable, and no nomination would be a crime.See this film. Leave your plot-following, analytical senses at the door and go along for the ride. This is one of the best films of the past 10 years. **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is great to watch! The sets are amazing and very well done, the costumes are fantastic and the acting is first rate! Moulin Rouge is crazy, but in a very fun way. There is so much going on, all the actors are outgoing and the dancing and singing is so lively and the acting is so natural. The entire movie is fun and it's a splash of color, it is everywhere you look. Nicole Kidman does such a great job portraying all the emotions her character has and she sings so well. The fact that it's a musical didn't bother me, the movie isn't swamped with songs, but they are put in select scenes that work very, very well. Moulin Rouge is a fun movie to watch, the type you can enjoy every time you watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best comparison to make between this and another movie isShakespeare in Love. Like the deserving Academy Award winner,Moulin Rouge features a play within a play where the writter falls inlove with someone out of his reach. The problem is that thismovie doesn't have the proper pacing. Partly because of it'ssetting in the Paris Bohemian underworld, it is a constant rush ofimages through much of it that is just painful to watch andoverworks the senses to the point the brain isn't prepared to takein the finer points. Watching through the first hour I was sotempted to just turn the film off as it hadn't pulled me in, somethinga good movie should accomplish in much less time. It seemsthis film has had as much a split review from the critics as any andit seems so for good reason. As much promise that might bethere convincing some to like it, there are problems that convinceothers not to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Complete Showstopper!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got this movie for Christmas and watched it four times in two days. Then I watched the director's commentary, the behind the red curtain featurette, the making of..., the star interviews, the HBO special, the music videos, and the promotional material before watching the whole thing again for a fifth time. And then I bought the soundtrack.What I'm getting at here is that you'll either hate this movie or become obsessed with it. The movie is a package of brillant colors, whimsical costumes, catchy showtunes, and heart-wrenching emotion. It takes place at the Moulin Rouge in Paris, 1899, at the height of the Bohemian era and dance-hall scenes. Nicole Kidman plays Satine, a courtesan and star of the shows; Ewan McGregor plays Christian, a penniless writer who falls in love with her. There's an evil duke, an opportunistic owner, a piano player with four hands, a green fairy (Kylie Minogue!), a narcoleptic actor, and the dwarf artist Toulouse-Latrec (Leguizamo, on his knees the entire time).If that weren't zany enough, the songs are modern songs reworked into a dance-club/showtune extravaganza. Christian stands on top of a 60-foot elephant, trying to convince Satine to love him, when all of a sudden he belts, "Feels a little bit fuuuunny, this feeling insiiiidee..." Did I just hear Elton John? Was the owner just singing to the duke "Like a Virgin"? I guarantee you'll get a chuckle out of a can-can version of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and a tango set to "Roxanne", which incidentally, involved 60 dancing couples. Bring it on!Director Baz Luhrmann explains that he likes to tell stories using a device; in his previous work it was through dance (Strictly Ballroom), iambic pentameter (Romeo+Juliet), and here in song. Who knew Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor could sing? And I mean really sing; there's more emotion in some of their 30-second ballads than in all of some movies. The film is as crazy as it sounds, with one second being entirely funny and the next tear-jerking. All of the characters are just that; the look and feel of this production takes you right to the Moulin Rouge of yesterday--it's like you are part of the play yourself. If I could sum up this flick in any other way, I'd compare it to hitting a big gaudy cinematic pinata and having all the great film tricks fall out; you'll find yourself surrounded by pure eye candy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely adored this movie!! I had heard great reviews from many people but had not seen it for myself till recently and I had to watch it again when it was finished! The story was touching and the spectacle was amazing! It was colourful and attention-holding! The songs were appropriate and humourous with interjections of "modern" songs in what was supposed to be a story that took place in 1899! The performances of Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman and John Leguizamo were incredible! The viewer must maintain a suspension of disbelief however, since this movie follows along the lines of a great musical... but to fall in love with this movie is what I have done, and as Ewan's character says... love is all you need!</fullReview>

There could have been a war going on around me while I was watching it and I wouldn't have noticed, I was so entranced.

		<fullReview>All I could think of was the old movies I watched growing up and what would have happened to them if they were turned into music videos. It's almost hard to describe without actually EXPERIENCING it. Take a hit of acid and then switch channels back and forth between Camille and Cabaret. Actually, that's not a bad thing! I was never bored and really enjoyed the sentiment behind the whole thing. There is a great sweetness disguised behind the lurid colors, camera work and oft told- cheesy love story. McGregor is awesome and steals the film. What a charmer he turns out to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was told, when my best friend took me to this movie, that I would either love it or hate it-there were no lukewarm feelings. As I sat in that theater, dazzled by the spectacular acting and music, and at that heartbreaking conclusion, I realized: I loved it. This movie is completely unique, like nothing else I've ever experienced. I personally did NOT like "Romeo + Juliet", but was still able to completely enjoy this movie. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are absolutely incredible-their passion and singing both amazed me, and I am in awe of their talents and hope to see a great deal more of both of their work. I am not here to insist that EVERYONE must see Moulin Rouge! but I would insist that everyone at least give it a chance, because it is a completely unique and dazzling experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Rouge brings the art of film to a new level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best films of the 90's and I will tell you why. First of all, one of the most important things to remember is that this is part of Baz Luhrmann's Red Curtain series (along with Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliet) in which he strives to make the audience aware that they are in fact watching a movie. He has used dancing, Shakespeare's language, and musical numbers in the three movies in the series respectively to do this. But Moulin Rouge does more. Luhrman creates a cinema in Moulin Rouge which is a feast for the eyes and a feast for the mind. He has an acute sense of spectacle in the piece. He takes the genre of "cinema" and moves it forward in. Saying that it's ok to make a musical in 2001, and ok to take the film in and out of fantasy whenever he wants. It's this pushing forward that makes the movie so great with new innovations in editing, sounds, graphics, and storytelling. It also helps that he had a fantastic cast including the wonderful talents of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, who not only perform well on an acting plane, but sing beautifully. Even their singing style does not imitate that of the classical musicals. It is the film of the future in many ways and it starts right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of razzle-dazzle, but where's the plot?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was totally enthralled by the first half hour of "Moulin Rouge." It's a pure razzle-dazzle, whiz-bang, spectacular spectacular with so much going on in each frame that your eyes scarcely know where to look. I began to think I was watching what would turn out to be my favorite movie of 2001.But razzle-dazzle can only hide the lack of a plot for so long. 45 minutes into the movie I began to look at my watch. And for the last hour I was reduced to simply hoping the movie would hurry up and end already.Oh, sure. It does have a plot. I guess. Unfortunately the plot is only a sappy love story that we already know the ending to. How do we know the ending? Because we are told it in the opening minute of the movie. Why are we told the ending at the beginning? That's a very good question.Still, "Moulin Rouge" is a spectacular looking, well acted bit of razzle-dazzle that almost swept me away. Oh, for a real plot! Oh, for a real villain, instead of the non-threatening Duke who we are supposed to hate and fear! Oh, for an ending that could have kept me guessing! Had "Moulin Rouge" had those things, it may very well have been picking up Oscar after Oscar come March.Instead, for me at least, it will remain only an intriguing curiosity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> Moulin Rouge is a spectacular piece of entertainment. Its fun,visually stunning and totally engrossing. I was a bit leary considering the fact that director Bar Luhurmann was responsible from the assinine "Romeo and Juliet" adaptation several years ago.But my fears were put to rest with this charming film. The true star is Catherine Martin's awe inspiring design work. No film has ever looked so visually beautiful.The performances,of course, are nothing to sneeze at...the fetching Nicole Kidman is sheer delight as Satine and posseses a singing voice that was quiete appealing.She turns in a sexy and stunning performance. Ewan McGregor is equally fine as the poet, Christian. Jim Broadbent steals every scene he is in as the Moulin Rouge's boisterous owner and M.C.,Harold Zidler.Broadbent is one of today's finest actor's and here he pulls out all the stops. I will say that I am not a fan of some of the music used in the film,(Roxanne,and Zidler's first song)however as reinterpreted by these fine actors, they are quite enjoyable. Luhrmann deserves applause for this fine achievement in cinema.</fullReview>

It pulls you in, it does not let you go and I loved every minute of it. The film's opening song(Nature Boy) becomes more and more haunting every time I hear it. We move through Turn of the century Paris, but this isn't the upper class were used to. No, we are seeing the other side, the "poor" side of Paris. However, it is so much more beautiful to see.It is impossible to pick a favorite scene. There are no stops, and you don't want it to stop. It is the musical I always dreamed of, the musical in your head where none, not-even-the slow ones are boring. It is all enthralling and you can't look away, it is too beautiful. El Tango Roxanne, I remember being blown away when I saw this number in the theater. It is breathtaking! THE ENTIRE FILM IS BREATHTAKING!!! WHAT AN ACHIEVEMENT! WHAT A RIDE! A MASTERPIECE! YES! YES! YES! BANG!(Fade to black, Cue music for Nature Boy)Moulin Rouge......................it is a film about...............love.</fullReview>

But, after many viewings, both in the theater and on DVD, I think that any real lover of film will readily admit that this is one of the best, if not the best film of 2001.

From it's first cinematic line the movie takes you thtough a fantastic journey of cabaret and nostalgia. It is sweet, queer, and funny. Kidman is full of wit and shine, and in all - it is the most glamorous film I've seen in quite a long time.

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Costumes and Sets but.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 4 out of 10. It would have been lower, but the fantastic colors costumes, sets and animation saved Moulin Rouge from being a total loss. The leads were definitely eye candy, but I didn't find them appealing beyond that. The "modern" music tended to be jarring and killed the mood the dialog built up. I thought the parts between the musical numbers tended to interrupt the flow, too.On the DVD, I the writers and other crew were more interesting to me than most of the main characters.I'd only recommend this movie if either like "vanity" movies (there was a lot of specialized lighting for the actors faces) or if you love excellent period costumes and set designs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much a Titanic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film, and I rush to comment on it here. Well, I just come up with an idea: this is a new Titanic story. Why? See here: 1. Satine(Rose) and Christian(Jack) come from different societies. 2. Satine(Rose) meets Christian(Jack) 3. They fall in love. 4. But there is a third-party here intruding into this affair: the Duke(Carl) 5. They try to hide it, but it is discovered at last. 6. The Duke(Carl) forces Satine(Rose) to leave Christian(Jack). Zidler(Rose's mother) advises Satine(Rose) to obey. 7. Satine(Rose) unwillingly says something to Christian(Jack) to break his heart. 8. On the stage, Satine and Christian(Jack and Rose) finally find that they really love each other. 9. The Duke(Carl) goes mad: he first hires a man to kill Christian(Jack), and then he picks up the gun himself. Failed. 10. The Duke(Carl) surrenders and leaves. 11. Oops. Satine(this time, she is Jack) is dying, telling Christian(Rose): hey, you should go on(you will never let go. Promise me now, Rose...) 12. Satine(Jack) is dead.Don't you think the film is simply a modified version of Titanic?I can't say the film is very bad, but at least it is far from great. The opening kills me. It's too exaggerating and the music is terrible. The film-makers apparently did this deliberately but I don't think it's good at all.The middle part is better: when Satine and Christian fall in love, and then part again. However, this doesn't continue. The ending is bad. When the door on the stage is opened, the good part ends. In fact, the way the show continues is stupid. It's over-emotional and the gun thing is not interesting at all. That 'high-flyer' just comes as a shock and spoils the original good scene. And as I have said, the very last scenes are poor and I don't want to comment on them any further.The love story is quite cheesy. I don't mean that it's not impressive or heart-rending, but hey, can there be anything fresher? We go to movie to see something new but not some old plots already marked as antique in a museum! In a nutshell, Moulin Rouge is not a surprise in every sense.Average: B to B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What to say about this film? As a little background, I'm a regular guy who enjoys a good film whether it be the latest Schwarzeneggar or a sappy chic flick. I have been awaiting to see this movie since it was in theaters and was watching the DVD release date closely. I wasn't sure what to expect but knew that the film has been hyped as artsy and is critically acclaimed. The last 'artsy' film that I remember seeing is Magnolia and I hated that movie. I recognized that the acting was superb but I didn't connect with the story itself.So anyway, Moulin Rouge is captivating. The first 30 - 45 minutes of the film are visually and musically stunning. The visuals reminded me a bit of Willy Wonka and are rather "trippy". I've never seen a broadway musical, but might imagine that watching this film is akin to seeing a Broadway show on acid.See this movie. Though the story has been told many times in the past (and what story hasn't?), the acting is excellent and the visuals are a treat for the eyes. This film is art and it is good art! See this movie. If you don't like films that are a bit off the wall, you won't like it. If you do, you'll love it. I give it an A and put it on my list of DVD's to own. Nicole Kidman is truly a beauty and Tom Cruise needs his head examined to have left such a woman!As a side note, if you haven't invested in a DVD player with a dolby digital receiver and speakers, you are missing out. Especially with a film like Moulin Rouge!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge could have been best movie musical since the heydays of MGM, with it's unparralled sets, incredible theatrical style lighting, and last but not least it's massive musical and dance numbers, but sadly it falls short because all these things come crashing down as it becomes a parody of itself over and over throughout the film.Including contemporary music, costuming and locations, yet reatining the classic story and dialog realy worked for Baz Luhrmann in his version of "Romeo + Juliet". These things drove the story and made it more accessible to a younger audience.Moulin Rouge! didn't need this, the story stood on it's own and didn't need gimics to draw audiences in. The ridiculous overuse of contemporary music turned what could be a classic into Vaudville. Once it's clever, twice it's tollerable, but relying on this "joke" throughout the entire movie ruins it's entertainment value. One minute it's story and character development is drawing you in, the next minute a kareoke version of "Roxanne" is being belted out.</fullReview>

After seeing Moulin Rouge, it remains at one.Moulin Rouge starts off with a painful amount of close-ups of Jim Broadbent's amazingly ugly face and some equally amazing special effects. The extraordinary settings of Moulin Rouge is enough of a reason to give it a watch, but the bland and clichéd story is what ultimately made me dislike it.I dare someone to just try and count the amount of editing cuts in this movie. That would probably be a greater feat than the writing of the script was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the "Moulin Rouge!" trailer, I became sceptic with the film. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman teased the audience, two brilliant actors in a musical could be interesting. But when I knew the person behind all the production was Baz Luhrmann ("Romeo+Juliet"), I thought it would be a strange, surrealistic film, like his other movies.I became more interested with the film when I heard that the music in "Moulin Rouge!" was including many greatest modern hits from U2, Nirvana, Elton John... That really surprised me, never expecting this twist in the film: "Smell Like Teen Spirits" or "All You Need Is Love" in the beginnings of the 20th century? It was sure a worth look.Finally, I saw the movie. And I must admit that "Moulin Rouge!" has reached deep inside on me. It has captivated the audience with its strength, its colourful shots, its "fairy tale" atmosphere, returning to the classical musical films, but with a cool modern look.Some people would say "Moulin Rouge!" lacks in plot. Just think for a moment: since when do musical movies emphasize in the story? Like "West Side Story" or "The Wizard of Oz", the most important thing is the music! Ewan McGregor plays the role of Christian, who falls in love with Satine (Nicole Kidman), the most beautiful girl on the Moulin Rouge, in Paris. It will start a relationship full of obstacles, which will end tragically...I think that the important points of the film are the rythm of the movie and the music. From the end until the beginning you won't be able to get out of the film. It will absorb you until the end. And in order to catch all the details, you should buy or rent it when it hits the stores, because in the cinema you will be overwhelmed by its greatness.One thing that really reached me is the beautiful message that delivers the film to the watcher: "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return". That's what all the people should keep in mind.Anyway, "Moulin Rouge!" is really a worth look. Charming, outstanding, fascinating and brilliant. What can I say more? The soundtrack is great and the DVD too! Really really a worth look! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching Moulin Rouge and I could kick myself for missing it while it was in the theaters! I don't think a film has ever touched me so deeply on so many emotions. It is a feast for the eyes. The plot, while familiar, is at once hilarious and terribly sad. The players are wonderful. Certainly, this film is a masterpiece and deserves the Oscar for Best Picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicole and Ewan shine in Baz's magnificent realisation of a wildly decadent past Paris!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann's magnificent film stands as his best work to date. Utilising the very best in digital wizzardry his team has produced a most stunningly fantastical visual treat that has to be seen on the big screen to be fully appreciated; for there is so much detail in this film it is sadly diminished when viewed on even a large t.v screen. That being said it was with great pleasure the film was reviewed again in the DVD format; with a lump in my throat I again heard Nic and Ewan sing that wonderful Elephant Love Medley in DTS, experienced the raw emotion of El Tango de Roxanne and felt as if I was at the Moulin Rouge during the Can-Can sequence.The production design, sound, musical scoring, costumes all outstanding and hopefully recognised by many industry nominations. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor head an extremely talented cast that give their all for Baz. This is the most entertaining film I have ever seen and cannot recommend it too highly to anyone looking for a stunning visual and aural feast. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"My gift is my song..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched the DVD of Moulin Rouge, for the second time after seeing it months ago in the theater, and absolutely fell in love with it. It's a visually complicated film that definitely takes more than one viewing to completely process, but that's the joy of it - each viewing brings more and more movie joy. The extra commentaries, dance sequences, interviews with the choreographer and behind the scenes footage definitely help in understanding and enjoying this wonderful, colorful and just plain fun movie.I've never thought Nicole Kidman was anything special, but she is surprisingly AMAZING in this film. Although the rest of the cast sparkles, Kidman immediately stands out as the true star of this film. She sings and dances as if she's been doing musicals her whole life, and brings life, charm and wit to a character that could easily become boring and cliched. She plays Satine, a courtesan in 19th century Paris whose one rule is to never fall in love. Enter Ewan McGregor, who plays a bohemian writer, and all the rules are broken.This storyline has been done a thousand times (everywhere from Pretty Woman to Dangerous Liaisons), but add Kidman's sparkling performance, McGregor's earnesty, and the brilliant medley of pop songs that fuel the film, and you have a hit.Although many reviewers have called the film's use of pre-existing pop songs unoriginal, I think the music is one of its strongest points... what's the point of watching a musical if you can't sing along to it, anyway? Besides, watch any Rodgers and Hammerstein era musical, and you wonder, "why are they all of a sudden singing?" In Moulin Rouge, the characters use existing lyrics and musical notes to convey in song feelings and stories that words alone just could not describe.My only grievance is that due to the MTV/ADD addled style of editing, many of the brilliant dance sequences are hard to get a grasp of, and the camera often bounces to something else when all you want to see is the sprawling choreography. However, thats what DVD's that include video footage of the dance rehearsals are for, after all...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was Tom Cruise thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the way Nicole Kidman looks in this film I can't understand why he (Tom) would leave her. Anyway, Moulin Rouge has been one of the most entertaining films since Bazmark released R + J in 1996. Baz has way of movie making and story telling that makes movies look like pop-up books. (3 Dimensional and Hands on) One of the first pictures I saw of the film was Nicole on the swing in the nice dark lingerie outfit with her beautiful red hair glistening in the cool black lights of the production. As soon as I saw it was a Baz film, I knew I had to see it. I didn't like the story too much, but the way it was told made it all the more better. I liked the chemistry between Ewan and Nicole. They made me believe they were in love; and the concept of the hooker wanting to be committed proved that people are still born to love one person. The song/dance sequences at the Club were very alive and the choreography looked like hours had been put into it. The movie itself is a mix between R + J and Strictly Ballroom. Both of which were Baz movies and excellent ones at that. I disliked that there is always a villain wanting to rule everything and everybody. I would have much preferred the lack of funding was the only problem and that the hero had to save the club with his new musical and he wins the girl at the same time. The performances by the actors were astounding. As far as I can see Hollywood doesn't credit John L. as they should. His performance in R + J alone should have warranted a nomination. However, when you add his performance in Spawn and Moulin Rouge to his list you have to ask yourself: What does Hollywood consider as talent? Fortunately, Moulin Rouge may win a few awards before it is filed under the Cult Classic, Underrated by the "Big Boys" category, which so many great movies have before it. One day, when talent, not ratings, run Hollywood more "fun" movies like Moulin Rouge will be produced and recognized as they should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wow (but one complaint)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i am surprised.the metaphorical play and the romance in the backdrop are woven beautifully, cleverly, and impressively to lead up to an incredible rendezvous at the end! the passion is mind-bending and explosively colorful, all done stylistically right. surprisingly, not pretentious in the slightest! this musical, as opposed to other musicals with less orthodox themes (most notably hedwig) is tailored for a rather normal audience, and i assume this is why it seems so unpretentious, as it is not fueled by an intense ego trip straining itself horribly to feed starved outside filmgoers. this is incredibly passionate yet in an elite/aloof/savvy sort of way. this moulin rouge adventure seems to be culled from an extravagantly brilliant mind with no whim to self-indulgences, which would make me feel bad for even picking faults. a cheerful fairy tale that wants the viewer to know that it is just looking for fun with no fuss, no muss. visually, everything seems perfect. everything is so appropriate and tasteful. i was delighted by the t-rex cover, but i felt that this movie was wasted by using such humdrum love songs. but obviously by these rave reviews one can only gather that the visuals &amp; plot in this MUSICAL must be stunning to be passed off as incredible when the music is rather lifeless. nicole kidman dances atrociously, but it does not even matter! ewan is great! see it.</fullReview>

As a musical, this movie plays like a live action bugs bunny cartoon complete with outrageous comedy bits and dazzling visuals. If you liked O Brother!, you will most likely enjoy Moulin Rouge. Don't go in expecting Evita. Expect lots of fast camerawork, incredible sets, great special effects, and a contemporary songlist and you'll be set to take in this wild adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprising eye-candy and music experience...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very resistant to seeing this film... after seeing "Sound of Music" 12 times as a child, I couldn't stomach another musical to save my life.Nevertheless, I broke down and rented "Moulin Rouge" at the recommendation of my friends, and I am very glad I listened to them. Moulin Rouge is not only a surprisingly-well-made film experience, it is an absolute treat for the eyes and ears!Let me start by declassifying this from the 'musical movie' genre... unlike 'Grease', I would better describe Moulin Rouge as its own hybrid genre of 'eclectic music video'. There are big dance numbers added to please dance fans, and there is a Les-Miserables-Romeo-Juliet storyline woven into the music to keep the romantics happy. In the end, though, this movie is about powerful and emotive music.The most compelling part Moulin Rouge has got to be the clever remaking and rearranging of dozens of classic pop songs, and then using these remakes as part of the dialogue narrative. Baz Luhrmann's bold directing style really shows during these dance/vocal scenes, and Craig Armstrong's brilliant music score will keep your foot tapping to familiar songs from the 70s and 80s. Generation X viewers will chuckle at the U2, Madonna, Queen, Elton John, Nirvana, David Bowie, Fatboy Slim, T Rex, and Kylie Minogue sound bites.(fyi: Kylie Minogue plays a 20 second part as a green fairy, and Ozzy provides her background vocals).I personally didn't care for the star-crossed lovers storyline part... that doesn't appeal to my tastes... but the big-band music and dance choreography was thoroughly enjoyable, and far outweighed any sappiness.HIGH POINTS OF THIS FILM:-The Diamond Dogs scene (complete with acid-tripping CanCan dance and Nirvana-meets-Fred-Astaire choreography)-The "Your Song" scene (where McGregor and Kidman serenade each other like Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta, except they quote Kiss, the Beatles, Sweet, Joe Cocker, and Captain and Tennille while they sing.)-The "Like a Virgin" scene (where Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh take Madonna into interpretive jazz territory)-The "Roxanne" scene (where Jacek Koman turns the Police into a heavy-metal latin number)-Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman actually do all their own singing throughout the film.LOW POINTS OF THE FILM:-The ending will not make romantic viewers very happy.-They didn't manage to work any Led Zeppelin or Van Halen. (now *that* would have really impressed me!)A thoroughly fun rental, especially for Generation X music fans. I not only give this film Two Enthusiastic Thumbs Up, but I would also recommend it as a DVD purchase just to see the extra music and dance footage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure everyone else loved this movie...But I didn't.It certainly isn't as bad as some things I've seen, but after hearing such high praise for this film I was expecting MUCH, MUCH MORE.I knew the film was a musical, however I didn't know that all the music was lifted from other musicals/musicians and then sung karaoke style. I was not impressed and couldn't help but groan when they began to sing Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' as a dance number. It's like taking the lyrics of 'Rage Against the Machine' and putting them in a Hansen video... the two just don't fit together, and taking the music out of it's context like that completely negates what the original artist intended. (a la Disney's sanitizing of Victor Hugo's political satire 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame.')Aside from the music, my only other complaint was the BLAH message the film repeated OVER and OVER and OVER again by Ewan McGregor. Love is good, Love is Great, Life is Love, We all need Love, Life is meaningless without Love.... etc. etc. etc...I kept expecting the film to get a little deeper, or at least try to explain why love is good... but it didn't. If you want a great love story, there are a whole bunch out there that are much better than this film.That said, the supporting cast were entertaining... and the overall look of the film is definitely impressive if not surreal.Overall, costumes, choreography and art direction are to be commended, writing and direction are not.

		<shortDescription>Turkey for Christmas?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever happened to all the charm from the musicals of the 50'es and 60'es? I don't know, but at least you shouldn't expect to find any of it in this overblown turkey. I can tell you that. The general enthusiasm among commentators about this film I will never understand. Were they all stoned when they watched it?Baz Luhrman's latest work must be one of the worst films of 2001. An embarrassing mixture of musical and comedy, and yet almost devoid of continuous singing or dancing performances. Besides it is surprisingly witless (read: unfunny), too. Don't let the title mislead you to hope for plenty of Toulouse-Lautrec or can-can dancing because both are bitterly rationed here. Much of the songs and the dialogue consists of small bits of pop or rock songs stolen from Elton John, The Beatles, T. Rex, Queen, Madonna and others, so there are no `Edelweiss' or `Chim-Chim-Cheree' to be found here. The acting is reduced to incessant posturing and grimacing by everybody involved including a marzipan-skinned Nicole Kidman who here looks paler than a George Romero zombie. One of those movies where you root for the hero and heroine to die long before 90 minutes have elapsed. Actually 127 minutes were sufficient indeed, and I would like to thank Mr. Luhrman for not stretching it further.If you haven't already, you should watch the infamous `Lady Marmalade' music clip with poodle-haired Christina Aguilera and the other girlies instead. It will give you a good impression of the style and content of the present film, and in case you dislike it, it will be over in 5 minutes. If you choose to watch `Moulin Rouge!', don't forget your seasick pills. The dizzying camerawork and flashy editing will make you need them very soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well what can i say! I love Moulin Rouge and everything about it! The storyline, dialogue, acting, special effects and the killer soundtrack!I must admit that the first time i say this at the movies i was somewhat overwhelmed by it all. i came out feeling partly stunned by the sheer brilliance. Then recently, i rented it on video and just, i don't know, it suddenly hit me, and i totally fell in love with everything about it.Moreover, this movie introduced me to Ewan Mcgregor. Since then, i have become his biggest fan. His charasmitic ability to draw people into whatever he is playing and totally embody his role, it just totally almost zones out everything else bad about the movie. Not that this was necessary in Moulin Rouge. Everything was great about the movie, the musical aspect of it, the humour and heartbreak. Nicole Kidman was great as well as well as all the supporting cast. Anyone thinking about seeing, i recommend it 100%.Moulin ROuge all the way!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is this movie in the top 250?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had very low expectations on this movie, and I was still largely disappointment. That, folks, is not good. Neither is this movie.I'll start with the good stuff. There are actually some nice moments in the beginning of the film. Of course one of the worst things is in the beginning too, but I'm getting to that. Some of the scenes, like when Christian first meets the "Spectacular, spectacular"-gang is rather fun. The scene where they explain the play to the duke is nice too. But that's about it.Can someone explain to me, what it is causing the editor to not being able to show more than 1/100th of a second at a time of footage in most of the movie. WHY does he necessarily have to switch through all the characters all the time? Let me watch one character speak, and then the other, THANK YOU! A lot of cuts works in action sequences in action movies. It helps the action there. In perfectly ORDINARY talk scenes, they have to have cut to different directions ALL THE TIME. What is it supposed to create? Is it supposed to be "cool"? Personally, it just gives me headache and takes away my concentration on the plot.When you write a script to a movie, there are things you leave out for the audience so there will be a reason to watch to the end of the film. This, movie, I must remind myself that that's what it is, reveals the ending right in the beginning! I suppose you could consider this a spoiler, but since it so clearly pointed out even before the real narrative starts, I can't see why I shouldn't tell it. In comparison, consider how good The Usual Suspects or Citizen Kane would be if one found out how it was going to end in the beginning.From the point where Zidler or whatever his name is, signs the contract, you know exactly how the movie is going to proceed. This is somewhere in the middle. It drags on, scene after scene. I sat there in the end, wishing it would end in a somewhat original or at least surprising way. But no, I get nothing. Except fear.Fear that it is movies like this which people are going to promote and see in the future. Movies with no plot, horrible script, very weird selection which characters to develop, appalling editing and these anachronistic songs all the time. Ok, so they're clearly modern songs, but people singing about smog around the shift of the century? No thanks.Granted a big part of the musical is the music, they still need a story to capture one's interest. You can't make a movie with special effects, we all know this, but likewise you can't make a good musical without a somewhat intriguing plot. The Nightmare Before Christmas, Sound of Music, even South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut are fine examples of great musicals with good stories.I give this movie a 4/10 just because there were some good parts (albeit very few), Nicole Kidman is good looking and Ewan McGregor was in it. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go think about the hours of my life which I have lost forever. Which I could have spent on more important things like poking out that stuff which collects in your belly button. If you haven't seen this movie, but plan to, I advice you to turn on MTV for two hours. It will have basically the same effect, except most of the time you will see commercials which may be at least remotely original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Baz Luhrman's grand musical extravaganza arrived on a wave of make or break expectations following rumours of budget overspends,last minute panic at the editing stage and a much prolonged shooting schedule ( partly the result of Nicole Kidman's injured ankle). The initial interviews were very mixed, both in Australia and overseas . Public reaction was very positive in Australia and Europe. The U.S. market was more measured in its response ( though it is apparently performing much better in a current pre-Oscar nomination re release(bolstered now by Kidman's great U.S. success in "The Others") Now that the dust has settled on the initial reactions to the movie, it is possible to take a more balanced response. Firstly, let me say that I find Moulin Rouge to be one of the most purely entertaining of the last year. The fabulous costumes and set design alone indicate much more expense than the comparatively modest budget would suggest possible.The mood of high exaggeration,frenetic pacing, camerawork and editing combined with near hysterical performances threaten to overwhelm the movie initially. However, Luhrman's plan to contrast his central love story against this background of high energy and wild exaggeration ultimately works splendidly in a new and hitherto untried way in movie musicals. The use of modern popular songs again works amazingly well and produces both moving and sometimes hilarious results. For all his directing brilliance, this daring mix of diverse elements would probably not have worked at all without the strength of the two central performances. Both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are superb and touching and hold the movie together. The other characters revolve around them as necessarily two dimensional constructs, funny,nasty or grotesque.</fullReview>

Jim Broadbent, a supporting actor also deserves credit for his great acting time in this movie.Ewan McGregor writes a script and wants to turn it into a play at the nearby Moulin Rouge. The people who live in the apartment upstairs from him call him and help get to talk to Harold (Jim Broadbent) to turn this script into a play. The story takes longer than that so Ewan finds Satine and falls in love with her. Then then films gets even more interesting. With singing performances and acting up to great standards you may not notice the great sets provided for the film's setting. They are fabulous and everything runs smoothly to provide a great movie.*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is one of the most daring film experiences of recent times. It is completely different to anything released this year- I mean, its an Australian musical set in a 19th century brothel in Paris. This could be the reason it has been slammed by American critics; anything that doesn't resemble the formulaically produced American crap seems to be ignored or unfairly judged. This movie is involving from the moment the red curtains are opened. There is a level of audience participation with this movie that keeps you awake and interested in the experience. Its certainly not the type of movie that your gonna find your thoughts wandering off in. Just because it doesn't involve a thousand explosions or Julia Roberts, its still worth a look. Anyone with an open mind, looking for an interesting, unique and ENTERTAINING film will love Moulin Rouge!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McGregor's Best; Kidman's Breakthrough; together FANTASTIC!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the first time in Calendar Year 2001, I walked out of a film and thought that maybe, just maybe, I had just seen 'Best Picture'...!With an opener like that where do I begin? As noted with "A Knight's Tale", we have a revisionist approach to a musical in order to animate an audience where period music would not, and yet this in and of itself, while an ingenious idea, cannot guarantee success. Except that in both the mentioned films, it worked... and fabulously so!Nicole Kidman went ignored after a hugely successful performance in "Eyes Wide Shut" a film that would prove quasi-prophetic in at least one sense although few would know at the time. It seemed in fact that neither performance with husband Tom Cruise (Far and Away, 1992) would earn either member of the now severing couple the praise they deserved. Kidman of course came out the bigger loser, having starred in the interim opposite many a big name and with very little notice. This has now changed! Ewan McGregor, on the other hand, far newer but improving rapidly, just slides right into this role as if he were born for it. They both do, and it may be the springboard both needed: story, art direction, music, sets, costumes, make-up, direction, and yes acting, not to mention the singing (!!!) will have this film well up on the awards platter at serving time. In addition to our two leads, outstanding supporting performances from John Leguizamo and Richard Roxburgh are thrilling, and this is one film where the entire cast could garner the Screen Actor's Guild award for Cast &amp; Company as everyone involved in the unfolding of the story played a critical role, no matter how great or small. Add Best Soundtrack and possibly Best Song to the honours list and then you have it. A true masterpiece! To director Baz Luhrmann and fellow script co-writer Craig Pearce, "Chapeau"!A five star film not to be missed and an early favourite for Best Picture, buy your tickets and see it now! Rating 5 stars (of five), simply flawless...!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great visual achievement, missing a truly moving tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS***Having just seen 'MOULIN ROUGE' for the fifth time, I am ready to deliver my verdict on this visually challenging, but somewhat emotionally distant film. It's chief asset, and it is a wonderful asset, is director Baz Luhrmann's original and imaginative view of Paris, circa 1900. The film is a how-to exercise in making big, grand entertainment and making it entertaining rather than resulting in an exercise of self-congratulation. I enjoyed the way that, visually, everything was brazenly overdone, down to the decision to film all scenes, particularly the dance scenes, in gaudy reds and yellows.Performances, save one, were particularly well done in a film that must have been difficult to perform in. Nicole Kidman delivers another superb performance, proving that she is also a very adept singer. Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxbrugh are also very fine in roles which they seem to have been instructed to not hold back; I particularly enjoyed Roxbrugh's immensley entertaining villian, who reminded me of the man in the pantomimes in the black hat who grins wickedly at the audience, and Roxbrugh embodies this persona wonderfully. The one performance that just doesn't reach the same level of excellence of the rest of the cast is that of leading man Ewan McGregor. His singing voice, particularly in the scenes where he must hit, or struggle to hit, the high notes of 'THE SOUND OF MUSIC,' grew increasingly tiresome and irritating for me, (I have spoken to other people who have said that McGregor's voice was acceptable, so it must be a matter of personal choice.) I also found his constant reliance on looks from his puppy-dog eyes to be somewhat nauseating.Luhrmann has said that, with his movie, he wanted to present a view of the Moulin Rouge that would be shocking/exciting to contemporary audiences. This results in the usage of music that is some seventy to eighty years out of its time. I don't know where Luhrmann found the inspiration to have Kidman sing 'DIAMONDS ARE A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND' as an opening cabaret number, or to stage Madonna's 'LIKE A VIRGIN' using Richard Roxbrugh and Jim Broadbent careening around on a bed on wheels, or to stage the Police hit 'ROXANNE' as a tango dance led by Jacek Koman, but these scenes create moments of true movie magic and stand out in my mind as some of the great moments in modern cinema.The one final fault with this film lays with its love story. The love story didn't work for me because it involved laying heavy human emotion on two characters who had insofar been established as caricatures. I think back to Luhrmann's own 'STRICTLY BALLROOM' (1993) which treated the love story between its two caricatures as secondary to visuals and therefore succeeded. I must confess to feeling very restless during the final curtain-call scene. I stared at the screen and wondered whether I was supposed to care about a character who wasn't even human. The tragedy would have worked far better for me had it been a more metaphoric one, to fit with the mood of the preceding two hours.It is still one of the greatest looking films I have ever seen and the music and set design are first-class, as you will see from my 'out of 10' rating. However it misses its potential to be a great film because of Luhrmann's inability to decide which way he wants it; all style or all substance or, (and this would have been the mark of a great film) a bit of both. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning! - This movie took me by surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so glad I was able to see this movie on the big-screen. I almost didn't because to be honest I thought the movie looked dumb when I first saw the trailer. It looked like a hokey MTV music video stretched into a 2 hour love story. Luckily, through word of mouth from friends who usually have reliable movie recommendations, I decided to give it a chance. It isn't just a movie, it's an adventure. A wild trippy ride that takes you where no movie has ever taken you. I should have been more prepared, knowing the un-orthodox style of the director, Baz Luhrmann. However, even his previous ground-breaking style movies such as Romeo + Juliet &amp; Strictly Ballroom gave no indication that a movie such as this was on the horizon. See it! Enjoy it! And like a fun ride at an amusement park, you will crave the experience over and over again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie of 2001 So Far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is not just a romantic musical, it is a theatrical experience of the heart, eyes, mind and soul. This film delivers a moving passionate love story amidst cutting edge electric direction and music deliveries that dazzle the senses.Set at the turn of the century in France's bohemian subculture, this film tells the tale of a man, Christian (Ewan McGregor) who goes there from England to write about the movement. Instead, by a strange twist of fate he is talked into writing for a play at the famed Moulin Rouge. He ends up becoming enchanted by Satine (Nicole Kidman), the main star of the Moulin Rouge who is also a courtesan. Christian falls uncontrollably in love with her.The movie is cute and charming, very, very romantic. For those who scoff at the high concepts of love, this is movie is definitely not for you. This film also contains singing and dancing in a theatrical manner. But the funny thing is the songs are not all Julie Andrews type songs, most of them are modern hits of the last decade or so, like Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" or Madonna's "Like A Virgin" (which gets a truly hillarious delivery). Notice how I didn't say it was a musical? To call this film a musical is like calling Mt. Everest a tall mountain. It underscores the greatness. All of the actors in this film do their own singing, even Nicole Kidman, and shock! She sounds good. Both Nicole and Ewan underwent weeks of singing lessons for this movie. Ewan has an incredible voice and is a powerful actor.The entire production, the costumes, the characters, the musical numbers, it is all very visually captivating. Baz Luhrman's (Romeo &amp; Juliet) production is cutting edge, bringing an animated feel to the movie, and adding much life to it. If you are open to new deliveries of old ideas, and enjoy romantic love stories set amidst pending doom, this will be a movie you should not miss. This film will not be for everyone, but for me it was a pleasant surprise. It will be a shock if it does not pick up an Oscar nod for music and costumes, if not a nomination for Best Film of the Year, which as December 6th, it is for me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suffice to say, if you are a fan of Baz Luhrmann (as I am) you will love this film. I don't think the anachronistic use of modern-day songs could have been more expertly woven into a story, to give it a depth and emotional credibility that just would not have been possible if it were being told "straight".This is not a history lesson, and there are no morals or hidden meanings. It is simply a fantasy that takes your eyes, ears, and emotions on a holiday that you wish you didn't have to come back from.An enormous amount of love, passion, and meticulous attention to detail went into the making of this film and every member of the cast and crew deserves a standing ovation for their efforts.An inspiring effort: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all the Hollywood monopolisation of recent times, this was a wonderfully fresh and daring buck of the trend. I am amazed that there are so many good reports on this site though as it is not the kind of film that I would recommend to anyone. But it seems that you are mostly in agreement with me that M.R. really is a masterpiece. The wonderfully camp performances of all involved, and the outrageous costumes and scenery were a real joy. One question though, watching the (perfect) performance of Nicole Kidman, how on earth must they have felt doing this. Like right fools probably, and more than a little worried about the final outcome. However, B.Th. managed to put together a beautiful feast for the senses, and made the unworkable work, and the unthinkable dazzle. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was my favourite movie of the year.At first, I didn't want to watch it because the trailers on tv make it look hoaky, but then my friends dragged me to see it cause they heard it was good.I couldn't imagine the movie would be that good!

The chemistry between him and Nicole was unbelievable.I can't wait to buy this on DVD now.Shame on the Moulin Rouge PR department for making hoaky trailers on tv (although the trailers for the movie in the theatres were well done, I can't say the same for ones shown on tv). Maybe this is the reason why it didn't do so well at the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A BRILLIANT MADNESS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is brilliant!It has a script with tons of cliches, an editing style that makes MTV jealous and - no - it's no film by Michael Bay.Instead we get one of the best musicals ever. Where other musicals have their 'own' songs, Moulin Rouge! uses pop-songs from the 1970's, 1980's and 1990's to carry the whole film and it works great, even if the film plays in 1899 and 1900.McGregor and Kidman, the two leads playing Christian and Satine, are a perfect match and this combination will be placed in movie history along with other classic couples like Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca and Leigh and Gable in Gone With the Wind. Time has to tell if Moulin Rouge! will become a classic like these two, but it looks good for Moulin Rouge! It's my favorite film of the year (closely followed by A.I. and Fellowship of the Ring has yet to come!)Baz Luhrmann is absolutely brilliant, something we could've seen already in Romeo + Juliette. It seems he doesn't know what an anachronism is, but that's completely fine with me. In the hands of a lesser director this could've been a very bad film, but it all turned out perfect.My favorite part is where Christian and Satine are on the top of the Elephant and start singing several songs (or at least a few lines of them) in one brilliant scene.Is there anything wrong with this film? Perhaps the first half hour is sometimes too much, but it delivers great cinema. And, like said before, the script is a collection of cliches, but in this case it didn't bother me, because the film had tons and tons of other things to offer. These small minor points are nothing against the pro's the film has to offer. Just see it... no, EXPERIENCE it!I wonder why it did so poorly at the box-office? Are people not ready for it? Were it the poor reviews of critics who praised The Mummy Returns and Pearl Harbor (both: worthless, especially in comparison with Moulin Rouge!) and thought Moulin Rouge! was a mediocre film? I don't know. Maybe one day we'll know...To be short:This one will blast you out of your seat and has to be seen in the theater. It's a total cinematic explosion! A film to love and see over and over again!It's a true must-see and I rate it 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Musicals is one of my favorite film genres. Before Moulin Rouge, The Sound of Music is the only musical movie (in English) in my classic list.The development of love story in Moulin Rouge is not twisted, actually it is quite simple. But it does not mean it is boring. The above-all and heart-breaking love between Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor keeps captivating you completely from beginning to end. The excellent performance of leading actors bring us great enjoyment both visually and emotionally and bring the film an exceptional achievement.The songs are fantastic. When they are sung, it seems they are drifting from the remote heaven, or flowing out from deep heart, so beautiful. The dancing is also entertaining. The costume is visually rich and pleasant.I am glad I did not miss it in the theater. It is most enjoyed on a big screen, a lot of effect will be either substantially weaken or lost when watching it on video or DVD.I am wondering how long I have to wait for another Moulin Rouge or The Sound of Music to be filmed?</fullReview>

Early in the movie I was a bit bored by too much light and dancing and the rest of elements of a musical but, fortunately, things improved before long. It was the first time I really paid attention to a Nicole Kidman's performance (Yes, it's true), and the same can be said for Ewan MacGregor, who I hardly knew something about, aside from his appearance in Star Wars.Though I have liked Moulin Rouge, my opinion on musicals hasn't changed.6/10.</fullReview>

The cinematography is breathtaking and deconstructionist. Baz Luhrman has achieved something remarkable with the heady cocktail of pace, lights, colour alongside a deeply subversive critique of Hollywood movie making. So ... you can watch this film as a modern musical, and if you like musicals you'll like it, if you don't you won't. But, watch it on a deeper level and watch Luhrman's wonderful deconstruction at work. Outstanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard of Moulin Rouge, I thought it was going to be a mundain love story and had no real desire to see it apart than to see what the hype was about. Then i found out it was a musical and i was put off even more. I was not fond of musicals made into movies. Who wants to see Les Miserables on TV after seeing it on Broadway? When I actually got around to seeing it, I was completely blown away. The setting and scenery, enhanced by special effects, were beautiful. It was wonderfully gaudy and outlandish. This may seem like a drawback but it was so original and overwhelmingly beautiful so it was one of the best aspects of the movie. Moulin Rouge is a musical about a musical. This reflexivity serves to comment on the nature of the art form and the events in each parallel each other. Another moving part of the movie was the use of modern music. The audience can identify more with the movie by using songs such as "like a virgin." All in all it was an amazing movie, brilliantly made and geniously created.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Marvel of sights and sounds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** This film, set in 1899 is really one of the most original films for years, that has big names and big bucks in it. I must say I was really astonished in how Baz Luhrmann was able to merge the feeling of a 1899 nightclub with modern 20th century music. I mean there were so many modern love songs mingled into the story and singing, I sometimes wondered if the writers had come up with anything of their own. But disregarding the fact that they were all existing songs I have to admire the way they were integrated into this film. That was really a job well done. First of all (for most of them and the ones I recognized) they were rearranged and then the parts were sung by actors and/or some singers. Then there was the enormous variety of genre's the songs were from, without even disturbing one another. I mean there was grunge, soul, pop and rock, with songs like (QUEEN - The Show Must go On; THE POLICE - Roxanne; THE BEATLES - All you need is Love; MADONNA - Material Girl and Like A Virgin; WHITNEY HOUSTON - I'll Always Love You; NIRVANA - Smells Like Teen Spirit; KISS - I Was Made For Loving You; DAVID BOWIE - Heroes and PATTI LA BELLE - Lady Marmalade). I only list the songs I recognized (and remembered) and their original artists as far as I can remember them, because I do not know who sang them in the film. The mingling of these various popular and famous songs of different genre's into a film about a brothel in the late 20th century is an accomplishment of itself.As in regards to the story, I feel there is nothing much to say, first of all it is a film about love. And one with a tragic ending (no spoilers here, because Ewan McGregor will reveal this himself within the first 5 minutes of the film). For this it is comparable with the 3 greatest love stories ever told in history (GONE WITH THE WIND, TITANIC and DRACULA). It just has everything to become an instant classic. It is set (as the other three films) in a time where there is no (or not much) electricity and that gives it something of 'the good old days' feeling with a bit of a more romantic feeling, for that was the time when men were still gentlemen and romanticism had it's peak.As far as the film goes there are three things that stand out. First of all the direction of Baz Luhrmann, who (again) after Romeo and Juliet succeeded in giving a story set in the past something of a modern look. His vision and direction of this story is really great and combines to make this the sights and sounds spectacle it eventually came to be (Oscar nominee for directing I guess, but no award).Then there are the decorations and the costumes, which are really great and visually so demanding that you become lost in them and are thereby dragged into this romantic, humorous and tragic musical of epic proportions (An Oscar for costumes and a nomination for Art Direction / Set decoration)Well, as should be done in a film, I saved the highlight for last. The best thing about this film is.....Nicole Kidman. No offense to the other actors who all did a good job, but she really outshone everyone of them, she was superb, magnificent, extraordinary simply put she was just GREAT. She was very, very convincing as the courtesan that wished to be more, that wished to fly away but.well I'm not revealing more than the first five minutes of film do.dies in the end. With that in mind one might predict the ending (as I somehow did) and not like this film, due to predictability. I mean I am not saying that this film should get an award (or even a nomination) for best story or screenplay. No, what I am saying is that this film is so visually exciting and gripping that it overcomes predictability and surges to a highpoint, only to be picked up by Nicole Kidman who takes this film even higher to the top of the mountain, to greatness. Despite that I'm not saying that this film landed on the highest mountain ever, but it sure is in the area nearest to the moon and stars. Leaving behind any movie I've seen this year. Therefore it is in my opinion unavoidable that this film will get the Oscar for best movie (I know it somehow will). For it is by far the best movie of the year 2001.And the Oscar for best actress goes to (well it will anyway): NICOLE KIDMAN (standing ovations please!!!)8,5 out of 10</fullReview>

Oh, I can bet that I will see it again. But take a girl's advice and DON'T GO ALONE to see this movie. Take a friend or your lover...and see how he or she reacts. The feelings will be twice stronger.

		<fullReview>Hi Moulin Rouge lovers!! This movie is the most tragic love story I have ever seen. In close second Romeo &amp; Juliet. Moulin Rouge was a sad but quite funny movie with great acting bt THE HOTTEST GUY EVER Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. A movie has never made me feel like that did and I cannot wait until it is released to own. Unfortunately I have only seen it twice do to the lack of major movie theaters lack of playing it. The critics hacked this great love musical and they don't understand the hard work and awesome songs that went into it. Luckily I was able to get the Moulin Rouge soundtrack and never get tired of it. This movie gets 2 thumbs up, 10 stars, and my ultimate seal of approval. My advice watch it as many times as you can as often as you can!!"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love and be loved in return."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhat very clever (!!!) and very well balanced movie. It has EVERYTHING what cinema suppose to bring to us. It has comedy elements, jokes, good music for almost everyone's taste, great drama and ... Something it's impossible to describe. That feeling. When you fall in love with this movie. You don't know why is so special to you. But it is.Details? Music is so blurred together with story, it's looks like you watching one big video clip all the time. Performance of everyone - McGregore, Kidman, all other actors - are simply amazing. Singing....It made me a little jealous to McGregore which actually shows how to sing. He sings from heart. I sing with him usually when I listen soundtrack.I won't tell you anything, because again this is the movie which you must see and gain your, very personal opinion.And in shorts words - centuries come and go, love stays. All you need is love. total 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't like musicals. I've never liked the fact that people start to sing when I least expect it (and least want them to). I guess I like Moulin Rouge since it's so crazy that the singing doesn't seem as unnatural as in other films.Moulin Rouge is first and foremost a feast for the eyes. The production design is spectacular as is the costume design. The visual effects are brilliant. It's colourful and dazzling. It feels original. The premise of the movie is not original at all, a classic story of doomed love. For once, though, I didn't think about the fact that the premise is so archetypical, I was too busy watching the screen.Both Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, as well as most of the supporting players, are brilliant. Moulin Rouge is a crazy and beautiful film. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, what a Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is by far one of the best movies of the early 21st century. It should set standards for movies and musicals to come. The imagery, graphics, costumes and emotions were all real and quite amazing. The costumes were certainly on the money for the times of the day. The acting by Nicole and Ewan and cast were wonderful and very believable. The sets and style in which this movie was filmed was so original and unique. There is simply no way to describe it really. One must see it! Only a few things bothered me, and they were minor compared to acting and special effects which made up for it. Warning this may be a spoiler to some but I will keep it as generic as possible.!For the most part the music was great and quite funny at times. However, I was expecting more original tunes, like ALL of most musicals have. Tunes from the 1980's really doesn't fit in the 1900's style of music for that day. I was a little disappointed in the tune by Madonna and Sting re-arranged as it were. Maybe it's an honor to use another star's tunes, but I it's hard to beat the original. But in reality, the arrangements of their tunes were so funny, which made it easy to look over and try to focus on the very upbeat and gripping love story taking place. Trust me, there is no room for boredom in this flick. The special effects were truly amazing and realistic.!!I do love musicals and this one is truly one to start a genre or revival of musicals for the 21st century, hopefully. One other thing, Toulousse Lautrec was played well by Leguizamo, but I was looking forward to seeing some of his art portrayed in the movie as well as the story line be more based on his character. Being an art lover also, one can imagine my disappointment when no beautiful impressionistic art was to be seen throughout the movie. However, the costumes were so up to date for the early 1900s that this helped me imagine the artwork Lautrec was painting, and what inspired him during those tumultuous times in Paris during his day.Anyway this one is definitely 8 out of 10 stars. It would be a ten if not for the pop music and more story on Lautrec! Great movie, definitely in top 5 of 2001!Go see it to believe it and just sit back and try to absorb everything that is being thrown at you at you once. What a RIDE! Go Nicole and Ewan, you guys rule!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully stirring, funny, emotive and original film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I went to the cinema to see "Moulin Rouge". I should have known that the superlative Baz Luhrmann would not disappoint his fans(I speak as an English teacher who has seen even the most resistant pupils warm to "Romeo &amp; Juliet" through his film version.)The golden age of musicals would seem to be long gone(apart from many wonderful Disney animations). Well this statement I am pleased to say is no longer true!What an absolutely wonderful cinematic experience this film was. I viewed this film with my Mum (67 years old) and my ten year old son who's an ADHD sufferer and he could not take his eyes off the screen! Three different generations were thrilled by the songs, the colour and the fine acting of both the leading and supporting actors. There is a clear chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor and you always sympathise with their characters and the trials and tribulations that they face in the story. Their wonderful singing voices and clever choice of songs (Elton John's "Your Song" takes on a whole new life)only add to the illusion that they are a couple deeply and genuinely in love. The course of true love never did run smooth and you can almost imagine the Duke twirling his moustache like the stereotypical baddie. However, this film never turns into parody.There are many witty and humorous sections(watch out for Ewan and Nicole's first encounter where Ewan only wants to read poetry to the gorgeous Satine)and both stars display comic timing very different from many of the cinematic roles they are most famous for.Ewan is an absolute babe and Nicole stunning in a variety of outfits which show off her endless legs (I am sooo jealous!!! Tom Cruise YOU MUST BE MAD!)This film would stand with such fine classic musicals as "The King and I" and "South Pacific" and the addition of many contemporary songs pleased both an eighties chick and a current chart fan. The twists and turns of the plot and the visual feast for the viewer meant that this film was never predictable and with a story line (that could easily have turned into schmaltz) to tug at even the hardest heart, this is a must see for everyone.An absolute triumph!! Forget the usual boring, predictable films turned out by Hollywood and go and see something which will restore your faith in the power and magic of cinema at its best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, this movie has a trivial plot and no realism but that's not the point because it is a SHOW. It is not even about a show, it IS one.The beginning already shows this - the canvas becomes a curtain, with a conductor in front - you're not watching a stroy about the Moulin Rouge, you're sitting in the Moulin Rouge.The movie is not even trying to move you to the fin the siecle, to the early 1900's, to show you an historic show. NO, it's a show of TODAY, with TODAY's songs (songs of the 60's to 90's which did not exist in 1900 when the movie "takes place").So stop thinking. Just relax, and enjoy this extraordinary audiovisual experience. This is one of the movies that trade in realism for being an artwork, and that I like very much. The flying views of the city reminded me of "The Crow" and other comic strip movies, like "Batman" and "Dick Tracy". I love this kind of somewhat strange athomsphere.And I loved hearing well known songs in surprising arrangements, like "Roxanne", "The Show Must Go On", even "I Was Made For Loving You" sung by this elf, Nicole Kidman, instead of these "horror-masked" bad boys of KISS.I totally fell in love with this unique artwork, and gave it a 9/10. The missing 10th is due to I think it could have been done better, if you got the best singers/actors of the world which Kidman and McGregor are not. But without doubt they did a good job and I was surprised how well "Obi-wan Kenobi" can sing. And I pity Tom Cruise for losing this breathtaking wonderful woman, Nicole Kidman.A must see for everyone who loves musicals, romance and bizarre, fast-paced pictures. One of the best movies in 2001.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Of The Year?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It started and I was surprised, it was nothing like I was expecting. Ewan McGregor? Singing? This can't be right..Still, it appeared to be happening, whether my eyes believed it or not. Once you get used to the fact that it is set in the Moulin Rouge in 1899/1900 but they still appear to be singing Elton John and Police numbers, you can begin to enjoy the film itself. Don't let this fact put you off, the songs that have been chosen (and there are many) have been done with consummate care and attention and all work excellently well in a setting you would not expect them too. 'Like A Virgin' being quite marvelous in particular. McGregor plays an Englishman arriving in Paris in the Summer of 1899, to live life hedonistically with the Bohemians of the time. He writes a play to be performed at the Moulin Rouge by their resident cast, lead actress of which is Nicole Kidman, who actually glows in her role. She shows off her more than capable singing voice. Supported by an excellent all singing, all dancing cast of what appears to number hundreds. Some wonderful camera shots, a dramatic score that tingles on the back of your neck in parts and casting that would appear to be close to perfection, this is clearly (and by some margin) the best of the bunch thus far. Glorious, decadent, witty, fascinating and tragic. Absolutely delightful.</fullReview>

Every aspect of the film fits together, there is no moment that makes you think 'That doesn't fit' or 'I don't think he/she would react like that'. The fast moving, surrealistic approach was superb and Luhrmann got it spot on. The chemistry between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman was brilliant. They were so convincingly in love. The entire cast was brilliant, particularly Jim Broadbent and John Lequizamo as Toulouse-Lautrec. And Kylie's cameo as The Green Fairy was brilliant. I laughed hysterically, I cried my eyes out, I basically fell in love with all the characters. I would recommend this film to anyone who believes in freedom, beauty, truth and love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too clean, too pretty, too nice---This was an ugly, dirty era, and a bitter, nasty time in the era, but somehow, even as our central figures suffer disease, cough up blood, and generally display ill health we wind up with a painting of light that manages to ignore the bitter ugliness of the era.If it had been a bit dirtier, if we had seen that even the rich were forced to scratch their lice, if the ugly undertones of adult and child prostitution had been shown more clearly it would have been more understandable why they were willing go to such extremes to escape a hopeless life "at the fringe" of society.You cannot fault the actors; you can fault the writers and producers for not making sure the ugly was included-- and then contrasting the beautiful, although doomed, against it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb reappropriation of classical musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful reworking of the classical film musical of the 1940s and 50s (like "An American in Paris"), "updated" for younger generations. It blends a very sentimental, but touching story, familiar songs, and a 50s musical setting with a visual esthetic reminding that of video clips. The film is based essentially on the fact that the viewer already knows all the elements of it (we know from the first scene on how the story will end, the setting, characters, and occurring conflicts are familiar, as is the music). The film seems to aim to be the "non plus ultra" of film musical, it contains everything this genre - as well as other, related genres like video clips, revue movies, historic melodramas, and even animated Disney flicks (check out the green fairy scene or the singing moon!) - have to offer. It succeeds in this in an amazing way, due to the perfect screenplay, the good choice of music, the absolutely wonderful photography (has any actress ever seemed so beautiful on film as Nicole Kidman does here?!), and the stunning editing. A must-see, especially for those who are interested in film history and like to be overwhelmed by the visual richness of a movie.</fullReview>

But above all this is the film of Ewan Mcgregor, he is astonishing in his performance, he IS Christian. I only knew him from Emma (with Gwyneth Paltrow), as Frank Churchill with the awful wig , and also there he proves he is a good singer. But what he is showing us in Moulin Rouge is a total different Ewan,he certainly is one of the most versatile, talented young actors of the moment. I really do hope he will be able to enchant us again, maybe in the new Phantom of The Opera, he would be the ultimate Raoul !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's nothing wrong with the idea of the movie, not at all. What I miss is some actors that belongs in an "odd" movie like this. Nicole Kidman is a very good actriss but I just don't think it's the right movie for her. And something that really bothers me is that they've stolen 90% of the music. A musical without music s*x, that's just the way it is. So, some real music and other actors than this movie would have been very good. It's ok as it is but it's missing some important things. (Change Nicole for Björk and let her sing from the heart, then it's a full score movie ;) )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is what it sets out to be: a dazzling, colourful, exuberant celebration of bohemia and song. Normally, such glossy, seemingly shallow fare would best be avoided, but Moulin Rouge is an exception. And a damn good one at that.*small spoilers*Ewan McGregor is Christian, a romantic young poet with a knack for improvising song lyrics, a talent that brings him (via some drunken bohemians) to the Moulin Rouge - a nightclub for the rich and the beautiful, a whirlwind of sex and glamour. After a case of (that old screwball chestnut) mistaken identity, Christian ends up inadvertently falling for (and winning over) the queen bee of the Moulin Rouge - Nicole Kidman's courtesan Satine. Their romance is cemented in a visually stunning (and well sung) performance of Elton John's 'Your Song', but (as with all romances) their love is threatened, in this case by a whining rodent of a Duke (Richard Roxburgh). He wants Satine and seeing as Zidler (Jim Broadbent), the owner of the Moulin Rouge, needs the Duke's financing, he agrees to hand his star attraction over.The narrative is as dull and unoriginal as that. As far as the story is concerned, Moulin Rouge is poor. But this, surprisingly, doesn't seem to matter much. The story is secondary, a mere backdrop for Luhrmann to stage extraordinary musical numbers, and to display a range of emotions in the most glamorous and dazzling ways possible. If his attempts at doing so had fallen flat (none do), then this film would have been disastrous, like a 'Rocky Horror Picture Show' without the wryness and the controversy.Luhrmann delivered us an overly familiar story for a reason: this film is so packed with music, song, extravagant camera angles and sheer personality that an original story could have been overload. What Luhrmann has given us instead is a fantastic, original idea. The anachronistic use of familiar music is a pure success. The sentiments of each song represent what the Moulin Rouge was; a place of freedom, energy and lust (this is best shown in the introduction to the nightclub, when Luhrmann splices 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', 'Lady Marmalade' and 'Diamond Dogs' with a manic reworking of the Can Can).The film's unrelenting energy may overwhelm some, and it NEVER lets up. This can be seen as a virtue, but if you're unprepared for it, it could work the other way.Whether you love Moulin Rouge for its anachronism and explosiveness, or if you hate it, it can't be denied that Moulin Rouge is made by people with talent and vision. Luhrmann puts on a grand show, and his actors serve him very well indeed.Roxburgh copes well with the cliched Duke, while Broadbent is completely charismatic as Zidler. In the leads, Kidman and McGregor are outstanding. Although her vocals shake on the odd occasion, Kidman demands to be watched - her startling rendition of 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend' is magnificent, reminiscent of Marlene Dietrich, but she gleefully ditches the sophistication when she partakes wonderfully in the impromptu song-and-dance pitch for a play. McGregor is also enchanting as he perfectly captures the dreamy-eyed, romantic optimism of Christian. His voice is stunning, and he is an ideal hero. Broadbent, Kidman and McGregor all deserve Oscar noms for their work, and I wouldn't be surprised if Kidman takes one home.Other scenes to watch out for: the wonderfully executed tango to 'Roxanne', the show-stopping 'Like A Virgin' routine, a witty exchange of song lyrics between Kidman &amp; McGregor atop a huge bejewelled elephant, and an hilarious cameo from Kylie Minogue as a green sprite with a fondness for 'The Sound of Music'.Moulin Rouge takes advantage of the magic of cinema, a concept that is so often talked about, but rarely used with such conviction, originality and ambition. Allow it it's flaws, and appreciate its many virtues - a great show.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like two movies in one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem I had with Moulin Rouge is that it almost seems like Luhrmann shot two movies - one good, one bad - and had a blind person splice them together. The romance between McGregor and Kidman is very good, the chemistry is excellent. Their stuff works. What doesn't is the over the top musical numbers, especially the "Like A Virgin" number - oy, vey what was Baz thinking on that one? Cut about one-third of the musical numbers and the movie would rate around an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The musical journey of love was never this colourful. Unique andyet original, Moulin Rouge splash an episode of a writer (EwanMac Gregor) who fall in love with a top-notch beauty Satine (NicoleKidman).The satire and yet surrealis mode of the lavishing beauty ofeveryday life in Bohemian style was carefully carved and decoratedwith enormous collections of modern music adaptation. There-arrangement and restructuring of the musical compilationsproven to be relevant yet powerful to enhance the storyline andsparkling romance.It is a tragic fairy tale, so expect some unusual acts and turmoil,the movie was made specifically to glorious love, and only deathwhich can separate it but won't destroy it. The mood, the acts, theplots, expect not much from the casts, but the movie is still verymuch enjoyable.Take a close look towards the musical score, it is actually had abiggest grip towards building the emotions throughout the movie,and indeed it explodes in the credit title.A must for fantasy musical romance movie goers... a highlyrecommended movie to enjoy throughout the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank you Baz Luhrmann</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to put into words the true beauty of the film "Moulin Rouge". It is, for want of a better word, a masterpiece. In an age of movie mania where all movies seem to contain at least some similarites to the others. Moulin Rouge has broken this trend and it has done so in a way that is simply breathtaking. When I sat down to watch this film... I imagined it would simply be an all sining, all dancing musical converted into a film in order to attract a larger audience. How wrong I was. This film was a beautiful congregation of passion, love,faith, hope and, indeed, all things bohemian. The acting was superb. The singing was unbelievably moving. (Especially the duets between Kidman and McGregor). The writing was touching yet comical when the need for a break in the emotion was called for. However, the best aspect of the film by far was the amazing talent of the great Baz Luhrmann (Director). He brought every single bit of action and emotion to the audience. He allowed us all to feel emotions that the characters themselves were feeling. This, at times, brought many in the screen to tears. It takes a lot of talent to make a good film but everyone involved in this film deserves the recognition they deserve because, though somehow missed by the American critics, this film is a true classic. One thats legacy will most probably outlive it's stars and rightly so. Moulin Rouge is a modern day masterpiece. It is funny. Moving. Emotional. If you are one of these people who likes to look for flaws in films. You'll have to look very hard when watching this film. For those of you who are looking for a good night out. Turn down the lights. Open the wine. Bring in the popcorn and cuddle up to your partner because buy the end, You'll never want to let them go.</fullReview>

From the music to the acting to the stunning art direction, Moulin Rouge is an experience.This is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year, and while I was watching it two things came to mind: 1) "I can't wait to see this again" and 2) "I can't wait for this to come out on DVD".If you get the chance, see it.

		<fullReview>Last night, I saw Moulin Rouge! for the second time since it began its theatrical run. My girlfriend and I were pretty much alone in an old, delapidated, small-town movie theatre--you could hear the speakers annoyingly hissing with age during the previews. Suffice it to say that I was not expecting my second viewing of the film to be as powerful as the first. I found that the opening bit of craziness at the Moulin Rouge (with Zigler screaming, etc..) was a bit grating. Yet, once Ewan and Nicole start singing to each other, the movie grabs ahold of you and doesn't let go. These people seem to be so in love, it's incredible. I can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can be won over again and again by these two actors' brilliant performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never before have I enthused over ANY film as much as this one. I came to this site because I wanted to see if others enjoyed it as much as I did. I'm delighted to say that the majority of people feel the same way as me. I knew it was a Baz Luhrmann film, so I knew his approach would be different. So from the very beginning, he caught my attention.The film has everything, humour, wonderful singing, great songs produced entirely differently to how you've heard them before. Yes it's a simple love story, but what's wrong with that? It was delightful to sit back and just be entertained, without having to concentrate on following the plot. I've now been to see it a second time this week and have bought the soundtrack, which is getting played non stop. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys musicals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly overrated, but still good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After such supermovies this year, like 'Shrek' and 'le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain' (Amelie from Montmatre), claiming that this nice but decent movie is the years best one sounds simply absurd in my ears. I have to admit that this movie not even succeeded to be my favorite of the week !No question, the singing is okay, dialogue is good, and there are quite some nice jokes in it. But the movie does basically nothing but bathing the watcher in cliche, telling him or her such well hidden secrets such as 'there is nothing more important than love'. I really often felt quite bored by that.And the environment embarrassed me. The Moulin Rouge is actually nothing but a brothel in Paris ! A place where rich old men buy poor young girls. A prison. A shame for mankind. Whatever. But in the movie, it is treated with a glory as if it would be a kings palace !Too, many story parts couldn't raise my interest at all. The whole part with the jealously could, if at all, make me laugh. Whats the point there ? The man should have known that he is fallen into a whore ! What did he expect ? That she immediately transforms into an angel now ?In the end, 'Moulin Rouge' is nothing but a female counterpart to 'Fast and Furious'. Instead of action you get song and dance, and instead of coolness and freedom you get romance. But I liked the far more realistic characters from 'Fast and Furious' more than these boring stereotypes from 'Moulin Rouge'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The musical strikes back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it: Musical cinema sucks. Not counting Disney's animated musicals, you can count the good hollywood musicals of the last 30 years the fingers of one hand. Now Baz Luhrmann, king of camp, emperor of indulgence, gleefuly and effortlessly bucks the trend with a movie that's everything great about musicals. It's dazzling, hedonistic, spectacular and it lifts your soul up into the clouds.Set in bohemian Montmartre, around the turn of the last century, Moulin Rouge tells the story of a young writer (Ewan McGregor) who falls in love with a beautiful courtesan (Nicole Kidman) who seems way out of his league. It's a simple, tried and tested story. There's nothing challenging about this movie, and therein lies the secret of its success. The music is borrowed from 20th Century artists as diverse as the Beatles, Nirvana and Madonna and the plot is borrowed from a variety of sources such as "La Boheme" and "Midsummer Nights Dream". But throwing these elements into the mix with this degree of success is an achievement of sheer genius.Visually, Luhrmann pulls out all the stops and lets rip with a stunning display of effects. The result is breathtaking. This movie is up there with Jurassic Park and the Matrix in terms of redefining what technology can do for a movie. The scene in which we are introduced to the Moulin Rouge and it's proprietor is blinding. You feel you have to steady yourself for fear of falling out your seat and getting sucked into the screen.Of course, the danger of experimentation is that the results are often hit and miss. Fortunately there's 10 hits to every miss here. Highlights:The love medley that takes in David Bowie, Dolly Parton and the BeatlesThe dramatic highlight of the movie: RoxanneThe truly spectacular spectacular finale show9/10</fullReview>

I saw it four times and if it was still in the theatre and I had money I would see it again! I love the way Baz uses his camera as his paintbrush and shows us all the emotions and feeling the characters are experiencing with it. Ewan McGregor was amazing as the sweet and innocent Christian (Just look at his eyes!!! They are so genuine!). Many people are complaining about the simplicity of the plot. Well, quite honestly I didn't even notice. I was too astounded by the beauty and wonder of the film. I thought the plot was good actually. So what if it's been done before? Romeo and Juliet had been done a million times and Baz still found a way to make it brilliant and original. He did the same with this film. I don't see how anyone could dislike it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the first fifteen minutes of this movie, I was sure I had made a mistake. I was totally caught off guard, and the quick-cutting style of Luhrman made me dizzy and almost nauseous. But then, something magical happened. Nicole Kidman came on the screen, and the movie suddenly switched gears. It slowed down a bit (just a bit, but enough), and a love story began. Familiar songs, such as "Your Song" filled the theater. And suddenly, without warning, I fell in love with the movie. I couldn't believe the change from my initial reaction to my end reaction. I think some people absolutely hated this movie because they couldn't shake that initial reaction, whereas I sort of fell into the fantasy of the whole experience. Yes, it's silly that they're singing modern songs. Yes, it's silly that, at one point, they appear to float among the clouds while pixie dust sprinkles around them. But I accepted these as images, almost as metaphors, to help explain the excitement and beauty of the love story. To make a long story short, ignore the bad reviews and give the movie a chance--and stick around past the first 15 minutes--and you'll see that it's truly unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would really expect the most after "William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet". I would really expect the rebirth of the musical movie. But one thing doesn't let me score this movie higher than 7. I would also expect a better vision of Montmartre and Paris altogether. This movie lacks universe, because the action and the characters are too restricted. What I mean is that this musical lacks that epic vein it could have, because everything turns around that group of 5 or 6 people, that group of 4 or 5 buildings (the rest of the audience and the people are man with top hats and girls with dresses, let's face it) and the result is a grand musical film, but which is presented with the scenery range of a play (just count the scenes that don't take place on studio). And this is the thing that left me craving the most, since I think Luhrmann's nuts were really too big when he grabbed music from the 80's and put them in 1900. There are too many musical highlights, but if I could choose one that really touched me more than the others, it's gotta be the powerful "Tango de Roxanne", which is as achieved as any masterpiece song we ever heard, and works also as a summit to all the movie. This is my conclusion: the movie is great, could have been even better. Love those opening credits, though. And oh yeah, how on Earth did they managed to turn John Leguizamo into a midget? He looks real, there seems to be no digital manipulation or so!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well done musical.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The storyline is not complicated, however, this is a well done musical. It is unlike some of the musicals that I have seen which appear to be awkward when the characters try to sing. Those dialogues and songs are well integrated. The two main actors are exceptionally talented, they can really sing!I love all those nice songs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of the year!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw the movie I read about it in a magazine. The writer said it was the best movie of the year and that all the Oscars where already been taken for this movie. It will not receive all the Oscars, but at least the most important ones like best actor and actress, best movie, best music, best script etc. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I'm sure I will see it a few times more in the cinema. It is a fairy tail situated in Paris around 1900, it tells it feels like it tells the story of Freddy Mercury in a different body (Nicole Kidman)and in a different place and time. But in the end it only tells a story about LOVE (how stereotype this sound, that's what it really is about). This is the second movie I will reward with a 10. The first was The Matrix. I'm anxious to see this movie become a musical on Broadway in on other stages. Just see it and judge yourself.</fullReview>

Nicole Kidman is luminous - will also get a nomination nod though I think Renee Zillwiger is going to win for Bridget Jones's Diary.

		<fullReview>There are many who complained about the Moulin Rouge having no original score. Well my friends, the reason BAZ used pop culture tunes was to tell a story. Why is anyone scorned so much for telling a story in a different matter. This movie delivered exactly what it set out to do, a completely different way of telling a story with superior visuals. No acting some say? Where was there time during the movie for truly deep acting? The characters were exactly what they were supposed to be. No plot? It seemed straight forward to me. Poet falls in love with the star of the Moulin Rouge, she is loved by another man, she is torn between the show and love ect. I guess if it does not have explosions, teen stars, and tons of sex it isnt worth the american viewing audience. If you want a movie that is void of acting and class watch Planet of the Apes or the Final Fantasy movie.</fullReview>

Maybe it is, if you do like at least romance and love stories. I think it IS a movie for people who like musicals - especially the Andrew Lloyd Webber-style ones:"Moulin Rouge!" is very Webber-stylish. If you like musicals such as "Phantom of the Opera", "Cats" or "Evita" or Michael Kunze and Sylvester Levay's musical "Elisabeth" you will like "Moulin Rouge!", that's for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got around to see this film, I thought it would be a good film, boy, how wrong I was, it was a great film.It's a love story, but not only about love for another human being, but also for the love of art. Art in any sense, music, cinema, architecture, etc. Whichever form. All is being brought to us by the almost forgotten form of cinema, musical. The film-musical had it's prime during a time of depression and war, which main purpose was to give a little joy to the people. During the fifties and sixties, they tried to make them a little bit more serious or to take big Broadway productions to the screen. But by the summer of love the musical was as good as dead.So now we enter the 21st century and a whole generation doesn't know what movie-musicals are all about. They have never seen films with Gene Kelly - Judy Garland - Fred Astaire. What Baz Luhrman did was great, create a modern day version of "Singin' In The Rain", a film packed with modern classic songs. "Moulin Rouge" is the same concept as "Singin' In The Rain", old songs covered in a new story. The only distinction is that Baz Luhrman also gave the old songs a make-over. So we have a musical for the MTV-generation. It was a bold idea which happened to succeed perfectly.Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor and Jim Broadbent were wonderful. The art-direction, cinematography and costumes were spectacular and the choice of music terrific.In my eyes you can only hate this film, if you loath music or cinematography. But for me these forms of art are a basic human need, just like oxygen, food, water and love."Moulin Rouge" a lust for the eyes and ears. 10/10</fullReview>

Any one who is a movie freak, This one I give 9/out of 10 and recommend it. it lacks one because the beginning was badly opened. but you all will be quickly draw to it. Asid..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's so rare nowadays that a film combines great visual effectiveness with superb acting, so when two such films come along ('Moulin Rouge!' and 'Amelie') in the same month it really is a treat. Moulin Rouge! is so spectacular that it is just awe inspiring. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor's performances cap off a fabulous all round performance from the ensemble cast. The songs are just divine in the setting - particularly Roxanne and Like A Virgin - and the performances good. My only complaint is that the last reel drags a bit, as you wait for the impending finale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Baz's "Moulin Rouge!" is the final movie-theatrical-piece-of-art, and you know what?, it's also the best. From australian+gipsy "Strictly Ballroom", delirious "Romeu+Juliet" to this fantas-delirious "Moulin Rouge!", we have nothing to complain about.Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman definitely sing not only the songs, but their bodies and feelings as well in such a delicate and at the same time passionate way that we can only love the whole piece!The art direction is just......... super!music is... well, just listen to it! When you think that in the same hour you can have Nirvana and Elton John together, you just gotta hate it or kiss the guy who got the courage to go through with the idea!"Moulin Rouge!" is simple, as simple is this: you love it, hate it, or just didn't get the bohemian values, so it means nothing for you.My modest opinion: It's a great film, one of the top 3 of 2001, and it's sad that this is the end of Baz's "Red Curtain" movies. His work with Craig Pearce with the stories and dialogues has been great, and let's just hope for the best that they can give us in the future.For the present, enjoy the past of Paris, with a love story so tragic as delicate, a love story at the Moulin Rouge.And congratulations for the eternal and probably the best sentence of the last 3 years at movies:"the greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love, and be loved in return";) RIC</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you love excess...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An incredible sensory overload, 'Moulin Rouge!' sees Baz Luhrmann almost lose control of his own fertile imagination. The whole movie is a complete WOW! I haven't seen anything so creative, both in style, and content, for a long time. Everything about this movie screams excess, and that's what you get. There is so much going on that at times it is just too much. The first 20 minutes or so is a cacophony that takes a while to acclimatise to...but once you do you should be wrapped up in the whole experience.This is first truly musical musical in a very long time, with astonishing inventiveness applied to the script, the choice of songs, and the cinematography. The mixture of contemporary pop songs and turn of the century showmanship is inspired. Everyone involved gives 110%, especially the two leads who bravely dive straight into each song and survive with their dignity intact. Jim Broadbent almost steals the film, but it is such a collective effort that it would be unfair to mention it! Everyone (including 20th Century Fox) seems to have taken a leap of faith in making this movie, and it seems to have paid off. The only nagging doubt is that, with so many fancy trimmings, the emotional heart of the story is suffocated.A must-see twice movie, because first time round you'll be reeling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>energy driven by easy love, if not rythm...Alas!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love, Love, Love...it seems to be the only purpose of this musical... True, the action and settings are really great; everything is in excess of everything: it is nervous, vibrating, loud (sometimes too loud). It's cacophonic in the first half hour, so that you lose almost all contact with the story, but you later get back on your feet. But when you consider the plot, it's really predictable. If a simple story is not really a problem for the first half of the film, with so many other things occupying your mind, it becomes a big one when the action is slowing down in the second part. Here you discover the one-sided face of the characters, the simplicity of the script at a whole : the total weakness of the second role characters (never seen such an insignificant Toulouse-Lautrec in a Montmartrian movie...), and the relatively small variety in settings starts to really suck towards the end. The movie is promising at the beginning, but end in a very loose way due to a total lack of rythm, if not love!!! Amelie is far more fun and captivating, if you want to deal with the "Paris-clichés" romances...without the boring. I give 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indeed a musical for people who don't like musicals.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a spin! Moulin Rouge! is beyond anything ever before. A perfect mixture of love and musical, drama and dance, comedy and cabaret. It uses whatever it likes from modern music, and tosses away everything it doesn't like about musicals and theater. (Eat this Saturday Night Fever!)The images strike you first, with amazing zooms and spins and cuts, the story is highly paced and perfectly timed with the charming, funny and sometimes even heartwarming. (Wait a second. Gonna shed a little tear here)The plot is downright idioticly simple, but the mixture of different genres and funny twists, the anarchy and the daring, makes you forget that. Hell. The lovestory of this film is topped only by pieces such as "Edward Scissorhands" and "Bram Stoker's Dracula". And right now, even that seems debatable!The actors are all great, and they perfectly portray the image of good, evil, love, desire and most of all SHOWTIME!!!Baz Luhrmann has overdone himself this time, and it seems to me, that his career can ONLY be downhill from here.10/10 - shut up and go see the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Again the story of Traviata</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who think that the era of the great musicals is over will see their opinion denied by this movie which combines the old musical tradition with a lot of digital special effects more adequate to the animation movies but which match with the general purpose of this movie anyway. The editing mainly in the first part shows an overwhelming speed of successive plans almost psychedelic playing successfully with images and sounds and showing spectacular choreographic scenes. In the second part that image rhythm slows down a bit more accordingly with the dramatic plot that develops itself around a Traviata love story of the tb ridden courtisan and the young poor but talented writer. Near the end there is a fabulous musical dance with an Argentinian theme which makes counterpoint with the dramatic scene where the courtisan is going to sacrifice herself to the lust of the rich Duke who is financially supporting the show. The weakest part of the movie is the soundtrack mostly made of more modern melodies like "The Sound of Music" which have nothing to do with the movie supposed era. Their inclusion results in an anachronism which we cannot understand. This movie could be better but is good enough anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to the movies to watch this. I was impressed because of Satine (Nicole Kidman). She is so beautiful. Nicole Kidman is always great. Her performances are amazing, except for (Practical magic). I'll never forget her performance in my favorite movie "The portrait of a lady" by Jane Campion. She was excellent. It was definitely her best performance. She should have won an academy award for best actress in the portrait of a lady. Anyway it doesn't matter now. I hope she will win an academy award for best actress in a leading role this year since she hasn't ever been nominated for one. Hopefully she will be the Oscar winner this time for "Moulin Rouge". The story is stunning as well as the performances and the music played. it was kind of modern. The scenery is very flashy as well. The windmill was an excellent instrument for making this film. This makes it different and interesting. Ewan Macgregor was OK. But I really didn't like that much his performance as a poet. In fact I really didn't like one part of this movie. It's that the movie shows the ending at the beginning. I was so disappointed. The ending was obvious in it because Christian (Ewan Macgregor) begins telling the story of Satine a smoldering temptress who is in love with him, but she finally dies because of a disease. It didn't make sense. Christian told us the story, but he first told us about Satine death. I mean it'd have been much better if he wouldn't have told us anything at the beginning. The movie lost interest after finding out that she was going to die. It was the worst thing about this movie. Anyway even though it failed on it. I think it was the best story about love ever told. The dancers and the music were amazing as well as the climate, we could see all the seasons like winter, summer, etc. I'll never forget when Satine told him that she didn't love him because she loved the duke instead.At last this is a great movie, but it shouldn't have told us the ending at the beginning. It's worth watching just for music and drama-romance lovers. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was La Boheme - with a serious twist. I thought the parallelisms were sweet. I loved the tome and atmosphere of the movie. The stage came alive and you felt like you were there. And just as the Moulin Rouge played popular music of the day. So did this. The scenery took you back to a place you'd never been and the music was intended to make you feel as if this was your Moulin Rouge. As if then were now and vice versa. T.S. Eliot's "objective correlative" if you will. The problem is that I felt thrown off by the medley of popular love songs. It felt out of place, out of time and out of character to me instead of drawing me in - which I believe was it's intended purpose. Still I have a good deal of professional respect for the gutsy decision to take that chance. The movie itself is full of lively vibrant characters and the scenery and costumes are gaudy to the point of storybookish. Worth seeing, if only for the sake of interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not too fond of musicals, I don't like soppy love stories with predictable endings and I am not a frequent visitor of posh brothels either. Still, I was simply dazzled by Moulin Rouge.The first fifteen minutes of the movie were very fast and flashy, almost music video-like. Some (middle aged) people right next to me in the cinema started shifting around their chairs uneasily, but I'm sure they got what they waited for after a short while anyway. I didn't mind the beginning at all, I thought it was a very clever way of portraying the chaotic and lively atmosphere in the famous nightclub.After the initial chaos died down a bit, the viewer got a tragic love story about the poor English writer Christian (McGregor) who falls in love with the posh dancer Satine (Kidman) in the famous Parisian nightclub Moulin Rouge. However, she has to be the lover of a very rich duke who pays for the production of Spectacular spectacular, the new Moulin Rouge show. This is a story about a poor sitar player who falls in love with a courtisane, but she has to marry the wealthy maharadja. The parallel is clear, I think. Satine and Christian start a secret affair, but the jealous duke gets suspicious and does anything to stop the passionate love affair between the two. The premiere of Spectacular spectacular is a tragic climax of the love story: will Satine choose for the duke's money, or follow her heart for the first time and leave Moulin Rouge together with Christian?It is not the story that makes Moulin Rouge such an interesting picture, it is in the incredible way it is told. Fabulous camera shots, interesting use of classic and modern pop songs (Madonna's Material girl and The Police's Roxanne will never be the same) and most of all, very good acting and singing of the two heroes, Kidman and McGregor. Never knew they could sing at all, so I was a bit sceptical about this aspect of the film beforehand. But I must admit I was quite impressed, particularly with McGregors efforts. Give 'em both and Oscar, and the person who cast Miss Minogue: give him two (for his guts).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If "The Matrix" redefined and reinvigorated the action movie then "Moulin Rouge!" should reinvent the musical genre. It is visually sumptuous and amazing and the lyrics and prose sample from many many songs but are interweaved so well that it is seamless. It takes many more than one viewing to catch the references too. All the leads are excellent but once again Jim Broadbent is a scene stealer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one musical love story I wouldn't miss for a life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I came out of the theater shocked, thrilled, sad, amazed, literally with my jaw somewhere in the ankle area. I never thought that a musical (I think that is what they call such movies) could appeal to me so strongly, none to say a love story. Moulin Rouge was imho the best love story I have ever had the privilege to watch. Many of them are typical, only the scenery changes. Here the scenery is blown to such shocking contents that you feel as if being in a theme park of some sort. And it's not a crappy theme park. After a movie, besides the "feel" of it I always try to analyze it's good and it's bad points. After Moulin Rouge I could not find any weak points. The directing was great (thx Buz :), the acting (I could not imagine a better line up, all the roles were great), the COSTUMES, the scenery, the drama! I hope you won't take me for a freak but I just came back from THE SHOW and I'm still hot over it.You will have many great moments while watching this movie, from mad laughter, through sadness, despair to contemplation. Great job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has the look and feel of a Disney animation/live action movie. The plot and the storyline are very similar to Disney movies. Even the singing reminds of animation films like The Lion King. This is a kid's movie. The only part I liked is almost at the ending where Satine and the Duke have to 'consummate' their relationship. For the rest it's pretty bland and unsurprising and that counts for photography, story and setting. I recommend Terry Gilliam movies if you want some real substance.</fullReview>

We, especially her, had been wanting to see it for a while. After the movie was over, we were spellbound! The music was tremendous and catchy. We literally could not stop singing the songs all week while in Hawaii. On the way back from Hawaii, guess what movie was playing again! We both looked at each other like 2 little kids and quickly grabbed our headsets so we could watch it a second time. The story is beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. I highly recommend seeing it with an open mind. Seeing this movie with a closed mind will ruin its beauty. Remember, "All you need is love!".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge! has affected me in a way that no movie has done for ages. This one has really gotten under my skin. Like all the true greats it is something that you've never quite seen the like of before, and it works so well because it is brilliant on many different levels.High praise for a movie that I approached with some skepticism and was ready to dismiss as a white elephant after the first fifteen minutes. Let me put the record straight - a white elephant it most certainly is not, and the first song and dance routine between Nicole Kidman and Ewen McGregor simply blew me away. I was left sitting slack-jawed with amazement in state of total sensory overload and gagging for more.And more I got... the movie delivers a constant supply of magical moments throughout and the roller-coaster does not stop until the credits roll... and then you want to go again.Visually stunning, musically brilliant, funny and sad in equal measures with a vocal performance from McGregor so unexpectedly brilliant that it casts a shadow of doubt over the next Star Wars movie. I for one do not want to see it unless I'm promised an all singing and dancing Obi-Wan. Ewan will find it hard to make a better movie than Moulin Rouge!This movie is terminally cool and I can't wait to see it again. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful One-Third of a Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was first subjected to repeated viewings of the "Moulin Rouge" trailer (which preceded repeated viewings of "Memento"), I swore that I would only watch it if someone paid me, say, ten dollars to (above and beyond admission, transportation, and popcorn). It looked to be the worst of Romance and Musical distilled into one dire waste of celluloid.But then I started hearing good things. Enough good things that I eventually dragged myself down to the two-dollar theatre to see it(after having procrastinated for a week or two in the hope it would finish its run and save me the hassle).So, you know, I'm not expecting much. I'm fully prepared to walk out; heck, I didn't even buy popcorn. So I'm rather surprised to find that within the first minute I'm thinking, "you know this isn't half as bad as I'd thought it would be." And by the time twenty, thirty minutes have elapsed, I'm thinking my God this is GREAT, how could I almost have missed seeing this film, I am going to sing its praises from the rooftops, *force* the unenlightened to go see it (see "Memento", above).And then, apparently, the plot kicks in. The part most people seem to enjoy the most. The endless repetition of a few choice utterly banal lyrics set to an absolutely unmemorable tune. That's right: the worst of Romance and Musical distilled into one dire waste of two-thirds of a movie's worth of celluloid. What can I say, truth in advertising.Still, the first third was so great that it sticks in my mind almost a week later, makes me want to see it again. I'm contemplating forming a first-third-of-Moulin-Rouge fan club...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this film sounded okay when I first heard of it, and then I saw the trailer. I decided it sounded a bit heavy going, and so ignored it for the first week of release. Then I saw the trailer again when I went to see something else, and read a brilliant review of it, and so thought again. And I'm so glad I did!This film is incredible. Nicole sings like an angel, but it's Ewan who's the real surprise - if he made an album, it would probably be ridiculed, but he has a real talent. It's not fair, really - gorgeous, sexy as hell, amazing voice, brilliant actor, and knicker-meltingly sexy Scottish accent to boot! His wife is a bloody lucky woman!The film has wonderful sets, a fantastic cast, and the songs are brilliant. The original songs, eg. Come What May (a beautiful ballad between Satine and Christian) are spectacular, and the working of modern classics such as Your Song and Roxanne into the fibres of the film is cleverly and expertly done. SEMI SPOILER: At the end, you can't help crying when Satine dies (this is only a bit of a spoiler because Christian says in the first five minutes that she's dead), because the acting is so spectacular, it's like someone you know and love. SPOILER DONE. When it finished, everyone in the cinema sat still for about the first thirty seconds of the credits - something I've never seen happen before, and I go to the cinema on a pretty regular basis. Really, it was kind of funny - the cynical British public, brought to a complete standstill by a film.That is why if you haven't seen this film, YOU HAVE TO!!!!!!!!! Not to sound too mushy, but it really touches you inside, even moreso than Romeo + Juliet. Roll on Baz Luhrmann's fourth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really have to say that Moulin Rouge is, so far, the best film i've seen this year. It really gave me confidence that cinema can still produce wonderful movies. Moulin Rouge is such a wonderful experience to watch. Everything, from the beautiful sets, bizar cinematography excellent soundtrack and wonderful acting is flawless. It's such an amazing achievement. The story itself, centering on the love-affair between Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor may be old, it may be unoriginal, but it's told in such an entertaining way that it never becomes irritating or dull. And credit for this achievement should be given especially to the main characters, Nicole and Ewan. They really shine in this picture, not only acting extremely well, but also singing extremely well. They've succeeded in making the story seem fresh and original simply by acting so well.And then I have to say that this movie is the first one wich in my eyes really deserves an oscarsweep this year, or at least get a lot of nominations(male &amp; female performance, art-direction, cinematography, costumes). This movie contains everything that makes cinema great, makes you laugh, cry, and brings you in a state of awe that won't leave you quickly.Beautiful, original, wonderful, captivating etc. etc. Moulin Rouge is the cumulation of everything that makes cinema great!!! 10/10</fullReview>

By the end of the movie I was going over what I had just seen and I was stunned. Stunned by the skill of the director. How does one, or many for that matter, orchestrate such a magnificent scene, such as Christian's first night at the Moulin Rouge? Then how does one string hundreds of similar scenes together to form such a `Spectacular Spectacular' Movie?I keep going back to the first bedroom scene where Satine and Christian fall in love and think to myself. Oh my god, I really like that Elton John song. I must have replayed that scene a hundred times by now. For this scene alone it is worth buying this movie.</fullReview>

Nicole Kidman is captivating, but easily draws second next to the charm, the voice and the talent that is Ewan McGregor. This story is not a movie. It is a dream.

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge! starts with a tell-tale scene of a conductor working himself in a sweat conducting an imaginary orchestra before large curtains.Expecting a pseudo-historical romantic view of turn-of-the-century Paris, I got thrown into a turbulent vaudeville. Instead of a voyeuristic approach the director had the guts to actually throw me smack in the middle of the actual stage without so much as a warning.At first I plucked my eyebrows but it was simply irresistible. Moulin Rouge! is loud, outrageous... and deeply moving.The heart of the movie is a classic opera-style tale filled with romance, deceit, treachery and death. The form however is far removed from anything I have ever seen. The musical accompaniment is a skillful medley right across twentieth century music. What to think of a room filled with men in cylinder hats dancing to "Smells Like Teen Spirit" by Nirvana?. If Verdi lived in our time, would this have been his approach? Who knows, and who cares. I could never get enough of this exuberant, rich and yet somehow sober performance.The acting is excellent, with outstanding roles by Nicole Kidman and Jim Broadbent. The director is both ubiquitous and subtly withdrawn. Ubiquitous in the loving care that went into every detail. Withdrawn in the strict adherence to the self-set rules of the story and the way it is told. Not once do you tell yourself: "Hey wait a minute, this is a movie! I am sitting in a theatre, and this isn't real!"The story is told in one long trait. At the intermission I actually felt like having had desert, and still had half the movie to go.To finish off the compliments, the movie, besides being a real tearjerker, is simply great fun. You can't miss the scenes where the rotund theatre director sings "Like a Virgin". And it works!Don't miss Moulin Rouge!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect!! Awesome!! Incredible!!! Superb!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky this summer because I was in Australia and I could see this wonderful movie before it arrives in Spain, and I really became in love with it. I´m a big fan of musicals, and I could say this one is the best one I´ve ever seen. The performances of all the actors are great, Nicole Kidman surprised me, I couldn´t imagine she was such a great actress, and Ewan, with dark hair, does here one of his greatest jobs.I like that frenetic and non-ending rythym that takes all the film since its beginnings, it is perfect, all the songs, especially "Come what may", took my breath away, there´s no one day in which I don´t sing "Come what may". I fell in love with Nicole.A great digital cinematography wraps the film with an incredible colorful atmosphere. The script is great, the music, the choreographies,oh, I wish I was there!, I couldn´t imagine a movie as perfect as this one. It really reached my heart.The other team is very well cast, John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent, Richard Coxburg, Caroline O´Connor, they are all great, I couldn´t forget that story of the maharaja,with all that dancers that turned Nicole into a goddess ("she´s mine") and the Big Elephant.There´s so many wonderful things in that movie that I could write lots of books. I´ll never forget Nicole on the top of the elephant singing "I´ll fly away", or Ewan singing "your song". They are not singers, but they are a couple of great voices apart from their acting. Fortunately great singers have collaborated in doing the wonderful soundtrack, Bono, David Bowie, Beck, Valeria,Fatboy Slim, Mya, etc .Their songs fits perfectly with that story, and the lyrics make it more credible than ever.But I insist in the script, is perfect, those lines like: "I´m not a duke, I´m a writer!" or "Tell our story Christian, this will be the only way we´ll be together" or "Love is like oxygen" surprised me, especially the second one, which brought deep emotions to my heart. I won´t forget the day I saw this movie. I don´t know if I´m in love with Satine or Nicole, I think with the two of them. I recommend this movie to all people who likes musicals, frenetic dance, deep stories, and above all, love. The greatest thing you´ll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return. Moulin Rouge is without doubts, my third favourite movie, and I´m very proud it is Australian,(I´m Australian) and not a Hollywood product as lots of people think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been almost a week since I've seen this film, and I still cannot get over how stunning the experience was. No doubt, I will see it again this weekend, and it's funny to me that as much of a ride the film was, there are many parts that I do not remember. Perhaps that was part the joy, of being taken for such a wild rush that everything becomes a blur. From when the curtains lifted (people who have seen the film will know what I mean) to the very end, I was absolutely transfixed. The director here did a flawless job of transporting the audience to another time and place, that despite its surrealness and displacement of time and culture, felt very real. Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman and the entire cast was brilliant, but the real star here are the images that the director delivers to us. A seamless stich of computer animation and sound stages, Technicolor and grainy B&amp;W, the visual pyrotechnics need to be seen and experienced to be believed. Echoing a statement from another IMDB user, I would feel very sorry for you if you do not enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reinvention of the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My deep love of the cinema embraces most genres, but the musical is probably my least favourite. Yet Australia director, co-producer, and co-writer Baz Luhrmann has virtually reinvented the genre with this visual extravaganza which has furious pacing, stunning sequences and startlingly fresh versions of recent songs as well as older ones. Nicole Kidman has never looked more striking than as the French courtesan Satine, while Ewan McGregor, the writer, and Richard Roxburgh, the Duke, are fine if theatrical as the two suitors with their rival offerings of love and riches respectively. This is a movie which it's hard not to like, such is its exuberance and charm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All good films have to be good on at least one level.Gladiator was an epic, American Beauty ironic, Priscilla Queen of the Desert kooky, Delicatessan original, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon beautiful, Kes sad, Chocolat romantic and Shrek plain funny.Moulin Rouge manages to be all of these at the same time(maybe not an epic!). The scenery and characterisations are enchanting, the notion of displacing music could have been disasterous, but worked out just fine. In fact, it was what Topsy Turvy should have been (Jim Broadbent please note).It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but after the nightmare of New York this week, Moulin Rouge was a terrific piece of escapism in the grand manner. 10 out of 10 without hesitation. Baz Luhrmann goes into my book with Sam Mendez and Stephen Poliakoff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Perfection!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I came out of the cinema stunned. This is cinema taken to the edge. Presenting the performance as if we were sitting in a live theatre. The colours are incredible, so bright and vivid. Excellent settings and costumes. The essence of the age was captured so well. OK, so the singing voices aren't perfect, but the way the songs were intertwined was witty and amusing. And for a thirty something like myself I amused myself trying to spot the various song titles throughout the film. I can also understand the negative criticism. If musicals aren't your cup of tea this film would be dire. Indeed I was reluctant to go and see it and this is the only failing: i.e. as it is a musical it will put people off. But if you open your eyes to this feast of a cinematic presentation then this film will be very hard indeed to better. Here's hoping Nicole Kidman gets an Oscar nomination, as well as various members of the production team from the director to designers. A brilliant piece not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What cinema is all about!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bleary evening in London was threatening at which point the idea of seeing Moulin Rouge was cast in my direction. Not having heard much of it, knowing about the famous night-spot in Paris and having seen a less than invigorating trailer left me a little unsure. I gave into peer pressure and we took our seats.From the very beginning of this movie I was hooked. It was the saline in my cinematic drip from minute one to minute 127. Left brain-dead by the usual Hollywood fare, this rocked me into consciousness and had me by the short and curlies all the way through.You can read elsewhere the details of the plot, so I'll refrain from a refrain, but if you are after an all-out cinematic assault in the way cinema was intended, then you need to see this movie. Not only is it a welcome break from the more moronic Hollywood releases of, well, most of the time, it is a genuine emotional rollercoaster and visual triumph. Mash that in with glorious pastiche, sharp wit, spellbinding set dressing, photography and choreography and you have a real treat.Don't be put off by the fact that it is a musical. It is a musical triumph. In fact everything worked so well that I was left floundering in my seat until the end of the credits, as was nearly everyone else in the cinema. Extraordinarily refreshing movie making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MOULIN ROUGE (2001) Rating: 10/10The new diabolical movie is out! It's the movie everyone should rush to the cinema to see! Yes, Moulin Rouge! Wow, just see how enthusiastic a movie can make you? It'll make you tingle with excitement and flutter with joy? That is the kind of feeling you get when you're watching Moulin Rouge, a endlessly enjoyable piece of filmmaking from Baz Luhrmann, who bought us the similar Romeo + Juliet in 1996. Luhrmann has created with his script and his immaculate direction a near-perfect slice of grand cinema. Nicole Kidman's performance is stunning, its about time she got a role like this, and the actress hasn't been so good or so daring since To Die For. Ewan McGregor is also his best in ages, lighting up off-screen with his narration and sparkling when he's acting on-screen. The costumes are delicious, the makeup is eye-catching, the editing is fabulous and the cinematography is just beautiful. The singing and songs are extremely strong and add to the movie's many good points. Seeing these actors recite some extremely famous romantic songs is at times funny and at others heartbreaking. Moulin Rouge is breathtakingly romantic, visually stunning and brilliantly offbeat, it is my favourite movie of 2001 and one of the best musicals of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Baz, it's okay if a shot lasts for more than half a second - really, it's okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's also okay if we hear more than sixteen uninterrupted consecutive bars of the one song.I don't want to give the impression that "Moulin Rouge" is a bad movie, or even that I didn't enjoy it. Of course I enjoyed it. It's impossible not to. But it's an entertaining trifle rather than ... I don't know, rather than whatever it was trying to be. Luhrmann's earlier "Strictly Ballroom" is probably more the thing "Moulin Rouge" was reaching towards. It has the same unbridled cinematic hedonism, but with more depth, more coherence, certainly more sincerity. We're told more than once that this is a story of "truth, beauty, freedom, and above all, love". But the film has little to say about freedom and nothing whatever to say about truth and beauty - those three were thrown in simply to make up the numbers. Besides, what does the slogan MEAN? When the Bohemians announce that "truth" is one of their ideals, are they saying that one ought to tell the truth, or discover the truth, or face the truth, or are they speaking aesthetics, and saying something about art being true to life? Your guess is as good as mine.As for the editing - did Luhrmann HAVE to disfigure his fine creative work so much? A lot of the art direction is fantastic, but we can only find out that it's fantastic by a process akin to forensic science. We never get an uninterrupted look at anything. And even WITHIN the rare uncut shots, there's the appearance too much frantic cut-and-paste. This is exactly what people feared would happen when editors started to use laptops rather than scissors. With many movies it doesn't matter, but in this case Luhrmann could have made something special, if he hadn't put it through a blender.Don't let me dissuade you from seeing it (as if I could). You're bound to have fun. You'll be introduced to a lovely fantasy world (albeit one that feels only just large enough to hold the story Luhrmann tells), and there's no denying that the cast strain every muscle, nor that Luhrmann is inventive - and what's more, ambitious. The film wouldn't be as good as it is were it not for his admirable desire to make a lavish masterpiece along the lines of, and worthy of being placed alongside, such films as "The Children of Paradise" and "The Red Shoes". But has he succeeded? Not even close.</fullReview>

Ewan McGregor is absolutely fantastic as an innocent and overly sentimental lovesick puppy (who knew the guy could sing like that?!), and Nicole Kidman´s cold beauty mirrors that of the leading ladies of old Hollywood. The direction, costume design, cinematography and musical numbers are to die for... it´s wild, it´s crazy and at times absolutely hillarious (highlights?

		<fullReview>This movie is great art. It revived my faith in the medium of film and it revived my faith in humanity.I went into it not caring much for Nicole Kidman and expecting that the anachronistic use of modern pop songs would be a travesty. Boy, was I wrong, on both counts. Kidman was utterly fantastic (she has got to win an Oscar!) and the use of pop songs was delightful. Ewan McGregor? Well, I liked him OK before, but he captured my heart in this. He was beautiful and luminous. Everyone was. They let their lights shine. That's thanks to Baz Luhrmann. He helped them to open up and do the weird scary stuff, like singing (which was so moving that it brought me to tears many times). Yes, the script was negligible but look what they did with it! Compare, for instance, to "Phantom Menace", which was an exercise on how to degrade the talents of wonderful actors."Moulin Rouge" isn't a perfect film by any means -- there's a section in the middle that feels disconnected and choppy, and I wish there was more dancing shown -- but no great work of art is completely perfect.If this movie doesn't win a cartload of Oscars then there's no justice in the world. But even if it doesn't, I'll still treasure it. Like the best films of all time, it catapults you to a different universe and brings you back changed for the better.Another opinion: my husband, a musician who has played in so many musicals that he hates the genre (and almost never sees movies more than once), has seen it twice. He thinks it's the best movie musical ever made. We can't wait for the DVD to come out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ultra-romantic, operatic in the grandeur of its ambitions, gorgeous to look at, musically astounding, witty and exuberant, endlessly inventive, and loads of fun, Moulin Rouge floored me. I don't think I have enjoyed a movie as much since my childhood, meaning that it transported me out of this world into its own unique universe the way Saturday matinees (didn't matter what was playing) did when I was a child. (This is not to claim that Moulin Rouge is as great as, let's say, Grand Illusion; but there are different kinds of masterpieces.) Kidman and McEwan are both splendid and of course both are splendid to look at. The supporting cast is uniformly superb, John Leguizamo especially endearing as Toulouse Lautrec. Sets, costumes are a delight. The film's musical director and whoever did the orchestrations/arrangements should both win the Nobel Prize in Music (if there were such a prize); musically Moulin Rouge is an absolute tour-de-force. I certainly can understand why some people might hate this movie (those, for example, with no sense of romance or humor; or those who find opera or, say, musical theatre, inherently ridiculous). And I know it's a much over-used word . . . but Baz Luhrmann is clearly a genius.</fullReview>

With its gorgeously-detailed sets, swooping cameras, wild colors, and soaring music, MR needs to be seen on the same scale that it's presented. Suspend your disbelief when you walk in the theater door, sit back, and take it in. You're stepping into a different world.But not so different that it keeps the heart of the film from ringing true. Kidman and McGregor are are both breathtaking, and they sold me on their characters...and, most important, on each other's characters.And bonus--in this day and age, a film set in a hedonistic nightclub with no gratuitous sex and no gratuitous violence? It's shocking. Absolutely shocking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what a terrible movie - badly acted (with the notable exemption of Ewen McGregor who was the only good thing about the movie). I believe the movie relied too much on being clever and surreal rather than relying on what were interesting locales and an interesting story that didn't require so much razzle dazzle - extremely disappointing and overrated movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why some people don't like this film. Everyone I know found it at least to be entertaining. I was "knocked out" by its humor, clever use of music and even using lyrics occasionally as spoken dialogue. It was visually stunning. It was well cast, and the performances were very impressive. To those who complain that Ewan MacGregor lent all the real emotion to the story, may I point out what should be obvious because it's inherent to the script...there is meant to be a big difference between the two characters...a wide-eyed, innocent, romantic poet should seem more emotional than a jaded, worldly courtesan. And it is written from Ewan's character's viewpoint. Nicole expressed her character's emotions very believably, and she was funny in the humorous moments. I hope she chooses comedies more often than she has so far in her career. And finally, for the "Like A Virgin" number alone, this film was fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern cinematic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of silent cinema, it strikes me as odd that I liked so much this movie. Then again, there is a very good reason for this.During the silent cinema golden era, visionary directors such as Fritz Lang, F.W. Murnau and others created bizarre interpretations of our world. They effectively expanded our perceptions by incorporating cinematic tricks, such as slanted angles, futuristic sets, chiaroscuro shots, and others.Moulin Rouge should be grouped among these movie wonders.This is cinematic art at its very best. The cinematography is fast, furious, and concise. Gripping. It locks your attention to the movie like no other I remember watching...(From now on, the review is *Chock full of spoilers*). ... for example, the opening shot, which is a movie theater within a movie theater, projecting an old movie of an old Moulin Rouge, with a music director conducting an orchestra playing the 20th Century Fox fanfare. Marvelous. The ending shot, with the gun flying overhead the Moulin Rouge and crashing with the Eiffel Tower. The entire depiction of the Moulin Rouge is amazing. The genius of the main character singing "Your Song" to the prostitute. "Roxanne" by The Police as a tango. Sheer geniality.Oh, and in case you are wondering, yes, there is a plot. And the ending is simply beautiful.You cannot miss it. It is a shoo-in for a perfect ten. It gets a 9, though, because I don't know how it will stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am obsessed with this film. I cannot stop thinking about it, singing the music, dreaming about it. When I saw the movie for the first time, I said that I would not go back to see it again because it was TOO much! Too depressing, too agitating, too visually stimulating, too cacophonous! But, that I might return to see it just to hear music. I have seen the film a total of 13 times before it left Hawaii and I would continue to see it if it were still playing here. The story is beautiful. The writers have done a wonderful job. I cannot imagine any other director doing this movie in any other way than how Baz directed it. Nicole and Ewan are magical. I cannot praise Ewan's singing abilities enough. He has such a beautiful voice! This is truly a "Spectacular Spectacular"!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Musical - EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I've been a professional and semi-professional musician for over twenty years and an avid movie fan for over thirty years, most musicals have always bored me. Except for Jesus Christ Superstar, I don't think I've ever seen any more than once. That is until today. Moulin Rouge grabbed a hold of me and would not let go! Only five or ten minutes into the movie I knew I was in for a real treat. By the time we had reached the half-way point, I knew that I already wanted to see it again. And again I did. Immediately following the conclusion of the movie, I ran to the lobby to purchase another ticket. While I had heard Nicole Kidman sing a few bars before, nothing prepared me for the real talent she has. Furthermore, to listen to Ewan McGregor sing was worth the price of admission alone. Not only does this movie make great use of modern music (some very modern and some recently modern) but it utilizes musical bits and pieces and storylines from other movies, plays, and even operas. You'll even find lyrics from songs you may know being sung to different melodies and to other familiar tunes as well. Watch closely, you may even see a few parodies of some other familiar characters, too. It seems the more you know about music, movies, and the theatre, the more fun you'll have with this wonderful gem. This one's the next in line for my video collection!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific but depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The way the film started off was very interesting, as it was like a play of some sort and was in an old style from the early 20th century. The first half of the film was amazing, "spectacular, spectacular!" even. The film was vibrant for the most part and has interesting combinations of music ("Because We Can" and "Lady Marmalade" at the same time) and the way the characters interact with each other is amazing. However, they give away a major plot point before the first five minutes were over. The whole story was told in flash back, which I personally don't like as one can tell what will occur in the story from how the character is in the beginning. The humor is interestingly different from the norm and is very unique. The musical numbers are primarily in the first hour or so and the vibrant way it is shot shows the emotions the characters were feeling. Then the film turns to a darker point and is very different form the beginning. While the ending seemed to perk up, all of a sudden it turned back to the sadder side. Overall, I still enjoyed the film but it is more of a romantic film then the comedy side shown. The musical aspect was new and very good and I would recommend most people to this film.</fullReview>

This film reaffirms that no matter how silly love is, no matter how we know it might hurt us, how cliched it is, we can't deny that we'd rather experience it.This film is beautifully made with great acting from Nicole, Ewan and all the other Supporting Casts especially Jim Broadbent. The editing is wonderful, the art direction, the costume, the songs, acting and the Directing deserve to be acknowledged come the Academy Awards.One of the best film I've ever had the pleasure to experience in my life, Moulin Rouge is a sure front runner for the Best Picture of the Year!

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is a cinematic marvel of modern editing techniques and classic Movie Musical flair. Combining the pageantry and wonder of the movie musicals of the 40's and 50's with the digital effects of today, Moulin Rouge manages a visual masterpiece that can only be described as tasty eye candy. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are surprisingly good in their vocals, lifting common pop songs from the past couple of decades to an elevated Musical Score format. The film plays at a quick pace that may be difficult for the older viewing audience to grasp, but is definitely in line with what today's younger audience comes to expect from combined music and video. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who likes creativity and love stories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far the best movie I have seen since 1999. I wanted to see it since I saw the first trailer simply due to my affinity for musicals, but I had no idea what I was in for. It was the best musical every put to screen. They managed to capture all the theatrical elements while still effectively employing cinematic elements. And Ewan MacGregor's voice should not be ignored any longer. He was born to sing. And as we already knew he is one heck of an Actor. I was never a big Nicole Kidman fan, but she blew me away as well. And with a supporting cast of relative unknowns (save John Leguizamo) they all played their parts to a tee. Mr. Leguizamo showed us his voice talents as well. Again totally unexpected.See this movie.

All the blockbusters have failed and not lived up to expectations. The others films I 'd rate as good are Shrek, Atlantis, Spy Kids, and Dr. Doolittle 2. But Moulin Rouge was AWESOMELY fun and entertaining.Hands down, this movie is the movie with the MOST. Comedy, drama, music, dancing, intrigue, suspense, and love. What more?? There's Passion, Love, Freedom, oh wow!! This is sure to be a RENTAL classic. I mean, it really doesn't get any better than this.Ewan can SInG. Yes he can. He's handsome, cute, funny, and irresistable. Nicole Kidman is a perfect partner for him. The Can Can dancing is so fun and enjoyable that I watched this movie over 10 times. The acting is so good that I laughed, cried, and sang with every viewing.The story is not fantastic or earthshattering but it is 10 times better than many of the stuff Hollywood puts into the market. This was 50% Hollywood and 50% artistic/literary film. I cannot hold my enthusiasm for this movie as it totally took my emotions and soul for a wonderful ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie seems to generate comments that are extreme one way or the other. If you 'get it' - you'll love it. Some people just don't 'get it'. Many people complain about it's lack of plot, or overly simplified storyline.There is a clever multiple layered story, the movie is about itself. Christian is a penniless artist - a writer specifically, writing a story which reflects his own story, about a penniless artist &amp; his lover. The second time I saw it I realised that quite early in the movie he tells us the ending of the movie, just a quick line that I missed the relevance of first time. It is all the more tasty when the movie anti-hero needs some prompting to see that the story played out in front of him is also happening around him, and he still doesn't quite know what's going on until it's too late.Then there is the Tango, a marvelously dark rendition of Roxanne. The dance on the ground floor plays out what is happening upstairs, and although we only see tantalising flashes of Satine &amp; the Count, the dancers fill in all the details. This is presented at such a pace that it leaves the viewers almost as breathless as the dancers, which is not a reason to hate it, but the key to the emotional power of this movie.Moulin Rouge never pretends to be a faithful rendition of 19th century Paris. Rather it uses that which viewers of a century later might be familiar with to convey the spirit of bohemian Montemartre.Moulin Rouge is not just a movie, it is an Experience. An Experience I doubt I'll ever forget. If there is a problem with this movie, it is that it makes me realise how empty other movies are - like realising that all those '5 star' ratings were actually out of 10, and I've now seen the real 10/10, and I now know what I've been missing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jumbled, overrated tale of a budding writer named Christian who leaves home and lives among "the children of the revolution", a diverse group of animated young romantics, in order to turn his literature into a successful career. In no time at all, Christian becomes involved in the performing arts at the seedy burlesque house/dance hall Moulin Rouge, and soon falls madly in love with the club's leading lady. The concept of a musical with an anachronistic soundtrack seemed interesting, but the choice of songs coupled with their unintentionally comic delivery completely ruined what might have been an otherwise effective movie. The editing was also tremendously disorganized, and as a result the film's mood seemed to constantly switch from surreal to real and back to surreal again. Lastly, this movie was far too long for its own good. Its style becomes overwhelmingly tiring long before the two hours are up. On the plus side, however, the set decoration and costumes were fantastic.</fullReview>

If you like any of the following then you'll love this movie: Comedy, Romance, Musicals, Ewan McGregor, or Nicole Kidman. After all this is "A story about love" The thing about this movie is that it's not just weak romance... it's REAL PASSION... And you can feel that when you watch this movie. There is this force between Ewan and Nicole in this movie and the love in the script actually comes onto the screen and you can actually FEEL the passion they're feeling when you watch it. It's amazing! It's not some sappy romantic movie- it's a story of true love.. A love that will last forever... 10/10...</fullReview>

I don't normally care for musicals. People bursting in to song usually seem rather out of place. In Moulin Rouge, the surreal nature of the whole movie is maintained and the singing seems not only natural, but essential. The integration of song and dialog is brilliant, often with no obvious border.The cinematography is superb, with some sweeping zoom &amp; pan from one shot to another supporting the surreal fantasy feeling.There is some similar tongue-in-cheek style to Strictly Ballroom (also from Baz Luhrmann)In my opinion there is no question this is the best movie ever made.

		<fullReview>All movies have a message right? At least, they are supposed to. If one came and asked you what the message from Moulin Rouge was, you would know even if you hated the film. It was typed out for you right at the beginning. Ever seen a movie do that?The Moulin Rouge sets the stage for an immaculate story to take place, and also encompasses the history of France, and the Bohemian culture. Special effects aside, we can learn a lot from this film. Definitely, this film set the standard for musicals of the future. Although I can't imagine why anybody would resist its divine pull, if after the first half-hour you aren't hypnotized by the spectacle, go ahead and leave. You aren't ready to see it yet.Baz Luhrmann's fall-out-of-your-seat wonderful film takes apart the French Can-Can movies of the '50s and reimagines them for a new century. With jaw-dropping set designs, computer legerdemain and a soaring soundtrack of orchestrally reconfigured pop standards, the film brilliantly bridges a hundred years of cabaret, vaudeville, India's "Bollywood" extravaganzas and MTV. Who would imagine that a movie with such a rich story and no explosions or cars could have super-charged effects. Mr. Luhrmann wouldn't settle for less.Truly, Baz Luhrmann is a genious, and that is why i made my name- just for this review. And all you who think this movie is a waste of time: I'm sorry you don't appreciate art, and know that you should broaden your horizons before slamming something you don't understand. The movie wasn't written for you anyway. It was written for those who DO believe in true love.-Mark-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i think moulin rouge was a real break through film,perhaps ahead of it's time. i'm surprised it isn't a huge hit. although in an age of middle of the road hollywood films, where car chase scenes, and gore rule, it could be just to original, and artsy for most folks. at first i thought i would be annoyed by the cover songs, but much to my surprise, i found them very well done. visually this movie is incredible. i loved the cast, especially nicole kidman, she looked like old hollywood star's did. i was delighted by her comedy sexual antics. great spoofy edge to the whole film. it was a bit like gilbert and sullivan meets busby berkley on acid. i felt like i had been there for the summer of love. a must for anyone who likes theater, or musicals, incredible sets, great dancing, the costumes were oscar worthy as was the set design. if i had trouble with any part of it, perhaps the editing required a seat belt. i loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>before this, i hated 'your song'...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ok, so i have now seen this movie 4 times. i have made others see it with me. i have the soundtrack. but there is not a single song in that movie (of the covers, that is) that i liked, or even tolerated, before i saw the movie. but now, when i listen to the soundtrack, i feel the way i usually feel when i listen to the smiths. but enough about the music...i am not quite sure what has drawn me to this movie. the first time i saw it, about 2 weeks after it opened, the theater was packed for the matinee. the audience was 'into' this movie, which perhaps enhanced my view of it. people laughed, people cried, everyone stayed till the end of the credits (!). the males in the audience were crying! i was crying! it was an audience love-in. the second time i saw it a few days later, it was again packed. people walking in were singing 'because we can can can'. there was a grandmother with her grandson. they both left crying. as did i. by the third and fourth times i saw it, i was bawling openly for the last 20 minutes. i can imagine that those who are not used to the lightning-fast style of mtv would get a little disturbed by the editing style, but i found that it really enhanced the whirlwind feeling of suddenly being dropped into the moulin rouge. people who know me cannot believe that i would be so attracted to a movie about a love story. the last movie i saw this many times was fight club. i think this movie appeals to a very broad audience: those who appreciate the absurd, those who watch mtv, those who like musicals, those who like tragic love stories, those who have always wanted to see ewan mcgregor not looking emaciated...to all filmmakers: more musicals please!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the past few years it had started to seem that Hollywood was never going to do anything different or special. For years it was the trend movies (ie-the disaster movies, WW2 movies, destroying earth movies). Now we have this glimmering light from the depths of Hollywood shining through all the proverbial muck. I can't say much more about this movie without talking about the story and plot. But I can say that I was making plans to see it again less than half way through the movie. And it doesn't hurt that the music is wonderful. McGregor and Kidman are incredible together, and they have the most wonderful voices. I recommend this movie to any person of any age, and especially to those of a theatre background.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the short time since this movie opened, it has become one of my all time favorite films ever. Moulin Rouge is fast, furious, and gorgeous. It will take you from extreme comedy to extreme tragedy and all points in between. Not one member of the cast is lacking. Ewan McGregor is incredible as an actor and a singer. The same is to be said of Nicole Kidman. Jim Broadbent and John Leguizamo also give standout performances. The music is familiar, brand-new and completely brilliant all at the same time. It is said of this movie that you will either love it or hate it. And I agree with that. But I think most people that gave it a real chance loved it. It's an unforgettable movie experience. Vive Le Moulin Rouge!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so the plot could have been a little stronger. But in light of everything else that was good about this movie, the plot seems kind of irrelevant, don't you think?The really beautiful thing about Moulin Rouge is that it comes across as less of a movie and more of a very elaborate stage show. The visuals and the music were what really made it great, especially the vibrant use of color and the hilarious popular music parodies (including Madonna's "Like a Virgin" among others). The deliberately over-the-top performances added to the effect.The beginning of this movie is incredibly corny, I'll admit, but not by accident. Instead, it *revels* in its corniness, and that makes it excusable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my new favorite movie. I loved it. My cousins had told me they had loved it. So they invited me to see it with them. It was probably the best movie I had ever seen. I thought I had loved movies before. But they all look like garbage now that I have seen this. The only thing that comes even close to this is Disney's "The Lion King", which is nothing like Moulin Rouge, but is the closest I can think of to pure excellence other than MR.Even though I had seen the plot a million times before, it was special this time. The costumes, cinematography, coloring, etc. were all great. But nothing could compare to the singing. Nicole Kidman was terrific. But Ewan McGregor was exceptional. His voice had just melted in my heart. His voice itself actually made me cry(and I rarely cry), not just the movie(which is sad). I loved the way they would use modern songs. They fit so well. I especially loved "Like A Virgin", which was very funny.So overall, this is an excellent movie. *10 out of 10*!!!!! See it!!! Many, many times!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film has run away with my heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite what people have said about this movie, I am going to be steadfast and say that I LOVED this movie!. The shrill camp keeps the plot amusing while the drama keeps it interesting by giving the movie chops. This "rhapsodic celebration of a cliche" is absolutely wonderful and as a future music major, I thought that Nicole Kidman's and Ewan McGregor's singing was exceptional for the role. (Kudos to the two of them for toughing it out and learning how to carry a tune along with my heart). The characters Satine and Christian portrayed by Ms. Kidman and Mr. McGregor were extraordinary works that made me feel what they felt(In my opinion, all characters in all movies should do this). The slap-stick "drama" of the Bohos, the gregariousness of Harold Zidler, and the sniveling wickedness of the Duke only add to the texture of the film. I encourage anyone with a song in their heart to see this movie, and to buy the soundtrack right afterwards. Suggestion to Baz Luhrmann: Make a second cd with all of the orchestral accompaniment and other left out misc. music on it. I'm sure everyone wants a copy of Zidler's and the Duke's rendition of "Like a Virgin"!All in all, this movie is on my personal top ten list as it should be on anyone else's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To begin, I had anticipated failure regarding "Moulin Rouge" before I knew the first thing about it. Then, to completely transform my opinion of the film, a relative of mine went to see it, and returned with the surprising news that it was the greatest movie he'd seen all year, and he's no novice when it comes to the film industry. He raved about it, to say the least, and said that it was most certainly Best Picture material; he gave it a definite 10 out of 10. I was shocked, but then again my brother has always had an interesting view on movies. So I figured WHAT THE HECK and decided to make the trek over to the movie theater and give it a shot. I was astonished at what this unusual movie had to offer in multiple forms; pure entertainment, artistic ability, impeccably remarkable acting, etc. Beyond these, the story accompanying "Moulin Rouge" was intense, and did not cease to keep me at my most interested and amazed. From the romance to the music to the keys on Christian's typewriter clicking, this was definitely one of those unforgettable movies that I've rarely has the pleasure of seeing these days. That's not to say that "Moulin Rouge" is old-fashioned. On the contrary. It is a delightful mix of both the old and the new.I personally give "Moulin Rouge" 9 out of 10, and encourage all who read this to go see it. But do not delay, for it frankly will be worthless, pathetic and most likely a waste of time to view on video; you absolutely MUST see it in the theater. All things considered, a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to watch all the entertaining elements in one movie you should watch Moulin Rouge. MR is a dazzling picture which offers whatever you desire. Enchanting girls, colours, movements, energy, love story , music and so on. I describe the movie as: Enchants the eyes. But, some scenes seem to be week written. Sometimes their love is a little bit ridiculous. An amazing thing about this film is the music. It successfully presents a mixture of today Pop and Rock music which makes Moulin Rouge a distinguished movie. The story takes place in the early 20th century, and it was wonderful to hear The Sound of Music song a this time, when it hadn't been released yet. Nicole Kidman has a natural talent to perform sexy and erotic roles. She is magnificent in this movie and a good choice for this character. I just can't understand why Tom Cruise broke up with such a lady.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge, was, as mentioned in one of the other comments, the foundation of story's, plots, and themes today. 'Love' being the entire theme of the film, to call the film 'A new Idea' you would definatley have to go back in time, to before the world...With that in mind, it was the most enjoyable and fantastically, well-put film I've seen in an extremely long time (Never!!!)...The extremely simple theme of love, gave Luhrman the ability to play, match, and create a fantastical story of - guess - LOVE, but not only this. Early in the film, the statement "This is a story about Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all LOVE." The love, passion, anxiety, jealousy, and finally truth in the film was put wonderfully into a fast moving, high pitched, musical!!!The soundtrack... What can I say???... Superb!!!... The use of old time songs, both in the film, and the soundtrack, was 'mastermind'!!! Generally, with a musical or slightly musical theme, the soundtrack doesn't reflect the movie what-so-ever... This sountrack, brings the story right into the music. Each song is a reflection of a scene, or theme in the film and therefore, cannot be compared with any other...After the huge fuss of movies like 'Titanic', Moulin Rouge is absolutely under-estimated. The critics were hard on the film, due to Kidman's recent break-up, and the pressure put on her to perform brilliantly. Thankfully!,those who did go and see it are always happily surprised...BUT! - a large amount of people have found that you have to see the movie at least twice, due to the flash-backs, and fast-moving plot, and for those less used to it, or those who don't really fancy it, the second time is vital...You cannot comment on the Moulin Rouge without having seen it twice - unless you are used to fast moving plots and can easily understand them...Without seeing this movie, I don't think anyone can be allowed to have a 'favourite movie'...This is DEFINATELY the best movie in the world... See it, or be deprived...Enjoy... from ash...10/10!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is to 2001 what Gone With the Wind was to 1939. It is beautiful, original, thought-provoking, and incredible. Baz Luhrmann proves his genius for writing and directing through this work of cinematic excellence. The wondrous combination of music with artwork with acting with camera drove me to laughter, tears, and goosebumps, all at just the right moments. The film achieved at every turn the director's dream of transmitting an emotion from a screen and speakers to the very soul of an audience. McGregor, Kidman, Broadbent, Roxburg, and Leguizamo meshed in a harmony not seen by me since Hunt and Nicholson in As Good as it Gets. The characters, the actors, and the acting style fit together perfectly to produce a beautiful film about love, life, and loss. Never before has a film enthralled me to such an extreme. Not only a must-see, but a must-see-again-and-again-and-again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A first-rate movie musical, after all this time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this is a movie musical. So if you really don't like musicals, this movie may not be for you.That said, I love musicals, and once I realized that direction in the movie (I did not know it was a musical beforehand), I settled into musical mode and continued. The fact that this is a musical also explains many critics' disdain for the seemingly cloying and simplistic plot. Musicals are not generally known for their complex intellectual themes. They're not supposed to be. Musicals are supposed to evoke more of an emotional response, and in my opinion, this one does an outstanding job. The bohemian theme of love above all else...what more could you ask for in a depiction of turn of the century Montmartre in Paris? I kept expecting Edith Piaf's voice to come through, wrenching my heart right out.Moulin Rouge is fast-paced, with a continual barrage of sensory stimuli. I know that is a sore point for many critics. I love it. It gives me that much more reason to see it again, to see what I've missed. And there is indeed so much to see. The cinematography is amazing! The costumes are not far behind. But above all else, on an emotional level, this musical delivers. There are only a few moments in the entire movie that I think are a bit overdone. But they are gone in a flash, replaced with suspense, humor, or any number of whirlwind emotions as the cast jumps into another performance.My advice is if you see this movie, go in with an open mind. Prepare for elaborate musical productions. Prepare to be sensorially assaulted. Let la vie boh?me wash over you. And I don't think you'll be disappointed. 8 out of 10 stars from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Avant, Not Enough Garde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not the target audience for this movie. I'm not even anywhere downrange. I think I realized this when Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sang a duet that incorporated a gamut of musical soundbites from Elton John to Whitney Houston, without once touching on a song that I don't personally loathe. The rather odd and jokey placement of modern catchphrases and lyrics in 1900 Paris was actually not as annoying as I had feared; it was often fun to try and catch all the references. But eventually, it degenerated into a tired gimmick. And if "Your Song" ever comes on my car radio again, I'll have to change the station quick or swerve into a tree or something.The anachronistic song placement is minor compared to the other sins of "Moulin Rouge", which is basically just a Concept masquerading as a movie. There's the story to consider, which seems as if Baz Luhrmann and his accomplice screenwriter just took every cliche they could find (plus a "Smooth 70's" compilation CD) and put them in a blender set on "frappe", then threw the mixture against the wall, in the vain hope that something might stick. It would have been helpful to have some kind of meta-subtitles to help us through the story (ATTENTION: For the next few minutes, this film will be channelling "Camille". Please stand by.) When the story hits a standstill, the movie just repeats its mantras (some yada-yada about Truth and Beauty, and Learning to Love and Be Loved, or something like that) as a way to jump-start the narrative and wake the audience.Luhrmann's directing style is non-stop frenetic and exhausting, with all the subtlety and nuance of a stainless steel rolling pin. It doesn't work with this material. He did the same thing with "Romeo + Juliet", but at least there he had a better screenwriter. The showy visuals and strange angles don't so much inform the story as try to distract you from it. The Concept is everything here, and it rules "Moulin Rouge" with an iron fist. When a few of the scenes actually threaten to develop cinematic merit on some level, the Concept quickly batters them into submission, and the result is an unholy mess. If incoherence were bullets, this would be a John Woo movie.The acting is terrible as well. The two leads manage relatively well (Kidman's version of "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend" won't make anyone forget Monroe, but it's a treat anyhow), but the rest of the cast is content to chew the scenery, spit it up, and chew it some more. John Leguizamo is a particular disappointment. The man has talent, and when he's on, he's the smartass Peter Lorre of his generation. When he's not, he just yells a lot. Some actors have made a career out of being the best thing in bad movies; Leguizamo seems content to go down with the ship.You can practically see the sweat stains on this movie as Luhrmann strives to pack as much crap onscreen as possible. The last time anyone was trying this hard in a movie, it was Jude Law crossing the Volga over the objections of homicidal Stukas in "Enemy at the Gates". When it comes to pitiless annihilation, Stukas ain't got nothing on Art.Ah, well, we'll always have Paris.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>here it is... you ready for it?This will be the best movie of the year. I'm making that statement now and unless something truly amazing comes out, this is the winner. It is an innovative movie and deserves a place in history. Never before, not in the days of Ken Russell or even Stanley Kubrik has a movie been so geared to evoke emotions from an audience. Every frame, every jump-cut, every look, note, word, and movement has intention purpose and it all succeeds gorgeously. Luhrman makes wonderful use of cultural standard songs from the ye old "Diamonds are a girl's best friend" and "Sound of Music" to classics like "all you need is love" and "Lady Marmalade" to the new songs like "Smells like Teen Spirit". The plot is borrowed (La Traviata), as are the ideals (La Boheme, or Rent if you must), the drum beats synthesized, the whole movie is built on the talent of past creative minds. This movie should seem false, all glitz and glamour but no substance, but that is not so. The material is arranged so beautifully and carried out with a marvelous abandon by all the creative minds. The words are so corny, the acting so over the top, the music so familiar and "traditional", but at no time does it ever pretend. It never makes you forget that you are in a theatre watching a movie, yet it sweeps you off your feet like no other movie in the history of movies. Not Braveheart, nor Lawrence of Arabia, nor Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, (certainly not Titanic or Shakespeare in Love) have the romantic sweep of this movie. It overwhelms you with it's reckless romanticism that one can't help but be swept up and away, riding Luhrman's wave until the final frame. I don't care if this movie wins Oscars, frankly no movie that deserves the oscars gets them (Quills, State and Main, High Fidelity, Magnolia) and even if they do, they don't get enough (American Beauty deserved at least 8, so did Crouching Tiger) but at this juncture, I hope that it at least is nominated for Best picture, actor, actress, supporting actor (for Broadbent mostly, but Leguizamo, Roxburgh, and Jacek Koman all deserve recognition), director, editing, cinematography, art direction, costumes, original song, and perhaps (if there was enough original material) score. Get it right this time Academy!!!!! recognize landmark filmmaking!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie more and more. I am beginning to appreciate that Nicole Kidman did her own singing. Audrey Hepburn didn't do it in "My Fair Lady," Leslie Caron didn't do it in "Gigi" or Natalie Wood in "Westside Story." I can't wait for the DVD to come out. I want to see if they show anything that was cut, there's a very small part of the story that seems unexplained and really doesn't effect the outcome but I have a feeling there might have been a scene that ties it together. This is destined to be a classic and I the live version on stage should be amazing. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! I'm in love with this movie. I rarely, if ever, return to the theater to see a movie for a second time. The last time I did this I was about 10 years old and my mother gave me hell when I got home. In the last 3 weeks, I've seen Moulin Rouge 3 times, and I still haven't tired of it.This movie gives and gives and gives, never holding back. The combination of the beautiful sets, the story, the love songs, and the bold, bold courageous way in which all of it was done all combine to make a great movie, not just Oscar worthy, but a classic that may last years. The set design is lush, full of brilliant eye popping colors and gorgeous sets depicting turn of 20th century Paris and the dark "underworld" of the Moulin Rouge theater. Particularly, I loved the set in the Satine's bedroom, the vivid red and blue colors, hearts within hearts, and, of course, the elephant building where she lived.I'm not a lover of pop music, but I loved the way all of the music was used to tell the story of Satine, the courtesan, and Christian, the poet. Almost every time a song was introduced, the audience would titter as people recognized the most popular songs of the 70's 80's and 90's--which may or may not have been the movie's intent. Nevertheless, each time this happened, I felt a playfulness here that eventually resolved itself into something deeper and more profound. It was as if the movie was saying go ahead, let's have some fun here, but we're going to take you further than you originally expected, and I believe that Moulin Rouge did this from the very start, crescendoing to the very end, taking us deeper and deeper. Take for instance, when the song Touched Like a Virgin starts, we can't think of anything but Madonna, but upon further reflection, this song speaks so truthfully of Satine who's heart is opened for the very first time to the possibilities of love with a poor poet. In this new context we find how well this song speaks to our feelings of open heartedness (virginity of the heart) when we are in love.Lastly, I was very taken with the story of the poet's love for the beautiful courtesan and her inner struggle between her love for him and her lust for wealth and fame. The theme of love--the most important thing to know is to love and to know that you are loved in return--that love is at the core of our very humanity--that in spite of egoistic distractions, love is how we truly find ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Theatre at the cinema!! "spectacular spectacular"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film I've been waiting all year to see and I wasn't disappointed. The visuals are just amazing. The emotional impact of music and song in a film has been missing for so long it's great to have it back with this amazing treat. The acting was great (though a little corny at times), the set designs left my jaw gaping open and the songs were 'spectacular spectacular', the modern twist made you want to sing along as you watched. Well done to Ewan and Nicole who can both sing brilliantly!!This is arty blockbuster at it's best and a film you can see again and again just due to the pace and beauty of the production, pure theatre on the cinema screen. I've been waiting for a long time to see a love story where there's actual chemistry between the leads, the emotion seemed throughly believable. I laughed, I cried and I wanted to see it again once it finished. A cult classic in the making!!Thank you Baz Luhrmann for giving me a throughly enjoyable evening, Please make more films like this!! The musical is back with a bang (and feathers)!!***** out of ***** I'd give this film more if I could!!! this is definatly in my top 10 favorite films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a time when movies are produced sheerly to make a buck on whatever the "hippest" and most contemporary fad is in effect, Moulin Rouge stands out.Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman deliver stand-out performances--as do John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent, Richard Roxburgh and well... the whole damn cast was great, really.The story may not be the most original, but the style and deliverance of it is very much so.Baz Luhrmann deserves a great deal of praise for this flawless, beautiful film. A little wild, weird and "out there," but that's what movies are supposed to be, right?Go see the latest Titanic incarnation if it suits you (ahem, Pearl Harbor) or the latest Indiana Jones rip-offs if that's your thing (Mummy Returns and Tomb Raider) or maybe even the new, modernized version of E.T. (A.I.), but for those with a genuine appreciation for film... Check out Moulin Rouge. It is: "Spectacular, Spectacular!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film several times since it's opening, and, if finances and time allowed, would see it several more. It's an amazing look at the beauty, freedom, truth, and, above all things, love, as the advertisements describe it. Nicole and Ewan give their masterpiece performances here, being a triple threat, and it's a vehicle that showcases both talents' more than their past projects. I wasn't a particular fan of the director until I saw this one, but will now follow his career. I know this isn't exactly a review, just some gushing at a film I'm in awe of.

		<shortDescription>Insanely beautiful modern opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge tells the story of Christian (McGregor), an innocent young poet who defies his father and moves to late nineteenth century Paris to live a penniless bohemian life, and winds up falling in love with Satine (Kidman), the "Sparkling Diamond" of the Moulin Rouge, a nightclub. Satine, who is dying of tuberculosis but doesn't know it, dives into an ill-fated relationship with Christian, despite the only rule of the Moulin Rouge: never to fall in love. The storyline is cliche, but it is told in such a unique way that you feel as if you're being told a love story for the very first time.Everything about this film is beautiful. The visuals are even more outlandish and artistic than those of Baz Luhrmann's last film, William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, but they seem to work even better for this film. The scenes cut so often and are so mixed up that the movie could have easily been a mess, but Luhrmann somehow managed to put them all together perfectly.The music is also wonderful. I have always had a soft spot for film musicals, and it's refreshing to know that they haven't gone completely extinct. The music is also fun because it's mostly made up of contemporary pop songs, featuring such artists as Sting and Elton John, as well as a few classics like "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend" and "The Sound of Music." It's amazing how well the songs fit; it almost seems as if they were written for the movie.The acting is astounding. Nicole Kidman is wonderful, and has a surprisingly good voice (yes, it is her singing). And Ewan McGregor is indescribably amazing! He is immensely talented as an actor and has a beautiful voice. He really has a talent for making the audience feel the intense emotions that pour out of his character. Richard Roxburgh, Jim Broadbent and John Leguizamo, who play the Duke, Zidler, and Toulouse Lautrec respectively are all very entertaining, providing the comic relief. All of the actors portray their characters in a very exaggerated, melodramatic and operatic way, which confirms the fact that this film is a modern opera.This movie swept me off my feet. Everything about it is perfect; I wouldn't change a thing. When it came to the end of the movie, it felt to me like waking up from a wonderful dream, wishing it could have lasted forever. But it is obviously the type of movie where you either love it or you hate it, because it's so unique. If you tend to go for simple movies, or movies with a diverse, constantly twisting plot (not that I don't love that genre), you probably won't see much in this movie. But if you like original, artistic, intensely dramatic films, this is one you don't want to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is a great film, and one of the best this year. It's clashes everything great together and makes an amazing and NEW film. Moulin Rouge is an OPERA, a MUSICAL, a COMEDY, a DRAMA, oh let the list roll on and on and on. Moulin Rouge, it is my guess, will destroy the almost perfect Rocky Horror Picture Show, and bring something new to the midnight people. If not, oh well. If this movie doesn't get noticed for some award somewhere than there is no hope for mankind. I hate calling this a "movie", I think it's a film, because a film means something and isn't just slapped together in one night. This is ART, this is everything ART should be. My mind is so full of greatness from this film I'm having a very hard time writing about it.SEE THIS MOVIE, THEN SEE IT AGAIN (because you'll want to), then write to God or whatever corp. is owning the theater, and beg them to make something like this every year.

If my guesses are right it SHOULD come out of next year with a swag of Oscars, and just as many nominations.I think John Liguizeamo (sp?) as Toulouse, Jim Broadbent as Zidler and Richard Roxybourgh (sp?) as The Duke, will all come out with an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and the winner will probably be Toulouse.The score will win. The camera and editing should win. And it SHOULD get Best Picture, making it the first musical to win the award since God Know's When.

My wife insisted and alas I gave in. Maybe only to keep her quiet.2 Hours 20 minutes Later......Moulin Rouge is an exquisite, tearjerking, mayhem filled Extravaganza. Quite Possibly the best film I have ever seen. I was so glad my wife forced me into that theater, and I pity anyone who doesn't see it in a split minute.Albeit the love story within the love story has been DONE to death but who cares. This is certainly the most original film I have had the pleasure of viewing in a long while. The Performances were top notch besides Nicole Kidman who seemed to be in a daze for most of the film, But Ewan McGregor knocks your socks right off!!! He has a voice that could melt butter and his acting is top notch.I recommend this film to anyone and everyone.Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all else, Love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the category of ?how about that' : the most technically advanced film in some time is set in 1899. Baz Luhrmann's purpose is to capture the energy and spirit of that time period, portraying the Moulin Rouge as the Ultimate Party of that or any day. The belief is that back then people were less inhibited, less guarded than now. A slight disappointment is that there is only one scene showing the club in all its wanton glory. Shortly after, it's converted into a theater for the "Spectacular Spectacular." The first club scene is milked for all it's worth, though. This is electric, eye-popping cinema that really pulls you into the story. It would have been tough to top.The story isn't the most imaginative ever, but sticks to the format of the musical romance out of necessity. The film works so well because the story is so simple. Anything more complex would be lost in the kinetic pace of the visuals. "Moulin Rouge" is really like a roller coaster: one second you're moving slow and easy, the next you're blasted forward a hundred miles an hour. Even if another director could have thought up some of the visual ideas Luhrmann comes up with, they'd likely dismiss them as impossible to pull off. The film is like nothing you've ever seen before and yet, oddly familiar at the same time. Luhrmann seems determined to give you something cool to look at every second. You're literally afraid to blink for fear of missing the slightest thing. The ?super zoom' is a marvel to watch, the shot that starts miles away from its target, then pulls you forward at light speed until you're right on top of it. But this isn't all just computer wizardry. It's how the director, for instance, will use two different color filters in one shot, or adds energy to a scene by editing together shots filmed at different speeds. Astonishing. I'm an Oscar junkie so I'm always looking out for films that will tempt the almighty Academy. Certainly the best film of the year so far, I could see "Moulin Rouge" nearly running the table: Sound, visual effects, cinematography, editing, directing, original song for "Come What May," acting for Nicole Kidman, Jim Broadbent, John Leguizamo (who somehow plays a dwarf). An original score nomination would be a toughie, as Luhrmann pieces this one together from thirty or so classic songs from several genres, re-imagining them in the context of this story. I'll probably be proven wrong as the inevitable crop of quality movies enter the fold beginning in August. One thing is sure, though: "Moulin Rouge" will not be forgotten.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're a sucker for tragic romance, and music...you're in for a treat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is a great movie....for some people. It's one of those "love it, hate it" movies---I, personally, loved it. All of my friends loved it; in fact, everyone I know that's seen it has loved it, a lot of them have and seen it twice. Compare it with Baz Luhrman's "Romeo and Juliet" for the sweeping, tragic, romance. Compare it with an artsy music video for the cinematography. Then compare it with your Greatest Hits from the Last 30 Years CD for the soundtrack. It's about 1/2 opera, 1/2 dialogue. Imagine such songs as "Your Song", "Roxanne", and "Like A Virgin" as key scenes in the movie, only all songs tweaked to be "broadway"nized. Ewan McGregor's performance is quite good, and his voice proves to be pretty decent, too. (I enjoyed his rendition of Elton John's `Your Song' better than the original!) Nicole Kidman is in a typical `unattainable goddess' role, with pretty good acting (not as impressive as McGregor's emotional performance), and with an I-Got-the-Lead-in-a-few-High-School-Musicals voice. Be prepared to be open-minded for the first 20 minutes (it's a little weird in the beginning), but to be delighted with the rest of the film. And BE OPEN MINDED! You should love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of 2001's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a film that is not only visually appealing, but may bring back the musical genre. The interesting aspect of Moulin Rouge is that either, one does not like the film or one does. There seems to be very little middle ground. That ability to draw out emotion, to create talk days, weeks after the viewing is wonderful. Nobody will be talking about Tomb Raider three weeks from now, but Moulin Rouge, well, this baby has legs. Another interesting aspect of this film is that while other successful and entertaining films, Shrek for instance, was created to appeal to a wide audience, thereby not asking for the patrons to involve themselves with the story as it will be laid out for them, Moulin Rouge asks, no demands, that you get involved. If you fail to get involved then you will fail to understand the beauty of two people in love. That it is not all visual, but also psychological, tactile, and dare I even say olfactoral. Then again to understand the film, maybe Christen (McGregor)was right, you had to have been in love to understand love. And I do mean true love. Not the shallow kind of love many are in today. BTW I have nothing but admiration for the use of the songs portrayed. I love the idea that songs we all listened to, reflected on, and talked about as a culture was reflected in the story. I believe their use just allows us the ability to understand the story and charactors better. As Toulouse Lautrec once said (to paraphrase), I love the Moulin Rouge, because its ugliness is so beautiful. Check out his art as it brilliantly captures the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been one to go out of my way to see a musical. I was,in fact, dragged into it against my will. By the time I walked out I was convinced it was the choice of movies in the cinema at the time.Baz Luhrmann again creates another tragic love story, however, this time he makes no effort to use smoke and mirrors, plot twists, red herrings or particularly in-depth characters to make his point. In fact he emphasises the plainness of the plot with his 'play within a play' depicting the very going ons of the main characters. Most evident of all is his use of a classic genre whereby the opening scene sees one of the main characters, Christian, in complete despair at the loss of love. From here, he proceeds to enlighten us with how events led to this point in time.The genius of this movie lies with the musical ironies. Through the sensory overload of the can-can scene, upper-class men in tuxedoes revelling with 'working girls' in an orgy of gyrating, colour-filled dance, the glib, clichéd, contemporary love song medley, to Roxanne Tango and who will forget two sleazy men, singing and dancing around the Gothic-style apartment to 'Like a Virgin'. The musical score is clever, the mixes sensational and led by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in the lead roles, whose singing are very competent and adds to the depth and flavour of the movie.I must admit, at times the visual effects reminds me of one who has just received a video camera for Christmas and spends the length of the movie, trying out each visual effect option the machine provides - full colour, black and white, a range of cepeas - oldies but goodies. However, in saying so, the applied effect achieves its aim of emphasising the mood of the moment/scene.In all, I don't think there was one individual; original thought created during the entire movie and maybe this is the Baz's definative theme. However, the way it was put together, is no doubt unlike how anyone else would even have remotely conspired how this movie would ultimately turn out and it is a combination of this that stirs feelings of nostalgia and poignancy, while at the same time inspiring and funny.This is not a deeply moving movie, nor is it full of action and excitement. It is a still a highly entertaining and unique movie, one I expect to attain cult status in years to come. I thoroughly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't perfect, although few movies are. Many people think Baz Luhrman's work is too odd and out of the box to enjoy, but that's just because Romeo + Juliet was so horrible. Well, anything you held against Baz, forget about it. Moulin Rouge is an excellent movie. It is odd, and definately outside of the box, but it's the closest to perfect I've ever seen in a movie. The music is so wonderful, you can instantly tell what the characters are feeling because it's familiar music! Instead of writing a whole array of new songs, Baz just included the characters singing famous songs. That may sound cheesy, but it works amazingly well. Of all movies I've seen, none have portrayed true love this well. In our modern world of one-night stands and divorces, it'll seem corny, but if you watch with an open mind, you'll see how perfect love is embodied in Moulin Rouge (ironic, considering the movie is about a brothel turned theater). There's not much more I can say that hasn't been said already. Just make sure you see it, preferably in theaters.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since the opening of this movie, I've seen it four times. I own the soundtrack and an original movie poster. To say I like this movie is an understatement. I wanted to see it since I saw the trailer. But being as how movies have really sucked as of late, I had really no expectations except that it looked promising. This movie is more than promising. I'm not going to say it's the best movie ever made, but it's the most creative and beautiful movie I've seen in years. I realize that not everyone will like it. People have different opinions, but I thought it was great. I've never been a fan of Nicole Kidman, but she was absolutely fabulous in this movie. I don't care what anyone says about her performance, because it was OUTSTANDING. As an actress I know how hard emotional scenes are and she handled them with grace and made it seem that she wasn't acting at all. Ewan McGregor also did a commendable job. Both actors have singing voices that could soothe you to sleep. True, the songs weren't original, but as one critic said, it seems the songs were written just for this movie. Every familiar song you hear, every lyric, seems to go right with the storyline.This is a great movie. Not for everyone, but definately for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dazzling melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film sets your head spinning with its noisy opening, its brilliant colours which burst like rockets on to the screen and the masterful camera work which lifts you up over the roof tops of Paris and propels you through the doors of the celebrated Moulin Rouge. It is like nothing you have seen before. A truly new cinematic experience. Amongst all the fanciful Mont Martre characters - almost grotesque at times- runs a simple love story of Satine, the top star of the Moulin Rouge who is torn between wealth and security offered by a duke and the promise of love by a penniless writer of poetry. What surprises me most is the comedy. Somehow I did not expect it. An hilarious scene (there were many) was the secret meeting of Satine, the prostitute (Nicole Kidman) with Christian the poet (Ewan McGregor). She thought he wanted sex when he was simply determined to read her one of his poems. The clever mingling of well-known songs (quite out of the period of 1900) linked the scenes with amazing effect. At one moment it was the Sound of Music, at another a suggestion of Gilbert and Sullivan- a mad mixture of songs, but it worked and oh so well. I found myself enjoying every moment of this intricate weaving of songs. This film has all the elements of a great production. It will never cease to amaze me how Baz Lurhmann could assemble such a wild lot of characters and bring them together in such a frenzy of sheer entertainment. By the way, don't forget to take your handkerchief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are as many bad reviews as here are good ones out there for Moulin Rouge, so I had to see it for myself. The previews showed a lot of glitz and a lot of glamour, but no real substance to the plot or characters, so that's pretty much what I expected; a good looking film and not much more. I'm glad to say I was mistaken. Of course, the film is visually dazzling, not just from the sets and costumes but from Baz's nifty trademark directing also. Nicole Kidman, (whom I never really used to like very much) was outstanding, beautiful and in every way stunning, as was Ewan McGreggor, in this gorgeous fairy tale Romantic romance. A story about 'Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all Love', Moulin Rouge is, in a word, SPECTACULAR!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual feast for the eyes, lavishly produced - but ultimately vapid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A respected movie critic has described this movie as being "spectacularly bad" - and he is being forgiving here.Part of the film's fatal weakness is that it has no recognisable structure. It's part: comedic; musically camp, a la The Rocky horror Picture Show; love story with the requisite tedious pathos; intrigue and the stereotypical arch villain. In short, the film attempts to encompass everything to satisfy all tastes but becomes a shallow and unfulfilling composite of all the above genre, ultimately succeeding in neither. It is a huge visual extravaganza, though simultaneously it's also an overwhelming assault on the senses, because the whole thing is so over-produced. It overpowers you with the singing, dancing (albeit, skilfully choreographed) and lavish sets; that all the other elements in the film - especially the nuances in the love-mix - degenerate in becoming mere fillers for the next song-and-dance routine.For sure, Nicole Kidman, has an almost transcendent ethereal beauty about her - assisted with her on-screen makeup - but she doesn't convey much with her expressions and inchoate eyes - they seem vacant - to evoke any real compassion and affection from the audience. Finally, as for the death scene: if you weren't cringing, you would have to be quietly groaning and squirming in your seat - there wasn't a wet eye in the theatre and it was excrutiating to watch. As far as this viewer was concerned, it had all the emotional resonance of watching the coyote go over the cliff whilst watching a Roadrunner cartoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outrageous, garish, bombastic, and redeeming movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm coming down from a two-week period of obsession with this movie that included four viewings (two at the first sitting), not counting one viewing by my wife, three copies of the CD (one from my 10 year-old son for father's day), the hardcover picture book ($35 at Barnes and Noble), and countless discussions with friends, family, and co-workers, proselytizing for the movie. What can I say? I love it. Or to put it better, I love this movie and what it tries to do. It succeeds at much of it (enough of it?), and as for the rest, well, as they say, it's the thought that counts. I have found one central flaw in the film, which is that what is termed "love" and indeed feels like love in this story is actually "love at first sight" which I would say is not true, mature, real love like the love that married couples share over the daily grind of life for decades and decades. Satine "lies" to Zidler that her love for Christian is just "a little infatuation", without realizing that that's what it probably is. However, circumstances don't give these lovers a chance to grow into the real thing, and so they have to settle for what they get. Come to think of it, Romeo and Juliet had the same problem. Despite this flaw, it was not hard for me to do what Baz Luhrmann said in his book and suspend disbelief and skepticism, and go with the flow. Nicole and Ewan I found to be hugely likeable, and the chemistry between them was great. The movie was full to overflowing with characters, events, and sheer life! As a big fan of Strictly Ballroom, I was not completely taken by surprise, but it seemed to be the next step in the evolution of Luhrmann, and the entire production company seemed to take the leap with him. This was a very coherent performance; you could see on the face of every extra that they were completely into it. When I heard the children's choir behind Ewan in Your Song, I was touched, but later had the thought that this could have easily (and conveniently) been computer-synthesized. In the book there was a photo of the production of that song; there was the choir, and it was real, as was the entire show. I must agree with the review by moonlight reflections-- as kitschy as it seemed, there was something very honest about this film. It was honestly trying to tell us about truth, beauty, freedom, and love, for our own betterment. It was an act of emotional generosity by someone bursting with the message. To cite one particular scene, the first time I saw it (it seems a long time ago), after the Tango de Roxanne, I said out loud in the theater, "this man is a genius". I hold to that statement. I have several favorite directors, and I can't think of one who could have pulled off this powerful, riveting, upsetting scene. This was not the only moment of genius in this film. If you haven't seen it, see it. If you have seen it, see it again. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have only seen Moulin Rouge five times so far, but I love it. I don't understand how anyone could not love it. The colors, dancing, and music are nearly overwhelming. The romance from many viewpoints is completely enjoyable. The ability of the director to bring the viewer's mind into a certain frame through the use of music that brings the viewer back to times and experiences in their own life, many times matching the storyline, is remarkable. We thoroughly enjoy this movie and plan to keep going to see and and absolutely buy it when it comes out. But, see it in the theatre, especially one with the best sound you can get. I have been so won over to Nicole Kidman by this movie. And Ewan McGregor obviously enjoys acting so much that you just want to keep watching him. The part of Toulouse was played exceedlingly well, and I feel that the scene where Toulouse speaks to Christian when Christian is lying in bed, should win an Oscar all by itself!</fullReview>

Much like ,"Dancer in the Dark," I will definately be buying this when it comes out on DVD as I have to own this masterpiece!! The use of modern songs in the old setting of 1899 Paris oddly worked for me. I was thrown off at first when McGregor started singing, "The hills are alive with the sound of Music," but then I got interested. By the time "Like a Virgin," hit I was amazed, that song alone makes me want to go see the movie again. The last song in the movie is outright amazing!! Honestly I can't say enough about this movie! I want it to win awards just so more people will feel they have to go see it!</fullReview>

All my students will be writing essays about this film describing how early modern theatrical movements like Futurism, Dada, Symbolisme, Surrealism, Theatre of Cruelty, and Brecht are used and fused with 20th century popular culture enthythematic contructs to create a coherent and effective whole. I can't wait! Although, I'm sure they will groan. Too bad.I've seen it twice now and I found it even more thrilling the second time around. The only thing I HATE is that the "soundtrack" is NOT a soundtrack at all. Many songs are missing or in totally different forms than they are in the film. Small background pieces are brought to the forefront and central pieces are left out altogether.

		<shortDescription>A HOLLYWOOD ALLEGORY!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not about Moulin Rouge. Or even love at all. This is the director venting frustration against Hollywood.Ewan's character is repeatedly told to avoid Montramarte(I know that's wrongly spelled-sue me) because it is a place of sin-something we hear about HOLLYWOOD oh so often.In a distance the words 'Moulin Rouge' glow like the Hollywood sign, promising a glamorous underworld of illicit pleasures.He's repeatedly told by his father that he'll never make it, a sentiment that I, as young author am quite familiar with.And the part where they tell the idiotic, supercillious Duke(read:Studio head) about the story, looks like it could be the world's flashiest Studio pitch. Its no surprise that he decides to change the ending of the play Ewan has written, destroying the writer's artistic vision, for personal reasons totally unconnected to the work itself.The part of perpetual liar Harry, Moulin Rouge's 'ringleader', resembles a director kissing up to save his hide. Always saving the star's butt, who's off doing something she shouldn't be, brilliantly covering so the business deal he stands to profit from is not endangered.The good guys and bad guys are clearly drawn with the studio head, sworn enemy of art and originality(the latter being Baz's forte), emerging as a throughly hissable character who's eventually deafeated and the 'underling' ,writer Ewan emerging a victor, more or less. Lest we not forget that writers bear the brunt of studio head's contempt more fiercely than any other person in the biz.Could this not be Baz and Craig Pierce's sly satire on the goings on behind the camera, and in Hollywood's broad rooms?Perhaps I'm reading too much into the movie. I know I did enjoy it very much, and I rushedout to buy the soundtrack immeadiatley afterward.If you liked this movie, you should try 'The Player', 'S.O.B.', and 'Willian Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet'.Kudos to Baz,Pierce, Kidman, McGregor and all of those who collaboratedon the making of Moulin Rouge.</fullReview>

People with their thumbs up have pretty much said what I wanted to say but I just wanted to chip in with a bit of "Moulin Rouge delivered everything it promised considering the cast and the director" to those who can't help but spoil all the fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie taught me many things including NEVER TRUST REVIEWS!!!! Most reviews of the Moulin Rouge said that Baz Luhrmann pushed this movie too much. I thought that it was perfect. This movie is high on color and high on energy. "You will leave the theater feeling exhausted" People magazine said. This is completely false. You will leave singing your favorite tunes of the movie hoping that one day you will be as much in love as Satine (Kidman) and Christian (McGregor). (Well, thats what I felt) This is a must-see for everyone!! This movie has it all: love, suspense, tragedy and above all MUSIC!!!! Go see Moulin Rouge for a spectacular movie experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is a step above the rest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The numerous references to Ewan McGregor's penis size (which you will agree with if you've seen Pillow Book)made me realize how self-conscious this film is. After realizing that I just loved it all the more. It is such a culture savy film and it really pushes in your face how insane mass media and pop culture is. It is a film for people who are influenced by pop culture (just about everyone). And also people who like to be entertained. Because the film does go over the top, it uses cliches to it's advantage. Unlike pearl harbor for instance in which each cliche was met with a groan and rolling of the eyes. Also after seeing Moulin Rouge everything else seems tired. It must have been quite a task to edit that baby though. And there is so much foreshadowing. The food even foreshadows events to come. It was sort of shakespeare in love meets rocky horror or something and then take on some more song within a play within a story within a movie. Which is great because it reinforces the whole theme of a moulin, its circular motion. My favorite thing is when a film synthesizes its visuals, plot, and sound into a perfect whole. Since 2001 I haven't seen it done but I think Moulin Rouge does a pretty darn good job. Plus I was taken by how well the musical aspect worked with the plot. Using already known songs really only strengthened their meaning because along with them came all of the things that those songs mean to each person individually. And it also seems that they used the songs in homage and to make a statement, not just to make a profit. So before you read critic reviews by people that probably didn't have the time to actually assimilate the visually complex film, give it a chance, pay attention and whether you love it or hate it, you can at least appreciate the brightness and unique vision that this film offers. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as I'm concerned, World War 3 may start over Moulin Rouge. The film is so unique and utterly daring that opinions are flying all over the spectrum. There are some who say it is the biggest mistake in film history, and others who say that it is one of the most unique and wonderful films ever to grace the silver screen (and then there are those who don't know what to make of it.)Well, since everyone seems to have an opinion, I'll put in mine: I loved it. I found to be unique and fascinating. Here are some things to expect:1. Kinetic energy!! Hold on to your hats, the beginning moves VERY fast, so keep up.2. Great acting from Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, and the colorful supporting cast.3. Music. What a big way for the musical to come back! The modern songs effortlessly flow through the film and enhance it.4. Color. Look for crisp, clear, overwhelming color.5. Fun, humor, and the experience. You don't watch Moulin Rouge, you experience. So have fun! Laugh out loud! And lastly, SEE IT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Moulin Rouge is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. It has everything that one could possibly want in a movie--action, romance, comedic interludes, and a wonderful soundtrack. One of the best things about this film how is it filmed. At times this can be over-powering but in a good way. Some scenes are choppy to add depth and to give the film something different from the main-stream to the film. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman each to a very good job with the songs in this film and I was surprised with how excellent they actually sounded. When Ewan first sings, "Your Song," it's unexpected how wonderful his voice is. This film is beautiful and everyone should give it a chance. Don't let the negative comments that I've heard be the deciding factor as to whether you should see this movie or not. Give it a chance and you'll be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw it last night and loved it. The chemistry between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman was great, and the story between their two characters was moving. I liked the balance between the drama of their story, the music, the crazy choreography, and the humor. Plus, very clever little touches that made me smile when I noticed them, but they didn't distract me from the main story. Great visuals, too. One of my favorite movies of all time.I think Baz Luhrmann is a very good, very brave and creative director. Moulin Rouge is a somewhat familiar story told in an original way. I walked away from the theater in a better mood than before I saw it, feeling fulfilled, I guess. In my opinion, this film is what filmmaking is all about!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elating and exasperating; a peculiar combination.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have always been movies that have spawned countless hours of debate and controversy, be it for their subject matter or presentation. "Moulin Rouge," like Baz Lhurmann's previous endeavor, "Romeo + Juliet," is the type of movie that is argued over because of its presentation. Unlike "Romeo + Juliet," however, "Moulin Rouge" is not the type of film that should have never come into existence. It's not without its fair share of problems, but unlike most other movies today, it displays heart and is not self-conscious enough to concern itself with what people think about it; it is what it is, and doesn't seem to be pretentious enough to laud its own sense of creativity.The story centers around Christian (Ewan McGregor), an aspiring writer who wishes to write about truth, beauty, freedom, and above all things, love. The only problem is that he's never been in love himself. As he realizes this while he's typing in a hotel room in Paris, a random chain of characters and events lead him to the helm of a stage musical called "Spectacular, Spectacular," whose script is to be presented to the resident courtesan and performer of the Moulin Rouge, Satine (played by Nicole Kidman with the calculating air of a businesswoman and the charming, seductive type of quality that makes it possible for a man to become completely infatuated with a woman upon first sight).The Moulin Rouge, despite its consistently packed house, is in financial shambles, so the owner introduces the Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh) to Satine in what in her business one would consider a formal meeting. After a somewhat coincidental rendezvous with the writer of the new musical, the Duke agrees to finance the club, the only condition being that he possess all the rights--business and personal--to Satine. Christian and Satine then fall in love and strive to keep the affair a secret, and the movie follows the established formula that leads to the Duke's discovery of the affair and the final winner-take-all confrontation.Narratively, the film fails in two aspects. From the very beginning, we're told that Satine died and Christian never got to follow the relationship through to its desired point; it renders the main conflict of the movie a little useless, though it strives to pull all the right strings in an effort to make the movie a poignant experience for the viewer. The second problem? In order to do this correctly, you'd have to make the viewer be able to relate to both of the lovers personally. Christian's nature is discussed just fine, but Satine is presented as nothing more than what her business requires her to be. We see her go through the motions, but by the end, we really don't care too much for her character; Christian is the one whom we pity, and that only makes the movie half the success that it could be in this aspect.In terms of presentation, the louder numbers tend to be a little distracting and offsetting in comparison to the rest of the movie. The opening scene gives the movie somewhat of a grim prospect, so it's a little surprising when Christian and Satine first burst into a full-out love song. It all quickly becomes second nature, though, and by the time that the characters burst out into songs from this point forward, just like in any good musical, it couldn't seem more natural. Most of the songs do an exceptionally good job of letting the viewer know what the characters are feeling, but they feel a little contrived. Case in point: Satine and Christian's revelation of their love for one another. A medley of all the possible songs you could hear in contemporary soft radio stations, it ought to tell us something about the society that we're living in. Either we're primarily concerned with making money at the expense of honesty, or we're incapable of truly describing how we innately feel, thus the quoting of every possible song in the world into a single number.Despite the blatant commercialization, though, the movie succeeds in a somewhat paradoxical sense: it feels very, -very- honest. How could this be? It's difficult to describe, but it appears as though this was Baz Luhrmann's primary intention, and somehow he managed to see it through to the end. Perhaps it was the sheer potency of certain numbers, like the tango-esque "Roxanne," which wove all the feelings of the movie into a tight little ball and had them explode in an aurally and visually overwhelming manner. If as much care had gone into the characterization, I'm certain that this would have received a lot more critical acclaim. As it is, you're possibly in for a bit of exasperation, elation, and the type of wonderment that's elicited when you see something completely, utterly new. In today's world, that's somewhat of a rare accomplishment; it's always better to savor it before it's emulated and commercialized, as ironic as it may sound.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Moulin Rouge" is not just a movie. It's a rollercoaster ride. And a thrilling one at that. Baz Luhrmann has created a truly unique movie experience- You may love it or hate it but I urge you to buy your ticket, strap yourself in and keep your arms wholly within the car because you're in for an exhilarating ride.Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor are just great, but it's the visuals that give this a whopping 9 stars. I haven't stopped thinking about this movie since I saw it (twice) 2 weeks ago. The one feature that has not been praised, to date, is the extraordinary original music written for the film. I hope that a second album is released that includes this, especially the end title music. Stunning!</fullReview>

One of those ideas was a concept of greatness, grandness, and showstopping excentric ideology. Moulin Rouge has updated this idea into the technology of the 21st century, without losing the meaning of the idea itself. Bravo, Bravi, Brave.

		<shortDescription>The eternal question, Style or substance?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My old film teacher would tell me that a simple story line is best when creating a film that is a masterpiece. There is no doubt in my mind that Moulin Rouge proves this theory true. This movie not only puts new breath in the rotting corpse of the Old musical formula but adds spectacle and astonishment. The movie, in my mind is a masterpiece to and shows how much Baz Luhrmann has grown as an artist and autuer. The first 40 minutes are simply amazing making you feel as if you were in the transportation sequence in "2001". The story is simple boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl but the girl is promised to another whom she doesn't love. (any of this reminding you of "Shakespeare in love?" But the plot line is simple for a reason. This movie wants to viewer not only to understand the story but to enjoy and be swept away by the visuals that the imagination can create. Some persons may say that this film lacks more multi-dimensional characters and I do not completely disagree but I do like that this is a film for the masses and can be enjoyed by almost everyone from the elderly to the young.Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor accomplish great vocal performances for persons without vocal experience in their background but more astonishing is that Luhrmann would make the actors sing as opposed to getting stand in vocals and then ADRing them in. This single act put Luhrmann on my personal idol list; for any director that makes actors fully commit to a role without compromise is genius. But there is more genius in the Art department of this film which is spearheaded by Luhrmann's wife (who in my opinion should win an Oscar for this film). Not since the "Age of Innocence" has a film blown me away with its incredible dazzling sets (which are real and not computer generated alla Gladiator). While watching this film I remembered "Footlight Parade" and the amazing shows of the Busby Berkley's contained in them. In Rouge the spectacular shows and staging are accompanied by amazing cinimatic genius and great vision. Possibly too much because I felt that I would have enjoyed a little less quick cuts in the big show numbers in order to digest the performance but I was not disappointed in the slightest with what I got. All in all this movie is a must see. Simple is best when creating a story line because a simple story line allows everyone to enjoy the performance because it can be easily read. But when you add a simple story line with great cinimatic vision and practice you get a real masterpiece that should not be unnoticed by the academy or any other critic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phenomenal - after some thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe my first reaction to Moulin Rouge was something very akin to culture shock. Going into the film, I had seen absolutely no summaries, reviews or even previews for the movie. Needless to say, a musical that began with a narcoleptic actor plunging through the roof of an upstart writer's flat was... definitely something of a surprise.I left the movie, with a number of songs firmly lodged in my brain entirely unsure what to say to the array of "how was it?" questions.Twenty-four hours later I'd purchased the soundtrack... and firmly decided I loved the movie.The acting is lovely, the music and singing entirely pretty and more than amusing (to hear old standards in a new setting... wonderful!) It was a very pleasant surprise to find that Kidman and McGregor had musical talent... and even more pleasant to discover that I truly liked both their voices quite a bit. The choreography was amazing, the setting beautiful, the costumes lovely. The plot was enthralling, wacky and heartbreaking in turn.Okay, there were some definite moments that were made entirely of cheese, but they actually seemed to be essential. I was amused.All in all - a rather unexpected and ultimately pleasant surprise of a movie. Lovely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Musicial Romance Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen many musicials (most of them consisting of love) from all over the globe: indian, russian, american, and so forth. This movie about Paris' famous Moulin Rouge is the best movie i have ever seen for musicial romance ever. It tells the story of a dying woman who is at her prime- and a poor man looking for a life, for love. He finds her and falls in love and the story goes on from there. One thing good about this movie is that i felt like i was involved in the movie- like i was in a open theater, close to the actors and actresses. It gave me that feeling of love and lust that most romance movies fail to obtain with the audience. Certainly this movie was a bit underrated and with its low box office sum- i do not see a sequel coming in works sad to say. But if you ever feel the need to watch a romance movie- which all of us someday after seeing all the categories of movies; horror, suspense, thriller, comedy, action, war, and classics- we will know that the one that relates to us the most is romance. Superb acting by Ewan McGregor and a near perfect performance by Nicole Kidman. Great songs and a great love story which has the usual man in the middle causing havoc. Out of ten stars i give it a nine, mainly because it does not contain the nonstop beat of excitement. Still it is a great movie and i recommend to all to see this movie, sooner or later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Moulin Rouge" is not really a movie in the perfunctory sense, rather it is an experience, and a spectacle. "Moulin Rouge" is visually stunning in it's cinematography, staging, and costuming. The musical is reborn. The dialogue and fusion of contemporary song lyrics are seamless-- truly inspired. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are simply fabulous. The setting is 1899 at the Moulin Rouge in the "Bohemian Revolution" that virtues Truth, Beauty, Freedom... and most of all Love. The introduction of young writer Christian (McGregor)-- Love's champion though he has never been in love-- drew me in. The woman who will be the love of Christian's life, Satine (Kidman), is a beautiful and isolated courtesan, who professes that she is not allowed to love. What a wonderful setting for classic tragedy, and great music along the way. The first few minutes of MR is disorienting, until the realization: "This is a musical. Deal with it." The lyrical element is like a genetic code to this movie. The characters come alive through their singing. McGregor is believable as the writer, Christian, experiencing love for the first time. Kidman as Satine balances the tragedy and humor with grace and style. Both are great singers. John Leguizamo as Toulouse Lautrec is surprising as the story's muse. Great work here. The movie must get points for having the audacity of doing a musical number of Madonna's "Like A Virgin" performed entirely by dudes. See the movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best movie I have ever experienced.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, somebody commented how, if Ridley Scott could make ancient Rome seem real, why couldn't Baz Luhrmann do the same for 1900's Paris? Let me ask one question--when you read a love story, do you think of the handsome prince and the beautiful princess in their fairy tale castle, or do you think "Boy, I wonder how they run the plumbing in that thing?"There's three responses to that question. 1. "I don't read love stories." If that's your answer, stay away from Moulin Rouge. 2. "Well, princes and princesses still need to use the facilities, right?" Again, stay away. If you answered "And the castle probably has beautiful tapestries, and the stars always shine directly overhead", then get to the theater now. You won't want to miss this.Moulin Rouge is a story. We experience the story, just as (in many ways) our imaginations would allow us to experience a story we are read. The imagery is beautiful, captivating, and totally unrealistic. We are immersed in the story, not the nitty-gritty details of the setting. What we see is not Paris, 1900. What we see is what we feel.Let yourself be captivated. Let yourself be mesmerized. Let yourself feel this story. If you can do that, it will touch your soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite my dislike of Nicole Kidman, I decided that this was a movie that I needed to see. I truly have never seen anything like it. It's a musical, set in 1899, that uses sappy 1990's love songs. The costumes, the sets, the singing, the dancing, the love story... everything is amazing and inventive. Ewan McGregor's voice is absolutely beautiful (I must say, I was quite surprised). Normally, if I cry at movies at all, I do so at or near the end. But Chrisian, Ewan McGregor's character, made me cry the first time he sang to Satine (Nicole Kidman). It is very over the top, but the romance still seems legitimate and believable. This movie is absolutely worth seeing - I will probably go again. The music is amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's All About Love.... Or Is It All About Absinthe?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enough has already been written about the use of music &amp; the luxurious imagery of this film, but one disturbing fact remains uncertain concerning what happens on screen.Things go pretty well up to a certain point, the young writer (McGregor) seemingly recounting his tale, the narcoleptic Argentinian dropping through a rotten floor into his apartments just after he arrives in Paris(if you've stayed in French hostelries you'll appreciate just how possible that would be in some of them!), an occurrence that leads to the meeting with Tolouse Latrec &amp; his troupe. So far so good.Then they take their first sip of Absinthe, a powerful hallucinogenic drink, renowned for introducing people to "The Green Fairy". Sure enough up she pops, in the form of Kylie Minogue &amp; to the voice of Ozzy Osbourne (no stranger to drugs himself). Now the film goes into hyperspace &amp; the imagery aquires a twisted other worldlyness that persists, only broken by the odd reprise of McGregor's character sat at the typewriter tapping out what happened.Glasses of Absinthe are continually popping up throughout the film, suggesting further consumption. McGregor's hotel has another clue, with a faded advert for Absinthe to the right of his window. Although Absinthe was particularly popular &amp; no doubt widely advertised &amp; consumed, the way you are propelled through the gates of the Montmarte region once the first glass has been downed suggests that this is not merely attention to detail.The scenes from then on fit very well with an Acid trip. For instance it may be tempting to say that finding your true love makes you fell that you can dance on air, but is this really Baz Lerhman borowing from Buzby Berkley or Fred Astaire? True he borrow enough from others, but the trend that builds up is suspicious.Perhaps one of the final scenes is the most suggestive. Near the climax the Duke's asassin has a gun which is knocked out of his hand. The weapon exits via a window in the theatre &amp; flies through the nightime Paris air, only to bang into the Eiffel Tower. In a clear breach of perspective the comparative sizes of the gun &amp; tower have changed dramatically, with either the tower being shrunk or the gun being enlarged. Clearly something is not right here.All in all it seems that Baz Lerhman has been playing with our minds, something that Ridley Scott did with such skill in BLade Runner, only Lerhman is more up front about it. Maybe it is simply something else he has borrowed, like all the other references. But this doesn't make it a bad film.I don't think too much should be read into this, even if it's all just an attempt to mess with the viewer's mind. Let's face it what's more surreal that a bunch of kids &amp; a nun in plain clothes suddenly breaking into song for no other reason than there's Nazis approaching? It worked for The Sound of Music &amp; it shouldn't be forgotten that in the world of cinema real life ends when the lights go down &amp; only restarts when you discover that you can't remember where you parked the car ..... &amp; it's raining.On balance Moulon Rogue is a damned good tale, filled with high dudgeon, vivid characters &amp; plenty of laughs. This is odd when compared to the publicity releases &amp; trailers, as I was convinced that it was going to be dreary &amp; dull, being dragged along by my wife who wanted to see it. Quite why the studio publicity machine has chosen not to even so much as suggest that you might well laugh at the antics of the on screen characters is quite beyond me. It's a pleasant surprise to see that Hollywood can still produce something as off the wall as this, which still retains mass market apeal.McGregor &amp; Kidman are excellent...by the way in Ewan McGregor are we really looking at the next James Bond? Kidman is too thin for my liking &amp; should eat a few Mars Bars (Rene Zellwegger in "Bridget Jone's Diary" gained much admiration for her figure don't forget), but her performance can't be faulted. Jim Broadbent as Zeigler is as mixture of coldhearted ruthlessness &amp; deep down softness, with a screen filling persona that is just right for the film. Jacek Koman as the narcoleptic Argetinian provides a wonderfully odd character that I don't think I've ever seen portrayed before. Richard Roxburgh get's his chance to ham it up completely as the Duke, driven to insane jealousy for Satine (Kidman), providing us with a classic villain whom you can almost see twirling his moustache &amp; tying young heroines to the railway line.Sit back, enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but for *very* specific audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I looked for a catalogue of Luhrmann's films for comparison. Turns out there's only two others, and I'd seen both. Goody. So on a highly personalised scale, "Moulin Rouge" is good, but not at the heights of "Strictly Ballroom". And perhaps not up to "Romeo + Juliet", either. So, third of three, but good, nevertheless.The most important thing is, this film is really only geared at a very small percentage of the cinemagoing population. Luhrmann believes in *spectacle* and *music*. If you don't share this belief, nor have a background in golden-age (and silver-age) musicals, you'll be wondering what the hell is going on. Tough. It's still good for you, but I can't guarantee you'll like it like I did.Some scenes are inspiringly good - "Roxanne" to a tango of betrayal is perhaps the high point - and others are just amusingly inventive - the clientele's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" duelling with the "hostesses' "Voulez-Vous Couchez Avec Moi" early on.But to be more critical, the show is a bit, um, busy. The film lacks the centres of calm needed to provide reference for the viewer. The viewer has little chance to catch one's breath and form an opinion of what constitutes "normal" in this world. Without this, we're left with a kind of "anything goes" B-movie feel. But perhaps I'm getting old.Acting-wise, the leads are good, though in different ways: McGregor is sympathetic, but little range is demanded; Kidman shows more range, but leaves a slightly cold feeling. Both sing well enough, but why for God's sake did they have to slip in "I Will Always Love You"?In summary: go and see, but try to watch "Singing In The Rain" first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, here's the deal. I just got back from seeing this movie. I will not bore you with huge descriptions or abundant praise. However, I will say that this movie has become my all time favorite! It is amazing! It's much more than a musical. Although when I heard about this movie I instantly wanted to see it, I was still a bit skeptical. I anticipated alot, but got much more. The acting is superb! Excellent performances from both Ewan and Nicole. Please note, if you have heard the soundtrack and not seen the movie, Nicole's voice is much better in the film. Although I find her singing voice quite beautiful! There is not much more I can say. I don't want to give away too much because it is a movie that must be experienced. So if you are at all curious, go see this movie! You won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent Manipulation of Color, Character, and Comedy - The "NOW-Generation's" Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once was not enough to take in all the splendor that is Moulin Rouge. I know. I've seen it twice in the last week. When I first saw the film, I was turned off by the first 5 minutes. It was slow, dark, and made little sense, it was too easily forgotten as well. When viewed for the second time, The first 5 minutes set the stage quite well for the "spectacular Spectacular" you are about to witness.Three "C's" = (olor / (haracter / (omedyCOLOR: A dazzling array of vivid hues flashing before you. Any epileptic individual should NOT see this film. (The first 30 minutes at least). Costumes are brought from dingy black and white antique photos to life with colors that seem to "dance" on the screen. Wonderful "flowing feeling" for the use of the colors.CHARACTER: Ewan McGregor. Remember that name. It will become synonymous with Great acting for many years. The emotion he spilled into each scene carried the storyline straight to your heart. Nicole Kidman had her ups and downs. If it was a "Be Seductive" scene, She portrayed the feeling to a tee. But she lacked the "love-stricken-fool" look that Ewan held deep in his eyes.COMEDY: The musical score is the real base for the comedy in this film. Each large musical moment is accented by Amazing cinematography, and an appealing display of humor. And if not just the on-screen humor gets you... The remakes, mixes, and mastering of some of pop culture's top tunes will. Placed at perfect moments in the story, the musical numbers add to the overall enjoyment of a well put together masterpiece.----------OVERALL?----------- GO SEE THIS FILM! I assure you, even if you don't walk out thinking you just saw your new favorite movie, or musical, you will still not feel sorry for spending the money on the ticket. Prepare to be entertained in a very NONtraditional manner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visualy stunning but the ending will leave you feeling empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** At the very begining of Moulin Rouge you are told that Nicole Kidman's character is going to die, that in itself is not so bothersome since you haven't gotten to know her and therefore don't feel any emotion yet. Moulin Rouge is a visualy stunning and breath taking movie with lavish art direction, beautiful musical scoring, and colorful costumes. The music is great to hear and is sung in great form. And the acting while not on the same level as the technical aspects of the movie is still applaudable. However after the movie ended I felt empty and somewhat sad, this is because of how the movie concludes. From the begining of the movie right up until the end it is a fast paced and stimulating then like a stake through the heart the music dies and so does Nicole Kidman. The ending while an homage to many opera's like La Boheme is something that should have been happier, I would have rather seen the two live happily ever after. Over all Moulin Rouge is a very good movie but the ending leaves something to be desired</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that this movie was amazing! Everything in it was so cleverly thought up- the scenes, the characters, and of coarse the music. The duets by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor were so enchanting and magical. John Leguiazamo also did a wonderful job portraying his character who was a real person. Hands down to all the cast in the movie. Baz Luhrmann is a genius. He first amazed audiences with Romeo + Juliet, now he is back with Moulin Rouge. A most excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I think this movie is by far the best I have ever seen. Besides the music being absolutely amazing, not to mention by a certainly praiseworthy group of music artists, the whole of this film is no less then `spectacular, spectacular!' The selection of wild, exotic colors blended with the explosive charisma of an all star cast is perfect for one truly entertaining viewing. The cinematography is sheer genius, with some of the best transitions I have every seen, accompanied by some smooth, dazzling special effects. The captivating story line, a purely emotional voyage of dramatic standards, provides a sensation of amplified feeling only captured in those moments of true love. All of this combined with the radiant use of turn of the century clothing, set to the beat of modern generation's musical influences. With a superior cast, this group of inspiring performers outdo themselves again and again throughout the film. Also, I have to mention that the cast vocals are totally stunning! Even the soundtrack does justice to the essence of this movie. I'm sure you'll never expect what is ahead if you haven't seen this flick yet!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Baz Luhrmann's "Romeo + Juliet" (1996) was Shakespeare for the MTV generation, "Moulin Rouge" is Gilbert &amp; Sullivan on ecstacy.Laurmann's over the top portrait of turn of the century Paris is an explosion of sound and color that leaves the audience dizzy, disoriented, and begging for more. Its so sad it's being seen by so small an audience. This is a big, bold, daring, tasty, entertainment extravaganza that blows the doors off the theater. It's everything a movie should be, and then some. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are surprisingly appealing in their doomed love affair, and Jim Broadbent's brilliant turn as Zidler is in itself, worth the price of admission. A send up of Madonna's "Like a Virgin", with the rotund and whiskered Zidler as the blushing maiden should go down as a classic in cinematic comedy. From the love triangle, to the play within a play; from the mustache twirling plots to the wild score and breathtaking choreography, Moulin Rouge stands in a class by itself. So inventive and so beautiful are the production design and cinematography that they could literally stand alone. Laurmann propels us through the mean streets of Paris at breakneck speed, treats us to a magical waltz on moonlit clouds, and even serves up a glittering green fairy and a chubby faced singing moon. He jams the screen with illusions to other films ranging from "American Beauty", "Titanic", "Singing in The Rain", and his own "Strictly Ballroom." One can only hope that this under-appreciated effort will one day be recognized for the masterpiece it is. Bravo Baz!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never mind about polarising the reviewers (or at least the professional ones) - this movie polarised me. The production is spectacular and lavish, the set design is outstanding but stylistically I was left cold.It's not entirely Baz's fault. He's more of an addict than a pusher, even though I know it was him sliding the needle under my skin. I felt dirty and used, even as (or because) I enjoyed the spectacular. Was I being cynically exploited (as other reviewers have suggested) by someone that was simply out to sell a product, or was I being offered something that the purveyor believed was a valuable insight into the inner workings of society?I can cope - cringeworthy as it was at the time - with 'The hills are alive with the sound of music'. I have more trouble with the love scenes. It appears that both Christian and Satine are incapable of expressing their emotions except through the regurgitation of lyrics from popular music. I find it hard to empathise with characters who pledge their undying love for on another by using phrases equivalent to 'In the words of Dolly Parton, "I will always love you"'. To be sure, musicals are based around scenes where emotions are expressed in songs, but they also have love scenes where the characters talk to each other rather than quote each other song lines.I am not immune to having had a song stuck in my head, or to associating songs with emotions and relationships. However, I do not confuse the song for the feelings. If being a romantic is shorthand for ringing up radio stations to get them to play 'our song', I'd have to say that I'm not a romantic. To me, being romantic involves a lot more - and at the very least it means refusing to express emotions at second-hand, which I see as a form of dishonesty.Baz's characters are emotional vampires, with no emotion but what they can suck from the carcass of popular culture. Maybe that was done deliberately. Maybe Baz meant this film as a satire on our obsession with living life vicariously. Certainly the overall effect was of a caricature, something larger than life - a fairy tale romance - which our post-modern sensibilities will judge as no more than pleasing fiction. The problem is that everyone has to be in on the joke for this to work properly.I feel that the film faultlessly panders to the lowest common denominator, where love becomes its own caricature and is debased in the process. Technically the film is a work of art, but it ends up feeling like a rock video clip - all style and no substance. I liked this film but hated doing so. Maybe the style was a cynical attempt to manipulate the audience.

		<fullReview>If Shakespeare could write a new play today, and Cezanne could design the set you might end up with something like "Moulin Rouge". This is a sweet little nightmarish dream sequence from beginning to end. The music, interwoven throughout without noticeable effort to chisel it into the plot, was beautifully done. I was moved to tears by the performances (and this time it wasn't because the acting was terrible). I loved this movie. It was purely flawless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge was as wonderful a piece of eye candy as I've ever seen. The music was incredibly inventive, creative, and playful, and the visuals were as addictive as the "Green Fairy" that the characters regularly imbibed. Baz Lurhmann has scored another hit with the third installment of his "Red Curtain Trilogy". His flare for theater and dramatics really transfers quite beautifully to this film production. An impressive achievement! I've recommended this film to everyone that I know, and all who have seen it have loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It was visually stunning - well worth seeing on the big screen or you'll miss some of the loveliness and glitter. It made me want to dance in my seat. Interesting renderings of some very familiar popular tunes. Ewan McGregor was adorable in this film. Nicole Kidman was beautiful as always. If you like dancing and singing and eye candy, you'll love this.One caution: if you don't like those old Hollywood musicals where the plot is just basically an excuse for a lot of singing and dancing to occur, and wouldn't like them with updated music, either, then don't see it. I happen to love those movies and wish they were made more often these days. I'd compare it to "Hair" or "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" for being a fun musical with modern music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when I thought Baz Luhrman couldn't make another movie as great as Romeo and Juliet, he makes Moulin Rouge. Moulin Rouge is easily so far this years best film and movie soundtrack. The music is what makes this movie. You'll laugh during the Like A Virgin number, cry when Kidman sings One Day I'll Fly Away. All in all, this is an extremely brilliant film. I would say this is the best musical of all time. Not only, musically is it a great movie, but the acting is superb. Kidman and Broadbent are brilliant, McGregor gives an honest performance, Roxburgh is scary, and Leguizamo was decent. Kidman and McGregor also have great singing voices. The rest of the cast have decent voices, (except Roxburgh, but he doesn't sing much.) This should get nominations at the Oscars for best song (a couple of them), makeup, costume, art direction, sound, score, editing, cinematography, original screenplay, supporting actor (Broabent), actress (Kidman), director, and picture( Which I hope it wins)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never mind about polarising the reviewers (or at least the professional ones) - this movie polarised me. The production is spectacular and lavish, the set design is outstanding but stylistically I was left cold.It's not entirely Baz's fault. He's more of an addict than a pusher, even though I know it was him sliding the needle under my skin. I felt dirty and used, even as (or because) I enjoyed the spectacular. Was I being cynically exploited (as other reviewers have suggested) by someone that was simply out to sell a product, or was I being offered something that the purveyor believed was a valuable insight into the inner workings of society?I can cope - cringeworthy as it was at the time - with 'The hills are alive with the sound of music'. I have more trouble with the love scenes. It appears that both Christian and Satine are incapable of expressing their emotions except through the regurgitation of lyrics from popular music. I find it hard to empathise with characters who pledge their undying love for on another by using phrases equivalent to 'In the words of Dolly Parton, "I will always love you"'. To be sure, musicals are based around scenes where emotions are expressed in songs, but they also have love scenes where the characters talk to each other rather than quote each other song lines.I am not immune to having had a song stuck in my head, or to associating songs with emotions and relationships. However, I do not confuse the song for the feelings. If being a romantic is shorthand for ringing up radio stations to get them to play 'our song', I'd have to say that I'm not a romantic. To me, being romantic involves a lot more - and at the very least it means refusing to express emotions at second-hand, which I see as a form of dishonesty.Baz's characters are emotional vampires, with no emotion but what they can suck from the carcass of popular culture. Maybe that was done deliberately. Maybe Baz meant this film as a satire on our obsession with living life vicariously. Certainly the overall effect was of a caricature, something larger than life - a fairy tale romance - which our post-modern sensibilities will judge as no more than pleasing fiction. The problem is that everyone has to be in on the joke for this to work properly.I feel that the film faultlessly panders to the lowest common denominator, where love becomes its own caricature and is debased in the process. Technically the film is a work of art, but it ends up feeling like a rock video clip - all style and no substance. I liked this film but hated doing so. Maybe the style was a cynical attempt to manipulate the audience. Maybe Baz believes that there is nothing new to be said artistically and that all new art can be no more that pastiches of existing works. In any case, I was left in awe of the technical achievements but untouched emotionally.I'm giving this a score of 6/10. That said, I think that it's a great film - possibly a classic, and it makes me wonder why I've given better scores to worse films. See it and marvel.

If you haven't seen this film yet, what are you waiting for? I've seen it three times and each time the audience applauds, which is something I haven't seen in a long time!

		<fullReview>I came with the expectation that this movie would be slightly strange, seeing as the director was the same as the one for Romeo and Juliet. I was not particularly impressed with the filming in Romeo and Juliet, but I admired the rest of the film. Moulin Rouge went way beyond my expectations for a movie. I had no idea the movie was about love, as the trailer had been slightly confusing and vague. What I discovered at the theater was a true gem. The movie very unassumingly takes its place within the category of musical, though the music in no way draws from the plot or the acting, but merely draws you into the story. Most musicals seem ridiculous in the way characters spontaneously break into a song or dance. This movie was in no way ridiculous. On top of that, the songs were familiar. In A Knight's Tale, a use of modern music was attempted, but to some haphazardous effect. In Moulin Rouge, the familiar music was wonderful because it was performed in an entirely new light. For example, I am not at all a fan of Elton John's "Your Song," but Ewan McGregor performed it so beautifully and with such feeling that I could not help falling in love with it. The acting was very impressive and believable, though Kidman was a bit over-the-top, but true to character. On the whole, this movie had a beautiful message to contribute and was expertly and entertaininly conveyed. A delight to watch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moderate improvement over Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much of Moulin Rouge when I first walked into the theatre, having been dragged across town to the theatre by some friends. I simply despised Baz Luhrmann's previous film, the modern adaptation of Romeo + Juliet; I found that he simply took too many liberties with the script and tried a bit too hard to appeal to my generation. So, one can imagine my surprise when a friend of mine called 35 minutes before a showing of Moulin Rouge was to start to announce that he was picking me up to go see it. Well, $10.00 (damned Canadian ticket prices) and two hours later, I was suitably impressed with it.Not surprisingly, the visuals in Moulin Rouge are outstanding. The art direction seems to be far more sophisticated than in R&amp;J, and it really adds to the mesmerizing effect that the film has. The choreography is also outstanding. Surprisingly, the modern songs used in the musical numbers really worked in a queer way - After Jim Broadbent's "Like a Virgin" number, easily the best in my opinion, the audience spontaneously erupted in a frenzy of applause. However, the best thing about Moulin Rouge is the script. Which sucked. Really sucked. How, you ask, it is the script the best part of this movie? Simply put, because the script was so trite, so predictable, so blatantly "heartbreaking", one doesn't need to focus on it; rather, we're all so swept up in the quick cutting and fast-passed visuals that we really don't care about it. Furthermore, Moulin Rouge solves one of the issues that I had about R&amp;J - because I don't care about Moulin Rouge's script, there's no need for me to complain about it. I don't care what Luhrmann did to the script because it doesn't matter to me. All in all, Moulin Rouge was one of the better movies that I've seen in awhile. Don't expect any Oscar performances (though Ewan McGregor had a stunning singing voice- much to my surprise) or writing, but if you liked the visual appeal of Luhrmann's R&amp;J and Strictly Ballroom, give this one a shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came with the expectation that this movie would be slightly strange, seeing as the director was the same as the one for Romeo and Juliet. I was not particularly impressed with the filming in Romeo and Juliet, but I admired the rest of the film. Moulin Rouge went way beyond my expectations for a movie. I had no idea the movie was about love, as the trailer had been slightly confusing and vague. What I discovered at the theater was a true gem. The movie very unassumingly takes its place within the category of musical, though the music in no way draws from the plot or the acting, but merely draws you into the story. Most musicals seem ridiculous in the way characters spontaneously break into a song or dance. This movie was in no way ridiculous. On top of that, the songs were familiar. In A Knight's Tale, a use of modern music was attempted, but to some haphazardous effect. In Moulin Rouge, the familiar music was wonderful because it was performed in an entirely new light. For example, I am not at all a fan of Elton John's "Your Song," but Ewan McGregor performed it so beautifully and with such feeling that I could not help falling in love with it. The acting was very impressive and believable, though Kidman was a bit over-the-top, but true to character. On the whole, this movie had a beautiful message to contribute and was expertly and entertaininly conveyed. A delight to watch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moderate improvement over Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much of Moulin Rouge when I first walked into the theatre, having been dragged across town to the theatre by some friends. I simply despised Baz Luhrmann's previous film, the modern adaptation of Romeo + Juliet; I found that he simply took too many liberties with the script and tried a bit too hard to appeal to my generation. So, one can imagine my surprise when a friend of mine called 35 minutes before a showing of Moulin Rouge was to start to announce that he was picking me up to go see it. Well, $10.00 (damned Canadian ticket prices) and two hours later, I was suitably impressed with it.Not surprisingly, the visuals in Moulin Rouge are outstanding. The art direction seems to be far more sophisticated than in R&amp;J, and it really adds to the mesmerizing effect that the film has. The choreography is also outstanding. Surprisingly, the modern songs used in the musical numbers really worked in a queer way - After Jim Broadbent's "Like a Virgin" number, easily the best in my opinion, the audience spontaneously erupted in a frenzy of applause. However, the best thing about Moulin Rouge is the script. Which sucked. Really sucked. How, you ask, it is the script the best part of this movie? Simply put, because the script was so trite, so predictable, so blatantly "heartbreaking", one doesn't need to focus on it; rather, we're all so swept up in the quick cutting and fast-passed visuals that we really don't care about it. Furthermore, Moulin Rouge solves one of the issues that I had about R&amp;J - because I don't care about Moulin Rouge's script, there's no need for me to complain about it. I don't care what Luhrmann did to the script because it doesn't matter to me. All in all, Moulin Rouge was one of the better movies that I've seen in awhile. Don't expect any Oscar performances (though Ewan McGregor had a stunning singing voice- much to my surprise) or writing, but if you liked the visual appeal of Luhrmann's R&amp;J and Strictly Ballroom, give this one a shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I highly recommend Moulin Rouge! Baz Luhrman of Strictly Ballroom, Romeo &amp; Juliet fame has reinvented the musical for the MTV generation. Moulin Rouge rocks! Literally! Aside from a couple of slow spots the film is a visual feast for the eyes. The colors, choreography, cinematography, costume design, set design, direction, and editing all combine to make it one wild ride. I must also mention the treat for the ears. Kidman and McGregor prove not only their acting merits but their vocal abilities! McGregor throws himself into his character and sings his heart out. The excitement and joy in his expression just make you want to believe! There was one musical number that I was not expecting and I was completely overjoyed. Judging from the audience reaction in the packed theater the crowd totally whooped that scene up! You'll know which one I'm talking about when you see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like musicals but I loved Moulin Rouge. How many movies do you walk out at the end wishing to see again? This is definitely one to see again (and again).Baz Luhrmann has created a film work of art that sets a new standard for others to strive for. It's not possible to take it all in in one sitting. Like a perfect feast! Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are outstanding in their leading roles and Nicole has the beauty of a translucent pearl (Tom who?).See Moulin Rouge and weep for any love you ever had and lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the Moulin Rouge!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going to see to Moulin Rouge on it's opening night was a night i will remember. Baz Luhrman should be praise for his baby. People may have thought a movie musical was a sure firer flop. Also critics began to doubt it when it was delayed so many times and had to move to different places to be flimed.The acting was excellent. I was a huge ewan mcgregor fan before the movie came out so i always knew he could sing but, Nicole Kidman? She blew me away! I think that the song "Some Day I'll Fly Away" was one of the most touching parts of that movie. And Jim Broadbent! Bravo Bravo! he was amazing! And Like a Vrigin! HAHA!I smell some oscars indeed. Best Actor for Ewan McGregor, Best Actress for Nicole Kidman, Best Supporting actor for Jim Broadbent, Best Set Design, Best Costumes, Best Song for "Come What May" and of course best movie and director.I predict they will all be nomanited but, i'll like to see the movie that can top it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Rouge is "Spectacular, Spectacular!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone with an ounce of common sense, can see that Moulin Rouge is a fantastic movie. Of everyone I have talked to most have said that it is a bad movie, but of everyone I've talked to that has actually seen the movie has agreed that it is a superb collection of music, acting and style. The others have made their opinions based on the trailers shown to the public, and that is the only problem with this movie, the poor (and lack thereof) advertising.Some people complain that movie trailers show too much about the movie and end up ruining it for the viewer. If this was what the Public Relations people from 20th Century Fox were trying to accomplish, then they have gone just too far. First of all, the trailer does not even make it evident that this movie is a musical. Secondly, there is no real clear indication of the plot. The only thing that is clear is that it is held in the early 1900's by the costumes and scenery in the trailer. This movie would have made much more money if the advertising was done better, and the only thing that can help bring in more money is the word of mouth of people who have seen the movie.The plot may be a typical love story, but the movie itself is far from typical. Baz Luhrmann, is not only a director, but an artist. His modern visions give the movie a uniqueness that makes it stand out and will make the viewer want to see it over and over again. A big round of applause has to be given to Baz Luhrmann and Marius DeVries for their work on the greatest soundtrack I've heard in a long time. The soundtrack is so good, that after seeing the movie I had bought the soundtrack the very next day when the stores opened, in fact I am listening to it now as I write this review. People should not just see this movie because it is a good movie, but because it is so unique and different than most people are used to seeing. Very few directors and their movies ever break out of the molds that seem to constrain the rest. Baz Luhrmann has already proved that he is able with his rendition of Romeo and Juliet and Moulin Rouge is no different. Overall, and in every small aspect, this movie is "Spectacular, Spectacular!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The good parts: fantastic visual creativity, Baz Luhrman and his wife (the production designer) went all out to create a no holds barred visual experience, very creative, no expense spared. Its clever that the main characters all have red hair (Nicole Kidman, Jim Broadbent and the Duke) and the "Redness" of the entire production is weird and wonderful. The red blood coughed up by the dying actress (But the dark complexioned writer, Ewan McGregor, stays in the "White Hotel". The weird use of lyrics from old Elton John songs, and other 70's and 80's hits, redone as operatic spectaculars, is creative, but very strained after 5 minutes. Then there is the Australian connection, it was filmed in Australia, Nicole is Australian, it was made by Fox, owned by Australian Rupert Murdoch, and something tells me Baz Lurhman must be an Aussie.The bad parts: cynical use of the same plot from Romeo and Juliet (already done by Baz) and "Titanic", you know beautiful young lovers, evil capitalist with gun-toting henchman ready to "whack" the beautiful boy. How about the "American Beauty" shot of the dying actress in the rose petals? The music is lip-synched, badly. The principals don't even appear to be trying to look like they are singing in some numbers, the actors and the songs are poorly synchronized, they just ran out of time and money evidently.This is a train wreck of a movie, but fascinating in the way that train wrecks are fascinating. It has some sort of family connection to Baron Munchausen and Topsy Turvy. Its hard for me to understand that Baz didn't somehow have something to do with those movies, since the look is so similar. This director is probably very good at making 2 minute music videos, visually arresting, with lip synched lyrics, but will the public accept MTV-the two hour movie? Time will tell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I loved this movie, it is a difficult one to decribe in words. Ewam McGregor takes great songs and makes them greater, when you expect little but for them to be butchered. The speed changes in the film give it almost a roller coaster feel, propelling you through what you are not sure is a musical, or a spoof on musicals. This is honestly a movie I was dragged to by my fiancee, and I didn't expect to even stay awake through it, much less enjoy it, but I found myself going back to see it again two days later.One of the most captivating films I have ever seen.

		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann manages, with Moulin Rouge, to take the fast pacing of Romeo + Juliet (which I did not like) and apply it effectively to this extravagant, musical love story. Kidman and McGregor are the perfect pair. His devastating good looks and her timeless beauty fit the scene perfectly. The wild nights of the Moulin Rouge, the famous French nightclub that provides the dramatic backdrop for this tragic tale, third in the "Red Curtain Trilogy" from Luhrmann. Satine (Kidman) is the tragic heroine, "Sparkling Diamond" of the Moulin Rouge. Christian (McGregor) is the Bohemian writer who becomes Satine's truest love and champion. Her beauty drives the Duke to bitter jealousy, which threatens the two lovers. The trailers may make you feel as if you know the end of the movie, but trust me, you don't!The plot is not complex at all. Its the simple tale of tragic, but pure, love. Satine and Christian represent all that is good, wonderful and right in love and the world; their story shows that love can overcome everything, except nature. The Duke is the evil that can destroy such beauty. All of the relevant details play out in the sumptuous sets of the film. Lavish replicas of the once great club, right down to the elephant, historically acquired for the Moulin Rouge at the World's Fair. The costuming is gorgeous, vivid colors and rich fabrics. Further, there is a wonderfully comical and supportive cast of characters (Zidler, the Unconscious Argentinian, Toulouse Lautrec, etc).And boy can Kidman and McGregor sing!!!! They are outstanding in their duets and can even carry themselves on their own. They don't hide behind backup singers and studio recordings, they just belt the songs out for our enjoyment. The other songs in the film are wonderful, new renditions of old favorites (Like a Virgin, Lady Marmalade, Up Where We Belong, etc). They are relevant and fast paced, in keeping with the movie. (I must note that there was one musical element that my sister absolutely hated -- the singing moon. It was a bit much. :-))This movie is a masterpiece and I will be buying it the moment it comes out on video.My rating for this movie would be off the scale!! Enjoy!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>finally...a movie with something special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think there's any way I could talk about this movie without gushing to tell you the truth but it was definitely worth my ten bucks to say the least. While I don't think its for everyone this was by far the most fun I've had in a long time. If you're sick of cheesy Hollywood movies take a look at Moulin Rouge. It doesn't try to pretend that its reality but rather takes the art of storytelling to a whole new level, leaving you breathless as the credits roll.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I loved this movie, it is a difficult one to decribe in words. Ewam McGregor takes great songs and makes them greater, when you expect little but for them to be butchered. The speed changes in the film give it almost a roller coaster feel, propelling you through what you are not sure is a musical, or a spoof on musicals. This is honestly a movie I was dragged to by my fiancee, and I didn't expect to even stay awake through it, much less enjoy it, but I found myself going back to see it again two days later.One of the most captivating films I have ever seen. Thanks Baz.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann manages, with Moulin Rouge, to take the fast pacing of Romeo + Juliet (which I did not like) and apply it effectively to this extravagant, musical love story. Kidman and McGregor are the perfect pair. His devastating good looks and her timeless beauty fit the scene perfectly. The wild nights of the Moulin Rouge, the famous French nightclub that provides the dramatic backdrop for this tragic tale, third in the "Red Curtain Trilogy" from Luhrmann. Satine (Kidman) is the tragic heroine, "Sparkling Diamond" of the Moulin Rouge. Christian (McGregor) is the Bohemian writer who becomes Satine's truest love and champion. Her beauty drives the Duke to bitter jealousy, which threatens the two lovers. The trailers may make you feel as if you know the end of the movie, but trust me, you don't!The plot is not complex at all. Its the simple tale of tragic, but pure, love. Satine and Christian represent all that is good, wonderful and right in love and the world; their story shows that love can overcome everything, except nature. The Duke is the evil that can destroy such beauty. All of the relevant details play out in the sumptuous sets of the film. Lavish replicas of the once great club, right down to the elephant, historically acquired for the Moulin Rouge at the World's Fair. The costuming is gorgeous, vivid colors and rich fabrics. Further, there is a wonderfully comical and supportive cast of characters (Zidler, the Unconscious Argentinian, Toulouse Lautrec, etc).And boy can Kidman and McGregor sing!!!! They are outstanding in their duets and can even carry themselves on their own. They don't hide behind backup singers and studio recordings, they just belt the songs out for our enjoyment. The other songs in the film are wonderful, new renditions of old favorites (Like a Virgin, Lady Marmalade, Up Where We Belong, etc). They are relevant and fast paced, in keeping with the movie. (I must note that there was one musical element that my sister absolutely hated -- the singing moon. It was a bit much. :-))This movie is a masterpiece and I will be buying it the moment it comes out on video.My rating for this movie would be off the scale!! Enjoy!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was beautiful. The whole light/dark and use of colors was awesome. I love Lurhmann's work (ie Romeo and Juilet). The acting was nothing special, but then its hard to develop a character that we are used to when they randomly break out into a song.The story was mostly predictable, but it fit the "storybook musical" feel. You pretty much know what is going to happen, but the fun part was actually seeing it happen. Its a feast for the eyes. The music on the other hand was weird. The modern score was cool at times, but sometimes it seemed out of place, and way too stupid (like when he keeps saying "love lift us up where we belong, all we need is love". But there is something funny about a grizzled deep throated Argentinean singing Roxanne. I think that a few of the songs were original, the one that he sings when he meets Satine, and the "secret love song to remind them of their love"The choreography was nothing short of fabulous, it was in the sense of a full blown musical. The costumes... They were period, but with that feel that you could almost wear some of it out on the street today. I think that this is a movie that will set some trends, especially for women. I think that we will see a lot of that stunning red lipstick. But also things like corsets and fishnets. Everything in Satine' s wardrobe is amazing. She never looks less then glamorous, even when all she is wearing is a sheet and there is just something about Nichole Kidman in merrywidow and thigh-highs.I liked the movie for the style that it was done in. Everyone i went with complained about how it was badly acted and the plot lacked (although the movie was a remake of a 1952 version http://us.imdb.com/Title?0044926). I think that this movie could be watched over and over just because it is so beautiful. There is always something that your eyes draw to. I'll buy the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that the "El Tango de Roxanne" scene may be the finest ever filmed. Period! Ewan McGregor shows such a breadth and depth in this movie. His other work has showcased his range, but never has one picture shown all of it. Nicole Kidman was a revelation. I'd never thought of her much one way or the other before this movie, but she was wonderful. The supporting cast were all brilliant.If there aren't at least Academy Award nominations for the 6 or 7 main characters, Baz Luhrman, set design, costumes and best song; then there is no justice in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daring, and mostly successful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is a refreshing break from today's world of test-marketed, demographically targeted, homogonized hollywood garbage. Loosely based around the myth of Oprheus, it's obviously the realization of Baz's dream rather than the result of committees and rewrites based on test screening report cards.The first half of the movie is dazzling and inventive, shockingly fun and surprisingly light on its feet. The movie slows a bit in the second half and gets more serious, but for me it still pulled it off quite nicely. Sure, it doesn't succeed all the time, and I would have edited it down about 10 minutes (mostly in the rehersal for the show-within-the-show), but so what? This is not a *perfect* film, this is a *very, very good* film.I completely understand why some people don't like Moulin Rouge. The movie takes a lot of chances, and isn't afraid to do completely unconventional (even absurd) things. This is not a "safe" movie in any sense of the word. To enjoy it, you really have to just let Baz take you through his vision; if you expect it to cater to your preconceptions of what a movie or musical should be like, you're going to be disappointed.However, if you've got any imagination at all, and you want to see something truly different -- go see this film right now. It really is something special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Baz Luhrmann is easily one of the most important filmmakers of our time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann is a freakin' genius.The man behind the 1996 visual orgasm that was William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet has done it again. This time, he hasn't breathed a taste of modern life into the Bard, but rather an even deader art form: the cinematic musical.Yes, Woody Allen tried it a couple of years ago with Everyone Says I Love You. But while Allen's material hasn't felt fresh since well before he ever laid eyes on his step-daughter, Luhrmann has injected innumerable pop references into his ode to Paris circa 1899.A young writer named Christian (played by Ewan McGregor), new to gay Paree, falls for a courtesan named Satine (Nicole Kidman) upon his first visit to the outrageous club Moulin Rouge. Okay, so the metaphor in the movie can be a little obvious at times... The story from there is interesting, but incidental. As shot by Luhrmann, these two are so captivating a screen couple the remainder of the film could involve them singing about poor penmanship and it would be worth admission.McGregor is every bit the smoldering star he promised he'd turn out to be, and Kidman once and for all proves that she is perhaps the most photogenic woman on the face of the planet. Both turn in surprisingly good vocal performances, and have no trouble carrying this picture.Luhrmann smothers every scene in overwhelming colour; even his usage of sepiatones or black and white shots are dripping in style and hue. The supporting cast is breathtakingly talented. Kudos to the casting agents and/or executives who fanagled the likes of Jim Broadbent as the sweaty, greedy, worldly bossman; and whomever it was that foresaw Richard Roxburgh as the ferociously needy Duke of Worcester should be summarily knighted.Luhrmann's vision in creating Moulin Rouge is almost incomprehendible. Four parts music video, three parts Picasso and five parts chocolate mousse, this film should take a number of Oscars next year; the Academy may as well hand over the best musical score statue now, and be surprised -- be very surprised -- if Luhrmann isn't nominated to walk away with the best director prize.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved almost every second of this movie, hopefully this film will reinvigorate the musical genre. It really is a fantastic experience. Watching the film reminds one why you first started to attend the movies. The acting although slightly over the top by some is perfectly suited to their roles. Nicole Kidman is very impressive in her role and seems to now be in complete control of her craft, delivering on the promise that she showed in "Eyes Wide Shut" and "To Die For". Ewan McGregor is also very fine, and they both deliver the goods admirably when it comes to the singing. The musical numbers are simply inspired with the Roxanne Tango, Ewan McGregor singing Your Song for the first time, and Like A Virgin being personal highlights. The film itself is very funny but you may find that the tone changes somewhat in the second half and you should prepare yourself for it, it definitely tugs the heartstrings a little bit. The early sequences are very dazzling and fast moving reminiscent of "Cabaret" whilst the I believe the plot I believe can be interpreted as being a modern day version of "the red shoes". The costumes and sets are very impressive and pleasing to the eye as is every other facet of the film. Director Luhrmann has shown great visual panache in the creation of this wondrous film and turned what was an audacious undertaking likely to be rubbish into the benchmark by which future musicals will be judged. Overall, this is the best film that I have seen this year and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who loves music, movies or life. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was enchanting, and that's the best word for it. You feel almost like you've been pulled into another world, leaving all your cynicism at the door. This movie takes all of your guilty pleasures, all the things you love to love all alone, and makes it okay to love them right in broad daylight with everyone watching. It is intoxicating in its beauty, surprising in its originality, and utterly dreamlike. Ewan McGregor, who's not such a shabby actor in previous works, outdoes himself time and again - the "bohemian ideals" he espouses (truth, beauty, freedom, and - above all things - love) are clearly shown in every expression, be it lovelorn, tormented, or wholly joyous. Nicole Kidman turns in a solid performance as well, sometimes hilarious - sometimes poignant. It is, however, Mr. McGregor's film."Moulin Rouge" captures the quintessential nature of life - that everything we think is bad can be good and that everything we think is good can be bad, and that everything - good or bad - is magical and wondrous and should never be discarded as unworthy. Greed, lust, purity, artistic ideals, betrayal, jealousy, sacrifice, salvation, truth, and love triumphant even in tragedy - it's all here, wrapped up in a package that takes your breath away and makes you laugh, cry, and sing (and yes, you'll already know some of the words). A masterpiece of cinematography, choreography, effects and wardrobe, this film will not change your life...it will remind you why you live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly, I had high hopes for this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been anxiously awaiting the opening of Moulin Rouge ever since seeing a full-color spread of the movie months ago in Vanity Fair. I should probably preface this by saying that I'm a real fan of the great Hollywood musicals, so my expectations were really high. After seeing the movie, I can't decide if I was disappointed, insulted or just plain exhausted.The film's frantic pace left me feeling drained. With all the money spent on lavish sets and costumes, it would have been nice for Baz Luhrman to let us actually see and enjoy some of the images, instead of hurling us into the middle of the action and then pulling us out again at break-neck speed. It had a schizophrenic plot that teetered between goofiness (come on, a singing moon???) and tragedy. Is it a farce, or is the film taking itself seriously?I think I could have gotten past the use of modern songs in a turn-of-the-century setting if they hadn't been used in such a hokey way. For example, Toulouse-Latrec and his cronies kept showing up to chime in during certain songs, reminding me of the chimpmunks who sang "Blue Moon" in "Babe." And why were they climbing up the roof of Satine's ridiculous boudoir that was housed inside a giant elephant???I do have to give credit to Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor for putting in excellent performances and surprisingly good singing. But their presence was overshadowed by Luhrman's nightmarish eye candy. If he had gone for more substance and less razzle dazzle, he would have made a wonderful movie. Instead, I don't know what the heck it was, but I think one movie critic described it best -- "An assault on the senses."</fullReview>

I was stunned to discover that Nicole and Ewan were the actual singers of the songs. Just amazing. Ewan McGregor, pleasant those I've found him in the past, wasn't until now one of my favourite actors. After this film, I fell completely in love with his depiction of a man in love. He was so convincing and sincere - and gorgeous! Nicole of course is always gorgeous; just didn't realise she could sing too. A whole new career for both of them!Baz Luhrmann has done it again. "Strictly Ballroom" is one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen and he's hit the target once more with Moulin Rouge. I've recommended it everyone I know and even the male members of my family enjoyed the movie. In fact, I can't wait to see it again and I don't often pay twice to revisit a film at the cinema (too expensive). But this time, I'm dying to see the whole thing again (and probably again, and again - especially when it comes out on video!). Congratulations, Baz, Nicole, Ewan and the whole cast!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Unique Film of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing the well-talked about "Moulin Rouge" with this review in mind ever since I left the theatre, and I have no idea to start. There's just too much swirling in my head about this very classy piece.I suppose I can start by saying that Moulin Rouge is one of the most unique, innovative, and original movies in recent years.Directed by Baz Luhrman (William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, Stricly Ballroom), and set in the end of the 19th Century Paris, Moulin Rouge is the story of young Christian (Ewan McGregor) a writer in his first experiences in the Bohemian Underworld of Paris, and the lovely Courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman), a well-endowed showgirl of the infamous Moulin Rouge Club/Brothel, and their ill-fated love affair. However, the club manager (played by Jim Broadbent) signs over the deeds to Moulin Rouge and ownership of Miss Satine to the Duke of Worcester (Richard Roxbourgh) in exchange for his funding for the greatest show Moulin Rouge will ever produce, and thus begins the ever-twisting love story of this magnificent movie.The performances of Mr. McGregor and Ms. Nicole Kidman (who, I might add, has never looked more gorgeous then she does here) are to say the least their best yet. Their love is believable, it's real, through the way they portray the character's emotions. No fabrication here like you see in your average romantic film. Cheers also to the exceptional works of John Leguizamo and Jim BroadbentThis film is both a musical and a love story, and Moulin Rouge is like nothing I've ever seen in either regard. The music is very important in this movie. One of the first true musicals to come out just for the silver screen in many a year, it uses what is called Anachronistic Music, meaning songs that don't normally coincide with the setting of the movie nor would you ever hear that kind of music if you were actually there. You'll hear from the cast bits from and pieces of "I'll Always Love You", "Roxanne", "Smells Like Teen Spirit", and even a full rendition of "Like A Virgin", as well as the fresh Operetta pieces, R&amp;B, and Pop Singles made especially for the movie. The anachronistic music is used remarkably well, and it's one of the most innovative scores I've ever heard.The one thing that grabbed me over everything else is the cinematography and the setting design. Baz has quite a bit of fun with the camera with this one. There's a lot of coreography in the movie, and the camera becomes a dancer itself. You wouldn't expect a musical/love story to be such a visual tour de force, and I didn't expect it either, and it made me dizzy from time to time. He uses some nifty tricks such as pulling individual frames from the film reel (so that the film purposely hops and skips) and speeding up or slowing down the speed of the film, using both techniques together with the pace of the music. Concerning the setting, Baz has taken a somewhat realistic setting and turning it into a virtual fantasy world. He uses CGI rather for an artistic effect rather then for eye-candy like most films tend to show, and the result is a specacular world filled with illustration and imagination. The costumes, make-up, and set designs are incredibly elaborate, dazzling, and almost overdone. Truly one of the most beautiful films to come out in a long time.I can almost guarantee that Moulin Rouge will make an appearance at this year's Golden Globe and Academy Awards. Here's what I think it will show in- Nominations in Cinematography, Musical Score, Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Actor, Best Actress, and above all Costume Design.This is the first truly superb film of the summer, and quite possibly will be one of the best of the year. If you haven't already seen Moulin Rouge, do so as soon as you can. I wouldn't recommend it to a person with little appreciation for Avant Garde moviemaking, but I'd recommend it to everyone else.</fullReview>

And they are both lovely to look at. I think the pop songs are going to make this a story that will be accessible to most anyone. It's over the top, but that makes it all the better. Kind of like Caberet, songs not furthering the plot, but mirroring the plot. And that Tango scene....I couldn't move my eyes away. It was so stunning to watch.Don't miss this one.Scott</fullReview>

But while Allen's material hasn't felt fresh since well before he ever laid eyes on his step-daughter, Luhrmann has injected innumerable pop references into his ode to Paris circa 1899.A young writer named Christian (played by Ewan McGregor), new to gay Paree, falls for a courtesan named Satine (Nicole Kidman) upon his first visit to the outrageous club Moulin Rouge. Okay, so the metaphor in the movie can be a little obvious at times... The story from there is interesting, but incidental. As shot by Luhrmann, these two are so captivating a screen couple the remainder of the film could involve them singing about poor penmanship and it would be worth admission.McGregor is every bit the smoldering star he promised he'd turn out to be, and Kidman once and for all proves that she is perhaps the most photogenic woman on the face of the planet. Both turn in surprisingly good vocal performances, and have no trouble carrying this picture.Luhrmann smothers every scene in overwhelming colour; even his usage of sepiatones or black and white shots are dripping in style and hue. The supporting cast is breathtakingly talented. Kudos to the casting agents and/or executives who fanagled the likes of Jim Broadbent as the sweaty, greedy, worldly bossman; and whomever it was that foresaw Richard Roxburgh as the ferociously needy Duke of Worcester should be summarily knighted.Luhrmann's vision in creating Moulin Rouge is almost incomprehendible. Four parts music video, three parts Picasso and five parts chocolate mousse, this film should take a number of Oscars next year; the Academy may as well hand over the best musical score statue now, and be surprised -- be very surprised -- if Luhrmann isn't nominated to walk away with the best director prize.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved almost every second of this movie, hopefully this film will reinvigorate the musical genre. It really is a fantastic experience. Watching the film reminds one why you first started to attend the movies. The acting although slightly over the top by some is perfectly suited to their roles. Nicole Kidman is very impressive in her role and seems to now be in complete control of her craft, delivering on the promise that she showed in "Eyes Wide Shut" and "To Die For". Ewan McGregor is also very fine, and they both deliver the goods admirably when it comes to the singing. The musical numbers are simply inspired with the Roxanne Tango, Ewan McGregor singing Your Song for the first time, and Like A Virgin being personal highlights. The film itself is very funny but you may find that the tone changes somewhat in the second half and you should prepare yourself for it, it definitely tugs the heartstrings a little bit. The early sequences are very dazzling and fast moving reminiscent of "Cabaret" whilst the I believe the plot I believe can be interpreted as being a modern day version of "the red shoes". The costumes and sets are very impressive and pleasing to the eye as is every other facet of the film. Director Luhrmann has shown great visual panache in the creation of this wondrous film and turned what was an audacious undertaking likely to be rubbish into the benchmark by which future musicals will be judged. Overall, this is the best film that I have seen this year and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who loves music, movies or life. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was enchanting, and that's the best word for it. You feel almost like you've been pulled into another world, leaving all your cynicism at the door. This movie takes all of your guilty pleasures, all the things you love to love all alone, and makes it okay to love them right in broad daylight with everyone watching. It is intoxicating in its beauty, surprising in its originality, and utterly dreamlike. Ewan McGregor, who's not such a shabby actor in previous works, outdoes himself time and again - the "bohemian ideals" he espouses (truth, beauty, freedom, and - above all things - love) are clearly shown in every expression, be it lovelorn, tormented, or wholly joyous. Nicole Kidman turns in a solid performance as well, sometimes hilarious - sometimes poignant. It is, however, Mr. McGregor's film."Moulin Rouge" captures the quintessential nature of life - that everything we think is bad can be good and that everything we think is good can be bad, and that everything - good or bad - is magical and wondrous and should never be discarded as unworthy. Greed, lust, purity, artistic ideals, betrayal, jealousy, sacrifice, salvation, truth, and love triumphant even in tragedy - it's all here, wrapped up in a package that takes your breath away and makes you laugh, cry, and sing (and yes, you'll already know some of the words). A masterpiece of cinematography, choreography, effects and wardrobe, this film will not change your life...it will remind you why you live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** This has been the first movie to impress me on all accounts since I first saw "Breakfast At Tiffanys". Basicaly, it starts out with a young writer, Christian (played to perfection by the addorable Ewan McGregor), moves to Paris in 1899. He quickly gets invovled in a group of actors, with the lovable John Leguizamo playing Toulouse Lautrec. He then quickly finds himself quickly into the Moulin Rogue and meets Satine, played by Nicole Kidman. Which results in a hilarous first meeting, she finds that he is not the Duke that she is suppose to be "impressing". This quickly leaves to a passionate secret love affair between Christian and Satine, behind the Duke's, who is also taken by Satine and wants her to himself, back. But little to any of them know, is that Satine is slowly dieing.I've been waiting for years for a good musical to come along, and it looks as if i finally got my wish. A GREAT soundtrack, tho i have one complaint, where's the version of Madonna's "Like A Virgin" on the soundtrack? 10 out of 10 stars easily. I'm going to be completly disappointed if it doesn't get alteast 4 oscars nods. This is a must see hit movie of the summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A breathtaking masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There aren't really any words I could use to describe the experience of seeing Moulin Rouge for the first time, but I will try.Baz Luhrmann is known films that distance the audience from reality by use of dance (Strictly Ballroom), language (Romeo + Juliet), and music here in Moulin Rouge. Yet in all of his films, the music conveys the meaning and the depth of emotion of the scene far better than just dialogue alone.Some people have criticized Moulin Rouge for its use of non-period songs, but in my opinion, the music is what brings the emotional story of Satine and Christian to life. Luhrmann draws upon songs familiar to us--ones likely to tug at our personal heart strings and call up memories of our reactions to the songs--and interweaves them spectacularly to amplify the feelings going on at the time. I couldn't imagine any sort of music that could define the particular feel of the Moulin Rogue club scene better than the mix of "Lady Marmalade," "Teen Spirit" and the "Can Can." It gives a sense of the spectacular, the thrill, the eroticism, and the bigger-than-life sensation, to which defies description. The Roxanne tango sequence was exceptional, using both the dramatic situations of the characters and the expertly woven dance sequence together, and using the music to build it into one the most brilliant sequences of cinema I've seen in a long time.The images of the film are as breathtaking as the musical scope. The first half rushes by in an absinthe-induced dream, where the people and situations seem bigger and brighter, and the hallucinations are just as real as the people. The style of the drab outer Parisian world seems to be cut from the same cloth as the early films and the degaurre-type photography, giving the sense of the old and the classic, but also the sense that the outer, older, non-bohemian world is somehow out-dated to the colorful, larger-than-life underworld of the Moulin Rouge. And then, just as the theatre of the period was beginning to, the style swings from spectacle to more realistic. Yet even these more down-to-earth scenes have visually exceptional and other-worldly quality. As for the acting, I think that as a whole, the ensemble cast did a fabulous job, getting back to the styles of acting at the time, when pratfalls and circus-like conditions were the norm.As to the plot, I've heard many people call it "fluff," so to speak. The plotline may be simplified, but the story--true love--is something that every human being longs for deep inside. True love, in its most basic form, doesn't need fancy trappings or complicated situations, just as most of the emotions racing around inside our hearts. It's simple, pure, and uncomplicated. And this simple love story, conveyed through a brilliant score and heart-felt acting, has carried away so many people with its scope. That scope doesn't necessarily come from wrinkles in the plotline, but from the scope of the human heart and our capacity to believe in true love.I think that Baz Luhrmann and his team have creating a trancendant piece of literature that has touched many people already, and will most likely be rewarded come Oscar time, whether or not the rest of entertainment year picks up steam.In closing, I would urge you to see it, and appreciate it for whatever it means to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Luhrmann has done it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say I am a little biased-Luhrmann's Strictly Ballroom is my favorite movie. So I expected a lot from Moulin Rouge and thankfully was not disappointed. I can easily see how someone could be turned off by this movie. It really wasn't advertised as a kinetic, quickly-paced musical. So if you weren't expecting that, it would be a shock. And if you're looking for something like Pearl Harbor or Mummy Returns-DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE. To me though, this movie was spectacular! Ewan McGregor has long been a favorite and he displayed his tremendous talent once again as Christian. Who knew he had such a dreamy voice? I think I audibly sighed when he started singing Your Song. In the past I have not liked Nicole Kidman in the least, but she made me change my mind. She was beautiful and was able to pull off the role of Satine nicely. She was aloof one minute and charmingly in love the next. I was enthralled by this movie the minute it started and was completely engrossed until the end. I just can't wait to go see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pudokin was right! Luhrman is too!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Editing is the only original and unique artform in film - Vladimir PudokinI read this quote recently on the Film 100 site and was struck by its truth. No film of recent memory drives this point home so well as Moulin Rouge. If no other talent from this movie is recognized next March, Jill Bilcock had better be. Baz Luhrman demands a breakneck pace for this movie, and Bilcock delivers.The story is simple: a rudimentary love triangle with all the usual outside pressures, including the villain holding the deed, a jealous co-worker, friends banding together to put on a show... the archetypes rattle on indefinitely.The acting is nearly nonexistent. Who has time to emote or construct a persona when the production is carried out a bullet-train speed? Casting then must carry the weight, and it does. Everyone from the leads on down to Warner, the thug, instantly project a character recognizably and completely. However, special kudos must go out to Ewan McGregor and Jim Broadbent for being especially effective in their roles. (And Nicole Kidman should be in every movie made... but that's just my opinion)After all this, you'd be tempted to guess that I disliked the film. I most emphatically did not. I loved it. This is a carefully constructed movie that has nothing to do with fin de siecle Paris and everything to do with youth, beauty, truth, freedom, and love. For those looking for a docudrama (documusical?) recounting the tawdry facts of life in Montmartre at the Moulin Rouge, I advise they hunt up John Huston, Jose Ferrer and their Moulin Rouge. For anyone who wants to understand the ecstacies of forbidden doomed love, of the joys of instant friendships that last a lifetime, however brief those lifetimes, for anyone who needs to learn about the rash painful but unregrettable follies of youth, send them to Satine, Christian, and Baz Luhrman's Moulin Rouge.So much remains to be said, yet I am too overwhelmed to say it all. The witty animations. The spectacular sets and models that serve the storytelling so much better than the real Paris could ever have. A film that does not pretend to be real, but knows it is a tale told for the entertainment and edification of the audience.Oh there are real flaws. Le Chocalate arrives at his big moment without adequate build up. And there is no reason that Leguizamo's character has to be Toulouse-Lautrec. The painter could have been alluded to in a crowd scene and more than fulfilled our historically minded friends. As for me, I'm looking to become a narcoleptic ArgentinianCan a play show us the very truth and nature of love? If Romeo and Juliet manages to, as Shakespeare in Love maintains, so to0 does Moulin Rouge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this one really was an assault on the senses. Your eyes and ears will be overwhelmed, especially at the start of this well crafted tale.I enjoyed one of this director's previous works (Strictly Ballroom) and was underwhelmed by Romeo+Juliet, so went into this with a fairly open mind.Quite frankly the story was ho-hum, but the outstanding performances by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor more than made up for it. Some will find the very 20th century soundtrack in this 1900-set film irritating, but I found it most amusing (especially the Elephant Love Medley and the fantastic rendition of Madonna's "Like a Virgin")And a cameo by Kylie Minogue! How gorgeous!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surrealistic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read all the reviews, most of them praising Moulin Rouge at the highest possible level. I have to be honest: the movie is beautiful and I'm glad I saw it, but the majority of the scenes are so brief and so fast that it's difficult to appreciate the beauty of the film. There is a great chemistry between Kidman and McGregor and their performance is truly unique. The movie is very surrealistic and I prefer more traditional movies. My recommendation: see Moulin Rouge because it will be a new experience and it's worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>shouldn't a musical have original songs?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realize that the modern american musician is unable to come up with anything remotely original to sing, everything sounds exactly the same lately. But, in a musical movie, shouldn't there be a few original songs? Instead Moulin Rouge takes songs from various places, puts different spins on them, and places them at key points in the movie. (For example the first time we see the Moulin Rouge its Lady Marmalade, and Smells Like Teen Spirit that the dancers sing). Why couldn't there have been something original about the story line either? The tragically flawed heroine and the dashing poor hero falling in love is something we've seen thousands of times.However, elaborate sets, fantastic costumes, innovative camera work (particuarly with the green fairy scene, and the first moulin rouge scene), and some strong acting from almost all the characters in the movie really make up for what this film lacks in plot and music. Alright, i'll even forgive them for the music, because it was fun to hear a bunch of 1900 parisian men sing Like a Virgin. Besides, i'm sure to get the rights to all the music in the movie, it must have been a lot of work and money, so I guess they've done alright so far.Anyways I'm giving this movie a 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, if you ever doubted the auteur theory, you should check out"Moulin Rouge". This film is definitely the product of someone'sspecific imagination, not a film made by Hollywood committee.The first half of Moulin Rouge is very nearly a great film, with somesequences that truly astonish. In particular, the number which setsup the play-within-the-movie, and the stunningly funny number byJim Broadbent are dazzling.However, after the Broadbent number the film simply runs out ofsteam as it creeps toward its glaringly obvious conclusion. A lot ofthe 2nd half could have been cut out without anyone missinganything. I think the problem is that the film's wafer-thin plot is notnoticed during the dazzling first half, but becomes just annoyingenough as the film continues.Still, this film is a must-see if you fall into any of the followingcategories: --film buff --musicals buff --"Strictly Ballroom" buff --French history ca 1900 buffMy rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Should there even be any love story movies anymore? I mean, if there is, people always have some sort of complaint. "The poor guy who falls in love with the rich girl has been done before." or "The rich guy falling in love with the poor girl has been done before." There is always SOMETHING that people have to complain about. You know what the movie is about before you go see it, so if you don't like love stories then DON'T see it. Fortunately, I think that this movie had a lot more to offer than a love story. The sets were amazing. The characters were fantastic, and the direction was superb. Some people might say that the male actors are not attractive enough or Nicole Kidman is too white. This is also 1899 Paris we're talking about, and it's no 2001 Los Angeles: the city of fake people. These characters were real, they were genuine in their emotions, although their actions were completely over the top. The contemporary music in my opinion was a fantastic choice. Could they have gone the route of doing their own songs? Yes, but they would not have gotten the same reaction. A movie wants to get its viewers involved. By putting in songs that the viewer recognizes, it makes them pay more attention. The quick moving camera in the first half only helps with pacing. The first half is fast paced fun where the second half is more serious and tries to accomplish more. Be open minded. Do not go to see this movie if you have set guidelines of what a movie should be like. Because this will not apply. Go in there, enjoy it, and have fun, sing along. There won't be another movie like this one at least the rest of this year. I say 9.4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most daring, inventive, kinetic, sweet and fabulous film of 2001.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin with a quick aside to a few of the other reviewers. Never, ever review a film that you haven't seen in its entirety. Doing so reveals an incredible contempt for the medium.Moulin Rouge is quite simply the best film to come out of a major Hollywood studio in quite some time it compares favorably to Fight Club (the movie), Rent (the musical) and One Hundred Years of Solitude (the book).Whether you like it will depend quite a lot on you. You can't just sit and watch Moulin Rouge like you would a simpler movie. You either accept the Universe Baz creates or you don't. I personally find Baz's world exhilarating and embraced it gladly.While the triumph of Moulin Rouge is ultimately the director's--he couldn't have gotten there without wonderful performances by his cast and company (and crew). The cast is exceptional and well chosen. Kidman shines as the courtesan Satine. Her voice is surprisingly warm especially in the Sparkling Diamonds and I'll Fly Away numbers. Ewan McGregor is (as others have mentioned) the real surprise--should he choose he could junk the Movie Star life for the Rock Star life.The supporting cast is, if anything, even better in their roles. Jim Broadbent is simply spectacular--and Oscar worthy--as Zindel. Roxburgh has the toughest role in the film (the villain Duke) and handles it expertly. Leguizamo's (Toulouse-Lautrec) lisp is somewhat off-putting--but apparently true to life. Regardless his energy wins you over by the end of the movie.After my first viewing my single strongest feeling was shock that such a movie made it through the studio process (Fight Club generated a similiar feeling--wasn't that a 20thCentury flick as well?). I can not recommend this movie enough--it is one for the ages. Don't wait for the video or DVD this movie demands to be seen (and seen again and again) in the theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wildest ride of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See this movie. Two hours of kinetic energy that transport you into a world of color, song and dance. From the opening Twentieth Century Fox titles you know this is going to be a different kind of movie. It dares to clash and stand out and scream and go on and on and on, until you give in to the spectacle, and find yourself just one of the many patrons of the Moulin Rouge staring wide eyed and trying to catch your breath. Run-ons abound, but that's the point. This film has no periods or commas, no gentle transitions. It's about constant movement.Besides the glorious dizzy speed, Moulin Rouge is a well constructed and clever story, circling around a love triangle amidst a play that mirrors the events of the production as they unfold. I was reminded of Tim Robbin's Cradle Will Rock, another great movie that used a production of a play, to reveal and test the convictions of characters. Both films use art as a reflection of the artist, and the artist as a reflection of his art. Both explore the financial needs of a production giving way to its integrity. The difference between the two is, Cradle is more cerebral, Moulin is more emotional. Hyper-emotional. Romantic.Moulin Rouge is about love, and what we are willing to sacrifice to keep that love. I loved this movie.</fullReview>

We know Nichole is an amazing beauty, but - surprise Ewan carries a tune! This plot is so saccharine and trite, that even the comedy doesn't quite delight! So bring kleenex, you'll laugh at the absurdity, but you might leave covering your face or crying at the waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has immediately gone into the list of my all time favorites, and I think of myself as pretty damn picky. First of all, how cool is Baz Luhrman, who has created such a daring, visionary work of ART. The stars, Nicole and Ewan prove themselves more than equal to the huge stylistic challenge that is given them in this movie. The visuals are stunning,as is the soundtrack (alright, I did get a little bit of motion sickness till I got used to the demands that were being placed on me as an audience member)...The supporting cast is sensational. Who is this guy Richard Roxburg? Where did he come from? I swear I was laughing so hard at his Duke I nearly peed my pants (a real high point for me was a duet of Like a Virgin with Roxburg and British actor Jim Broadbent). I also found the film deeply moving. I was a mess at the end of it. It's like, you make a decision during the film to either go with it or not. Well I went with this film like I haven't done in years. Brilliant, brave movie-making.</fullReview>

The fast pace of the movie, the jumpy camera work, and the vibrant colors were stunning. I really enjoyed the fast dialogue, the clever musical numbers, and the way crazy characters would pop up from random places. That being said, when the movie calmed down towards the end it lost most of its charm. It went from being overpowering and engaging to sappy and predictable. The finale was a letdown: not because of the tragic ending to the love story but because it lacked the intensity that the beginning of the movie led you to expect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This may be one of the defining films of the decade . . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely write these reviews, mostly because I am rarely moved enough by a film to actually have enough to say. However, after seeing Moulin Rouge, I find that I must comment on it, and possibly on it's place in our society.Most of the other reviews have mentioned Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor's voices, and they are entirely correct. Both of them harken back to an era when movie star were entertainers and not just media concoctions. Less evident but equally important in this film are there acting talents, both of which are prodigious. John Leguizamo pulls off his usual fantastic job, while the other actors are more than equal to their tasks.There are three other pieces to the film that are extremely important, tho. The first, and probably most obvious, is the music - from sweet, to grand, to gutter, the sounds of this movie will blow you away. It's intriguing how it's done, as most musical have entirely (or mostly) original music, while most of this one is new versions of old songs, and medleys, and bits and pieces, and lyrics set to incongruous music. It's almost as though the story is being played out through the top 40 radio of the past 30 years, and it works admirably.Secondly, the costumes and set design. One could not work without the other, but together, they create some of the most beautiful visions I've seen on screen in a long time.Thirdly is Baz Luhrman himself. Unlike many directors, he is completely present in the film, and you feel his personal involvement in this project more than in either of his previous movies (Strictly Ballroom and Romeo + Juliet). Yes, he's somewhat self indulgant, but if it works, this isn't a problem, and it works very well here.If I have any complaint about this movie it's the pacing at the beginning - very, very slow initially, then frenetic. However, it's like a rollercoaster - it builds and builds until the first drop, when everything goes wild and, in the best cases, you experience red shift.I'm going to have to see this movie again, to see if it inspires me as much the second time around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who follows my reviews knows that I reserve wonderful for truly rare cinema. Moulin Rouge is wonderful.I think I hear Fredrico Fellini saying "Here! Here!" out there in paradise. It seems almost fitting that the world lost such a genius as Fellini on Halloween, since his works were always events of the bazaar and often masking greater things. The writers of Moulin Rouge saw a few Fellini films, bet the farm on it.Anyway, except for one, the cast was splendid too. John Leguizino is a show stopper as his version of Toulouse Latrec. Evan McGregor as the love smitten Christian is very good too. Jim Broadbent is dazzling as Zidler. Ok to the "el stinko";?..yep it is Ms.Kidman. Ok so she is pretty. Sunsets are pretty, even beautiful, but they are hardly sexual experts as courtesans are supposed to be. Nicole Kidman as "Satine" the courtesan, is rather like casting Ernie Borgnine as Lancelot, it wouldn't be a fit. She is not a fit. She is pretty and perhaps she can even act, who can say, but a courtesan she isn't.Hollywood is full of sexy young courtesans, pick any one of hundreds and put them in this role and you have a masterpiece. Anyway, go see this movie. It is fun and it will make you laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Art Direction Gone to Waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really expect much more than an interesting visual experience. And had the editing not been done as if cutting hair I might have been able to do so. The quick/stop editing is sloppy work disguised as art. This is the musical for the MTV Generation and for those who are unable to digest a story or film unless given to the audience in form of music video or commercials. I got the feeling that the film's director thought he was being original, but the entire film borrows from so many sources that it could be the most unoriginal movie I've seen in years. I did not like this film at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge" is set in 1899 Paris, where the young poet Christian (Ewan McGregor) arrives in Montmartre and falls for the gorgeous Satine (Nicole Kidman), a courtesan and lead performer at the Moulin Rouge. Satine promises her boss, Zidler (Jim Broadbent), that she'll sleep with the domineering Duke (Richard Roxburgh) in exchange for a face lift to and support for a new play at the Moulin Rouge. Mistaking him with the Duke, she falls for Christian and gets him hired as the writer of a stage extravaganza that will prove her worth as an actress. But there's a problem, (there's always a problem) Satine is dying, but like any die hard stage performer, she realizes that the show must go on.I LOVED LOVED LOVED this movie. I will say this much for Bazz Luhrmann. The man is a stickler for detail. You may remember his directing style from `Romeo and Juliet'. He's a very vibrant director and very quick with the camera movements. Bazz directs movies to keep you on your feet and Moulin Rouge does just that. The movie starts out with a very lamented version of Nat King Cole's "Nature Boy and before you know it, you are drop kicked in to the world of the Moulin Rouge a spicy night club with every color in the sin spectrum with movements and pictures that are very Tex Avery in style. In my opinion, Moulin Rouge is a stroke of genius because it was told as a turn of the century demented fairytale where the juvenile and ingenue didn't live happily ever after. This is a movie to both love and hate. You love it because it is very funny, it uses popular music, therefore you can relate to it, it's about the one emotion that we all can't live without, and the fact that Ewan plays his character so down to earth that you cant help but relate to him. You hate it for a few reasons. Movie musicals and stage musicals share a common hate: they're not natural. You don't break into song in mid conversation to get your point across (wouldn't that be annoying) in normal conversation. Some guys will hate this film because it literally drips with love. The word is used more than any other word in the musical, the set design is littered with hearts and even Nicole's costumes have beaded work in the shape of hearts.Luhrmann did a great job of mixing the elements of musical theater and motion picture to create this movie. Some have said that he was on a mission to reinvent the movie musical. If that is true, he is definitely on his way. So let's ask ourselves a question, why does this work and Evita didn't. Moulin Rouge reaches for that which is popular in society and reduces it to a certain level of humanity (which can be found in Ewan's performance and by the way, I am not slamming Evita at all and I love you Madonna, may you live for ever). Evita did it but lacked the portal of popular music and insanity to deliver it. Being that Christian was a poet, the dialogue is written that way. This could be a problem if it isn't handled right but the cast (mainly Ewan) handles it brilliantly. I will say the same thing for this movie as I said about A Knights Tale before I saw it: Will the recent music work? YES IT DOES and what's cool about it is that the actors ease into the songs and if you're not paying attention, you will miss it. For example, when Zidler tell the Duke that Satine has sought the cleansing words of a priest before she offers herself up to him, he is charged on by the Duke. He immediately starts the lyrics to `Like a Virgin' by Madonna. I watched this in a theater that sat five-hundred people and I was the only one laughing. The other patrons looked at me like I was crazy, then they got it. Were the patrons that stupid? No, Broadbent was that good. Yet there was one dumb guy in the theatre that made the eloquently dumb statement `What was plot of this movie?' HELLO....the plot was given three times in the movie: 1) The love story itself 2) The plot of the play that was financially supported by the Duke 3) In the raunchy and growling version of Tango De Roxanne (yes the sting version)Now we must ask ourselves a question. Was this a love story written around popular music or popular music draped around a love story. I'll let you figure this one out.The actors make this movie work. Most of the acclaim has to go to McGregor for his excellent portrayal as the love ignorant poet in search of a muse. I loved him in Velvet Goldmine. He's just a fantastic actor and surprisingly a wonderful musical performer. I believed him every time he opened. It wasn't Christian that was in love with Satine, it was Ewan in love with Nicole. Nicole was very good in the acting department and I will even say that this has to be some of her best work. In the singing department (and being a singer myself), she might have had a stronger voice with some breath support lessons. I hated John Leguizamo...period.Luhrmann definitely puts this film in your lap and weighs you down with it. It's new, it's old, it's off the scale but registers with you, it's both beautiful and tragic, romantic and playful and a full throttle trip down a demented psychedelic love canal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half of this film is a fun, frenetic romp full of hilarious dialogue and cheekiness. This shall be known as 'the good bit'. Then comes the second half. And just like a kid fuelled on red cordial, the buzz ends sooner than you want to, and with Moulin Rouge, crikey did it end. Unfortunately, the buzz ended exactly at the halfway mark. This shall be known as 'the bad bit.' From that moment on, this is some of the most boring film-making in the history of the world. The good bit -- with Ewan in fine form, Nicole doing a lovely job pretending to sing and the cast so brim full of energy you could power a small town on their vibrations -- neatly glosses over the absolute lack of story. Well, the thinnest story imaginable. But as a chorus of suited blokes would sing, "it's not about the story, it's about love and clever use of modern songs in a turn-of-the-century setting". How much that matters is up to you. The comes the bad bit. When the film comes to a grinding halt in the middle, the bit when it decides to try and be a real movie and less of an experience, this is when you should stick knitting needles in your eyes. The life, soul and spirit is sucked out of proceedings harder than something I can't write here but involves one of the many prostitutes in the film. A shame. Moulin Rouge is a red-hot go at a musical, but realises midway through proceedings that it just can't go on, when in fact it should have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Possibly" is incorrect... Moulin Rouge is simply the best movie ever made. Star Wars was neat. Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, the list goes on... all of these movies are special but ultimately fall short of Moulin Rouge... I can hear the angry voices countering this opinion as I type.Of course. If the world understood all at once, every war would cease. The world would change instantaneously and we all know that won't happen so the reality is that some people can't and won't ever be able to get the clues masterfully presented in Moulin Rouge. These are the same group of people that think Wizard of Oz is simply a coming of age story. So yes, I'll say it again with even more conviction... Moulin Rouge is the best movie EVER made!The most amazing thing about this film is that most of the people in the sold out audience I sat with missed the point. They totally didn't get it. In the Bible, it says that the truth is so simple that even a child could understand. Yet somehow, inexplicably people miss the point. This movie expressed emotions like no other film has dared to attempt. It grabbed me at my deepest point and then went even deeper. Me and the four guys I watched it with were the only ones to watch all the way through the end credit sequence where Baz showed us even more clues. I'd sift throught Baz's trash if I believed he was hiding more clues in there. The director is a genius people - let's pay attention to this guy. He knows something.I feel so lucky to have understood this film. The message was so clear - and I am so thankful.Technically speaking, the film was flawless. Absolutely flawless. Every frame had intention. The designers, the music, cinematography, choreography, editing, sound, and yes the acting. WOW! Ewan, Nicole, and the rest of the stellar cast were absolutely 100% amazing. They poured their souls into this movie. They're not putting teardrops into these actor's eyes - they gave every ounce of themselves to this movie. Every single one of them should win Oscars.As for the director, I would do my best to honor your message. Since I was one of the people that actually understood this film and I'm not saying I'm the only one - I'm sure thousands of people's lives will be changed from the film but the fact that everyone didn't get this film makes me feel like I'm one of the lucky ones. To think some people walked out of this movie and made a comment like: "Well, the costumes were nice at least but I just didn't get it." That's scary! They're at home choking on a mediocre life and that's too bad.Thus...I have an obligation because the truth has been handed to me so it is up to me to honor it... I will love like I've never been hurt, I will sing like no one is listening, I will dance like no one is watching-- I will love and I will be loved in return!Thank you Moulin Rouge...And yes I will write "my story"... only the clued-in ones will get that.(1000000 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film goes on a rollercoaster ride which doesn't stop until the ending credits. It opens on a young writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) who takes us on a view of how he and the famed courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman) met and fell in love. Now if you don't like films that focus on love or have a rather tired plot, don't see this film. However, in spite of the almost weak dialogue at times, both Kidman and Mc Gregor so such a superb job of acting that you really do not care. The sets are absolutely amazing, and Kidman's costuming merely shows what a gorgeous creature she is.The music constantly shifts from one piece of pop music to another, from the Police's Roxanne to Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You. I heard people arguing about the point of that as I left the theatre, but I don't think the songs were meant to be imbued with any deep hidden meaning here. They are just there for laughs and fun. Something that I also loved,(and others hated) was the close up, almost independent film quality that the shots had. It left you with the same sort of artistic feeling that going to Sundance might have, and was just as long (two hours). But again, if that isn't your thing.... My only beef with this film is that I felt the ending was a bit smarmy and contrived, although certainly effective. Here is where Mc Gregor and Kidman show why they are called actors, and manage to take an ending we have seen before and transform it into something that rips your heart out, and then makes you marvel at its beauty. 9/10</fullReview>

Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, the list goes on... all of these movies are special but ultimately fall short of Moulin Rouge... I can hear the angry voices countering this opinion as I type.Of course. If the world understood all at once, every war would cease. The world would change instantaneously and we all know that won't happen so the reality is that some people can't and won't ever be able to get the clues masterfully presented in Moulin Rouge. These are the same group of people that think Wizard of Oz is simply a coming of age story. So yes, I'll say it again with even more conviction... Moulin Rouge is the best movie EVER made!The most amazing thing about this film is that most of the people in the sold out audience I sat with missed the point. They totally didn't get it. In the Bible, it says that the truth is so simple that even a child could understand. Yet somehow, inexplicably people miss the point. This movie expressed emotions like no other film has dared to attempt. It grabbed me at my deepest point and then went even deeper. Me and the four guys I watched it with were the only ones to watch all the way through the end credit sequence where Baz showed us even more clues. I'd sift throught Baz's trash if I believed he was hiding more clues in there. The director is a genius people - let's pay attention to this guy. He knows something.I feel so lucky to have understood this film. The message was so clear - and I am so thankful.Technically speaking, the film was flawless. Absolutely flawless. Every frame had intention. The designers, the music, cinematography, choreography, editing, sound, and yes the acting. WOW! Ewan, Nicole, and the rest of the stellar cast were absolutely 100% amazing. They poured their souls into this movie. They're not putting teardrops into these actor's eyes - they gave every ounce of themselves to this movie. Every single one of them should win Oscars.As for the director, I would do my best to honor your message. Since I was one of the people that actually understood this film and I'm not saying I'm the only one - I'm sure thousands of people's lives will be changed from the film but the fact that everyone didn't get this film makes me feel like I'm one of the lucky ones. To think some people walked out of this movie and made a comment like: "Well, the costumes were nice at least but I just didn't get it." That's scary! They're at home choking on a mediocre life and that's too bad.Thus...I have an obligation because the truth has been handed to me so it is up to me to honor it... I will love like I've never been hurt, I will sing like no one is listening, I will dance like no one is watching-- I will love and I will be loved in return!Thank you Moulin Rouge...And yes I will write "my story"... only the clued-in ones will get that.(1000000 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film goes on a rollercoaster ride which doesn't stop until the ending credits. It opens on a young writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) who takes us on a view of how he and the famed courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman) met and fell in love. Now if you don't like films that focus on love or have a rather tired plot, don't see this film. However, in spite of the almost weak dialogue at times, both Kidman and Mc Gregor so such a superb job of acting that you really do not care. The sets are absolutely amazing, and Kidman's costuming merely shows what a gorgeous creature she is.The music constantly shifts from one piece of pop music to another, from the Police's Roxanne to Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You. I heard people arguing about the point of that as I left the theatre, but I don't think the songs were meant to be imbued with any deep hidden meaning here. They are just there for laughs and fun. Something that I also loved,(and others hated) was the close up, almost independent film quality that the shots had. It left you with the same sort of artistic feeling that going to Sundance might have, and was just as long (two hours). But again, if that isn't your thing.... My only beef with this film is that I felt the ending was a bit smarmy and contrived, although certainly effective. Here is where Mc Gregor and Kidman show why they are called actors, and manage to take an ending we have seen before and transform it into something that rips your heart out, and then makes you marvel at its beauty. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best on-screen experience since "Shakespeare in Love"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Particularly given the slim pickings for grown-ups at the movies, "Moulin Rouge" is the best on-screen experience since "Shakespeare in Love." The two films have a lot in common: they both seek to define love, they both stress the play within the play (always an appealing technique), and they both are about male playwrights seeking the girl of their dreams. Wonderful direction, filming, and editing. It truly will appeal to the MTV generation and their parents. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No words can describe the feeling that I felt as I sat in the theater watching this movie. I usually don't write reviews because a movie doesn't move me to. This movie obviously did. You were so sympathetic and urging to the romance going on in the movie nothing else mattered. Ewan and Nicole made it ever so more wonderful as the perfect match. Their chemistry was like magic and so was the acting. In fact all of the acting was magnificent and you really appreciate it in a film with so many emotions like this one.Again I have to applaud on the directing and color used in the film. It pulled you in entirely and considering what this film is about, thats pretty important. It was all so beautifully well done, there couldn't of been any mistakes. Kudos to everyone for their singing. I loved it and plan to get the soundtrack as soon as possible.A beautiful movie that reached deep down, and touched my soul. See it as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An endeavor of Spectacular! Spectacular! proportions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it will be hard to find a person who having seen this Spectacular! Spectacular! film, is not entertained by it. Even if a movie-goer hated Baz Luhrmann's "Moulin Rouge", I fail to see how the film could be unentertaining for them...Bombast is a quality too often unseen in modern American filmmaking. Aside from "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", there was not a film released in 2000 that was as imaginative and daring as "Moulin Rouge". The film, quite literally, is a visceral and aural feast, and with scenes like Satine's (Nicole Kidman) swingset descent from the rafters of the Moulin Rouge reminded me of being in the theater for "Phantom of the Opera" and seeing the chandelier fall. And while some critics decry that the film uses too many modern pop songs that seem inappropriate in a late 19th/early 20th century setting, I think the songs give the film a universal appeal rather than having it seem artsy-fartsy. Besides, music artists have sampled for years now and people praise it, so why knock Luhrmann for "sampling" pop songs in his musical.I hope that lots of people go and see "Moulin Rouge." It is delightful and sumptuous, brazen and exhilirating, bold and creative. This return to the movie musical wears its heart on its sleeve and is not ashamed to see it. Movie audiences- (parents, take your children) see this film over souless corporate shill like "Pearl Harbor", "Mummy Returns" and "Shrek" (I don't care how cute or clever people say this film is- it is designed simply to sell dolls and Happy Meals). You will be rewarded with a Spectacular! Spectacluar! feast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How wonderful life is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...Now that Mouline Rouge is in the world. First of all, I'd like to apologize to Baz Luhrmann the director, to Nicole Kidman and to Ewan MacGregor, because no matter how hard I'd try to express how wonderful this film is and all the things it made feel, it won't be enough. This film is a total experience of life. I still have in my head all the color, the music, the wonder, the sadness, but most of all...I still feel the love. Mouline Rouge is fierce, is catastrophic, but also magnificent and exhilarating. In every single frame you will find the lust, grandeur and love of the time, but those sensations are as timeless as humanity and so is music, and this is what we experience here. You will doubt your senses, you won't believe your eyes, nor your ears. It will make your skin crawl in every single scene, and when you least expect it, your mouth will be opened wide, your eyes won't be able to blink and your ears will be fed with the most beautiful feast of music you'll ever find in a movie (except Dancer in the Dark). A love story told in a very unique way, like no other in the whole world. The dreamer who believed in love not withstanding he never felt it before; the delicate but beautiful courtesan who moved and felt like real Satin; the evil Duke (Maharajah) who would do everything he could to get the girl; and after all, the place that made all that possible...The Mouline Rouge, a place for dreams, lust, glamour, music, love, and LIFE. A fascinating place, colorful and hyperactive in which a visit was like a taste of Absinthe, well, the whole film is.Now, I'd also like to thank Baz Luhrmann, for bringing this visual feast to life, for giving us a piece of art that reminds us once again what is what we really love from cinema, and a film that will remain in my head forever. To Nicole Kidman for being such an extraordinary person, who like Satin, awakens all my senses just by looking at her. And finally Ewan MacGregor, who is an actor who's always surprising me in everything he does, I don't remember anything I didn't like from him. Overall, a film that is here to stay, so cry, weep, sing, love, and live it....Go visit the Mouline Rouge.Ahhh, after you see this film, you will hate Tom Cruise (even more) for leaving such a person like Nicole.</fullReview>

The trailer doesn't do it justice. McGregor gives the best performance I've seen from him (and who knew he could sing like that! WOW!). I expected a tragic love story, and it certainly is that.

		<fullReview>Not often enough, a film is released that I have to see because I know I must. The last one for me was Titus and the one before was Thin Red Line. These are love it or hate it films. Moulin Rouge had me from the moment it started to the very end of the credits. It promised and delivered audacity. I've read the critics who've written Moulin Rouge is visually spectacular but the story line is weak. The story tells us that love is the most important thing a human can experience. Only those who have never fallen in Love can doubt that. I am on the wrong side of a romantic involvement, but Moulin Rouge reminded me of the power of Love. As for the actors: Nicole Kidman is Incredible and gorgeous(I can only feel sorry for Tom). She sings so well and her face is incredible to look at. Ewan McGregor (who's he?) sings incredibly. Jim Broadbent's characterization and singing are mesmerizing and Leguizamo is a comic, lisping Toulouse-Lautrec. The weaving of movie and MTV music is incredible. (Is that really what Roxanne is about?)Thank you Baz Luhrmann</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High energy and epic romance combine!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" revolutionized the martial arts genre, director Baz Luhrman knew exactly what he was try to accomplish with "Moulin Rouge", and pull it off brilliantly and beautifully. Moulin Rouge is a joy to take in from start to finish, and does for the musical genre what Crouching Tiger did for the martial arts, or maybe more-so. We open on Christian (McGregor), a young, and apparently haunted young poet, who immediately starts enlightening us with the story that makes the movie. The opening scene in the Moulin Rouge is stunningly gorgeous and brilliantly smart, incorporating modern music in an earlier time period, with a large sequence including everything from Lady Marmalade, the hit single from the soundtrack, to a brilliantly operatic version of Smells like Teen Spirit by Nirvana. After the fun and the brilliance of this sequence subsides, the beautiful Nicole Kidman makes her sparkling entrance as the star of the Moulin Rouge with an exciting interpretation of the classic "Diamonds". Meanwhile, Christian is present take sin this event, after being asked to attend by aspiring playmakers (who happened to meet him by hilarious circumstances), trying to convince him to write their play, while getting Statine (Kidman) to star in it. As this event takes place, Satine wrongly mistakes Christian for the Duke, one of her "costumers", and takes him home with her, under the impression that he is interested in doing a little more than a poetry reading. But while Satine and Christian converse (and a little more) they immediately fall in love, and perform a sequence incorporating Blondie, The Wallflowers, and more. Things do not, however, go as planned when the Duke decides he wants Satine for himself, and Satine makes a discovery that will influence both her, Christian, and the Moulin Rouge's existence forever. With dazzling musical numbers, brilliant directing, and wonderful performances by both the two leads (who, by the way, sing their hearts out) and the delightful ensemble cast, mixed with modern hits and classics, this film gaurantees to become a classic. Moulin Rouge could easily start a chain of modern musicals, being appealing to the teen audience, and the adult audience alike, who will enjoy recognizing the music that is sung, and be intrigued by the epic romance that the story provides. The director makes sure not to go overboard with the music and completely forget about the wonderful story that makes the movie. Instead of having pointless characters for comic relief, some of the music serves as that (especially the performance of Maddonna's Like a Virgin) while still maintaining the mood that the director wanted. Overall, Moulin Rouge is a must see for anybody who loves music, theatre, or, most of all, movies. Soon to become a classic, Moulin Rouge is the best movie this year, and quite possibly, one of the most in-genius and beautiful movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale full of sound and fury, but two hours worth?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can certainly give Baz Luhrmann credit for defying, or perhaps more accurately, reinventing convention in his stylistically bold approach to this partial revival of the MGM Technicolor musical cum 2 hour rock video, unfortunately monikered Moulin Rouge. Certainly, there is a lot energy and vitality in this production, and much like his previous work, William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, seems to address the teen audience (although this one seems particularly targeted to adolescent females roughly between the ages of 14 - 17). The film, starring Nicole Kidman and Ewen MacGregor with good supporting work by Jim Broadbent, John Leguizamo, and Richard Roxburgh, chronicles the happenings of a gorgeous courtesan named Satine (Kidman) whom we discover early in the film has contracted consumption. She falls in love with a struggling young writer who becomes involved with the production after a piece of broad comedy that both misses its artistic mark and him as one of the members of the upcoming "Spectacular Spectacular" cast literally falls through the ceiling into his apartment. Naturally, the writer is a hopeless romantic, the courtesan is incapable of love until she meets the writer, there's an evil capitalistic Duke (Roxburgh), with whom Satine must liaison to keep the show from closing, while the kind, fatherly director (Broadbent) tries to bring some wisdom and common sense to all, etc., etc.,etc. Meanwhile there are over-long production numbers that quote old show tunes ("The Sound of Music") as well as more current material (Elton John and Madonna) in a mix that possesses a certain amount of quirky charm but never really jells into anything of substance. This is a film about effect, with art direction that struggles hard to overwhelm the audience ever harder at every turn. Roger Ebert gave this film a positive review, which I am not, but he did make the point that watching this film is like being stuck on an elevator with a circus......I think he had a point. Certainly, the editing flies so fast and furiously at some points that I was tempted to stop an usher for an airplane bag. This was an effort that cried out for relief from a lower pitch to allow the characters the chance to breathe and be, as well establish some sense of reality. Instead, we are forced to deal with types stuck in a high-tech largely formulaic melodrama that is so stuck in its formula that it really makes no attempt to connect with the audience on a more authentic level. As a result, there really is no glue to hold this enterprise together, and what we get is two hours of artifice without soul. I must confess that I was bothered by the title, since the original film of the same name was a great film with such wonderful style and performances. I wanted a warning label like: "Be advised to lower your expectations from the original film -otherwise, your subsequent disappointment might be harmful to your health." I might have hoped for some ironic quirks to relieve the film from its self seriousness, like having John Cusak revive his role from Bullets Over Broadway to play the struggling young writer, or Terry Gilliam to introduce a cartoon sequence. Well, I kid, but don't kid yourself that this movie is anything like worth 2 hours of your time. ** from me on this one.</fullReview>

The choices of songs and so wonderfully performed by all the principles left me breathless.  I wasn't able to take my eyes off the screen because I was so fascinated by the set design, photography, colors, costumes --- I really am running out words to describe how overwhelmed I was by this movie, and I see about two movies a week. This was worth all the exposure to lesser films this year. I am really amazed that I am going so overboard in my praise because it really is not my nature. The last time I was even nearly so impressed was the drama of "Boys don't Cry". This, of course, is very different moviemaking. You must, however, avoid bringing critical notice of some details. It is a fantasy nor reality and must be absorbed as such. Go see it in the best sound theatre available. You will miss much if you don't see it with full surround, best fidelity and a large screen</fullReview>

As a result, there really is no glue to hold this enterprise together, and what we get is two hours of artifice without soul. I must confess that I was bothered by the title, since the original film of the same name was a great film with such wonderful style and performances. I wanted a warning label like: "Be advised to lower your expectations from the original film -otherwise, your subsequent disappointment might be harmful to your health." I might have hoped for some ironic quirks to relieve the film from its self seriousness, like having John Cusak revive his role from Bullets Over Broadway to play the struggling young writer, or Terry Gilliam to introduce a cartoon sequence. Well, I kid, but don't kid yourself that this movie is anything like worth 2 hours of your time. ** from me on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a boy/girl movie and nothing more, you will find it here but will be missing the greatest part of this movie. The choices of songs and so wonderfully performed by all the principles left me breathless.  I wasn't able to take my eyes off the screen because I was so fascinated by the set design, photography, colors, costumes --- I really am running out words to describe how overwhelmed I was by this movie, and I see about two movies a week. This was worth all the exposure to lesser films this year. I am really amazed that I am going so overboard in my praise because it really is not my nature. The last time I was even nearly so impressed was the drama of "Boys don't Cry". This, of course, is very different moviemaking. You must, however, avoid bringing critical notice of some details. It is a fantasy nor reality and must be absorbed as such. Go see it in the best sound theatre available. You will miss much if you don't see it with full surround, best fidelity and a large screen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie blew me away!! Nicole Kidman proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that she's going to do just fine without Tom. Her portrayal of Satine is quite simply incredible. Ewan McGregor also turns in an incredible performance. Although I've been a fan of his for quite some time, this movie should show the whole world how good he is. The camera work, effects, supporting cast (John Leguizamo in particular), and the amazing soundtrack are also superb. Baz Luhrmann proves once again he is one of the best directors around. This movie deserves many, many, many awards. Now I have to go. I'm going to see it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bloody talent of a film. This film went over so well with our audience that at the end there was complete silence as if in respect and appreciation for the film, out of 300 or so people only a handful left before the credits were over. And when the credits finished a huge cheer arose. It was like nothing I've ever experienced at the movies. I walked straight out of the movie and bought the cd, its fantastic! I'm listening to Valeria's track 5 right now it's awesome!I might be biased cos I'm an Aussie but this has been the best film I Have seen in years. A great visual stimulation, my friend called the first 40 minutes a full body assault that attacked all the senses, you certainly can't sleep thru it! And thru-out the film there are many aussies who put in an appearance which adds a greater excitement for Australian audiences but don't worry there is enough to keep everyone interested in this film.There are some stand out performances from Nicole and Ewan McGregor who carve up the screen with Come What May the shows only original love song. Also Jim Broadbent is a real asset who adds a lot to this film and John Leguizamo who plays Telous the dwarf well without detracting focus from the movies leads!I am so proud that this is an Aussie production and not only is it the best we've produced but I think it'll put its mark on the world and make people stand up and take note at what us Aussies can do!I highly recommend this film, its a simulation ride thru time with amazing sets, costumes and acting talent. 5 stars go and see it at the cinemas your a fool if u don't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow...that's all I can muster up right now. That movie was...wow...so many things. It was beautiful, colorful, vibrant, astounding, hilarious, mind-boggling, sad, and joyous. The range of emotions that streaked across me was incredible: I went from laughing my heart out to biting my nails in anticipation. I went from screaming in agony on the inside to giggling hysterically. That is a very powerful feeling, and one which the exceptional director Baz Luhurmann played upon us wonderfully well. The movie was extraordinary, I thought.

That is the first time I've ever cried in a movie (except for a LONG time ago when I saw The Bear, but that doesn't count...). Major kudos to Ewan McGregor, whom I didn't realize had the emotional intensity to play such an in-depth character, and Nicole Kidman, whom I formerly despised but now adore because of her incredible range and raw talent. Their performances left me shocked, scarred, above all else...pleased. "Moulin Rouge" is a movie I would love to buy, see again and again, and discuss. That is the truth, filled with beauty, and it sets me free...so much that it makes me fall in love with the essence of the film all over again....:)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann has taken the formula of classic musicals from a bygone era and injected them with a HUGE shot of adrenalin (or absinthe) to bring us "Moulin Rouge". And what a cinematic experience! There's lots of color, noise and movement that is almost too much to take at times, and it will leave you gasping for breath. I could go on and on here, but I won't. My advice is just to go and see it and judge for yourself. You won't be disappointed. Baz and 20th Century Fox should now be negotiating "Moulin Rouge 2".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading the many comments already posted, I'm not sure what I can add, except I Love This Movie!! Not since "Titanic" has a movie gotten me this excited!! Even though they are very different movies, they have the same "feel" to them, i.e the long lines of people waiting to get in; the heart-wrenching love story; audiences clapping throughout and at the end; at least half the theater sitting through all the credits. I've seen it twice and will definitely see it at least a few more times.There is so much visually to take in that it is impossible to catch everything in one showing. Baz Luhrman did a remarkable job. I really enjoyed his version of Romeo &amp; Juliet, but this even surpasses that!Nicole Kidman &amp; Ewan McGregor were amazing and so good together. And who knew they could sing so well! I agree this movie is probably not for everyone, but even if you are not a "fan" of musicals this will "knock your socks off!" It is a roller coaster ride of emotions &amp; visual &amp; musical stimuli that will leave you breathless - and running back for more!I really hope the "critics" are not too hard on this wonderful movie. Sometimes it seems like they feel it it their job to find fault with movies rather than "experience" them. This is one movie that is definitely an Experience!!Please, go see it and you will not be disappointed. It is definitely a 10/10!!</fullReview>

Throw in some admittedly very good music and dancing, albeit shamelessly over-produced and over-acted, and you have Moulin Rouge, version 2001.The best bit was the CG graphic of the Paris roofscape in 1900. Should have been more of that. Moulin Rouge 2 anyone? Nah, have to wash what's left of my hair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the most amazing films I have ever seen! A feast for the ears and eyes. I am trying to coerce the world into seeing this film! Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman prove that they can SING! Often called a cross between "Rocky Horror Picture Show" and "Titanic," it is really true. Destined to be a cult classic. So few films can successfully pull off such a sharp shift in tone. The first 45 minutes or so is a complete farce, high camp. Then it slowly down shifts until the end is deep tragedy. And yet it works. The music, the costumes, the performances, the story, the script, the visuals... it all works!! It is almost like seeing a theatrical production. The film opens and closes with the opening and falling of a stage curtain, and some musical numbers are so elaborately staged that everytime I have seen it (three so far) the audience bursts into applause!A MUST SEE!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a little hesistant at first about going to see this show. I found Strictly Ballroom to be fun. And have not seen R&amp;J simply because the actors do nothing for me in it. But about three weeks ago, one drizzly afternoon in a local store I saw the CD and decided to have a listen. In todays society of croakers being passed off as crooners I was interested to see what sort of sound Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman would have. I walked out of the store with two things. One a copy of the CD and two a firm commitment to see the film when it was released two weeks later.Moulin Rouge is banquet, a gargantuan feast of sight and sound. It screams Baz Luhrman, but's that's ok - it's his trademark. Baz has assembled a cast that suits perfectly. I didn't feel that there was one person who shouldn't have been there (however it was a bit of a shock to see "Diver Dan" in drag - Aussie readers will understand).As a self confessed Musicals freak, I had a predilection towards this film as I walked in. The numbers are fantastic with ny hat going off to the "Roxanne" number, it reminded me very much of the three way song that The Phantom, Christine and Raoul do at the end of Phantom of the Opera. I had an idea that Ewan could sing from Velvet Goldmine and Emma, but Baz has helped to fully develop a wonderful voice and set it free. Nicole Kidman said that Ewan and herself have made a pact that they are not singing in pubs, clubs, parties, or generally in public though. The one exception I hope they make is if the song is nominated for an Oscar.Well done to all involved, if this was a stage play it would be up there with the great stories like Les Mis, Phantom or West Side Story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is too much in this movie to comment on. It is fast-paced and breath-taking. It is beautiful and romantic. It is lush and decadent. Its is poignant and human. It is absurd and bizarre. It will affect your very core. This film is part Broadway Musical, part Opera, part Music Video. Had someone explained it to me in those terms, I would not have gone. But I can assure you, as a fan of Opera rather than MTV, that the elements WORK! Ewan McGregor is a rock star waiting to be. Nicole Kidman is beautiful, powerful, and a very nice singer. The supporting cast is amazing. There are so many wonderful costumes, sets, lights, colors, camera tricks, songs, musical manipulations, dances, and best of all, it all blends together into a WONDERFUL story! (reminiscent most of Dumas' "Camille", with even a reference to Camille's most famous portrayer, Sarah Bernhardt). It is nearly overwhelming at times, and it is so simple at times. Every element is blended together seamlessly to create a completely new form of the movie-musical. I would like to go into specifics, but I will exceed the 1,000 word limit far too quickly. I think anyone who enjoys love stories, musicals, operas, dance, or just a good film will appreciate this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth, beauty, freedom, love - all in a day's work for Moulin Rouge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably a biased review, given that I have long been a fan of Baz Luhrmann's works. His envelope pushing has, what I think is, an Australian freshness about it - which is perhaps why it has received mixed reviews. The story is simple Christian (Ewan McGregor) has come to Paris, to Montmartre (the bohemian capital of France), to seek out freedom, truth, beauty and love. He enters the infamous nightclub the Moulin Rouge where he's instantly smitten by the courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman). She mistakes him for the Duke (the fabulous Richard Roxburgh in a brilliantly slimy role) who she's meant to seduce for money for a new play Christian is writing. But just like so many musical comedies the mistake strikes sparks of romance. Excellent cameo roles from Australian musical icons - Kylie Minogue, Christine Anu, Jackson Mendoza, Caroline O'Connor as well as well rounded performances from Jim Broadbent, John Leguizamo, David Wenham, Gary McDonald and Jacek Koman as a narcaleptic Argentinian.This is a complete rollercoaster ride - you run the gamut of emotions and with typical Baz style there's oodles of humour in it. It's glitzzy glamourous, fast moving, funny, sad and entirely well worth the almost 2 wait for it to come to the screens. The music, also, is extraordinary. From Elton John, to Marilyn Munroe, to Madonna, U2, Moby, Sting - together with a brilliant score.By the way - it's worth staying to the end of the credits for a small reminder of what the film is about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never in 28 years as a movie-goer have I heard a packed cinema stand and clap at the end of a film. What a feeling this movie generates, a visually spectacular (spectacular!) experience with a beautiful story line and a love to last the ages. The use of modern day songs and lyrics kept the audience amused and at the edge of their seat to see what song they could recognise next. And who knew that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman could sing? These were the words whispered while filing out of the cinema by hundreds of movie goers through their now subsiding tears. The whole cast surely surprised and mesmerised alot of people with their seemingly unlimited talent but none more-so than Nicole and Ewan. This movie was beautiful in every way and I would strongly recommend it to all ages. I loved this film and believe if the promotion of it is right it may become of Sound of Music notoriety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am in love with "Moulin Rouge"!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am in love with a movie, and that movie is "Moulin Rouge." This occurrence happens maybe once or twice in a decade, if one is lucky: a movie comes along that so dazzles, excites, and shakes up your notions of what a movie should be, so exceeds and surpasses your expectations as to leave you completely dazed and dazzled. For me "Moulin Rouge" was all that and more. Firstly, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor were absolutely brilliant. Their performances were two of the most human, beautiful creations I have ever seen any actors create. Secondly, the visual design was the most sumptuous, eye-popping, fantastical one I have ever seen. The colors were so bright and awe-inspiring that it seemed to be one, long, beautiful dream. And some of the special effects were so unexpected and delightful that I will never forget them. Thirdly, the score was absolutely brilliant. Blending songs that are classic standards, such as Rodgers and Hammerstein, with modern pop songs written by the likes of the Beatles, Madonna, Elton John, and even Nirvana, and then reworking these songs into operatic-sounding pieces of musical theatre, Baz Luhrmann, the director, has finally accomplished what we have been waiting all too long for: the first great post-modern musical. Recent attempts, such as "Dancer in the Dark," have tried but failed to accomplish this, because they did not have their full heart in the musical aspect of the piece. "Dancer in the Dark," for example, had only 6 or 7 songs, most of which were quite short. In contrast, "Moulin Rouge" blends at least 30 songs in its mammoth, brilliant score. Most amazingly, all of the songs fit perfectly, despite their varied sources, and the lyrics are so perfect you would think they were written for these characters. The musical numbers themselves are so fantastically staged and choreographed that the audience in the Ziegfeld Theatre in NYC, where I saw it, spontaneously burst into applause at the close of almost every one, as if it was live theatre. That is I believe the greatest testament to the power of this film. It made people laugh, it made people cry, it made people, most of whom did not seem to be fans of musical theatre, sing. The movie got an honest to God standing ovation at the end, much like I heard happened at Cannes. When the actors names appeared at the end, people cheered, as they did when the director's name came up. Do yourself a favor, and throw all your preconceptions of this film out the window. Whether you are a fan of musical theatre or not, I can almost guarantee you will, if not fall madly in love with this movie as I have, have an experience the likes of which you have never had before. And that is saying a lot for an age when completely original films are so few and far between. Yes, "Moulin Rouge" copies cliches from many different mythic and musical sources, but it does so only to deconstruct them, turn them on their head, and create one of the most satisfying cinematic worlds I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Mixture of 19th and 21st Centuries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most disappointed. This film does not measure up at all against its 1952 version starring Jose Ferrer as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Zsa Zsa Gabor. Trying to mix the 19th Century with the 21st Century is like mixing oil and water. The 19th Century music in the original film was far more interesting than the music in the 2001 film. The plot seemed contrived just as opera plots are contrived to make the music fit in. It was an attempt to immitate the 1930's-1950's musicals which often did not make sense and were boring in their own way. This as boring, not in the same class as South Pacific, Carousel, and Show Boat. One reason is that Nicole Kidman, really miscast in her role, is not the caliber of singer that starred in the great musicals. Her singing was better than most actresses but the great musicals used great singers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Topsy-Turvy with Nicole on Acid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was at loss for words concluding this picture, but now that I'm composed I feel Alive. Moulin Rouge did not feel like a movie, it felt like watching a live performance on Broadway. This was Topsy-Turvy with Nicole on acid, she's Satine a woman of the night torn between Christian, a poor writer and a Duke. The love story is as simple as Killer's Kiss, but its comic-dance scenes are as great as Everyone Says I Love You. McGregor belts out tunes with talented confidence, complimented by Nicole singing like a love-bird, she moves you and you stare at her in disbelief as she furiously dances, participating in the Moulin Rouge. The audience applauded at her with passion at the end of a hectic scene where she's talking to the Duke, hiding Christian in her room. There are many magickal sequences that will be remembered, as stamps of the cinema standing the test of time, simple scenes powerful and eloquent. A french man singing Roxanne with a thick voice, while the director like a panther moves from two simultaneous actions of Satine with the Duke, being forcefully cornered to a Roxanne tango, while Christian walks the streets of 1900 Paris, singing the song in a different place. If this was on Broadway, receipts for The Producers would be cut in half, what a show, what a show I tell you, a rare gem you will see again &amp; again &amp; again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Baz tops himself again. The film is sure to be reviled since it's so vital, cinematic, and groundbreaking. It will take some critics and some audience members years to catch up. Baz Luhrmann and his fearlessly committed team -particular honors go to the costumes, production design, cinematography- have fashioned a film that's unlike any other (high praise!) and that deserves all the scattered raves it will also be reaping. And then of course there's the music. It's a dazzling and sometimes left field approach to a song score and it works so well... Total highlights? Jim Broadbent's hilarious "Like A Virgin", the "Come What May" Bollywood finale, and "the Tango Roxanne." I hope that moviegoers will open up their minds and hearts to this. We desperately need films that challenge us visually and aurally. We need films that arrive in messy confusing 'I-don't-know-quite-what-to-make-of-this' glory. The same old same old will kill the art form. I saw this movie last night and I'm ready to go again this morning. To quote the plug/plea of the sales pitch within the film "SPECTACULAR! SPECTACULAR!"</fullReview>

People are accusing this of being excess. Of course it is! It's up to you whether or not you can survive an assault on your senses, because if you do, you will be in for quite a treat.Never have I been so knocked out by a movie. To say this movie throws in everything and the kitchen sink is the understatement of the year. Come what may, this is a wonderful example of the experimental nature of cinema, and if you can't take it, then maybe this movie isn't for you. But this movie is for me, and it's exhilirating.

		<shortDescription>The Sparkling Diamond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Moulin Rouge" (2001) starts out in Paris with Christian (Ewan McGregor), a young writer who has just come from London, England. The writer begins to type his story, his story of love, jealousy, and betrayal, and how he learned the most important thing in life to learn, "just to love, and be loved in return". He begins with end; the woman he loves is dead. It all started a year before, when he first arrived in Paris, France. He rents a room in a hotel and after getting situated, has an unconscious Argentinian (Jacek Koman) fall through his ceiling. He is introduced to the Moulin Rouge through Toulouse (John Leguizamo) and thus begins the story. The love of his life is Satine (Nicole Kidman), the young and very beautiful star courtesan of the night club, Moulin Rouge. He is introduced to her through Toulouse and through a misunderstanding of him being a Count, becomes involved with the Moulin Rouge indefinitely.The film's central idea seems to be that love is the most important thing in life, and the most important lesson to be learned is to love and be loved in return. He does very well at trying to convey that message, and even begins the movie with such. He stresses how important the lesson is, but does well to include comedic areas in Moulin Rouge to not make the whole movie seem so oppressive and heavy. It is a great story about truth, beauty, freedom, and above all else, love.The whole movie is utterly amazing and appealing, and I highly applaud the director, Baz Luhrmann. Although the cinematography could use some help in spots, such as the scene on top of the elephant, the rest of the cinematography was very enjoyable to watch. The characters are realistic and believable, as if they could exist during the time period and area. The colors are dark to convey the dark plot and being about a very seedy nightclub of the film. It's a musical, and the music chosen for this film were perfect choices for this film, especially since all of the music was mostly modern. Altogether, the film was fantastic, and I would recommend anyone who enjoys a good love story or musical to watch this film and enjoy the dark playground that is Moulin Rouge.</fullReview>

Personally musicals aren't my favorite but this is an absolute masterpiece of a movie. I was engulfed by the emotion, music, and cinematography of this piece. The storyline is incredible and actors Ewan and Nicole deliver. An absolute must see date movie or at home. Be ready to laugh, be ready to cry, be ready to be angry, bottom line is get your movie going machine prepared for a roller coaster of a ride.

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary, spectacular musical!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge (2011), directed by Baz Luhrmann is an extraordinary musical that takes stunning and daring risks with actors, song choice, costuming, choreography and plot. It is perhaps one of the best, if not the best, musicals I've ever watched in the sense that the execution of the story is both breathtaking and entertaining. Luhrmann chose to use actors like Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor as his star roles which made his choice of actors seemed quite daring at the time to the public. However, the highly talented and capable duo made the film's zest far more alluring and impressive. Luhrmann's use of type casting also helped to make the plot far more realistic to viewers.The best thing that comes out of "Moulin Rouge!" is definitely it's music and performances. The plot allows the movie to continue rolling along, however it's soundtrack allows the audience to feel the immense excitement and enthusiasm radiating from the screen. The performances are powerful and intensifying. Aside from excitement, the movie creates a feel of fantasy, love and aspirations while still reflecting reality. The musicality of the performances were intensified by it's highly decorated sets and costuming. There are bursts of color and light highlighted in every scene, that emanate specific emotions to be felt among the audience.The film is a great example of dramatic love, that reflects some of the concepts produced by films like "Romeo and Juliet". It's Bohemiam and burlesque-like twist emphasizes the overall sexiness and passionate love from the characters and allows the viewers to be totally immersed into the musical. "Moulin Rouge!" is an experience that is surely a shame to miss out on!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I understand that some people simply won't "get" "Moulin Rouge" as it is the definition of a marmite film. You will either completely hate everything about it or absolutely love it and watch it all the time. Unfortunately for me I'm the latter half, I love "Moulin Rouge" and although slightly flawed, I still have to give a complete 10 out of 10 just simply for its uniqueness and watch-ability factor. Heres more reasons why I love it.The story itself is very simple and text-book for a romantic musical. It's very similar to Baz's version of "Romeo + Juliet" because it's about forbidden love. However believe or not, "Moulin Rouge" has even more style and is 10x more outrageous and fun! What it lacks in complexity it gains in sheer originality. The first thing that will strike anyone is the incredible visuals that Baz puts in from the very start. It looks absolutely amazing and is a masterclass in how to use sight and sound. The cinematography is really top-notch and awe-inspiring. this is why blu-ray was invented!Baz's directing is outstanding! The first 20 minutes or so are incredibly fast-paced and may put some people off, but it's important to keep with it because it does slow down a little. Everything is completely put on top gear and it's brilliant! The way the film uses modern day songs for a late 1800's style setting is pure genius, and you just get really into the songs and the music. "Moulin Rouge" could be described as one long music video which may put some people off. But not me! The film is also really funny as well and uses slapstick cartoonish humour to motor along lovely. Richard Roxborough (not sure how to spell it) as The Duke was a delight, his rendition of Madonna's "Like a Virgin" has me in stitches every time! Jim Broadbeny as "Ziddler" also impresses and goes brilliantly with the over the top style of the film. Let's make this clear that no one can actually sing. Ewan thinks he can get away with just shouting all the time and Nicole can't hit the high notes and usually gets away with it by fainting just before she hits them. But even so, you will find your spine tingling with the incredible music that bellows on the screen.The final scene is really inventive and always gives me chills. "Moulin Rouge" will make you laugh and possibly make you cry (I didn't because I'm a big boy!) What's certain is that you will be singing along to all your favourite songs (even if it is in your head). "Moulin Rouge" is best enjoyed with the sound cranked all the way up and probably best seen in blu-ray quality. Just open up your mind and enjoy the incredible visuals, directing and sound. If you watch it for the first time, there's a very strong chance that you will watch it at least 5 more times!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Rouge - a musical with a few magical touches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is a classic story of love-at-first-sight, with the twist of the hopeless romantic falling for a prostitute. I know we all claim to be tired of this sort of thing... but just stop whining and enjoy its charms. Please? For me? This film is complex enough to make that overdone plot line incredibly rich and fantastic. Christian is a writer who has come to Paris to experience the bohemian revolution, with a dedication to the ideals of "truth, beauty, freedom and, above all things, love". He falls in love with Satine, the Moulin Rouge's head starlette. The intriguing part of this story is what happens when Christian is mistaken for the Duke, an investor in the Moulin Rouge's production of Spectacular Spectacular, a play Christian is writing for a bunch of crazy bohemians. Satine wants to go from "courtesan" (or the hooker with the prettiest singing voice) to actress, and the Moulin Rouge will subsequently transform from "night club" (or glorified brothel) to theatre. But they need the Duke's money. He is creepily obsessed with Satine and demands that she... service... only him, in exchange for his funding. To make matters worse, he demands that the deeds to the Moulin Rouge be transfered to him in the case that there be any "funny business", which of course there is, because she is giving Christian free "service" behind the Duke's back.What's so good about Moulin Rouge? Well, to hook the classic rock lovers, it has showy covers of some really great hits - Your Song by Elton John, Heroes by David Bowie, Silly Love Songs by Paul McCartney, Roxanne by The Police, All You Need is Love by The Beatles, and The Show Must Go On by Queen. Also, Madonna, Nirvana, and Whitney Houston. So mostly great rock songs, but there is something for everyone. And who can forget Christina Aguilera with... OK I forget who... doing Lady Marmelade?The art direction in Moulin Rouge is fabulous... and weird. Very weird. It might take a second watch to really get into the weird comedy as well. Have a few drinks with your first watch and you'll soon find yourself chuckling at the absurd circumstances and nonsensical spectacles. Just trust me.Partway through there is a noticeable shift from ridiculous dance scenes to dramatic, tense ballads. Accompanying the shift in tone is Christian's transition from boy falling in puppy love to insanely jealous lover. Ewan McGreggor does a spectacular job here. Watch how long his goofy grin is plastered on that face, making him the picture of a man falling in love for the first time (don't you know it's gonna last) and then suddenly he is intense and crazed. Flashes of that innocent love can be seen in his expression later, making the transition incredibly flushed out and believable.You're really going to have to take a leap of faith with me if you haven't seen this. The first watch may even be too estranging, but just stay seated for the whole ride, and I promise you will like where you end up. Just... just trust me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a color-drenched, frantically directed, near-operatic song and dance fest laced with special effects. The plot is thoroughly trounced in the trappings, but it involves handsome songwriter Ewan McGregor (as Christian) falling in love with leggy Nicole Kidman (as Satine), a "Cabaret" singer with a "Camille" complex. Yes, Ms. Kidman mixes up Liza Minnelli with Greta Garbo. It's set in Paris at the turn of the century (1899/1900), but the soundtrack finds most of its songs in the second half of the 1900s.The justification for the inclusion of "future" songs may be found in the lyric "songs they have sung for a thousand years" from "The Sound of Music". "Nature Boy" is the most important tune, making Mr. McGregor's "enchanted" character believable. The Beatles' publishing companies were only mildly forthcoming, but Madonna was generous. Elton John's "Your Song" is also featured prominently. And, McGregor sings it well. The extravagant DVD package smells nice. But, the film's taste is strictly acquired.***** Moulin Rouge!

		<fullReview>I think this film is absolutely annoying. Why are we living in an age where every wannabe-actor is suddenly a great singer and performer. So far until date, Nicole Kidman's only good performances has been exposing her body either naked or in tight or see-through costumes (in her youth) on camera and Ewan McGregor is a very handsome man but not a deep feeling character actor. Good for Star-Wars, The Island and other action packed no-brainers.So, in this movie you are not seeing the young, hot Nicole and you are forced to witness Ewan as a deep wanna-be bourgeois poet-type which comes out rather annoying.They have taken hits from the last 20-30 years and over-stuffed the movie with them for the hope of recognition appeal, however, hearing every song from my youth spoiled by never-ending sustains in a less-then-flattering 'opera-style' just made me feel more and more annoyed.The plot of the movie would last around 5 minutes if they didn't have the lingering tones (forever) to make the 2 hours.I like being reminded of older songs in a modern way, but I would rather hear Christina Aguilera sing 'Lady Marmalade' 10 times than watch this movie again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge! never concerns itself with reality, possibility, or the common things of life. No, this is a film that shatters all preconceived notions of what a movie looks like and embraces the bizarre and the beautiful with arms wide open. Director Baz Luhrmann has created something utterly unique, a movie the likes of which I doubt I will ever see again.The Moulin Rouge! is a risqué cabaret in the Underworld of Paris in the early twentieth century. When a young and naive poet comes to the show in hopes of writing it's very first real production, he falls in love with the cabaret's star, Satine. On the very same night, a rich duke who is considering financing the club to turn into a respectable theater is basing his decision on the charms and devotion of Satine. All is played out to dramatic and exuberant musical numbers.Luhrmann directs his cast to perfection, with Nicole Kidman delivering one of her best (and Oscar-nominated) performances. Ewan McGregor, Richard Roxburgh, John Leguizamo, and particularly Jim Broadbent all deliver wonderfully charismatic performances as well. And the music!!! Using groundbreaking compilations of modern pop songs reworked as musical numbers, the soundtrack is simply enthralling from the very first moment. In the areas of costumes, makeup, and art direction, the film is monumental.There is a strange feeling of both energy and exhaustion that overtakes you as Moulin Rouge! comes to a close. It's a feeling that is rare not only with films, but with life in general. It is the feeling you get when you realize you have seen a masterpiece, and it is the feeling you will no doubt have when you witness Moulin Rouge! 9/10 stars!!! Jay Addison</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Early in 2001, Australian auteur Baz Luhrmann followed up his modern adaptation of Romeo &amp; Juliet with an even greater cinematic accomplishment. Moulin Rouge is set at the end of the 19th Century in 1899 (the 'summer of love'). The writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) sits at his typewriter in a grungy Paris loft, typing out the story of the life and death of his love Satine (Nicole Kidman). Thus from the very beginning we pretty well know where the story is going but how we get there is really something else.Moulin Rouge is what's known as a 'jukebox musical.' It takes a selection of well-known popular songs and alters them (musically and lyrically) just enough to fit the story as needed. In this film, the purpose of this is two-fold. First the pop-songs communicate the foreign and dated culture that is portrayed in a way that the audience can understand. In the early dance hall scenes, we hear not gaudy horns, but the songs of Madonna, Nirvana and Patti Labelle, among others - the idea being that our reaction to them should be similar what the Frenchmen would have felt upon hearing the dance hall music of THEIR time. Second, the protagonist Christian is established as an incredible poet, as he has the ability to instantly spin off the greatest poetry of the 20th Century (in a time before it was ever actually written, of course). Thus he helps the dwarf Toulouse-Lautrec and a narcoleptic Argentinean write their modern Bohemian play 'Spectacular Spectacular' and then, at the Moulin Rouge, woos Satine with his rendition of Elton John's 'Your Song.' However, Satine has been promised to an evil English Duke, in exchange for funding for the Moulin Rouge. The Duke catches Satine with Christian, but they swiftly explain that they are rehearsing a play, the plot of which exactly mirrors what is going on in their own lives.Which of the two Satine ends up with should come as no surprise. This is a film whose strength lies in style, not in unusual plot twists. The imagery is dazzling and often surreal; the music is densely layered and incredibly well harmonized. At times we hear up to four different pop-songs being played at once. The pace of the musical scenes is breakneck and there is likely more cutting than in any GOOD movie ever made. The film is also unapologetically silly at times, featuring cartoon-like motions and sound effects.Admittedly, the ending is kind of a downer. Not only is Satine dead of tuberculosis, as we have known from the beginning, but we are left with the impression that the time of those oft-mentioned Bohemian ideals of Freedom, Beauty, Truth and Love will soon be swept aside by the tides of war. In fact, one early version of the script had Christian telling his story, not from his typewriter, but while dying in the Fields of Flanders. That would have really been too much and was wisely changed.For outstanding (and Oscar-winning) costumes and art direction, a great ensemble performance and sheer frenetic energy, Mouling Rouge makes my top 10 list.</fullReview>

The Year of 2001 is one of this golden years, which are coming sometimes to remind us for the greatest time of cinema, in this year was born "Harry Potter", in the same period was born and "The Lord of the Rings", "Beautiful Mind" too. It was one of the best years in the history of cinema. After this movie I'm feeling very sophisticated and feel how my hearth beat with power which we, peoples said "Love".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazingly dazzling and mesmerizing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The subject is banal : Paris, 1900, the famous Moulin Rouge music-hall and their never-ending shows that are titillating and mysterious, fascinating and prodigious. Love above everything else, romantic love with its passion, the little thing deep down inside, dramatic love of course, melodramatic even. The actress of such a show is supposed to finance the show, and the work of everyone else, by providing the patrons, the generous financiers with some carnal pleasure, illusionary or real according to the desires and potencies of these rich even if rather aging males. The melodrama is reached when the actress is dying of consumption. The red of blood is mixing with the green of absinthe. But that is without taking into account Nicole Kidman who transforms that baroque and rococo tall tale of love and prostitution into what it is supposed to be, a blinding explosion of colors and fire, lights and flames. And she can keep the tears on the stage exclusively and prevent the audience from watering the succulent plants in the lobby of the movie theater. Then we are dazed by the brilliant dances, the mesmerizing music, the fascinating songs, the nostalgically innovative melodies, the special effects that are exploding everywhere and transforming a plain stage or a plain screen into some kind of cosmic big bang on the retinas of our eyes, not to speak of the eardrums of our ears. More brilliant than that you die. And Nicole Kidman, or Satine if you prefer, can die on the stage in the arms of her beloved author who is crying so much and so loud that we do not even need to do the same. And then the whole world can fall apart and we can jump into an elliptic flash forward and projects our asses from the flash back of the recollection back into the future when this Christian is reminiscing the thunderous passion of theirs and the flashes of craziness that went along with it. Thanks God this is already a classic for the next generation.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie-going experience of my life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellence in crassness, in vapidity, in editing that destroys what were apparently quite good dance sequences ... Yes, I voted it as excellent in the hope that this comment wouldn't be down on the tenth page where all the no star reviews are stored. This film is the most nauseous mess I have ever seen. Migraine inducing visuals, absurd musical choices, actors chewing the scenery while singing hammed-up versions of "The Sound of Music".Now, to be fair, I've never seen the film in its entirety, but I have tried to see it through three times to understand why some people love it ... and failed ... I can't make it to the end. The noisy, garish, tasteless assault defeats me every time. The only successful performance in the film is by Nicole Kidman's porcelain epidermis. Dancers of the calibre of Caroline O'Connor must have been furious at the way their performances were hatcheted.There was a movie in there somewhere Baz, but you couldn't find it, so you drowned it in treacle. Lovers of this film are masochists or boneheads.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely wonderful and majestic film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies of all time since it's original and full of excitements and those gorgeous scenery backdrops of vintage Paris and famous sites (like the Moulin Rouge) is just WOW! The visuals of the movie were really magical and very theatrical and mind blowing. The men and women (especially the lovely Nicole Kidman) have amazing costume designs and I can't really explain how I feel about the whole movie because it is just breathtaking to watch. I've never felt excited to see movies that much until I started watching a trailer for the movie and it had great strong dynamic performances and visuals were I felt I will actually feel like I am anticipating for a movie release which is rarely. The plot was pure genius and had great depth to story telling and the lead actors Ewan and Nicole were truly top notch and their chemistry makes everyone fall in love even more. All of the musical scores and songs sung by the actors were brilliantly done and I would recommend people who have not watched the movie to SEE IT! It is the most amazing thing you will see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not only visually stunning, it has an amazingly, beautiful and touching story. It tells the story of a young, naive writer named Christian (McGregor) who comes to Paris to try and start his career. After making friends with some rather scrupulous characters, including famed absinthe soaked artist Toulouse-Lautrec(Leguizamo), he gets into a fiasco involving a bordello, its owner(Broadbent), its star performer(Kidman), and a Duke(Roxburgh) who is to invest in an upcoming show. The film then takes the viewer on a whirlwind journey through romance, comedy and tragedy. This is a truly breathtaking film full of exciting musical numbers and superb acting from the whole cast. An easy 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's Quite Modern but if your open i think you might enjoy it"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge!, directed by Baz Luhrmann who most of you will know from the modern take on Romeo + Juliet. If You have seen Romeo + Juliet than you have most likely already decided that you like his style or not.As with Romeo + Juliet, i adore Moulin Rouge. From its wacky beginning to its spine tingling and heartbreaking final act. The songs are magnificent, using modern lyrics and incorporating them into excellent songs was a great idea. The acting is superb with amazing performances from Nicole Kidman and Ewan McCregor who, not only played their parts to perfection but sung in all their roles and did it amazingly well. I love everything about Moulin Rouge, every song, every scene and every line. For me there is absolutely no faults at all in this modern Masterpiece.One thing is for certain, you will either love it or hate it. For some people i appreciate it just might not be your type of movie but if you give it a chance and love it like i did then you will witness one of the most groundbreaking modern masterpieces in recent history that i'm sure you will watch and re-watch over and over again.As for the co-stars, John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh are all excellent in their roles. This movie is amazing and one not to be missed for its audience pleasing style,its amazing set design,costumes and songs, its excellent acting and storytelling and it's utter difference from anything you might have seen previously.10/10- Amazing,beautiful,heart-breaking, one of the best movies i have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A luxurious movie. The beginning of the movie is hysterical, weird, sexy and it gracefully transcends into true love and drama. Throughout the film, there is the apparent theme of beauty - the scenes and sets are lush and luxurious, the leading actor and actress are handsome and beautiful as opposed to the "circus freaks" who populated Moulin Rouge, the music is made up of remixed songs but it captivates you to a world of fantasy and love. The acting is superb as the sensual Nicole Kidman (satine)allures you into loving her. She plays a strong character who eventually gives into love. Ewan McGregor (Christian) voice will make you fall in love with him. He plays a romantic character whose gentle passion turns to strong fierce raging love. There is tenderness through his voice and eyes which will make every woman sigh longing for a man just as romantic as he is. He truly deserved the Golden Globe. John Leguizamo is just excellent - comedic and sweet. He gave his legs for this performance and should be recognized for it. Jim Broadbent is perfect - he plays a father like figure to Satine who believes her love affair with Christian is nothing until he discovers that they truly love each other. Richard Roxburgh plays a static character so it's not a difficult character to play but Richard pulls it off wonderfully. This movie will break your heart and make you sing and make you laugh. It makes you want to fall in love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, Glorious Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Moulin Rouge! at the movie theater, I was shocked, surprised and stunned by the most most original cinematology I had ever seen. Its difficult to explain the visual feast for the eyes created by Baz Luhrman in this masterpiece. Suffice to say, no one had ever seen anything like it before. But to dwell only on the visual aspect of this movie does a grave disservice because it is not only a visual marvel but also a superb film in its own right. I have never been a huge fan of traditional musicals such as "Oklahoma" or "Sound of Music". However, Moulin Rouge! completely explodes and re-invents musical film-making. With all deference to the subsequently released "Chicago", Moulin Rouge! is in a league of its own. The melange of pop songs in the "Elephant Song" could have easily have been a disaster but here, it fits perfectly with the story. I would also be remiss not to mention the performances of Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor. Kidman is a revelation. First, her singing was surprisingly accomplished. But the true stunner was the vulnerability and honesty that comes across in her performance - it was simply breathtaking. MacGregor also shocks with his convincing if unspectacular singing and well as his simple but spot on performance as the young and penniless writer. I see literally dozens if not hundreds of movies a year, both classics and new releases but I only own about ten DVDs and reserve purchases only to the absolute classics like The Godfather Trilogy and "The Maltese Falcon". Yes, one of the privileged few DVDs on my shelf is Moulin Rouge! Enough said!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most amazing, better than The Notebook</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate musicals usually. and i had scene the ending twice before wanting to the whole movie until my neighbor wanted me to watch it. After the first viewing i couldn't stop singing the songs. Amazingly enough i own the movie and watch probably twice a week. If you are looking for a romance movie but is fun and outspoken this is the movie for you. I am actually watching the movie right now. Whats amazing about this movie is that Christian (Ewan McGregor) ruins the movie in the beginning but you forget he's telling the story. You will be amazed at how this movie was put together extremely fast in the beginning and slows down dramatically in the middle so you get lost in this story. I recommend someone doing a sequel because after you see it you don't want it to end. I recommend buying the Soundtracks or you will be depressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know why people love this film. Its not its technical brilliance, its not its throwback to the golden musical age of Hollywood. Its supporting characters extremely poorly written and many of the stylistic experiments don't quite work out. But why then is it worth watching time and time again? Its the closest we can see on a screen this far to true love being shown on screen. Its able to bring out the Bohemian in even the most cynical among us and though as a piece of cinema it may not go down as the greatest work it undeniably is a beautiful artwork of some kind and must be remembered as such so that we don't forget just why we continue to listen to silly love songs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Saddest Movie Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who knew that such a visually and aurally stunning movie would also be the saddest movie of all time? Bahz Luhrmann (Romeo + Juliet) explores and expands his colorful, manic, and at times overwhelming style in Moulin Rouge!, but he also has learned how to create a coherent narrative.Moulin Rouge! tells the story of Christian (McGregor), a young quasi-Bohemian in Paris near the turn of the century. He becomes fascinated with Moulin Rouge!, the club in which streetwalkers become celebrities and the rich and the poor mix in a kind of decadence that the club is now internationally famous for. The object of his affection is Satine (Kidman), the premier attraction of the club. She can only be bought for the highest of prices.Seems like a clichéd plot, doesn't it? Well, any one new to this film will be in for a surprise. The sets are absolutely ravishing, the production and sound design are unparalleled even to this day, and the pure pathos exhibited in this film hits right to core. McGregor and Kidman do their singing on the actual set...none of what is in the final film is prerecorded. It has been polished...but their original work is there. And it is stunning. Who knew the two of them had such huge voices? McGregor especially is an eye-opener here. We knew he could act, but to sing like that? Amazing.The lovers live in bliss for a short time, but like all good things that has to come to an end. Passion, lies, murder...again, more clichés, but it works here because we are so emotionally invested in these characters by the end of the film. The tragedy is so overwhelming at the end that many of the people I've watched this film with were literally sobbing by the conclusion. My eyes weren't dry either. There is something so elemental about how love is portrayed in this film--"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return." And that is the greatest thing we have learned. Then that is shattered, stripped from us in the final moments. The end of this film is so cathartic that it leaves you breathless. Moulin Rouge! is easily the saddest film ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never knew I could love a movie as much as I do Moulin Rouge. Honestly. People like what they like, but I am tired of hearing people say stuff like, "It's so weird." People who have no basis for their comments sound undereducated and closed-minded. Baz Luhrmann is an excellent director because he doesn't care about making generic movies that are not memorable. You can always tell he is the director when you see one of his films and I love that about them. Nicole and Ewan and the rest of the cast are perfect in their roles, too. I absolutely love the music they picked for the movie and that makes it fun to watch. LOVE IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried to get over it and give this film a fair viewing, but after watching it a couple of times, I find myself more outraged than ever at the lack of artistic integrity the thing has. Yes, they knew how to get visual wows and glue together a patchwork plot with the emotional juice leached from the songs they stole, but in the end it's just a really well funded and filmed trip to the karaoke bar.It's not just that they recycled the songs in lieu of a script but they couldn't manage to remain true to the spirit, the lyric, or the tune of those songs, nor did they stick to one era or genre. It just seems to be a wholesale ragbag of anything that can goose the emotions of someone not thinking very hard.</fullReview>

It's full of symbols like those of the free and caged birds, Toulouse's make up, weather changes, verses from well known melodies. It is difficult to compare it with other musicals but I remember another masterpiece My Fair Lady. I was happy to realize that now the actors were not dubbed anymore, a thing that unfortunately happened to Audrey Hepburn. All the actors were magnificent. Beautiful animations! I really love it!

I love the part when Christian do what she ask him for doing it: Tell their story. I also love the songs, they are famous songs mixed with new rhythms and voices. And they fix perfectly with the plot of the film. In my view, every teenager(and adult) has to watch it, it teaches a lot about love, truth and the society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, the music for this movie is absolutely amazing! Buy the soundtrack. The chemistry between Nicole and Ewan in this movie was stunning, and the scenery was unbelievable. The story starts off a little strange, and it's the kind of movie you have to watch twice to get a lot of the little details and innuendos that are hidden in the flashing camera angles and song lyrics. But after the first time you see it, you'll want to see it again and again. The beginning is a little tricky to get at first. You already know the ending before you even get to scene 2. But throughout the movie, you fall in love with all the characters, songs, and the storyline. It's the best love story of all time, and I urge you all to watch it.

		<fullReview>i loved the Moulin rouge it was sad but at the same time funny and Christian sung like an angel (sigh) i just loved it. I never new that Nicole Kidman could sing that well she was really good the songs went really well with her voice. I think she played the part really well especially at the beginning she made a really good "sparkling diamond". i thought that the duke did a really good job i found him quit scary at times. He had really good facial expressions. Christian had a really sweet sort of charm to him and made me feel sort of in way nervous for him but as soon as he started to sing that just slipped away. He gave me goose bumps every time he started singing especially the hills are alive with the sound of music line and the this is mine song. All up i thought it was a fun enjoyable film with a really good story line and the people playing the characters were chosen perfectly.</fullReview>

I bought the soundtrack soon afterward and I listen to it every day. This was one of Nicole's most excellent of movies. I was astonished by the fact that the stars in the movie were the singers as well. Nicole could have started a great beginning to a singing career. I believe Nicole could most definitely have the potential to start a singing career. I would hope that anyone reading this who is a fan of romance movies or even just huge fans of Nicole Kidman themselves, would treat themselves by watching Moulin Rouge!.</fullReview>

Moulin Rouge! is simply brilliant. The film starts off in fun and silliness but then takes a dramatic turn into depth and seriousness. It goes beyond the boundaries that movies normally keep themselves in and is TRULY unlike any other musical ever created! Think movies like Chicago were great? Think again. A new definition of "greatness" is made. Moulin Rouge is utterly creative. In fact, it should have won best picture,great as its competitors were that year.

		<fullReview>I saw some parts of the movie when I was looking to another movie on another channel. So I didn't really know what to think about it. But I saw him through for the first time with some friends after the Easterexams. And I loved it, he is funny, romantic, non-cliché and the songs or just so beautiful. My personal favorites are: Your Song, Elephant Love Medley and Roxanne. I got him yesterday from my Mum and I was so glad.He just so like, when you start, you can't stop watching it. The actors are perfectly casted and Christian (Ewan McGregor) is just so sweet. Really, I can recommend it to everybody, I guarantee that you will love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Rouge is What Artistic Cinematography is All About</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Spectacular, Spectacular", the bohemians in Moulin Rouge couldn't have said it better. It is a film that is equally a classic, a work of art, and a musical. It is also brilliantly made in all its aspects, it is strongly emotional, a celebration of beauty, its soundtrack is nothing less than genius, the performances are truly memorable, and it is visually outstanding. This film is an extraordinary production that can only get better every time one sees it.In Moulin' Rouge the theme and sub-themes of the story are made clear by the characters themselves, "Beauty, Freedom, Truth, and Love", of course with love as the main theme. Christian, played by Ewan McGregor, is obsessed with love even though he has never fallen in love himself, the main plot revolves around his ideals about love. Throughout the movie Satine and Christian fight for love only to prove that it conquers all, as they beautifully play it in the song "Come What May". This is their secret song, and no matter what obstacles their love will be stronger than adversity. The whole film revolves around these ideals of the bohemian revolution, or better said: "the children of the revolution". So many films have been made in honor of love, yet this one stands out because it pays tribute to love with art, music, and consequently passion. It is impossible not to fall in love watching this film even if it is for the thousandth time.The story line of the movie gives allusion to several classics, such as "La Boh?me", "La Traviata", and "Orpheus in the Underworld" (IMDB Trivia), yet it stands out for its originality. Another movie which it alludes to is, a stronger classic than the latter, is "Romeo and Juliette". Even if the audience is as cynical as Satine, Christian and the rest of the bohemians will draw them into romantic bliss.Even though the movie is a Tragedy it is made into greatness by the very basic ideals of the Greek Tragedy: it had to be made with such perfection and beauty that the spectator would walk away with a duality of emotion, both sadness for the heartbreaking outcome of the story and joy for the admiration of what they have just witnessed. What is more, whenever a movie starts with the ending the viewer can foresee that the film will be so great that is doesn't need a shocking ending, the movie's story line is enough.The acting in the movie was also worthy of awe, all five main actors, Ewan McGregor as Christian, Nicole Kidman as Satine, John Leguizamos as Toulouse, Jim Broadbent as Zidler, and Richard Roxburgh as The Duke made an incredible performance, and by performance I mean acting and singing. A couple of these actors had a previous positive reputation for their acting, however their singing will sure cause a shocking impression on the audience. The most memorable performances were those of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, they were so intensely in character that it is very hard to watch the movie objectively without getting absorbed into the sentiment of the film.Nevertheless, even though the singing of the actors was incredible it would have been nothing without the elaborate composition of the songs. All of the songs were covers for the most part yet it was seldom obvious. Most of the songs were individually composed of lyrics of many singers and bands and they were redone to fit the movie. These songs are so perfect for every situation that it would have been easier to compose new lyrics than to gather lines from other composers. Purchasing the soundtrack is almost as worthy of getting the movie itself.In addition, the costumes and the sets were so elaborate that they were as important to the film's success as the actors' performance, the music, and the plot. The movie takes place in Paris; yet it is a fantasy landscape of Paris that almost purposefully looks like a miniature replica, this setting adds to the fantastic world in which the film takes place. All of the inside settings are striking for their elaborateness and artistic quality, they add to the movie's creative, elegant, sexy, and dreamlike spirit.Moulin Rouge can also be described as very bizarre and this may be the reason why it does not appeal to all audiences. One of the main elements that make it so is the way the camera is used. It is not at all used in a conventional way; on the contrary, it goes to extremes so that it makes it unconventional. It is a combination of rapid tracking shots, spinning, coordination with the song (specifically in the song Spectacular Spectacular), and more. Even though the usage of the camera makes the movie very bizarre it is almost essential for its artistic structure.Many aspects such as the acting, singing, setting, costumes, use of color, camera movement, and theme, come together to make this movie into a brilliant work of art. However, as great as it is it does not appeal to everyone; because it is so unconventional it may not arise all of the emotions that it should, it may only cause confusion. Despite its unpopularity in certain groups, it is venerated by others. Moulin Rouge was the first acclaimed musical in this time and was the first of many more to come. It is also one of those movies that will be timeless and will only become better with time. Moulin Rouge can be concisely expressed as having heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was to see Moulin Rouge, I didn't quite know what to expect. Some people had told me that they loved it, but some said it was boring. I couldn't disagree more. After seeing it the first time i was amazed. The music, the actors, the feeling I was left with, it was really wonderful!Ewan McGregor is excellent as the English writer Christian, who comes to Paris to be a part of the bohemian revolution. He is to write a play that are going to be shown at the moulin rouge, a nightclub, ruled over by Harold Zidler, where the rich comes to dance and have fun with the creatures of the underworld. There he meets Satine (Nicole Kidman), a courtesan and a cancan-dancer, who wants to become a real actress. They fall in love, but love between them is impossible. It's a classic love story, told in a new way.This is a movie that makes you both laugh and cry. The many singing and dancing numbers are spectacular, and Kidman and McGregor sings very well (I especially think McGregors voice is fantastic). Also the dancers impresses me much.One of the things that I like so much about this film is the way the use modern songs we all know (Smells like teen spirit,your song and like a virgin, to mention some of them), and makes them fit in to this beautiful story from the beginning of the last century. The cutting are also special, and (according to me) good. And not to mention the costumes, they are incredible.. All in all, watching this movie is a real pleasure, and you should all see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved it and I cried. Most of all because I love love stories like that, where the one of them dies in the end. Very original also but that doesn't matter as long as it's good. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman is excellent performers in the movie and a thing which makes the movie even more better is that it's a musical. Everybody who sing in the film is great singers especially the leading parts Ewan and Nicole. I'm very mad at my self because I didn't watch it in the theaters because a movie is always best when you watch it in the theater. I can highly recommend it so if you're a couple who need to know how love can end if you don't follow you're heart this is the perfect movie!</fullReview>

If you didn't watch the movie yet, don't wait any longer... go, rent it, buy it or something and watch it, because it is worth it. Moulin Rouge is my favorite movie... it's a "must see". I hope you like it. It's Wonderful. I am very sad as I didn't watch it in the "Big-screen", but I have seen it twenty or more times. I can't help myself, I'm always singing the songs that are sang in the movie. Ewan MacGregor and Nicole Kidman are the perfect couple for this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. The theme of the movie is clearly evident when the movie starts with Ewan Mcgregor typing "the greatest thing of all is to love and be loved in return". That line encapsulates all that the movie wants to emphasize and wants the audience to take with them. The breathtaking scenes with multitude of colors add to the vibrant nature of the movie. Nicole Kidman's exceptional acting is simply mind blowing. The themes of love, true love and the joy of loving are prominent and the Nicole-Ewan on-screen pair is perfect. The chemistry between them is just pure magic. This movie is fantabulous. The songs are not the usual time-fillers or anything but are appropriate and apt. Although against the norms of Hollywood, this movie is a beautiful piece showcasing artistic adroitness. A must watch for all who believe in Truth, beauty, freedom and love.</fullReview>

This would top Baz Lurmans best piece, (His most ARTY movie). I cant say I was very happy with Romeo &amp; Juliet, Leonardo did not fit the profile of ROMEO and Claire Danes didn't either.

		<fullReview>The Concept: 'Romeo' meets 'Buckaroo Banzai' meets 'eXistenZ'This is your only spoiler warning...Film is, first and foremost, an art form--no different than paintings, sculpture, music, literature, or theatre. The fact that we abuse film into entertaining us or just telling stories is humiliating. When placed in that context, all film is art that varies in quality. 'Moulin Rouge!' is so rich in detail that it has to be fattening.I wasn't planning on liking this one. Romance/Musicals aren't my forte. However, examining Ang Lee's "Eat Drink" allowed me to rethink my criterion. Granted, most entries in the genres are insipid, appealing to our quest for affections, but some have other intentions. Once you get past the silly little love story, it gets VERY interesting.Consider:--This is a movie about a book about a play with actors existing in various levels of reality.--There is a distinct layering of images, sounds, and thoughts. Compare this to any bare-bones Alan Parker musical where everything exists "onstage", never in relation to the audience.--Very competent editing, better than 'Blackhawk Down'. 'Blackhawk' relied on an audio rhythm. Here the cuts are for visual fluency, it takes exposure to learn this method. Notice how elaborate tracking shots substitute for jump cuts or editing transitions. Watch every little nook and cranny for details and keep your eyes open for the use of color. The sound here wasn't as good as I was expecting, 'Amelie' was 2001's best.--Modern songs (from the Beatles to Madonna) are implemented not as fashion statements. After all, why wasn't Tina Turner's "What's Love Got to Do With It" used? No, the music is also prostituted: cheap and tawdry. Hence 1899 as the "summer of love", 1967 all over again. We even have a supporting cast of Bohemian hippies, probably the most colorful things you will ever see.--Pay attention to the brainstorming/rehearsal scenes for "Spectacular Spectacular", the entire ending is explained. Notice how we accept it as good humor at first, then as "drama" when it's revealed. Clever, huh? Makes the "love" concept all the more disposable.--The battles between the artists and the financiers. Every real artist goes through these stages, frequently degrading their original visions for the sake of commercial appeal.2001 was a good year for film (with 2 Scott films, a Lynch, this, and 'Amelie', how can you lose?) and the advances made then will probably carry us through the rest of the decade. Too bad the Oscars got everything screwed up. If you ignore 'Pearl Harbor', 'Lord of the Rings', and 'Planet of the Apes', it isn't that bad.As for Luhrmann, I'm going to keep an eye on him. His control here is paramount and he has a near-Scott level of attention to detail, but he's still young. Here, in particular, he begins to run out of gas about midway (hence the "dragster"), so I'm holding off on my final judgment on him. Let's see how his "Alexander" comes out.In the meantime, let's see Oliver Stone make a musical. We'd need it after the disaster of 'Chicago'. Now THAT had no interesting layering, just 'Sound of Music' all over again.Final Analysis = = Learn from this...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in 2001 when this film came out, my friend and I found ourselves outside the cinema with a choice; Enigma, that dreary-looking World War II film with Kate Winslet, or this, Moulin Rouge, which I had, after seeing the adverts, already decided was not for me.In the end we chose Moulin Rouge and boy am I glad we did.This is a wonderful film, with stunning sets and costumes, great music, and excellent performances.It tells the story of a young writer who moves to Paris to be part of the Bohemian revolution. Here he falls in love with Satine, a glamorous courtesan who works at the Moulin Rouge. Complications arise when 'The Duke' gains the deeds to the club and demands that Satine be exclusively his.Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are delightful as the two lovers, while Jim Broadbent, Richard Roxburgh and John Leguizamo provide excellent support.Baz Luhrmann is a director of real visual style and flair, delivering a film that is funny and moving in turns.Musically, Moulin Rouge! is innovative and fun, with modern songs placed into the context of turn of the century Paris - standouts are the Tango de Roxanne, and Broadbent and Roxburgh's hilarious version of Like a Virgin, although there's also a song written especially for the film, Come What May, that is beautiful.This film may not be to everyone's taste, but I strongly urge you to give it a chance. And this is coming from someone who was resolved to hate it even before the red curtain had opened.....still haven't seen Enigma.....</fullReview>

The sets, the music, the script, the acting, and, most of all, the direction was flawless.A friend of mine who saw it could not get past the use of contemporary music in the film. Too bad. Besides buttressing an argument that love is timeless (affecting our view of the past and the future), the contemporary songs added much to the film.It has been over a month since I saw Moulin Rouge for the first time, and I still find myself humming its musical arrangements.</fullReview>

The movie was fun, funny, and fairly compelling. But...The bad: I still, to this day, can't understand how Satine fell in love McGregor's character (can't remember his name). It just seemed like, "Oh, I hate you, can't stand you, despise you...(pause) Ok, now I love you." Also, I didn't care for the use of anachronism in this movie, nor did I care for it in Romeo and Juliet.It's a good film to watch once, but that horribly overrated soundtrack and unlikely love of Kidman and McGregor will preclude me from ever watching it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its's a movie than starts fresh but just ends in a recycled mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one first starts watching Moulin Rouge it is easy like the characters of the movie to get swept away in its eye popping visual flair. The Costume, and Art department get a big 2 thumbs up for the work they did on this piece. And the some of the musical sequences were phenominal (i.e. Loved the Can-Can; and both versions of "Diamonds are a Girls best friend", as well as "Roxanne" looked amazing). But other than that i feel that Moulin Rouge had nothing else to offer but a very bad, way over-dramatic storyline. Its a Movie that starts Fresh but just ends in a recycled mess and for the most part everything just came off very cheesy. I think what i really didn't like about it is that it seems like an original piece of work but its not. I hated how most of the songs weren't original but remakes or re-vamped versions of pop hits. Throwing a whole bunch of songs together to make one love song just seemed cheesy to me and silly. In fact thats another good adjective for this movie silly, and too erratic. It kinda felt i was on drugs for most of the film; some wild stimulant for the first 30 minutes and then on some depressants for the second half. Though i couldn't feel anything for any of the characters. I really didn't care if the lovers ended up together at the end, because they had to force this love story down your throat till there was no room for air much less anything else. By the end I was just exhausted of hearing everyone moan and cry. Performances over-all were good but I think Ewan Mcgregor shines brighter than Nicole Kidman does. His wide-eyed enthusiam for art and love was addicting at times, but Nicole seemed to jump from stale to over the top too many times (her performances in The Others and The Hours are better examples of her acting abilitites). Everyone else just seemed (again) silly. Moulin Rouge is not a terrible movie. Its almost worth it to own a copy just to look at the dazzling decor of the film. But having to hear 200 songs about love isn't worth it to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an overlong, tedious, frantic 2-hour video clip that should have been kept at a reasonable length: 4 minutes at most.No doubt: Baz Luhrmann is a genius in the making; his visual mastery of the cinematographic medium is awesome, but, alas, his claustrophobic repetitious conception of this film and jerky editing finally defeat any attempt to enjoy the movie experience.Most of the actors are wasted; particularly John Leguizamo as a gloomy caricature of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. But although the lack of screen chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ewan was excruciating, she must be praised for her fine acting.Instead of squandering away their precious time, movie buffs should rent out John Huston's Moulin Rouge (1953) and George Cukor's Camille (1936) and shouldn't forget to grab some of those wonderful timeless Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly's musicals.However, for those that enjoyed this protracted video clip, the extravagant Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1978) and the kitschy Can't Stop the Music (1980) are musts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I resisted the pressure to see this film because the hype surrounding it was too much and I had a feeling it would disappoint. After it received so much hype before the Oscar's I decided to give in and join the masses to see what all my friends were on about. What spectacular rubbish! The fact that someone other than Marilyn Monroe was singing 'Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend' in a big screen motion picture is more or less sacrilegious. The fact that the over-rated Nicole Kidman was chosen to do it is even more humiliating. While some of the supporting cast put in good performances, Nicole really didn't do much to deserve an Oscar nod for this one. With only one original song, I really don't think this deserves to go down as a musical classic. Come on, even Grease 2 managed to do better in the songwriting department! Costumes and set design were about the only original elements of the whole spectacle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love musicals. I love Nicole Kidman. I love Ewan McGregor. But in my opinion this film was a dull let-down.Why was I so disappointed?For a film that literally cries out for extravagant dance numbers, this film merely had a lot of action that through trick editing was merely *pretending* to be extravagant dance numbers. The scenes switch so quickly that you can never really see anyone truly dance, probably because they're not truly dancing. The exception is the final dance number where the Argentinian and one of the ladies tango and re-enact the lovers' story. However, that episode is so long drawn out and full of triteness that it becomes tedious.On the subject of editing, I felt that the editing failed to provide the awe, energy and pizzazz that some of the dance numbers required. It left the actors looking awkward and ridiculous in parts, in particular the scene in which the group is demonstrating the ideas for the new show to the Baron.Although Nicole Kidman is beautiful and talented, I didn't think she was warm and sensual enough for the role of Satine, and although she's not a "bad" singer, I felt that most of her big songs lacked the "oomph" required to give proper effect.Overall, the feel of the film was very juvenile. I felt like the director was "dumbing down" the sophistication of what should/could have been a smart, naughty story about love, lust, envy and greed in the underworld. Instead, it felt sanitized, and because of that became nothing more than a typical Hollywood date movie in lingerie.But the most painful of all were the dialog and the music. 90% of the film steals lines from contemporary pop music. And the lines are so brief and ecclectic it had me feeling like it was targeted towards people with Attention Deficit Disorder. I can only guess that it was an attempt to appeal to the masses -- and since I'm one of the few who didn't like this film, I guess it succeeded in that regard. Clever appropriation of well known music and words can be very effective, but in my opinion "Moulin Rouge!" missed the mark, choosing to totally saturate the film with line after line of quotes from mainstream pop music...not even something cleverly obscure, only the most obvious and mainstream so that the most unworldly of viewers was likely to "get it". I found myself thinking "If they utter one more quote from Elton John I'm going to puke!".So what did I love about the film?The costumes and sets were fun, fantastical and lush. They created a magical atmosphere that promised more than the rest of the film could deliver.And Ewan McGregor was by far the shining star of the film. He's a strong singer and absolutely brilliant actor. Too bad his performance couldn't eclipse the rest of the film's shortcomings for me.In summary, it's a cute film, great for a family with kids, but don't expect anything too deep or original. Sadly, it suffers from "over-Hollywoodization". It's just too corny and trite.</fullReview>

Until my friends raved about it and said how different it was from normal musicals. I love music and they said i would love this movie seeing that they used more modern music in the songs. So i thought lets give it a try..long story short it is now my favorite movie. It blew me away, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, I laughed, I cried when Christian cried, and I wanted to sing along. The music was wonderful I loved how they took modern music by Elton John and turned it into this wonderful love ballad..even though it was already. I cried when i heard Come What May, it was the most romantic love ballad i have ever heard. And Ewan McGregor's voice out shines his GOOD looks..he is beautiful. I want to be the Green Fairy...and I am now a true Bohemian (Truth, Beauty, Truth, Freedom, but above all things Love).</fullReview>

A.A touching and heartfelt LOVE STORY,brought to life by a brilliant director,and perfect performances by a talented and committed cast of actors.All the performances are flawless,especially Nicole Kidmans.It is her ROLE OF A LIFETIME !! B.Great songs(especially El Tango de Roxanne)which do not interrupt the story but rather tell the story.Stunning use of popular music to connect on a emotional level with the viewers. C. A totally unique visual style which once you adapt to it, will blow you away. D.This film has it all.Story,acting,music,comedy,tragedy; - the whole nine yards. Look at it this way.If you don't like it(how sad),you can always sell it on E-bay for about what you paid for it.So its really a no lose situation.BUT,if it does connect with you,you will be one happy camper,as this is a MUST SEE / MUST HAVE movie. WARNING----- THis film is SERIOUSLY ADDICTIVE and I mean that exactly as it appears.With this one, Once is not nearly enough;in fact,I don't know that this movie could really ever wear out its welcome. ITS THAT GOOD !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bohemian Splendor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love "Moulin Rouge". It is my second favorite movie of all time("Princess Mononoke" is first). I KNOW that there are many poor souls out there who detest it; I for one believe this: If you didn't like it, it's either because you didn't get it, or you are simply a die-hard cynic. Yes, it is fast-paced and frenetic. Yes, it is predictable. It is supposed to be all of these things. But at the heart of all this frantic art, there lies one of the sweetest, most beautiful love stories in all of filmdom. Seeing Nicole Kidman (as Satine,the realistic courtesan ) and Ewan McGregor (as Christian, the innocent young amorist) in this movie causes a re-thinking of what great chemistry is: It always, always seems to me that these two people are truly in love with one another. It is a testimony to Baz Lurhmann that this film is so sincere. So many movies today cop out and play it safe. Here is a film that wholeheartedly believes in something, and isn't ashamed of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible and utterly fantastic visual feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course this one goes without saying: the story of "Moulin Rouge!" is thoroughly just one enormous, worn-out cliché. You can love the film but you can't deny it. However, the movie is such an incredible and fantastic visual feast who could possibly bother to whine about it?"Moulin Rouge!" is more than just eye candy, it's a larger than life experience filled with exceptional music and touching Oscar calibre performances. The use of songs like Nirvana's "Smells like teen spirit" or Queen's "The Show must go on" in the context such as this is something massively ingenious. Every scene makes you speechless and is clearly a work of a true genius. There I was thinking that Baz Luhrmann's previous masterpiece "Romeo + Juliet" was visually spectacular. How little did I know what was about to come.Since no one has made a decent musical in decades "Moulin Rouge!" was facing a huge challenge. As it happened, the film brings back the whole genre as an art form that should still be taken seriously. "Moulin Rouge!" was a same kind of a powerful and unique experience to me as "The Lord of the rings" movies. If you are among the lucky ones who had the privilege to watch "Moulin Rouge!" for the first time in the movie theater then I can only say that I envy you. I was about to watch the film in the cinema too but somehow I missed my opportunity. If you haven't seen this film I suggest you should watch at least the original widescreen version by using a television set as large as possible.This is a musical for people who love musicals just as much as much as for people who don't usually prefer to watch them. "Moulin Rouge!" is a musical for this generation. If this was a perfect world "Moulin Rouge!" would be one of the most recognized love stories in the history of movies. I'm sure after 20 years this is a modern classic. Of course it is one already but what I'm saying is people will never forget it. "Moulin Rouge!" is one of the greatest spectacles movie history has ever seen. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film In A Long Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first, and to date, ONLY film that I have seen that has ever provoked me to comment on. One of the few masterpieces of this new era of films (1995 onward), Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge! has captivated my soul. It is the only film that has evoked every possible emotion out of me. For those who haven't seen the film, please note that there may be some things spoiled in the next few sentences.I laughed with the bohemians, was smitten and totally in love with Christians and Satine, felt the burning rage and jealousy of Christian as his love was toyed with, was as genuinely torn apart as Satine as she balanced true love with her career, and admittedly cried when Satine died, leaving Christian to bear it all.I strongly recommend this film to anyone and everyone. In it's lavishness is the pure and unadulterated love story that will surely leave you spellbound and breathless when leaving the theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This story is about love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love and be loved in return. This movie has passed "Life Is Beautiful" as my favourite movie of all time. It's got everything: romance, jealousy, heartbreak, revenge, sadness, happiness, DANCE, MUSIC! EVERY-THING! My biggest regret is to never have seen it in a theater.I saw it for the first time almost a year ago, shortly after it came out on DVD. When I saw it, I was totally confounded by the first fifteen minutes of the movie. The camera work, the music, everything went by so fast that I had a hard time figuring out where Baz Luhrmann was trying to go. Then eventually, I caught up with the pace of the movie. I absolutely enjoyed it the first time around, and I watched the extended Tango de Roxanne over and over again.The use of the music was ingenious and marvelously magical. (I must say, though, that I've been listening to the soundtrack almost every day for the past six months). I am rarely moved when I watch a movie but this one moves me to tears.I don't like musicals (I did like Grease when I was still a kid, I watched about 10 minutes of Evita before turning it off, and although my kids watch The Sound Of Music on a regular basis, I have yet to see the whole movie). But this movie, with its simplistic storyline and reused music, is an absolute masterpiece.I think the only way to really, truly appreciate this movie to its fullest is to watch it more than once. Baz Luhrmann has said that he wanted to recreate the confusion, the splendour and the craziness of the Moulin Rouge when it first opened in 1899. Nowadays, audiences are totally blasé. There is a preponderance of sex, violence and a total absence of innocence and bewilderment in our modern society.Imagine entering into a world that is unlike anything you've ever seen before, something you couldn't imagine in your wildest dreams. That's how people probably felt the first time they went to the Moulin Rouge. In order to understand it and appreciate it, they needed to go back again and again. Luhrmann has succeeded in generating the same feeling with today's apathetic audiences. From the music, to the dialog, to the story itself, there are constantly two things going on at the same time. It is nervewracking and confusing but highly effective.I believe this is one of those movies that will stand the test of time. After all, it's a movie about truth, beauty, freedom, and above all things, love!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>« Moulin Rouge! » is, unlike many main stream and commercial movie lovers might have told you, a waste of time. With directing that looks more like what you would see in a stupid MTV video, those who've seen the awful video for the main song of this film (sung by the biggest amount of prostitutes put under the title of singers I've seen reunited together!), « Moulin Rouge! » doesn't bring anything new, except maybe another Blockbuster hit that will please to average North American families and make millions at the Box-Office... How amazing?Right, the film itself is a musical that, by the way, features lots of remakes of very popular and modern songs, and doesn't deliver at all any other feeling or atmosphere you will see in masterpieces such as « Singin' In The Rain », which is a great musical. I know it is not happening in the same period of time, and it wasn't made in the same period of time, but the really disgusting aspect of it that really upsets me, especially when I think about all the nominations it got for Oscars (these guys are getting even harder to trust every year!) is the really shallow display of everything in this film. The film itself simply looks like a TV commercial that tries to sell you how beautiful the costumes are, how happy the characters are, how sad someone's death is, how much knowledge they have (Wow! They even know what Absinthe is! These guys have culture, have they??UH? And I can prove that this is not a typical American film, yes I can prove it, because it has references to foreign cultures and some characters have weird accents that sound less natural than Arnie's American accent in Commando!) and they really try hard to create an atmosphere?but fail big time! There is nothing magic in all this mess, except maybe for this hypnotized, shallow generation of MTV fans that know absolutely nothing about cinema and think they have cinematic culture because they saw "Titanic". (Spoilers coming up) Nicole Kidman's death in the film is truly one of the least sad ones I've ever seen, and if someone cried for this, they should definitely not see a REALLY emotional film. Kidman's character was not likeable at all, and I'd say that in « Moulin Rouge! », not unlike many other of her films, Kidman's performance is like a fashion show?she just wants all the attention on the screen, she wants to be the show?isn't that?hum?shallow? Indeed. Her character is a big cliche and is explicitly unidimensional. Ewan MacGregor is good, he's Ewan MacGergor after all, and he's a great actor and he has the most interesting role in this movie. John Leguizamo's not bad either. But, again, the characters are pretty slightly developed, and the director spent more time showing his « beautiful » plastic dresses and costumes and playing boring songs and putting them in boring music video-like sequences rather than doing essential things for his film.  An overall pretty empty film, with nothing but average, shallow entertainment that is the equivalent of two hours of MTV videos with better acting?Not very surprising it got nominations for Oscars, because these days only good taste is accepted and typical American films (very formulatic in many cases!) are privileged. So, I know I may have been a little severe with this film, but it really is the definition of the word « SHALLOW »?maybe that's why this word appeared so many times in my review. If you spend your days watching MTV, and if you cry when you watch teen movies, this might be for you?But if you're looking for something that goes deeper than skin, plastic, and absolutely not touching love stories, you'll be deceived. This is a better version of « Glitter » with better intentions (OUCH! That's a big punch in Mariah's face!) and a setting in the past. Oh yeah, and Ewan MacGregor and John Leguizamo's performances are good (this time I won't compare it to « Glitter », because there is truly a difference for this point?.and again, your side's not the bright one, Mariah?you don't « glitter » that much, you know?), but don't save this film. Watch « Singin' In The Rain » instead?that is a great musical. I give « Moulin Rouge! » 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, it's strange how most people either love it or hate it. No middle ground. Anyway . . . When Moulin Rouge was being advertised, I shuddered at the thought of having to sit through a musical. I HATE musicals! So, I skipped it. About a year later, there was nothing new at Blockbuster, so I picked it up.WOW! Moulin Rouge turned out to be such a wonderful movie (probably the only musical I'll ever like, though). Everything about it was fantastic and impressing.It's interesting because instead of the actors telling you what they feel, they sing it (and you can actually like the songs)! Music and singing can express feelings that words cannot. The simplest phrase when sung can add a lot more meaning and emotion.The songs were entertaining, the costumes and scenery were amazing, and the story line really keeps your interest. This film is very different and unique, which makes it so worth the time.</fullReview>

But I stayed to watch the whole thing and I can't tell you how glad I am that I did. Not only is the acting amazing, but the singing was out of this world! Who knew Nicole Kidman could sing like that (I sure couldn't, especially if I was hanging from a trapeze at the same time...) and I repeatedly listen to Ewan's songs (his voice just makes me fall in love with him). The story just rips your heart out (in the best possible way) and I think I've watched it so many times that I can pretty much talk along with the movie (I'm just a little bit of a movie geek...). Baz Luhrman did an incredible job with this movie and Catherine Martin's costumes were so gorgeous!

It might have an original song, but not much else. It is an overinflated vainglorious mess. I can imagine the director and his cohorts congratulating themselves on their artistic brilliance after every little oddity. Toulouse Latrec with a Winchester Lisp? give me a break.

		<fullReview>Moulin was a big beautiful, energetic waste of time. I give it's makers credit for creating a rather interesting diversion, from the norm. This movie really stinks as a musical, even though the staging of the production numbers was well done. Whoever sang for Ewan McGregor, should be arrested for assault with a irritating weapon of a voice. Ewan McGregor was convincing as a young man, hopelessly, foolishly in love with a very shady lady, with a cough. Let's face it, he must have been totally unconscious, not to have noticed. Nicole Kidman, was drop dead gorgeous, especially for a woman on the verge of death, I felt a little offended at this intermittent cough was used soley for dramatic effect. This woman had one of the most contagious diseases of all time, and would have infected many people way before these events could have happened. Kidman's characterization was arresting, but not enough to forget that she was a user, a manipulator, a cheap, overused woman. Nicole Kidman is very talented, but if she actually had the charisma to pull this part off, it could have mad a very interesting movie.Again, congratulations are in order for the movie's design. Generally high marks for the two major actors; for meeting the challenge of very difficult roles. I don't buy the idea of re-cycled music, even if it is fairly well utilized. With all the effort, that was put into creating a unique visual extravaganza; an equal effort to create a score to match, would have been an major accomplishment.I agree with the person who said this would have worked better as a stage play. I think it could have made a great stage play, even lacking the full movie glitz. Perhaps, this would have made for a more personal work of art, with a heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...go back to the source. Yes, this was an enjoyable, hallucinogenic, MTV-video-and-sampling-era piece, but much of the hyperbole written by admirers here is probably from the keyboards of those so young they were never fortunate enough to have seen Pennies From Heaven. No, not that dire 90-minute Hollywood version (what WAS Potter thinking of, anyway?), but the original 1978 TV miniseries featuring Bob Hoskins and Cheryl Campbell. Sure, Baz Luhrmann lays it all on with a trowel, with Meliés moons and even a touch of Murnau tossed in there, but he succeeded more in hurting my eyes than actually blowing my neurons.Dennis Potter's Pennies from Heaven, swiftly followed by a dose of the even more potent magic of The Singing Detective (1986), would make this film seem very shallow. Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing much but a grasp of fast-food moviemaking and cutting for the attention-challenged. But then again, Pennies From Heaven has 48 votes, and Moulin Rouge had over 20,000 at the last count, so what does that tell you? Beg, steal, or borrow a copy of the original Pennies From Heaven and then see if what glitters now in Moulin Rouge really IS gold.P.S. Ewan McGregor made his small-screen début in another Potter production, the slightly iffy but still infinitely superior Lipstick on Your Collar (1993). I wonder how HE compares the two works?</fullReview>

It is probably dedicated to these ideals because it is so utterly bereft of any of them.Truth -- it is a work set in 1899, yet its music comes from modern day pop songs. If you want to see an original, good musical, see the episode of Lexx entitled Brigadoom.Beauty -- To paraphrase Wendell Lawson (only because I can't find the exact quote): It looks like something Walt Disney threw up.Freedom -- Okay, maybe there is some semblance of a yearning for freedom in this film, but I can't really tell.Love -- If your idea of love includes manipulation, coercion, deception, and mammon, then it has it in spades.Okay, I don't know anything about bohemians, and I don't really care, but if you want to see a film that embodies real ideals of truth, beauty, freedom, and above all, love, then see Life is Beautiful.But, if your goal is to slosh your brain around without consuming alcohol, this will get you a hangover sized headache within twenty minutes.Whatever you choose, good luck!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly don't understand the hype about this movie. The acting was mediocre at best. The cinematography was good, but it was damaged by poor editing. Flashy, quick scene cuts dominate this film. The plot was predictable and I thought the dialogue was too fast and furious to even keep up with in many places and I personally disliked the usage of 80's/90's pop and rock lyrics and music. I will say I was amazed at how well Ewan McGregor could sing; he blew Nicole Kidman out of the water.I found "Moulin Rouge!" insipid and uninspired. Ultimately, blame for this film's flaws can be laid squarely on the director Baz Luhrmann (who also co-wrote the screenplay). At least it wasn't as bad Luhrmann's butchering of Shakespeare in Romeo and Juliet (1996). 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't want to see this movie. I'll just come right out and say that up front. From the very first preview I was turned off by all the singing and dancing and glitter. I was incredibly bored one day, however, and a friend who really loved it insisted that I would, as well. I didn't think so, but I decided to be open-minded.I was ill-prepared for the next torturous four hours (or however long it actually was; it certainly seemed like four hours or so) that I was subjected to.This film is so shallow as to be less than one-dimensional, if that's possible. Everyone was so busy showing off that there was no time for any character development. It was impossible to care about any of them. The tale itself was trite, rehashed old crud served up in a glittery package. Oh, but wait! They're singing awful pop songs from the '70's and '80's that everyone hates! How terribly clever and original!Oddly enough, for a movie that moved so fast and had so much going on at once that I literally got a migraine after watching it, it certainly dragged on and on. By the time I finally made it to the end, I just couldn't wait for the main character to DIE ALREADY so that this nightmare would end, but she had to cough for about 6 years and look beautiful first.This film's broad appeal truly causes me to fear for our society as a whole. The only two kinds of people that I could see enjoying this film would be either people with severe ADD or fans of Elton John. Or perhaps a frightening combination of the two. I guess there are more of these people around than I thought.If you have a soul and want to keep it, avoid this horrible, horrible movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this movie was very campy and a visual feast. The music worked quite well. I was entertained. The film reminded me of "Brazil" and "The Island of the Lost Children", both made totally on sets (as I recall) and both involving innocents who encounter some highly wierd, grotesque people in some highly wierd, grotesque environments. Throw in visual references to Toulouse-Lautrec lithographs and take-off's on opera, and --- voila --- you have Moulin Rouge. Well, that's all there is. Do not look for more. The film certainly does not have the content and invention that "Brazil" (a really great movie) does. Actually, I would rather see "The Red Shoes" again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fail to see what all the fuss was over. The acting was above average, but the singing was poor. The plot in this movie is nothing new or to get excited over, it's just a retelling of a common tale of romance. The use of modern songs in the past might be what critics were so excited over, but these same critics condemned "A Knights Tale" for using a similar tactic, in the same year I might add. This movie was so boring my wife refused to watch it after the first 10 minutes, and it took me all 5 days of my rental to get through it. My friend also went through the same ritual, only this time he walked and his wife forced her way through it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bialystock and Bloom themselves couldn't have come up with a better formula for a bad movie. Rip off an old musical ("Cabaret"), set it in the past, and force your characters to spend the entire movie singing bad 80's pop songs. Wait--not bad enough. Let there only be about four or five bad 80's pop songs, and force your characters to sing each one for a half an hour straight, until no one who watches the movie can ever hear the songs again without being traumatized all over again. Get some real A-list, truly great actors, and run their careers into the ground by forcing them to dress in tablecloths and prance around serenading random passersby. Then edit it all so that it's completely incomprehensible and impossible to understand.That's a pretty good formula for a bad movie. And the fact that "Moulin Rouge" is now nominated for eight Oscars and is well entrenched on the top 250 list only goes to prove that Mel Brooks was even more visionary than we thought. "Moulin Rouge" is the real world's "Springtime for Hitler."Where did "Moulin Rouge" go right? I haven't the faintest idea. I sat there for two hours watching this thing, knowing that so many people loved it--I just assumed it would get better after a while. But it just kept getting worse.This really is a love-it-or-hate-it movie. I don't think there's any middle ground. And I think it really depends on what you think of the use of modern pop songs in a movie set in 1900. Apparently Luhrmann justified it as necessary to convey the idea that Ewan McGregor's character was writing lyrics that transcended time and spoke to the true nature of love (or something along those lines). Even if that's true, that still doesn't justify the "Like A Virgin" sequence. Or "Smells Like Teen Spirit," for that matter. Or "The Sound Of Music." And if I ever thought "Your Song" transcended time and spoke to the true nature of love, I certainly don't now, after having to endure McGregor and Kidman first singing the lyrics, then speaking the lyrics to each other, then speaking the lyrics to other people, then singing them again, then singing them again later...I like Elton John, but that went on for a half an hour. (Interrupted, that is, by another song that was "So a-nnoy-ing! I can't clear it from my head! So a-nnoy-ing! It will stay there till I'm dead!")So, in conclusion, I hated this movie. I gave it a 2/10 on the strength of the acting, which at least is very good. The fact that Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor and Jim Broadbent are at least watchable in this movie is a testament to their respective greatnesses as actors. If Kidman wins Best Actress, I won't be too upset. (If it wins any other Oscars at all, I will break my television with a hammer.)Warning to all: if you're watching this movie for the first time, and you get to the part (about five or ten minutes in) where Ewan McGregor belts out "The hills are alive with the sound of music," and you find yourself really hoping the rest of the movie isn't going to be like this, shut--it--off. It will not get better. If you're still tolerating it at that point, keep watching. You'll love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to enjoy this film. The comments here seem to be straight down the middle. You'll either love it or you'll loathe it. Granted, Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor are not bad (even though I didn't see any chemistry between them), they both have decent singing voices (although a little of MacGregor's singing goes a long way with me), and once the Duke puts two and two together, the film becomes better and more tolerable to watch. Some of the musical sequences were downright painful (i.e. the "Like A Virgin" scene made me want to reach for a barf bag). It would have been great if this had been a satire film, or a spoof, but as a straight up serious film it lost me. If the Academy wanted to nominate Nicole Kidman, they should have recognized her incredible turn in The Others (a FAR superior film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story goes that when Andrew Lloyd Webber was writing his "Phantom of the Opera," he sought the assistance of none other than renowned lyricist Alan Lerner. Lerner could not commit to the project due to his poor health (indeed, he would pass away shortly afterwards) but he did offer the composer this advice regarding the story: "Don't ask too many questions. It just works."Lerner might very well have been speaking of "Moulin Rouge," a film which employs the most bizzare conglomeration of elements I've seen assembled in a film: a story reminiscent of Victorian grand opera, music courtesy of an adult-contemporary radio station, the production values of a Vegas spectacular and MTV-style cinematography. Reason indicates that it can't, shouldn't work...yet by some extraordinary miracle, it does.Not that "Moulin Rouge" is never in danger of collapsing under its own excess. The first twenty minutes or so are particularly jarring, as diverse peculiarites such as John Leguziamo's frenetic Toulouse-Lautrec, the theme to "The Sound of Music," a narcoleptic Argentinian, a hallucinogen-inspired fairy, "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend" and "Lady Marmalade"--not to mention more shots of legs and underclothing than a Victoria's Secret catalog--are thrown at us by Baz Luhrmann at such a rapid-fire pace that one fears the movie is running off without us. But just when we're about to give up hope, the writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) seranades dancer Satine (Nicole Kidman) with a warm and honest rendition of Elton John's "Your Song"--and it is then that "Moulin Rouge" really comes into its own.Christian and Satine, of course, fall in love--much to the irritation of Richard Roxburgh's Duke, who wants Satine for himself. The Duke is financing the Moulin Rouge's conversion to a legitamite theatre, so owner Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent) is anxious to keep him happy. And if that wasn't bad enough--well, that's a nasty cough Satine's got there...Melodramatic? Of course it is--but the movie makes no pretensions of being otherwise. The secret is in Luhmann's ability to walk the fine line between the delightfully over-the-top and the deeply sincere, and for most of the film it works. The dramatic scenes are touching, and the comedy so wonderfully bizarre, that the film manages to have its heart on its sleve and its tongue in its cheek both at the same time.McGregor and Kidman work well together, and are surprisingly capable singers to boot (McGregor has the better of the two voices). Broadbent balances dramatic grandeur with broad comedy--his rendition of "Like A Virgin" is a highlight of the latter category. The costumes, sets and choreography are gorgeous, but only occasionally does Luhrmann slow the camera down long enough for us to enjoy them (the DVD rectifys this somewhat, providing a fine collection of production sketches and stills which allow for better perusal of these elements). Like it or hate it, "Moulin Rouge" is nothing if not one of a kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A massive storm of music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't like movie musicals, don't make the mistake of dismissing "Moulin Rouge". For it is no ordinary musical. It's more of a massive storm of music, visuals and emotions, resplendent with all the decadence of turn-of-the-century cultural life in Paris, loaded with musical anachronisms ranging from Nirvana to "Sound of Music", all with a rapid music video style. Compelling, spellbinding and very, very funny. The story, otherwise crippled by sentimentality and awful cheesiness, is brought to its feet by this enormous mass of motion. Ol' Paris anno 1899 is brought to scandalous life and the drinking of Absinthe is glorified by the absinthe fairy, Kylie Minogue. This is the very definition of entertainment.10/10 for an outrageous, insane monster movie musical. I'm off to buy the soundtrack.</fullReview>

The opening is so ridiculous with the modern songs "Nature Boy" written by a 17 year old boy probably in the 40's by "Om" a nickname my sister in law gave him. She knew him well. This movie takes place in 1900. The opening was so boring, I slipped out of the theater and joined the movie "Shrek" for the second time. When it was over I returned to "Moulin Rouge" for the last 10 minutes. Other than the lavish sets which were not shown off as well as could have been...it was again simply awful. And I love Nicole....Oh well - at least I got to enjoy "Shrek" again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well made, if still a spectacle ultimately</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buz Luhrmann's Moulin Rogue is a good example of a film where having songs in it repeatedly and sung by the cast isn't distracting from the rest of the film (unlike the recent Dancer in the Dark). In fact, considering the frenzied pace, razor sharp camera cuts and settings, songs do this film some good. Moulin Rogue, as we learn was a very big and flashy dancing and practically insane place for really entertaining people (notice the sarcasm). Enter in a dreaming writer (Ewan McGregor) as he soon find that his most important philosophy (I believe in love, he states) is put to a test with the lovely and tempting Satine (Nicole Kidman). Then the usually noticeable convention happens in the story, but that's not what gives this film it's high rating.Luhrmann presents a musical that hasn't really been seen or heard before. He uses a Technicolor film approach, mixed with contemporary songs (some might remember last month's Knight's Tale tried this trick) and 50's dance numbers. It is actually quite a stupendous spectacle once you surpass the flaws. Kudos to the cast, of course, but also to Lurhmann, editor Jill Bilcock, cinematographer Donald McAlphine and production designer Catherine Martin for making such a different piece. By the way, in case anyone is wondering, this is the only film where you will see (originaly it was) Roxanne turned into a Broadway type of production number.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love is a many-splendored thing... this movie too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christian is a young poet who arrives to Paris in 1899, the summer of love to be part of the bohemian revolution that's happening. With some luck and the help from a group of bohemians that includes Toulouse-Lautrec he ends up being the main writer of the most ambitious show that's about to be presented in the Moulin Rouge (the most famous night club of its time). What he doesn't know is that he would find true love personified in Satine, the star courtesan and aspiring actress.However, things won't be easy once Christian and Satine are together: a jealous Duke who wants Satine only for him (who also happens to be the main investor in the show), Harold Zidler's refusal to the relationship (mostly because of the fear of losing the Duke's sponsorship) and a fatal disease condemn their destiny as lovers.The plot described above easily sounds taken from any conventional romance novel and could have been an average period piece. In Baz Luhrmann's particular vision it becomes a completely bizarre and indescribable experience. Why? Luhrmann takes the risk of using a forgotten movie genre: the musical and with some of the most emblematic pop songs of the 90's creates what he calls a "real artificiality" in which anything is possible. Or where else is possible to witness a very unusual rendition of Like a virgin sung by Jim Broadbent? or Ewan Mcgregor singing' Elton John's Your Song? Another risk Lhurmann takes is hiring actors that aren't exactly known for being gifted singers. Nonetheless the risk works and Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, Jim Broadbent and the rest of the cast prove to have stunning voices. In addition to that, they also deliver powerful performances that reach a very wide field of emotions, from the most absolute absurd to the most heartbreaking tragedy being completely believable.A very important element for Luhrmann's vision to be complete is the recreation of the 1899 Paris. Luhrmann and his team decide not to do a carbon copy of the Moulin Rouge and its elements and instead they create a whole new Moulin Rouge based on how new audiences would imagine it if it had been existed in this time. Also the costume design has an important role here, every gown and dress has own life and differentiates this movie from others.Also the choreography of the musical numbers are completely breathtaking and remind us every moment we're not watching a typical musical movie. And that's Luhrmann's main intention: to create a completely different movie that becomes an experience for the audiences. Many people won't agree with this point of view, but those who agree are grateful for a many-splendored thing like Moulin Rouge!</fullReview>

Not even half way through the third showing I had to have the film stopped because my search was obviously hopeless and I simply could not take it any longer.No, I was not expecting the wonderful 1952 film by John Huston, based on the novel of Pierre La Mure's fictional account of French artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, yet that is what I suggest you see instead of this.I like generally enjoy musicals, and I like the individual cast members in other things, but everyone involved this piece of trash should be soundly slapped! It is an insult to the eyes and ears.I do not usually condone extreme measures, such as book burning, but in this case I'll make an exception.I have seen hundreds of films in my fifty plus years, including "The Terror of Tiny Town" (1938) but even that is Oscar material next to this audio-visual vomit.

By 2am in the morning, I was bawling uncontrollably, and then just sat there and worshiped every name in the credits list. Director Baz Luhrmann is simply amazing. The way he incorporated the music into this movie added so much to the plot. I have to say, my favorite musical part is when the Diamond Dogs come out singing "Lady Marmalade" and then the men come in singing "Smells Like Teen Spirit." You would think the songs were written for the movie the way they fit so well into the plot! I'm amazed every time I watch it. The acting that went into this movie was incredible. If you think about it, Moulin Rouge is a play inside a play inside a book inside an opera inside a movie. And yet, as confusing as that sounds, it works out perfectly. Kidman and McGregor are amazing together, and their accents are adorable. Besides them, I admire Jim Broadbent who played Zidler the most. He had a very complex character that was hard to express, and he nailed it. It's been three years since it's release and I still watch it religiously. That's how much I admire this movie. To not give this movie a ten, you must be either emotionally dead, or male.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have the distinct feeling Baz Luhrmann would like to direct MTV videos. The quick cuts and glossy look of this film reminds me of a Spice Girl's video and has about as much of a story. This film is such an ode to MTV culture that I would call it "irritating to the eyes". The ultra-quick MTV cuts and the pointless focus on eroticism trivialize any attempt at a plot. Moulin Rouge is the "Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" set in France with the addition of an extremely irritating cinematic style. Baz Luhrmann began his career with melodramatic schlock (Strictly Ballroom, Romeo and Juliet) and has now out done himself. The popularity of this film is understandable as the average movie goer and music buyer indulges in what is heavily promoted but the discerning viewer should realize what an irritating piece of celluloid crap this movie is.

I am a fan of both Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, and I found their talents to be completely wasted in this brightly-colored mess. Maybe I'm too old to get it; this appears to have been edited for the MTV generation, or any viewer with a severely limited attention span.

I have long considered that today's young singers and dramatists seem to have made it because of a politically correct system which decrees that one should never criticise youngsters who are trying their hardest even when it is patently obvious they have little or no talent. TV's Pop Stars and Pop Idols are cases in point. This film simply gives credibility to the notion that today's young filmmakers, actors and singers have nothing original to give us. The film consists of a paper thin plot to string a load of excellent and not so excellent songs together, none of which have been written for the film. Jim Broadbent tries hard to play the part of the ringmaster but even his performance is less his own and more that of a combination of the host of UK television's "The Good Old Days", and the ringmaster who appeared regularly on our UK screens with Billy Smart's Circus (older British readers of around Jim's age will know exactly the two I mean). Sadly the success of the film only serves to encourage my belief that today's UK society has become as gullible as those in the USA. Given the huge amount of hype for the film and the number of luvvies telling us it is the best thing since sliced bread, our audiences have fallen into the trap of the Emperor's new clothes and convinced themselves beforehand that it would be excellent. The only other plausible reason for its success is the love affair women have with Ewan McGregor and the chance for men to see Nicole Kidman in her scanties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really, really boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A had great expectations when I rented this movie, having just seen Chicago. I am also a rather big fan of musicals, thoug mostly the Broadway-style, which is often a bit different tha movie-style. Anyway, I sat down with a friend to whatch this. And about an hour into the movie we turned it of. Why? Because it was really, really boring. Let's go through this one fault at a time, and keep in mind that I didn't whatch all of it, so if it turns brilliant after an hour or so, please accept my apologies:- The singing. Meaning the voices and performances of the actors. Not really too bad. But still, someone who could really sing would have been better. It is after all a musical.- The music. Dreadful. Sure, in theory it seems like a good idea to take many different, but good songs, take a bit of this and a bit of that, and give it all the same sound, more or less. But it is just terrible. No song they sing can ever rise above the fact that you have heard it better elsewhere. Not only that, much of the music doesn't fit in, and the whole score is rather weak.- The plot. I really do believe that I could have written a better one myself. There are no surprises, and it is in no way original. This is the greatest dissapointment in the film, that the plot is so transparrent. If you like it because it is a tragic lovestory, there are so many better films out there. Someone compared this movie to west side story. Not a too original plot there either, but the mood and music, not to say the dancing, is completely in another league.- The editing. A bit more personal opinion here; I just didn't like it. Too many scenes were chaotic.I believe that was all. I gave this movie a 1, maby a bit prejudiced by the fact that so many gave it a good rating. I hate it when people admire that which should not be admired. Both me and my friend are interested in films, and have through this developed the sort of expertise that all reviewers here claim to have. This is not a macho-attack on a chick-flick, it is a reflected review of a really boring film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just didn't expect any movie to be so bad. I will never believe the critics and the academy awards people again. I like musicals, and this was an insult. Is it trying to revitalize the musical, spoof musicals or kill the musical dead so it never sings another note? No original songs, just borrowed lyrics. Kidman isn't one of the greatest actresses out there but this is her all time worst. I liked her in the others though. Direction for this film, well, it gave me a headache, style over substance. Weak plot. Jesus Christ Superstar kicks this films a$$ a hundred times over. See that if you want to see a good musical. West side story's pretty good too. But whatever you do stay away from Moulin Rouge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worst movie musical of the last 25 years (and that's saying a lot)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite some rave reviews when it first came out, Moulin Rouge is totally inessential. The story is a standard love triangle, with no performances to distinguish it. Plot twists are utterly predictable. The direction is generally haphazard, cutting much too quickly from shot to shot (most movie musicals today have this problem, yet Chicago succeeds despite it).But worst of all is the music, a collection of pop standards rewritten for orchestra and vocalist. Some are almost unrecognizable, and there are interesting juxtapositions. But there's a reason it's called "pop music" -- it isn't any good musically. Most of the music is painful to listen to, without the energy of the stadium stage and the grind of drums and guitars. The gimmick is clever for 20 minutes and after that I was fast-forwarding to the end of musical numbers.I like movie musicals, but this kind of joyless cross-genre attempt to grab younger audiences will just drive them off when legitimate musicals are made into good movies -- such as Chicago. The most recent good example of the cross-genre movie musical, Madonna's Evita, is a much better film (and an infinitely better musical). If you want to rent a newish movie musical, get Newsies. The death of movie musicals has been declared prematurely, but another Moulin Rouge will certainly doom them</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nauseating Film........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MOULIN ROUGE is quite simply a physical assault on the senses. The viewer is attacked with pop-culture sensibilities and a highly marketable soundtrack. This is not helped by the director, Baz Luhrmann, who will not let you forget that you are watching a film directed by Baz Luhrmann. Enough, we get it, you have a distinct visual style, that's great...now make a watchable film. I made it about half-way through his ROMEO + JULIET before I had to take half a white valium. This "resurgence of the musical" simply sweeps an arm across Billboard Music's top twenty list and arranges such classics as 'Like a Virgin' and 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' as over-directed large-scale musical numbers...wow. This film vomits garish style and dated cinematic techniques to the point where it becomes unbearable.I understand that Nicole Kidman's character was supposed to be vampish, but c'mon, Elvira had more nuance than this. Ewan McGregor is the only one who narrowly escapes this mess (although he should not sacrifice his film career for one in music). There are more characters doing jerky, sped-up backflips than any one person should have to tolerate in a single production. The story...huh, was there a story? If there was, Baz Luhrmann did not handle it very well. A trendy, self indulgent waste of time. 1/10Quick Story: While viewing this film in the theater, I was so overwhelmed with desperation, that I unlaced my boot and crafted a make-shift noose. I proceeded to wear this about my neck all through the movie and continued to do so following the film. I got some strange looks from my fellow movie-goers, who seemed to have enjoyed MOULIN ROUGE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>`Cabaret 2001' ? Almost thirty years later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that struck me about the movie (I wanted to see it at the theaters but just never got around to it, so on a whim, picked up the video recently and it has now turned into one of the movies I'm obsessed with), was how much it reminded me of `Cabaret'. Not because of the plot, or anything that could refer back to the 1972 movie (except maybe that both are period pieces: `Cabaret' during the decadent times right before the rise of the Nazi movement; and `Moulin Rouge' during the fin-de-si?cle decadent bohemian times), but just the fact that it presented itself as a musical that totally throws itself in your face. Why TC ever split with Ms. Kidman is beyond me ? she is truly magnificent (her voice in some of the songs she performs sounds rather like Madonna during the early years ? not bad). Funny, I've always had an aversion to the idea of visiting Paris (ever!), but after seeing this movie, I kinda, sorta want to go now. Perhaps I, too, can eventually say, `The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.' This is not for the faint of heart when it comes to drama, but it could just be me ? I cry at the drop of a hat. It's actually an amusing *dramedy* that anyone who watches it, and who is prone to suspension of disbelief, would pray for death-by-consumption if only to die in the arms of a Ewan McGregor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>but what is even more disturbing, it achieved both critical acclaim and box office success. There is no denying Buz Luhrmann put a huge amount of effort into making what is at times visually dazzling, but that does not compensate for what is a lame story, and mostly poor performances. As a Scotsman I do like to see Ewan McGregor do well but this is his poorest performance to date, and even worst he spends much of the film singing despite the fact that he cannot sing. Nicole Kidman puts in a rather uninspiring performance and also struggles due to the fact that her voice is not up to what is required in this role. Jim Broadbent, admittedly puts in an excellent show as the eccentric Harold Zidler, but that is one of the few redeeming features of this lacklustre film. As soon as the novelty of watching a musical set in Paris in 1900 with the music taken from a century later, wears off (which is ten minutes into the film), the viewer is left to watch a shell of a film, all style and no substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't trash this film because I didn't see the whole thing - having left with a friend who insisted on walking out about 1/2way through. I would have otherwise toughed it out but, after a full hour, was nowhere close to being engaged by this work.I can't say the acting was bad because I honestly didn't see any acting and any that was there would have been lost through the distractions of rapid zoom shots and numerous (way-too-close) close-ups. It sure had style - but we've seen (and heard) it all before on MTV. And although Kidman and McGregor were surprisingly good singers, the song productions were just too disjointed, unoriginal, over the top and unfunny for me.Okay, I'll admit that I'm not a big fan of musicals and prefer plot lines and character development to glitz and an omnipresent soundtrack. My apologies to those who truly loved this film (for its whimsy I'm guessing?) but I just couldn't find anything to like.Recommended for those who like musicals, fast-paced editing, lush sets or who are just curious to see Kidman and McGregor sing old Elton John songs over and over.Can't give this one a thumbs up or down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can I describe the movie Moulin Rouge? Glittery multi colored cotton candy? a huge flashy cubic zirconia diamond? hallucinations of a drunken drag queen who has taken too many bad drugs? Yes, all those! The movie was one long series of glitzy shouting melodramatic climaxes interspersed now and then with some soap opera dialogue. Acting??? No room for it. Plot???? trashy remake of La Boheme (speaking of La Boheme, if you want to see a tragic love story set to music, see the opera La Boheme?.avoid Moulin Rouge). In short Moulin Rouge is a triumph of glitzy style over substance. Special effects, fancy camera work, and choppy editing run amuck! On top of that the singers whisper their lyrics then shout them, one gets frazzled by all the razzle-dazzle. When the cliché climax finally came, I was so benumbed by all the frenetic scenes that instead of shouting: More! More! (for a good movie), I beseeched Hollywood: Less! Less!!!!.  Moulin Rouge reflects our pop culture, where special effects and over the top screaming singing has replaced substance and intelligence and genuine emotions. It says, it you scream loud enough and make it flashy enough, they will come, and buy?. All in all a total disaster?so much talent, clever sets, numbers, camera work, editing, good actors,?and all the director could come up with is a 110 minute MTV music video, and a bad one at that. If you like music videos, then you may like this movie. you will be safe, there is no substance to it. Just eat that glistening spun sugar and go for the ride!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the previews for this movie I thought it was a movie I would fall in love with. Unfortunately the movie was NOTHING like the previews, at least the ones I saw. For the first 15 minutes of the movie i thought this was going to be fabulous. I even thought the use of Nirvana's song when first at the Moulin Rouge was a nice touch, the song was well used and appropriate. Soon after that everything went to pot. This movie was an attempt at a modernization of La Boheme... La Boheme is a fabulous piece of literature. A few years back a show came out on Broadway called RENT. This was an absolutely wonderful show, a rock musical with an entirely original score. Moulin Rouge was an insult to both La Boheme and Rent.Aside from Beautiful costumes (which most sequences went entirely too fast to even catch a good glimpse of) this movie has few redeeming qualities. The plot is shallowed, cheesed out and lacking and the whole story brought to an elementary level. It seems perhaps Luhrman used the renditions of 80s songs to gain the interest of younger generations that might not have gone to see the film if they knew it was a musical all its own. Gilbert and Sullivan style 80s songs do not a good movie make. If they had went to the trouble to make an original score I would have been impressed. Seeing the list of people he had working on the movie there was more than enough creative people that that movie could have had original score. Instead the butchered hit songs from a previous decade. It was a show of bad judgment or cowardice of attempting a modern musical on it's own two feet.I truly appreciated Baz Luhrman's version of Romeo and Juliet. It was good not only in art direction, but in modernizing a masterpiece as well. Luhrman did Not live up to his potential.</fullReview>

Man has walked on the moon, Concorde was able to break the speed of sound and the car has brought greater degrees of mobility to billions. How then can mankind have conspired to produce this film. It is so unforgivably tedious that those responsible for it should be charged with crimes against humanity. It's that bad! The endless song and dance routines sap the very life out of you. So over-the-top is the acting that one feels urges to unleash shotgun justice on all the participants immediately. All of the major characters are outrageously annoying, all of the minor characters invite your derision. The songs are appalling, but in the worst possible way. They stay in your mind and poison your sleep. You hum the tunes for days afterwards vainly hoping to forget their sheer banality! I cannot emphasise enough how bad this film is. Jim Broadbent is a fine actor, but he should hang his head in shame for starring in this sorry rubbish. To anybody with even an ounce of common sense regarding their film tastes, do not watch this movie! It will haunt you for days! This film has probably driven fathers to drink, their marriages have collapsed, their kids have turned to crime, people have been murdered and all because of this horrific offering. Moulin Rouge is probably the worst film ever made in terms of how much it will bore you to tears. Avoid it like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge! has cemented itself as one of my most cherished movies of all time. It was the first film that made me cry, and that's saying something since very few movies have done this.We are introduced to Paris at the start of the 20th Century. The bohemian spirit is alive and well, so a young English man traveling from London named Christian, decides to get involved in this movement. Upon meeting a group of misfits, lead by Toulouse-Latrec, Christian is set up as the writer of a new play that will embody the values of the bohemians: Truth, Beauty, Freedom and above all Love. He ends up falling for Satine, a beautiful courtesan that sells her love. Trouble arises when the play's investor, The Duke, is also enchanted by Satine. What follows is a tale of despair and heartbreak that will showcase a full range of emotions.What gets to me most in this movie, are the musical numbers which are mostly well sung and choreographed. From the wonderful Your Song to the magical Elephant Love Medley, and from the beautiful Come What May to the daring El Tango De Roxanne, everything falls into place in a wonderful production work. It also helps that the movie is extremely well acted and the cast's strenght help the message get across.Moulin Rouge! is by no means a perfect movie. No movie is, at least in not in the sense that everyone is fully pleased, and despite my feelings towards it, I too recognize the flaws. Still no movie pulls me into the fantastic world that is cinema quite like Moulin Rouge! . That for me is worth every penny.Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous sights and sounds at the Moulin Rouge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christian and Satine fall in love and what a great love story it could be. Except this love, as the film tells us right at the very beginning, is doomed. So there could be a touch of melancholy to this whole film. But director Baz Luhrmann blows you away with the sights, the sounds, the frantic energy of the Moulin Rouge. How can you be feeling glum when you're having so much fun? This film draws you in and never lets you go. Yes, the singing and dancing are quite good fun. But there is that captivating love story too. We know there will be no happily ever afters. But we love Christian and Satine just as they love one another. You can't help but be charmed by this couple. And while giving you such a lovely couple to root for the film also gives you a dastardly villain to root against. The Duke, rich and powerful, wants Satine. But her heart belongs to Christian. The Duke does not like this. Not one little bit. Complications ensue.Initially Satine's heart does not belong to anyone. She does not feel she is free to love anyone. She's the star attraction at the famed Paris cabaret Moulin Rouge. She's a singer, a dancer...and a courtesan, which is a fancy word for prostitute. When the owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler, needs someone to finance the club's new show Satine knows what she must do. She will make the Duke believe she loves him so he will finance the show. And this arrangement is not without benefit to Satine, this new show will perhaps give her a chance to be a real actress. But there's a little mix-up. She comes to believe that Christian, a penniless writer, is actually the Duke. By the time she realizes her mistake Christian is already totally smitten with her. And then the real Duke shows up and things could get really messy. But a song and dance number saves the day. In this movie, when in doubt, a song and dance number is always the answer.So the Duke ends up agreeing to pay for the show, which Christian will be writing. Of course Christian is much more interested in Satine than he is in the show. Eventually, through song of course, he will win her heart. Then it's a matter of keeping their love hidden away from the oblivious Duke. Satine starts spending all her time with Christian. For the good of the show you see. A girl's gotta rehearse, right? Wink, wink. This makes for a rather unhappy Duke and a very nervous Zidler who needs to keep the man with the money on board. Meanwhile, lurking in the background there is that knowledge that there will be no happy ending. The whole film is in essence told in flashback, Christian in 1900 telling us of the events which happened a year earlier. The Christian of 1900 is a completely heartbroken man, the movie tells us how he got to such a state. What had become of his beloved Satine?Right from the start director Luhrmann lets us know this film is going to be a little bit different. The film's events may unfold in 1899 but the songs Luhrmann uses are not of that period, it's a contemporary soundtrack. When Christian breaks out into some Sound of Music you think that's interesting. When you then hear a little Smells Like Teen Spirit it becomes clear that absolutely anything goes in this film. And all these songs which would seem to be so out of place work so perfectly. Some, such as Satine's renditions of Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend and Material Girl, are so fitting they may as well have been written for this film. Other songs are a bit more of a stretch but Luhrmann makes it all work. And as much as Luhrmann it is the cast who make it work, most notably Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman playing Christian and Satine. Their acting is wonderful and their singing is strong and convincing. And needless to say they look the part as well. McGregor has an air of innocence and immense likability. And it is certainly easy to buy into the breathtaking Kidman as the woman who makes Paris's collective heart race. Jim Broadbent is also notably excellent as Zidler and he gets the film's funniest musical number as well.This is a film with constant energy to it, full of life. It's a bit of a sensory overload. The costumes and color make for a visual feast. The songs are performed wonderfully, the dances are beautifully choreographed. The movie hardly ever stops to take a breath, it's constant motion. There are some moments where you wonder if the tone is quite right. The aforementioned Broadbent number is indeed funny but coming as the film takes a darker turn it seems a touch out of place. And then there are moments where maybe it gets a little too dark, where the Duke goes off the deep end and becomes too evil to take seriously. Yes, he needed to be the bad guy but not that bad. But these are small quibbles. All in all the film is a lot of fun. The story is engaging, the performances are terrific and the music kicks things up to a whole other level. You have your touching love songs and you have your wild, loud dance explosions. Every song, every snippet, serves a purpose. The film is somewhat over the top but gleefully so. It makes for great entertainment. Very fitting that the title of the show Christian is writing is Spectacular Spectacular. Moulin Rouge! is spectacular indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating musical retelling of a familiar story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge's plot - beautiful young actress falls in love with impoverished writer but is compelled to be with wealthy patron - is nothing unfamiliar. But the music which the story is set to is excellent; think modern-day love songs transported to 19th-century Paris. The sets and costumes and dance routines were a feast for the eyes. And Nicole Kidman was brilliant as Satine; cold and hardened by the realities of the world, but tantalising and genuine as Christian's lover. While her falling for him seemed a bit too sudden, it was believable enough in the musical context. The movie isn't thought-provoking if you've been exposed to similar stories, but it is certainly high in artistic and entertainment value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colorful, musical and spellbinding!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a serious fan of musicals, but this movie is one of a few exceptions, a fascinating story where, in 1900 Paris, Poet Christian (Ewan McGregor) falls for beautiful courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman), a dancer at the nightclub Moulin Rouge, whose love affair is irked by the jealous Duke (Richard Roxburgh).Though set in 1900, modern era music is incorporated in the film and is spectacular to listen to. The costume and set designs were extremely colorful and vibrant, making the entire stage come to life with the cast of characters' brilliant dance sequences; Kidman especially gave a spellbinding and mesmerizing performance as Satine.The love affair between Christian and Satine is heartfelt and gave the film a nice touch of drama and romance, which I didn't find too sappy at all, just the right amount to touch the hearts of the audience. In addition, the acting of the rest of the cast of characters were unique and passionate, contributing to the music, love, sadness and comic relief genres that surround the entire plot. Director Baz Luhrmann did a good job guiding the cast and incorporating so many dramatic and colorful elements into the movie. Overall, it's an enchanting movie to watch - not your typical romance flick or musical film.Grade B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite original movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, at first I can say that I expected a little bit different movie. But this took my breath away. It is a story about beautiful, all bridging love. The main actors were extremely good, they act pure love and I believe in them. But there was one negative thing. The knowing that Satine will die in the end. It took control of my mind and I could not empathize to characters' love, because every time then the things went a little bit wrong I expected Satine's tragic die. Nonetheless, the film was a truly original. It was fun to recognize really popular songs like "Your song", "Show must go on" and others. Some people can be a little angry, because they so loved songs were adopted to cabaret style music, but this is the main reason why this movie shows so interesting and different from other movies. Also, the mix of show and real characters' life took a huge enough part of this movie's exclusivity. I some words, I give 10 to this movie, because of inspiring love story and originals decisions.</fullReview>

It made me smile, it made me cry, i enjoyed the singing and the songs, i enjoyed the story. I thought each part was well acted. Ewan and Nicole are amazing anyway but in this film they show their acting skills and their singing skills, yes Nicole is a better singer than Ewan but they are still both good. I can't really fault the film much, bits where a bit too dramatic and far fetched but it made no difference to me as the storyline made up for it.I think 8 out of 10 is a good rating as there is always room for improvement but i would definitely recommend to people who like the typical romantic musical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect as a film can get</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann masterpiece's 'Moulin Rouge' falls into the very definition of a masterpiece. Not only because it's like one of the greatest films ever made, but mainly because of its inimitable uniqueness for anyone, but the originator of the work, that obviously know the formula of his films. Few times i've seen in fact a film so great and peculiar to the point that it simply can't be reproduced. The style, the use of modern music in a period film, the crazy and stunning editing, and the colorful art direction and the excellent acting by both leads and also by the supporting actors are remarkable in this film. Again, never seen nothing like that before. The story may sound cliché, as the old Shakeaperian romance tale, but it simply don't matters in the end. What matters is the way its told here, in an entertaining and highly artistic way. Nicole Kidman is in one of his career-best performances in Moulin Rouge. Ewan McGregor also does well, but what really does even better than act is sing! His very first musical part is the best of the entire film in my opinion.The cinematography is fantastic, and there are tons of references to films of the early 20th century, all made for a comedic but conscious purpose. The scene when the lovers warmly embrace, there is a curtain in the shape of heart right behind them background can be seen the curtain in the shape of heart, doing a suggestive outline around them.Highly recommended and absolutely one of the best films i've seen. 9.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the weirdest, most random, messed up and hallucination inducing film i have ever seen, but seeing how none of these were accidental and all were deliberate, i can't help but like it.first, i think it's safe to say i suspect Baz Luhrmann is a heavy user of acid, but i digress. the acting is nicely over the top, the cinematography is good and over the top, the writing is both intriguing and hilarious... and over the top, the songs were worked into the film fairly well and what would a film be, with so many over the top elements, without an over the top story. in my opinion, this a drug hallucination, and seeing as the only apparent goal here was to be obnoxious, fanatic, fast, unrelenting and crazy, i think it succeeds for what it is. if you don't like musicals then stay away, but if you're in the mood for a trip without actually taking drugs, you should try it, same if you like romances or films that do not take themselves seriously at all.now, i've heard people call this film pretentious, tell me, what exactly is being pretentious? according to the dictionary, pretentious means to act more important than you really are, people seem to label a lot of films with artistic intentions or a director who has a very noticeable visual style with the word pretentious and thinking about it, it doesn't make much sense. if someone sees something on screen they believe is only there because the director really wanted it, they immediately get angry for some reason and dismiss it as being "pretentious", imagine if you were walking down the street and someone said you were being pretentious because you were wearing a tie.we cannot assume a film or director is narcissistic just because we can see something the director obviously really wanted, pretty much everything we see in every movie is how the director wanted it, but when we notice, we immediately get nasty. a person does not think a film is more important than it is just because the director's style is a bit noticeable this time. even if a film is being pretentious, what's wrong with that? what damage does it do to the audience apart from ignite negative reactions from people who probably went into the theatre hoping to hate it before hand, or those who think if they find a film, that was supposed to be slow for example, boring, then everybody must hate it because they say so.so what if this film has a strong style, if you didn't like the use of style, then fine, just don't claim that your personal pet peeves are a problem for everyone else.</fullReview>

I did not like male main actor and the Duke in terms of their acting. Nicole Kidman was amazing and it is hard to believe that she has broken ribs etc and is on wheelchair in many of the scenes.

		<fullReview>It only had one fault ... advertising! I never saw any advertising for this movie, and I was living in Hollywood at the time! I saw the posters at Hollywood &amp; Franklin ... but the posters gave no information what-so-ever, just some piece of artwork that really did not register in my brain! This is a movie I would have been thrilled to see at a theater.Nicole Kidman ... as much as a favorite as any of the classic actresses, such as Rita Hayworth, Ann-Margret, and, last but certainly not least ... Marilyn Monroe. As a matter of fact, I firmly believe that Nicole is Marilyn reincarnated ... all you have to do is look into those eyes and see Marilyn shining through! A very clever woman ... the part she plays is a little bit Ann-Margret, some Nicole, and a whole lot of Marilyn ... right down to her opening number and costume. You may find it interesting that her name in Happy Feet was Norma Jeane! Plus chosen by Chanel to be their Chanel Girl for a time! Nicole is also a Gemini, as was Marilyn. By the way, Marilyn's voice comes out quite clearly in the bomb ... "Bewitched!" I have not had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Kidman, but I sure hope that changes one day! The casting in this movie was Spectacular Spectacular and the movie has already become a Classic! By the way, I'm so surprised that John Leguizamo did not win an Oscar for his role in this film, as well as his role in "To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar", this is one heck of an actor that should stand proudly next to another great actor ... Johnny Depp! I see them as equals! As a footnote ... I hated the number "Like a Virgin!" Without that number I would have given this a 10 star rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As usual Baz Luhrmann has provided us with a masterpiece, a movie that will make you laugh, dance and cry. Whilst I can understand this not being everyones taste it certainly appealed to the artist in me with its combination of film and theater, and of course a story line about a bunch of struggling bohemian artists trying to make it big. The story line consists of Christian (Ewan McGregor) moving to Paris to pursue his obsession with love and the bohemian lifestyle, and much to his surprise being dragged into writing a play with a bunch of struggling artists. On his first visit to the Moulin Rouge he meets Satine (Nicole Kidman) and sparks fly! The 2 actors have a magical on stage connection that makes the entire movie seem so real, they really make you believe they are madly in love, I sometimes felt like I was inside the story line rather than just watching it, its so easy to get lost in! As is normal with Luhrman the movie is quite fast paced, brightly coloured, the sets are surreal and the acting is highly over the top, all of it making you feel as if you are at the Theatre. A lot of people don't like the fact that original songs weren't written for it but I absolutely loved the song choices, they were quite familiar which allows you to sing along on your first viewing of the film! With such a fast paced, bright, trippy movie we expect a happy ending were the lovers get married and live happily ever after, sadly this isn't so, throughout the film you will notice it get gradually darker and darker, and the ending hit me so hard that I was crying for an hour afterwords! This film is definitely worth a watch, and I know I will watch it again and again and again! If you like art and excitement and creativity, watch it. If you like logic, realistic acting and are strictly against cheesy music then stay away!</fullReview>

Ewan McGregor really surprised me. I never knew he could sing, and he was really good. All that I didn't like was the end, it was so tragic...I loved every minute of the Moulin Rouge! not once was I bored or even asleep.

		<shortDescription>The story of a two lovers, of totally different characters fighting for their dream in the world of the Moulin Rouge.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is something like steamroller of emotion and visuals that lifts you into the sky, and keeps rising. While neither the story or the characters are anything original, the film succeeds because of how well it presents them. The world that they live in is painted in a way that the characters seem real and not the stereotypes that we would otherwise see them as. What make this film great is that the story that seems so boring and predictable is taken beyond its natural borders to create something spectacular, overwhelming, and, despite or maybe partly because of the glamor, touching. The movie is a treat for the eyes and a message to the heart. It is neither a overly glitzy film or a soppy one. It combines the glamor of the Moulin Rouge and the simple love of young idealist. The acting/singing of Kidman and McGregor was excellent, and the supporting roles avoided being 2D, with some I feel like I want to know more about them. The music overall was great, for example: my favorite, the scene where Roxane was sung, was something breathtaking, that I re watched twice before I went on.Overall i would say this film is a must see, something special among all the Hollywood stuff turned out nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it is an amazing film! It is not only a very romantic and lovely story, but the whole concept is so original. First of all, I really like the leading actors. Nicola Kidman and Ewan McGregor play their parts perfectly. Because it is a musical, it is standard that there are a lot of songs. When I first heard the songs, I immediately searched them on the internet and listened to them time after time. The music is powerful and has a recognizable beat, but you also have the more quiet and emotional songs. At the beginning, my opinion about the film in general was rather vague because there were strange scenes in it. But after watching it several times, I still love it. A next incredible fact about the film is the decor! It all seems fantastic. You would think the Moulin Rouge is a magic places with shows, drinks and a lot of dancers. But you still know exactly that everything is happening in Paris. The shocking side about this item is that the film wasn't made in Paris at all. Nothing you see about Paris, the buildings, the Moulin rouge itself, is real. I think it's a piece of art. This film is the reason why I like everything about the Moulin rouge. I'm fascinated about it.Therefore I strongly recommend this film, The Moulin Rouge!, to everybody I know!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dazzling Film That Can Irritate Or Amaze, Entertain or Repel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By reading all the varied opinions of the effect this film has on viewers, one can easily deduce it's power to attract or repel, depending on the viewer's cultural background--do you want a film that pushes the envelope or a more traditional take, well-made but linear? Moulin Rouge is in no way traditional, and therein lies it's strength for many viewers, perhaps especially for those raised on television commercials and the toys of instant communication, where a frequent change of focus is stimulating rather than irritating.As with Director Luhrmann's recent Gatsby film, the style here is the primary substance, a delirious mix of color, sound and attitude in brilliant color that never lets a moment go by without a camera zoom or background flourish; the first time I watched this strange amalgam of red and gold curtained style, I was ready for a Tylenol, mainly because I wanted some sort of coherent plot, some feeling to hang on to--every time Luhrmann hooks the viewer into an emotional moment, he whips it into something else entirely, like throwing 237 vivid MTV shorts into a blender and churning it on crumble: the second time I watched it merely for the sensual thrills (as the plot is high-school simple) and enjoyed the ride. There is little doubt that Luhrmann is able to make a dazzling film, but whether he delivers any kind of depth in human relationships or feeling is another matter entirely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that left me with very mixed feelings about the concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat down to watch this movie with very mixed feelings about it, and found that ambivalence intensified by the end of the movie.I'm aware that a lot of the way I felt about "Moulin Rouge" is because of a very personal feeling I have about what a musical movie should be, and that isn't entirely fair to the movie. Take this warning for what it's worth.On a pure entertainment level, "Moulin Rouge" provides some shiny sparkly fun diversion. It's the story of a singer/dancer/courtesan, Satine (Nicole Kidman), who is the star attraction at the Moulin Rouge cabaret in Paris during the belle epoque, which was about the late 1880's through to the start of the first World War.This is the Paris of Comte Henri de Tolouse-Lautrec, who is played in the movie by Jim Broadbent, and it is a decadent period where cynicism and grasping materialism collide head-on with the dreams, now possible, of upward mobility through the burgeoning entertainment/arts industry. A singer, a dancer, a writer, an artist (or artiste), an impresario could become a major player in society. All that was required was talent and the will to make the grab for the brass ring when the merry-go-round spun you into its path.The bare bones of the plot involves the romance of Satine with a penniless writer, Christian (Ewan McGregor), while Satine tries to seduce a rich rich rich nobleman, known only as "the Duke" (Richard Roxburgh) so he'll finance a show for her at the Moulin Rouge cabaret. The Duke wants to possess Satine; Christian wants to love her; and Satine, who has tuberculosis and is doomed, waivers between going for the love (Christian) and going for the undying fame and fortune (the Duke and the starring role in the show he'll finance for her).Where the movie goes wrong for me is in setting all of the plot and action to a contemporary soundtrack, featuring songs like "Lady Marmalade" sung by Christina Aguilera, "Diamond Dogs" by Beck, "Nature Boy" by David Bowie, and Kidman and McGregor covering songs like "Sparkling Diamonds" and "Our Song".It's not that McGregor and Kidman do a bad job of singing, or that the songs chosen are themselves inappropriate or badly done. And it's not that the action and dancing that accompanies the songs is wrong or badly done. It's just that the use of the contemporary songs that are well-known and hits in their own right gives a sense of being a bunch of music videos cobbled together to make a movie. For me it just didn't feel right: it didn't feel original. It felt commercial, and it made me feel betrayed, as if by ponying up my dollars for admission I was just buying a slick packaged product, not viewing an original work of art.And that's where I have the problem with this movie. But setting aside my personal feelings, I'm not going to tell you that this movie is a waste of time, far from it. While the plot of the doomed courtesan having to choose between true love and commercial success is an old story, it's very well told in this movie, in an entertaining way, with some very talented people doing a good job. As pure entertainment it can work very well.I hate to use the term "chick flick," but I do believe that this is a movie that will appeal to women far more than to men, although guys should take note that this would be a really great "date movie." But the costumes, the dancing and the plot will not appeal to those who are looking for an action movie towards the testosterone end of the spectrum.I'm not going to tell people looking for a fun movie to watch to avoid "Moulin Rouge," because it is a fun movie to watch. But for people who wonder why I rated this movie relatively low, I'll just say this: watch a really original musical movie like "Oliver!", or one of the older classics like "West Side Story" or "South Pacific," and see if that makes you wonder what "Moulin Rouge" might have been if someone with talent and vision had tried to make a really original musical, instead of grabbing a bunch of contemporary hit songs and building a musical around them. Maybe if that had been done, we'd have a really GREAT movie, instead of a movie that's good commercial entertainment without the spark of originality that sets great art apart from merely successful art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mostly, I don't like musicals. The reasons being, it's not really a movie. However else fantastical the premise gets - I'm usually OK with that. Scifi, art-house, animation (dah!?), fantasy(up to a point), serial killer, comedy, and romantic comedies even.For me, musicals belongs to the stage. Cause people just don't break out in a song and dance. But this somehow works for me. Mostly because of the set, costume design and the swirling CGI.It works in that is it acceptable. The 8 is in relation to other movies - musical unbiased removed. Contrivices aside - the ridiculous love story, the insidious plot, the terminal illness...etc.Why? since all these are NORMAL within melodramas. So the argument is I'd rather watch these factors in a short 2.5hr musical with relatively young starts (Ewan and Nicole) ...with good choreography, lighting and cutting... than in 20 years of still camera shots in 'Days of our Lives'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I mean the show will be magnificent, opulent, tremendous, stupendous, gargantuan bedazzlement! A sensual ravishment. It will be...Spectacular Spectacular!"I thought the first half of Moulin Rouge was spectacular. Beyond spectacular. Grand, sexy, bright, colorful, manic, clever, sumptuous, lavish, and endlessly amusing. Kidman was wonderful, the songs and performances grab you and don't let go, and I was just intensely interested by it all. It was the kind of start that anyone who enjoys a fun movie would find irresistible.The second half, however, cooled my ardor a bit. The story takes a turn for the more serious and tragically romantic. The liveliness was replaced with sadness, the fun was supplanted with the dour, and Nicole Kidman was tragically over-dressed. I'm not claiming that these aspects of the movie were flaws (except Nicole Kidman not being half-naked anymore), but they didn't appeal to me as much as what came before. I found myself losing interest somewhat.So my score is an average of a stellar first half and a disappointing (for me) finale. Depending on your preference for the melodramatic, you may not share my reservations. Regardless, this is a movie that anyone with even a passing fondness for musicals must see. It's a glorious experience, even if it's an uneven one.</fullReview>

What I didn't like about this movie was the ending, but I suppose that a "happily ever after" would've been cliché.A Walk to Remember shares many things in common with Moulin Rouge, but they also have differences. They both share sad endings and are love stories. However, Moulin Rouge has more genres entwined within the story than A Walk to Remember does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paris, the Summer of Love, 1899: a penniles writer (Ewan McGregor) falls for a beautiful nightclub courtesan (Nicole Kidman).Moulin Rouge! is a post-modern musical in which deconstructing the form subtracts more than it adds: the pop cover versions sounded better in their original versions, while relentless editing reduces the film to visual confetti; on its release in September 2001, many viewers did, however, take refuge in its camp humour, hokey, insincere romance, and dazzling costumes and sets. The film was nominated for eight Oscars, including Best Picture, and won two: for art direction and costume design.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw many people's complaints about corny story and fast-pace camera shot. First I admit the story is really old and been done many times. If you want to pick an absolutely ORIGINAL, its impossible. Everything must come from somewhere. I felt the director is very clever to choose such an old familiar story and twist it so the element of surprise will be greater. The camera work is stunning. I never like MTV stuffs to be clear. But come on! This better than MTV. The camera work is fast just to show the frantic environment of Moulin Rogue. This is my first time compel to post comment because I feel a lot of the reviewer here doesn't do this film justice. It is one of the best movie. I swear! Don't listen to the naysayer and just enjoy the genius of this 21th century musical!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge! {Dir. Baz Luhrmann, 2001}****/****While he may not be the next Kubrick, it hard to deny that director Baz Luhrmann is an exceedingly capable showman. He throws as many striking images on the screen as an audience can handle; sometimes at expense of story and character. Here, Luhrmann achieves what some may have thought impossible: constant cinematic exhilaration. While he has many weaknesses as a director, (namely his penchant toward melodrama and bombast) all of his cinematic traits meld together here to form a masterpiece that is essentially a glorious mish-mash of all aspects of 20-th century culture. Here you have the elements of classical opera, early stage melodrama, swooning love songs and the incessantly moving camera that seems to guide the MTV-generation through life put into a blender. While every inclination I have would regard this premise with hesitation, the result is positively intoxicating. A miracle of a movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really hope that you reading this because you have not seen Moulin Rouge - and I wish I was in that position. Let me explain why.Do you know what I mean when I say there are some movies that just knock you backwards with delight and surprise the first time you see them. The impact is even more powerful if you don't know anything about the film before you sit down to watch it. Well, for me, Moulin Rouge is just such a movie, and a great example of entertaining cinematography at its very best. I'm not going to say anything about the plot; nor am I going to give you any clue as to what journey of delight the director will lead you on. You will just have to read these few key words and see if you like the idea in general: love, Paris, jealousy, words, theater, Sound of Music, tragedy, humor, an elephant, dance, a Duke, music and colors.So? What do you think? Willing to give it a try? But be warned: there's no action scenes; no exciting shoot out; no cops; no mafia, no car chase and no blood and guts. Boring you may say? Well if that lot is a must for any movie you watch then you can forget Moulin Rouge.Still interested? Great. Go away, find the DVD or download it, and get ready for a delightful couple of hours.This is a film that many consider a 'cult movie' of a kind. It might not be a perfect, clinical production but I promise you that all its flaws just add to the charm. There is a very good chance you will want to see it over and over so as to catch the myriad points of detailed set design and actions by the supporting cast. And the music is great. It shows what two 'non-singer' actors can do in very demanding musical roles. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGegor are both fantastic.Oh, yes, a word of warning: don't be scared off by the first 10 minutes - trust the director. He will make it all come clear.This is in my Top 20 movies ever! Just sit back and 'On with the show'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but it sure as hell wasn't this! I loved Luhrman's ""Strictly Ballroom" but after seeing "Moulin Rouge," the word talent doesn't begin to sum up what this man can do. Absolutely fresh, exciting, colorful, fast, brilliant, fiery, sweet, gorgeous, funny, original - I'm still stunned from the visual impact and the use of the anachronistic music in this film.A total knockout in every way. I recently saw John Leguizamo interviewed. He said that he was scheduled to be in more numbers but - and I'm paraphrasing - Nicole Kidman kept knocking him over or vice versa - he was hilarious.Baz Luhrman pulled some opera elements into this, particularly Traviata - one of the scenes was right out of Traviata, in fact. I'd love to see him do a production of it. It would be phenomenal.The cast was wonderful, with Kidman and McGregor magnificently showcased - beautiful to look at, fine acting, good singing - they made a fantastic couple.I have one itty bitty criticism, but it's not enough to give such an original approach less than a 10. I would have loved some of the musical numbers to have been just a tiny bit slower. I realize today the style is more the fast cuts, but some of it was so beautiful, I would have loved to have lingered on some of the scenes a bit more.A sensational accomplishment. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's very rare for me to rate a movie 10/10. I usually give this only to movies which are almost flawless, and I haven't found many.This movie is perfect. There are few films you like or think OK, and there are ones you need to wonder at, if you'd have to achieve what they did, how could you do that? How did they do it? I think, this movie sets a standard no movie ever will repeat. The difference is there, in between, the difference which separates the professionals who are brilliant in their work, put everything they have, work hard and achieve great things, and the geniuses. This is something I couldn't imagine, couldn't invent. And I can only bow down with humility and thank the creators for the chance that I could see it.I feel it silly to list everything, to say it was great, because everything was great. Pacing, effects, music, acting, singing, editing, directing,... I would give an Oscar for everything there's one and for the rest I'd make new categories.Thank you Baz Luhrman. You made me feel richer inside.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely...Flawless and Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Consider a film that will stir your all feelings:Love,humor,happiness etc.Moulin Rouge is one of these rare films and it's not exploiting your feelings and abusing your senses.It's sometimes coming into such a moment that you are becoming disabled how to act cry,laugh or what?But this situation's main reason is perfect acting and harmony between Mcgregor and Kidman.Yes their performance is giving strength to each other's performance and this harmony is what making this film such a modern classic.Yes if we look as a musical film it's not actually putting music to the front but putting this love story to front and using music and songs to increase the effect of the film and becoming successful.In another words We can use drama as a genre for this film,because using music doesn't actually make a film musical,but this film can be put into a sub-genre and can be classified as musical-drama.But it has very big inspirations from musical atmosphere,all these funny and colorful world are main body of musical films.Luhrmann uses these both things(drama and musical)in a successful way.A beautiful lady(actually a bitch)sells his body till she sells her heart to a handsome and poor writer.Also this ironic side of story is enough for a musical-drama.But As a conclusion:Moulin Rouge is a very brilliantly made and harmonized film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is incredible. The actors, shots, script, music, everything. There isn't anyone who could of played Satine and Christian better than Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. I absolutely loved it. And because of it, i completely fell for Ewan McGregor! His character was adorable, and being able to sing that well just made him more irresistible! Nicole Kidman looked flawless throughout the entire movie and played her role to perfection. I thought the way they managed to make modern songs fit in so well in a film set in the 1900s was brilliant, and every lyric fit perfectly. El tango De Roxanne, the elephant love medley and come what may have got to be my favourite songs. the passion and emotions through el tango De Roxanne just sends shivers right through me, it was filmed amazingly. the facial expressions of the Argentinian, Nini and Christian tell a story in themselves. My favourite character has got to be Toulouse though. Even though Christian is gorgeous and Satine was amazing, Toulouse still managed to become my favourite! His accent, enthusiasm, and overall look was just brilliantly put together. One of the best films i have ever seen !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well filmed movie which is a little too frenetic for its own good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw Moulin Rouge in a college dorm, surrounded by easy-going fun-loving college students, and although they enjoyed the movie so much they could even sing along to the catchy tunes, there were certain things in the film that I was personally bothered by. The contemporary songs in the Bohemian Revival setting work very well for certain scenes, but some scenes, particularly the love scenes between Satine and Christian, would be much deeper and more emotional with conventional background music... The filming/shooting in this movie was refreshing, with camera angles everywhere and zooms all over the place. The effect is slightly overused in my opinion, but is in keeping with the overall "style" of the movie. Finally, the acting itself was not bad at all, with great acting and chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, and some fantastic secondary roles. Overall a good movie, but perhaps a little bit overdone, as I guess all musicals are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a few films that take movie-making to the pinnacle of artistic expression. Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane, From Here to Eternity... all have rendered themselves immortal. I have a gut feeling Moulin Rouge will soon join them.This film is not a depiction of realism. It is a depiction of love, a lush visual feast, and a treasure trove of two of the greatest acting performances of all time. Nicole Kidman gives all she has as Satine, the disillusioned courtesan who learns to love and wants only to be 'a real actress' and Ewan MacGregor is Oscar-worthy as her love, Christian the writer, who writes a musical using their story. His sobbing scene at the end alone should have won him an Academy Award. Their duets are heart-throbbing, their chemistry makes the atomic bomb look like a sparkler, and the secret glances they share have us all rooting for them. Their love is a story for all the ages.This movie is not, nor does it set out to be, an accurate depiction of history. You want that, find documentaries, not a Hollywood movie. This movie was created to teach us a lesson. And, with stunning sets, lavish costumes, and the voices of angels, it does exactly that. This movie really does depict love as it should be... and as it can be. This is passion, fire, souls mating, single-minded, eternal love - and nothing is better than that.I cannot find the words to express what this movie is. It is not in any way conventional, nor is it in any way original. But this is a fantastical blending of tales old as time and gorgeous 80's music to create the ultimate lesson: "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is one of those movies that depend on style over substance. It is very simply a love story that has been told many times over, and throws no fresh light on said love story and provides no original insight. It has not much to do with the actual club Moulin Rouge, which serves simply as a setting for the love story the movie centers on, with a few characters drawn from history (such as the "dwarf" Toulouse-Lautrec) and thrown in for comical effect.That being said, the sets and costumes and saturated colors in the movie are very appealing to the eye and, combined with the rather touching romance between Satine and Christian (interesting choice of names, by the way...) and quirkiness of the characters and dance numbers, are enough to hold your attention, especially once the movie gains momentum (it comes off rather strange and random at first and takes some settling into). Nicole Kidman is, of course, dazzling in the role of the sultry Satine, and her voice is quite good. Ewan McGregor's, while not as melodic as Kidman's, is good enough to serve the movie's purposes, and I'm sure a great many women have swooned/will swoon over his character. It is impossible not to be warmed at least a little by the two's secret love, although I was not quite sure why they fell in love in the first place...The dance numbers that are drawn from an amalgamated variety of modern songs are rather tacky but manage to work (some of them are barely pulled off, in my mind, and some are quite good). "Roxanne" is definitely my favorite in the movie (as many people will agree), probably because it's in the more conventional and serious style of musical numbers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicole could sing... Ewan shouted. Nevertheless, with Moulin Rouge Baz Luhrmann delivered another visually stunning film, similar in style to Romeo and Juliet. I like this pop culture take on the musical. Hollywood just doesn't make musicals anymore, and its interesting that this one was shot entirely in Australia. Moulin Rouge is unusual. The leads give their best, the supporting cast is great and I quite liked the music. However, in saturating the film in song, Luhrmann doesn't really let the characters develop. Moulin Rouge looks pretty and is certainly different. I did just buy the 2 disc DVD and the extras are great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cinematic Equivalent of a Migraine Attack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How's this for an original plot? A beautiful but consumptive Parisian courtesan finds true unselfish love with an idealistic young man. I can't think where I've heard that one before. 'Moulin Rouge!' is set in the famous nightclub in 1899/1900. Christian, an aspiring young English writer falls in love with Satine, a courtesan who is also the Moulin Rouge's most famous dancer. (Just how she manages to dance so energetically even though she is dying of consumption is never explained). Christian has a rival for Satine's affections in the shape of an evil but immensely wealthy Duke. Anyone who has read 'La Dame aux Camellias' can work out the rest. The film is not intended to be a period piece or an attempt to recreate the atmosphere of fin-de-siecle Paris. Although the era had its own very distinctive musical culture, some of which is still familiar today thanks to films such as 'Can-Can' or the original 'Moulin Rouge' from the fifties, Baz Luhrmann took the decision to ignore this, using modern pop music instead, so we get the characters singing along to the likes of 'One Day I'll Fly Away', Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' or David Bowie's 'Diamond Dogs'. The idea was presumably to make something unorthodox and to get away from the traditional Hollywood musical. While I can appreciate Luhrmann's ambition to try something unconventional, I did not appreciate the result. Both Nicole Kidman as Satine and Ewan McGregor as Christian did their own singing, but although Kidman's voice is pleasant enough I felt that neither of them have strong enough singing voices to take the leading roles in a film musical. The old system whereby professional singers were often hired to dub the voices of star-name actors had a lot to be said for it. The set-piece choral numbers, by contrast, tended to sound harsh and strident. If the film sounded bad, it looked even worse. The sets and costumes looked cheap and tacky, the colours were garish and the camera-work must have been done by someone on an acid trip. Ditto the editing. The acting is defiantly and quite deliberately over the top, the worst offender being Jim Broadbent whose performance as Harold Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge, must rate as one of the most manic displays of overacting ever seen. Kidman and McGregor are only slightly better; I was left quite unmoved by the pathos of the young lovers' plight. With its strident music, garish colours and hectic visuals, this film is the cinematic equivalent of a migraine attack. Those who see it as a triumph of style over substance are being too charitable. Certainly, there is little substance here, but nobody could call this loud, vulgar, tasteless and self-satisfied film stylish except those who confuse tawdry glitz with style. 3/10. (To those who would say that this is a woman's picture that men cannot appreciate, I would reply that my wife scored it 0/10).</fullReview>

Although this film had spectacular lighting, good choreography and most of all, great talented acting, this film had no proper storyline. Although, Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman were the perfect people to act in this film, as they are both incredibly talented actors (ie.Singing and Dancing) I found this film completely fake and hollow. The reason why some people may enjoy this film is because they have mistaken this film for what they believe is sophisticated culture, but in actual fact, isn't.

"Moulin Rouge!" indulges in silly romantic cliches on purpose, because there seems to be some unwritten law that all musicals have to be superficial and shallow love stories. Shame it didn't really try to improve the formula. If you think that hearing someone croon "The greatest thing you'll ever learn...is to LOVE...and be LOVED...in RETURN!" is real deep and touching, then you might get something out of this.

		<shortDescription>The Most Overrated Film of the Decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baz Luhrman's frenetic "Moulin Rouge!" is one of those films that people either love or hate. I have to go with the latter. This is the epitome of a generation of MTV-style filmmaking: the movie is little more than one long, exhausting music video. There is very little substance amongst all the stylistic excess. The characters are all cartoonish stereotypes and the plot is formulaic. The comedic aspects of the film are very broad and not very funny. I found John Leguizamo's portrayal of diminutive painter Toulouse Latrec particularly annoying. The film's message is basically about the power of love (or "wuv", as half the characters in the movie seem to pronounce it), but the love portrayed here is shallow.There is no subtlety or pacing in this film. Everything is done to the extreme. "Moulin Rouge!" could be diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. I became annoyed with the unnecessary camera movements and fast-paced editing. During one scene, I counted 45 cuts within one minute of screentime! Meanwhile, the soundtrack is a bizarre medley of modern pop/rock hits and songs from old movie musicals. This concept is novel, but the novelty soon wears off. While I must give a tip of the hat to any film that tries something different in this age of cinematic mediocrity, watching "Moulin Rouge!" is equivalent to eating cotton candy: it's colourful and gives you a quick buzz, but you soon get sick of it.Rating: ** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I needed a Dramamine to get through the first 10 minutes. Words cannot effectively express how much I despised this film. If you looked up "over rated" in the dictionary, there would most definitely be a foot note to direct you to "Moulin Rouge."**SPOILER ALERT** (not that the inception of this piece of garbage wasn't spoiling enough)A musical? Depends on your definition, I guess. Oh, sure...there's music. All your favorite songs from the '80s and '90s mixed in with weird colors, different lyrics, sloppy editing and goofy camera angles--complete with Nicole Kidman (completely out of her league, I might add).All the songs you've heard before, they just changed some of the lyrics around to make them fit whatever visual image they were striving for. Weird Al Yankovic has been doing this for ages, and I haven't heard him called a genius. No song or artist is safe: Nirvana, Madonna, Patti LaBelle, Sting--I must say, their use of "Roxanne" brought about a very audible and none to appreciative groan from the audience when I saw it.In fact, that's all this was really--one big long music video. There's a love story that ends tragically, but, that's neither original nor a surprise (Nicole Kidman's character starts out bleeding shortly after we meet her, and doesn't stop 'til she's kicked the bucket). I guess I was meant to care, but, since it was an good indicator that this crap was winding down, I found myself feeling more delighted than anything else.Kidman's voice has been computer enhanced out the wah-zoo, and it still sounds weak and airy. Ewan MacGregor doesn't have a bad voice, but, it's surrounded in mediocrity. John Leguizamo is there for comic relief as a dwarf, but it's as comically relieving as a nosy neighbor from some '70s sitcom that only lasted 1/2 a season. This movie had everything but a tap dancing zebra--and, I'm sure there's one of those hidden in a group shot somewhere.Teenie boppers will love it because "EWAN'S SO CUTE!" They'll also be amazed over the fact that "NICOLE SANG AND DANCED THROUGH THE WHOLE THINGS--THEN DIED AT THE END. THAT'S REALLY HARD, YOU KNOW?" Seeing this movie and appreciating musicals is like reading reading the Cliff Notes to "To Kill a Mocking Bird" and loving the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cottonne was the star of the Moulin Gris, they called her the Dull Pumice Stone...Either the film was boring or it irritated me with its weird camera direction. Some of the scenes were far too ridiculous, for example when Harry Zidler, Satine, Christian etc. presented "Spectacular, Spectacular" to the Duke and the cartoon sound effects were edited... But still, the acting was fine and the film came up with some quite cool and stylish ideas, like Satine descending on her swing from the ceiling or the Green Fairy's Dance.The film indeed has brilliant costumes and the songs were really good adapted (though I would have preferred original songs), but overall I missed a plot. Well, there actually was a plot, but I missed a clear line in the succession of the scenes, there were no particularly spectacular or dramatic scenes, the movie just went on and on and on... Some might say that this film doesn't need a story and that I should rather enjoy the music and the costumes, but it was just pointless.Go and see Chicago to experience true GLAM!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every so often something comes along, whether music or film, that takes an audience and polarizes them, to where they either love or hate the work completely. There is no middle ground. It's a rare phenomenon, but it happens. Here are some examples of what I mean. Prince. Tom Green. Howard Stern. Phish. Think about them. You either love or hate them. Nobody buys into any of these artists half-way. If you like what they do, you love them, and spend all your free time trying to convince your friends how great they are. I'm sure Prince is a genius, I'm glad you think so. I've heard it a million times. I can't stand him. That said...I don't fault Baz Luhrmann as a filmmaker, I have no hard feelings towards the guy. His films are just not for me. I've seen strictly ballroom and Romeo and juliet. I hated both. Like I said, his stuff is not for me. I saw this in the theatre when was released. I was so motion sick after ten minutes, I left the building and had to kill an hour and a half 'till my friends came out. Months later I watched a friends dvd and still had the same impressions of the movie (and yes I watched the whole film completely to the end, painfully)- First of, it is cut way too fast for a movie screen. Even a bit much for a tv screen- The contemperary music was really really irritating. A horrible device to express whatever Baz was trying to get across.- The film was a series of pointless scenes connected together with no pause for anyone not drinking a tanker of mountain dew to comprehend.I really hated this film. This was a beautiful film ruined by two major things. It should have been conceptualized without the horrible dimes-store covers of classic rock songs, and edited completely completely different.</fullReview>

A well constructed vision, but just too WHAM - in your FACE! - too overblown. I suppose that was the point of the whole thing, but it certainly gave me a headache much worse than the delightful Absinthe scene. The swooping camera shots made me delirious.

		<fullReview>To the film's credit, The musical medleys are inventive and well produced, even if the songs used have been played to exhaustion already (except for the aptly used "Children of the Revolution" by T-Rex--really rockin' song right there!). However, the story and sexual innuendos which drive the story were about as inventive as another "yo momma" joke.All of the cabaret scenes were sensational, which is cool, but I couldn't help but feel like they were only there to keep your attention from wandering away from the love story you've probably seen the likes of in a dozen other movies already.To top it all off, I couldn't stand how all the male characters in this movie threw Satine around like a bargaining chip. I know that's turn-of the century-Paris-reality, but I wish it hadn't been so glamourised. It'd have been nice to see more of that Revolution the "bohemian" characters were so jacked up about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bohemian. Ribald. This costume musical takes place in 1900 Paris. Two men, a young poet(Ewan McGregor) and a Duke(Richard Roxburgh), covet a beautiful chanteuse(Nicole Kidman). Two hours of dizzy break neck music in motion. This movie bears no relation to the many previous films set in the most famous Parisian nightclub, the Moulin Rouge. Miss Kidman is utterly seductive with looks to kill for. And to many a surprise, this fetching actress can actually sing. Two hours of McGregor is another story. Also in this colorful cast:John Leguizano, Jim Broadbent and Caroline O'Connor. Kylie Minogue plays The Green Fairy. Outstanding familiar music covering what seems the entire 20th century. For a total change of pace, check out the more sedate and classic MOULIN ROUGE(1952)starring Jose Ferrer and Zsa Zsa Gabor.</fullReview>

We couldn´t watch one minute longer because no doubt the good songs were so sweet that we felt more and more tired. The story is very disappointing and the roles were too silly for stars like Nicole Kidman. I don´t how this film could win so many prices. If you like musicals watch it.

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is visually stunning. The use of colors and lighting is unlike any other movie I've seen. Pop rock over the past two decades has been revamped, and is well suited to the scenes in which it is played. This is where my infatuation with the film ends.I watched Chicago last weekend, and was unable to peel my eyes from the screen. Moulin Rouge was a different story. The movie dragged heavily. I feel that all focus was placed on making the movie an audio/visual masterpiece, sacrificing a quality storyline. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor give good performances, but the plot failed to interest me the slightest bit. In my opinion, this a film that brings a unique concept to the table that critics immediately hail. I found it to be stimulating, but a waste of two hours at the same time.I gave the movie a 4/10 simply for the unique set, use of color, and the ingenuity in use of refurbished pop songs in an early 1900s Paris setting. As I stated in my summary line, I would not watch the movie again.</fullReview>

Of course, no one looks at the plot for this movie when there's all that music.. had I seen this in the theatre I'd totally have walked out. the whole level of maturity of everything going on just seemed way too toned down... the cartoon sound effects that happened all the time were picking at my nerves, ewan mcgregor's plastic smile and singing voice were bugging as well, just about every character in this movie is engineered to annoy, ya this movie was not for me. if you're looking for some deep thoughtful meaning, this movie is as far as you can get from that. if you want a trite love story and some redone music, come right over. i'd give this a 1 out of 10, but they put so much work in it that it must deserve a 4.

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge was a disappointment.A musical needs its own music. Not only did Moulin Rouge! fail in that, but the music it had was well-known prior to the movie and identified with a modern era.Indeed, each time the characters broke into song it yanked the viewer out of the 1899 setting of the movie. So well-known is the music that it seemed like even the most serious scenes were comedic, with the joke being the character partaking in anachronism.The costumes, however, were wonderful. They suck the viewer into the period and feel of the movie.Too bad the music causes the viewer "toulouse lautrec'' of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have absolutely no idea what everyone saw in this film... this thing was Oscar material?Okay, Nicole Kidman was good - very good, in fact. She was the only good thing about this movie... and she can indeed sing. She does indeed know how to act... even in an abortion like this.Ewan MacGregor... he may be the flavor of the year (from "Trainspotting" and "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"), but he doesn't add anything to this movie - anybody could have filled the role.As for the rest of the cast... the less said, the better.Let's talk about the camera work... I'm surprised that more theaters didn't report cases of sea sickness during this movie... while we're all used to (by now) all those hand-held cameras that jump around, this one jumps around so much that you don't even have time to identify the player that it is focused on. It zips all over the place like a demented hedgehog, denying you a point of view to anyone.Next, the music... musicals are supposed to have music - preferably original music, though theater shows such as "ABBA, the Musical" (or whatever it may be called) rely on previously published tunes - not cheap recordings from an oldies station. If they had actually done full songs, that would have been one thing... but just stealing lines from various pop songs of the last 30 years? Ridiculous. Not only did they use individual lines from pop songs of years gone by, but they used the same durn lines over and over and over again... nauseating.Nicole Kidman was good... as noted, she was the only saving grace of this movie - but only if you have a really desperate Nicole Kidman fix that you need to feed. She deserves an Oscar just for putting up with this poor plot (so very over-used) and direction. She's good... but this movie isn't. Save your money.I like musicals (to a certain extent), but I'm durned if I know what this was... 'musical' isn't a term that encompasses this abortion of the film-making world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could have been a love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: This commentary contains spoilers for "Moulin Rouge"."Moulin Rouge" is one of those films that one is not certain how to rate. While it is clever in concept and visually rich, the plot lacks substance, relying on a sugar-coated set of "true bohemian" tenants to tell what is essentially a hackneyed boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl story. It's also historically annoying, lousing up with its portrayal of the privileged fin-de-siecle artist Toulouse-Lautrec as a starving writer/performer, but succeeding with a number of coy David Bowie references.Yet its most frustrating aspect is its inability or refusal to create audience sympathy for Satine (played by Nicole Kidman), the actress-prostitute who abandons her credo of love for money only to have a fling with the poor poet Christian (played by Ewan McGregor). Certainly she is pretty, certainly she is sexy, but when she gives up all for love during a song montage, the audience doesn't yet have a real reason to care about her-we simply haven't had enough time alone with her away from the lights and color. Ewan McGregor is more successful as her lover, but he acted a much finer love affair with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in "Velvet Goldmine". Indeed, "Velvet Goldmine" is a good picture to measure "Moulin Rouge" against, since it too tells a splashy, sexy rock-and-roll love story, but manages to do it with sure style and real sentiment, things "Moulin Rouge" only grasps after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hated this movie from the beginning to the end! I tried to keep an open mind throughout the meaningless insertion of modern songs, which have no place in this movie! How are we supposed to "suspend our disbelief", as the filmmakers want us to do in order to put ourselves into this timeframe and truly enjoy and BELIEVE the plot, the characters, the dialogue.......when we are constantly bombarded with such a horrible and disbelieving soundtrack?Granted, Nicole Kidman looked gorgeous and has a nice singing voice, and Ewan MacGregor is easy on the eyes and ears, BUT I winced through the entire movie when it first came out on pay-per-view on my cable company! It was so bad, I demanded my money back! I couldn't stand to watch the entire thing.......I turned it off (to another channel) about halfway thru it! I have since watched (and tried to enjoy the second time around) this movie, but it still leaves the same impression with me.The basic story of love, truth, beauty, etc. is a solid base for a movie, but this was and still is, a very disappointing movie...on many levels. For those of you who loved it, more power to you! Different strokes for different folks! :-)From the looks of these reviews, there are many of us who hated it!

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile for McGregor &amp; Broadbent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw 'Romeo and Juliet' so had some sense of what Baz puts on a screen. For a lot of this movie, his style is appropriately over-the-top and gives the movie a ton of life. Then it drags some in the middle and at the end. The level of intensity could not, I guess, be maintained, so you are left with some forgettably overlong dance &amp; songs. 'Roxanne' took forever!I didn't enjoy Nicole as much I had hoped to. I can see why she didn't win Best Actress. Its not that there is anything wrong with her, but she's not sympathetic enough to make you respond to her plight as much as you could have. Jim Broadbent must have been really great in 'Iris', to have been nominated and won his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for that movie instead of this one. He's electrifying as the owner of the club who is also a thoughtless pimp. Seeing him do a cover of 'Like a Virgin' was a highlight for me. However, all good things emerge from Ewan McGregor's quantum leading man performance. He is emotional, he can sing like a bird, and he has the talent combined with the looks to make you love him like you are supposed to in the great tradition of Clark Gable, Gary Cooper and Cary Grant. His underacting is perfectly suited to the movie and did I mention he sings his knickers off? 6/10, all for Ewan's talent and charm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film should down in history as the complete example of form over substance. Although interesting to watch why someone wasted 4 years of his or her life on this film is a mystery. Baz keeps on about the story when of cause there isn't one - I suppose if he says it often enough he'll convince himself that there was one. One of his collaborators (or should that be partners in crime) said that the 'story' was decided by the songs that they could licence.Nicole Kidman looked just like Cyble Shepard from some musical she made in the 70's and the 'baddie' Richard Roxburgh was doing a Tim Brooke-Taylor impersonation (from the 'Goodies' and Willie Wonker) Jim Broadbent looked like the Gilbert character from Topsy-Turvy and the great McGregor just looked like he hadn't a clue why he had agreed to do the film.Upon saying that - the sets and costumes were great - but the cinematography... who can tell - as far as I could see there wasn't a shot longer than 20 seconds in a 2-hour film. That is even worse than that Bruce Willis thing about the asteroid. As for the F/x you can be the judge. I've seen better on a pop video - in fact that's what is, a 2-hour pop video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cinematography was spotless, and the visuals, although quick and headache inducing, were fabulous. But good FX do not a good movie make.Moulin Rouge is eye candy with no substance other than force fed cornball MTV fluff, with inane dialogue, dreadful performances (only John Leguizamo stands above the material), and is visual proof that Baz Luhrmann has his head in a fluffy fantasy world where good writing falters in the face of visual aesthetics.But, I enjoyed parts of the film. Once again, the visuals were pleasing, if a little pretentious. I also loved John Leguizamo as the little guy, proving he has what it takes to be a serious actor amidst shit fests like The Pest. But Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor were totally, off the wall awful. Kidman was great to look at, but let's face it folks, she couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag. McGregor is a talented actor, and has the ability to choose interesting roles. He was out of his league here.The predictable script doesn't help matters. We know Kidman is doomed. Cough, gag. For a film that nearly modernizes 19th and early 20th century Paris, it makes you wonder why none of the clueless characters could have picked up on her ailing. I mean, they did somehow manage to get high tech surround sound in the theatres and through the music... Why not modern medicine? That's right - then she would have lived and the story wouldn't have the tug at the heart strings ending. Yawn.I suppose Moulin Rouge is what it is. I imagine it'll be Baz Luhrmann's one and only swan song in the field of entertainment, and I imagine every 15 year old girl with an itch for schmaltzy sap fests will purchase the extravagant DVD... But, I suppose I'll just forget the film, as should any intelligent movie goer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoy experimental filmmaking, so this caught my attention when a friend showed it to me. Having seen a can-can performance at the REAL Moulin Rouge, I can honestly say that this film does not do it justice. For any fans of this movie, I suggest seeing the real thing, then your regard for this film might falter.But back to the film . . .Visually it's eye-candy. It does a nice job of representing the world as a stage, but it looks too much like an MTV music video. Please note that this does NOT hurt the film - it simply makes it difficult to watch - like watching the epilepsy enducing visuals of Pokemon. Just be warned.The songs are fun - that's what I really enjoyed about this film. What better way to update the movie musical than by using POPULAR songs? And the way the film incorporates the songs really works. It's humorous and uplifting to hear them in the context of the story. (The Beatles' "All You Need is Love." is a subtle, yet strong example.)Ah, but now I reach the story . . .GAG! PUKE! WTF!!!!! *cough* *cough* Excuse me . . . Okay, I'm better now. :)Disney seriously comes up with more original and complex storylines than this (Bambi, The Lion King, etc). But lest I forget the dialogue! Whoo-boy! CLICHE is the word of the day!Anyhoo, like Batman, this film is all about the visuals (and the music) so it's best to watch it looking and listening for those things. Just cover your ears when they're not singing, folks. :) Otherwise, do yourself a favor and turn off the television, leave the movie theatre, and take your next vacation to Paris to feast your eyes on the one and only Moulin Rouge!P.S. For a better modern musical, check out Dancer in the Dark. It's definately MORE experimental and MORE creative in its experimentation than Moulin Rouge. And guess what? The dialogue's intelligent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Meant for the Big Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an absinthe drinker I felt I owed it to myself to see this movie. Fittingly this movie left me was as bad an aftertaste as the aforementioned drink. The biggest problem I had with this movie was that it was meant for the Theatre and not for the big screen. For starters the acting is way to overdone which works on stage, but comes off as contrived on the silver screen. As a film the actors look as if they're showboating their talent as to who went to the better drama school, complete with unnecessary giddiness, extremely exaggerated hand and facial gestures as well as overdoing the lines. Also the play-within-a-play would work wonderfully on a theatre stage, especially at the points when the actors come into the audience. However it just was not fun to watch actors playing characters themselves who are overacting, who then overact more because the characters themselves are actors within the movie. I also found it hard to accept the characters and the time period when every five seconds I was bombarded with recent pop music. History never asked for nor gains anything by being "remixed". History: A Remix would be a good alternate title for Moulin Rouge. Again on stage I think this could be pulled off as characters breaking into popular songs of our era would seem both spontaneous and nontraditional, a break for the boring humdrum majority of staged theatre that exists. However from the get go of the movie it set the wheels of doubt in my head in motion. My final thoughts on why this should be staged and not filmed. Lack of locations. In the entire movie there are only 3 locations: The Moulin Rouge, The Bohemians' apartment, and the Duke's Tower. It would be a snap for a stage crew to set these up (much like they did in the film), however I'm watching a Hollywood production I expect glitz, glamour, dazzle. Even Nicole Kidman appearing on screen in lingerie for 3/4 of this movie wasn't enough to save this film. 1/9 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Renting this crap was a huge mistake. What was I thinking. I totally hated "Romeo &amp; Juliet", and this looked even worse in the trailers. Plus the ever so annoying "Lady Marmelade". Uuuugggggghhhh. Well I rented it because I was curious. My parents saw it in the cinema and they said they'd had walked out after 10 minutes if they hadn't been sitting in the middle of the row. And then there was this friend of mine that said "Moulin Rouge" was the greatest movie ever made. HA I admit my parents are no Siskel &amp; Ebert (not that they were any better), for example they hated "The Godfather" and thought "The Lord Of The Rings" was boring and unrealistic. Yeah! Anyway, I was faced with a dilemma. Believe my parents or a guy that once engraved a cross on his hand with a pencil. Not that other's opinions count, not by far, but I just had to see this movie, curiosity u see.The only solution was to rent the movie.Who said that curiosity was a good thing. After seeing this movie I can say that IGNORANCE IS BLISS!!!! It starts of funny with that man conducting to the 20th century fox opening theme. But as soon as the movie picks up the pace and blasts you into a Luhrmann vison of the France during 1900 you get the general idea. Fast and awkward editing spoils, no, destroys a nice concept to revive a little piece of music and bring it to the big screen in style.This movie could have easily been stupendous and could singlehandedly bring back the zhanra of musicals. Instead I was left with the feeling that it was made very poorly, most of the sets were awful, and there was that dreadful windmill that got more screen time that most of the actors. Besides the first five minutes there's nothing to like about this movie except the somewhat good performance by Nicole Kidman. She definitely has her moments and was the only reason why I didn't push the "STOP" button on the remote control. Still, what demon possessed her to star in this one. Ewan McGregor, showing off his pearly yellowies, was watchable but in my opinion miscast. The others aren't worth talking about.It's not easy to make a musical that has a terrible sound track. Baz Luhrmann, I salute you. To shamelessly make use of many great songs and not make a single one sound even half as good as the original, now that takes true talent.A love story that is predictable and makes very little sense since Satine falls in love with Christian after he sings her a song. Is that all it takes, a song. C'mon, here we have a curtisan who daily plays with men for money and as soon as one of them breaks a base she's swept off her feet. The movie gets so boring in the 2nd half I started feeling a little masochistic, but I had to see the ending. All I can say is that nominating this movie for anything besides the "Razzies" is ludicrous and insulting to movies. Because this is nothing short of a really bad play, and that's where it should belong, on a rotting stage in bloody England. Don't get me wrong, it's not really that bad, it's just that the director is soooo much worse. I have to commend Mr. Luhrmann, for he has again surprised and amazed me with his lack of style, taste and colors.Congratulations.Without doubt the worst musical ever made. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A) Maybe this movie's innovations and themes were wasted on me (highly doubtful), or B) maybe this movie just sucked.If you selected "B," then you are correct! This movie was terrible, hands down. I usually enjoy musicals, but instead of 'reawakening' America's interest in musicals, I know this movie made me do a complete 180. In my life, I have always watched a movie in one sitting, but I could only take Moulin Rouge in small doses of about twenty minutes, or I think my head might of exploded. I'm sorry, but I have respect for songs like "All you Need is Love" and "Smells like Teen Spirit," (and if you don't, then you need to get with it),I mean, their great songs. But this movie's remakes of them, were incredibly dissapointing, and bordering with blasphemy.My ratings (out of 10): Characters, 1. Acting, 4(I think Kidmen should have one for best actress, she plays a convincing prostitute...). Plot, 4(there was one, so that gives it some credit). Music, -6. Satisfaction, 0. Enjoyment, 0. Money wasted on it, $6. Overall: 0, no joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning, otherwise vacant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really have mixed feelings about this one. It truly is a film like no other I have ever seen. The cinematography is absolutely incredible, no doubt about it; whatever artistic Oscars the film procured were well-deserved. The world that the film creates is stunning and the amazingly free movement of the camera solidifies spatial relations and brings the different locations together into a coherent whole. It really is fantastic work. That said, I didn't like--borderline hated--the film. The vast majority of "dialogue" is actually song lyrics (often rehashed) from familiar songs of the past 30 or so years. In this, it can be said that the film is often "catchy" and certainly caused the occasional smile, but really has nothing worthwhile to say. The plot would make Walt Disney jealous of its simplicity and really has nothing to add to the traditional "boy and girl want to be together but something's blocking the way". Perhaps it could be seen to be making a societal comment in its over-intentional hodge-podge of pre-existent ideas. At any rate, I guess I shouldn't be surprised that this formula still brings about success... But it was really irritating hearing the same trite, already-familiar lyrics repeated again and again. It was a musical melodrama pumped with so much false energy that I felt embarrassed for the actors at times and just wished it would stop. The acting of the two main characters was certainly average at best. The fact that Nicole Kidman was lauded for this performance truly makes me ill. But the incidental characters in the film were mostly much more solid and interesting, especially the "manager" of Moulin Rouge. I must wrap up: visually it's absolutely stunning and certainly worth watching, but it is emotionally vacant and meaningless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film "moulin rouge" is without a doubt, the worst film ever. I mean, come on. I would like to back up Renee by saying that this films' setting is a suburb of Paris in 1899, yet apparently that does not matter to Baz when he made10 this film; Having a soundtrack that consists of songs from the future(nirvana,Sound of Music, etc.), Having Kidman singing over a crowd of people without any speakers or microphones. The list goes on. I did not believe for one second that Ewan McGregors's character was depressed, or for that matter upset. The plot is absurd, the dialogue has been stabbed, and Baz Luhman should be shot. I also believe that this film being nominated for best picture is a sin. And if the majority of 5000 people think differently then they have been paid to do so. I feel badly for 20th century fox to create such a disaster. Fox has brought us magnificant films, but this definately wasnt one of them. Something is wrong with society, because me and my friends could grab a camera, film a movie in my backyard, and create a better film than that piece of garbage "Red Wind Mill". I feel terrible giving up my four dollars and my gas to go and get that film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique visual style, but still not for me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was reading an article on the visual effects of Moulin Rouge in my Cinefex--a magazine for special visual effects--and saw a beautiful, yet stylized, matte painting of Paris at the turn of the century. It was absolutely breathtaking. After a long time of debating on whether or not I should really check out this movie, I finally realized that I could rent it and not waste a terrible amount of money if I didn't like it. My opinion on the movie: I can't say for sure on whether I did or didn't like it. In many ways, I found it to be unique, and you could say that I'm not a big fan of musicals, but it turns out that the majority of the songs played in the picture is very modern.Another good thing about the movie is its unique art direction and set design, along with the stylized visuals accomplished via computers and miniatures. Australian Director Baz Luhrmann has quite a visual sense of style. He is able to combine the historical elements with today's and practically create a brand new movie genre, or enhance a movie genre, I should say. I must say that he's quite successful. However, I can't say that I'm particularly a fan of this "new" movie genre.Aside from having dazzling special effects and art direction, Moulin Rouge is rather boring when it comes to telling a story. In addition to my opinion on musicals, I'm not really a fan of romance movies, either. Unfortunately, Luhrmann was able to do nothing to fix this genre. To me, if a romance movie is good, then it probably has action, which I am particularly fond of, like Titanic and Pearl Harbor. However, I am able to admire the amount of effort by the cast and crew, who were able to try something new, it's just not my type. Story: D Visuals: A-</fullReview>

They would use ordinary buckets of poop on their stage. The poop in this elaborate plaything is a vast, elaborate artifact, but it is well aimed.Just as in the old original stage happenings, we gasp, discuss and admire. What fools we all are.

Just answer me this: Did any of the stunts, tricks, set pieces, or musical numbers, make you feel anything for, or care for, ANY of the characters? My answer is: NO, it did NOT! This film is the equivalent of that stunning beauty you see at the bar. You walk up to her, start a conversation, and all that comes out of her mouth is ignorance and stupidity and conversation about her plastic surgery improvements. Now, that does not bother a lot of people. Me, it takes a whole lot more than a flashy look and HUZZAH!! facial expressions to impress me. What's left?

If I want an assault on my senses I'll go the amusment park and ride the roller coaster. I rented Moulin Rouge because I really wanted to see what all the hype was about. The first half, the faster paced half, had me almost gagging...but then it got better. I actually could tolerate the second half. Was I impressed with the music? No. (Lady Marmalade at the end made me want to puke!) Was I impressed with Nicole Kidman? No, she grated on my nerves. Was I impressed with Ewan McGregor? More so than with either of the previous aspects. I can't be accused of not likeing it because it was "different" either...Memento was different and I enjoyed it much more the Moulin Rouge. This movie is great for those who like their senses to be overwhelmed with a flurry of activity.

		<shortDescription>Not a film, an experience. But so is watching paint dry!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann has aimed high and attempted to produce a stunning cinematic experience that is larger than life. Sadly he fell short.This film has a plot so shallow that were it a puddle, ants could wade through it. Some films succeed despite this, but Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge! is so crammed with over-exuberance that you can't help feeling that he was aware of the weakness of the plot and was trying to distract viewers from it. A good script has often overcome poor plots, but almost half the script (it irritatingly seems like more) is lifted directly from the lyrics of various songs. What begins as mildly amusing with 'The Sound of Music' rapidly wears thin as you realise that there was very little originality or creativity put in to the script. Then it becomes downright annoying that Luhrmann and Pierce have claimed writing credit for outright plagiarism of the works of many artists. Proponents of the film have pointed out to me that this isn't the point, that the whole extravanganza outweighs these shortcomings. Certainly the many song and dance routines, complete with their eclectic and impressive staging and costumes, lift the film up, but much of the great choreography is ruined by some unfortunately heavy and jarring editing that consistantly detracts from some good performances. The cast does perform well (if you like the singing performances of the actors), but the roles do not settle down well, with the tone bouncing from romantic through to farce via many other genres. This does not seem to be the fault of the cast, rather from a directorial approach that failed to decide what it wanted. The end result of this to-ing and fro-ing is that I felt no emotional contact with the characters even by the latter stages of the film and was actually thankful when Satine died as it meant that we must be near the end!That said, this film does have its good points. The visuals are stunning; the costumes and sets are divine (if you like over the top); there are many 'small touches' that are worth looking out for; and the soundtrack is an inspired collection of predominantly old pop and rock classics, but with a number of newer or new tracks as well - all are good. The concept is bold, even if the execution has produced a 'cinematic experience' that is ultimately tedious and gives the impression that the film's good points are purposely outlandish to stun you in to missing its shortcomings.Is it worth seeing? Yes - I am glad that I saw it (even more glad when the final credits came up!). Is it worth buying? Only of you are undemanding of anything more than bright colours and good music in your taste of film or else it will wear thin very rapidly. Expect to see many copies of the DVD appear on the second hand market in due course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't feel any emotions besides annoyance and discomfort during the two times-I gave it a second chance-that I saw "Moulin Rouge". I didn't feel the love and passion other people said they felt. I think the reason I didn't feel anything was because, to me, this movie is not even about the love which the characters preach so much about. First of all, the movie is more about jealousy than love. Jealousy represented in the silly and incredibly stupid Duke, idealistic Christian, and the prostitute that exposes the two lovers. Secondly, the word "love" is constantly used in vain in this movie. It is used to impress. Characters cherish inflated ideas of its importance. The John Leguizamo character keeps on using it to boast how he and other bohemians are so much better than others because they believe in "love." I agree with the other viewer who commented on "the blissfully ignorant use of...the word love" and mentioned the line from "The Princess Bride" ("I do not think you know what that word means"). It seemed as if the movie makers made the characters say the word "love" over and over again, so that if they repeated it enough the movie would be about love.False love at the sake of art does not champion love at all. "Moulin Rouge" is no true "champion" for the love which is supposed to be its theme.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After only 20 minutes of screening, I stopped the video and looked at my wife. She had the same puzzled what-the-hell-is-that look on her face. I asked her if she wanted to keep on viewing it and she told me to let it run for another 5-10 minutes to see if it got any better. It never did. That's one rental that didn't take long to rewind and get back to the store.Try to imagine a two hour long musical clip, with a pace set on hyperspeed, frantic camera work that seems to be out of control, a musical score that has not the slightest relation with the era concerned, excess of scenography and special effects to compensate for the lack of likeness and you get a phony broadway musical like Moulin Rouge.The main problem with this movie is that it was intended for an MTV audience who obviously doesn't really care what the french cancan and the Paris of the 1800s were really like, as long as there's a karaoke of number one hits sung by big hollywood names to make it "fun and exciting to watch". The directors knew that well and that's why it became so popular.When this movie came out, critics said that viewers would either love it or hate it. Simply put, it is one of the most irritating and disappointing things we've seen in years. Rating: 2/10 and that goes for the soundtrack as well. I still like the originals, though.</fullReview>

You have to let your jaw drop in giddy disbelief as Ewan and Nicole, atop an elephant, duel to love or not to love in the language of late 20th century pop music verse. Yes, the story is simple, the music deliberately plastic, and the entire production outrageous. But there are dozens of moments in this movie that will have you falling in love with the film in spite of yourself.

		<shortDescription>"The show must go on, Satine. We're creatures of the underworld. We can't afford to love." (Zidler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May 2011 update: Watched it last night. Still entertaining after all these years!SPOILERS, but further down in this review. "Moulin Rouge" caught me totally off guard. It is not a re-make of anything. It does not purport to tell any historically-accurate story. It is set in 1899 and 1900 Paris, at the Moulin Rouge "entertainment" complex, owner and show-master Zidler (Jim Broadbent) was a real person. Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo) was primarily a painter that visited brothels, and died in 1901. However, the main characters Satine (Nicole Kidman, 34) the courtesan and entertainer, Christian (Ewan McGregor, 30) the young writer, and the jealous Duke are all fictional.What caught me off-guard is the style. It is a dream-scape fairytale, it is whimsical, it is a comedy with some tragedy thrown in at the climax. It is two hours of exotic music videos with dialog thrown in to bridge the musical numbers. It is what a Salvadore Dali musical would look like, if he had been a director instead of artist. Everything is shot on a large inside set in Australia, and combined with models and CG effects, blended seamlessly to create an auditory and visual display rarely seen on film. In fact, the whole film reminds me more of an elaborate stage production with lots of set changes. I really enjoyed it, I watched it twice, on successive days. I rate it "9" of 10.Director and writer Luhrmann uses a simple and easy to follow story. Christian is idealistic, moves to Paris to write about truth, beauty, freedom, and especially LOVE. Even though he's never been in love. Lautrec and his cronies, "bohemians", are struck with Christian's ability to write beautiful poetry, actually words from 20th century love songs from the likes of Beatles, Estevan, Parton, Elton John. They want him to write the new musical "Spectacular Spectacular", he falls in love with Satine, the Duke agrees to finance renovations to the Moulin Rouge, but Zidler must promise him Satine or forfeit the deed to the place. Much of the middle of the film deals with Satine and Christian's trying to carry on a love affair while keeping it from the jealous Duke.Some viewers, not understanding the concept, objected to the use of modern lyrics in an 1899 Parisian setting. As Luhrmann explains, for the story to work, the "poetry" that Christian writes must be by consensus some of the most beautiful of all time. The only way to do that is to use lyrics of songs that have, by popular acclaim, become the best. "All You Need Is Love." "Silly Love Song." And all the others. Since the whole film is a comedic dream-scape fantasy, it works!The film starts at the end, with Christian in 1900 writing his story of the past year. He tells us in the first scene that the woman he fell in love with is dead. So we don't have that suspense during the film, we know how it will end. The whole fun is letting our senses be taken in, and just enjoy watching the story unfold. Satine dies on stage, at the end of the opening performance of "Spectacular Spectacular." And, in the last scene, Christian is completing his story, on his typewriter, about the need for love in our lives.Neither Kidman nor McGregor had ever sung professionally before, in any capacity. For actors they did quite well, although it is very clear that they are not singers. In particular, McGregor's shouted out high notes, done without any vibrato, became pretty irritating after a while. Yet, with a little more training, he could be good enough to play Elton John, if someone wanted to film his life story. But the best singer overall was Jim Broadbent, with a very fine, resonant and lyrical voice. That was a pleasant surprise.Anyone watching "Moulin Rouge" at home on videotape is missing about 75% of the fun. The DVD has great picture and sound, with either Dolby or DTS digital surround tracks selectable. The extra on the first disk puts a green "fairy" at several points and if you press "enter" on the player's remote, takes you to a couple of minutes of behind-the-scenes explanations, which I found very enjoyable on second viewing. The second disk has a lot more extras, showing about everything one wants to know about the making of this film. I like to study, not just watch, a good film, and this DVD has some of the best extras I've seen so far.And finally, it is refreshing to see a fine film with no nudity, no curse words, and no killing. My hat off to Luhrmann, I wish more directors and writers would realize how clean good movies can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the worst movie of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Moulin Rouge!" tries to narrate its meager story via a sequence of (mock versions of) various well known pop songs. This technique is appearantly borrowed from the commercials. Whether it might work in a feature film is questionable, but worth a try. "Moulin Rouge!" is such a try and a complete failure. Its lack of style, content, and originality and the awful video clip style cutting which ruins the occasionally nice decors make it hardly watchable. In my opinion, two hours of watching MTV would have been a more rewarding experience. They would have offered better music and more change. The fact that this movie received so much attention is just another evidence of the continuing decline of major studio's film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge has no unique or original story.From the start of time people talk of great loves that simply can't have a happy ending.What Moulin Rouge is all about, is a pandemonium a colours and scenes,a really divine soundtrack and an excellent cast.Furthermore it isn't just a boring,usual,sloppy film with a dull sky and some poor people crying all the time about their fate.Everything is happening so fast and you enjoy the crazy rythms of the ballet or the many funny qoutes and comical scenes.I think that it's the first true musical that is made after a long long time.And if your are in love you just can't stay untouched by this movie.</fullReview>

I thought I might have been one of those people, but alas, I found myself sinking in my seat in vicarious embarrassment for all who appeared on screen. The movie looks like it might try to have a story, but quickly decides this is too hard. Much easier is to throw up a bunch of spectacle and colors and some good-looking actors (who unfortunately open their mouths eventually). Had I paid more than US$1.50 for my seat, I would have been fuming mad. As it was, I was only a little bit mad for the waste of time and the damage to my faith in humanity.

The are stunning in every scene, and every song. Their stellar performances, especially that of Nicole Kidman, forced me to adopt this film as my favorite movie...ever. I have seen many, many movies, and very few have captured me the way Moulin Rouge did. Every aspect of the film, from acting, to singing, to costumes, to makeup, was done to near perfection. It brought music back to the big screen, and portrayed a love story of epic proportions. If you haven't seen this movie yet, stop wasting your time. I'm sorry I waited as long as I did. Awesome, Excellant, Stellar, Stunning, inspiring....well words simply can't express it. A 120 out of 10!-The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.

		<fullReview>Go sister go! Go brother go! And see the greatest show on film this year- `Moulin Rouge.' This has to be one of the most beautifully photographed films of all time. I am sure that this musical gem of a film will dance away with Best Art Direction &amp; Cinematography Academy Awards. Nicole Kidman stars as the prostitiute-showgirl of Moulin Rouge. Ewan Mcgregor co-stars as the gullible writer in search of love &amp; freedom at the Moulin Rouge. The film is about their love, song, and dance at the Moulin Rouge. The high notes of the film (and there are many) are the illuminating, colorful, and energetic musical sequences. The low notes, if any, are the way too many appearances of the ruthless duke who derails from the beauty of the film. Kidman should `cruise' (sorry nic) her way to a Best Actress Oscar nomination. Mcgregor was far out with his performance. Co-stars John Leguizamo &amp; Jim Broadbent eccentric acting should be recognized at oscar time. Kudos should also go to Director Baz Luhrmann's creative direction. So set sail to the cinematic experience of the year at the `Moulin Rouge.' ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge was a fantastic film that brilliantly used music from artists like Nirvana, U2, Elton John and The Police. The songs were incredible, the set(typical of Luhrmann's shows) was an over-the-top spectacular show and the acting was first-class. Nicole Kidman gave probably the weakest performace of the cast and she was excellent. Ewan McGregor gave arguably the best performance of his short career, and the entire cast brought in a remarkably powerful performance. If you like romance, drama, absurdist comedy or popular music, this is the film for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the beginning of this film has turned off many viewers with its frenetic dance number with glitter and can-can dancers, if you will sit through the first ten minutes you will truly be in for a fabulous entertainment experience. The way Luhrman has woven together a heart-wrenching love story with contemporary music and incredible design elements carries you away into a fantastical world. It is set in 1899, but because Luhrman isn't obsessed with making it the traditional "period" it enables the audience to identify and suspend their disbelief. The well-trained, but not overly-crafted voices of Kidman and McGregor are refreshing. The songs serve as an extension of their emotion, not a showcase of talent. AS the story soars forward you find yourself laughing and crying, hoping and wondering at the characters and what they choose. It is a beautiful story, give it a chance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most amazing movie of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see very few movies in the movie theater. Most of them are not worth the $10 it costs, when I can rent it in a few months for $1.99. This movie I have seen twice, and I'm already looking for another day next week to go see it again! It gave me chills. I listen to the soundtrack over and over again. I call it "Moulin Rouge Radio - all Moulin Rouge, all the time." If this doesn't get nominated for at least several Academy Awards, it will be a travesty. Note: This movie is not for everybody. You have to like: a)Musicals, b)Ewan McGregor c)filmmaking, or any combination of the above. I don't think liking Nicole Kidman is enough, because that usually means guys, and they don't generally like musicals, but if you are on the verge of going...go! There are some very funny sections ("Like a Virgin" is hilarious!) I do think a lot of people are mislead by the commercials and ads they are seeing, because I have heard of a lot of people walking out after the first 15 minutes. Again, it's not for everybody. But it is for me and that's all I can say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with mixed emotions. I saw the trailer for the first time a while ago and knew I HAD to see it as soon as it came out. As time went on, I discovered that it was actually a musical and that they would be using modern-type songs. At that point, I was severely concerned for the well-being of the filmmakers, but I still hadn't seen the movie, so I couldn't exactly pass judgement. About a week ago, I finally broke down and saw it. I went into it knowing I was going to be completely weirded out, but I didn't know I was going to laugh as much as I did. What a wonderful movie. It's such a great mix of humor, romance, action, music, and COLOR! OH, the COLORS! I don't think there is anything about this movie that I was disappointed with. Mind you, Moulin Rouge is not a movie for everyone. After checking out the reviews here, it's plain to see that people either loved it or hated it, in general. I am one of those who LOVED it. It's a movie that will stay with me for a long time. If you still have yet to see it, however, SEE IT IN THE THEATERS, if at all possible. This kind of brilliance deserves to be viewed on the big screen, I fear a small screen will not be able to do it justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies are so unique that they seem to be the creation of a single mind, a single artistic vision, even if this isn't actually the case. Such films would include Citizen Kane, Rear Window, The Draughtsman's Contract, the recent Oh Brother Where Art Thou? and, now, Moulin Rouge. Did I love it? Yes, in spite of the frequent use of quick-cut editing (cut to new viewpoint every .5 seconds). Will most people love it? I can't say, but I doubt it.However, with a movie like this, no one could have told me if I would like it, for no one knows me quite that well. And if I hadn't seen it for myself now, in a theater, I would have seen it for the first time on a TV set, and (after my dazzled mind settled down a bit) kicked myself.If it helps, the trailer gives an accurate idea of the main plot and artistic style, but doesn't hint at the farcical humor, mostly in the movie's first third. However, it only gave a hint of the total impact the movie would have on me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of musicals. Or of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, and half of the cast I had never even heard of. But this movie was awesome! I mean it's probably the best movie I've seen in my lifetime. The movie starts out kinda campy and annoying, but the Green Fairy and the Abstinse stuff was just hilarious! And when they finally get down to it, the Moulin Rouge nightclub is probably the most beautiful spectacle of lights, music, color, and excitement I've ever seen. The camera was like a rollercoaster, twisting and turning almost to the point of giving me a headache. And the music, it was amazing. One of the coolest things about this movie is how you can mix Madonna and Nirana and come out with something that totally fits with the movie. But deep down this movie has a very emotional core. At the end of the movie, everyone, and I do mean everyone, in the theater was either bawling hysterically or trying to cover up the fact that tears were running down their face. Go watch the movie, it's one of the greatest you'll ever see, you might be surprised when you realize a week later your watching it for the third time wanting to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that is as packed with wild visual imagery as this one is usually accused of being devoid of meaning. In this case, the images assist the meaning.There is a feeling of being young in a new world, full of thousands of new sensory experience. When the hero realises that he is indeed in love, the film slows down, his new universe reduced to the two hearts beating in unison. As in many love stories, hearts are broken, and we are drawn in, closer and closer. This film is about people, their faces filling the screen. The camera lingers on the countenance of each of the players. Eyes predominate, letting us glimpse into the souls of these people.Hypnotic, mesmerizing and seductive, this work is worthy of, if not requiring, multiple viewings. </fullReview>

And I wish Users would stop referring to this film as "a Hollywood musical". It was made in Australia by an Australian Director, with almost exclusively English and Australian stars!

		<shortDescription>The inside scoop on Moulin Rouge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It isn't often that I get to let people in on Hollywood backlot gossip but here goes....Did YOU know that Max Bialystock of "The Producers" fame had an alternative production in mind for his "sure to be a flop" Springtime for Hitler? Why yes....It was Moulin Rouge. Judging by the many rave reviews of this poorly edited, WAY over the top production, it would have worked just as well too.Since my diatribe will be painful to many of Moulin's fans I'll be brief. Moulin proves that if you take a weak plot,cartoonishly developed characters,couple it with poor writing and even worse editing it can still be a hit as long as you make it colorful and sparkely. The last time I saw a movie this disappointing Nicole Kidman was there too.(Eyes Wide Shut) PLEASE stop comparing this heap to "Rocky Horror Picture Show". At least "Rocky" had it's own original musical score and didn't shamelessly rely on songs that were already proven to be hits. I predict Moulin Rouge will be a big hit for those that have a short attention span and are attracted to bright and shiny objects. The theaters will, no doubt, be full of starlings for the next few days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You should see this movie for the beauty of Nicole Kidman, if for no other reason. I think her supernatural beauty reached its unprecedented peak in this movie. Her first appearance, a close-up of her face, is the most breathtaking show of female beauty since the violent eye of Elizabeth Taylor shocked us in the beginning of "The Taming of the Shrew".You should see this movie for Jim Broadbent, if for no other reason. It is embarrassing to have to admit it, but I had no idea what this amazing actor could do until I saw this. I had seen him in "Bridget Jones", where he is spectacularly underused. I had seen him in "Iris", where he is heartbreakingly brilliant. Later, I would see him in the Harry Potter series, where, like all the other actors of note, he got paid for doing tragically little. He, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, and on and on, lent their names, got well paid, and did little more than propping up younger actors. Broadbent sings, he mugs, he dances, he is hilarious, he is farcical, he is cynical, he is tragic. He is a one-man acting army in this.You should see this movie for Ewan McGregor, if for no other reason. He's almost as pretty as Nicole. But who knew he could sing? And sing he does, wonderfully. And he will make you cry.You should see this movie for the music, if for no other reason. Baz Lurhmann's cheerful anachronisms are hilarious and wonderful, starting with "The Sound of Music", going through a stellar medley of '60's hits, highlighted with Elton John's "Your Song", and reaching a farcical peak with a dance number to "Like a Virgin" which will leave you in pain with laughter. Listen for a grand operatic rendition of Sting's "Roxanne", which will knock your socks off! You should see this movie for Baz Luhrman, a writer and director who can pull off this improbable, impossible movie, make you swallow it, and make you love it.You should see this movie!</fullReview>

Satine and Christian's story is the most powerful cinematic love story to ever grace our screens. I was captivated by the darkness of it all yet inspired by the joy and romance. I think so many films are cliché and rather cheesy but this definitely isn't. Visually the movie is stunning and the songs are brilliant; a unique twist on the everyday musical. The script also doesn't disappoint. Nichole and Ewan do a a fantastic job of portraying the characters, nobody could get across the love that they feel for one another and the pain they have to go through to be together.

		<fullReview>I believe Baz Luhrmann's masterpiece is what re-ignited interest in the movie musical. Everything about this movie keeps you captivated. The characters do an impressive job. Ewan McGregor is convincing as the starry-eyed idealistic poet who falls in love with Satine. He sees nothing but her, and his face lights up when she walks into the room. Nicole Kidman does a decent job in her role as well, although all she has to do is be gorgeous and tantalizing. Towards the end of the movie, she does pick up her game and presents a haunting portrait of a woman who knows she has doomed herself to a life of torment without her love. Both of them do fine as singers. I am sure their voices were touched up a lot, but who cares? The supporting cast is great as well. The Duke sneers effectively. Jim Broadbent as Harold Zigler is great as the manager of the Moulin Rouge. He is a kind man, although his first love is his theater. He truly is sorry he has to ask Satine to sacrifice herself, but not sorry enough that he is willing to see the Moulin Rouge go bankrupt. He has a great number towards the end called The Show Must Go On. My favorite supporting actor by far has to be John Leguizamo, a Baz Luhrmann regular. He plays the dwarfed version of Toulouse-Lautrec well and represents all that glitters in the Bohemian. He believes in truth, beauty, and love and wants everyone around him to have all 3 if possible.The music is breathtaking. I always cry during the Come What May at the end of the show. And the look of the film is just beautiful. It makes the Moulin Rouge look like a beautiful carnival of sound, color, and melody.The pacing is just right. I understand that Luhrmann has a background in opera. This truly shows in his ability to make powerful use of the music mixed with the pictures. He has knowledge of how to play his audience. I was also impressed with how he created just the right mix of tragedy and comedy. During Act II, a very dark act, he throws in a light number, Like a Virgin, which provides needed comic relief. There is also the stunning dance number Roxanne, which makes effective use of the montage technique using scenes from both the dancers and the turmoil happening upstairs in an erotic tango. He truly builds tension to the breaking point.I highly recommend this movie for a romantic evening, a girls' night, or as a pick me up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is possibly the best movie I have seen. It includes great acting, musical genius, and insanely good camera work. The bittersweet love story will touch the soul, while the comic relief will make you laugh until you cry. Nicole Kidman (Satine) and Ewan McGregor (Christian), flourish in their acting roles. You can feel their pain and happiness accentuated by their talent-filled singing voices. You cannot forget the supporting cast for they are equally as excellent. Jim Broadbent (Harold Zidlar) and John Leguizamo (Toulouse-Lautrec) shine in their comic filled roles. The vivid camera work makes you feel like you're at the Moulin Rouge in 20th century France. The music combines well known songs like "Like a Virgin" by Madonna and "Your Song" by Elton John. All and all this movie delivers in a comedic-musical-love story that is what every person craves in a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Put a couple of "beautiful people" together in a romantic fantasy musical rather like in a modernised version of anything by Rogers and Hammerstein, lots of songs all strung along any-old-how, with a story-line which doesn't matter, and box-office success is assured and everyone is HAPPY! Great show-biz, but dismal film-making; about as original as a cold pizza on a park bench in the bleak mid winter, and throwing in a handful of snow - whether artificial or not - makes no difference. Supposedly Paris in the early 1900s but laden with songs from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, with anything - but ANYTHING - from Dolly Parton to Sting, passing through Buffy Sainte-Marie and Elton John and a bit of Lennon/McCartney - and throwing in for good measure the only pieces to have existed then from Offenbach (which must have had Les Folies Berg?res splitting their sides and gurgling with mirth backstage), this film lurches along in a frivolous capriccio accompanied by lurid overblown photography.Spectacular show, but pretty lousy film-making. The only good thing going for it was that it did not have Richard Gere (who probably can't sing) and Jennifer López (who can), or, even worse pairing up somebody like the unbearable Keanu Reeves with Shannon Elisabeth.I give "Moulin Rouge" just under three out of ten as some of the songs were "nice" and at times were cleverly strung together. Which is why I cannot understand why the US vote is lower than the rest of the world..........

		<fullReview>Okay - "moulin rouge" is the film who i liked most in last five years. First there is the great pop music - who have made this film to an great event. Bowies "Heros" become never a better place before - as a love song on an elephant. Secund there was a white girl from Australia -who made it tragic and comedy from one the other moment. She is so beautiful and funny that no man can ever forget here - and thats is the story of the film. A legendary story about a phantasy's in Paris - in a place who has never been there so as in the film is shown. A psychological dimension - about the greatest think in the world: LOVE. and that in a good and funny way... I love this film because he is more than all the others a film about a feeling and he has catch it. And is a film with the greatest actress in our time who became better and better...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate musicals. Well, not all of them but almost. That's also why i put off watching this one for years. Simply because i didn't think i could possibly enjoy it. And did i? Well. Let's see.Baz Luhrmann has made the more or less "hysterical" film-making his thing. And this is certainly quite hysterical. The pace is admirably high throughout, but also skillfully kept at a level where we still have energy to keep watching. Luhrmanns feeling for visuals and audio is impeccable. Making this an experience that assaults the senses in a very dramatic way. I must admit though that even though the movie seemed to do everything available to keep the viewers interest up, the frantic pace got the best of me in the end. The last 15-20 minutes were rather painfully prolonged.So what about the music? This is a musical after all. Well, the songs were quite sing-a-long friendly. I felt like breaking out singing myself several times. Especially when hearing the sometimes quite painfully weak voice of Ewan McGregor. Maybe it was not THAT bad, but i was not impressed. Otherwise the singing as well as the picking of music was top-notch. A lot of classic songs that might not fit that well into the 1900's Paris, but perfectly into the burlesque mood of the film, mixed nicely with brand new material.So, what's the verdict. Well i must say this movie was not really for me. While i enjoyed it more than your typical musical it was still just too frantic and bizarre for my tastes. The acting was OK and the music was great, but still it's too much for me. I guess many people love this, but i give it an average rating. Knowing that my taste is the real problem here. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning beauty but thin in substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Beautiful" is a word to describe Moulin Rouge. It is terrific sounding, decadent, full of splendor, and ... well ... obnoxious.It is a polarizing film, either fresh and exciting or clichéd and overblown. So I find myself at odds because I am rating this film a 5 on the IMDb scale. That's right, directly in the middle. It is a simple matter of mathematics. The story is probably a 3 or 4 but the music and staging is so breathtaking, it lifts the film up to at least mediocrity.The plot is simply told. Above all else it is a love story told from the point of view of a Bohemian writer who is in love with a Moulin Rouge dancer/singer/whatever. There you have the flaw. With a love story such as this you have to feel the connection between the characters, above all you have to feel love.Moulin Rouge's characters seem like actors playing their parts, with the possible exception of Ewan McGregor who seemed more and more genuine as the film progressed. Nicole Kidman received praise for her portrayal of the tormented prostitute who must choose between love or sensibility. I found her performance elegant looking and sounding but without much depth or feeling.The production is as much a character as the actors. The musical numbers run from stunning beauty (as when McGregor and Kidman perform "Come What May") to the inane (Jim Broadbent prancing around singing Madonna's "Like a Virgin"). The entire movie was filmed on a soundstage in Australia and it has a sort of claustrophobic feel. But it also reminds me of images from a time well before my own when musicals were shot entirely on giant soundstages bursting with color and exploding with sound.Director Baz Luhrmann succeeds in making a film unlike any other. Perhaps that is a nod to the Bohemian brotherhood in the film's story. But if that were true, why not spend more time baking the story rather than marching on to the next schizophrenic eye-candy piece? The obsessive jump-cuts, maniacal characters, color washed sets, and extravagant costumes all yell out "we're overblown and we know it!" But isn't self-congratulatory vanity still just vanity? I wonder what the style of the film is attempting to say about the Bohemians, are they lashing out against average society's morals and taboos or are they just being different? **.5 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I am no fan of musicals, but this was garbage. Why take two fine actors and have them sing? Would anybody have watched this if Kidman and McGregor weren't in it? The story was probably barfed up on a Sunday afternoon. Was there one original thought or score in the whole thing? Why take a nice little song by Elton John and have it proclaimed dully by Ewan McGregor and Richard Roxburgh? I choked on my drink when the guy kept shouting 'Roxanne!' like he had lost his dog. Too many questions (but too small to care). Hey Lady! you're coughing up blood; I'd ask the doctor about that. Hey Christian! can't you wait until the show is over? People have paid good money to see it. Hey Zidler! The little ho is dying; not too smart to put on a show with her leading, now is it? As long as we're borrowing: why not take out your light saber to prevent her from going to the dark side? This one is on my blacklist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it fair to write a review of a movie that you could not bring yourself to finish? I missed this one at the movies and on rental (and thank goodness I didn't waste my money...) so took a look at it when it was shown on T.V. last night. The first ten minutes had me saying... "What the ****??" and the rest of the first 45 minutes had me squirming. Sorry, that was all I could take of Nicole Kidman's obnoxious wide-eyed Kewpie-Doll acting (shallower than a 10 cent goldfish bowl) and I won't even mention her singing. I cannot even imagine what "style" the directors were going for unless it was an overblown-overlong music video: no cliché was too obvious to be unexploited, no old movie was left unparodied and no pop song was left unplundered. The only positive note was the lush colours and visuals and even that cloyed after a while. I imagine it was very popular with 13 year-old girls the way "Cabaret" was in my day (only "Cabaret" was a much better film.) I won't rate it because I couldn't finish watching it. That alone should tell you something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Musical Since "The Sound of Music".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outstanding musical that is breath-taking, smart, visually-stunning and top-notch in most all cinematic categories. It is 1899 Paris, France and a young poet (Ewan McGregor) falls in love with the main attraction at the Moulin Rouge club (courtesan Nicole Kidman in her Oscar-nominated performance). But trouble looms as the Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh in perhaps a star-making role) has his eyes on the club and Kidman herself. Kidman is put into a dilemma as all she has worked and slaved for could be taken away in a heartbeat by Roxburgh. The fact that her heart belongs to McGregor adds to the problem. Jim Broadbent (Oscar-winning for "Iris" even though he is much better in this film) steals every scene as the master of ceremonies at the club. John Leguizamo also does the best work of his career as McGregor's vertically-challenged best friend. "Moulin Rouge" is a smart film that is a mix of "Cabaret" and "Titanic". It is both highly dramatic and visually stunning in every way imaginable. This is hands down the best musical produced in over 35 years and its great success critically and economically could be enough to resurrect the Hollywood musical, an art that has been in limbo since the late-1960s. Baz Luhrmann's direction makes him the greatest star of "Moulin Rouge". 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, that is not enough to make you overlook the ridiculus plot or the contrived script. From the moment Ewan McGregor first began to sing (in a send up of the Sound of Music), I knew we were in for something truly cringe-worthy. This scene was only topped by the version of Like a Virgin (Yes, Madonna's Like a Virgin) sung by the fat nightclub owner and the effeminate English duke. Even a wonderful performance by the ever reliable Ewan McGregor couldn't save this film. My advice: Save your time/money and a few brain cells.</fullReview>

Let's use songs we already know people loved, big top 40 tunes only of course, and then let's set as a backdrop a dieing prostitute falling madly in love with an impoverished writer, using about 40000 cuts per hour filled with wild whacky sound effects as we zoom in on somebody's face and call it a blockbuster. My good friend and fellow critic calls this "Better than Casa Blanca". I weep for his future children. Although the actors did well with their material, the shallowness of this drizzle prevented me from really caring who got the prostitute. A ridiculous but shameful hyper-indulgence, much like the Moulin Rouge itself, I presume.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can say just two good things about this movie: Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor sing better than you might expect; and a few moments are visually rapturous. Otherwise, the movie is ludicrous from start to finish, with a plot that's little more than an outline, sharp changes in tone, MTV-video style production numbers, and -- worst of all -- songs that end in mid-song, without conclusion. In fact, the movie rather resembles a long, bad MTV video. See it at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am vaguely aware of the reasons that led me to see this film other than that I did not pay to see it. As the opening credits rolled I actually had a good feeling about what might happen, but what ensued I can barely describe. When the movie starts out with a young writer saying "All one needs is to love, and be loved in return," you know you're in trouble. The Parisian sets looked fake, nothing like what Gladiator achieved by bringing ancient Rome to life. In fact, this whole movie seemed fake, contrite, and just not very well thought out. I generally like Nichole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, but not when they sing 70's hit parade music to a dizzying and sloppy film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A series of skits incoherently jumbled together.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am one of those people who is often sucked in by the hype surrounding a film and as such when it fails to live up to the publicity I can sometimes become very disappointed.Moulin Rouge, at least in Australia, was hyped to the hilt. Posters with declarations like "This is a story about Love", "This is a story about Truth" were around for months. The movie advertisements promised plenty with high octane editing, magnificent costumes and an overwhelming visual and aural energy. The publicity promised a story as sensual and passionate as the images and sounds the film contains. As such I went in with high expectations of something that would grab me by the throat and drag me into the seady, sexy, dirty, passionate world of the Moulin Rouge. I wanted to become involved, I wanted to see the pure, simple Christian become defiled and debased as he was seduced by Satanic Temptress Satine. I wanted unfair brutality thrown in the face of kindness, complexity into the face of simple ideals and to be burnt by dirty human characters not bored by the flaky caricateurs I see in this film.The storyline goes like this: Christian, poor writer from London comes to Montmartre Paris presumably to bathe himself in the (allegedly) bohemian atmosphere and lifestyle, the epicentre of which was located at the Moulin Rouge. At the Moulin Rouge he spots Satine, weird red headed woman and star of the Moulin Rouge show. Christian is smitten and in quick time (and thanks to an implausible "twist of fate") winds up meeting the courtesan. Within a few short minutes the two amorous beasts are "in love".But how could it ever be so simple? Christian can't have Satine without a bit of a custody battle ensuing between himself and the vaudevillian Duke of Worcester, and of course Satine coming down with a "tragic" case of tuberculosis. It all gets too irritating and too stupid. Humourless lines like "You have to hurt him to save him" are juxtaposed against (occasionally hilarious) covers like Madonna's Like a Virgin, which contrasts with the deadly serious Your Song, and the menacing Roxanne. All in all the film should probably leave most in the audience cold, but I doubt it will. More like a fireworks show set to music it can't be seen as a regular movie but more as a series of loosely connected skits, some of which work on their own, some of which don't, but taken all together they just don't fit properly. The performances apart from Nicole Kidman's are all pretty good, although there is little to no chance for real character development. Richard Roxburgh is probably the highlight with his comical exasperation one of the few emotions you can actually understand and identify with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Theatrics: Plus and Minus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moulin Rouge is nothing if not theatrical. Director Baz Luhrmann has a distinct vision that one would recognize even if his name weren't in the credits; his pursuit of all things artificial is evident. But here, unlike Strictly Ballroom and William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, his dogged pursuit of a kind of Zen-like cleverness fails. Moulin Rouge isn't a bad movie, exactly. Artifice and over-the-top hysteria have their place, and can make for a quite entertaining, sometimes thrilling, experience. But if you are aiming for the stratosphere with your artistic vision, by all means don't let it ever touch the ground. When Moulin Rouge is just being theatrically silly for its own sake, it soars; but Luhrmann is using every false device ever invented in the service of a story that was probably hoary in 1899, when this film takes place. His theatricality not only overwhelms the emaciated plot, but it doubly points out--again and again--just how hackneyed the storyline is. These are archetypes, not characters; these are plot devices, not drama. I wanted to like this movie, I really did; at times it was so much clever fun (the "Roxanne" tango number, for instance) that I was transported. But its weaknesses can't help but seep in and pretty soon Moulin Rouge is nothing but a remote, chilly experience. When Luhrmann sets all his machines in motion toward the end, one is simply repelled by his lunatic manipulations. How can one feel any emotion (and, boy, is it laid on thick like gravy) for (non)characters for whom the movie's theatrics have made empathetic involvement impossible? As my friend and I were riding in the parking garage elevator after the movie trying to sort out our feelings for the movie, two women got on having the exact same conversation. "Oh, good" I said, honestly relieved, "it wasn't just me." We all stepped out of the elevator and stood and talked for several minutes trying to sort it all out. That is certainly a sign of a director's accomplishing something, but it doesn't necessarily mean the accomplishment was good.</fullReview>

The supporting cast, especially Zidler, made me feel like I was being held hostage in a carnival gone bad.

		<fullReview>Baz Luhrmann's long awaited film Moulin Rouge has been unleashed - and what an unmemorable, over produced disappointment.The curtains opened and I waited for an innovative and spectacular movie experience. Presented instead with what might as well have been Mel Brooks meets 'The Sound of Music' (complete with table cloth 'Mother Mary style' on the fat man singing 'Like a Virgin').Jim Broadbent is excellently cast as Zidler (the owner of the Moulin Rouge). Satine (Nicole Kidman) as the head dancer/courtisan/actor gives her very best but ultimately her performance (and lip-synching) is lack lustre. Richard Roxburgh playing The Duke of Monroth is unbelievable having no authority or presence on the screen.If an unoriginal cheesy sound track with manic edits, motion sickness inducing cinematography and Mel Brooks style humor is your cup of tea, you'll love it.One star out of five.</fullReview>

It does't work as a comedy(because it's not funny)not even a lame one, and drama?.....seriously?...I can only assume that the decision to use non singing actors to try and sing the horrible songs was done for comedic relief. So far I haven't spoken to anyone who liked this movie, and when it comes up as a rerun the offending channel is turned as soon as possible. The actors that were in this train wreck are good actors (but terrible singers), so the blame for this turkey probably lies with the director/producers.....who are probably saying to everyone now,"Well, we thought it was a good idea at the time.".....oh, and to top it off, this movie won an Oscar or two?.. that goes to prove that it's not the quality of the work, it's who you know in the business...btw, I am in the business...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From classic love songs to modern dance-provoking numbers, Moulin Rouge has made itself an instant Luhrman classic. Baz's hard work truly shows itself in the sheer musical perfection of the movie. Starring classic songs such as Elton John's 'Your Song' in a dreamy night scene of Christian (Ewan McGregor) and Satine (Nicole Kidman) dancing romantically under the stars. A fantastic medley of the greatest love songs ever written, sung excitedly on the suburban rooftops and inventively named 'Elephant Love Medly'. The whole Bohemian aura of the movie is theatrically enticing, with clearly defined characters who play a large part in the inspiring setting Paris. On the edge of the love, truth and freedom crazed revolution, young writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) finds himself apart of a Bohemian play, and he's asked to write for them. He soon discovers himself reading his poetry to the club's star and beautiful courtesan Satine (Kidman), he instantly he falls in love with her and finds himself apart of a deadly love triangle with the clubs most prestigious patron- The Duke (Roxburgh) Throughout the film the camera angles vary from high panning shots of the musical to the intense face-to-face eye level romance cuts. Baz creatively uses black and white to colour scenes in conjunction with extreme wide shots to give the 'time travel' effect when zooming over the city in Paris. The editing and camera work all come together to form the classic Baz Style film that is easily recognized by any movie lover. During the scenes in the movie, it jumps from the present time to past rapidly with Christian (Ewan McGregor) typing the story as he narrates. It constantly zooms in and out of the Moulin Rouge to clearly portray the party vibe of the club. In the song 'Lady Marmalade' Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent) jumps around the Moulin Rouge dancing with his burlesque women and keeping himself head of the party. Kidman makes her first entrance into The Moulin Rouge by coming down from the ceiling on a swing covered with glitter in an extravagant silver costume, she excitedly sings the world renowned song 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend'. "The greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love, and be loved in return" this important yet memorable quote takes front seat in the movie along with Christian's (McGregor) love song chorus quotes throughout. The young writer's infatuation with love builds up over the movie, though it does meet some twists and turns and he finds out love is not always easy. A musical masterpiece portrayed perfectly on screen this one of a kind movie hit jackpot in both actors and writers, with heartfelt songs to display the emotion and eccentric dance songs to give The Moulin Rouge the true burlesque finish. The top of a movie lover's must-watch list of all time.</fullReview>

It's completely pretentious and without any sort of merit from an artistic standpoint. Nicole Kidman is a square peg in a round hole in a musical, period. She's mediocre to begin with, overvalued as an actor in general, and horribly miscast in this movie. I couldn't even watch the movie. If I hadn't fallen asleep 3 times while trying to get through this horrible film, I'd want to throttle most of the actors for over acting. I realize I'm in the minority here, but anyone who thinks this movie is unique has never seen a decent Broadway musical.This movie is Velveeta on Wonder Bread.

		<fullReview>I can't remember the last time I saw a movie this odious. I appreciate musicals; I am not opposed to vulgarity or exaggeration; I like Bowie and Madonna as much as the next guy. But after being barraged with this film's raunchy idiocy for about two hours, I was entirely desensitized to the costumes, the tolerable singing, the heroes' predicament. Not even its mockery quotient made viewing it a worthwhile experience -- I was far too irritated to enjoy a good laugh.On the bright side, watching this atrocity will likely have the effect of making the other movie we rented last night seem brilliant in comparison. That movie is Legally Blonde. In fact, this movie makes the film I had previously held to be the worst of all time look rather brilliant . . . that would be Urban Menace, in which Snoop Dogg plays "an insane urban preacher bent on revenge." Oddly enough, though, that movie earned 1.8 stars on this website, and is #50 on IMDB's list of the 100 most poorly ranked films. Moulin Rouge, on the other hand, earned a respectable 8.1 at the time of this review. Perhaps some scheming 12-year-old girl with a crush on Ewan McGregor wrote hundreds of reviews under different user names, and stuffed the ballot box? I can only hope so.In retrospect I see that the horrifying spectacle that so offended me last year -- that is, Christina Skankilera, Lil' Kim, Pink and Mya prancing around in teddies and hotpants and wrecking a reasonably good LaBelle song -- was perfectly appropriate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, I'm only 23 years old. So I'm not criticizing this movie because I wasn't raised on MTV. Nor am I a conservative 23 year old. My "recent" modern-style movies are "Requiem for a Dream" and "Fight Club." Nor am I a fan of depressing, dreary movies. I also like romantic, period pieces like `Sense and Sensibility' and `A Room With A View" (Which both of them I also consider funny and witty comedies of manners). I'm also a fan of Luhrmann's "Romeo and Juliet." I guess generally like hyper-camera work and romance to be separate from each other. I associate dark lighting and fast camera work with darker issues. I admit, I like compartmentalization."Moulin Rouge" to me was a big disappointment. To me, `Being John Malkovich' is a creative movie because it was creative visually and plot-wise. `Moulin Rouge' is creative visually-MUCH more so than BJM I add-but the plot line is rather cliché. And the character's names Christian and Satine? Can you be more cheesy? Or does Baz mean Christian and Satan? Now, that's intriguing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't just a bad movie, it's a boring and irrelevant movie with no soul, the kind where you never for a minute forget that you're sitting in a theatre. There is one honest character in this film, and he's the villain. The heroes are all self-deluded, deceitful, shallow, little people for whom it is impossible to have any sympathy watching them grub their way through their confused and uninteresting existences. I often found myself looking longingly at the 'EXIT' signs in the corner of the theatre. At the end, I kept praying for the iceberg to gut their ship- oops, wrong movie, but the same sentiment.The performances are terrible. Kidman, as Satine, invests her role as the top attraction at a notorious Parisian brothel with all the emotive range of a Barbie doll. McGregor, usually sparkling and energetic on screen, wallows listlessly as Christian, Satine's vapid boy-toy poet. Leguizamo as Lautrec is ludicrous, as are most of the supporting cast. The guy in the tablecloth is particularly odious.Kidman not only couldn't act her part, she couldn't sing it, either. Her voice, in the high registers of a timid pre-adolescent girl, scrapes the ears. McGregor definitely has a better soprano than his co-star, but as a Scottish tenor, he's no Fran Healy, and when the song calls for emotional intensity, he bellows. In one scene where Christian and Satine are engaged in a lovers' duet of sorts, they seem to be competing to drown out the other. Such lack of intimacy and tenderness between lovers is not convincing of romance. And this may be where the movie fails most badly- there is absolutely no chemistry between these two actors. It's hard to believe that Christian and Satine even know each other, let alone are passionate lovers. It's not possible to become engaged in their story because the actors are not engaged in their performances and their singing is making you wince in pain. This romance was not credible and the only regret I felt at the ending was that the Duke's man missed so many opportunities.As always with Luhrman's movies, there's a lot of colorful cinematography and noise going on, but the story is empty and the characters are mere shadows. There was only one scene I enjoyed, the Roxanne tango, because in its brief moment it told a truly dramatic story, was well-performed, filmed with uncharacteristic subtly. Everything meaningful in the movie was defined in this one scene, although it could have been improved by eliminating those annoying edits back to the tribulations of the main characters.At the climax of the movie, the aforementioned villain views the mess with a disgusted expression on his face, turns and walks out. I shared his opinion and did the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, like many others, am drawn in by beauty. And, with Romeo&amp;Juliet and Strictly Ballroom being two remarkable movies, I thought, "This one is going to be great." I purposely stayed away from reviews until I could get to the theatre. Much to my dismay, the movie held much contempt for its audience. Nicole Kidman wanted nothing more than to display her talents and executed a terribly shallow role of a character that was very complex.Toulouse-Lautrec was reduced to a caricature of a dwarf with a speech impediment, when in truth he was the embodiment of Montmarte's bohemian scene. It was he who brought artists out of the church and into the newly invented method of mass production and made their art the icons of the age! He was at the center of a movement that later spawned the Beats, the Hippies, and all other degenerates who brilliantly create the words, art, music and theatre of their generations.The fact that the producers spent so much money to give the movie such visual splendor and so little on making it an important piece of art is a perfect representation of a lot of over-budgeted movies today. Couldn't the script have been clever, not trite? Couldn't they have used actual music from the period and given it a modern beat instead of using Elton John and Nirvana? Couldn't they decide whether the movie should be a farce or a drama, instead of something confusing in between? Couldn't the cast embrace the history of their roles (Zidler was great) and then create intelligent satire? I am so disappointed in this movie. I think I'll make myself feel better about the state of film making and go see Shreck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Baz tries too hard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well for me this is a groundbreaking movie, I don't think I have ever hated a film from the opening '20 Century Fox' intro. Poor Baz gives us a fine example of how success can inflate the ego so that it becomes very hard to focus on creating a humble, sincere and thoughtful piece of work. He takes the elements of Romeo &amp; Juliet that make it such an original masterpiece - ie. unique fresh fast paced camera work, extravagant 'in your face' sets and costume design and an intense depth of emotion - and blows it so far out of proportion so that he thinks it can't possibly fail.Baz, you struck the balance perfectly in Romeo &amp; Juliet, there was no need to try and blast our socks off by making the ride louder and wilder unless it had other elements that would have made it fitting. That would make for a very intense piece of work and this wasn't intense, it was a flimsy story with no depth that simply did not merit the movie's extreme style. It's like taking a boring song and trying to make it sound amazing by playing it at a ridiculously high volume. It doesn't work and will only impress listeners that get excited from sensory impact but have no idea about substance. Well it seems to have worked as it's a box office hit and the majority of reviewers on IMDb were so overwhelmed that they couldn't tell that the movie was just that metaphoric cacophonous noise. I am a little sad that so many people think that "those who don't like it, don't get it", you've obviously been left so dizzy from the ride that it's hard to see that there was nothing going on under all the glitz and glamour to GET.The only thing I thought was original and did work at some places in the movie was the use of famous pop songs as the message that the characters were trying to convey, but I feel it was still wasted on a movie that fell apart on every other level.Please Baz put away your BAZMARK INC. label and stop trying to take movie making to even giddier heights because you are getting a little out of your depth. I know you'll probably hate me for saying that but hey, I wasted $12 on it so I'm still a little peeved ..............2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am amazed at how bad this movie was and how my wife and I could barely make it through the first 30 minutes, saying to each other, "perhaps it will get better..." It never did! To watch this and enjoy it, you have to be either very drunk, on drugs, or disturbed psychologically. Just think a very colorful, in your face 2 hour music video that makes no sense. I understand what the director was trying to do, but why he did it this way and why it earned so much praise just boggles my mind. I think the director telegraphs his desires for the audience near the beginning, that everyone get as high on absinthe as its characters do. Only then, will this ridiculous movie be appreciated. Spectacular Spectacular? No! More like Stupid Stupid.</fullReview>

After the first hour...the writing but dragged on...and on...and on....the elephant meledy is stunning...but after that musical numbers like "Like a Virgin" and "Roxanne" are horrible....the acting isn't much either except for Nicole Kidman who carries the film..I much preferred her role in the The Others..the writing is terribly predictable and nothing special either...Baz Luhrman tried to do something unique and artistic...all I got out of it was a headache....Moulin Rouge is one of those movies you either love or hate....I just think its a movie using pop songs and hot stars to get box-office bucks........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that most people either hate this movie or love it. I just can't understand how anyone could like anything about this movie. I admit I am not the biggest fan of musicals, but I can usually see how others can enjoy them and find something to appreciate. Musicals need good songs like West Side Story, good production like Oliver, or just silly fun like Grease. This had nothing. The hyperactive editing, garish colors and awful, awful music made this one of the worst movies I have ever seen, possibly worse than Battlefield Earth. While the whole genre is pretty goofy, a musical should at least have good choreography. It is impossible to tell if anyone is even dancing in this movie with all of the edits, camera angles, and effects. Many have mentioned how cheeky it is to use modern hits in this period piece. What most don't mention is how terrible those songs are. "Like A Virgin" is an awful song in any century!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How did this film ever become so acclaimed? Take a couple of stars, mailing it in, add oversaturated color backgrounds (possibly ripped off of the much-maligned "200 Motels"), toss in a few bizarre minor characters and non-sequitur scenes (again, done 30 years ago in "200 motels" without the self- indulgent pompousness), regurgitate as many lame top-40 songs of the last 20 years as possible (wait, that isn't ripped off of "200 Motels"- Frank Zappa made the effort to write new songs for his movie)- and, voila! A movie that is all obnoxious smoke and mirrors with no substance whatsoever.Baz Luhrmann is downright lazy- tossing back pop culture and lame comments about "love" without adding anything is profoundly unoriginal. At least when John Waters throws pop culture back at us, he has the creativity to put his unique satirical spin on it. Luhrmann just puts a couple of stars over his lazily produced dreck, tosses in a lot of color, and then throws it against the wall and sees if it sticks. What surprises me is that, for so many people, it did stick.</fullReview>

The story was unoriginal and mostly predictable, the songs mainly banal (though I admit there are few American musicals whose songs attract me much), and Ewan McGregor can't sing - he just opens his mouth too wide and sounds come out. Nicole Kidman made quite a good fist of her singing opportunities, though. She, and maybe Jim Broadbent's comic talent, were the only aspects of the film worth the trouble of sitting through it.

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with a great lot of aprehension. Having seen previously Romeo+Juliet, by the same director, I feared that his interesting ideas were again to be drowned in his visual incontinency. I was wrong: Moulin Rouge does not have a single idea to be drowned anywhere, just pure, empty, incontinency. William Shakespeare was not there to help the director out of his visual mess. Everything that could be bought by money (acting, art direction, costumes) is very good. But not a single idea, or a passion, or any of that sort, dares to surface in this long and boring piece. Curious enough for a movie that stammers about the difference between prostitution and love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! I have not seen a worse movie this year. Then of course I like reality too much. But if I want fantasy or escapism, I can see "Lord of the Rings" or a fine French movie "Ma Vie en Rose". This waste of celluloid has little to redeem it. The lone exceptions were the wonderful Jim Broadbent, the fine British actor, who seemed to be the only one in the farce that understood what being campy and over-the-top was. Nicole Kidman, with her smooth milk skin and lovely looks unfortunately is as interesting as a glass of milk. I was quite surprised how well Ewen MacGregor could sing. Or was that his voice? I am very capable of suspending my disbelief for a movie, but this mess, with its insertion of modern pop songs into turn of the century Paris was so forced and incongruous I left the room frequently (fortunately I didn't go to the theater for this). I know the whole rational of musicals generally using music that is not specific to the era of the musical itself (i.e. "Oklahoma), and the attempt was to be over the top and tongue in cheek; but I didn't have tongue-in-cheek; I had drool on cheek. 8.2 out of 10 on IMDB. What a disgrace! This film was a colossal waste of time, money, and energy. Poor Tom Cruise is all I can say. This obviously broke up the marriage. Or was it the simpering "Jerry McGuire"? At least Nicole took of her privates a bit in "Eyes Wide Shut", which displayed her only true attributes as an actress. I would have given it a zero on the voting scale, but they don't offer that.</fullReview>

It was filmed like some sort of horrible Mtv Hip-Hop video. They have nothing to show and no story to tell, so instead the film makers use very rapid edits and cuts to keep you glued to it like children to a video game. I can understand Nicole Kidman being in this, because she got to be the super-sexy star and romantic lead. Euwan McGregor will do any garbage nowadays as proved by the StarWars crap. I guess the millions of dollars are worth it, but if you added up all Ewan's dialog for the movies he's been in lately it might be the worst in Hollywood History.This movie was so bad that I was actually offended.Don't believe the Hollywood hype about this one.

		<fullReview>Ewan McGregor can surely sing! However, even his incredible talent cannot save this nightmare. After sifting through 45 minutes of disjointed pop remakes (after identifying the setting as 1900 Paris) and unusual camera angles, the viewer is finally rewarded with - gasp - a PLOT. (that is, if you were one of the patrons who did not walk out by this point. During the show I went to, 12 did.) The plot seemed to have a lot of promise. There are great acting performances in this film by both leads, but their love affair happens too quickly to ever be believable. They literally sing a remake and poof, both are in love. Nothing is surprising at this point. Maybe I missed the point of using pop music in a film about the Moulin Rouge, but it seemed to have no point whatsoever - other than, perhaps, reaching its target audience of young teens. It would also have been nice, since the film identifies Toulouse-Latrec, to have made him less of a buffoon and perhaps have mentioned (more than a brief second introduction) that he was an artist. If he could have been any buffoon, maybe he should have been someone without a world-renowned reputation. But if you want to see pop glorified, this is your film. You will not be disappointed by McGregor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie musical starring an unsexy sex symbol with an actor pretending to be a writer making up songs off the top of his head that are actually hacked from other musicals or pop songs, most of which were achingly bad in their original form. My wife wanted me to see this with her, and I just kept staring at her. Eventually, she was embarrassed by the bad call she made in picking this movie and wanted to leave, but I insisted that we stay to the end, and delighted in sharing the remaining 45 minutes of cinematic punishment. This movie is a textbook example of two phenomena. The first phenomenon occurs when the developers of a movie and its consumers convince themselves that a corporate-approved, non-threatening movie with talented actors and a big budget and flashy movement and costumes and the trappings of decadence must be a great movie since all the easily recognizable components of a great movie are covered in the "checklist of elements of great movies." This phenomenon actually works to some extent because the self-deception creates and moves the product. In the U.S., demand for Titanic was so high that copies went on sale in stores that had never sold a videotape before. At one point, everyone was telling me to see Titanic. Then everyone was telling me to buy Titanic. Then everyone told me not to bother. Now they sell on Ebay for US$1.00. By the time that most of you read this review, this process will have already occured to Moulin Rouge.The other phenomenon is when the creators of a film convince themselves that movies about superficial themes, like a Paris dance hall/whorehouse musical, can or should be superficial films, because there's the available defense of "of course it's a superficial film! This movie is ABOUT surface! Truth! Beauty! Freedom! Love!"What truth? The romantic element of the plot rung false. What beauty? Nicole Kidman is recurringly described in the American Press as "alluring," which is code for "really pretty, but not in a way that provokes an erotic response." What freedom? Everyone in this movie is a whore, and none of them seem to earn any grace or learn any worthwhile lessons. What love? I'm not sure what any of these characters really love or believe in.Maybe this film is escapist in a way that speaks to other people. Maybe my fellow US citizens are as superficial as this movie seems to assume they are. I doubt it. I've never been this negative in a film review before, because I only review films that I see to the end, and I would normally stop watching a film this bad.Good lord, what a dog. AMENDMENT: Apparently, there is some legitimate beauty in this film, as my wife assures me that Ewan MacGregor is a hot piece of beefcake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, there are not a lot of things to say or write about this movie as there are not a lot of things to say or write about it. I just "watched" it a few hours ago and my ears are still aching. This movie is loud. Everybody is yelling and running around. I really cannot say I watched this movie but I tried. And I tried hard. After about 30 minutes I fell asleep. Fortunately the screaming voices of the fat and ugly Moulin-Rouge dancers awoke me. I started forwarding to the next scene that seemed to be of any importance. Unfortunately it was the end. So I got back to the Moulin-Rouge jumping and screaming dancers and tried again to find something interesting. Actually I reduced the rest of the movie (about one hour) to 5 minutes.My tip: Reduce the whole thing to 10 minutes and make a music clip out of it. Or even better: cut all the dancing scenes, just keep McGregor and Kidman as main characters, slow all the pacing down and give it an open end. Oh sorry, someone just told me Dior already had this idea but Ewan McGregor wasn't available for the shooting.My unanswered questions: 1st - Where is the praised passion in this movie? You can find more passion in the eyes of Cary Grant kissing Eva Marie Saint in North by Northwest than in the whole Moulin-Rouge thing. 2nd - What is so sexy about this movie? The naked flesh you see from time to time?I still don't regret to have partly seen the movie. I discovered Ewan McGregor's lovely voice.</fullReview>

I hate most of the songs(so I'm a devotee of the Great American Songbook - sue me), the dances (which aren't THAT great, see the DVD) are obscured by MTV-on-speed cutting, the story, though 'mythical' is so thin and predictable that I cannot understand how anyone could be moved by this (or why it took Lurmann and his co-writer so long to get the story 'right' - it's a direct steal from La Boh?me/ La dame au Camélias). And though Ewan and Nicole's performances are decent, I am not a fan of either performer and really couldn't care less about them. So at the tragic finale I just laugh scornfully at the deliberate tearjerking instead of being (even slightly) moved. On top of this, the vulgarity and over-the-top camp act as total turnoffs for me. If someone wants to 'reinvent' the musical, why not DO IT LIKE THEY USED TO, going for real charm and delighting in the sensuousness of performance instead of having the director ego-trip the whole time through (why can't any director understand that in musicals THE PERFORMERS DANCE WHILE THE CAMERA STAYS STILL???!!!) Definitely one of the most irritating film experiences of the year. But what can one expect from a film which, while claiming to use the 'best ever songs of the twentieth century', opens with the abysmally wretched 'Nature Boy'???

		<fullReview>It is very suspicious situation when a director's last two movies are virtually stolen from the creative genius of others as Baz Luhrmann's Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and now Moulin Rouge can attest to. That said, Moulin Rouge was the type of theater experience in which your literally dying to go home and read the 6000 page War and Peace, read the entire 20,000 page IRS tax book, or rent the bottom 100 of all time film Freddy Got Fingered.  Nicole Kidman was visibly embarrassed when her selected scene as Satine was shown at the Academy Awards. And rightly so because the scene displayed exactly what she did throughout the entire Moulin Rouge debacle which was pant uncontrollably, fake orgasms, and lip synch songs that were better left behind to the forgettable 1980's. I'm not sure I've ever seen an actress nominated in a lead role for using so little dialogue. What an embarrasment to see Nicole Kidman contending with the likes of Halle Berry (she lifted Monster's Ball single-handedly to greatness) and Sissy Spacek (A difficult role for a gifted actress in In the Bedroom). And a word of advice to Ewan McGregor-you were miscast here and you'd be wise to stick to better roles like the one you had in Trainspotting. The most notorious thing I noticed in Moulin Rouge was how much I cringed in embarrassment for the gifted Jim Broadbent as a pimp daddy of sorts. This grandfather and Academy Award winner has always picked good roles (excellent British comedy shows, Bridget Jone's Diary, Iris) and why he relented to Baz Luhrmann I'll never know. I can only surmise that he is desperately trying to pay the mortgage on his 15- million dollar brownstone and was forced to stoop to this level. If only the relentless camera hadn't been so motivated to capture his oddly made-up face quite so closely. Whoever signed off on virtually making a mockery of Kurt Cobain's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" better be prepared to hear it from Kurt in heaven. I thought Madonna was smart enough to sell her songs to the highest bidder with some class, but she must have thought that Moulin Rouge reminded her of the good ole' days when she wore those pathetic cone bras and thought the world bowed only to her.  Moulin Rouge has an awfully high rating of 8.7 on the IMBD and I can only surmise that a bunch of little Brittany Spears-wannabe 10 year old's voted about a 100 times each. Never has a film stolen so much from previous songs, previous movies, previous musicals, and called itself inventive and inspired. The only thing inventive is the gold-digging scheme undertaken by Baz Luhrmann to produce and direct trash and market it as real art. If you want to watch a film that reinvented the musical with a classic work (Romeo and Juliet) but original songs, go rent the amazing West Side Story (1961) starring the deceased but incredible Natalie Wood. Not only is it a piece on race but it's a new idea. And yes, it thankfully lacks a slowly turning red wind mill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie as theater; an innovative and spectacular production.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an amazing movie. This is the case because it is a musical that is shot in film noir style. The movie is shot entirely in a studio, the cinematography employs all kinds of camera angles to set the mood, the story itself is highly theatrical and melodramatic and set in an underworld characterized by vice and corruption, and features a femme fatale who changes a man's life forever. Nicole Kidman's performance is remarkable. Not known as a singer and dancer, in this movie she sings, dances and plays the ultimate femme fatale. Kidman is proof that when provided the opportunity, Hollywood actors can excel. But what makes this movie unique is the way it was made. The director, Baz Luhrmann, decided to forego the conventional approach in favor of something innovative. This involved the superimposition of contemporary music onto a story set one hundred years earlier. To successfully pull off that kind of juggling act requires a huge amount of skill and Luhrmann succeeds. Not only does the mix work, it results in a story that is engaging, dynamic, and above all, honest. The movie is theater and presents itself as such, thus the audience is not misled. The movie succeeds in achieving a level of emotional intensity that is almost uncanny, considering the nature of the plot. This story is set entirely in a theater. The characters are actors being played by actors and the whole production risks becoming just another silly contrived piece of noise. But that does not happen here. Instead what Luhrmann produces is a masterpiece of drama shrouded in music and dealing with themes that can resonate with any audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragically and Heartbrakingly beautiful - For those artistic people out there, Watch this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most absolutely amazing, moving, tragically and heartbreakingly beautiful film/movie I have ever seen in my life. It's incredible compositions of music, choreography of dance and the whole plot in general leaves you sitting there in wonder, long after the film was over. Ewan Mcgregor could not have done better. He has an amazing voice and a charismatic presence that makes you fall in love with him from the moment he sings his first line "the hills are alive with the sound of music". Nicole Kidman did an incredible job at shaping into the character of Satine. She ended up having a very, very good voice as well. Both of their voices complimented each other. Ewan and Nicole did such a great job that you could actually believe what they were acting. It wasn't as if you were watching a film, but two people who loved each other so much,and overcame all obstacles. Well, nearly all of them...I loved all the actors in this movie, actually (maybe not all the "characters", like the Duke) It was extremely well written and I could literally watch it over and over again and still cry at the end. This is a rare film that actually takes you on a journey, all the while you're realizing new things every time you watch it. It's like you're falling in love with them all over again, feeling their pain and longing with them all over again. Maybe it's because I am a music fanatic (not really into musicals, but the Moulin Rouge is a definite exception)And a lover of Paris, but i extremely enjoyed this film and the music.For those people who say that this movie was "trash" and "horrible", or said things like "if you liked this, never watch a movie again", or any of that, I honestly see why they don't like it, and that is: This movie is for the open minded, artistic people of the world. If you're into unique, original and beautiful scenery, music, plot, cinematography that has NEVER been seen before in any other movie or book, then i recommend you watch this movie right away.If you're not, then don't even bother, although you are missing out on something amazing. I loved it, and i'm sure you will too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A better Titanic, but that doesn't mean much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate jukebox musicals. Not my thing. I also hate James Cameron's Titanic, a film with beautiful detail, but contains the most shallow love story ever. Good god it was boring. I came into Moulin Rouge with mixed expectations, and got the viewpoints of someone who loved it, and someone who hated it. I liked the film overall but there are some issues that I have with it that I won't spoil. The film is over the top, which for some can be jarring, especially with the editing and musical numbers. It does give the film a certain energy, but it gets old really quick. The plot is also put forth to us fairly quick, especially for a film that is 2 hours. The singing is eh, but my favorite sequence in the film uses "Roxanne" as a tango, and it is shot, choreographed, and sung well. I also enjoyed the set design and costumes, but the editing sometimes prevents me from looking at it. As a whole, I'd give Moulun Rouge a rental. I liked it, but I wish I could love it. However, I can say that is is infinitely better than Titanic.</fullReview>

Though I didn't like Moulin Rouge. I loved it.Moulin Rouge is like no other film experience. It has a wonderful style to it, good music,and good performances from Mcgregor and Kidman. And an interesting plot. A plot,a film, and a style that only a director with wonderful visionary skills can contain.Ewan Mcgregor plays an author who lives right next door to a club called The Moulin Rouge, which is a virlesque show. The lead dancer is played by Nicole Kidman, who confuses McGregor for being a duke. The Duke is paying to keep the club open. So she has to stay with him other wise he won't pay. One of the main things that earned Moulin Rouge it's Oscar nominations is the style. The style in Moulin Rouge is extraordinary. For most people, it was a mixed film experience. That's what I was wanting to believe for some reason. But in the end, Moulin Rouge is irresistible.Moulin Rouge: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This sensational one-of-a-kind spectacle took me completely by surprise and took me to an entirely different world, the dazzling surreal and quite overwhelming universe of the famous french nightclub of the title.There is something truly refreshing about Baz's work. It is so rich, elaborate and filled with such wonder and feeling. Each creation of his is just irresistible and is unlike any conventional film, therefore impossible to categorise it according to genre without disrespecting it.Critics usually express dislike of his films in their reviews as these pictures are not ones meant to be picked apart and analysed, but better watched openly and with an attitude that allows you to be entertained. They aren't ones that are really designed to be reviewed, and watching the clueless and pitiful critics' reaction is quite funny.Moulin Rouge! is certainly no exception, but unfortunately like the marvellous 'Australia" it is quite often unappreciated. Please avoid making such common mistakes and take the wonderful opportunity as I have, and I have never been felt happier!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just do not understand the photographic intent in this film; the great dance scenes cut into tiny epileptic shreds, and the close-up face scenes intolerably slow, like the prelude of Tarkovsky's Solaris. Why the fast cuts? Is there a global lack of dancers today capable to keep a pose longer than a quarter of a second. In comparison Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers did their whole dance numbers in just one take, Mr Astaire was a perfectionist though. Still, it can be verified that face shots does not become more dramatic by time alone.Neither the characters of Satine, nor Christian manages to attract my sympathy, and the Duke is too plain; more like a clown. Maybe intentionally, but since this is a fairy tale, I would appreciate the villain to be more of a character.Finally a potpourri is a potpourri is a potpourri. Why not put some effort in giving this film its own music, instead of the mishmash of great love songs it ended up with. Waste your time on "All that Jazz" or "Cabaret" instead, at least they got an interesting plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a "theatre geek", I was awfully disappointed with this film. Yet again, Baz Luhrmann's cinematography takes center stage, his fast-paced camera movements and bright flashy set design overshadowing his characters and story.First, I must say I've never been a big fan of Baz. In my mind, his masterpiece was "Strictly Ballroom". There was a balance between visuals and story that made it a truly great movie. Then came "R+J". Shakespeare for the MTV teenage-set. While I admired the idea, I held no love for the finished product.And the same could be said here. "Moulin Rouge!" is nothing more than a splashy, musical rendition of "The Lady of the Camillias". Most tragic is that while I adore Ewan and Nicole, I can't help but notice their lack of singing talent. And the same could be said for every other actor involved. However, I am relieved that the musical numbers consisted of shallow pop tunes. If I had to listen to Nicole Kidman attempt to sing the music of Porter, Kander &amp; Ebb, or Sondheim, I'd be deaf.For the sake of the "Movie Musical", I wanted this film to succeed. However, I was left feeling nothing but pity for the genre. So much so that I was prepared to loathe "Chicago" (definitely my favorite stage show) and was wonderfully surprised.I really admire Luhrmann's attempt, however I think he's better off sticking to original material. If you want to see a great musical, watch "Singin' in the Rain" (essential) or "Cabaret". And if you enjoy the story of "Moulin Rouge!", watch "Camille". No one can beat Greta Garbo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Luhrmann is great when he's not artistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone claims this film is a musical, but it's more like a documentary. The song and dance routines seem to be a dress rehearsal where the leads were off sick. On Broadway, a show can get away with thin characterization and story through live interaction, distance from the stage, and lack of background elements. But in a film these glaring errors come back to haunt the film. Of course the irony is that the movie was staged and shot theatrically, without talented performers. Actors that are skilled and successful in mainstream film were woefully miscast. You can't hide the fact through slick cutting, electronically enhanced voices, odd angles (we were almost on the Titantic), and pop tunes that are a one trick dark pink pony.Many people enjoyed the film and it was even nominated for Best Film, but I firmly believe that it was because of how unusual it was and "what" the film had to say, but unusual doesn't mean good and thorough analysis would bring that to light. My goal is not to tear down films that had ingenuity but a hope that the common filmgoer won't get ripped off going to the cinema.In a musical, the audience has a right to see song and dance and not actors parading around as performers. The only exception is Frank Sinatra because he worked hard to refine his persona (and possibly Elvis Presley in Viva Las Vegas). Fred Astaire knew this and prevented directors from being creative by putting in his contract that he can only be shot in long shot. He gave the audience a value-added performance-not some actor singing in the shower. Granted some of Astaire's scene were too long, but his performance never ceases to impress. Why do you think slapstick is dead? No one wants to do stunts and pratfalls like in the early days. I know it's a "postmodern" world but we're still the same homo sapiens who are suckers for a good 'ole song and dance routine with funny (or classy) outfits.To be fair, the art design and visual compositions (when they were long enough to notice) were carefully laid out. I appreciate the production allowing Cinefex to cover them. Nicole Kidman is stunning and alluring (whatever that truly means). But don't kid yourself this is just a modern update of Cabaret which is a classic, set in a real era that deals with weighty issues.A message to anyone attempting to be Bob Fosse: Don't. You'll trip and fall and break your leg. But all I can say is smoke a few pack of cigarettes, dress in black, and watch his films. If you aim high enough, you're bound to hit a mullet rouge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recognize that everyone has different tastes but how can this film rank amongst imdb.com user's Top 250 of all time? There seems to be quite a few negative reviews from users on this site...I felt so embarrassed for Nicole Kidman in her first scene with Ewan McGregor in the elephant. Probably the stupidest "Three's Company"-style innocent-discussion-mistaken-as-sexual-innuendo situation I've ever seen. Did this film have to beat me over the head with "the greatest thing you'll ever learn..." and the 4 tenets of the bohemian way of life. God, I get it already! Love is great."Your Song" is beautiful. But let's face it; wouldn't you rather listen to Elton John sing it? Sorry Ewan, your singing just doesn't cut it. As for the scenes in the club, does loud driving dance beat make for a good musical? I'm not a fan of musicals but I'm afraid that was probably the best part of this completely uninteresting "love story".If the insipid attempts at humor hadn't petered out toward the second half of the movie I could see this becoming a "Rocky Horror" style campy cult flick, but it's just too boring. My ratings -- songs: 5; love story: 2; general storyline: 1. Simply terrible.</fullReview>

It was loud, the plot was utterly predictable (I didn't need to see the end to know what happened), the "modern songs with period sets" was simply a gimmick without purpose, the pace was unnecessarily frenetic, and worst of all, THE MUSIC STUNK. I can deal with most of the other stuff, but when I watch a musical, I want the music to be good. Duh. Whoever says that Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor can sing are tone deaf. I'm a musician, and I know good music. This is not it.Want a "I never knew he/she could sing!" movie? Michelle Pfeiffer in "Fabulous Baker Boys" does OK (not great). John Travolta in "Grease". Tom Hulce (Mozart in "Amadeus") in "The Hunchback of Notre Dame."Want a fast-paced, off-the-wall edited, frenetic movie? Requiem for a Dream.Want a good musical? Little Shop of Horrors. Any Disney animation. The Wizard of Oz. The Sound of Music. Singing in the Rain. Heck, even Purple Rain (OK, it's more of a musical documentary, and the acting stinks, but you get my point).Want good Ewan McGregor? Trainspotting. Even Phantom Menace.Want good Nicole Kidman?

		<fullReview>Once in a while a movie comes along that manages to be all things to all people. Well . . . . almost. Remember that you can't please all of the people all of the time. Anyway, this movie is one of those films. It pleased me and a good many other cinema fans, it pleased the critics, it even managed to convert some detractors once they had given it a go. It was a musical, a comedy, a love story, a piece of theatre. It was all of those separate parts and yet so much more, amazingly enough.The story is *deep breath* all about a young writer (played by Ewan McGregor) who falls in love with a courtesan (Nicole Kidman) while she mistakenly believes he is a duke (played by Richard Roxburgh) after being introduced by Toulouse-Lautrec (played by John Leguizamo) and then when the misunderstanding is cleared up it's on with the show as everyone involved tries to stage a spectacular spectacular at the titular Moulin Rouge (owned by Harold Zidler, played by Jim Broadbent) but the writer and courtesan are still in love despite the forthcoming attentions of the jealous duke so the stage is all set for farce, deceit, love, envy, heart-warming moments and possible heart-ache *deep breath once again*.Baz Luhrmann is now done with all of this, it's the last instalment of his "Red Curtain" trilogy and he really must be applauded for the culmination of his ideas and dreams. Putting together a stellar cast is just the icing on the cake. What this movie really revels in is the blend of old and new music (some just used for one line or the briefest of snippets) and the layers within the movie that present us with different realities - that between viewer and screen, screen and story, story and play within the story. It's like a Russian Doll revealing more each time you open it and rewards the viewer with almost every re-watch.Yes, some people have complained about the MTV-style of editing and choreography but while I can see the reasoning behind this complaint I simply cannot agree with it myself. This movie IS quick, sharp and yearning to catch up with 100 different moments at once but that's not to satisfy those with short attention spans. It's because there is just so much crammed into every scene and every single frame. And I, for one, absolutely love every second of it.See this if you like: William Shakespeare's Romeo &amp; Juliet, Singin' In The Rain, Everyone Says I Love You.</fullReview>

The best that can be said about this it is that it was somewhat visually interesting, but that isn't nearly enough to carry a film. The plot (loosely based on Camille) was virtually nonexistent, allowing the soundtrack to carry the story. Perhaps if the singing wasn't so bad, that might have worked, but in this case, it did NOT.This film was so bad that I couldn't see it all the way through.

Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor and Jim Broadbent do reasonable jobs with their roles, but I personally thought that John Leguizamo as Toulouse-Lautrec was the neatest character in the movie. And the ending was a little anti-climactic.Considering that many of the songs used here were once spoofed by "Weird Al" Yankovic, it seems that they could make a spoof of this movie featuring his versions.

I suspect that the cast and director were having so much fun making this train-wreck of a musical, that no-one wondered how long its appeal would last for.In a century's time, people will still dress up, then sit grimly in opera houses and endure "La Boheme" sung in a foreign language because it's a "classic".

There is one thing in this film which makes it even worse and that is Nicole Kidman. She drives me nuts what with all her popularity. Her singing drives me mad; better sounds have come from buttocks than from her mouth. And the worst thing is, out of every three films that come out in the cinema, one is almost certain to have Kidman in it. Anyway back to the film, it contains a very nice song called "Nature Boy", of which a very nice version was made a long time ago by Nat "King" Cole, but in the film, they have a version of it which is so bad that when I saw the film I had to make a desperate struggle to avoid myself from bursting into tears of pity for Nat "King" Cole and all the other good artists who recorded the song.

		<fullReview>Don't let the so-called movie experts fool you. This movie is the biggest piece of garbage ever conceived. Nicole Kidman is the most overrated actress in movie history. She does nothing that would even earn Oscar consideration, let alone a nomination. The music scenes are confusing and has too many songs overlapping. Here's a tip, start a song, continue that song, and finish the song. Then move on to the next song. I don't think this movie helped Chicago win Best Picture this year because Moulin Rouge is simply a bad film. I haven't seen Chicago, but it has to be better than this junk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie ever made (kinda spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friends and I like to get together just to talk about this one. We've had several conversations just debating the finer points of what make this movie so terrible. We have an insanely confusing plot - OK, Nicole Kidman seduces the wrong guy? None of us even figured that out until way at the end of the movie, after spending a seemingly endless amount of time wondering what was going on. It is filled with other people's music that range from annoying ("So exciting!") to horrible and pointless ("Roxanne"). Five and a half hours of meaningless dreck. Loved only by swooning girls and pompous film critics. I think I actually want to see it again, just to confirm all the main reasons it's horrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(warning: possible spoilers ahead)How can a movie that has a cliche plot, undeveloped characters, cheesy settings, overdone costumes, and no shots that last longer than 3 seconds get voted to be such a great movie? I have no idea. I barely sat through the movie and finished watching it only due to a crazy new year's resolution. It actually hurts to watch it. What most describe as "a beautiful mix of color and music" is really, well, not. The closest thing I can compare it to is mixing beautiful colors of paint until they turn into ugly greyish-brown color that may remind some of waste and excretions. The only reason I'm writing about Moulin Rouge! is because I hated it so much and actually, I'm disgusted with myself to even write anything more. Please don't see this movie - it has no value as a piece of art whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently my wife and I saw Moulin Rouge and I have to be the first to admit how wrong I could be. When she mentioned she wanted to see this film, I thought "oh God! This is going to be horrible!" and boy was I ever wrong.This has to be the worst movie ever released (I am talking worse than such bad flicks as Yor, Armed and Dangerous, and even any cheese late night b-movie on Showtime.) I hardly could stand the sight of this so-called "artistic wonderment" without wondering to myself if it was possible to have this film banned as a cruel and unusual punishment.I have no idea why anyone would consider this movie a "GREAT" film other than those who spend their time talking about the esoteric qualities of Dadaism and the writings of Voltaire.The plot (?) was highly predictable and the characters were less evolved than those from "Dude, Where's My Car?" The only thing that could have made this film worse is the addition of the "cut-scenes" that are provided on the DVD version.I hate to be so harsh on this film that it seems has found some fan-friendly audience but I would rather wish that my friends live with a colostomy bag than to see this movie.</fullReview>

The acting was poor, the siging worse and the choice of music bizarre. I really cannot understand how this film could be nominated for oscars and other awards.

		<fullReview>I haven't paid to see such a bad film in many a year.Let me start with what I liked: Ewan McGregor is very attractive &amp; a good actor, and I generally like John Leguizamo (although I did not like the way they portrayed Toulese-Latrec as just some gay stereotype). The only other plus - the costumes &amp; mise-en-scene were very well-done (although I'm sure totally inaccurate).Otherwise it was so horrible, I almost wish I had paid to see "the Animal" instead. I don't like musicals, but I can usually put up with the genre. Now I could be wrong, but wasn't Ewan McGregor lip-syncing? What pained me the most was the anachronistic use of '80's songs/song lyrics (Nirvana, Madonna &amp; the Police to name a few) -- was just too much for me.It was the utter rejection of any realism that annoyed me. The lovers float up among Disney-like stars &amp; sprinkles (even their clothes change). A gun comes out of window &amp; flies across (a computer simulated) Paris to strike the Eiffel Tower. I'm willing to grant a lot of poetic license (for example, a realistic victim of consumption hacking up lots of blood &amp; completely emaciated would not have been good) - and certainly in a musical, we expect people to just randomly burst into song &amp; dance -- but some semblance of normality would've been nice.The writing was mediocre at best. Probably because the were dealing with a terribly trite plot.I'll spare you further and more specific complaints, because I can't bear to even contemplate this film anymore. I simply had to add a warning as a counterpoint to the comment I saw posted here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bohemian revolutionist Christain falls for sexy singer Satine in this beautiful, fun yet heartbreaking tale of beauty, truth and above all else, love. The story follows Christian moving to France to be in the midst of Bohemain revolution, to write about love. The only problem? He has never been in love. He gets involved with a production called Spectacular Spectacular, a truly Bohemain play about love conquering all else, but needs to get permission to write the play from Harold Zeigler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge. In order to do this, he must meet Satine, posing as a famous English writer and convince her to talk to Zeigler about him writing the production. When she mistakes him for a rich duke who's keen to invest, she seduces him and falls in love with him. They then embark on a beautiful love story, but this can only result in heartbreak... This is a beautiful tale that you cannot help but fall in love with. The music is contemporary and sung beautifully, the acting is superb and the storyline is enjoyable and very believable. All in all, Moulin Rouge is a gift to musical lovers everywhere.</fullReview>

Maybe this was what was being shown on 9/11 and this is why the planes flew into the Twin Towers. Anything to end the horror of seeing this mawkish teenage drivel.Dreadful music, stupid plot, tenth-rate (no, I'll amend that) twentieth-rate acting. It is utterly amazing that this film has become popular. And what a cheek to steal the title of a perfectly good 1950s biopic (the one with José Ferrer as Toulouse-Lautrec and the nice Mantovani music). Truly a dreadful film and a waste of space. If I had to replace the word "dreadful" in this review, I would choose "boring". Or maybe "banal". Or why not all three?</fullReview>

I'd heard from several people it was their favorite movie, and though I was too young to see it at the time, remember what a huge deal it was when it first came out, as well as being nominated for many awards. I was surprised to read these comments that said it was like an 'acid trip.' I figured they just didn't understand originality. But they were right!! It reminded me of when I have high fevers and hallucinate! It made literally no sense until the end. It wasn't that the plot line was bad, it was that it was intertwined by such weird and almost disturbing scenes and dizzying camera angles that you were just like 'what?!?' How could this be anyone's favorite movie? It just is so...dream like...weird unconnected things thrown together. Attempts at humor (the narcoleptic Argentinian) fall totally flat because humor doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the movie, and serious scenes elicited huge laughs from me and my friend because they were so...odd and ridiculous. Don't see this movie. And I don't think I'm being too harsh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Moulin Rouge!" created so much hype in 2001 I'm still surprised I never got around to seeing it. Although Nicole Kidman was already famous, this was one of her first major successes after her split from hubbie Tom Cruise - the fact that it became such a global phenomenon only sparked more tabloid crap - "Kidman Bigger Than Cruise" and the likes. This only fueled the popularity of the movie and it became something of a cultural sensation. You couldn't go anywhere without hearing about it.Four years later and the noise has settled. I finally got around to watching the movie on television and left my expectations at the door. As such, I was pleasantly surprised by just how fun the movie actually is - visually it's a feast for the eyes, packed with dazzling extravagance. Director Baz Luhrmann ("Romeo + Juliet") expands upon his directorial flair and theatrics - this comes across as somewhat of a sequel to his Shakespeare remake. (Indeed, the modern soundtrack compliments it nicely.) The story is kind of nostalgic - a worker at France's "Moulin Rouge", played by Nicole Kidman, falls in love with a poet (Ewan McGregor). They are not allowed to be together but they cannot resist their feelings for each other."Moulin Rouge" isn't a perfect film but the plot is fairly interesting, the characters are likable, the songs are wonderful and visually it's on the scale of a Gilliam film - magical and huge.I would never say it's a "great" movie but I would recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've tried to watch this film three times and can't make it past about forty-five minutes. The frenetic pace, outrageous costumes and bizarre use of music make it impossible to focus on anything. As near as I can tell, it is a rip-off of La Boheme with no music worth listening to combined with some of the people from the "real" Moulin Rouge. While I like Nicole Kidman, Jim Broadbent and Ewan McGregor, their roles here are just cartoon characters. The Leguizamo character is impossible to understand and easy to forget. Overall, I'd say Moulin Rouge is much like a "Xanadu" remake without any disco or roller skates. Perhaps one needs to be drunk to really enjoy the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overkill of lights, fast cameras and tasteless music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all; I love music. Music isn't just a hobby for me, its a passion. Moulin Rouge is the single most terrible musical experience I've had. And yes, I enjoy most different types of quality music. The music of MR has been praised as innovative and exciting, but I have to disagree. The songs have been chosen by only one criteria; to be as easy for the audience as possible. It seems that any interesting songs, if there was any, have been dismissed in the pre-production stage in fear of losing audience. There was not one single song that would've surprised me in the movie. And yes, changing the words so they are aligned with the plot is one of the oldest tricks in the book. The fact that Moulin Rouge has been compared to some of the real musicals of our era is sickening. At least they tried to compose something new for the audience before...The plot was 90% predictable. The last 10% is made out of the scenes, which reach even deeper into the syrup than I thought was humanly possible. And when the music/dancing scenes were not powerful enough, hey, it's not a problem. By the rules of Moulin Rouge, there isn't a problem that couldn't be fixed by adding another 10 million light bulbs and flashlights, 50 extra dancers and perhaps a modulation in the song. Sorry, doesn't fix it for me.Third of all, Nicole Kidman is beautiful, but in my opinion she really wasn't convincing as the beauty queen of Moulin Rouge.All in all, except for the overkill of lights, fast cameras and tasteless music, Moulin Rouge didn't show anything we hadn't seen (as better versions) before. This movie surely was an unique experience for me, and I don't want to have that experience again...ever.</fullReview>

Yes I was that obsessed that my whole life revolved around scheduling viewings of Moulin Rouge to watch and laugh and cry and be utterly captivated by every moment of this movie.8 years later I am now deeply aware that this is a flawed and rather shallow movie but to deny the effect this movie had on me would be blasphemy. I still adore the soundtrack but now in a way adore the original songs more I still watch it from time to time but now I would probably describe my favorite movie as Two Lovers, Saving Private Ryan, Memento or Nightmare before Christmas, though no movie has ever left me as breathless as this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is not a movie that i believe will stand the test of time. Yes, it probably revived the 'musical' genre and got us all ready for Chicago (great!) and later The Phantom of the Opera (bad), but...Unfortunately i think Baz Luhraman's film is too cut up, too haphazard, too fast. The "energy" of the film isn't bottled up to create a huge explosion but rather little fireworks here and there. Perhaps this is why i didn't really connect, or care about the characters and their fates. Undoubtedly Nicole Kidman is suited to the part of Satine as are her costars to their own parts. I would have preferred her winning her Oscar for this rather than her overrated "The Hours" performance where she was was shown up by costars Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep (in my humble opinion). But then again i still haven't seen Halle Berry in Monsters Ball (who won the Oscar, the year Kidman was nominated for MR)</fullReview>

And this film is particularly rubbish.Some of the sets are well crafted - why this gets a 2/10 rather than a 1/10 for me - but both Kidman and McGregor are annoying and embarrass themselves with the singing roles as this drags on.And on.And on.And on.Yawnfest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shamefully Bad; An Appalling Half-Attempt at Making a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sick of Baz Luhrmann. The overly surreal director has ruined the world of films with his dreadful "Red Curtain" trilogy, a trifecta of nauseatingly colorful and gapingly overdone "films" that pass for art fare in a world where "Sin City" is considered Oscar material. "Moulin Rouge" is a peculiar musical which incorporates an abysmal story with the anachronistic use of several popular 20th-century songs-- a feat which we're supposed to view as genius. Sadly, the songs are terrible. With, that is, the exception of "Roxanne," which is horrifyingly mangled in a performance by a man who desperately needs to clear his throat. Every acting performance in this movie comes across as something no director with a frontal lobe in his brain would ever let pass. The worst offenders are Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, whose terrifyingly horrid turns just defy description. Go away, Baz. Either that or start really trying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Rouge is a film you HAVE to see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the film Moulin Rouge came out in the cinemas in September 2001, I had just turned 12 the month before, and I never really went to the cinema, so I can't think what motivated me to go to see this film. When I saw it****************OH MY GOD****************** I had never come out at the end of a film feeling so....SPARKLY. It left such a magical feeling inside me, which sounds ridiculous because it's just a film. I thought the colours, the detail, the characters and the story were amazing, and the music was out of this world. It was like it was the movie I had been waiting my whole life to see, my dream. Until then I had never heard of any of the actors in it, and I became comically obsessed with all of them. My favourite is Nicole Kidman, she is the best actress ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Worthless Excuse for a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just plain old drivel.No sane individual would create such a piece of garbage,and no person in their right mind would enjoy it.Some people say,"well it was a musical".It still sucked as a musical most of those actors/actresses couldn't sing to begin with.If you wanted to put it out as a musical put it in a theater.They hyped the film up to be something it couldn't even come close too.Maybe next time spend your time and money on creating a decent movie and not on hype.All those theaters waisted peoples time and money.They should all have been fined for false advertisement and for selling a "defective" product. Whoever created that hogwash should be ashamed of themselves and should never be allowed to make another film.If I were ever to see said individual on the street I would have to hold myself back from punching them in the face.Thanks for waisting my time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am so pleased that I didn't go to see this film at the cinema.I would have been distressed to have paid a fiver to see one of the worst films ever made. Truly awful. Don't bother wasting your time watching this.The music was anachronistic. The story was non-existent. The only highlight was Nicole Kidman. The only reason I thought about watching this rubbish was because she was in it.If this is ever on the TV again, I'll find something else to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What this dumpster of pop dreck needs is Austin Powers. This movie panders to the very lowest common denominator of intelligence &amp; taste &amp; demonstrates fully why actors, no matter how much fame &amp; lucre they may garner, or how pretentious their senses of mission, are still sad &amp; pathetic creatures who will perform their tricks, no matter how abasing, for some momentary &amp; meaningless attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I paid money to see this??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My husband and I and some friends rented this movie the other night, as none of us had seen it and we heard it had been nominated for an Academy Award. We kept waiting for the "good part"...and waiting, and waiting, and waiting. I wish I'd had a camera to capture the "HUH???" looks on all of our faces.I read in another comment that people who didn't have a sense of humor wouldn't like this movie. Let me tell you, we laughed. A lot. The inane use of cheesy song lyrics of the 70s made for loads of belly laughs because it was so HOKEY. Other songs/lyrics incorporated into the dialog just made us shake our heads and roll our eyes.We came near to shutting off the movie several times as the gaudy, dizzying visuals made us sick. We miraculously made it to the terrible ending of this movie (Spoiler alert) where we were shouting at Christian to go home and listen to his father...find a nice girl!!I guess this is the MTV version of the musical. It made us want to go rent a real one, as this doesn't even deserve to be in the same genre as some of the truly great musicals of our time.If this piece of junk wins the Academy Award, I will not be surprised, but it will be a big disappointment, and further indication of how low we can sink if this crap is considered to be fine entertainment.I refuse to award this any stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How gloriously camp this drivel is. Remember Riverdance and Lord Of The Dance and how everyone thot it was so cool at the time? The same applies to this movie. And the story is up to very little indeed, in fact it is like Grease mixed with Luhrmann's version of R+J. Very weak and totally unoriginal.A movie is a movie and musicals are musicals. Plain and simple. Any attempt to merge the 2 have never been met with successful results in my opinion. If you want ironclad proof just take a look at Bollywood. This should have seriously just been a Broadway hit and not a big screen hit. But, of course, if every critic and every woman who sees this with all over her girlfriends like it and if they rave about how good it is because everyone else says it is great and they only went to see it because people are telling them that it is a great movie (fact!) then they are only going to watch the great movie that it everyone says that it is. Me? I just watch the movie for what it is. No bias or pre-movie opinions. And what I saw was a stinker.Almost everything in this movie seems so forced and shoved in our faces. Every shot is cluttered with overly decorated sets, too many occurrences and detail to register with us in 2 seconds cuts (I ain't seeing it twice if that's the idea), heinous ADR that is about as unconvincing as Orson Welles masquerading as Mickey Mouse, VERY bad CGI that Luhrmann seems to be in love with and too many androgynous and weird looking characters.This film is all visual, or, if I were unoriginal (like the movie) I would say all style and no substance. Take away the indulgent and increasingly annoying sets/backdrops and all the jumping around and dancing and you are left with?what? A tedious movie that is good only because people say it is good. Another victim of `Insider Syndrome'. For me, every set in a movie should, at the same time, be realistic and reflect tone and mood of the scene. EVERY-SINGLE-SET in Moulin Rouge is overly-decorated to the point that we cannot tell what the set is. They are and eyesore, ugly to look at and extremely garish. A representation of everything this movie stands for: indulgence, ego, campiness and pointless extravagance. Lowest marks?sorry.Oh and one last thing?how come no one speaks French in France?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...this is basically for people who have already seen it......heres what i think about the characters......ewan MacGregor was amazing. i almost fell out of my seat in awe after i nearly peed my pants. i had no idea that he could sing! how wonderful life is, now that hes in the world!......nicole kid mans acting was superb, but i don't understand why she had to be singing. who said that she could sing. she is almost always off key, and her squeaker voice really annoyed me and my friends. who'd she have to sleep with to get that role? I'm glad she wasn't cast in the role as Ula in the producers......that midget guy! i don't know if you've noticed but in every single movie there is the same guy. he is famous in Hollywood without the name. every single movie that has a midget in it is played by that guy. i swear hes gonna be famous in 10 years and were all gonna be like, "hey your that freak from Molina rouge"......the duke disappointed me, he was way too nice...so thank you for reading my comments</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Rouge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen many emotional love stories, I have seen many heart warming musicals, and when the two are combined, you have a magnificent film, from BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Baz Luhrmann (Romeo + Juliet). It is 1899 in Paris, and aspiring young poet Christian (Golden Globe nominated Ewan McGregor) ignores his father's wishes, and joins the colourful, slightly dark underworld of the legendary Moulin Rouge club, run by Harold Zidler (BAFTA winning Jim Broadbent). While he is there, he not only has passion to create new art for the rich audiences of men, along with his friends and co-creators including Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo), but he starts a passionate affair with the highest paid star and most famous courtesan, Satine (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Nicole Kidman). Their romance is carried out in the club, but what makes their love a tragedy is the nasty Duke (Richard Roxburgh) saying he will only pay for the show, Spectacular Spectacular if Satine is his, love is forbidden in the Underworld, and more tragic, she is slowly dying of her illness (internal bleeding). The ending is not only a fantastic musical with passionate singing from McGregor and Kidman (well, all their singing is magnificent), but it has the tear-jerking ending with Satine dying in Christian's arms, and he finishes his story about this (he was writing about it). Also starring Garry McDonald as The Doctor, Jacek Koman as The Narcoleptic Argentinean, Matthew Whittet as Satie, The Lord of the Rings' David Wenham as Audrey and Kylie Minogue as The Green Fairy with the voice of Ozzy Osbourne. I think the film is also clever for the period story and characters singing modern love and pop culture songs in int, e.g. "I Will Always Love You", "Love Lifts Us Up", "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend", "Lady Marmalade" (which Christina Aguilera, Pink, Lil Kim, Mya and Missy Elliot adapted fantastically) and of course, the great couple song, the Golden Globe nominated "Come What May", which was number 85 on 100 Years, 100 Songs. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Makeup, Best Sound and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Craig Armstrong and Marius De Vries and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Original Screenplay, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Best Original Score. Nicole Kidman was 21, and Ewan McGregor number 9 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, McGregor was also number 2 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was number 25 on 100 Years of Musicals, and it was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Hate Musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the exception of PINK FLOYD`S THE WALL I`ve always hated musicals . It`s the whole camp concept of men and women talking sensibly one moment and springing about like muppets on acid the next . Got your eye on a babe you fancy like mad lads ? Then sing to her and do a little hot shoe shuffle next time you see her boys , she will never forget you in much the same way she`ll never forget being mugged , or finding her previous lover in bed with her best friend You can see the point I`m making can`t you ? Musicals are silly and unrealistic and MOULIN ROUGE is no exception so I don`t really have to say why I disliked this film because it found it more silly and unrealistic than most musicals I`ve seen . I do recognise that there is a fair amount of cheek and temerity involved of having late 20th century pop songs in a film set in Paris in 1900 along with other post modernist anachronisms , and there is much technical worth in the areas of editing , cinematography and costume design , but I found MOULIN ROUGE to be a cheesy mess and turned off after 40 minutes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning and inventive, cool soundtrack and great love story ? but John Leguizamo's cartoon antics must go...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>English writer Christain finds himself introduced to the heady pleasures of the Moulin Rouge burlesque and to the fabulous beauty of the tragic Satine. Christian finds himself in a case of mistaken identify when Satine seduces him instead of the Duke (the potential backer for Satine's chance to star in a play). Before the mistake is realised Christian is in love and must struggle with envy while Satine plays along with the Duke in return for his money. But will love win out?Maybe I suffered from the hype but I was a tad disappointed in this film. At the heart it has a beautiful love story between Satine and Christian which has added spice due to her commitment to the Duke and her potential death from consumption. This side of the story plays well but the rest of it is almost like a cartoon. The cartoon/comedy side is fun too but it takes away from the love story.The director is great ? he did it with Romeo &amp; Juliet and he does it here. He has such an imagination and the film is a real joy to watch ? so clever, so inventive. But he has also allowed characters in that create a cartoon feel ? Toulouse-Lautrec and his fellow actors are prime examples. I found that this took away from my enjoyment slightly as it pushed some scenes from being imaginative and different into being silly.That said I still enjoyed the film. The central story is fantastic and visually it is amazing. The music is superb as well ? going from one style to the next, with absurd scenes to beautiful scenes (`Your Song' is my favourite scene, I could watch it 100 times!). Occasionally it doesn't work but it is audacious in the attempt.The cast are mostly great. Kidman and McGregor are both on top form and aquit themselves well ? both in the singing and the acting stakes. Jim Broadbent is good value as Harold, the club owner and Roxburgh gives a wonderfully smarmy performance as the Duke. John Leguizamo was good in Romeo &amp; Juliet, and Lurman should have left it there ? nobody can get two good performances out of this guy. His cartoon antics don't seem out of place in the first half of the film ? but when the mood changes he is left mugging and being irritating. He has some good moments ? but I really think that the guy needs to only do serious roles until he loses that irritating habit of mugging.Overall I thought this was a brave, inventive film that has a wonderful story at it's heart. However it is maybe hyped too much and I found that the cartoon antics of some of the characters were irritating rather than involving. But I still really enjoyed it!</fullReview>
