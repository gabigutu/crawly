		<shortDescription>one of the most important movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while a movie comes out that has something to say. It has something to offer that is more than just Hollywood. It believes in something. In recent years movies like Dances With Wolves, JFK, Falling Down, Malcolm X, Boyz and The Hood and Saving Private Ryan are recent ones that come to mind. They make us examine who we are and what we are doing here and why we do the things that we do. They make us question our actions and they show us that we are perhaps not as great as we thought we were. Movies like this don't come around too often and that's because they have things to say that not only people don't like to hear, but because they don't want to know. Dances With Wolves made me feel guilty to be a white man, Instinct made me ashamed to be a human being.There is a line in one of Pearl Jams songs that says " I don't question our existence, I just question our modern needs. " You will not find more profound lyrics than those ones and this movie takes that same idea and explores it deeper. It shows us the greedy nature of man and how destructive we all are. But it also shows us how beautiful it all once was, and how it all changed.This movie has been so unfairly critisized by everyone from the media to even other people in this very forum that don't seem to understand what it is all about. By now we all know the story of how Anthony Hopkins goes to the jungle and lives among the gorillas and then ends up murdering people. But what we don't know is why he does it. How he gets to that fateful moment and what it is that makes him, a peaceful man, want to kill another human being.The strengths in this movie are numerous but it starts with the performances. Hopkins is quietly brilliant as the emotionally traumatized and scarred former anthropologist. You can feel his pain even before he tells what it is that is eating away inside of him. Cuba Gooding is great as the doctor that goes on a journey with Ethan Powell. At first his interest in Powell is simply one of selfishness. But as he learns more about this complex man, the more he understands and empathizes with him. Also good in his role as the brutal prison guard is John Ashton ( remember him from Beverly Hills Cop? ). His character is very reminiscent of Clancy Brown's in Shawshank Redemption but he is very good here. But the real strength of the film is in the story and the screenplay.The two writers for the film care about what it is that they have to say and they believe in it. You can feel what it is that they are trying to convey. And that is simply: why must we as human beings be so destructive? Why must we be so hateful and greedy and why do have to ruin everything that was once pure and serene? The scenes in this film that are meant to ask for your sympathy are not just gratuitous violence to sell tickets, they are there because things like this happen in real life and we never do anything to stop it. And that is a shame.Denzel Washington's character in " The Siege " said, " You don't let any murderer go free. ANY MURDERER!!! " Well Hopkin's character was punished for his crime but what about the men that murdered those that weren't human? What crime have they committed? And what punishment do they receive for the act of murder against something that isn't human? There is no punishment. And that is what makes us sad individuals and that is what this movie is trying to tell us.Give this movie a chance. It really is a gem and hopefully it will open just one person's eyes and ask them to change. If it can do that, then it has done it's job. I applaud everyone associated with this movie. I just wish more studios and directors and actors would have the guts to do this. I just hope some people can see this movie for what it is and not for what we critisize it for trying to be. And as melo-dramatic as this review may sound to some people and as melo-dramatic as this is also going to sound, it has to be said.Thank you John Turtletaub for making this movie. You moved me and made me think about a great many things. I hope I'm not alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sincerely believe this movie has been under-rated. Instinct is one of the best movies I have ever seen.

		<fullReview>This film really surprised me. I mean REALLY. I mean I knew that Hopkins, Sutherland and Gooding Jr. were good actors and I'd heard about the film, but I was believing it would be nothing special. I WAS wrong. It had been very long, since I had last seen a film, with a message, a meaning and a higher value than entertainment, but this one is it. Maybe it's just because I study psychology, but I really enjoyed this film. It will take away your illusions. Highly recommended.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slap in the face of today's consumeristic society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear reader,this movie is fully packed with meaning. The title gives out very little about the true nature of this remarkable work of Jon Turteltaub. Apart from the excellent acting of both the main characters (Hopkins and Cuba Gooding) and the secondary roles, the movie is based on a script of rare quality.This movie is certainly not going to be appreciated by everyone, certainly not by those unable to honestly look into the modern society and the workings of it, and their role in that society. This movie asks for soul-searching, and unless you are ready for it, unless you are ready to "give up control", you most probably won't like it.I did like it, thanks also to the fact that I already have meditated on the issues the film raises, earlier in my life. This film is capable of polarizing, because it contains a lot of unpleasant truth, that humanity should accept in order to really advance. This is an important movie, a very strong statement on today's society's relationshipt to nature and it's inhabitants. In the same time, it's analyzing the question of imprisonment and the treatment of inmates. It also raises questions about friendship and loyalty in a way never seen before.If you have not seen the movie and wonder whether you should, I will give you a hint without spoiling anything: if you didn't like Princess Mononoke, you will not like this movie, either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why isn't this film more well known?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched the network premiere of it on CBS and was blown way by how good it was. However, I'm even more shocked by the fact that I hadn't heard of it. I went to Box Office Mojo and found out that it only made 35 million dollars. I don't understand why this film was poorly received. The performances from all four lead actors were absolutely great. Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr. had great chemistry with each other and I love to see another movie with them together in lead roles. Maura Tierney consistently proves what a versatile actress she is and I'm convinced that she will become an even better actress. Donald Sutherland was his usual charming self and although is screen time was limited, he made up for it with his wonderful performance. The story of the movie is about a man, Ethan Powell (Hopkins), who is brought from Africa with charges of murder after living in the rainforest with gorillas for two years and hasn't spoken a word since his capture. Gooding Jr. plays a psychiatrist, Theo Caulder, who is assigned to him, who is determined to reach out to him and figure out what happened to him. Sutherland plays Gooding Jr.'s superior while Tierney plays Hopkins daughter. There were a lot of nicest touches in this movie such as Powell realizing that the camera, not his presence, bothered the gorillas, and Powell observing that the gorillas in the zoo were different from those in the rainforest. The scene where Powell demonstrates to Caulder that he needs to break down his illusions of freedom and control was really done well. I was impressed by the fact the reason for why Powell cracked was not only because gorilla hunters viciously killed Powell's gorilla family but also because of the items he left in the forest lead the hunters to the gorillas and, therefore, felt responsible. Overall, I thought this was a terrific movie and that everyone should go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and intelligent assessment of the human condition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On any level, this film has to be considered one of the most incisive and painful commentaries on the human condition. Above the acting (superior performances), above the direction, above all the production values is the constant message that we as a race are marching toward an open grave pit. For all our possessions, for all our wealth, for all our so-called achievements, we have yet to learn to respect the intelligence of nature and to act accordingly. "Instinct" is in every living organism and to deny one's own instinct is to go against the natural order. The prison system in this country doesn't work because it is used to destroy man's spirit instead of supporting it. Until we learn how to live in harmony and love with all the other living organisms, we will continue to destroy what we seek to build. Don't buy those Christmas presents - support your wildlife fund. We don't need things, we need spiritual reconnection with the earth we live on. Dr. Powell, as played by Anthony Hopkins, is one of the most highly evolved beings ever seen in a movie. To the writer I am grateful for his creation, to Mr. Hopkins I am grateful for giving us a character to emulate. This movie has made a lasting impression on me. I hope it does the same for everyone who sees it. Open your heart because if you don't, then you will create your own inner prison and live a messy life that the rest of us will have to clean up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very, very good film, with great script, acting, and emotional depth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend and I saw a sneak preview of INSTINCT last night. The film stars Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr. and looked like a thriller about an anthropologist who went to Africa and wound up living with gorillas instead of just studying them. It was much more.Hopkins' character, Dr. Ethan Powell, is accused of the murders of several Africans. Having been held in a Rwandan prison for a year, he's then extradited to the U.S. and put in a lovely prison in the insane department. Donald Sutherland (looking mighty fine!) is a noted professor of psychiatry at a nearby University, and Gooding is his pet resident, Dr. Theo Calder. When Sutherland's department is asked by the feds to do a psych evaluation, Gooding as Calder researches the case and begs to be allowed to do the work. Calder has been shown at this point to be a brilliant, ambitious resident with a sterling career ahead, and so Sutherland gives him the chance.What develops from there is a wonderfully written, exquisitely acted story, interweaving the sessions with Powell and Calder with the life of the prison and its insane inmates. Further woven into the fabric is the story of what happened to Powell in Africa. In the African scenes, Stan Winston's work on the apes is incredibly realistic and never cartoonish. Danny Elfman's score (I don't always like Elfman, but did enjoy the Batman score) is also a beautiful accompaniment to these scenes, though a little heavy in other parts of the film.It's hard to explain the refreshingly intelligent and moving and thoughtful script of this film. Issues such as what is really civilized behavior, the pack as family mentality, and humanity vs. inhumanity are explored with depth but never with a heavy hand. The performances of Hopkins and Gooding are exceptional. Gooding did a great job with the other film I'd seen him in, JERRY MAGUIRE, but the depths of emotion and the layered aspects of his performance in INSTINCT are incredible.My friend said after we'd left the theater last night that this came very close to being a Great Film. And she's right. It had a great script and brilliant performances by all, fully realized characters (even the secondary ones), good plot. Where it falls a little, I think, is in the direction. Jon Turteltaub is a competent director who has done films I've enjoyed, such as WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING and PHENOMENON. But in this case, with everything it had going for it, Turteltaub didn't hold the strings tight. The pacing is off in a few places, and a whiff of a subplot involving Gooding's character in a romance with Maura Tierney as Hopkins' daughter fails because you can feel it waffling. Should we leave this subplot in or pull it out? Since they couldn't decide, it leans both ways from scene to scene. This speaks to me of weakness in the director.But INSTINCT is a very, very good film. Highly recommended. And those of you who are prone to weep, bring your hankies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why isn't this movie more well known?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is a GREAT movie. It has a story line that while not complicated, is very different. And it is a great story that is very facinating. There were a number of great character acts too. There are a number of characters in the insane prison from a number of "unknown" actors that really give the movie added personality. It made me want to look up these actors to see what else they do. The scenes with the gorillas were tastefully done, with no over kill that made it look somewhat artificial, which so many movies tend to do. For example, 'Greystoke' starring Christofer Lambert as Tarzan, was an attempt at realism, but had the apes portraying some very human like relationships. Not so with 'Instinct'. The only thing I found spoilt the movie a bit was to suggest that an American insane prison setup would find it necessary, even encouraged, for inmates to be violent to each other. This ridiculous aspect brought the quality of the movie down a notch or two. The relationship between Hopkins and Gooding was fantastic. And the intense scene between them involving 'duck tape' really brought forth the message the movie was giving. SO, why is the movie more well known??? I guess the movie promoters just didn't do their job very well. OH WELL!!! Movie gets 8/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow to start, but ultimately rewarding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSSometimes it's a curiousity that just won't go away. Why is it that the vast majority of films which are mainly based in a mental institution are quality. "One Flew Overs The Cuckoo's Nest", the mental institution section of "12 Monkeys" and this film, are all movie memories to treasure.Society has always believed that if someone is mentally different to the rest of us, then that person requires to be physically confined. This might be true in the occasional case, but as John Stuart Mill once considered, what makes Society flavoured is it's variety in viewpoints. Mill pondered that rather than locking away someone with a different viewpoint to our own, we should cherish this persons opinion. In a way, this film continues along this idea.In "Instinct", Cuba Gooding Jnr, an actor who I confess to not being a big fan of, although who displayed excellent skill in the final ten minutes of this film, convinces his boss, the God like Donald Sutherland, to allow him to investigate the case of an "ape-man" (Hopkins). Cuba spends the majority of this film either talking to Sir Hopkins and learning the truth about society and freedom or talking about Anthony's situation with Hopkin's daughter, Maura Tierney. All three actors put in acceptable performances, with the occasional moment of excellence, and the plot of this film is, whilst not too obvious when watching but definate afterwards, apparently heading to a blatant climax at the end of it.The thing with this film which I love, despite the almost forced opinion of loving animals and hating humans, is the idea towards the end of freedom. Are we free beings? If you ever ask a person on the street if they consider themselves to be free, it's logical to assume that they'd say something like "of course I'm free, I have choice and the freedom to do what I want". The problem, as this film points out is that ultimately, we don't. The restraints upon us, normally by an authority figure in this society, hinder this attempt to be ultimately free and our desires to gain this authority by playing "The Game" only drag us further and further from ever being in reality free. Ultimately, aside from the cute Gorilla's and a mental institute full of scarily likeable "madmen", this notion of freedom is the most important part.If you choose this film, I suggest you watch it because your willing to think. If you desire to watch Gorilla's in their living enviroment, watch a nature programme with David Attenborough or someone similar. This film requires an open mind, and the ability to accept, that perhaps, no matter how hard we try, freedom is something the majority of us will never have.</fullReview>

The performances by Anthony Hopkins, Cuba Gooding, Donald Sutherland, and Maura Tierney (who I especially liked) is reason enough to watch this, but the plot is also a very good reason to check this one out. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Instinct (1999) is an excellent movie which illustrates the illusion of control.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILER!The movie drives home the point brilliantly that all control is an illusion and that the only control we actually have is self control; to attempt to control others in any arena is abusive.Ethan clearly states that the reason he has this knowledge is due to the fact that he had different teachers.It is a sad state of affairs when gorillas are more intelligent in re nobility and respect than are human beings. (No offense intended to gorillas, only admiration).The movie is classified as "fiction with a purpose" - it teaches simple human and animal respect and illustrates many truths about our existence as human beings in our world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a moviewatcher who yearns for really gripping and powerful storytelling, I am more often than not disappointed by what Hollywood produces. But Instinct, in my opinion, has found a place among those few movies that completely captivate me and pull me into the story itself.While Instinct has lots to offer any viewer, environmentalists and animal rights sympathizers will find particular meaning in the story. I cannot say more, for part of the fun in watching this movie is to figure out the mystery as the characters do.Finally, I feel it necessary to point out that this movie is loosely based off a book of equal quality: Ishmael, by Daniel Quinn. Go read it. Trust me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a tale of a man who is predetermined to be insane because of the murder of two people in the wilderness. And what a tale it is. The movie stars two great actors (Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr) who live up to thier stardom, once again, with some brilliant acting.The only bad notes that I have of this movie is that I found the first 30-40 minutes to be somewhat boring... but that changed, and I'll get to that in a second. The other note that I have is that Anthony Hopkins character's story because very easy to figure out early on. You knew why he killed before he ever said why. I did anyway.As the tale advanced in plot, it became very gripping. By that I mean that you just had to figure out what was going to happen. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and my ears from the words they were saying. I just had to know what was going on. There are some great jolts in the film too which is great to see in a non horror/suspence movie. I jumped a few times. You'll know what I'm talking about if you never seen it.Trust me. If you rent this one an get past the first 30 minutes... the last 90 will be a great experience. It was for me. I can't believe I waited this long to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if the purpose of a film is to stir emotions , provoke thought and ask questions then this film succeeds in all 3 areas. Ethan powell (hopkins) is an eminent anthropolgist specialising in the field of primatology. While on a field trip in Rwanda studying silverback gorillas he suddenly disappears and is feared dead, another victim of the harsh jungle habitat.When he is discovered by a group of gorilla poachers 2 years later he is not the man, quite literally, he was before....... Cuba gooding Jnr is the chosen psychologist assigned to unlock Powells silence and discover the events of the 2 missing years.Not wanting to spoil the film, to explain any more would serve only to give away the films excellent plot.I found myself profoundly moved after watching this film, it provokes some very serious issues about mans right to do with this planet what he wishes and our place in the order of species, excellent performances all round only add to what is a truly superb film which is unique in that it genuinely made me evaluate how i looked at the world in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film today, not expecting too much. This was mainly because I had heard that it is 'loosely' based on the books by Daniel Quinn which I am a great fan of. I must admit I was quite skeptical of it when I saw some of the other reviews on this site. That is why I have to write this review - because I think this film is VERY underrated. I suppose the main reason why many people did not like this film is because they didn't understand it. If you have read the books by Daniel Quinn then I feel I am justified to say you will at least enjoy this film. I waited all the way through it thinking 'Oh, something rubbish is going to happen now' but it never came. An hour and a half through the film I thought 'The ending is going to destroy it' but when the credits rolled up I had no bad feelings about it at all. Watch this film, especially if you are a fan of Ishmael. Give it a chance. Most recently I have found that the critics have been wrong (in my mind) about alot of films - that Hannibal was bad, that Traffic was good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie gives you an excellent message, and it delivers a philosophical aspect that results to be so vast, but at the same time it is given in a very simple way. This movie does an excellent job in making the viewer reflect on how life is and how it can be, it only depends on the point of view of each person that conforms society as it exists, and also on the will to be aware of our own acts and the consequences of this same acts in society. For example all the wars that has been fought during human recorded history are a waste of energy, and even some of those wars have been in the name of god, so I think that sometimes we humans should have to consider if our way of acting and thinking make us slaves of unpractical and hateful ideas or does it liberate us. If religion makes us fight against each other, then let us be free of religion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent adaptation of Quinn novella</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the umpteenth time a book has been made into a movie. But rather than dwell on the differences Instinct was not a movie based on a book: it was an application of Quinn's book to people. The result is an excellent movie, but you really need to read the book to understand much of the subtlety.Cuba Gooding, Jr plays a rough approximation of Quinn's anonymous narrator in the book, except he's not a rebel, until the end. Cuba's acting is some of the best its been. Opposite is the part of Goliath the Gorilla (read the book he's not the one in the cage) played by Anthony Hopkins, and his acting is much better than in the Mask of Zorro. Basicly what has happened is Hopkins is a primatoligist that comes to live with a docile family of Gorillas and finds what humans have been missing all this time: then the family is attacked and Hopkins kills two of the hunters. He's caught and taken to the US to stand trial. Cuba gets the job of deciphering Hopkins.More of the depth in this film is from a big combination of acting, editing and sound track which combine to make a really memorable film.Approved from the Aerodrome</fullReview>

It shows how we have lost living in a society like the one we are in and opens eyes to what kind of life we live and how much human abuse from being on a "powerful" position.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I entered the theatre having no real idea what "Instinct" was about, but it seemed like a thriller to me, something similar to "The Silence of the Lambs". However, what I expected to be just another murder mystery turned out to be the powerful story of a man who had finally learnt to live.Dr. Calder is sent to make an evaluation on Dr. Powell, an anthropologist convicted for murdering 5 men in Rwanda. However, when Dr. Powell relates his experience in the African jungle, he starts teaching Theo Calder a thing or two about "civilisation" and "humanity", thus encouraging Theo not only to learn how to live but also to challenge the rules.The scenes with the gorillas were so realistic, that I only realised later that they were created artificially. Sometimes, I felt like I was actually watching a documentary.The acting was superb. Anthony Hopkins was excellent as always and Cuba Gooding Jr. was just perfect as his student/friend. The supporting cast was solid as well, especially the prison inmates.Despite Theo and Dr. Powell's daughter's confusing relationship and the highly improbable ending, "Instinct" has some beautiful movie moments. Dr. Powell's connection with the gorillas as well as his speech to Theo at the zoo are very touching. The scene at the prison where the inmates tear apart their cards, challenging the guards' authority also reminded me of the famous "O Captain, My Captain" scene in "Dead Poets' Society".All I can say, is that "Instinct" is a rare film. One that does not need tons of action and explosions to be enjoyable but simply talks about something we can all connect too: life!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the Mr. Hopkins most powerful and moving performance yet. He takes you through his trial of pain and emotional torture, and then delivers the movie theme in a powerful and definitive discovery. When he states "Dominion" to Cuba Gooding, it brought the emotion to the surface that this is the reason most of our troubles today exists and continue to fester like an uncontrollable virus. Unfortunately, the very people in power that are in positions to do something about it, will merely choose to overlook the message. Thank you to the directors and producers that gave us this wonderful and compelling story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very thoughtful film -- a film to be experienced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>INSTINCT is also political and thought provoking. It treats its subject matter seriously.It was misleadingly publicized as in the vein of Jonathan Demme's "Silence of the Lambs" 1991 -- not at all. Its story actually revolves around Anthony Hopkins as an anthropologist who has been "accepted by the gorillas" and a young psychiatric doctor well portrayed by Cuba Gooding Jr. who gained lessons learned (and vice versa) from Hopkins' character.It is more in the realm of Michael Apted's "Gorillas in the Mist" 1988, and with probing humanity/society norm questions raised as in Terry Gilliam's "12 Monkeys" 1995 ('to be in control', 'to have freedom', 'to have dreams'...what do these words mean?)Cuba Gooding Jr. gave a tour de force performance as the young psychiatrist under the 'wings' of his boss (Donald Sutherland). His interaction with Hopkins' character is fascinating to follow. Hopkins, as always, delivered intensely. Maura Tierney performed well as the daughter to Hopkins.Yes, there are prison scenes which can be reminiscent of Frank Darabont's "Shawshank Redemption" 1994 -- prison guard brutality we were not spared.Hang in there. The beginning parts could be traumatic and jarring, but by the end of the film, you will be satisfied -- it can be a tearjerker, too.Director Jon Turteltaub ("While You Were Sleeping" 1995) has made a very thoughtful film. It is best appreciated if we would be still and listen, and be patient and trust in the progress of the story -- we will have insights gained as we observe how Doctor Theo Caulder (Gooding's character) learned from his experience with Doctor Ethan Powell (Hopkins' character).Life is full of lessons and they are there for us to appreciate as long as we're willing to open, let go and give ourselves time to rethink and refresh -- "Dare to be naive" as Buckminster Fuller said.This film also brings to mind Great Britain's psychoanalyst/psychiatrist R. D. Laing's book "Knots" 1970, its very first paragraph: "They are playing a game. They are playing at not playing a game. If I show them I see they are, I shall break the rules and they will punish me. I must play their game, of not seeing I see the game." "The Politics of Experience" 1967 is another gem of a book from Dr. Laing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece in every way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no fault to find here. While all of the performances (except Cuba Gooding, Jr., maybe) were just about perfect, Anthony Hopkins is clearly the star here. As with Jonathan Demme's unwatchable The Silence of the Lambs, Hopkins conveys in his character a presence of raw animal power just waiting to be unleashed... a chilling performance in his initial scenes (this is the only similarity to Silence). He touches on so many other emotional aspects in the rest of the film... We're looking at Oscar-nominee material. He really stands out in a film with so many good features. As for the rest of the film? Beautiful. The script is simply brilliant as it traces the past of Dr. Ethan Powell (Hopkins) through flashbacks as told to Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s Dr. Theo Calder. The music really adds to the mood. The plot and story are exceptional. This is not going to be the feel-good movie of the year, of course--when we actually see, via the final flashback, what drove Powell to commit the murders for which he was incarcerated, it is immensely touching. There were tears in my eyes from that point until the movie ended. And the ending was great, giving such a heavy, powerful drama a nice but surprisingly well-fitting feel-good touch. This is NOT a make-you-miserable movie! I HIGHLY recommend this movie--to anyone. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the movie after seeing the previews. It looked interesting - the premise being a man killing other men in defense of his newly adopted gorilla family. The question being -why do humans believe we are so special?I had no idea until the opening credits that the movie was "suggested" by the novel Ishmael by Daniel Quinn. Ishmael is a masterpiece and although the movie really has nothing to do with the story itself, the book's message is still there. Yes, there are some corny scenes,the playing cards for example, but overall, it manages to convey the truth. We have been lied to for centuries. Maybe there is a different way to live, a way where we don't rule and destroy the world. I would suggest reading "Ishmael" and Quinn's other books "The Story of B" and "My Ishmael". It is not great literature but it is great philosophy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of hundreds of movies, you can still say bluntly and definitely it is one of the top 10!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been watching movies ever since I was a child and given this fact, I am so picky about movies and not like many whose experiences don't pass ten movies and dare to watch a silly movie and say it is the best. Instinct is just one of the very very few mesmerizing movies. It really got me sitting breathless waiting for the lessons coming out from Hopkin's mouth and played on Gooding Jr's eyes just wonderfully. I mean those who know Cuba Gooding Jr's ability of getting you right where the role should (no body forgets his brilliance in Men of Honor). I guess "Instinct" giving you the chance to watch two gigantic actors (Hopkins and Gooding Jr.) and the lines in the movies are just as important.I wasn't exaggerating at all but a story that is about a professor who was willing to forget about his only daughter, forsake every thing that has to do with life's most joyous materialistic things and no ambition can drag him down anymore! Such personality must make you wonder how and why a man can leave all that! The answer is simply that nothing really exists or matters as long as humanity which was supposed to be out of the jungle and in the civilized world, was actually not there but among a bunch of gorillas!!!! Instinct is one of the slow paced movies but this is necessary when the movie has a moral. I find it strange that some people don't really find the intensity in slow paced movies such as Instinct, Deer Hunter, The Big Kahuna,etc...Though John Turteltaub doesn't have a record of great movies but his directing in this movie is just brilliant and those who are into philosophical and psychological scenes, will know what I am talking about when they get to see the movie. The duct tape scene is probably the master scene, however, the one at the end when Hopkins is facing the window making you wonder what's in his head is also a scene of no less importance, it shows great directing paying attention to many details like the light outside the window, Hopkins colleagues, the way Hopkins is standing. I guess that was just genius. I definitely give Instinct 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cuba Gooding, Jr. is magnificent in this role. This film is a drama which demonstrates the psychological elements inside a maximum security institution for the criminally insane. Or does it? While the story is quite contrived, the drama a bit anti-climactic, and the dialog sometimes choppy and poorly-delivered, the overall work is far above the current critic's estimation.Anthony Hopkins is exemplary as the angry mental patient who is enamored with gorillas (don't ask, it's actually interesting, once you get into the story), and delivers a stellar performance. While his character is not given the same love as is Hannibal Lecter, Hopkins still contributes a good portion of his talents herein.All in all, while it's not Friday night fare, there is still something here worth seeing.It rates a 7.7/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If a movie can make me think, cry, question, smile... it's successful in my mind. This movie accomplished all of the above. It is NOT a pro-environment movie, so don't ignore it out of fear of being bombarded with the Sierra Club mentality. There is but one line in the film that can be attached to that sentiment. It is more about the folly of our tendency to congratulate ourselves on reaching the pinnacle of the evolutionary chain, whereas in truth it points to us as more like the virus we are defined as in "The Matrix". It is a movie that makes me "want to be a better man". Anthony Hopkins is, as usual, inscrutable... saying more with a single look in his eyes than many actors do with a full script. Cuba Gooding plays off of him well, and independently gives an excellent portrayal of a man searching for... for what he finds. Well worth the rental fee. I got it to pass the time and now add it to my list of "would watch again".</fullReview>

While some may feel that there is a little predictability and sappiness to the script, the two individual performances are so powerful and compelling, that they are worth the price of admission alone. Hopkins never looked sharper, even in his Hanibal Lector role. You are hanging on his every word and can't wait to see where he is going to take you on this emotional and intriguing film. While Gooding does take a little longer to start projecting his emotions, he is most powerful in the closing moments of the film. The photography, the music, the staging, are all very entertaining and help to weave a consummate picture. I give it 9 1/2 stars out of ten</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very excited to see " Instinct", I have been waiting to see this movie since I first saw a preview of it. I know then, it was going to be great! Then, on Saturday night, the sneek preview rolled on in to the theater closets to me. There was no chance of me missing this movie, I was not disappointed. Anthony Hopkins plays Dr.Ethan Powell, who is accused of killing 2 and wounding 3 unwanted park rangers with a club. He is brought from a jail in Africa to the U.S. to be study. His doctor is Doctor Theo Calder, played excellently by Cube Gooding Jr. As the movie goes on it centers around the two of them and the interviews at the jail. One scene Ethan attacks Theo and is ready to break his neck when he begans to ask him questions. The one line I personally loved was when he has a piece of tape over Theo's mouth, and tells him in a voice I will never forget " Who never had control, you only thought you did!" After that, the movie justs gets better and better. Thought one good thing about this movie are Ethan's " friends" in jail, they are funny characters. This movie has great acting, even from some of the supporting characters like Donald Sutherland as Theo's mentor and Maura Tierny as Ethans daughter. Not only does this movie have great acting, but a good story as well. Go and see this movie for everything it has, which, at the end, is everything you were looking for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many miss the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of reviewers have made the pat/rushed judgment that this film is an amalgamation of "Gorillas in the Mist" and "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest." They miss the point. This is not an environmental activist story, and although it does touch on the theme of societal control, its focus is much more on the individual's perception of self within the social construct. That said, it is imperfect and suffers somewhat from a handful of melodramatic scenes (mostly with Gooding front-and center). But the intent of the film--as with the novel from which it is taken--is to instill questions within the viewer regarding the illusions we in our affluent, materialistic Western society hold regarding ourselves and our collective and individual senses of freedom, individualism, and control. As such, certain moments that some viewers proclaim improbable--such as Hopkins' exit scene--are intended to be allegorical more than realistic. This requires the viewer to rise above literalism, which many American viewers often find difficult to do, given American cinema's tendency to shy away from allegory and stick with more profit-producing formulae.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hybrid of genres ? none of which really works that well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Professor Ethan Powell is returned to America by Ugandan police ? for years he has been living wild in the mountains and was captured after killing several men. He is brought to America for trial but first must undergo a psychological evaluation. Smelling a best seller and a career boost, Theo Caulder takes the case and enters the prison. However his journey into Powell's mind is not as easy or as straightforward an experience as he had imagined.I can't remember last when I watched a film that tried to be so many things at the same time. Instinct is one of those films to me ? it does psychological drama, thriller, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Gorilla's in the Mist. The major failing of this aim is that it doesn't manage to do very well with any of these and ends up feeling like a hotchpotch of half ideas. The plot is stretched from the very start ? Powell opens up to Caulder with alarming ease (and out of nowhere) and things become increasingly half-explained from then on. The central part of the story that is meant to keep us hooked (why did Powell kill those men?) is clear from the opening 5 minutes (or even from a brief plot summary!) so that drama is all but absent.Backing this up is the subplot that sees Powell caring for and liberating the brutalised inmates in the prison in a series of scenes that seeming arise from nothing to the extent that I was left wondering where all that came from! Likewise the interview scenes lack any real tension of their own. The main (or at least I think it was) strand of Powell living among the gorillas for years is probably the most interesting but again is a little silly. He never looks like he has slept rough or had anything other than a full nutritious diet the whole time ? it certainly doesn't fit with his early description as a wild man! Having said that, the final scene in the jungle flashback is very moving and intense and is worth seeing despite the rest of the film.Anyone who thinks that the film isn't lazily written and poorly delivered will only need to see the final shot of the film to agree that clearly something's weren't thought through and that this story needed more focus and strength. With Sir Hopkins in the lead I had hoped he would bring more to the role, and, in fairness, he tries hard, but his interview scenes are a little too hammy and his `wild man' is too civilised and polite after an initial opening. Gooding Jr's character has to cover several of the genres and he struggles as a result of this. He never really convinced me in his role and is overshadowed by even a poor Hopkins. The support cast is not great -?the prisoners are nothing more than clichés who fill out the film and do nothing to add to the credibility (or lack thereof) of the plot.Overall this film has moments that work and moments that don't. It isn't that it is a bad film, it simply doesn't work together as one story. The sad fact is that the central story is not dramatic or detailed enough to fill the running time, so lots of clutter has been added which fills it out but also drags it down unnecessarily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Instinct is underrated entertainment. Gooding and Hopkins are forces to be reckoned with.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Credit IMDb) Nearly two years after having gone amiss in Africa, renowned anthropologist Dr. Ethan Powell is caught committing a crime and subsequently imprisoned in a Florida mental institution, where aspiring psychiatrist Dr. Theo Calder takes over his important case. Dr. Powell, who has been with a group of gorillas during all that time, is not talking at all and seems to be living in a dream world. Very slowly, Dr. Calder manages to reach Ethan Powell and starts finding out why Ethan killed two of the poachers. Yet Theo's case is not just about why the murders have happened, but also about how Dr. Powell became the being he is in the first place. With Ethan's silence broken, Theo is introduced into a world beyond common human comprehension: The true nature of being. He learns that mankind's control of everything is a mere illusion and that the true values of existence can't be found so easily. Ethan changes Theo's view of things forever.Instinct is a powerful film, which succeeds more often then not. I've seen critics bash this film, and IMDb reviewers themselves, and for what? It's got a strong story, a great background story regarding Hopkins, and whenever those two interacted I was on the edge of my seat. I was also really touched by some of the flashback scenes with Hopkins and the Gorilla's, it was very well done. What starts off as a power struggle between Cuba and Hopkins turns into a unique and beautiful friendship, and I loved the way it went down. This is one of Cuba's most underrated movies, and I don't get the disdain for it.Performances. Anthony Hopkins is excellent here, as usual. His intensity knows no bounds, and I always felt alert and glued to my seat whenever his presence was on my T.V screen. His chemistry with Cuba was great as well. Cuba Gooding is very effective here, giving one of his finest performances in his hey-day of success. I've always been a big fan of his, and wish his work was fine these days such as this one. Donald Sutherland is wasted in a bit role here, he was OK. Maura Tierney is good in her limited screen time.Bottom line. I don't get why people dislike this movie, it's got everything I want in a Dramatization. Hopefully you'll be like me, and see this movie for what I feel it is, a really good film. Very much recommended.8/10</fullReview>

I absolutely loved the on-screen chemistry between Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding, Jr. The script certainly helped, but their work together went well beyond the words and brought the arc of their characters' relationship to life.I'm not at all put off that I never forgot that this is a movie and not real life. This film is artifice in the service of truth. Apart from cinematic technique, this had enough of the theatrical to it to remind me of the power of performance to shake up an audience.I love that it worked on both the from-the-gut and up-in-the-head levels, which is, I think, the point Anthony Hopkins' character was trying to make: not that he'd been transformed into a gorilla but that he was a human being who had come to be accepted as a human being in gorilla society and became more authentically human because of it. The polemic is not anti-human. The polemic is anti- humans fooling themselves into thinking that the trappings of modern "civilization" are essential to one's identity as a human, and that being human is tantamount to being an overlord to other beings.BTW, isn't this the movie where they said the tagline should have been "Show me the monkey"?</fullReview>

We need to have more films like this and "Gorillas in the Midst." It has been long coming to see Hollywood actually using the film industry to promote how the killing of such precious animal life is immoral and performed without conscience. It was once said that Africa is the only country left with a true soul; well, I believe that. What an extraordinary picture. Great effort on everyone's part. I do wish people would not keep type casting Anthony as "Hannibal the cannibal" though. He is a note-worthy actor who has endured many critics along the way; especially in the UK.

		<shortDescription>A Profound Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this film has been widely criticized for minor continuity errors, unremarkable cinematography and allegedly trumpeting the environmentalist and animal rights agendas, the film has a profound message that breaches the confines of these criticisms. What makes this film so powerful is the chemistry between Hopkins and Gooding combined with fascinating character development and brilliantly orchestrated screen writing. Unfortunately, the magic of this film may be lost upon viewers with a short attention span. While obviously sympathetic to animal rights and environmentalist concerns the dialog in this film merely frames the overall picture painted by the brilliant use of our very own behavioral archetypes which are represented by the characters and the environment itself.Dr. Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.) represents our own individual struggle to live in harmony with our environment. The maximum security prison can be seen to represent the mind of Caulder himself. His initial mentor, Dr. Ben Hillard (Donald Sutherland) is symbolic of everything Caulder aspires to become within the confines of his limited understanding of the world we truly live in. During his sessions with convicted murderer Dr. Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins), Caulder is introduced to a world beyond that which he has come to understand when he is introduced to the primal concepts of existence used by our ancestors through Powell and also to the concept that human beings and all their achievements are dwarfed by the marvel of nature itself, and in this sense Powell becomes a new mentor for the yet young and impressionable Caulder. Dr. Powell's escape from prison at the end of the film is concurrent with Caulder's escape from the confines of his formerly rigid way of thinking about the world. The core message of the film is not just freedom but also the struggle we each face to live in harmony with our environment and each other due to that very same freedom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is excellent movie because it shows who we really are. Also, it make us think about our nature, life and purpose of living. It reminds us that we are not only ones who live on the Earth, so we have no right to destroy this planet, especially not to torture and slaughter other species and living beings. As they said in the movie, people do not have right to rule a planet, we are not kings or Gods! It would be great if there are more people who share this opinion. I wish other human beings, who are not contaminated with modern and amoral life standards, to see who they are and change their habits and life style.If not, we could destroy ourselves, and i think that is something what nobody wants!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a movie with control issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who believe this is a movie is about mental illness...you are mistaken. This film is about insanity of a sort...the insanity of control. The questions of reality, control, and normalcy drive this movie, but in the end, it is about who controls one's heart and mind. Society is a framework in which most humans live. That structure shapes the way we view reality and it more often than not, obscures it. We live thinking we control our own destinies. We believe that our choices, if all good, will keep us safe and secure. This film challenges those assumptions of control. The way it opens these issues for examination is clever and thought provoking. It can even change the way one sees the world. This film is well worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Impact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love monkey's, Gorillas, Chimps all primate type, so that's the first thing I really enjoyed about this film. Also this film made a powerful impact while I watched it. During certain scenes in this film it showed the true reality of each individual. We are all animals inside just wanting to love and protect, be loved and be protected. There were certain scenes that were unbelievably powerful, to the point you forgot you were watching a film and felt the emotions of the characters. Hopkins and Gooding did a phenomenal job for their characters. Hopkins character wasn't a deranged wild man, but a man of truth. He learned something from another species and took that with him. Gooding's character was the everyday man, pleasing people to improve his job, but what he learned was far more valuable than anything he received before, and he learned it from a man that learned it from a Gorilla. In all truths each person that watches this film could learn something about themselves or about those around them. This film is amazing and very powerful, I recommend this film to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Person's Family is Worth Defending Despite the Repercussions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw all the flaws in this film (Gorrilla's in the Mist meets The Shawshank Redemption, etc.) yet walked away still thinking about the writers' timely and meaningful theme.Hopkins and Gooding are entirely themselves here, but in the best ways both actors can be. Hopkins is deep, ultra-masculine and irrevocably wounded, Gooding is strong, smart and full of compassion for the "underdog". Good roles for both.Personally, the point at which tears welled up in my eyes was when the director finally presented some footage of the noble, gentle gorillas at the heart of the story. These close-up shots are beautiful. The horror that befalls them is tragic. Not exactly Shakespearean drama, perhaps, but a strong polemic for our times, nonetheless. Worthy praise is due to the brave folks who made and released this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better Than a Rating of 6</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised to see this movie was ranked so low on the IMDb. I know this is not a great film but it certainly wasn't a bad one. For the most part it's gotten mixed reviews- some loved it, others hated it. I myself thought the film was very good- the story was a good one, the acting was great especially by Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr. As someone noted the film is very similar to One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest which is one of the greatest films ever made. Both incorporate the same ideas and have similar characters. Both center around a main character who is seen as crazy but really isn't and is abused by an institution that doesn't understand him and what he believes in. If you like movies with strong meanings and good acting I would highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

Is the human being alone on the earth ? What about the other animates ? We can destroy them and may be take their freedom but actually are we free ? Thinking and thinking on our life is the goal of the movie. I can say that its really successful on this goal. Anthony Hopkins acts excellent as usual and we see that Cuba Gooding Jr. goes great with him. He s the surprise of the movie with his huge performance. I think you can be bored if you are waiting a thriller but this is a big drama especially human's drama. I wont forget its dialogs. You know "That , game..". You must see it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched it the first time and I cried... Then I did it again and I couldn't stop a few tears! And my tears were not only for the poor animal being shot, but for the poor human beings that do not deserve this title! Anthony Hopkins did a great job, as always, giving birth to a character that taught me to value the life and commitment and to pity those who cannot understand the true and basic values of our lives. The story itself might have been a bit too exaggerated, but it kept us all there, in the wood and/or in the jail, feeling the same with the characters and wishing for the best to happen... So, did I rate it with a 10? Because I love the way Anthony Hopkins is acting; because of the quality of the image and sound; because of the story; and, of course, because of the lesson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just finished watching this movie, and it was excellent. I was discussing a few days ago that I can't remember too many movies in the past 10 years that I found thought provoking and that stayed with me when the film ended. This one did. Of course, with Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr., the acting was bound to be right on and it was. I don't remember hearing anything about this when it was in the theaters, a friend dropped by with the tape, so we watched it (actually she was the one involved in the earlier referenced conversation). It is over 2 hours long, but it goes by quickly. I also liked Meet Joe Black, and other Hopkins films, so it is not surprising that I like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I agree that some scenes, especially towards the end, feel a bit contrived and tacked on, I must say I really enjoyed this film. Anthony Hopkins, one of my favorite actors, absolutely convinced me he lived the life he says he did. Cuba Gooding Jr. is also very good as the earnest psychiatrist trying to help Hopkins. Donald Sutherland is perfect for his role. It's just too bad that all he seems to be given these days is the 'mentor role.' Although sometimes they are laid on too thick, I appreciated the messages and themes in Instinct. Definitely worthwhile viewing, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly lacking story but performances make up for it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not one of Hopkins' better-known roles, Instinct is the story of a psychiatrist called Caulder, played by Cuba Gooding Jr, trying to unravel the mystery of what happened to Dr Powell (Hopkins) when he went missing in an African jungle for 2 years and was found and charged with murders.Locked in a prison, Powell doesn't speak, uses violence erratically, and is generally regarded as a no hope. But given the chance to 'take him on', Caulder, an up and coming psychiatrist, attempts to enter the mind of him and figure out what happened to him.The story is a little bit lacking here, and plods in places, due to slightly shallow direction. But all performances more than make up for it, and allow emotional connection with the characters, particularly Caulder. Amazingly, Gooding outshines an nonetheless excellent Hopkins simply because he portrays the same quality Edward Norton is so effective at - tough, yet vulnerable. Donald Sutherland has a smallish role as his mentor, and exudes class as he has countless times before.Overall it's a half decent story, which is a little bit shallow, but is counter-balanced by the performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me put it this way. Only two movies have ever made me cry; one of them was Edward Scissorhands from when Vincent Price dies (it reminded me of mortality and Vincent Price is really dead, it's just really sad), and the other was this. The overall theme is about giving up your freedom for your family. I thought it was going to be a rip-off of Silence of the Lambs with a gorilla twist, but it wasn't. Anthony Hopkins as always does a superb acting job, but the film might have done better if he hadn't been on board and it hadn't gotten the Hannibal Lecter feeling. It was a usual movie, and if you can't see the ending coming by the first time he takes Cuba into the jungle, you probably haven't seen many movies at all. It was plain, but the way it was done and the little things like giving in to the rain make it very worthwhile. I would rather watch this than most Hollywood usual crap-on-a-stick movies like "The Ring", "Pearl Harbor", "Maid in Manhattan", etc. Watch it if you would like to refresh your views of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about a scientist who lived among the gorillas in Rwanda.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film good to see with various ethic thoughts. Hopkins (Ethan Powell, a former anthropologist) again played the role of a violent psychopat jailed in a mental institution in Florida. The Doctor Calder (Cuba Gooding Jr) takes care of Powell and succeeded to interview him without violence. The convict gave unusual information about his previous life among gorillas. His life in the Rwandan reserves was fine until poachers came to kill gorillas and Powell tried to defend the animals, Powell was arrested, considered sick and put in jail. The film showed the injustice practised against the anthropologist and the wildlife in Africa. Perhaps those guards watching the convicts in jail were more irrational and mad than the same convicts. </fullReview>

I have seen several movies lately that ended to abruptly. As far as other movies Hopkins has been in he was right on course. I still saw the thought patterns of "Hannibal Lectur" in the eyes of Hopkins throughout this flick. Those who like Anthony will like this movie.

		<fullReview>Dan Marcus and jasper, I just have a few things to get off my chest.Last night I watched "Gorillas in the Mist" for the first time in 12 years. It is a good movie, but comparing it to "Instinct" is a pretty difficult thing to do. It is only similar to Instinct in that it has gorillas in it, and it has a message of freedom. Similar things can be said about comparing "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" to "Instinct". Mist is about Gorillas, and Cuckoo is about mental patients, while "Instinct" is mostly about the mental freedom that humans need to achieve; we need to wake up and realize that we do not own the universe.That is the message in "Instinct" that you seemed to have either so ineptly failed to comprehend, or became so very angry at, because you did understand. Yes, these other two films could point you in the same direction, but "Instinct" very bravely shoves this message right in our faces, tempting many brain-dead and/or heartless people to get their butt hairs all up in twist, bashing this incredibly brilliant, poignant and valorous film. I understand. Really I do. But you don't. Are you free, juha?Jeremy Barger</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is great! Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jnr give a fine performance in a film that portrays freedom and control as it really is-an illusion! (minor spoiler) Cuba Gooding Jnr plays Dr. Theo Calder, a man who wants to further his career by evaluating Dr Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins), a murderer who has been in the African wilderness for two years. Calder wants to learn about Powell's experience and the circumstances revolving around his so-called crime. What Calder discovers changes his way of thinking as he explores Powell's mind! Powerful, thought-provoking and even suspenseful at times, 'Instinct' is also very heart-warming and delivers an excellent story based on Daniel Quinn's book Ishmael (which I've never read)!The supporting cast are also very good, including Donald Sutherland, Maura Tierney, George Dzundza, John Ashton and Rex Linn, but it is the two leads, Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jnr., that hold 'Instinct' together. Although a bit melodramatic at times, 'Instinct' still proves to be quite touching and even sad. It makes it's point quite well through a solid script and some excellent direction from Jon Turteltaub. The soundtrack was also very good and it suited the mood of the film. **** out of *****!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, read my comment on it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always said Cuba Gooding, Jr. is a great actor. I think I first saw him in Outbreak, where he was playing the role of Major Salt, and in that moment I knew he had a lot of skills, and he would make some good movies. Not many people saw A Murder Of Crows, but I did, and I really enjoyed it. He's the main character in that one. We all saw Jerry McGuire, and we all know how great his performance was, and he got the best recognition an actor can get for it.Anthony Hopkins, yet another excellent actor. After movies like The Silence Of The Lambs and a bunch of other great movies, we should expect something good if this man is acting. And with Cuba, I think one hell of a combination.Instinct is the kind of movie that even when it's not totally realistic (A man living with gorillas for 2 years?), it has messages that are absolutely right. For example, it says that we are not Free, or we do not have Control, and that we are the Takers.If we all think about it, we'll found out it's true. Hopkins found in the gorillas a group of things that he couldn't find in humans. The gorillas helped and defended each other. And they had a lot of peace in their territory. And when Hopkins was accepted in the gorilla group, and he started to live with them, even at nights, he was living better than in his old life.This movie also makes you angry, because the scene where those black men kill all the gorillas, and Hopkins kills some people, it's very sad and not fare. Also some of the guards are so mean, that it makes you want to kill them.I think the makers of the movie exaggerated a little bit about Hopkins behavior. He was acting like a gorilla, thinking like one, and attacking people like one. But after he talks to Gooding, Jr., we see that he can actually behave like a normal person.The scene where Hopkins tapes Gooding, Jr.'s mouth and forces him to answer his question ("What have I taken from you?" "What have you lost?") it's great, and the answer is even greater. My control? No, you never had control. My freedom? No, you think you are free? My illusions? Yes, your illusions.The movie's ending is great and happy, which makes people like it even more. Hopkins escapes from prison (He wasn't really sick after all) and returns to the place he described first when talking to Cuba.I'll rate this movie with an 8 out of 10. I'd recommend it to anyone and it's really watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thankful surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ethan Powell is a famous explorer who disappeared mysteriously into the mountains of Africa, when he was on a mission set to study the wild gorillas. After many years, Powell is found by forest guards living among the gorillas. He is brought to civilization, and a young psychologist will try to discover the reasons that made Powell abandon his family and friends in order to live closer to the nature and the animals. This intriguing film has as its main qualities the Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding, Jr's brilliant and memorable performances, the interesting story and the soft and affectionate way in which director Jon Turteltaub develops the friendship between Powell and the psychologist. Instinct was a box office failure, perhaps because the audiences of nowadays just want to see action and deaths on the screens, but if you give a chance to Instinct you will have a thankful surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No I know why I liked Gorilla's in the mist so much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well what can I say, I watched this movie yesterday on video. Someone told me it was quite a good movie. Well that certain person was so right.To start with the upcoming star Cuba gooding Jr. Well he puts down a splendid job. Not only as Cuba but also the character in the movie has such a great script. Very much willing to learn and to achieve the best (not only the evaluation but eventally trying to get him out of the hell-hole). Which brings me to the "Bad" guy, Ethan Powell (Hopkins). They couldn't have casted a better one. Exactly the right amount of cynicism, humour and toughness, one would need to play this part. Altogether it was a good piece of work. Pretty much always exciting (what will Ethan do next and how will "Juha" react on it. And at the end, they both seemed to have helped each other. The only thing that bothers me a bit are the Gorilla scenes. Sometimes they are a bit too much. Too obvious that they are puppets. And the shaking hands from Powell with the female gorilla, well think about it. They should have watched Gorilla's in the mist a bit better. But altogether not a bad movie at all. It has it all (Nature, humour (the psychotic inmates), thrilling, and psychologic).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Instinct is one of those movies that finds its way into a category of movies that is undefined. I have never been one to change my list of favorite movies, which includes another "undefined" movie, Primal Fear, but without a doubt adding this movie was easy. I did not expect to be shaken by this "psychological" thriller, but in retrospect I can't imagine I would have been as impressed if I knew what I was in for.So you are wondering, if you loved it more in obscurity, why would I attempt to let you in on the secrets... I'm not! I am warning, anyone who wants to see this movie, against reading any of the "wanna be" critics words. This is a movie you need to form your own opinion on. DO NOT BE A SHEEP!To tell you anything other than... "be prepared for a journey that you wouldn't expect from this ensemble cast, (Anthony Hopkins, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Maura Tierney) and crew that adapted an original piece of literary genius, into a tumultuous and calming movie," would be saying too much.In the words of the movie: "Can you follow me?"

		<fullReview>Overall I would have to say that this is a very emotional and gripping movie with a story that kept me interested until the end. Anthony Hopkins plays the feral Ethan Powell with an intensity only matched by his co-star Cuba Gooding Jr. with his role as Powell's psychiatrist. The one thing the disappointed me greatly was the supporting cast. The patients in the psychiatric ward add a great deal to the depth of the film, but the rest of the cast play very hollow roles and did so with very little enthusiasm. I really enjoyed this movie but it fell short of it's full potential. This could have been an Oscar winning movie if more time had been spent fixing little problems here and there. As a whole this film is great, but the little nuances ate the edge off of it's exterior. I give it 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read most of the reviews posted here, and I will say this: they're all right, in one way or another. Let me say that INSTINCT is, deep down, a good film with very unfortunate things happening to it. We have an important character who is not essentially "good," and that's something that's intrinsic in a credible film - the audience's doubt of their own morality. We have a very timely story with one of the deepest points in years. We have excellent, excellent actors. However, we also have an inept director, a bizarre romantic subplot, a lousy script, and what looks to be a strugglingly happy ending to please the tv generation. All of which is a real shame, because INSTINCT, deep down, wants so desperately to change the audience dramatically, to make the people question their own beliefs, their own world, as soon as they step out of the theater. INSTINCT is really an art film that got into the wrong hands. Personally, INSTINCT, be it a mediocre film or not, changed my life. I was, deep down, concerned about certain things, but I never really brought them to the surface. Since watching the film, I've stopped eating certain foods, stopped caring about most of my possessions, and started getting my real priorities in order. What does this say? It says that for the people who go to the movies to be entertained, this movie might or might not please. For the art film lover, it's the same. Like I say, this film breaks no ground filmistically, but what I see is a story with a lot of potential and a true message that got diluted by studios, a lousy director, and the precedent of both Hopkins' career and the many "the insane are saner than the sane" films that came before it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happens if we all lose control?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amazingly well-treated script, with astounding photography and, need I say more, a brilliant performance by Anthony Hopkins.Not only are we taken into the violent environment of maximum-security facilities, or taken deep into nature, but also we are given the chance to really ask ourselves what we are.There are a couple of scenes however that play with the moviegoer's memory. For example, the way Ethan (Hopkins) is designed, reminds us of Connery's character from "The Rock". When we are taken to the gorillas territory, we tend to remember both "Congo" (for which Stan Winston designed the gorillas, as well as for this one) and "Gorillas in the Midst". Or when we see the jail environment, we cannot forget Hannibal Lecter.Still, it does have great acting, a nice music score and a highly interesting script.Definitely a "must-see" film.</fullReview>

The movie looks good, the actors do what they can with the sometimes unconvincing script and the moralistic views about the real meaning of the word 'civilization' are held back just in time before they become an insult to your intelligence.When you go see it, just enjoy it, don't think about it too much and have a nice beer afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Instinct - ***As "Instinct" was created by the writer/director team of Gerald DiPego and John Turtletaub respectively, who brought us that cinematic equivalent of nuclear waste known as "Phenomenon," I would say that "Instinct" marks a considerable advance.For the most part, the creative talents are strong. Sir Anthony Hopkins, potentially laughable as a primatologist gone native, somehow manages to pull it off. He is capable of conveying both intelligence and wisdom, as well as a feral madness. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is less successful as Dr. Theo Caulder. He delivers a restrained performance for much of the film, but during the last reel commits the "Jerry McGuire" sin of going over the top, seriously damaging the movie's finale. The score is spare, but powerful. And Turtletaub's direction is, for the most part, focused and unobtrusive. Unfortunately, he makes the embarrassing decision to pilfer a key shot from "The Shawshank Redemption." Note to filmmakers: If you're going to steal an image from another movie, don't steal the signature shot of a superior work. It only invites unfair comparisons from the audience.The story of "Instinct" is a remarkably simple one. And as the majority of scenes are dialogue exchanges which occur in a prison cell, the movie flirts with redundancy. Yet it works. And the reason it works is the secondary story. Not Dr. Ethan Powell and his experiences with the apes (although these scenes work well,) but Dr. Theo Caulder and what he learns from Powell. In this regard, the film's best scene is the one in which Powell steals Caulder's illusions. Granted, sometimes the movie is ham handed in its sermonizing (as when Powell paints his jail cell with a map of the world and gives Theo a history lesson,) but it still delivers the required emotional impact. The overall message is simple, but powerful all the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a good film.A professor lost in Africa, was found living with apes and afterthat was jailed being accused of the murder of 3 people. After atime spent in the prison of an african country. He's sent backto the U.S. There a doctor tries to investigate the reasonsbehind the murders and the wild violence that shows theprofessor from time to time, trying to overcome his silence.(Obviously the young doctor looks for an advance in histo-be-established career).What we learn through the film is a questioning about what themeaning of humanity and civilization are. Well discover thereasons that drove the professor to his now apparently violentconduct and just know that our concepts or "illusions" as arestated in the film, are just simply that: "illusions".The actors do it well, but some times the pace of the story isvery tedious, but the final result is a well rounded story,giving us at the final, the change of mind and objectives in thelife of many of the characters.I highly recommend this movie, because I think everybody needsto make -and why not, answer- yourself the question about themeaning of civilization.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here´s a movie i really liked seeing... "Instinct" is about the freedom that mankind lost and is losing every day, about how mind-numbing is civilization nowadays, about how that freedom can be regained if we LEARN how to live. The screenplay is really great, Hopkins performance completely knocked me out, the director (Turteltaub) was much better than in "While you were sleeping" or "Phenomenon". This movie is a lesson of living to anyone who sees it; maybe because of that, it sometimes becomes TOO touching, almost artificial. Anyway, a great movie; i advise anyone to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the life of me, I can't figure out what this film was supposed to be about. Animal Rights? Human rights? Psychology? Love? Prison reform?I'm a person that tends to get a little fed up with Hollywood's penchant for political activism in films. It seems anymore that every Hollywood film has some leftist political bent that it forces upon audiences. This movie continually hounds us with "Animals are people too" themes and scorns zoos, prisons, and hunters.And on top of that, the film itself wasn't very good. Hopkins seems to be trying to rekindle the aura of his famous Hannibal Lecter character with quick mood swings and spooky mind-digging discourses in prison settings. But it just doesn't work. And a maybe/maybe-not love affair between Gooding and Maura Tierney's character just teases and fizzles.The one bright spot was Gooding. He once again displays why he is one of Hollywood's most promising young talents.Save your time and miss this film.</fullReview>

But then I figured out that actually the emotional vacuum of this pushiness is the movie's theme. So, sorry for criticizing.The movie is entertaining, has its moments of deepness and very hard tries to work out man's nature.But it is not 100% convincing, and the characters just leave you untouched. I would have liked to see more of the protagonist's life and way of thinking in order to understand the personality. Ok, and the ending is very movie-like.So all in all I would say --7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great drama/psychological look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, this movie was criminally mismarketed. Whoever did the commercials should be taken out and shot to death in the street. The commercials are the worst kind. When I saw the commercials, I thought, what a horrible movie. This looks completely awful. I saw it because i was getting extremely mixed reviews, and ended up loving it. It is one of the best character studies ever. Although it rips off many movies, the reason it is so great is that it only copies one of them, and that only for a few minutes (Gorillas in the Mist.)That was the only flaw but it was needed. I, however, took a point off for it. The pacing was excellent. How many people can say that their thinking does not have awkward pacing?? That is what the movie was trying to get. And it ranked scenarios in importance to Cuba's character.This movie is much like Silence of the Lambs because it deals with a mute psychopathic murderer. However, it goes more in depth with that person and delves into his mind. Silence focused more on the relationship between Clarisse and Hannibal. It also delves deep into the mindset of humans and human nature. It deals with the mindset of someone intelligent, and, what we consider, sane. It actually has something important to say, and did not turn out to be a psychobabble thriller that is trite and common. This movie is one of the best dramas of the year, so far. See this if you want something psychological. If you can't think for yourself...see "Big Daddy."--------9</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailers have this film come across as a psychological thriller in the vein of The Silence of the Lambs, with a dash of Gorillas in the Mist thrown in for good measure. This isn't the case, so if you're expecting something along those lines, prepare to witness the contrary.Before I get into why I liked it, I must acknowledge that it's obvious that most critics have been ripping this one to shreds. Some of their arguments do hold some water; for instance, the plot is rather contrived, the characters and dialogue can be cliché, and Turteltaub's direction is generally subpar. Even the acting isn't up to the standard most people expect from the likes of Hopkins and Gooding. This is all true. However, this movie isn't about thrills and Lecter-esque psycho-gymnastics. It's more of a philosophical and intellectual commentary on civilization and humanity.Ok, so that sounds incredibly melodramatic. And often the film is just that. However, once you get beyond the surface and realize that this isn't a typical movie, you can appreciate its message. It largely condemns humanity's selfish nature, as well as civilization's tendency to work like a game, telling us what is right and wrong and using illusions of control and power to perpetuate this game. However, it also recognizes that we are capable of love, compassion, and peace; especially when we see through the illusions. The film's ability to communicate this message is what saves itself from the oft-cheesy storyline and characters. It's average fare in the "concrete" sense (i.e. the story itself, the dialogue, etc.), but it's great brain food (which I like).If you want a movie that makes you think, go see this. But, if your idea of a good movie is a 2-hour brain fart, this won't be your cup of tea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formulaic but worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Instinct last night. Basically I went for the acting, which I'd heard was great, but from critics' reactions I was expecting an essentially bad movie. I was surprised. The movie WAS formulaic and overly sentimental: a true and unabashed Hollywood studio movie, in other words. However, the acting and occasional brilliance of the dialogue came very close to making up for this. Anthony Hopkins gives a wonderful performance (when has he not?) as Ethan Powell; his brutality is at times very frightening. Check out his last brutal scene with Cuba Gooding Jr.--it's worth seeing a couple times. I found the gorilla scenes overly sentimental, but beautiful to watch, visually. Cuba Gooding, Jr. also turns in a good performance, as does Donald Sutherland. In essence, yes, you could wait to see this movie on video. The acting is great and the movie does provoke some themes that are worth thinking about--and yes, I did notice some rip-offs from other movies, but 'Instinct' eventually manages to stand on its own.</fullReview>

If you have ever met a scientist who is intensely passionate about their field of interest, you will have no problem understanding a scientist who becomes "family" to a group of mountain gorillas. Anthony Hopkins' performance is his usual high standard, and makes this movie a great movie. He could easily have been Sigorney Weaver's father in "Gorillas in the Mist".

		<fullReview>I was told before seeing this movie that it was boring. However, I found the film to be exactly the opposite. I thought it was well done and held my interest fine.Anthony Hopkins does a fabulous job (as always) as a Doctor whom fled from civilization to the African jungles, and lived with a family of apes. Actor Cuba Gooding Jr's character is there to learn from the former Doctor's experiences. He ends up learning much more than expected, he learns about life.Although I thought some parts of the film were a bit under-developed, I still think it was a success. At the start of the film, Hopkins acts just like an animal, his only connection to humans being his family which he happens to spot in a wild rage. The transition from animal to an incredibly intelligent human seemed too abrupt. Maybe if the things including the other inmates were left out, Hopkins and Gooding's relationship could have been better developed. Although, I did enjoy the interactions with the other "psychotics."Over all, I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a 'smart' movie. Don't expect too much action. You saw most of it in the teasers.</fullReview>

But I can't say the same about Cuba Gooding Jr. Honestly, I think that his character was a carbon copy of the one he played in "As good as it gets" : same tone of voice, same looks, same moves! This was rather disappointing. The plot was well-developed, although I didn't find anything original in it. Same old idea of living in perfect harmony with Mother Nature. Come on, this movie doesn't really contribute anything to a good old couch-philosophy. Alongside with some corny lines (humans are "takers", etc.) and a badly done ending, this movie does have its share of good moments, and keeps you in suspense until the very end. In short, it's a situation when not too strong a plot is being balanced by great acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sharing our feelings or just being an "observer".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Instinct" is not about gorillas or psychotic inmates, but about the feelings we have toward each other and our willingness to share or just be an observer of life. If we just observe, as an anthropologist does in the wild, we miss out on a lot of what life has to offer. If we risk by immersing ourselves in the lives of our loved ones, or a family of gorillas, we realize how precious life can be. This is just one level of many in the splendid film and performances of "Instinct".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would just like to pass on the word that this was a really great movie, with a lot of symbolism.........tied together, with fear, control, and violence....it's about a man who found living with gorillas, fascinating, they were his family, he was faced with intruders, and did what he had to protect them, though he blames himself and thinks he did a pretty poor job. The movie takes place after all this has happen, he is now finds himself facing his consequences, for his actions.....Which is where a psychologist steps in and tries to make him remember.....This movie is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly well done film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the previews I figured it'd just be another Silence of the Lambs wanna be with the only thing really going for it would be Anthony Hopkins. It turned out I was completely wrong and seeing it late night barely staying awake, once it started I was wide awake.Anthony Hopkins one again plays a psychopath, at least that's what he's appeared to be. Cuba Gooding Jr. takes on a rather different role than he's used to, as a shrink, but there are a few moments where his Jerry Maguire performance kicks in. As Cuba studies Hopkins as his patient questions begin to become answered and we are brought into Hopkins world before he was a murderer and see what drove him mad. The story works since when their sessions aren't being held we see the brutal life of living in a psychotic prison with some intense scenes involving cops and other prisoners.The story goes along well and keeps your attention throughout the entire thing. The acting of course is wonderful, Anthony Hopkins hardly ever turns in a dull role. This may not be better than his Hannibal Lector but it's just as intriguing. Cuba also does a good job and not many could keep up with Hopkins on screen at the same time. The flashbacks of the jungle and the gorillas is amazing and brings a lot of emotion to everything that goes on.There is only one problem with the film, and it's a pretty big one. It takes many scenes and aspects from other films a little to far. Dances With Wolves, The Silence of the Lambs, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, Twelve Monkeys, Gorillas in the Mist, the list can go on and on. If Instinct was released back in 1990 it would be considered a classic by now but since there have been so many films that have similar subjects and scenes that happen the same way in Instinct it's hard to look over. But Instinct is definitely worth a look at and it will capture your attention throughout.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>important and moving message despite forgivable cliches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, so the film is a mixture of One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest and Gorillas in the Mist. How many films are completely cliche free--the human race is one big cliche. I excused the cliches because I thought the movie still had touching moments and good performances. Gorillas in Rwanda were slaughtered along with over a million Rwandans in 1994. It was not the gorillas with the guns and knives. The gorillas are the closest species to the human race and it seems to so-called civilized species is the one needing to be tamed. Sometimes we need to see a simple yet important example set, even if it is cliched. Dian Fosse lost her life for the animals and Jane Goodall is trying to save them. Might be nice if some of the people rushing out to see the latest kill 'em all film would take a break and check this out. It holds a mirror up to our faces that perhaps we don't want to look into. There was nothing in here resembling one of my favorite films Silence of the Lambs (an equally good book with a conscience-not like the amazing Kesey's Cuckoo's Nest with the perspective of the Indian robbed from audiences for Jack,;a great actor in a mediocre, overhyped film version of a brilliant novel;Nicholson). Check the movie out and then check out a new horribly stunning but tragic book "We Wish To Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed With Our Families" by Phillip Gourevetch about the Rwandan genocide of 1994. (The last part of the title might be slightly different and I believe the author's last name is very close but might not be exact. Anyway it should be easy to find. I recommend it to be people who believe humans are the most intelligent species--it'll make you wonder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One powerful film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate to see the premiere of this outstanding work of art. The writing, cinemaphotography and acting were the best I've seen since Titanic. A differnt type of film and yet I classify it amongst the the best. Anthony Hopkins is Ethan Powell who has been found living in the African forests with primates. He is an anthrpologist and archeologist who loses himself to his passion and simplicity.I don't want to ruin the story so I'll be brief. Cuba Gooding Jr. wants to get ahead in his career and he sees Powell, a psych patient, as an opporunity of getting ahead. I have watched these two preform in many films and I feel this is their masterpiece. I predict an award nomination for "Instinct". The story is based on a book named "Ishmal". The characters are real, the emotion is real. This is a profound film and I recommend you empty your mind before sitting in the theater to see it. It will take you to the beginng of life and make you think of the end. People can look to this film as a reminder of our ecology and life, animal, human alike. The cast includes film veteran, Donald Suthurland. The psych patients in this fim were many unknowns, however they were talents to say the least.If you see any movie this summer, this is the one to see.I recommend children under 12 stay home, due to subject matter. Just my opinion. I'm glad had the honor to see this film and I will again soon! Raven</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I almost stayed away from the opening night of this film after having read two horrible reviews from cnn.com and abcnews.com. They claim that this movie is the reason Sir Anthony Hopkins is considering retirement.I believe very strongly in the notion this film puts forth. My belief, however, comes with the knowledge that most people will not delve any deeper into the movie. They will see it for its two leading men, some laughable lines and a few tear-inducing scenes. That is obviously not the intention of the director, writers, or cast.This movie *does* take a bit from 'Gorillas in the Mist,' but how could it not? It *is* about a brilliant man who goes to Rwanda to study primates. He *is* taken 'into' the group of gorillas, just as Diane was. But that is where the similarities end. Ethan's distinction is that he was 'a human that was allowed into a group of gorillas.' He never became an animal himself.This movie stands fully on its own two feet, while crediting the book 'Ishmael' as having put forth the suggestions contained within the film.It is well worth the money and time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating premise spoiled by cop-out ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Instinct" is based on the fascinating premise of a distinguished scholar (Hopkins) who joins a gorilla family and completely identifies with them to the extent of killing humans who start shooting the apes. Cuba Gooding gives an excellent performance as the psychiatrist who tries to connect with the now mute Professor during his incarceration in the appalling insane unit in one of the vilest prisons in the US. Sadly, the film is weakened by countless cop-outs and omissions:1) The lack of any explanation of how the professor was so devoted to the apes while being totally estranged from his wife and daughter2) The complete absence of his wife from the film after a few seconds in an early scene at the airport3) The hot-cold semi-romantic relationship between Cuba and the daughter (couldn't have anything to do with the fact that he's black and she's white and studio qualms about audience reaction?)4) The lack of any explanation for the professor's first refusing to speak a word to defend himself and later opening up to a total stranger.5) The inevitable but still depressing caricatures of brutal prison officers and careerist officials. Equally predictably, the Ugandan park rangers are glimpsed briefly only as anonymous killers before Hopkins kills them - we are not allowed to know them even as caricatures.It is all the more disappointing when you remember the excellent performances of the leads and some occasional hints at complexity of character and motivation. Examples include:1) Cuba's temptations to regard this as a superb career launching/book writing opportunity.2) The fat lazy slob of a prison doctor (who suddenly becomes clean shaven and well dressed!)offers a touching insight into what it means to try to do your best to help extremely unappealing clients in very grim surroundings.3) The dialogue between Cuba and Hopkins on who is truly free.Also Philippe Rousellot's cinematography is as magnificent as ever. Like most of the technical contributions, it deserved a far better script as a foundation for a potentially enthralling exploration of humanity and nature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ads for this movie make it look like another "Silence of the Lambs"--"enter the mind of a killer....." Those expecting a thriller along the lines of Jonathan Demme's hit will be disappointed. While this movie contains some unusually involving segments (most involving the gorillas), it mimics too many other movies to be recommended. If the director would have created an original piece (the plot had great potential), instead of borrowing scenes from "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Shawshank Redemption," "Silence of the Lambs," and not to mention "Gorillas in the Mist," he would have had something. The performances are fine, but I thought Cuba Gooding Jr. was a little miscast as Hopkins' doctor (a little too young for the part, in my opinion). But very restrained, compared to his parts in Jerry Maguire and As Good as it Gets. The final product gets an average rating, especially since that finale was so contrived and silly that it made me squirm in my seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting starting premise of Hopkins as animalistic killer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anthropologist Dr. Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins) is released from an African prison by the State Department. He had killed 2 Rwandan park rangers with a wooden club after living with the mountain gorillas for almost 2 years. Ben Hillard (Donald Sutherland) assigns his best psychiatric resident Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.) to evaluate the silent Powell's mental stability. A door alarm sets Powell off in a violent rampage. He is locked up as Theo tries to engage Powell with the help of his daughter Lynn Powell (Maura Tierney). Dacks (John Ashton) is the sadistic guard. John Murray (George Dzundza) is the ineffective prison doctor.The movie starts with Hopkins acting like a mute Hannibal. There is something powerful and scary about Hopkins being silent. The premise loses some of the power as he starts talking. It's so much more powerful as an animalistic creature. I continue to have problems with Cuba as an actor. He is so earnest in every move he makes. It is the most annoying thing. Now this character does have this arrogant superiority. So his acting somehow fits the character. It doesn't make me like him anymore. As for the anti-civilization diatribe, I take it with a handful of salt and swallow it as best I can. The turn in the movie doesn't really help and makes it less interesting. The movie starts with something fascinating but fades into a weak Shawshank.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The whole problem with the film, if there is one, is not thematic or psychological or intellectual. It's technical. The film alternates between ear-splitting screaming and shouting, as Hopkins erupts into sudden violence -- and quiet, almost silent scenes as Gooding murmurs to Hopkins, or Sutherland whispers to Gooding, in oh-so-dramatic, hushed tones.Whispering scenes in movies are nothing new of course. Every actor thinks he's doing something profound when he does a whispering scene... speaking so softly that the performance just HAS to be great.But in "Instinct" the dialogue in these scenes is mixed so quietly that you need subtitles to understand what the hell these people are saying. So you crank the volume up just as far as it will possibly go, or even farther, and then MAYBE you catch a few words. Maybe.Then next thing you know -- BOOM! -- here comes another god-awful explosion of violence, noise, screaming, things smashing, drums pounding, Hopkins leaping around like an ape on PCP... and you have to race over to turn the damn thing down before it splits your goddamn eardrums wide open.Sound mixing has really gone down the tubes every since the wonder of Dolby and 5.1 mixes...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How free are you really? Are you a liberator or a controller?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is the main purpose of a movie? To entertain and amuse in one way or another, right? In other words, captivate your attention for the span of the movie's runtime. Great movies do this and something else ? they inspire you and make you think; maybe even enlighten. That's the power of the art of film. My wife and I just watched 1999's "Instinct" and it does this, which explains my high rating.THE PLOT: Anthropologist Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins) goes missing in Africa for a couple of years; when he is found living with gorillas he kills a couple of rangers and injures others. After a year in prison in Africa, where he refuses to speak, he is extradited to a Florida prison and put in the mental ward. A young psychiatrist, Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.), is assigned his case to see if he can get him to speak and learn what really happened in Africa. Meanwhile Powell's daughter (Maura Tierney) anticipates reconciling with her father, IF Theo can get through to him.There are some peripheral characters, but that's the gist of the story. Some people criticize it as a mix of "Gorillas in the Mist" and "One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest," which is only valid on a surface level. I've seen the latter film (a great film) and "Instinct" stands on its own; in fact, it's quite unique, which is a sign of greatness. The movie stands or falls on Hopkins and Cuba Jr making the characters and their story come alive and seem real to the viewer. They succeeded for my wife and me. Within 20 minutes we found ourselves absorbed into the story and the characters.Some people, like Roger Ebert, criticized that the film takes on too many topics or messages, but I never got this impression, nor did my wife. There are the main themes?the limitations of freedom in conventional society and the abuse of controllers (or "takers")?and there are a few subthemes, like the flaws of our prisons and mental institutions. The film never confused us or gave the impression that it cut off more than it could chew. If you appreciate films like "Grand Canyon" and "One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest" you'll probably value "instinct." Some criticized one aspect of the climax, but it happens. There are documented examples in the USA and all over the world. Also, keep in mind that Powell was imprisoned in the mental ward of the prison, not the maximum security area.Is the story contrived to some degree? Of course it is; all movies are. Filmmakers have to tell a story and make their points within a limited time frame -- usually around two hours -- and so there are always contrived elements, coincidences, etc. The trick is to pull it off without seeming too phony or forced, which is sometimes hard to do and it takes good actors. Thankfully, "Instinct" does a respectable job on this front, perhaps mainly because it has a few great actors, although some viewers may roll their eyes at how the "ace of diamonds" subplot is wrapped up. Regardless, it's in the area of ideas that "Instinct" towers above most movies. BOTTOM LINE: "Instinct" is a psychological drama/thriller that entertains but also makes you think and ponder: How free are we really in society? Are you a giver or a taker? A blesser or an abuser? A liberator or a controller? How can you be freer? How can you escape the manipulations and shackles of others, of society, of "government"? How can you walk free of "the game"? And so much more, like the "doctor" learning from the patient and the humility it takes to learn from someone who's "under" you.The film runs 126 minutes and was shot in central Florida, Uganda and Jamaica.GRADE: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching Sir Anthony Hopkins is always a treat. This Oscar winning thespian makes even second-rate psychological pabulum like "While You Were Sleeping" director Jon Turteltaub's "Instinct" shine. Cast as Ethan Powell, Hopkins plays an eminent anthropologist who disappeared into the Rwandan jungles under mysterious circumstances while studying a tribe of mountain gorillas. Two years later, authorities finally tracked down Powell and found him living with the apes. After Powell killed two trigger-happy park rangers, officials arrested, convicted and incarcerated him for a double homicide. Eventually, Powell is extradited to America for a psychological evaluation. Oscar winner Cuba Gooding, Jr., plays the psychiatric resident who struggles to learn what ignited Powell and why the famous primatologist has refused to talk since his arrest.Ostensibly, "Instinct" takes place in the unsavory, claustrophobic confines of the psychotic ward at Harmony Bay Correctional Facility. This Florida maximum security penitentiary rivals the lock-ups in both "The Snake Pit" (1948) and "The Midnight Express" (1978). Rwandan officials have turned the well-known researcher back over to U.S. authorities, and Powell is flown back to meet his old friend and colleague, Ben Hillard (Donald Sutherland of "M.A.S.H."), for an evaluation. Hillard's ambitious protégé, Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding, Jr., of "Jerry Maguire") requests the assignment. Caulder knows that success with Powell will garner not only professional accolades but also a book deal. Meanwhile, when he arrives at Miami Airport, Powell goes berserk after an alarm system frightens him. Consequently, authorities confine him at Harmony Bay and Caulder begins his evaluation. Initially, Powell wants nothing to do with Caulder. Eventually, during a series of interviews, Caulder and Powell forge a friendship, and Caulder feels confident enough that he can get his patient out of prison and back at home with his daughter Lynn (Maura Tierney of "Liar Liar") and her mother.Nothing rewarding is won easily in a good movie. Theo Caulder finds life at Harmony Bay nothing like school at the University of Miami. Hillard reminds Caulder that as psychiatric resident he is only there to appraise Powell, not win his release. Nevertheless, Caulder launches a crusade. Harmony Bay with its callous warden, overcrowded conditions, sadistic guards, and burned-out staff psychiatrist hamper him. In the process, Caulder converts psychiatrist John Murray (George Dzundza of "The Beast"), aggravates Warden Keefer (John Aylward of "Finding Graceland"), indicts Guard Dacks (John Ashton of "King Kong Lives"), and wins over the poor inmates who have suffered from abuse and neglect.Anthony Hopkins brings his Hannibal Lector persona to the role, but he looks nothing like Lector. In fact, Hopkins resembles Sean Connery from his early scenes in "The Rock." Ethan Powell sports shaggy, shoulder-length, gray hair as well as an Ernst Hemingway beard. He dominates "Instinct" with his steely-eyed presence and his crisp dialogue delivery. Essentially, Powell serves as the human equivalent of a moral compass. Wrongly imprisoned, he represents a character as much as a cause, but Hopkins never lets you overlook the human qualities in Ethan Powell. Happily, "Instinct" winks at the audience occasionally where Powell is concerned. When Rwandan authorities load him into a truck, they put him in with two vicious Dobermans. At the end of the trip, the authorities find Powell lounging in the rear with the dogs resting comfortably on his lap! If imitation is the greatest form of flattery, then director John Turteltaub and "Sharkey's Machine" scenarist Gerald DiPego have flattered the best. They have contrived "Instinct" from bits and pieces of better movies, such as "One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Gorillas in the Mist," "Silence of the Lambs," "Cool Hand Luke," "The Wild Child," "The Shawshank Redemption," "Mighty Joe Young," and "Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan." Incredibly, their strategy works. "Instinct" is as much a saga about the trouble characters on-screen as it is about the human condition. Indeed, you've heard everything in this movie before, but Turteltaub and DiPego recycle it with an air of sincerity that makes it quite touching. They pace the plot so that just when you think that everything is going to work out wonderfully, the bottom drops out. In this respect, "Instinct" resembles the 1965 Sean Connery World War II prison saga "The Hill." "Instinct" has a lot on its mind, and most of it is reassuring clichés. The gorillas display more altruism than humans. Meanwhile, people behave considerably more savage than animals. Powell condemns mankind as takers who exploit. He gorillas that he studied, for example, live in peace. Humans, on the other hand, spoil for war. Powell teaches Caulder that modern-day man enjoys little freedom. Instead, the illusion of freedom blinds him. He braves a daily gauntlet of withering career pressures that require conformity to authority. As a result, the messages and issues are familiar, facile, but feature enough truth to salve the soul. Turteltaub orchestrates the clichés and sentiments so adroitly that you sympathize with the protagonist even when you know that you're being shamelessly manipulated about their plight.Although Hopkins and Gooding dominate the action, they get great support from Donald Sutherland at his avuncular best as Caulder's boss, Maura Tierney, and George Dzundza. John Ashton, best known as Eddie Murphy's sidekick in the "Beverly Hills Cop" franchise, excels as a ruthless prison guard who pits the inmates against themselves to maintain control over them. Ashton is every bit as despicable as Louis Fletcher's strong-willed Nurse Ratched in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" As Warden Keefer, Aylward spends less time on-screen than Ashton, but he uses his moments to convey a chilling air of menace.Ultimately, "Instinct" ruminates about man's depravity. Sure, the movie sounds like a sermon at times, but "Instinct" shows more heart than most movies, and you leave it feeling good about yourself even when you know it is artifice masquerading as art. The na?ve happy ending is enough to make you applaud, even when you realize that it is childishly preposterous. Nevertheless, the satisfaction derived from such a wrap-up makes "Instinct" all the more gratifying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really surprised when I watched this. This is a way underrated movie, but I believe movies like this will always be underrated since (obviusly) the majority of the population has the average IQ and don't understand the message and don't understand the art.That's why movies like 'Casino Royale' and other 'no-brain' movies (a 'showcase-of-special-effects' genre) will always earn more.. A brilliant movie which, unfortunately, I can't recommend to everyone, simply because it is not an average movie. This is a movie for intelligent and emotional people.If I offended anyone here, great, turn on your brain and check out this movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reveals a truth we all deny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superficially, this movie might seem like a "Save the Nature" sort of movie. But it is not one. In fact, it hints more at saving humans from the clutches of civilization.Its storyline is simple and highly effective. And the portrayal of the characters is just about perfect, though the jungle scenes have been a bit overdone.What I really liked about this movie was the fact that though it displayed the natural beauty of the forests and the animals, it was also able to convey the feeling that how much we really do want to get out of the rut and feel free and one with nature. We live all our lives pretending to be alive and don't realize that till we die. This movie inspires us to experience reality and recognize the worthlessness of our pretensions.And it raises another question very well. We humans take acceptance by other species as granted. Is that really true? Or are we just fooling ourselves?Coming to the movie itself, the performances by Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr. are excellent. In fact, after watching this movie, I couldn't have imagined anyone else in their roles. The satirical and contemptuous look in Dr. Powell's (Hopkins) eyes and the questioning and awed look in Cuba Gooding Jr.'s are, in my view, exactly what the writer of this story might have imagined for its characters.The side cast is also quite good. The background score is very appealing and does a good job in making the film powerful.All in all, a very good movie and, as mentioned by another user, a film well ahead of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somehow it works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is possibly the most multi-derivative movie ever made - a sort of Gorillas in the Mist meets Shawshank Redemption and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, with a guest appearance by Hannibal Lecter and multiple references to other movies. Incredibly, it works - well, apart from the rather ridiculous transformation of Hopkins from a raving, wild, bestial madman who never speaks to a loquacious character with a deeply philosophical frame of mind. After that, it looks like heading for the rocks of eco-cliche about how civilization has destroyed our beautiful symbiosis with the natural world, but cleverly avoids this and all other extremes and actually creates some original ideas out of the pastiche. It comes off as a very good character study of two arrogant men, each of whom thinks he has nothing to learn from the other, who eventually come to a mutually uplifting understanding. The main strengths of the movie are the two leads, with Gooding doing a good job and Hopkins being brilliant (as he usually is) even making his ridiculous character change almost believable. The end of the film looks like settling for an in-again mode, a bit like Sling Blade, but suddenly and convincingly reverts to Cuckoo's Nest. It is not wholly satisfactory, but a lot more thought-provoking than the average film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not liked by most people. Here's why: It is uncomfortable for the people who watch it. It shows us how little we really have to say around this planet. And for most people, this is a vision which they don't like. After all, Jon Turteltaub did a wonderful job. The film is definitely not a movie that combines "Gorillas in the mist" with "One flew over the cuckoo's nest", it is an introduction into a different way of thinking. The movie says: "Switch back one or two gears and take a look at the bigger picture." Dr. Powell could also have been a completely different character, for example a woodcutter who is suddenly troubled by his deed of cutting down whole biotopes. Or a hunter. Or even a office clerk. The film is about breaking out of common understanding. Something has to be given up for it, and in this case it's what we call "civilization". What the movie wants to show is that our "civilization" is not a progress to, but a regress from what is good for us and our planet. We are less far civilized than the old civilizations. Writer Daniel Quinn doesn't say "go live on a tree", he says: "think it over and make it better". And I think we still have lots of things to review and improve. Conclusion: Watch this movie not as an ape-story, but as a guidance to a better thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvelous - one of the big roles of Sir Anthony Hopkins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to see a splendid movie with absolutely superb acting, terrific scenes and touching story, "Instinct" is a wonderful flick to pick. Legendary "The Silence of the lambs", bloodcurdling "Dracula", gorgeous "Legends of the fall", powerful "Amistad", impressive "Meet Joe Black" - just a few examples of Sir Anthony Hopkins' excellent performances only in the 90's. He has a power and an ability to cease the screen with his charisma. But, if you haven't seen "Instinct" you've truly missed one of his big ones.Donald Sutherland's role is small and quite insignificant on his career if we look back at the amount of movies he's been in but we must not forget Cuba Gooding Jr. - bloke who won his first Oscar only 8 years after his debut movie. He is just as good as he was in "Jerry Maguire". He devotes himself into this role like it's one of the most important films of his life. Maybe it is. This movie is a notable part of both Anthony Hopkins' and Cuba Gooding Jr.'s career and a must-see for their fans. If you liked "One flew over the cuckoo's nest" you simply have to watch "Instinct".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>absurd psychodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The bottom of the pop-psychology barrel is scraped with "Instinct," a bizarre, pointless amalgam of "The Silence of the Lambs," "Gorillas in the Mist" and "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" that represents a major stumble in the careers of both Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr.Hopkins stars as a research anthropologist who abandons family, home and, eventually, sanity to take up residence, Sigourney Weaver-style, with a family of apes that, of course, just welcome him fully into their ersatz anthropoid family unit. While he's making nicey-nice with the gorillas, a band of hunters attacks the camp, killing most of their number, a crime for which he is returned to the states in a strange state of self-imposed silence. Gooding jr. plays the crack psychiatrist assigned to work with this violently deranged man and attempt to draw the truth from him about what really happened in the deep dark jungles of Africa.Any movie that begins with the cerebral Hopkins singlehandedly demolishing an entire airport terminal, while scores of armed guards struggle to subdue him, is not destined to register high on the credibility meter. The screenplay, in fact, degenerates into a snail-paced series of increasingly ludicrous confrontations between the deranged killer and the doctor, wherein the psychiatrist, predictably, is set straight on some eternal verities by the psychotic truth teller. How often must we be subjected to this idiotic notion that all therapists are really only trying to work out their own redemptions and that the deeply emotionally disturbed patients somehow possess the requisite wisdom we mere rational mortals do not to help them achieve this? The film trods this tried-and-true path right up to a thoroughly wretched final scene that defies all credibility and lapses completely into the absurd. At one point, to achieve his redemption, Gooding Jr. rallies the psychotic prisoners to band together and stand up against the tyrranical prison forces arrayed against them - in a scene filled with the kind of phony emotional uplift that is always backed up by a swelling, sobbing orchestral composition and endless shots of characters looking meaningfully upward in teary-eyed pride and determination. If only Jack Nicholson had had such an advocate!Cuba Gooding Jr., though he certainly tries hard, lacks the gravitas necessary to carry off a leading role of this magnitude, and Hopkins provides his customary grating mannerisms as he lectures us about the virtues of uncivilized, primitive Man. "Instinct" is thoroughly derivative yet it does have the chutzpah to make momentary fun of itself by including Sigourney Weaver as the butt of a one-liner. It is the one moment of cleverness, honesty and courage in an otherwise dull, incredible and utterly uninteresting film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freedom is not just a dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After an amazing book (Ishmael), Jon Turteltaub made a movie (Instinct) equally amazing. Ethan Powell, an anthropologist studying gorillas get arrested for murder in Rwanda (Africa). Depicting the beginnings of humanity and the consequences of evolution, Ethan Powell talks about consumerism, the dominion and the every kind devastation performed by the called, 'takers'.This movie focus more then just freedom. Talks about the past/present and future. This movie is questioning the human role in this planet, the size of his ambition, which finishes with attempts of dominion over the nature itself. For those who do not know, the Virunga gorillas are constantly killed by the 'takers'. Virunga National Park situated in the Republic of Congo is a place with a biggest amount of gorillas living freely on earth, and this movie tries to show the importance of such an act.Specking about the performances, although Anthony Hopkins didn't spoke half of the movie he made an excellent performance, which the best one was the death of the gorillas that he considered his family. Was one of the most sensitizing scene I ever saw. Cuba Gooding Jr, is constantly criticized for because of a poor performance/representation which I do not totally agree. I think the critics focused less in the action and more on the character (Theo Caulder). Although, I agree that Cuba Gooding Jr didn't made a greatest of the performances.Overall, the movie was quite enjoyable to watch, with a good story, a excellent dramatization taken apart by Antony Hopkins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I picked up this movie on DVD for a very reasonable price, I'd heard of it but didn't know anything about they plot or who starred in it. I was sold on the fact Anthony Hopkins is in it and curious about how Cuba Gooding Jr would play alongside an incredible actor like Hopkins.Hopkins for me in this movie once again proves how brilliant he can be in a challenging role, he is effortless, natural and subtle even when he doesn't speak, his eyes, his movements pour out emotion and feeling. He raises what could have been an average movie into something heartfelt and inspiring. I really wanted a big scene with Hopkins in-which he verbally took his performance over the top and blew it out of the water with intensity and drama but I was more than happy with the softer more subtle side of his performance.I soo wanted to love Cuba Gooding Jr performance in this movie, he has a very easy to watch and enjoyable quality about him which iv found in all they other movies iv watched starring him, however in this movie at times I felt as though at times he was a little bit out of his depth. To go up against an actor the calibre of Anthony Hopkins you really need to be able to stand your ground and bring more to the table as far as depth and intensity and I didn't feel that from Cuba. At times it felt as though he was trying to hard and was trying to match Hopkins in the performance stakes. Don't get me wrong he did a great job and was enjoyable and I commend him on his efforts but it felt as though there was something missing in his performance.The plot wasn't my cup of tea but it won me around and totally had me engaged me. The scenes with the Gorillas and Hopkins, were touching and beautifully directed.Overall, this movie is definitely worth watching, its easy-going, warm and touching but at times brutal and harrowing. Its an engaging mixed bag of emotions that rolled up make for an inspiring and entertaining movie which delivers ultimately an important message</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A drama involving relationship with animals has everything to be pretty clichéd and predictable, but happily, "Instinct" isn't. Cuba Gooding Jr. is a psychiatrist who tries everything in his power to understand why Ethan (Anthony Hopkins' character) is so violent and mute. Some people have stated Hopkins' acting in this picture is great; for the first 30 minutes his character didn't speak a word, so I was ready to ask you guys if you find it hard to act without saying any words-- but fortunately, after he starts speaking we can notice how good he is. Some people also have complained that Hopkins' repeated his classic character from "LAMBS"; I may agree they're similar characters, but we can see some differences between them. I find the conversations in this movie very well written, and they helped the story to flow, delivering an engaging and entertaining film. Of course I noticed how Hollywood it is when they stated that prison was a "maximum-security prison" when actually they have only 3 or 4 incompetent officers a lá "Scream" series. All in all, "Instinct" is an interesting picture involving human nature and our relationship with animals, nature.. and humans!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an awfully sentimental movie, with nice acting and promising script. But, sorrowfully, it's also one of the movies which you find yourself asking after its end; what does it say ?! The problem is within this script. It's not only promising, it rather has so great factors : The thrilling psychological investigation about the truth of strange murders, exploring a vague yet interesting man, a despotic reign vs. oppressed people, the animal vs. the rational human who became more beastly, the love and family vs. money and position. The tragedy though is that this movie didn't pick out well what to say out of all of these beautiful meanings. Or maybe it picked out saying them all in the same time (!), to end up with nothing complete.(Anthony Hopkins) is an excellent actor but I longed for someone who's physically bigger, such as Nolte, Hackman, or Connery (who I knew later that the role was written for him). The chemistry wasn't that palpable between him and (Cuba Gooding Jr.) as well. (Cuba Gooding) gave only 90 % of him for the role, and the script embarrassed him already with inconsistent aims; does he have to be more concern about love (the mentor himself forgot to express his love to his daughter !!), does he have to be more human and less beastly (that was the problem of the prison's managers, not him !), was he after the wrong goals all along ? (then what he got from that man to get right ?!). So the moment in which he tells Hopkins, so teary and desperate, "You taught me how to live" was undoubtedly the highest peak of sentimental crap this movie could achieve !The soft piano score got on my nerves since it made the movie's soundtrack as the same as any other Hollywood movie with romantic feel. I thought I was watching (Patch Adams ? 1998) for god's sake! It was boring score and surely it obliterated big part of the movie's singularity. On the contrary, the sound effects worked highly. They incarnated smartly many important emotions and turning points. The end with the lead runs away made it kind of mix between (Scent of a Woman ? 1992) and (The Shawshank Redemption ? 1994). So was it about how the people became so inhuman therefore the only available freedom would be by living with the animals?! That's the closest meaning it could reach, however by unsettled script and after nonplused time. What makes you sad is that it had real original factors to be one-of-a-kind movie, but it blew it. If something (Instinct) missed, and extremely needed to be true magical, then it's the instinct of being focused.</fullReview>

Having worked in several hospital psych units, I can speak with some authority about how psych assessments are conducted, including court-mandated assessments. It always annoys me that Hollywood mental health professionals seem to have never had any recognizable professional training.

The next ninety minutes amazed me as the level of absurdity snowballed into a smudge mark of two solid actors' careers. The story line was diluted with so many ridiculous subplots that any thought-provoking message that this film may have contained was lost amid a myriad of senseless scenarios. I discount my earlier comment about this being the stupidest movie I have ever seen only to say that this is the stupidest movie I have seen that intended to be poignant. The only redeeming quality of the film was the jungle sequences portraying the silver back gorillas. Unfortunately, these scenes only comprise about 5% of the entire film. I would strongly recommend that fans of either Cuba Gooding Jr., Anthony Hopkins stay away from this movie as it only detracts from their careers. Donald Sutherland only has a supporting role, but his fans should stay away as well just to be safe.</fullReview>

They apparently didn't have a good clue how to bring this premise to a meaningful conclusion. Too many prison cliches, and attempts at melodrama which didn't quite work. The only really good scene was where Hopkins showed Gooding about losing the "illusion" of freedom and control.With lesser actors this movie would be a "3".

He seemed uncomfortable and seemed to be trying hard to get into his character. Hopkins' character also left much to be desired -- it seemed he started talking only to save us from hours of watching "This is Dr. Theo Calder... Dr. Ethan Powell..." bit. Same goes for Tierney's character: undeveloped. They all needed some more baking.There were good developments with the apes. I was able to identify immediately with the ape scenes than with the prison interviews.Could it be that I am expecting another "Silence of the Lambs?" I couldn't help comparing the two -- Jodie Foster's performance was a definite class above Cuba Gooding's. I'm inclined to believe the writing was left much to be desired, and the directing didn't help. I felt the same for Hokins' Powell vs. Lecter comparison.If you see Instinct, then be sure to watch Lambs. It'll leave you filling the emptiness you'll feel afterwards.</fullReview>

A pre warning though, although I'm not entirely in belief of the evolution standpoint, I like to watch movies of the such nonetheless. But some people may be offended by this standpoint. If you're one of these people, don't say I didn't warn you. But you could very well love it as I have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminds me of another movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anthony Hopkins is a tremendous actor with many memorable roles, Hannibal Lecter being the most immortal of them all. This is one of the lesser, but equally great roles eclipsed by an unoriginal plot and dialogue. Instinct is a plagarized story taken from dozens of man/ape stories, and even reminiscent of Gorillas in the Mist and other movies about the "philosophy" of nature and its creatures. Instinct would have been groundbreaking if it had been released ten years earlier before any of its predecessors, but it didn't so I'm content to say it was an okay movie. The outline of the movie is also very common (unorthodox teacher/baffled but eager student). One scene in particular that I like is a scene in where Anthony Hopkin explains to Cuba Gooding Jr. (another tremendous actor) the nature of power, which sounds very much like the 6th century philosopher Boethius. Just think Gorillas In the Midst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shallow, self-contradictory film that fails on every level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are three fundamental flaws in this film. First, it fails as entertainment because of the crude way it beats you over the head with a "moral" that is shallow, simplistic and, in the final analysis, plain wrong. Second, it fails as a story because it ultimately undermines its own message. Third, it fails as a movie because it constantly resorts to "telling" us things it should be "showing" us.The movie attempts to tattoo into us its thesis of "nature good, civilization bad" along with the subtext that Theo (Gooding) would be much happier if he was willing to let go of "control". This is the shallow and simplistic part: despite its many flaws, civilization has a lot going for it, including not dying of every childhood disease that comes along, not being dominated by the most physically powerful, and not being deprived of a mate because the big silverback keeps all the females to himself - all characteristics of gorilla society omitted from this film. The movie never addresses this complexity: it is totally one dimensional. Furthermore, the assumption that the natural world is so admirable is being undermined by modern research that shows that other primates and even dolphins are prone to acts of senseless violence just as we are, such as dolphins killing porpoises for fun. This is the plain wrong part: The world is much more complex than this movie wants to think about.Even if you wanted to accept the movie's thesis, it undermines itself immediately by presenting the proponent of this position as an aggressive, unpredictable man who is guilty of a particularly brutal act of murder and prone to violent outbursts of uncontrollable rage. He also - until Gooding intervenes - has a totally broken relationship with his family. This is supposed to be the "poster child" for the natural state? Conversely, Theo, representing civilization, is thoughtful, caring, and intelligent, and is the catalyst for bringing father and daughter back together, using the very skills that only civilization could have given him. Meanwhile, the film-makers show us cardboard cut-out villains (greedy poachers, sadistic guards) to illustrate the evils of civilization: yet who would ever claim that these straw men represent humankind at anything but its worst?What finally dooms this movie, however, is that even in trying to show us nature at its best and mankind at its worst, and then ask to "root" for nature, it fails. Long and tedious scenes of the two stars lecturing each other are undermined and contradicted by their (pitifully few) actions, leaving us merely confused. Is there supposed to be a subtle double-cross here, with the real, hidden message being to attack the simplistic assumptions of "nature good, mankind bad"? Or is it just bad writing?Sometimes, you watch a bad movie and know that there was a good movie struggling to get made; this is not the case here. A bad script got made into a bad movie that not even these two stars could save.In summary, this botched attempt to say something profound fails because it only has something shallow to say, and says it badly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cliché-ridden, simple minded and derivative dross</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After two years of living amongst the gorillas in the Rwandan jungle, anthropologist Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins) is arrested for murdering two park rangers and wounding three others, and slapped in chains to be carted off to Harmony Bay, Florida, a harsh maximum security prison for the criminally insane. Cuba Gooding Jr is Dr Theo Calder, the diligent and ambitious young whelp of a psychiatrist sent to investigate the matter further. Fascinated by what would force an otherwise reasonable and peaceful man into such acts of violence, Calder believes that Powell is in fact perfectly sane, and sets about trying to get him released, with one eye on a more personal agenda of getting a pretty impressive book deal out of the case.I'm not sure how fair it would be to judge Daniel Quinn's novel 'Ishmael' on the basis of this lame adaptation, as once processed through the Hollywood sausage-machine any would-be interesting ideas have been no doubt been stripped away to the extent that nothing more than the old well-worn civilisation-vs-barbarism chestnut remains. To add weight to this rather tired argument we are hauled through a checklist of recent cinematic cliché's and cross-references, leading one to the inevitable conclusion that no one involved in the project could have had any conviction in the central concept at all. Instead of challenging audience preconceptions, why not make them comfortable with a mish-mash of familiar stock characters and situations lifted from a dozen or so successful recent films? Thus Gooding rehashes Clarice Starling's wide-eyed ingenue (and very badly too), whose self-assured and professional demeanor initially draws blanks with Hopkins' reprisal of his Hannibal Lector role (he even opens a cage with his pen at one point!) Alternating between brooding mutism and articulate lucidity with complete disregard for consistency, Hopkins finally begins to show chinks in his armour, before our resolute young protagonist finally breaks through, accompanied by a loud orchestral swell on the soundtrack. These early scenes are tedious in the extreme, with sporadic shocks sequences and loud noises thrown into the rather perfunctory exchanges of dialogue presumably to 'add tension' to the proceedings. Elsewhere there is the 'barbaric treatment of the inmates' sub-story, bringing to mind the 'us-and them' slant of 'One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest' or 'The Shawshank Redemption' and providing yet another crusade for our dogged hero, the American Dream incarnate.One is always conscious of 'Instinct's artifice, completely diffusing any power it might have had with a derivative and superficial script made for an audience whose only point of reference to the real world is through the mutual phosphotic flux of the TV screen. The narrow focus is exemplified by the key-scene of the film's central argument - that of 'civilised society' taking from nature - in the flashback detailing the murders which led to Hopkins' incarceration. Here a troop of African park rangers ("the takers") attack the tribe of gorillas in which Hopkins as made his home. No explanation is given for why they do this other than to give the film a dramatic raison d'etre. The milieu of Rwanda has been chosen because yes, it has a jungle and yes, it has gorillas. There has been poaching there too, not too mention a brutal and lengthy civil war, but this goes unmentioned, as even the slightest degree of social context falls way outside of the scope of the film's narrative drive. It instead goes for the collective lowest common denominator approach, where primitive nature equals 'good', and civilised man equals 'bad'.The symbolism is crude and hackneyed. In an early flashback scene, as Hopkins opines about the need to leave 'civilisation' on the voiceover, we are treated to a close-up of his binoculars left discarded and hanging from a tree, followed by a cutaway of him squatting beneath a large banana leaf in the pouring rain amongst his fellow primates. Elsewhere there is the specious juxtaposition between the natural idyll of life amongst the gorillas and the more violent urban jungle as represented by Harmony Bay, clearly intended to stand in as a microcosm for a violent modern society. This is rendered emotively and with painstaking literal-mindedness in the parallel scenes of the attack of the gorilla camp and the prison warder's violent suppression of a riot. Ultimately such analogies fail because both milieus are portrayed with such portentous simplicity that any analogy with the real world is lost. In fact, the psychological practices used by Gooding, and the depiction of life inside a top-security mental institution are so unconvincingly done (not too mention crudely sensationalist) that film never has a chance of transcending its routine structure. Boredom sets in long before the two hour running time has expired: It's never in any doubt that Hopkins will escape from 'civilisation' and Gooding will discover his own inner wildman. 'Instinct' must represent something of a career low for Anthony Hopkins, who is now talking of quitting the film industry altogether (presumably after receiving the pay cheque for this). We would expect little more from director John Turteltaub, who was responsible for amongst other things the mawkish Travolta vehicle 'Phenomenon' (1996) and 'Cool Runnings' (1993), the oh-so-hilarious comedy about the Jamaican bob-sleigh team featuring John Candy. This film is atrocious by any standards, but made even more so by it's own sense of worthiness and it's vapid intellectual posturing. It gets one thing right though - you wouldn't find a gorilla stupid enough to fork out 5 quid to watch this dross.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that original, not that great...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of those movies that just didn´t work for me. I think the major flaw here is the plot, which is very patchy and not particularly original. It´s kind of GORILLAS IN THE MIST meets SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION meets ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOOS NEST.The script is poor and so these two hardworking, and very good actors never get a chance to do their jobs properly. The plot, as it unfolds, is premature. There are two going-absolutely-nowhere scenes between Gooding Jnr and ´the crazy professor´s daughter. It was as if the director needed some time-fillers. Also the dialogue launches both men into great moments of emotional intensity, but without any build-up. The film also explores the great revelation the professor has in the jungle, but there is no attempt at all to deal with the fact that he abandoned his family. You get the feeling the director wants us to feel sorry for the primatologist, though the portrayal of the relationship he has with his (real) family is so flittingly dealt with that you wonder why his family want him back in the first place. It just doesn´t make sense! Also, without giving it all away, the ending is without any logic or explanation. Not even Houdini was that good!We left the cinema feeling most unsatisfied. Give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most bad films shoot themselves down pretty early on. Instinct starring Anthony Hopkins, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Maura Tierney isn't that bad, but what's wrong with it flashes like a big warning signal before the first ten minutes are up.Donald Sutherland in Instinct plays Dr Ben Hillard. He's the head psychiatrist at some teaching institution and is in charge of an earnest, "slightly pissed off" and ambitious star student called Dr Theo Calder played by Cuba Gooding Jr.In that first ten minutes or so, Dr Hillard nods approvingly as Dr Calder puts an unhappy self delusional patient through a reality check. He then assigns Calder, accompanied by alarmingly illogical reasoning, to interview a new patient (former shrink Dr Ethan Powell) who has been brought in from darkest Africa with what appear to be severe psychological and legal problems.Powell (Anthony Hopkins) apparently lived with some gorillas for two years whilst incidentally murdering one of the human locals. But most importantly he won't utter a word. For Calder, Powell represents a fabulous career and publishing opportunity.By now the credibility of Instinct had been well and truly blown, mostly by Donald Sutherland's character. By the time Dr Calder descends to the horrors of the prison in which Powell has been caged, with its prescribed retinue of demented crazies and sadistic guards, it was obvious that most of the setup of Instinct was totally ill conceived and that in particular Dr Hillard should have not even existed.In particular there was no reason really why Calder couldn't have been at least one of the residing prison psychiatrists which would have done away altogether with the overdressed and awkward Donald Sutherland performance. The world would have then been a better place for it.So what was good about Instinct? Well, thank goodness the other main characters were as competent as they were. Anthony Hopkins, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Maura Tierny did a good job of rescuing what could have easily been an utter mess.Seeing Hopkins in jail instantly recalls Hannibal the Cannibal, this time with bad hair, or perhaps Sean Connery in The Rock before his makeover. But Hopkins never seems to make a mess of any part he's in, even one as trite as this one.Cuba Gooding Jr. manages to portray a bright, young ambitious and energetic professional really well; he was probably playing himself.Maura Tierney, the other woman in Forces Of Nature, is attractive and effective as the sad, beautiful, estranged daughter of the mad and bad Ethan Powell.We've seen it all before. But predictability and a rampant disease of stock characters and tried before plot elements will only please the most undemanding of movie goers. Let's hope that there aren't too many of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with those who say it's superficial, bordering on Disney-sweet, in its treatment of the theme, but the theme is just too important to be reduced by a mediocre dramatization. The book that it's based on is _Ishmael_ by Daniel Quinn (you'll find it in any library), and is original and thought-provoking. In the book it is a gorilla that talks to a young woman, replaced by Hopkins and Gooding in the movie. The book is formed mainly as a series of questions and answers, that try to get deeper in to the theme of how (and when) humans became opposed and separated from rest of nature. Quinn is former anthropologist (as Hopkins in the film), and the fundamental theme of his investigation is cultural predispositions: where do all these ideas come from that make us see ourselves as separate from nature, and superior?Don't waste money on the film, buy the book instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can I have my 7$ back?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer for this movie was downright misleading.... The trailer shows you a psycho in chains violently stabbing at cuba gooding with a pencil snapping "you never had control you only thought you did" quick cuts dark prison scenes and an intentionally vague past make the viewers of the preview think hey i'm gonna see a real thriller reminiscent of Silence of the Lambs, and with Cuba Gooding (who I thought was excellent in Jerry McGuire) and Anthony Hopkins (incredible psycho in Silence of the Lambs) it's a sure fire smash....Well the first sign of disappointment was the opening credits when I saw the credit to Daniel Quinn from Ishmael...A moment on the book for those of you haven't read it, It is a very intelligently written book that slowly takes you through a class taught by a gorilla to a single pupil, He teaches him of the higher order of life. How man and nature can exist in harmony and how our civilization is fundamentally sinful...The book and in turn the movie paint society as a lost cause stopping just short of proposing we all move back to the caves...All though the book was well written it was way too naturalist for me. I tend to believe the world around us is what we make of it....I digress.... Back to the film. So I am thinking ok its not the psycho thriller i expected, and although i didnt like the message of Quinn's book I do think it is one of the best written books I've read, and given the caliber of actors maybe it will be ok.I was wrong... The movie scathes the surface of the concepts presented in the novel as well as thinking about the thriller that was advertised. Many concepts are introduced but not explained. Examples, the term Taker is VERY important to the novel and the whole lesson hopkins tries to teach gooding, it is used throughout but we only once get anything resembling a definition and it is more of a counter-definition. In one scene hopkins sketches a map of the world and tells cuba gooding that it is time for a history lesson, introduces the aforementioned counter-definition of taker and promptly forgets to teach gooding the history which in the book is very important to the lesson being taught. After gooding leaves the cell and the map, without learning his history, he takes hopkins on a fieldtrip to the zoo. Here, Hopkins who has refused to answer anything Gooding puts to him, demanding that he sit there to learn the lesson as he is prepared to teach it or leave, promptly tells Cuba the entire story of the day of the killings. Why all of a sudden did Hopkins give up this info? Shortly after gathering all of the info its time for his day in court. Now cuba gooding is sent in to evaluate hopkins, the evaluation period is shortened by 8 days due to a tiff with the warden and although gooding's testimony and report will be key the hearing is on the last day of his evaluation. Wouldn't it be more realistic for there to be at least the day after is evaluation period ended? Not to mention his evaluation period was scheduled to run another 8 days. Not that it matters Hopkins never gets his day in court because he protests that his map has been washed from the walls and violence follows. He promptly returns to silence. Now here is my problem with this. The man spends a year in an african prison for what are arguably justifable crimes, but he remains silent for over a year not speaking to a single human. As gooding surmizes hopkins while imprisoned is "acting like an animal you can beat me and cage me but you cant break me", maybe he should have said you cant break me unless of course you erase my map which is useless at this point anyway?I think the writers were debating how heavily to introduce the themes of the book and wound up mearly toying with them and rewriting their way into corners. These themes aren't the only things they were toying with introducing. There are several points at which a romantic relationship with Hopkins daughter and gooding is hinted towards but of course not followed up. And what about Godding's the best line in the film "should we tear down the cities and walk off into the jungle like you?" another unclearly/never answered question.The ending is also terrible.In short this film is slow at points, riddled with logistical inconsistencies and hints of themes which aren't properly followed up on. I am confused as to wheter this was intended to be a psycho thriller or a theology lesson and I think the writer is too. For a film trying to teach a lesson that is designed to give us answers to the empty feelings of living in a large society it leaves a great number of things unanswered about the solution.Instinct....InStinked</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Forgettable Psychological Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>INSTINCT was an obvious bit of attempted Oscar bait from director Jon Turteltaub back in 1999. Turteltaub is the man responsible for such generic adventure fare as the NATIONAL TREASURE movies and generic family fare as THE KID. So what better man to direct a generic wannabe award winner? INSTINCT has all of the ingredients to be a critical favorite but it's missing that one crucial element: being a good movie. I'm not saying it's a bad movie because it's actually not. It's just forgettable. You probably won't feel let down after spending two hours watching this movie, but it won't take much longer to forget that it existed. INSTINCT wants to be tense. It wants to be inspirational. It wants to tug at the heartstrings. But it doesn't, because it's so transparent in its intentions. Or at least, I thought so. The movie follows an aspiring psychologist named Theo Caulder, played by Cuba Gooding Jr. He's assigned to a unique case by his mentor (Donald Sutherland) and sees an opportunity to jump-start his career with a bestseller. Accomplished anthropologist Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins) has been transferred to a prison in the US from Rwanda, where he was doing time for murdering men after disappearing into the jungles for nearly two years. Upon Powell's return to civilization, he is a changed man. Feral and refusing to speak, Caulder dedicates his time to Powell, determined to find out what happened in those jungles, why he disappeared, and what drove him to murder.What bothered me about this movie was that it couldn't decide what it wanted to focus on. There are two main through-lines in this movie, running at the same time. There's, of course, the main storyline with Caulder and Powell and the story of their interactions, and then there's an entirely different unrelated subplot of how the prison that Powell is transferred to is a miserable place where the guards abuse the mentally handicapped and the prison shrink does nothing for his patients. In my opinion, these are two different movies and conflict with each other. Once you finally get involved in the Powell/Caulder interviews, it rips you away from that to show how Caulder is inspired to reform the prison's system for handling its mental patients. And it bounces back and forth so often that I just didn't care as much as I should for either storyline. Subplots are OK, but they don't generally get equal screen time with the main story because it detracts from it. Besides, we've already got movies that handle uncaring mental health care in bigger and better ways (e.g. ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST). I watched this movie because I wanted to see Hopkins and Gooding Jr. to engage in a mental game of cat and mouse. I wanted a good, tense psychological drama and I got it?in bits and pieces. Each story was entertaining enough but the entire movie ends up leaving you (well, I suppose it left me anyway) unfulfilled.Another issue I had with the movie is that it's populated with characters we've already seen before. No one in the movie feels like an original creation. The obvious example is Anthony Hopkins as Ethan Powell. In this movie, he's just a toned down version of his more famous (and more interesting) Hannibal Lecter. He was probably the worst choice for the role because of the obvious parallels, unless the filmmakers were counting on people to make that connection and hoped it would add to it. Cuba Gooding Jr. is every movie psychologist you've ever seen rolled up into one man as Caulder. He does well enough, as this was back before he thought SNOW DOGS was a smart career move. But, come on?we've seen this shtick before and he isn't bringing anything new to it. His optimism is meant to be inspirational...he IS going to reach this troubled man! He IS going to make this horrible prison a better place for it's inhabitants! Blah. The rest of the cast fails to make any sort of impressions as shallow caricatures. There's the disillusioned prison psychiatrist who's given up hope?the evil guard who finds entertainment in turning the strongest of the patients against the weak. There's Powell's daughter, long since given up on her absent father. It's just all so?been there, done that. If they'd focused on one story (the Powell/Caulder one, naturally) and fleshed out their characters into real people, this movie might've been what it was blatantly aspiring to be. Instead, it's good enough for a quiet evening but don't go in expecting the inspiring tale they're trying to sell.</fullReview>

A number of the scenes are quite predictable and some of them are downright fanciful (Like a psychiatrist taking a 'dangerous psychotic murderer' to the zoo? and at night afterhours?

		<shortDescription>A film ahead of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read reviews in here ( IMDb ) and many other places from esteemed critics and the general opinion is that this film sinks under its own weight. People say that it is contrived and it contains stories already done a thousand times over. They say that this is a bleeding heart type film that depicts humans as the bad guy and shows how wonderful nature is and how that this theme is all rubbish. Reviewers go on to say that this is a terrible film and one that should be avoided and that we don't need this crap in our cinemas. I have a different opinion and it is not a nice one when I look at the people that don't like this film or understand it. But it goes something like this.Animals rights is always a topic that many people sneer at. It is a topic that many ignorant and selfish people don't give a damn about. After all, we are the dominant species and we use them for food so why shouldn't we abuse them if we feel like it? Why should we care if a whale doesn't deserve to be in captivity, why should we care if a monkey doesn't give its consent to perform experiments on it, why should we care if the way that pigs are slaughtered is something reminiscent of medieval times like in Braveheart, why should we care if a lobster feels an excrutiating amount of pain as it is being boiled live, why should we care what Bob down the street does to his German Sheppard, why should we care that sharks are being over fished just for their fins and that they are cut off and then dumped back into the ocean, still alive and left to die, why should we care that bears are caught in traps and left there for days writhing in pain before they are killed, why should we care? When we have films that are made like Orca and Free Willy and now Instinct, they are dismissed as laughable propaganda for a cause that is beneath most human beings. I read a review in the IMDb by some ignorant fool that said the reason he didn't like Orca is because the film went too far to say that whales are actually capable of revenge. Let's see, if you saw your mate strung up on a fishing boat and then your unborn baby was aborted, I'd say that no matter what species you were, you would be capable of revenge. You ever see a cat in a new home after it has been abused? Watch how it takes years before it will trust again. Animals have long memories and they will remember who did something bad to them. So when a film like Instinct gets made and people dismiss it as being silly garbage, not only are they silly themselves, but they are downright ignorant. Stupidity isn't something that you are born with, you have to learn to be stupid, and the general population is stupid if they believe that animals don't have or shouldn't have the same rights that we as humans do. I think Instinct is ahead of its time and perhaps 20 or 50 or even 100 years down the line when there are stricter laws against cruelty to animals, people can look back on a film like this and say, " You know what? Instinct was way ahead of its time. " Just like they say that Laura Secord and Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King and even someone like Oskar Schindler were ahead of their time. Remember when it was okay to call a black person a nigger? Remember when it was okay to hit your wife? Remember when it was okay to tease Jews? Remember when it was more acceptable to ostracize gays and lebians? Remember when blacks picked cotton for idiot slave owners? Remember what times were like before the Geneva Convention or The U.N. There were no laws for prisoners of war. You could treat them like you could a slave, but now there are laws against that. And if we can have laws during a war!! then why can we not have tighter laws governing the protection of animals. Laws have improved for so many but they haven't advanced one iota for in years.Instinct gives us a grueling look into our sick and sad presumption that we are allowed, that we have to right to dominate, abuse, kill, experiment on and eliminate to the point of extinction, all animals. Only when a certian species of animal begins to dwindle in numbers do we put limits on hunting of that animal. And that is sad.Instinct has a lot to say and not many people are willing to listen. It is easier to look the other way and laugh at what you see before you. The power of denial should never be underestimated. We are great at that.Instinct is the type of film that should be taken much more seriously than it is. And when people say that the title should be Silence of the Gorillas in the Shawshank Over the Cuckoo's Nest, that is ridiculous. All movies are recycled from older ideas. There are only so many stories you can tell over again. Example, Blue Streak= Beverly Hills Cop or Rush Hour, Double Jeopardy= The Fugitive or Shawshank Redemption, American Pie= Porky's, Fastimes at Ridgemont High, Last American Virgin, well you get the point. It doesn't matter that this theme has been attempted before. No one has paid attention so this theme should be recycled over and over again until someone does take it seriously enough. After all, you are talking about a life here. And our lives should not be considered any more important or precious than that of an animal.I'm sure many people think I am whacked right now, a real fruitcake. Fine, but I think I'm right and one day this film will be looked at as a step in the right direction. It may take a century before that happens, but one day there will enough of us "bleeding hearts" out there to make a difference. Until then, I'm glad that someone has the intelligence and the balls and the passion to make this type of movie. And maybe those of you that didn't like it for the reasons that I mentioned in here should watch it again. And maybe you should look at yourself in the mirror. Remember, no matter how cleverly you sneak up on a mirror your reflection always looks you straight in the eye.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know which was most offensive about this movie: the wretched 'acting' of Cuba Gooding, the appallingly inappropriate music by Danny Elfman, or the bromide-ridden script. Take GORILLAS IN THE MIST, cross it with ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, add a touch of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS,add heavy handed metaphors about Men in Jails being Like Animals In Cages, mix badly, and serve. Nothing made sense, nothing was resolved, and the only reason to go see this at all is to see Anthony Hopkins do his thing. I don't know how he kept a straight face when working with Gooding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise underlying this movie - that "civilization" is a crippling and artificial encrustation separating us from our underlying, more primitive or "natural" selves - did not begin with Annie Dillard or Abbie Hoffman, but extends at least as far back as the 18th century philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. (The fact that Rousseau's personal life was such a mess and that he behaved so reprehensibly to those closest to him should tell us something, but that's another story.)Let us look at a few of the ideas, assumptions and episodes in this altogether ridiculous movie.Dr. Powell (Hopkins) states that there is "more danger in one day in the city than in the entire jungle," a pleasant-sounding nostrum that could only be penned by a scriptwriter who has never set foot in an actual tropical jungle environment, with all its deadly hazards. I'll take Newark, N.J.Dr. Powell also states that the various primitive hunter-gatherer peoples "never, NEVER killed a single animal more than they needed." The fictional doctor's academic pursuits apparently never included a study of the Plains Indians and their well-known technique of hunting buffalo by stampeding them over cliffs and leaving them to the vultures after taking what they needed. Details, details.As far as life among the gentle gorillas, every primate study shows that the qualities of competition, greed, struggle for power, cruelty and aggression (along with, indeed, kindness, compassion, and mutual concern) are just as prevalent in primate groups as in human societies. It is never made clear just why this group of apparent soldiers is shooting at gorillas. Elephants, bears, and rhinoceros are among some of the animal species under threat from poachers; great apes are not, the primary threat to their environment being from human encroachment into their living space, not poaching. And because most African governments have passed laws protecting great apes and other endangered species (laws emanating from that nasty "civilized" legal system) soldiers would be more likely to be shooting at poachers than at gorillas. The most likely explanation for the scene is that it nicely fulfills the plot requirements. So what if it has no basis in reality? Details, details.And as far as the supposedly pernicious effects of the "civilization" the film purports to hold in contempt, perhaps the filmmakers might have considered some of its salutary effects: e.g. medical advances that have eliminated epidemic disease throughout the globe; farming advances that have increased the efficiency of food production to the point where famines are products of political conflict, not lack of food; concepts of law and justice which have eliminated the need to resolve your argument with your neighbor by bashing his head in with a rock; developments in hygiene and sanitation which have increased public health; etc. etc. etc. etc. It is a curiously liberal conceit that believes the characteristics of warfare, slavery, aggression and cruelty are unique to western culture. The supposedly saintly hunter-gatherer peoples in the word have their ample share of those characteristics. The Incas were tearing human hearts out by the dozen in ritual human sacrifice long before Cortes arrived, and the treatment accorded prisoners by some Indian tribes would have done the Inquisition proud.The only level at which the movie works is with the conflict between the therapist and the hierarchy of the high security prison, but even this is played without subtlety or intelligence.The sandal-and-brie crowd will doubtless adore this fatuous piece of New Age twaddle. However, anyone with a modicum of understanding of history, cultural anthropology, and animal behavior will be uninspired, unimpressed and unmoved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realize that many of the critics have ripped this film without mercy. In many ways they are correct. Filled with cliches, the plot has flaws. The writing is often absurd. Young Cuba Gooding reminds one of Mickey Rooney in black face. The music is something out of Titanic. Having said that, there is a certain appeal to the film that makes it almost bearable. Perhaps it is its appeal to our sense of illusion regarding our perceptions of reality...that we are not in control. Perhaps it is the fact that Hopkins deals with an inane script with a sense of compassion and understanding. But whatever, the movie will not win any awards.

		<fullReview>In my review of another Cuba Gooding Jnr movie MEN OF HONOR I mentioned the movie tries too hard to impress the Oscar board in the hope of getting a few awards . I had the exact same feeling watching this movie . Everything seems to whallop us over the head as it screams " Please Mister Academy Award person - Give us some Oscars " The story itself is one of those truimph of the human will type plots with the main character having some sort of social / psychological impediment ala RAINMAN etc with lots of sentimental scenes that on paper may have appeared touching but on screen seem rather forced , unconvincing and mawkishThere also seems to be another problem of what INSTINCT is trying to be . It`s difficult not to notice its attempt to be an awards movie but is it also trying to be something else ? Is it in fact trying to be a gritty prison drama also ? I think it might be via the sometimes brutish guards and the man mountain convict with the obsession for the ace of diamonds but this aspect makes the entire production feel confused and unfocussedI noted in the trivia section that Sean Connery turned down the role of Ethan and this was probably a good idea since he appears in far too many productions that seem ill thought out ( INSTINCT would have been no different in that respect ) but Anthony Hopkins seems a bizarre replacement. The reason Hopkins is rightly well regarded as an actor is down to one main thing - His voice . Strange that he was cast as Ethan when the character doesn`t utter a word until almost half way through the movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a heavy-handed collision of Gorillas in the Mist and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Seriously.Somewhere in the muddle is some kind of message about man's eco-place in the natural environment. Or something like that.We get Anthony Hopkins living among Gorillas (but he doesn't run into Sigourney Weaver, go figure) until he gets arrested and flown back to the US to face charges. An eager young med student named Cuba Gooding Jr is volunteered by Donald Sutherland to conduct a psych evaluation on Hopkins.Well, it takes one minute for Cuba to break through the primitive wall of silence Hopkins has constructed. And before you can say Jack Nicholson, Hopkins has the assorted criminal loons on his side. Which is supposed to be all uplifting.Skip this. Watch Cuckoo's Nest, Gorillas in the Mist and Silence of the Lambs instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even close to great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm getting a little ticked seeing some user reviews with lines like, "People who don't like this movie just don't get it, are too dumb to get it. You have to be smart and emotionally sensitive to enjoy this!" Well, a big Italian flick of the chin to all that. I'm smart enough, emotionally sensitive, and think this movie is dreck.It's a Rousseauist fantasy about the evils of civilization as contrasted with the wondrousness of gorilla life (if you think the great apes aren't violent, you're wrong. Cf, especially, chimpanzees). This morality tale is told through the character of a man who loves gorillas but can't love his own daughter. Still, he's the hero somehow.Anyway, the hero is played off of by a shrink who ends up giving us some serious schmaltz. The "Great Tearing-Up Of the Playing Cards Scene," with the swelling music was supposed to move us to tears and, for those who'd make such a gesture, perhaps fist-pumps, but ends up feeling crazily contrived. Same with the "you taught me how to live!" stuff, which simply didn't have the chemistry between the two characters or the plot build-up to make it remotely believable. And same, too, with the almost-final shot of said shrink standing in the rain with outstretched arms, face toward the Heavens in some sort of exaltation.I don't know about you, but I'm really tired of hearing the messages that man is bad, we all suck, civilization's made us insane, society forces us to live lives that are "fake" (most folks outgrow the Holden Caulfield stage of life after they turn 16 or so), and that if we lived like animals, everything would be great (go talk to some lions and gazelles about that. If you can get them into a room together, I mean.) What's funny about that line of thought is that it's typically expressed by folks who think of man as nothing but an animal anyway, just another great ape and nothing more, so they're not logically consistent on that, but whatever. The thing is, though, that even if I were to agree with the message, which I most assuredly don't, I would think this movie fails to send it effectively because of pacing, lack of chemistry, a bad script, etc. I think it could've been a good movie if it hadn't been trying to send that big message and had treated it as the story of one man with moral failures who, because of those failures and his own weaknesses, can only live happily with gorillas. That could've been interesting. But as it is, it's a 7-cheese pizza without the crust, if you know what I mean.The actors were fine, though. Anthony Hopkins is usually cool to watch, and I thought Cuba did a decent enough job with what he had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Instincts Say Avoid This Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Instinct (1999): Dir: Jon Turteltaub / Cast: Anthony Hopkins, Cuba Gooding Jr., Maura Tierney, Donald Sutherland, John Ashton: It's Hannibal Lector in Africa comparing animal instincts to that of humans. Anthony Hopkins abandons his family to study gorillas in Africa. He abandons civilization and remains among gorillas for two years until he is taken prisoner for murder. Nothing is resolved in the nitwit conclusion and it would seem unfit that anyone would choose to live in the wild as oppose to be with their family. Family situation is loosely handled and the screenplay throws in unnecessary subplots including treatment of prisoners. It isn't surprising when Hopkins nearly kills an inmate due to mind screwing by guards. Directed by Jon Turteltaub who previously made two very different and more enjoyable films in While You Were Sleeping and Phenomenon. Hopkins is basically reciting his famed Lector role, which distracts any potential message. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a flatly written psychiatrist who tries to make a difference. Maura Tierney is wasted as Hopkins's daughter who is destined to remain scratching her head at it all. Donald Sutherland is featured as a judge and that is a big reduction after all his great leading roles. More African footage would have been preferred over its blatant courtroom appeal. Trust your instincts and avoid this film. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hopkins could have remained silent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting in this movie is often so good that it makes you think you are witnessing some profound ideas and that you are going to get some mind altering revelations. In fact, this doesn't happen.What does happen is a series of clichéd scenarios about the nature of man, the bad side. There are questions raised about control, freedom and how man lives within a world of illusions. Sound familiar? These questions are raised within an environment populated by psychotics and it is depicted that murderers and other deviants are misunderstood and mistreated and that is the root of their destructive behavior. Sound familiar? The story also wants to tell us that man's brutal side is morally inferior to wild jungle beasts. Sound familiar? The story presents a lot of stock, age old questions but it never gives us any answers and you'd think some kind of coherent answers would arise since an anthropologist is the main character. This failure completely neutralizes any plot contrivances and makes everything that happens rather pointless.Hopkins' role as an edgy alienated scientist no longer able to live in the modern world is sympathetic, but the script doesn't give him the words or fully articulated concepts to make him a believable hero. He is merely a tool to drive a half-developed story. Gooding's character devolves from a really smart, compassionate psychiatrist to a weeping schoolboy whose baptism in the rain is supposed to signify something meaningful. But it's core is underwhelming, especially when you know trained psychiatrists go through transactional analysis as part of their education. The kinds of ideas he got from Hopkins should have been rudimentary for him.As others have noted, mental illness and man's imperfect dominion over this planet have been presented in more provocative ways and with more insight in other films. There is nothing new here, certainly nothing instructive. 3* for the acting, cinematography and production values that frame a quite redundant and unsatisfying story.</fullReview>

Anthony Hopkins, Cuba Gooding Jr, Donald Sutherland and George Dzundza all turn in fine performances, but due to excessive moralizing, the movie comes out kinda silly. I really recommend just reading "Ishmael" and only seeing this movie if there's absolutely nothing else to see.So, in conclusion, I will play off of a movie title to give my summation: this "Instinct" is not basic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes a wild man? Long hair. That's all the makers of this film thought they needed to do to Sir Tony to make it look like he's been living with the gorillas for 2 years. He remained remarkably portly for a chap who has eaten nothing but fruits, berries and leaves for the past 24 months. Oh, and by gorillas, I mean actors in distractingly unconvincing gorilla suits. Anthony Hopkins simply draws on past roles for his performance and shows nothing new here. I suppose it's purely a pay check performance, because he read the rest of the script and just could not be bothered to make any effort to save this load of tosh. Cuba Gooding's method of acting in this film seems just to be how many faces he can pull whilst trying to look emotional and does not carry the role of a psychologist off at all. Most of this film is just a rehash of other films like Gorillas in the Mist, One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest and any psychological drama you can think of really. Even a little bit of Shawshank Redemption thrown in at the end, but it just doesn't carry it off because it feels like film making by numbers. There is nothing in this film that will surprise you apart from the end, which is just so poor, it defies belief. ***Spoiler*** Hopkins character escapes from a maximum security prison by digging out a metal grill covering a window with a metal pen, scales 2 fences and disappears to freedom in broad daylight. Then, manages to find his way back to Africa to go back to the Gorillas, all without being so much as even glimpsed. After all, who would be looking for an insane murderous 60 year old ape-man with long white hair and a beard who has attacked policemen and prison guards in two countries? No media interest there, then. Over two hours worth of intelligence insulting nonsense. 5 out of 10. Avoid this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, this movie is truly inspirational because it made me realize that there are other people that think the way I do about the world and the whole "takers" "theory". But it ends here; because the whole Hollywood glamor, fancy production and Hollywood predictability are so unfitting to the movie they ruin it beyond repair. The scene where Ethan looses his family of gorillas should be one of the most intense and heartbreaking scenes I ever saw but it wasn't, because I just couldn't get into it as much as I could. This is because somewhere in my mind I knew exactly how the movie was going to end. Which is not necessarily a bad thing if the ending is suitable.It wasn't. It was your typical Hollywood ending.I truly hope they remake the story(and this is coming from a person who despises 95% of remakes-well, the ones that are worse than the original) , perhaps find some low-key actors for the lead roles and most importantly make the movie as real as possible. The subject "Instinct" deals with is probably one of the most important things a person realizes(if he even does) and should not be handed into the hands of incompetent or unsuitable directors. The subject of this movie is finding true meaning of life, finding and discovering how it works, finding you inner self, you primal instincts and discovering that the real world will never be a place we'd want it to be. I'm putting even myself down now, let me rephrase that, the real world can be a great place to live in if you accept certain rules and to some extent do become trapped in your own little illusion. It is a world where Ethan Powell would never stand a chance of surviving or escaping. It is a world where all the Ethan Powells would perish. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More or less, the only film with Sigourney Weaver which I rather liked was "Gorillas in the Mist". The fact that "Instinct" seems to copy several scenes from Ms. Weaver's film, obviously does not count in its favour. I usually like Anthony Hopkins in his films, but this one must have been for the pay-packet. In several scenes, when he was with the gorillas in the jungle - with or without mist - I was watching retakes of Dian Fossey in Sigourney Weaver's earlier production, and which, I must add, is far better than this film. The attitude and postures adopted by Hopkins with the gorillas are carbon-copies, pure plagiarism. The fact that Cuba Gooding in one of his dialogues even mentions Sigourney Weaver by name is, whether those responsible for the copy-cat version like it or not, a nod in the direction of recognising what was evidently the better story and better film. Shame on Messrs. Gooding and Hopkins for making such a silly regurgitation with unconvincing story to boot.</fullReview>

Cuba Gooding Jr. is not convincing at all as Dr. Theo Calder.The story is that Hopkins character is so fascinated with the gorillas of Rwanda that he starts to live among them and slowly fading into their rules, norms and behavior. One day the hunters come.It's the same old I think really from the American movie industry. The same clichés when it comes to psychology and it's just too plain. A film like this needs depth and this one doesn't have it. For a moment there I almost thought it was heading to hell with a brief, small and neat little romance as well, but it didn't.

		<fullReview>The anthropologist kills some Rangers in Africa, and unlikely as it might be is returned to America to stand trial. He is mute so he needs a psychiatric evaluation. The next unlikely event is his evaluation being done by a resident instead of someone with much experience. However, this resident is superior and can do it. The prisoner is not treated that well, especially by the chief guard, and the prison has a psychotic section of all things. The resident gets on the wrong side of the Warden quickly, but the prison psychiatrist goes from negative to positive after the resident insults him. The major flaw is that no lawyer seems to exist which would have changed the plot entirely since much that happens would have been changed by the prisoner having a lawyer. The resident discovers why he killed the rangers and the audience is probably sympathetic. However, he escapes, from a maximum security prison no less, with a little help from a couple of nice psychotics, and returns to the jungle. Unusual and unlikely plot, but good acting. No real psychiatric depth. At the beginning we see the psychiatric resident confronting a person with a delusion which isn't the way it is done, but in this instance the woman starts to doubt her delusion.

In addition, the plight of mental patients was touched on, but this has nothing like the conviction shown for the need for change, as illustrated in One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest. The acting from Gooding and Hopkins, is as you would expect, superb, and the films main strength revolves around their interaction.The story itself is bland and unbelievable, Hopkins seems to develop the strength and agility of a young gorilla, despite being an old and frail man. After two years living in the jungle without any supplies/tools, and a year in an African prison, there is no way that this is correct.I guess I need to lose more illusions, in order to treat this film as anything other than a way to while away a couple of hours....RIP Stanley Kubrick, you are sorely missed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whatever you think about its message (which is trite for all except 15 year olds), Instinct is a formulaic and completely unbelievable product. Cuba Gooding looks and acts more like a Wall Street banker than a psychiatrist. His acting is far too intense for him to be believable as an inquisitive physician. His approach to his patient is often inappropriate and ineffective (I'm a physician, and my wife is a psychiatrist). Did anyone involved in this film's production do their homework here?The movie is completely predictable at every turn. All the Hollywood stereotypes are used, including the inflexible, aging prison warden, the brutal correction officers, and the wacky yet endearing "insane" prisoners. Anthony Hopkins' moments of outburst and violence never surprise. Even the music is formulaic with its sweeping, dramatic touches.Worst of all, the character development seems to move without logical progression. Incredibly, in one or two interviews Gooding's not-to-convincing shrink is able to wrestle Hopkins from his mute shell. In one scene, Hopkins is a shaggy, ornery, and unpredictable animal, and then within 15 minutes he's drawing sophisticated world maps on his prison cell wall and philosophizing about mankind's arrogance.The message of the movie is irrelevant if it can't deliver it within a convincing story! If I wanted ONLY the message I could re-read a few of my high school newspaper's editorials.</fullReview>

It seems almost impossible that I have seen the same film. Not once does the story ring true, the dialogue is silly at best(e.g. the "Sigourney Weaver"-one-liner, which is funny, but seems totally out of place)and, come on, how moralizing can one film be? All this is presented with a mushy Danny Elfman score and several useless subplots. The end shot is ridiculous, the romantic subplot is unbelievable, Donald Sutherland's character could have easily been left out and why not focus more on the relationship between the two doctors, instead of presenting a wide variety of "Cuckoo's nest" characters?I gave this film a "4", but God knows I've been very generous.

		<shortDescription>Redemption of the Shawshank gorillas in the mist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Instinct- Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins), an American primatologist, sits in jail Rwanda for the murder of two park rangers. In his years in confinement, he has never uttered a word to explain what happened. Powell is suddenly turned over to the custody of the US State Department and sent back home. Once there, he is sent to the psychiatric ward of a prison which is woefully understaffed and brutal.Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr). is the hotshot young psychiatrist from Powell's old Alma Mater who is determined to break through to him and find out what happened.I have enjoyed Hopkins' work since his portrayal as Hannibal Lector and he was my main reason for seeing this movie. In spite of the script, Hopkins delivers a convincing performance, and is at his best when talking in hushed tones. Cuba Gooding Jr. is also hobbled by bad dialogue and is simply not believable as a psychiatrist. However, I did like his transformation from cocky know-it-all to "innocent".The main problem with the movie was Dipego's screenplay - he could not decide where he wanted to go, so he employed the shotgun effect to cover every angle and failed miserably. The extreme brutality of the prison guards was so over the top that it simply was unbelievable, and contributed nothing to the story. Powell's time in Rwanda, specifically when his daughter was with him should have been explored more in depth (especially since this is a central theme in his "rehabilitation").Finally, I can say without hyperbole that this is the worst score I have ever heard: it was overblown, loud, too melodramatic and distracted me from the movie.If you are intrigued by the themes in this movie, rent Gorillas in the Mist, The Shawshank Redemption, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, or Midnight Express for a solid treatment of the subjects. Instinct tries for an amalgamation and falls far short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a five cent theme. While it isn't horrible to the point of being unwatchable, then it moves very slowly, and by the time you get to see the point of the entire ordeal, the message is so cheesy, cliche, and "feel good" that you want to bury your head in your hands. (I did, anyway.) Also, when a movie is labeled as a thriller, shouldn't it be, umm, thrilling? Truthfully, the only "thrills" offered in this flick are the sudden loud noise made when Hopkins pounds his fists on the table. The only character who wasn't making me blanch repeatedly by the end of the film was Maura Teriney, whose character, while given to the occasionally sappy scene, didn't sink to the level of absolute cheese all of the other (cartoon) characters in this movie were given to constantly. This is disappointing because the premise for this movie wasn't bad. It's execution, however, is horrible, resulting in a boring, clunky film that's basically a life-action version of Bambi In the Cukoo's Nest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me get this straight; I'm supposed to believe that a man studying gorillas in the wild (Anthony Hopkins) just decides, out of the clear blue sky, to become a gorilla. This movie was flawed from the start. There was no suspense whatsoever. To replace this Anthony Hopkins would slam his fists into the table every now and then. At least that woke everybody up. I also noticed that every character in that phony mental ward was based on a character in "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest." I don't understand why Cuba Gooding Jr. was getting emotional at the end of the movie when there was no established relationship between him and gorilla man anyway. All Hopkins did was beat him up all the time. Donald Sutherland gives another mediocre, predictable performance. Cuba never should have chosen this role and Anthony Hopkins should quit trying to play the same character all the time like he did in that overrated movie "Silence of The Lambs." I'm really tired of Hollywood putting out the same predictable garbage all the time.</fullReview>

Cuba Gooding Jr 's acting is unbelievably bad and corny. It is made worse by the poor script which showed him making some mistakes during the sessions that even layman wouldn't made. The plot was so predictable that I thought there must be something more to it when it was revealed. Sadly, there was none beyond that point.

A lot of talent and energy has been expended on a film that's just loaded with cheese. Each time I thought they were on to something, the writer went for the easy out. Anthony Hopkins does some wonderful body work as a zoologist who lives among the gorillas for two years. Cuba Gooding, Jr. does a beautiful job with dreadfully written monologue at the end. Maura Tierney is terrific. But one scene was such an obvious lift from "Cuckoo's Nest" I'm surprised Ken Kesey didn't ask for "inspired by" billing. And towards the end, I was evaluating each new plot development in terms of how much it would add to the film's box office. Overall prediction: it will break even at the very least thanks to ancillary markets, and Hopkins could snare a Golden Globe nomination, but it will hardly go down in film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ethan Powell (Antony Hopkins) is deported back to a US mental facility after his scientific work in Africa ends in a murder conviction. There he builds a wall of silence that needs to be broken down by new-boy shrink Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr).The central problem with worthy topics is that, while I salute their seriousness and gravity, that doesn't mean I automatically enjoy any product that wants to wrap itself in it. This film (a why-dun-nit) takes a small age to say anything or go anywhere and even when it does it is clearly a hodgepodge of other films best bits.(Let us not bother mentioning them again!)Hopkins is a fine actor and wonderfully intense - but wasted in this chewing-the-curtains epic. Yes, the prison system is wrong, but what should a prison for the criminal mentally-unstable look like? The Ritz? Equally here in the affluent West it is easy to sit back and condemn those living an uneducated hand-to-mouth existence in some jungle clearing.(Doesn't make them right though!) To be frank I was totally bored before the movie had reached the half way point and - by which point it had said everything it had to say and show - and I was hoping for the thing to finish as quickly as possible.Hollywood is part of most of the problems of this world (grab it, take it, snort it, ignore the safety of bystanders, solve-it -by-violence night-after-night) so when it gets preachy my ears tend to close. For the record the message is right - the medium is wrong. Thrillers have to thrill - this doesn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if this saying is an original or if I just heard it somewhere else and it struck a chord with me, but it is a phrase that quite fittingly describes "Instinct"--"a film so syrupy, you could pour it on your pancakes." Loosely based on Daniel Quinn's novel "Ishmael," the movie follows a young upstart psychiatrist (Cuba Gooding, Jr., in full-on weepy 'Oscar Consideration' mode) attempting to find out why an esteemed anthropologist (Anthony Hopkins) decided to live among apes in Africa, and the murders he perpetrated as a result. Quinn's novel was a cautionary tale about the threat mankind poses to itself as communicated by the preachy title gorilla and greased with a lot of moralistic ballast (it's a weighty book in more ways than one); "Instinct," while rife with potential for exploring any of the novel's themes, barely skims the surface (save for a few calculated moments designed to make audiences weep and cheer), and what remains is an overly sentimental drama riddled with clichés (from the cartoonish perspective on mental illness to Hopkins reconciling with his estranged daughter). Though I guess this is how "Ishmael" would translate to a mainstream Hollywood production: cut out the food for thought, insert a lot of manipulative uplift, and send everyone home happy. While Hopkins gamely immerses himself a savage role, his character seems underdeveloped, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. as the overly giddy shrink, hardly seems his equal; in spite of its 2-hour run time, a lot of "Instinct" feels squandered on the requisite crowd-pleasing moments, which steers it further from intellectual possibility. Director Jon Turteltaub, associated mostly with lighter fare ("Cool Runnings"; "3 Ninjas"; "While You Were Sleeping"), guides the production with an overly sentimental hand (the final 'farewell' between Hopkins and Gooding, Jr. was trying my patience), thus rendering the material impotent and unconvincing. (An unusually nondescript Danny Elfman score doesn't help, either.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so pumped when I heard that a movie was going to be created based on ideas of the book Ishmael. As an avid reader of Daniel Quinn novels, I though this movie sucked. It probably doesn't deserved a four rating, but am giving it that because it did a terrible job of exploring Quinn's ideas. It really did no exploring at all, and just put a fingernail scratch on the surface of the ideas discovered in Ishmael. It took about 45 minutes for the movie to even start to talk about some of the little aspects of Quinn's new world vision. The movie talks alittle about the idea of takers and givers from the novel; and thats about it. Read the book Ishmael and other novels by Quinn to have a life changing experience. Skip the movie. Or read the book first and watch this movie after; then you will realize how bad Instinct really is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm having trouble believing all the positive comments that this film is pulling down. From its cliched and plagiaristic script, to its heavy-handed, obvious, "here's how you should feel now" score, to the flat direction &amp; cinematography (when I first saw it on TV, I was convinced I was watching some made-for-tv CBS "Movie of the Week" until you get to see Hopkins). The only thing it has going for it was the competent performances put in by the principles (Hopkins, Gooding, Sutherland), but the roles they were portraying were the most generic stereotypes going, so it was somewhat in vain.What's to hate? How about the way the movie creates cartoon-evil prison just so Gooding &amp; Hopkins can have an "enemy" to fight against for some phony conflict. How about the way the "incompetent" prison therapist gets to have a redemption halfway through the film (resulting in not only his personality changing, but his hair suddenly becomes neatly groomed), which leaves the movie without a villain. What to do? Create a new one by passing the buck to the warden &amp; chief guard. Dialogue as obvious &amp; predictable as a nursery rhyme (the second Hopkins asks Gooding "what have I taken from you?", I knew Gooding would get three guesses and I knew they would be "Control", "Freedom" and "My Illusions"). How about the cheesy gorilla-suited actors - the baby gorilla, which was already pretty suspect due to the puppet-like way it moved it's head (it looked like Yoda), becomes preposterous when it does its all-too-human "reach out the hand" gesture as Hopkins is fighting the killers.Overall, the movie seems like something that was written, directed &amp; acted on autopilot.</fullReview>

It starts out decently, although Gooding Jr. churns the stomach with his attempt to play an ambitious psychiatrist (for he convinces on no levels whatsoever), and Hopkins trying to suggest emotion and drama where none exists. Still, after half an hour it promises to be entertaining nonsense, but slowly you realize you have already seen this film at least twice (Gorilla's in the mist, One flew over the CN) and it doesn't dare to make at least one decent statement. For example: Hopkins' character Powell calls the civilized men TAKERS (straight faced): isn't it pathetic??? But what's really terrifying is that you keep thinking all this dire mess could have worked better as a straight comedy, and if that's not an indication of how bad it is, I don't know what is. *(out of five)</fullReview>

I'm not exaggerating - there were so many overt film references it seemed like a parody. The actors were designated by their collective wallet, not heart or mind, and the direction was simplistic. And you people gave 'Julien Donkey-Boy' a 4.5? Clearly the lesson remains: 'give us what we want' because the alternative is just too horrifying.It's this type of film, and this type of rampant commercialism that seeks to destroy the craft of film art, just as disco had to rock and roll in the 70s.

		<fullReview>I knew nothing about this movie before I went to see it and thought it was a waste of 51 francs and two fine actors. As many previous comments have mentioned, it's Silence of the Lambs meets The Shawshank Redemption meets all those other films about an idealist who goes into a horrible prison or high school and tries to change it. Don't waste your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a terrible movie, so horribly transparent in it's motives, and so melodramatic and over acted. It's a Hallmark card telling us of the inherent evils of mankind. I wouldn't recommend this at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an attempt to marry "Gorillas in the mist" with "one flew over the cukoos nest" - It is vastly inferior to both, cliche ridden and with a very silly ending indeed.Hopkins is servicible in this role while Goodings shows yet again that "boys'n the hood" is the only film he's made where he is bearable to watch.Avoid...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>shamefully bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a free preview last week, and this movie is so pathetically and utterly horrible that I signed up as an IMdB user for the sole purpose of adding my comment to the incomprehensible raves for this tedious badly-written formulaic piece of crap. Poor Anthony Hopkins. Poor Cuba Gooding, Jr. By the end of this predictable film, I would swear that the obligatory tear rolling down each actor's face in the "seious bonding" moment is a tear of shame for being forced to mouth lines like "You taught me how to feel" etc ad nauseum. Yuck, yuck, yuck -- do not waste a penny to see this. The premise of a man living among gorillas is fascinating; too bad the dramatic structure of the story lost any native interesting moments by being mostly composed of gauzy flashbacks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gorillas in the Mist meets Silence of the Lambs? I couldn't believe it either, but this is one of those special films...It's clear from the start that Instinct thinks it's much more intelligent than it actually is. Sadly, it doesn't even redeem itself by being unintentionally funny.I know little of evolution and virtually nothing about psychiatry, yet the borderline unethical errors* showcased in this film tell me that I'm more clued up than the authors, who also demonstrate laughable comprehension of photography and border control in the 21st Century...and then there's the script. That Donald Sutherland can recite such atrocities with a straight face is testament to his ability as an actor.It's as if the writers had come home from a conversation with a deeply spiritual person (with very reasonable rates) feeling inspired with a message they simply had to communicate to the rest of the world. It seems that we are free spirits, born into cages we can't see past. I'm glad the good people of Hollywood revealed that to us in their own inimitable fashion.*"Ah, that man appears to have wet himself. In that case, I think I'll devote my professional compassion to somebody who doesn't smell of urine."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stolen Illusions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything here is stolen, mostly from the movies; there is an attempt at a Ishmael/Ahab/whale dynamic.Hopkins preaches to us in a "Medicine Man" get up. The two stories are told by force of his 'Lecter' persona passing through "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", "Birdy" and "Shawshank Redemption", and in parallel, "Farewell to the King" and "Gorillas in the Mist"(mercifully, Turteltaub assumes we've already seen the latter).The big illusion is that the 'choice we all face' is to either become a self-flagellating dipstick, or a 'taker'.I could at least respect this if every actor who contracted seven plus figures for his work here donated his paycheck to protect wildlife. Somehow, I don't think that actually happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the biggest steaming pile of a movie I've seen in a long time. Awful writing, awful directing, tedious and contrived plot, and poor acting efforts from an A-list cast. In fact, this is one of those movies that's hard to turn away from because the awfulness is so compelling -- this is a movie with serious Oscar pretensions that comes up short in so many ways. The plot can be more or less summed up as a melodramatic mix of the worst parts of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest &amp; Gorillas in the Mist. Man loves Gorillas, Gorillas get killed, man goes berserk (this is the big secret he's keeping mute over in the nuthouse?) Hopkins wades through the dreadful script as well as possible, but Gooding as usual hams it up to the max all movie long with his favorite screwed-up-Popeye-indignant face. A couple of choice scenes to demonstrate the cheeziness of this movie -- First, the scene in which Gooding gets all the inmates to tear up their playing cards while the inspirational music swells and you half-expect the cast to start the slow-unison clap from those awful highschool sports movies. Second, when Gooding gets out of his car in the end after quitting the asylum, he climbs out of the car and with more sappy music swelling does the Tim Robbins Shawshank-escape Jesus pose in the driving rain... unbelievable syrupy tripe. Don't waste your time with this stinker, unless you like the unique awfulness of the Heaven's Gate-type of train-wrecks; you're better off jabbing a salad fork in your eye for 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Instinct" (1999)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this film two years ago, yet it is more vivid in my memory than some I have seen quite recently, because it was so incredibly irritating. A hoary-headed Anthony Hopkins, the length of whose tangled locks and bodily strength equal those of Samson, demonstrates the contrasting abilities of living au pair with the gorillas in the jungle like Dr Doolittle and later escaping from a high-security nut-house with the aid of a ball-point pen (why didn't he use a paper clip to disguise at least this particular plagiarism?). The other examples of plagiarism have been adequately dealt with by earlier commentators; there are so many of them, that it is a wonder somebody didn't sue. But the recycling, or perhaps more appropriately, "cannibalization" of so many good movies did not combine their virtues, but rather produced an unlovely Frankenstein's monster of a film. I can only imagine that the indubitably talented Hopkins desperately needed to meet some financial emergency. What Gooding's and Sutherland's excuses are, I know not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>possibly the worst movie i have ever seen (small SPOILER)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>uuuggghhhh!!! so so bad. for anthony hopkins it's a bad hannibal lector reprisal. for cuba its...i don't even know, but it's bad. my friends and i laughed through the whole thing, and this movie wasn't supposed to be funny. my favorite part is when cuba is standing in the rain with his arms raised high in that "why God why?" expression. i have never seen such ridiculous melodrama. i really really wanted the gorillas to escape and wipe out all the main characters. then it could turn into a funny planet of the apes sequel. uuugghhh!!! i get shivers of displeasure just thinking about this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Wish I Had The Instinct Not To Go See This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why did I listen to my sister. I'm not a Cuba Gooding fan at all. The last movie was Boyz In The Hood. But I thought, as did my sister, that the movie was going to be a thriller, you know something scary....WRONG...more like something boring. After 30 mins of nothingliness, empty dialogue and a few sudden moves by Hopkins I was asking myself when will the drama happen. I wouldn't have mine if the trailers had been honest. They showed a movie that looked like it was going to be suspenseful. Not about one man discovering his true instinct (Gooding) and another man mourning the lost of his gorilla family. Give me a break. First the relationship between Gooding and the daughter...either they were going to get it on or not, don't play with it. I just couldn't relate to the humanizing of apes (such environmentalist melodrama). Last, but not least, what was up with the feeling of rain on Goodings face at the end...I was like, Oh PALEEZE spare me the cheese. I'm sorry I just hated this movie. But one of my sisters liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible movie - Liberal Do-gooder Piece of Schlock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could have been OK but Cuba Gooding's portrayal of the overly earnest shrink ruined it.Anthony Hopkins is interesting as a primatologist who lived with gorillas for a couple of years and then was sent to prison for killing poachers. Gooding visits him in prison to try to find out what happened even though it's none of his business. Gooding portrays the shrink as a noble man fighting the good fight against the neaderthal prison guards and warden. It's so heavy-handed it makes you sick.Way too much sitting around and talking in this flick. Movie should have been about Hopkin's life with the gorillas, not the boring prison meetings with the shrink.Ending is pathetic. Hopkins just removes a window in front of everybody and walks away and they never find him!</fullReview>
