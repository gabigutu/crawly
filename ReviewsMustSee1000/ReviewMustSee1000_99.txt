		<shortDescription>Was honestly expecting more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie, no doubt about it. But given the combination of golden globe, Oscar buzz and positive feedback on IMDb, I expected much more.The story and the premise of the movie is perfect. In fact, the tagline caught my attention enormously: "trying to reconnect with daughters." That is exactly the type of movie I like. Instantly, I could tell this was a movie about character development and human connection, usually the type of movies with the greatest potential.Unfortunately, it was merely decent, but not special. It felt like the movie built up so much potential, but failed to release it at a certain point during the movie. The whole movie, for me, felt too introductory in nature. Not necessarily the plot, because the plot does evolve, but the overall "feel" of the movie felt preliminary to a bigger and more dramatic event which never happened.It's not easy to explain my feelings towards the movie because the fault wasn't necessarily technical or specific. But it did linger around and distracted my viewing somewhat. I felt like there was still more to explore in both Clooney's character and the character of his daughters. Also, I think this element alone impacted on Clooney's performance. His performance was good, definitely, but again, because I felt like there was more to be explored, naturally, I also felt like his performance could have been added to (but not necessarily improved).Given the Oscar buzz of this movie, I have to compare it to other movies of a similar nature. And unfortunately, I didn't feel like there was sufficient connection between the characters...although the potential to reach that connection was established, it was not acted upon in my opinion. Unfortunately I have to say there have been better developed "re-establishing connection" movies.In summary, this is an enjoyable movie, but it is missing some important elements which deteriorates the viewing experience to some extent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Descendants is not a movie that's easily defined. In the macro view, it's about a man grieving for his wife, who lies in a coma from which she may never emerge, while simultaneously attempting to care for his two rambunctious daughters, each of whom is nearly alien to the workaholic man. But don't hastily dismiss this as a tearjerker about some guy coming to grips with mortality and/or learning a little something about himself along the way. This is a movie that runs the gamut of emotions, with pristine sincerity, grace, dignity, and rich realism.Matt King (George Clooney) is the workaholic, a lawyer who lives in Hawaii. He has a good life - at least until his thrill-seeking wife suffers a serious head injury during a powerboat race, placing her in a deep coma. Matt's orderly life is no more. He must not only deal with the fact that he may never speak with his wife again, he must also learn an entirely new way of life - one with a domestic tinge. As wife Elizabeth's condition deteriorates, Matt must also deal with family and friends and open doors he never knew existed. All right, that's sort of cryptic, so let me give you this tidbit that is in no way a secret in the plot - Elizabeth, Matt shortly discovers, was having an affair at the time of her accident. On top of all of that stress and drama, Matt is the sole trustee of a huge plot of land that has been a part of his family for a very, very long time. He and his cousins have decided to field offers for the land, because the trust becomes dissolved in seven short years. Should they sell to the highest bidder or to a local businessman? Either outcome would leave all of them very rich indeed. The sale of the land will make a huge impact on the island, as it could transform what many see as a beautiful, nearly untouched mark of beauty into a symbol of avarice and decadence.The core of the entire story is Clooney's unbelievably terrific performance; he is vulnerable, strong, confused, decisive, anguished, angry. It's not every actor who can pull off such a wide range of expression, and Clooney is so effective in this movie that you sincerely feel as if you are standing directly in his shoes, seeing all from his perspective rather than just through his eyes. To say that Clooney's Matt is troubled is an understatement, but what makes this performance so remarkable to me is that at no time does he have all of the answers, and at no time does he have no answers at all. He is, to put it another way, us. The tremendous amount of pressure under which Matt finds himself is exacerbated by his daughters' behavior; partly their reaction to their mother's plight but also because, well, they're precocious and self- absorbed, as most kids are when they're teens or preteens. Add in Matt's cluelessness about how to take care of girls; then you have a real recipe for a wacky sitcom, don't you? Only here it's as real as it gets. First there's 10 year old Scotti (newcomer Amara Miller), who acts out in class - including bringing in pictures of her comatose mother for show and tell. Scotti seems like a girl who just hasn't had enough of a male influence in her short life; you get the impression that Mom was the one who took care of the kids while Dad worked and worked. As a result, Scotti is combining typical rebellious behavior with confusion on how she should feel about her mother's being in a coma. Then there's Alexandra, currently away at boarding school; for her, you get the clear impression that she's a real problem child who's used to being shunted from school to school, like a queen of diamonds in a marked-up deck. She's away when the accident occurs; Matt retrieves her (discovering she's as wild as always) and necessarily leans on her to help him deal with his various problems.Rest assured, there are moments that will jerk tears from you. However, director Alexander Payne does an amazing job of keeping everything level. This isn't a four-hankie movie, because life isn't a four-hankie movie. Life has its terrible moments and its joyous ones, too, and this film emulates that layer of authenticity to really deliver an emotionally powerful, provocative, and endearing story. This isn't a movie you can just grab the kids and some popcorn and be lightly entertained, but it's also not a Think Hard movie. It's somewhere in the middle - again, much like life. Payne and cowriters Nat Faxon and Jim Rash allow us to become psychologically engaged with everything concerning Matt and his family. We're with him so much that when he makes a blunder, we think to ourselves that we'd probably make the same blunder. It's a pleasure to see a movie in which the protagonist clearly doesn't have all of the answers, even to the easy questions, but has some answers to the hard ones. And that's why this is a hard movie to pigeonhole, and it's also why it's such a beautiful, artful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally hollow and, even worse, boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a bust. The premise is simple?unbelievably simple, given the length of the movie: a man's wife goes into a coma as the result of a boating accident and he learns, via one of his daughters, that she was having an affair. There's more to it, of course, but nothing interesting: e.g., Clooney in voice-over tells us he's "the back up parent," so we see a few scenes of him failing at being "Mr. Mom" and a few scenes of him fighting with his eldest daughter. Yet, remarkably, a half-hour into the movie the entire family is getting along so well that they all troop off to a different Hawaiian island in search of the mystery man Mom was having the affair with, with the oldest daughter even playing a lead detective role.What unfolds is hour upon hour of the family walking on beaches, driving down roads, etc., all of which culminates in a kitchen scene where Clooney confronts the man, played by Matt Lillard, about the affair. Lillard, whose acting has not deepened from his Scooby-Doo days, ensures that the scene has no dramatic impact. Then it's back to the hospital to watch Mom die.The script is unbelievably flat-footed; its idea of humor is having children shout profanity at each other. (I'm no prude?-but I'm not 12, either.) There's even an odd disconnect to the more "dramatic" scenes. Because we've never seen anyone interact with Mom?she's just a corpse, lying there?we have no way of judging the believability of anyone's reaction to her death. We're simply bludgeoned by the musical score into accepting that any given scene is sad. The movie operates on a simple syllogism: the characters are crying, so you should too.Still, judging by the audience's reaction, this movie will be a major success. I'm enough of an adult to admit when I'm odd-man-out. At each curse word, the audience roared with laughter; for each tear-jerker scene, the waterworks flowed. The Hawaiian landscape is beautifully shot, and the Hawaiian music is lovely, too. Unfortunately, I didn't pay $9.50 for a travelogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that you do NOT want to end...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director of this movie, Alexander Payne, was the guy who made "Sideways." This is a very different movie in that it focuses on family relationships rather than those between friends and lovers. But, Payne displays--in this touching and very real movie--the same incredible talent for doing two things better than almost every other movie maker (at least as far as I'm concerned): 1) he brings the viewer into the geography and milieu of the time and place in a gritty way that clearly presents the natural beauty of the area without over-romanticizing it and 2) he fits the characters into this environment and achieves a reality for these people that transcends the 2-dimensional characters that populate the multiplexes. You really care about these people.Another similarity between the characters in "Sideways" and this movie is that the protagonists are, in at least one important way, lost. They both are also honest with themselves.And thank God Payne did not use an orchestra for the soundtrack that would foreshadow and punctuate the scenes telling us how our emotions should run...I will not tell you what the soundtrack is, other than to say it's perfect.This is not a comedy though there are a few laugh lines. Clooney will get the Oscar for this...how can he not? He is in every scene, and I cannot imagine him being better. And Shailene Woodley plays his older daughter: just amazing. A beautifully realized character.I tried carefully here to give nothing away but to encourage you to see this as soon as you can. Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Descendants is an outstanding and touching drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants is a tragic and heartfelt family drama set against a backdrop of the sights and sounds of modern Hawaii. The music is wonderful, and the scenery of several Hawaiian islands is amazing.George Clooney is outstanding as the father of a family torn apart by tragedy. His character deals with unsettling secrets of his dying wife and his broken relationships with his two troubled daughters. Forced to deal with the consequences of neglecting his family, Clooney does a great job capturing conflicting and powerful emotions.Shailone Woodley does a wonderful job as the rebellious older daughter, who captures the anger and hurt of a teenager betrayed by her mother and abandoned by her father. Her relationship with her father is the heart of the movie, and they slowly learn to rely on each other for support and strength in dealing with the loss of their mother/wife.The film has a wonderful supporting cast that adds humanity and heart to the tragic story. Nick Krause stands out as the oldest daughter's friend, who adds a touch of laughter and perspective to the film. His open and carefree personality grates on the characters initially but helps them to eventually gain perspective on the tragic events.Overall, the Descendants was an excellent movie that captures the raw emotions of a family dealing with betrayal, pain, and loss and learning to draw together for love and support.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Competent all around, arguably a winning product for 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't seen so many elderly folks in a movie theatre, since I saw The King's Speech last year. I suppose there is a bit of irony in considering that a film called the Descendants has an audience of ancestors.The best thing about the movie however, is that I think it can be appreciated greatly by any adult age group, elder or not. There are laughs to be had and tears to be shed. The film centres around middle aged, Matt King; a Hawaiian land baron attempting to connect with his children with the knowledge that his comatose wife is at death's doorstep, and he knows that she had an affair before her accident. Meanwhile, he is under pressure from his network of cousins to sell his inherited land to the kind of real estate that wants to put up a seaside condo-mania. In essence, it's a recovery story. The formula is not entirely 'new' yet the somewhat paradoxical balance of refinement and dry humour are enough to elevate this to a very well rounded story. As far as drama comedies go, The Descendants is ideal.This may be George Clooney's best lead performance to date. I think it is the first role that doesn't require him to be slick or charismatic even for a moment. He is rather scruffy, but more importantly, he is human. Clooney brings range to the role, hitting all the right notes, funny and serious alike.I like the fact that even though we are on Hawaii (a photographer's paradise) the island doesn't look all that special. It's important that The islands look just as mundane to the audience as it would to the characters who inhabitant it. Most of the time it's cloudy, and low brow, except for the few moments where it is necessary to bring out the sunshine, as we stand on a cliffs edge with the King family overlooking dozens of acres of land which could very soon become merchandise.Another thing I like about the Descendents (which you don't see often) is an ending that is both happy and sad. Some say that great films are the ones that leave you wanting more. The Descendants did this to me, and it's probably the closest thing to a great film I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Payne knows exactly what he's doing, and what he's doing is tremendous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne hasn't made a film from the director's chair since his incredible Sideways back in 2004. Seven years later, he finally returns, and with The Descendants, he returns with a bang.Like Sideways, his screenplay (co-written by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash) nails the tone right on the head. It has to balance out three tricky narratives in the film (Matt King's self-crisis, his comatose wife's affair with another man before her boating accident, and a land deal he's reported to make), and without the proper guidance it needed, along with Payne's own confidant direction, it could have faltered. Thankfully, it balances out heavy themes and complicated emotions in uncommon detail.The characters in this movie are many, complicated, and sorrowful in their own unique ways. Matt King was a perfect role for George Clooney. He keeps his composure, but we can still see a very heavy, filtered sorrow beneath the surface. Shailene Woodley's character (Woodley, by the way, gives one of the year's best performances) begins with a rebellious, even angry sadness, but we can see her develop over the course of the film, gaining a strong maturity beyond her years. Judy Greer and Robert Forster are each given a few spare scenes, and they make every second of their screen time count.It really is an emotional ride, even depressing sometimes, but I'm surprised by the occasional review I read where critics say they didn't feel the emotion to be sincere. In my opinion, the emotions of the film never hit a single false note. I don't think just anybody could have made this movie the way it is. This isn't a typical drama, the movie's genre is Payne, and he knows exactly what he's doing.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the freedom oozing from Alexander Payne's films. The clarity and simplicity of the idea and its execution. All the answers and unity found under a grieving cloud. George Clooney's Matt King is, quite simply, superb. The humanity of the man mingling with his contradictions. So refreshing to spend time with this immediately recognizable man. I couldn't help but loving him. If it's true that Clooney dominates the film, he is surrounded by compelling characters. His eldest daughter, played by the remarkable Shailene Woodley for instance or her boyfriend, a winning Nick Krause, contribute to make "The Descendants" one of the best films of 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The rare fuse of amazing direction and brilliant performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been quite some time since the Toronto International Film Festival, but I still have trouble coming up with something negative to say about The Descendants. It was a film I was immensely excited to see, and one that I think I just managed to squeak into on the second last day of the festival. I tried to not overhype myself, but with George Clooney teaming up with Alexander Payne, a filmmaker whose last film was made almost a decade ago, I could barely contain myself.Matt King (Clooney) just found out that his wife is in a coma in the hospital. Matt has always been one to put things off, and has never really found time for his kids. But in this time of need, he finds that he is struggling to identify with older daughter Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) and younger daughter Scottie (Amara Miller). When he learns of a stunning secret about his wife, it thrusts him into an adventure alongside his daughters to find out the truth, while also finding himself. From beginning to end, Payne has crafted an endearing film that is hilarious and devastating, often in the same sequence. This is a more calculated family-related effort than I originally thought it would be (with a bit too much emphasis placed on the extended family and land owning subplot), but it is the driving force of everything that happens on-screen. He never overindulges, and never gets too far ahead of himself. He lets the drama play out just as much as he does the comedy, and always keeps the film moving at a borderline ridiculous pace. This may be an indie, but it speaks more to the mainstream than Sideways ever even tried to. It is a truly spectacular work, and one that proves the worth of a talent that has been gone for far too long.While he already solidified his leading man status years ago, Clooney quite simply knocks this one out of the park. It is not the typical role we are accustomed to seeing him in, and I think that is what sells it the most. This is a very mature role for Clooney, away from the playboys, the lotharios and the screwballs. He is out of his element, much like the character he is playing, thrust into a situation he never expected in a very adult way. He plays Matt in a very nuanced way, always hovering along the fine line of being a struggling parent and having a full blown emotional breakdown. Clooney has continually proved that he is willing to reinvent himself, and his work here is no different. From the moment he steps on-screen, you are simply enamoured by his presence. We can see the brief twinkle in his eye that suggests he is still the Clooney we all know and adore, but his hardened exterior suggests he is trying to camouflage that fact. I said years ago that Up in the Air was his strongest work. But his work here makes it look positively amateur in comparison.For all of Clooney's brilliance, it is surprising to note that Woodley almost steals the movie entirely away from him. While she has had quite a lot of experience on television, this is her first real film role and is an immeasurable breakout. The trailer suggests she is a bit of a wild child, but seeing the heartbreak and pain in her face after she finds out what has happened to her mother is enough to make you want to weep uncontrollably. Lucky for her, she gets more than one scene to prove her emotional chops, and she nails each and every one. She holds her own against Clooney, and has just the right amount of charisma and angst to make her character above and beyond believable. Her struggle to find her place and to help her father on this adventure is the emotional crux of the film, and the real driving spirit. She may be extremely younger than Clooney is, but she is an old soul. Their relationship and chemistry is amazing, and should she have been acting against a less capable actor, I doubt she would be anywhere near as powerful as she is.The supporting cast, made up of Beau Bridges, Judy Greer, Nick Krause, Robert Forster and an almost unrecognizable Matthew Lilliard, are all excellent in their small roles. All of them get some really memorable moments to shine, and help to make Clooney and Woodley's performances even greater. Special mention needs to go to both Patricia Hastie, who is confined to a hospital bed for all but about thirty seconds of her screen-time as Matt's wife Elizabeth, and newcomer Miller as Scottie. She is naive and innocent throughout, never once coming off as that annoying kid you try to forget exists. She has a lot of fun in the role, and strikes a real emotional chord at just the right moments. I can only hope directors continue to use her in the future for roles that are just as good, if not better.It may have taken me practically two months to write about it, but I still find myself at a loss for words about The Descendants. It is finally rolling out into theatres now, and I cannot wait to see the film again. The cast is amazing, with Clooney coming out swinging. Payne may have taken his time finding a follow-up for Sideways, but what he has returned with is nothing short of amazing. Run, drive, fly ? whatever you have to do, just make sure you do not miss it.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a person who's lived through it....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in a while, and that's judging it from what it is. I became a fan of A P after watching Sideways and ended up reading the book before watching the movie. I think the biggest problem people have with this movie is that it's not the typical "HOLLYWOOD" movie that forces "emotion" down our throat nor is it the typical "INDIE" film with shaky cameras, far out one shots and so on. It's simple, a bit plain, and raw. We're presented with characters that may not seem interesting at first look, but when it comes down to it, AP has once again showed us a reflection of ourselves and people we know around us. We're normal. We're not all flashy people with cool lives and have interesting personalities. Some people just ARE and live that way. I recently lost the person who would have been my mother in law. I'm twenty four, and my girlfriend is twenty two, and her little sister is fourteen. My girlfriend has recently taken custody over her sister, and with their father passing away before the little sister was born, I've found myself in a bit of a father role and it's scary and new and very strange at times. I completely related to Clooney's character right away, and could feel the frustration he felt, and the emotions he felt. I think he did well with dealing with them. It felt real to me. In fact, everyone's emotions toward the tragedy the film presents felt very real. I saw those same reactions from sisters, aunties, uncles, grandfathers and grandmothers. Some blamed others while others completely lost it. Some felt mad, while others just cried and broke down. Some were oblivious to the news(like the grand mother in the movie) while others were simply there to comfort(Sid). I really appreciated the entire movie, scenery, and dialogue(and at times lack there of). I really enjoyed the frustration they felt one minute, the humor the next, and the forgetfulness of the tragedy at times. It was like seeing a movie based on what my girlfriend and I were going through, and it felt comforting that someone had captured that so well. Not every tragedy will be filled with a room full of criers. Some might. Not all we be filled with humor and relief. Some will. For us, it was everything. It didn't seem real, and at times, it seemed dull. This movie has a special way of presenting itself in that manner and I really liked it. I'm sure not everyone will like. Either they're use to super hero action movies, horror movies, or stuff like Twilight. Maybe you are into good dramas and indie flicks and for whatever reason you didn't connect with that one. For me, a person who's just lived through it and am discovering to be a dad type to someone I'm still getting to know?it was simple, perfect.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just awful. What a disappointment. Clooney's acting was wooden and forced. I thought maybe the scenery could save this wreck of a film, but most of the scenes were shot during rainstorms. The plot was almost non- existent, not developed to any reasonable extent. I started looking at my watch 45 minutes into the boredom, and welcomed a visit to the bathroom. I just can't believe the rating and the accolades this movie is getting by the admitted majority of commenters here. The scene where Clooney "ran" to confront his neighbor's about concealing his wife's affair was lamentable. Well, I've just about wasted enough time writing ten lines to enable me to get this review posted. Do yourselves a favor, wait for the release on network TV - don't waste a penny on this drivel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT (It's way at the bottom and MARKED). Clooney is stiff as a plank in this overlong, unsatisfactory drama. The first hint you get is the opening with heavy-handed narration. Narration is always a bad sign. The movie simply PLODS onward from that inauspicious beginning. While the movie does avoid the soap-opera aspects of the story, it betrays its only interesting character. Here's the SPOILER: I'm talking about Syd, the glib, prize-jackass boyfriend of the unstable/semi-druggie older daughter. The dope who thinks granny's Alzheimer's is funny. Everybody grows up a little in this story (except, I guess, the younger daughter, who's a cipher--just there for others to worry about) but the one who grows up most and most unexpectedly is Syd. So much so that in fact, in a late scene at the hospital, where Clooney is being unfairly jumped on, Syd is the FIRST to stand up for him. This character development creeps up on you because a) it's subtle and b) there ain't much else, but it's the stand-out of the film. Apart from that, the script MAKES him important: there's a protracted if unbelievable scene in which Clooney has a late-night 'what would you do in my shoes?' heart-to-heart talk with him alone. Yet after all that the script just dumps him. Not even dumps him--that would require some action of some sort. He's just completely omitted from the climactic scenes, as if he never existed. And so this is an utterly unmemorable movie. Six months from now even its fans will struggle to remember it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe that the same people who ridicule and dismiss movies I like for being "predictable" praising this less-than-mediocre Hawaii-based soap opera to the skies. Is it because of the movie's philanthropic "cause"? 50 First Dates was a far less predictable and more original Hawaii-based movie than this sorry retread.I want someone to tell me with a straight face that they didn't know after the movie's first 20 minutes how Clooney would lead the family in resolving the pristine Hawaiian land situation. Or that despite the fact that his children begin the movie as typically uncontrollable hell-raisers with no relationship with their workaholic father that by the end of our road-movie adventure, both daughters would get in line and resolve to be good girls and to help each other. What a surprise.And filling in the space between this, we learn that the older daughter became more estranged because she confronted her mother over an affair she was having. Learning this, Clooney storms in to the neighbor's house as the classic clichéd cuckolded husband demanding to know with whom his wife is having an affair. As happens only in Hollywood, his emasculated husband of a best friend, comes out and tells him the guy's name. And what a coincidence, when they are about to give up trying to find out what the guy looks like, we pass a realty sign with the guy's name and picture on it! Wow, what do you know about that? Oh yeah, did I mention that Clooney knows that Mom is not ever going to come out of the coma she got into as a result of a boating accident, but that he doesn't have the courage to muster to tell the younger daughter while he's going around breaking the news to half of Oahu? (Did anyone see Grace is gone?) So, now, of course, he is so obsessed with confronting the guy with whom his wife had the affair that he uproots troubled daughter from school and throws all his all-consuming work to the side while he takes the family off to the big island for an impromptu holiday - all the time not telling the younger daughter why he's there.I keep hearing how this is such a different part for Clooney. I don't see this character that different from his character in Up In The Air. His acting is fine, but not the drastic departure that critics are trying to make it. The actresses playing the girls are somewhat adequate but their quick transformation from self-centered and obsessive hell-raisers to sweet troupers doing what they can to support Daddy seems unrealistic and seamless. Robert Forster as the dead wife's arrogant father and Beau Bridges as one of the senior cousins are both wonderfully poignant in their small supporting roles. The young actor playing the older daughter's friend Sid who winds up being part of all these adventures is wonderfully refreshing and offbeat and might be the most interesting character in the movie. That would be a movie that would be much better than this predictably maudlin mess which would have been more suitable for Lifetime than to be a major motion picture being considered for Academy Awards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Descendants (2011)Wow, lots of great sharp close-ups of George Clooney. And a wonderful place to set a movie, contemporary Hawaii, not just the surf and nature scene, but the reality, too, of family and people interacting casually.There's a forced plot here, a do good situation where some precious Hawaiian land is in danger of being developed, and you know almost from the first minute it's mentioned what the outcome will be. There's a second plot, too, which is more intense, having to do with an affair that gets uncovered and Clooney's sense of discovery and retribution for it.But what is supposed to be the main point of the movie, in terms of emotional intensity at least, is the trickiest and maybe the thinnest: Clooney's wife is in a coma and is set to have her life support unplugged and then shortly die. His two daughters are supposed to be mischief makers of the worst sort (unconvincingly) and the drama of the oncoming death and the affair discovered during the midst of it all makes the father and daughters reconsider each other.Sounds good but it only goes so far. Which is to say it's not a bad movie at all, just nothing that rises above. The one mention during, say, Academy Awards month was that Clooney's performance was standout. And it was, though not any more than other Clooney performances, restrained and consummately professional the same way Tom Hanks is. Which is often just a hair short of the breathtaking stuff others pull off at their best.The best part of the movie is probably just the relative accuracy of the local Hawaiian culture, relaxed and appreciative but also caught up in the usual material and family concerns of any other U.S. locale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feel bad movie of the holidays!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie should be sued for false advertising! They are selling it as a warm and fuzzy feel good comedy. It is not. There are a few (very few) funny moments. The trailers do not show the mom in a boating accident going into a coma and everyone having to deal with the outcome. It is made harder when it quickly shows she was not a saint. This is a depressing movie that moves at a very slow pace. There are a couple side plots. One of which has Clooney's character being the head of a trust that holds many acres of prime Hawaiian land that is in the family and must soon be sold making all the family members very rich. Does he sell out to the rich tourists or keep the land pure and unused?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel like the little boy who shouted to the crowd "the emperor has no clothes!" This film was tedious in the extreme, pointless in its storyline and bereft of any real emotional content. I found myself thinking at the end "so what?" I found nothing about the characters either likable or interesting and indeed for me every single performance bar one was utterly one dimensional. Cloony was boring and the younger cast simply flat and dissatisfying. The only exception to that was Elizabeth King, the one in bed. It must be a bad year for films if this is up for getting awards. It left me with the feeling that you get when you eat one of those meals that just does not agree with you and sits on your stomach like a lead weight. This film was a lead weight from start to finish and I left the cinema untouched, unmoved and unrewarded by the entire experience. Am I really the only one in the crowd that saw this film for what it was? trite and abysmal?</fullReview>

Oh ya, and my daughter tags along on my mission.Am I missing something or are these very rich and entitled people ?insane? I left this movie feeling like I had been poisoned. It is astounding to me that this "plot" could make it to the screen. The only chance this movie had with me was when the neighbor boy finally brings the pain of his life to Mr. King ?and King completely drops the ball. If it is not about him, he isn't interested. This is a very sick movie for a very depressed nation.I honestly felt sorry for Shailene Woodley and I wish her all the best. I hope your next role will be about people that reside on the planet earth and not some cloud koo koo land.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My only regret about this movie is that it took me this long to see it. The Descendants, is one of those films that fully succeeds at what it is trying to accomplish. George Clooney fully engulfs himself into the character of Matt King, and his emotional range sways from moments of pure pleasure to those of betrayal and discomfort. Clooney's spectacular and award winning performance is only outdone by Alexander Payne's ability to portray a beautiful slice of heaven in Hawaii while at the same time breaking the viewers heart with devastating character developments and scenes that will undoubtedly have an emotionally conscious viewer on the verge of tears. Even the brief supporting roles of Beau Bridges, Matthew Lilliard, and Judy Greer feel so real and intense that at times it felt like I wasn't watching a film at all, but rather the lives of several individuals in some of their most vulnerable moments. To put it simply, Clooney gives a knockout performance and the Descendants is surely one the most outstanding films of the year. If I had to choose one, this would have to be my choice for the Best Picture of 2011. A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess someone thought it to be a good idea to latch on the Clooney's far more entertaining project 'Up in the Air' and copy the whole enchilada onto a different story and cash in. Well, it's not going to work. The story is completely unconvincing and feels designed by computer software. Much like your every day-time soap, if those things are still running. I wouldn't know really since I tossed my TV out of my house years ago. The performances feel like the plastic used to wrap microwave dinners and that is exactly what this film amounts to. A cheap, run of the mill pathos seeking ordeal that will leave you scratching your cranium as to why people are so incredibly undemanding when it comes to this type of entertainment, given its current rating.I really don't know what to say else. The banality and obvious shortcomings of the movie kinda stumps me as I try to think of more ways to describe its rather obvious inferiority.It should speak for itself, but apparently doesn't.</fullReview>

While leaving the viewer feeling sad and dirty. One of the worst movies I've seen in a while.I think the aim was to create an emotional movie, but it falls short.

		<fullReview>This is by far the worst Clooney movie I've seen yet!,and there has been many!!! It was so boring within the first 45 minutes I kept falling asleep. Ralph and I walked out...the manager gave us back our money. Clooney had no emotions, no expressions, no nothing. All he did was just read the script....he acted like he did not even want to be in this movie. The agony of trying to keep awake in this movie was just too hard for us to take. The manager of the movie theater said that this is the general response he is getting from others....he does not want to see this movie either. I cannot believe Clooney is up for an award, except for worst actor and worst picture! George looks very tired in this picture....I do believe he found it hard to keep awake also, his age is beginning to show. The Ides of March...thank goodness Ryan Gosling took the lead in this picture. Also, the writers for this movie.....I don't know what they were thinking....very poor writing.</fullReview>

I really really don't understand what people saw in this. Some things I didn't like: shallow conversations, predictable plot, the whole story could have been told in 30 minutes instead of 2 hours, unending fill-ins with Hawaiian music and scenery. Also disappointed with George Clooney - he has not helped his career or legacy by playing in this disaster. If you want to see "Descendants" because it's by the director of "Sideways", this movie is in a different league, and not in a good way. Conclusion: don't waste your time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Descendants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Newly minted Best Picture (Drama) at this year's Golden Globes, along with George Clooney being awarded the Best Actor (Drama) award, The Descendants is Alexander Payne's latest film since Sideways, based upon the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings. Dealing with the central character of Matt King (Clooney) as the trustee of his extended family's trust of thousands of acres of untouched land on the island of Kaua'i, Hawaii, Clooney puts in a commanding performance that deals with one man's plight on many fronts, from his children, his wife, his relatives and having to make tough decisions that will affect the lives of his kindred.As with Payne's films, the challenges that stand in the protagonist's way are what make the film highly engaging, and Clooney drops his film star demeanour to play the everyday man who faces issues that aren't too far fetched, discovering that his now comatose wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) has been cheating on him, and trying to reconnect with estranged daughter Alex (Shailene Woodley) and 10 year old Scottie (Amara Miller) since he's a dad who's seldom at home and seen. And as if matters of the family cannot get anymore complicated, here comes the extended family of cousins and just about everyone related to the King real estate who have to decide, ultimately by Matt himself, how to best sell off their inherited land in order to maximize their profits, with a deadline to boot.With the multiple narrative threads dealing at a microscopic emotional level - trying hard to come to terms with a cheating spouse where you know you've drawn the shortest possible end of the stick given the state of the other half, and having a teenage daughter who doesn't quite understand you, they provide that grounding to make it easy to identify with Matt King the man who's really quite down on his luck on family matters. The plot threads expand to his near obsession to want to discover with whom his wife has been cheating with, and to bear the brunt of an incessantly sarcastic father-in-law who doesn't take her daughter's comatose state all too kindly.But it's not all doom, gloom and filled with negative emotions here, as the film does have its fair share of lighter moments courtesy of characters like Alexandra's insensitive loud mouthed friend Sid (Nick Krause) who comes along for the road trip of sorts, though almost always punctuated with that tinge of inevitable sadness in the air. Moments of poetic justice also makes you want to whoop for joy, although you tend to weigh in on these moments and make you think - would you want to maximize benefits for those in your family, or for selfish reasons choose not to remotely reward someone who had done you a great wrong. Such is the tussle and wrangle Matt has to deal with, and makes The Descendants one really topsy- turvy emotional ride, which on one hand one wants to appear magnanimous, while on the other having to suppress the urge to just punch out.And Clooney deserves his award for making Matt King so believable, junking his glamorous self for something far more affable at first, before the problems start to pile, each with a deadline of its own, and wondering when he would crack under undue pressure, emotionally and physically. Sharing perfect daughter-father relationship chemistry with Clooney is Shailene Woodley who in my opinion is an up and coming young actress to look out for, showcasing a wide range of emotions here, and a scene which I thought brought out her best when her character got broken the news of her mom's condition.Alexander Payne crafts a meaningful, dramatic film that questions whether we should let the truth be always told, or to allow whatever the version it is in to pass, and to seek to forgive others even when we're wronged. And he deftly handles once again a protagonist who is put in a dilemma with monumental tasks to tackle, although you know they'd somehow converge together toward the end given the web of relationships that exists. Primed to be a firm contender for Best Picture come Oscar season soon, I'm quite certain this is a winner in its own way and doesn't need a golden statue to reaffirm that. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll never get that time back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be honest there wasn't a lot of other great films on in the cinema this weekend, having already seen The woman in black and The artist, it was ultimately The descendants or Ghost rider 2: spirit of vengeance. The obvious choice was the descendants... Or was it? I had heard nothing about the film before sitting down to watch it, open minded I watched the trailers and then the beautiful opening shots of scenery... Then Clooney's voice over kicked in. Essentially it only goes down hill from there as cliché'd character after cliché'd character crawl out of the woodwork, Clooney himself doing an admirable impression of someone who is quite frankly emotionally retarded and completely transparent as an actor.I can't even remember his characters name, I was completely aware the entire way through the film that it was George Clooney, not his character, bumbling around in Hawaii for almost 2 hours. (It felt like days) I have never found it harder to empathise with a "character" as much as the one Clooney attempts to play in this film. I didn't care about him at all, in fact I just wanted his wife to hurry up and die, so that I could leave, having never walked out of a film in my life. George aside, the dialogue was generally awful and Clooney was supported by a wide array of poorly fleshed out and stereotypical characters, none as bad as "Sid". The 2d performances of all the actors were thrown together in such a bizarre way that it made the entire film resemble some sort make shift scaffolding leading nowhere and with no real purpose, that teetered on the brink of collapse at any given moment. I would go on but I assume you get the point.TL;DR Don't see this film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants has one and a half stories. One that barely goes anywhere and half a story that goes nowhere. We are led to believe that the half a story is the significant one but there is no reason for that. I'll tell about this movie from the perspective of the actual story.Clooney plays King a rich lawyer who is descendant of a long line of Hawaiian landowners. All the lands are in a trust and he's in charge. The trust will dissolve in a couple of years so it's time to do something about it. Most of the relatives want to sell and there are two buyers. A local and an outsider. Most, including King, favor the local.But as the family meetings to decide all this approach, King's wife ends up in a coma from an accident on the water. Per her wishes, she is disconnected from life support. King now has to take care of his two daughters, a 10 year old and a troubled 17 year old.In one of the few meaningful lines in the movie we learn that the older daughter fought with her mother because the mother was cheating on King. That puts everything on the back-burner for King as he now wants to find out about the other guy. The older daughter helps him with that mission. It turns out, in one of those only-in-the-movie coincidences that the other guy is a real estate agent, cousin of the local prospective buyer of the King lands. He would end up making a ton of money if the family decides to sell to the local. That of course will influence King's decision process come time to meet with his cousins.Along for the ride is the older daughter's boyfriend/friend a dumb surfer dude, who just expresses his opinions without filter and that gets him in trouble.The filmmakers want to convince us that the comatose woman story is what matters here and there sure are endless shots of the dying woman's face for some reason. We meet her parents, the mom with Alzheimer's and the short-tempered dad who blames King for the accident. Since the woman is disconnected she dies eventually and the family ends up watching TV.It is remarkable and unfortunate that a lazy script like this got made into a movie. How many true scriptwriters are out there trying to sell great ideas. This script would have made a decent short film, perhaps. But most definitely not a 2 hour movie. It's a half baked movie all around. Directionless, dull, lame, and worst of all pointless. We don't learn anything about the hardships of life. King is clueless, so is everyone else, including and especially the filmmakers. He ends up resorting to the dopey boyfriend for advice. But King seems really like a stranger to his kids, he knows nothing about them. The supposedly troubled teen is pretty levelheaded once she is given a mission to assist in the search for the other guy.What makes the movie watchable is the cast for the most part. Clooney- cast against type- and Woodley try their best here but what do they have to work with- not a lot. Despite the serious issues, the tone of the movie is always off, giving it a silly lightness that is unsuited and ridiculous. It's impossible to recommend this movie, there is nothing here worthwhile- let alone award-winning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a lot of disregard for this film and a lot for Clooney, and it really put me off wanting to see this film.But if you disregard the disregard (ha ha) you will be awarded with one of the most fruitful, funny, and touching films made in a very long time.Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer who owns a lot of Hawaian land thanks to a legacy (hence the title). To cut a long story short, his wife is in a major boating accident, has to look after his daughters, and finds out his wife was having an affair.All this with the added pressure of his cousins wanting to sell the beloved land.Time for a road trip to meet the other man in his wife's life.....Clooney owns this film, as he is in every scene almost and really puts you into Matts shoes. Every emotion is shown here, and even little things, such as the moment where he makes uncomfortable eye contact with a man on a plane, his performance is perfect.The rest of the cast are great to, especially Forster and Woodley, as they add a bit of life to the film. Payne has really handled Woodleys character well, because when we first meet her, you think that this is just another spoilt rich girl who hates her dad because he's not there.But is could not be further from the truth and it's clear that Payne is having a ball pulling the rug from under her feet. And it's her revelation that really turns the film on it's head.Payne mixes the bitter with the sweet, and for every heart wrenching moment, there is a scene or a line that is literally laugh out loud funny.All in all, it's a great movie about finding yourself, and realising that life is too short and making every second count.The film finishes perfectly,with three people sitting on a couch eating Ice Cream. It sounds boring, but the feeling of togetherness in the most simplest of scenarios, is perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is something going on in Alexander Payne's The Descendants which makes me not care too much about its characters or plot. I cared about his earlier creations in Election and Sideways, but the family in this film feels stale and wooden. Just like his past films, the central character here, Matt King (George Clooney), is facing some tough problems, but this time they are not even of his design but are thrust upon him. Matt is even much more likable than the Broderick in Election or Giamatti in Sideways, but that does not make him any more interesting to watch.Matt is a lawyer on Oahu and is very well off. He is the sole decision-maker in a trust set up by his ancestors, Hawaiian royalty, in a large and undeveloped tract of land which hotel magnates and golf course developers are just aching to pay him a very large amount of money to take off of his hands. The majority of the other trustees are eager to sell as well, but Matt is holding all of the cards on the deal. The land issue is more background though because Matt's wife Elizabeth is in a coma. She hit her head while in a boat race and the doctors do not know if she will wake up or not.This leaves Matt, self-described in a monologue as the 'back-up parent', to deal with his two daughters. Since problems rarely come along one at a time, Matt also finds out at this point that Elizabeth was cheating on him with a local real estate tycoon, Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard). With his wife in a coma and an extremely significant land deal on the horizon, Matt makes the most obvious choice any Alexander Payne character would choose, he takes off to Kauai with his daughters and an imbecile surfer dude, Sid (Nick Krause), to spy on Brian Speer and possibly confront him.This road-trip, similar in respect to the trip to the vineyards in Sideways, lumps together an odd assortment of characters and then sits back to watch them as they place far too much emphasis on trivial events which are manifested into needless drama. Sideways was quirky, meandering in a pleasant way, and intellectual. The Descendants is more on par with Election; you do not particularly like the protagonists and instead of quirky, it feels more like plodding.However, just like Sideways, The Descendants has a definite sense of place. Present day Hawaii comes across as stifling not only in the city, but also on the beach while you are attempting to spy on the guy who made you a cuckold. Perhaps it is island fever impacting the actions of Matt and infecting the musty moods of the rest of the cast.The script does not rise to the level it set up for itself. Clooney and his elder daughter Alex (Shailene Woodley) are angry and on a quest, but the writing is flat and the pacing is off. There are one-dimensional and tiring extended breaks between plot points which may have achieved a deeper emotional impact if they tried a bit harder or if the daughters were not so snotty. They are crass and relentlessly bitter to the point of distraction. Matt has the most right to be angry and spiteful, but thankfully he does not hang it blatantly around his neck and choose to be a one note character ala Alex.I do not know why most of the rest of the film going public is raving about The Descendants. Alexander Payne has been great in the past, but he has misfired here. I have no doubt he will back with another enjoyable movie in the future, but I recommend you sit this one out or if you have not seen it, go back and enjoy Sideways. Leave The Descendants where they are, stewing in Hawaii.</fullReview>

I found nothing redeemable about any part of it. In no part of the story did I feel empathy, even for the woman lying on the bed dying. Perhaps there were a few words slung about attesting to her character, but most of the accolades were given by her father who appeared to be in complete denial. He seemed to truly not know his daughter at all. I usually can find something redeemable about a movie somewhere. Not this. I did not care what happened to a single person in the story. At the end as the daughters were sitting on the couch, one big happy family of three now....sharing a bowl of cereal or something with their Dad...I kept waiting for one of them to say, "Mom's dead.

		<fullReview>After all the Oscar-buzz going around, I decided to try this movie. As critics talked about is as "Clooney's breakthrough", I couldn't help but think this was going to be an excellent movie.Boy, was I wrong.Starting with the screenplay, you can tell that it's not well written. It's as if you're missing something in between the lines and you can't actually grasp it. And the actors don't seem to help any, either.Clooney is fine, I guess, even though his expressions or emotions don't seem as satisfying as you thought they would be; Woodley is not experienced enough, and you can tell this by the way she whines and acts as if she's still in her own TV show; Miller and Krause are just... unimportant. You don't care much for their characters, even if you eventually feel like slapping them both.The characters are annoying, overall, and they seem to change personalities as the movie comes to an end.I don't see the potential. I don't see how it won 2 Golden Globes or how it has been nominated for an Oscar. Are the critics seeing something else entirely? Is there some hidden message we can't figure out? Who knows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was recommended the film by my son, purchased a copy and sat down for a view and honestly didn't expect much but it took just minutes and I was captive to the story! My respect and admiration for Clooney's acting abilities has grown (save for 'The American' and 'The Monuments Men', which are total crap!) however with offerings like 'Up In the Air', 'Burn After Reading', 'Syriana', 'The Men who stare at Goats', 'Michael Clayton'. 'Oh Brother where art Thou' and others as well, Clooney has cemented his acting credentials with me. But George please pick your material a little more carefully. I purchased 'The Monuments Men' because you were in it, couldn't finish it and got 3 dollars in trade for it at a used book store (and it was a Blu-ray copy). It's hard to forgive that but I've managed but I will do some vetting of your work in the future. At any rate I highly recommend 'The Descendants' to everyone, if you have any intelligence at all you will enjoy this film! I promise!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Descendants (2011): Dir: Alexander Payne / Cast: George Clooney, Shailene Woodley, Amara Miller, Nick Krause, Matthew Lillard: Alexander Payne is a director of incredible insight into the trials of those who know better but will no doubt embrace their better nature after the storm. He proves this with masterpieces such as Election, About Schmidt and Sideways. Here, at last, is another masterpiece. This one regards generations and what is passed down to our children. George Clooney delivers one of his greatest performances as a husband and father who is involved in land management, and currently holds the controlling shares of massive land controlled by his extended family. They want him to sell while his daughters want him to keep it. Central plot regards his wife in a boating accident that places her in a coma on life support. Then comes the news that she was having an affair. Clooney balances grief, frustration, anger, and the need to understand and deal with his daughters. He treks them to Hawaii in search on his wife's beau, a real estate salesman, and Payne handles this with blunt truth and payoff. Shailene Woodley plays older daughter picked up at boarding school where her drunken behaviour harbours resentment. Amara Miller plays younger daughter whose mind is impressionable. Nick Strause steals scenes as Woodley's boyfriend who often speaks before he thinks. Matthew Lillard plays the guilty male whom had the affair with Clooney's wife. Great film regarding the scars left by others, and our attempts to heal them for the good of those whom depend on it. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-rated piece of garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this movie my review for all 10 best pic Oscar nominees 2012 are done. However, with all the hype and the inclusion of Clooney inside this film, The Descendants unfortunately turned out to be an overrated piece of garbage to me.Yes, there is enough heartwarming &amp; thought -provoking moments, good acting and solid script early on, but all the clichéd drama throughout failed to cover up for the many serious flaws in this movie. A huge Minus Point -- Matt King is supposedly a heavyweight established real estate agent, but what he did as the sole trustee in the last quarter of the movie is entirely illogical, senseless, unprofessional and clearly driven by personal desire, without considering the consequences, that made me VERY VERY unconvinced. Also, I am rather unconvinced at his dramatic anger towards his wife when the movie has made it clear they were out of touch for so long. The daughters did not seem to be sufficiently affected by the family crisis as much as I would have expected.In fact, the only character that surprisingly caught my interest is Sid's, because the film manages to show two sides of him, albeit briefly.To top it off, as if Matt King had not done enough to maul the ending, there comes Julie, who came to the final scene. Although she arrived at the scene initially with commendable courage, why did she had to screw things up--what a 'good' role model for spouses who are getting cheated out there.Upon watching the ending, I am pretty sure the most likely path down the road is further destruction of the whole King family -- involving the rest of the cousins and the elder members. Is that a nice lesson to be heard from a movie with such a title? Might as well rebrand it as THE DESCENDANTS OF FAILURE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably awful in every conceivable way - including the scenic..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.....although perhaps the intent was to make Hawaii seem ordinary rather than spectacular, a place where a non -functional family would be within the norm, rather than an affront to nature.. I couldn't and still can't believe that the movie I saw last night is one that not only led to the creation of so much laudatory prose, but also to award consideration for the actors... There is not a single insight into actual character here, and certainly not to the devastation that the loss of a parent has on a family, particularly where the surviving parent is so absent, so clueless. George Clooney,usually a captivating screen presence, and certainly a better than average actor, was wooden, dull, his motivations murky..Awful film... not even worth continuing my own diatribe.Norma Manna Blum</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Life in Retrospect in The DESCENDENTS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne has written and directed films (Sideways, About Schmidt) about men at unique crossroads in life and coming to grim, sobering realizations that cause a reevaluation of the past and an uncertain future. In The Descendents, he focuses on a man's family dealing with grief and the hidden truths that threaten to tear it apart. George Clooney is outstanding as a na?ve husband and father who must confront life after a terrible series of events.A water skiing accident in Hawaii has left a woman in a coma and her husband/lawyer, Matt (George Clooney), grief stricken and stunned by the news that she was having an affair with another man. It seems that everyone knew about the affair but Matt who was too busy with his work to even notice, and he must come to terms with it and rebuild his family. Matt's daughters are a troubled ten year old Scottie (Amara Miller) and his older teen, Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) who has a spacy boyfriend, Sid. As the family realizes that their mom may never recover, they must make some major decisions, and Matt must find the truth even if it means confronting the man who stole her heart. Meanwhile, Matt, as the primary trustee for the extended family, has an impending major land sale he must decide upon that could be a financial windfall for his relatives. Determined to meet his wife's lover, Matt does some detective work and, with some help from his daughters, finally arranges to meet the object of his obsession which causes him to reassess his own life and his relationship with his daughters.This is Clooney's film all the way, and he gives a thoroughly convincing portrait of a man betrayed and oblivious to his wife and his family. He is not the handsome, dashing Clooney of Oceans 11 or Ides of March but rather an unglamorous fellow who is vulnerable. The pain and realization he emotes is heartfelt. Woodley lends excellent support as the knowing daughter who helps her father's quest.Through much of the story you wonder if Matt will exact some kind of revenge on the creep or do something impulsive. That bit of tension only adds to an engaging plot. In the end, Matt does the right things and brings closure for his family. The final shot is great as Matt tries to become a dad again to his girls. A major subplot involving the land deal gets even more complicated as surprising information is revealed when Matt investigates his wife's lover. There are occasional moments of hilarity as when Matt is at the end of his rope and resorts to asking Sid for advice. It is a riot of a moment.There are good details which add to our understanding of Matt's family including his cranky father-in-law (Robert Forster) and a mother-in-law who has Alzheimer's disease. What is special about a film like this is that each major character evolves through events and changed to a degree by the end (including spacy Sid). That marks good character development. These are not cardboard caricature but fully etched individuals with weaknesses like anyone, and our initial impressions about each are dispelled by film's end.The Hawaiian scenery is gorgeous but never used as a travelogue. It merely sets the scene as did the wineries in Sideways and in some ways, the tropical paradise serves as counterpoint to the despair and angst that Matt must endure.You could imagine a Broadway version of this story since it relies more on characters and situation. The film makes you care for and sustain interest in the main characters (brought to life by a strong cast) and what happens to them. In the end, there is sadness and regret but also hope, the kind of hope that strengthens and bonds a family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a usual "reviewer". But seeing people giving bad reviews to this film really makes me wonder where were they looking. All i've wanted to say that it's really good. Hawaiian atmosphere is spot on with it's soothing music themes, ocean waves and sun. Story about a guy in a very difficult situation is trivial and somehow cliché, but you won't care about it, because it's told through amazing characters. Aged Clooney fits perfectly into dads' role and even "tag-along" character Sid (Nick Krause) is good.Just don't over think everything and i promise, you'll love it. Paul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching and incredibly acted film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This poignant story is simultaneously tragic and comical, a feat not many movies even attempt to claim, and this one nails it. Through the situation and the circumstances surrounding it, we witness Matt's journey through his grief. The character development is so fluid that you don't always notice it until after it's happened.Alexander Payne did a great job directing. As I watch I am so absorbed in the story and characters that I feel that I am witnessing it all happen right in front of me, like I'm a fly on the wall in this moving story. The actors are exceptional for the most part, as though they aren't really acting ? which always makes for the most believable characters. Amara Miller who plays Matt's younger daughter Scottie did amazing in her first role. I look forward to seeing her in more movies. The story itself is not amazing. It is rather forgettable; it was a novel first, and probably makes a stronger impact as a book.One of the problems I had with this film is with the character of Matt. Faced with so much we rarely see him vulnerable, and he always is taking the high road, and being the better man. But in the situations he's faced with, I find that pretty inconceivable. Any real person faced with the kinds of revelations he is faced with couldn't be expected to deal with them in such stride. And even though the character wasn't written entirely authentic (in my opinion), George Clooney still did an excellent portrayal ? the best role I've seen him play. But I still would give the Oscar to Jean Dujardin for 'The Artist'. But George will probably walk away with the gold anyhow, the Academy loves him, and every year it seems that the Academy Awards are becoming more and more about the politics. Please surprise me this year Academy!Okay, enough of that; back to my review:Will this movie cling to my memories for years? Probably not, but it was interesting to see George Clooney flourish in a different role than he usually takes on. Though the story isn't memorable, it is touching, and there is a good mix of comedic relief that lightens the heavy subject matter nicely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Languid exploration of love, loss and infidelity in paradise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Alexander Payne has been quiet for several years, his last film being Sideways in 2004. Is he subscribing to the Stanley Kubrick and Terrence Malick philosophy of film-making, which basically states that you do absolutely nothing for years, then return with a masterpiece so that anyone who might forget is soon reminded how good you are? Payne certainly has some way to go before he can be mentioned in the same breath as those two greats. However, he is building an impressive body of work ? Sideways we've mentioned already, but there's also About Schmidt, Election, Citizen Ruth?. and now The Descendants. A striking filmography by anyone's standards.A middle-aged woman skims across the sea in a motor boat, hair billowing behind her, laughing joyously. The very next scene finds the same woman comatose on a hospital bed, face bruised and swollen, tubes protruding from all over her body. Her husband Matt King (George Clooney) stands over her, grimly contemplating his lot in life. "Paradise?" he grunts bitterly. "Paradise can go f@ck itself!" Gradually, we learn that Matt is a wealthy lawyer who, due to a quirk of history, is the sole trustee of a sizable stretch of virgin Hawaiian coast. Despite his wealth, his relationship with his wife and kids has grown increasingly remote. Now, her coma forces Matt to confront issues he has been hiding from for years. He suddenly finds himself responsible for ten year-old daughter Scottie (Amara Miller) and 17 year-old tearaway Alex (Shailene Woodley). On top of that is the fact that the whole family are due to meet imminently to discuss what to do with their piece of paradise. And as if that isn't enough, Matt finds himself on the receiving end of the ultimate bombshell - when Alex tells him she recently caught mom having an affair.The entire film is about Matt's long journey to resolution ? how he resolves his wife's infidelity, his craving to re-connect with his kids, the fate of the land bequeathed to his family, the impending death of his wife, etc. In typical Payne fashion, the story never follows the expected course. It weaves quite wonderfully in various directions, never playing to convention yet never losing sight of the human drama at its core. Clooney demonstrates a surprising emotional range - quietly furious one moment, comically absurd the next ? while Woodley as the eldest daughter is simply outstanding. The quality of the other acting is exceptional too? whatever else you think of The Descendants, it is certainly an immaculately acted film. Also admirable is the way the script manages to make Hawaii itself an integral "character" in the unfolding drama. It's been a long time since a story and a setting have complemented each other so consummately. The second half of the film - in which Matt tries to track down the realtor with whom his wife had her illicit affair - is slightly less compelling than the first. The story begins to sag in places, but at least Payne's off-kilter handling keeps things eminently watchable through these moments. Some viewers may be put off by the film's intentionally slow place, but in reality it is not so much a slow movie as a languid one, where events and characters are carefully developed in a way which feels convincing and honest. One has to be prepared to adjust to the pace, but once the film sinks its hook into you it keeps you absorbed all the way to its bittersweet final shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Diane and I saw the film this morning and we were both very impressed although neither one of us enjoy family drama situations particularly involving adolescent kids. Payne gives us a superb glimpse into the dark corners of a contemporary family when tragedy strikes unexpectedly and the people in that family must deal with situations both unexpected and personally shattering. How all concerned handle the unexpected is the core of this marvelous film. As with the media commentators I must agree that this is Clooney's best performance to date but having said that I believe all the cast are excellent. Payne's sensitive direction allows the difficulties faced by all concerned to be realized by all the individuals involved without allowing the film to descend into the emotional morass frequently forced upon the viewer by Holleywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mahalo, cast and crew and everyone associated with this great, funny, heartbreaking and beautiful film. It is a film anyone who has lost a loved one too soon (It is ALWAYS to soon to lose a loved one) can identify with from the opening scenes of jarring Hawaiian images to a simple, quiet, comforting family tableau, perfect in its simplicity. The stages of grief: disbelief, anger, denial, resolution, are all there. But so is a kaleidoscope of everyday life that surrounds the grief, that makes the grief bearable--the moments of surprising humor, the life stories both ridiculous and truthful, that make life fascinating, that make life the great human comedy and great human tragedy that keeps us guessing, keeps us striving, keeps us coping and enduring.The characters are all vividly etched, and powerfully portrayed by a stellar cast from George Clooney's majestic, conflicted, ultimately heartbreaking Matt, to his beloved, infuriating, but ultimately wise and charming daughters, Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller, to the enjoyably goofy teenage boyfriend with a surprisingly poignant past, Nick Krause's Sid to a whole host of neighbors and friends and extended family, all of whom seem oddly familiar--so carefully cast and played with short revealing moments highlighting each of them. What an assortment of characters! SAG -- take notice of this ensemble when you give out your award this year!! There are images in this film that are sure to endure: the silent cry of grief underwater of Matt's elder daughter, the final, haunting ceremony in the waters of Waikiki, as the ashes of Matt's wife drift away in the azure waters, the calm, comforting walk along the beach of Matt and his family as day turns into the "only in Hawaii" dusk, with the golden light highlighting their newly discovered bond, the quiet spying through the slightly opened hospital room door on Elizabeth's old "p***k" of a father, as his face becomes contorted with unbearable, painful grief as he says his final goodbye. The moments of grief are handled so carefully and are vivid but also understated, so that they become all the more powerful, and we never feel manipulated -- we only feel as if we are sharing the feelings of these memorable and exquisitely etched characters. Somehow, we ultimately wish all of them well, with all their tremendous imperfections. They are human -- all too human. And, we feel for them and we celebrate them. Alexander Payne has created some of the most heartfelt films over the last decade -- "About Schmidt" and "Sideways". With "The Descendents" he has given us his most deeply felt film yet -- a film to treasure, to cry and laugh with, and to hold dear to our hearts, a film that keeps us guessing, that resonates with life's unpredictability, that ultimately celebrates life and love and family, told with warmth and wisdom and genuine insight -- the best film of 2011.

The story revolves around a family shattered by a devastating boating accident that they struggle to cope with, but non more so than Clooney.George Clooney carries the film exceptionally well with a touching portrayal of a man thrown out of his depth and desperately trying to come to terms the events unfolding around him. Suddenly he finds he has to take charge of a family that has grown completely dysfunctional as he is forced into the unfamiliar territory of being lead parent. It's a beautiful, mesmerising performance underlined by a deft comedic touch. Given the subject matter this could have been a very dour film but Clooney and and exceptional cast make this an uplifting experience against the breathtaking backdrop of the Hawaiian islands</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, 'The Descendants' is A Cinematic GEM! It's one of those HUMAN-Films, that are so true to their intentions &amp; morales. Prolific Filmmaker Alexander Payne delivers THE Finest Film of his Career in 'The Descendants'. The Performances, especially by George Clooney &amp; Shailene Woodle, are Oscar-Worthy! 'The Descendants' Synopsis: A land baron tries to re-connect with his two daughters after his wife suffers a boating accident. 'The Descendants' is about the Do's &amp; Don't's We Usually End Up Doing. It's about how a family deals with a situation this serious &amp; unexpected. The Family here, The King's, are Human, Especially the Head of The Family, Matt, played by Clooney. He is impulsive, yet he has a soul, he has a lot to say, but he doesn't really blabber. It's a film, that has everything going for it, be it believable characters, the story itself &amp; of course the execution.The Screenplay by Payne, Nat Faxon &amp; Jim Rash, is wonderfully done &amp; deserves immense praise. Payne's Direction, on the other-hand, is completely mastered. Cinematography is top-notch. Editing &amp; Art Design, are mention-worthy.Performance-Wise: Clooney &amp; Shailene Woodle are Incredible in here. Clooney is mesmerizing in his portrayal of a man who gets the shock of life. I loved the way Clooney Played Matt King, he gave him his due completely. Woodley is terrific as Clooney's elder daughter. She really surpasses herself in the emotional scenes, especially. Amara Miller is adorable as the youngest in the family of the King's. Nick Krause is first-rate. Judy Greer is impressive. Beau Bridges &amp; Matthew Lillard are effective. On the whole, 'The Descendants' is Among The Finest Films of 2011! Two Big Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty excellent, but definitely sort of odd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never really had high expectations for The Descendants. First off, I have never seen an Alexander Payne film, and the story itself sort of seemed like the type of film that would end up on a long list of solid films that end up being unmemorable. Much to my surprise, it has a sort of tone that you don't see often in these types of films.This is a film that carefully treads around the edges. I wouldn't say it ever became too sentimental. Yet I also expected a snappy dialogue- filled, fast-paced dramedy, sort of like Reitman's Up in the Air, that other Clooney film. The film is written and plays out like a real life situation. One could maybe try to say that about any film like this, but here it rings true. To say it's slow or fast paced isn't really what matters, but what matters is how much it develops its characters with real richness and detail. In a way, the screenplay is helped a lot by Payne as a director, not because the writing is thin, but because the direction allows the film to feel sort of spontaneous. This isn't a film full of twists or turns, and yet at every corner when you try to analyze it, you realize how unpredictable it all feels. I have also heard one thing about it in many reviews, and that is how it's messy like life. One can easily read those descriptions and just roll his or her eyes, but that description really holds truth. The film doesn't feel to glamorous or stylized. It certainly isn't the dramedy with witty one liners that I expected. Instead, when it's all over, you take a step back and realize that it all feels sort of messy. It's not complicated, and in fact it's a pretty simple film, but even the editing helps this certain mood that the film leaves you in. It's simple, yet hard to really pinpoint and describe how it all comes together or how it's something of real importance. This is completely refreshing, especially when films these days hammer you with these sort of messages or details.I now want to talk about the performances, which are stellar. Clooney just won the Globe a couple of hours ago, and now I look at it and think to myself "wow... of all of his performances, this is getting him awards?". It's a very restrained performance, and no, it isn't a transformation. Some will once again say that Clooney is only "playing himself", but to me, when Clooney does great, he really nails it. He gives all of his performances something distinct about them, and this is perhaps his wild-card character. He doesn't add in his usual smoothness that we see a lot from him. This stands apart, and I am surprised for that reason for its success. Shailene Woodley is fantastic here as well, and really impressed me with the sort of indignation and maturity that she mixes together. She's better than most of the contenders for the Oscar in her category, more specifically Octavia Spencer, Melissa McCarthy, and Janet McTeer.I loved this film. I wasn't sure of it while I was seeing it, but after it's over, as hard as it is to really describe and know why I enjoyed it so much, I did. The sort of atmosphere and mood that it had me in doesn't come along very often, especially not with dramas like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Clooney's most touching movie !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For weeks I've been dying to see, "The Descendants". Ever since I have seen the preview, I had an automatic attachment. So I finally see it today, and it was simply fantastic! Easily one of the greatest movies of the year and the most moving picture I have ever seen. "The Descendants" had so much passion and truth; it moved me in such a way that it's even hard to write this review. It's so hard to explain this truly visionary film in words. The movie starts off like any drama; a situation, emotionally damaged characters and a main character with some type of emotional load. The story heads into a comedy for a bit, then completely changes your sight. It slaps you with a troubling secret the husband and main character (GeorgeBs Clooney), finds out about his ailing wife. And he has to to make a decision; how to react to a wife's fault when she can't even move? The whole movie, Clooney is unfairly faced with challenge after challenge and does what most men in his position would not do; the right thing! The journey this family has to take, affects not only Clooney, but his two daughters and the rest of their family. They reconnect while learning the strange power of forgiveness, and knowing when to do the right thing.&nbsp;From the very laughable moments to the points where you can't even bare to look at the screen without crying, this movie is definitely one of the best movies of the year, make that the best movie of this generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Picture of 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants is my personal favorite film of that year because of its intricacies of emotion, humor, entertainment, characters, setting, and, most importantly, realism. Alexander Payne has officially become one of my favorite filmmakers with this work, which was preceded by his other notable works, About Schmit and Sideways. The dialogue in this film is so true and moving that it easily rivals the works of Quentin Tarantino. I also want to give credit to the best ensemble cast of year, including George Clooney, Beau Bridges, Robert Forster, Matthew Lillard, Judy Greer, the newcomer, Shailene Woodley, etc. By the way, Clooney and Woodley deserve the Oscars in their respective categories; this is the best of Clooney's performances. The story follows three different sub-plots: the permanent coma and inevitable and fast-approaching death of the wife of Matt King (Clooney) and dealing with his immediate and extended family with how to tell them and move on with life after the tragedy, the selling of the last virgin piece of Hawaiian land owned by the King family since the 1860s (hence the title: The Descendants) and of which Matt is the sole trustee, and, of course, the discovery and confrontation of the guy who was sleeping with Matt's wife. The stories go along so very seamlessly and logically that it keeps the audience absolutely enthralled until the very end. The film deals with a gravely sensitive issue: crappy parents, but, in this case, crappy moms. I'm not talking about the ones who don't provide for their children or give them enough attention; I'm talking about the ones who are quite simply bad people that are self-centered and hurt the people around them in some way all the time. As the film confirms, the children of these moms don't find out how crappy they are until they are like adults; observe the relationship between Alex (Woodley) and her mom and then observe the relationship between, or rather the perception of, that mom with the younger sister Scotty. A lot of people automatically stereotype teenagers and tend to write off their views and opinions because they suspect them of being drug-using, "dad-hating," irresponsible, sex crazed maniacs as a result of personal experience. However, even if one might be a drug-using, "dad-hating," irresponsible, sex crazed maniac, a teenager can be right and can even have a good sense of judging whether their parent is a genuinely bad person or not. Alex is definitely one of those.Aside from the crappy mom, Matt is a very good dad and, on top of that, a good person. He is an easily sympathetic and lovable protagonist, but he is seriously sad. As one of the smaller characters simply stated about Matt's situation: "it really blows," before Matt replies: "I know." Matt's problems are uniquely sh***y. Not only does he have to deal with telling all his family and friends that his wife is going to die, but he also has to deal with the process of selling what seems to be his last connection to his ancestors and Hawaii itself and to deal with some a**hole who saw his wife without his knowing about it. Matt's weakness is that he tends to go on cruise-control and eventually ends up being unaware of his situation and problems. This movie shows his revelation of those things.I love this movie because it is truly the most realistic piece of the year. It has the full range of effective and inspiring story-telling, acting, cinematography, and true "vision up the butt so just go with it" directorial and screen-writing ability from Alexander Payne and his co-writers, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash. Also, not to forget, the brilliant creator of the story and author of the novel, Kaui Hart Hemmings. I know this name only matters if Kaui reads this, which Kaui probably won't, but you never know. Also . . . this film will win the Golden Globe, but I am a little doubtful that it will the votes of the conservative members of the Academy . . . I mean it's competing with a Scorsese flick, a Spielberg epic, and a silent and black and white movie that is actually pretty good. Nevertheless, I know that The Descendants deserves to be dubbed as Best Picture of 2011 and it happens one of my personal favorite films of all time.I highly recommend that you most definitely see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paradise Lost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne bursts back onto the big screen in his book to film adaptation of The Descendants. It stars George Clooney as Matt King, a man whose family history is sort of the history of Hawaii. When a new law is passed that forces him and his remaining family to pass on their large chunk of shoreline real estate, King is faced with a major decision. To make things worse his wife is in a coma following a boating accident. The outlook isn't good, but things get even more complicated when the bombshell of an affair she had is revealed.It's a family crisis. He and his two daughters, Alexandra (Shailene Woodley), a teenager in reform school, and Scottie (Amara Miller), a young, rambunctious girl who is quickly making more enemies than friends, need to come together to help get through this ordeal. Matt needs to get in touch with family and friends to find some answers about what to do with his land, but also sneakily uncovering more about his wife's love affair. As he digs deeper, he uncovers more about himself than about anything else.Alexander Payne is drawn to male characters struggling to find themselves. Broderick in Election, Nicholson in About Schmidt, Giamatti in Sideways, and now Clooney. They all have what appears to be a clear journey, only to find obstacle after obstacle in their way. Payne also finds himself at home in the world of adaptation. I have not read any of the books that his films are based on and I'm not so sure I would ever go after them, but Payne finds a way to present these stories about self discovery in such a unique, comic light, while keeping it grounded with a good heart.This is by far his most touching and heartwarming film to date. It's not just the writing or the source material. It's the whole shebang. Acting, photography, the setting, and one kick-ass soundtrack.Clooney leads with a strong performance, jilted betrayed husband with confused father. His face holding back the emotion as long as it can. This is by far one of Clooney's more personal performances (which is saying something. He tends to give his all in his work). He is backed up by arguably the best supporting actress of the year in Woodley. Not only does she look the part but she performs her character with a certain grace. She's a loud mouthed teenager (obvious influence on her younger sister) who isn't afraid to get involved even if it hurts. Beau Bridges and Robert Forster offer small but effective performances that add some back story to CLooney and other characters, as well as moving along the plot.The music, a collaboration of island vibes from a wide assortment of artists, helps add to the illusion we mainland people have about Hawaii. We see palm trees, flowered leis, and white, sandy beaches, when the reality is it is just like any other state in the union. They have to work, raise families, and get stuck in traffic just like everyone else. Still, there is something extraordinary about the setting. I've seen plenty of films with bizarre and unorthodox locations, but there is a strange quality to Hawaii. Perhaps it was the melodious tones of the ukulele or the crashing of the waves along the shore, but there is a sense that this place is special, therein making the characters even more interesting. How can people live normal lives in this paradise? The interesting location mirrors the characters. There are as many layers to the beauty of Hawaii as there are to Matt King's inner-workings.The Descendants is touching, sometimes dark, and one of the best films of the year. It's a culmination of perfect parts meeting fascinating characters and a beautiful state. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally challenging yet revelatory film everyone can connect with</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often times a change of scenery can make a big difference. Independent filmmaking has become as inextricably tied to relationship and family drama over the years as it has to New York City, Los Angeles and generic Suburbia. So taking place in Hawaii gives "The Descendants a unique presence, not that Alexander Payne's outstanding film requires a tactical advantage. The venerated filmmaker simply understands how this setting, in all its tropical beauty and paradisiacal allure, has something important to say about this story of life's many blemishes.Matt King (George Clooney) is a lawyer and a descendant of Hawaiian royalty, as are his many cousins. A huge portion of land in Kauai has been passed down to all of them, land they ultimately must sell or give back to the state. They plan to take full advantage of their birthright and Matt is the trustee who must ultimately sign off on the sale. But Matt has been having a rough go of it lately: his wife, Elizabeth, has been in a coma for several weeks as a result of a boating accident and her prognosis grows grim. As such, he has become the primary caretaker of his 10-year-old daughter Scottie (Amara Miller). He also has a 17-year- old daughter named Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) at a rehabilitative boarding school on "the Big Island."Matt hopes he can weather the storm. He harbors some resentment with regards to being a "back-up parent" thrust into the starting lineup, but realizes his marriage had been growing cold and distant; he's gotten his wake-up call and he's ready to make things right. But when bad news from the doctor forces him to fetch Alexandra home from school, she reveals that the big fight she had with her mother before the accident was because she'd caught her having an affair.At first, Payne and Clooney paint Matt as a father with good intentions but really poor tact, but this news transforms him from a bit of a scrooge to a more pathetic individual, albeit one you have to feel a bit sorry for, especially given how his daughters, other relatives, and Alexandra's beach bum pal Sid (Nick Krause) behave around him. Although its not clear for a while whether Matt simply wants to stalk his wife's lover, confront him, get revenge or just find peace of mind, it's an undertaking you sympathize with given the waves of emotion experienced by the character.Clooney, in by far one of his very best performances if for nothing but the fact that he cannot lean on his charms, expertly embodies Matt's whirlwind. His portrayal fully demonstrates Matt as smart and rational yet emotionally feeble and sometimes volatile. As he throws on his boat shoes to run down the street and get answers from his wife's best friend and closest confidant, the awkwardness of it all comes out (most obviously in his bizarre gait). Even in life's toughest and craziest moments there's a darkly comic edge, and "The Descendants" hits on that in addition to the full range of other emotions. No doubt Payne's co-adaptors of Kaui Hart Hemmings' novel, little-known but highly recognizable character actors Nat Paxon ("Beerfest") and Jim Rash ("Community"), had a hand in the sharp wit.But the real brilliance of the writing shows in the characters. Almost every one gives us cause for dislike or even hatred at some point, but each of those characters goes through a redemptive process and surprises us. Whether it's the daughters being obnoxious, Sid not knowing his place or even Matt's father-in-law laying thick blame on Matt, somehow they all find their way into our good graces by the end, which isn't an easy feat to pull off. That's testament to how much sincerity and humanity Payne brings to the film."The Descendants" will hit close to home for many and everyone will connect somehow whether with a character or empathy for the conflict. The very nature of Elizabeth, a woman unfaithful to her husband yet in a coma and on the verge of death, challenges everything we know about right and wrong, good parenting and bad parenting ? it will awaken a change in perspective and what matters most in every person who sees it. The rest of the film and its many subplots just magnifies this, to the point that when Matt finally comes face to face with his wife's inamorato, you might be surprised at how you want it all to go down.Seeping in the cracks throughout is the Hawaiian setting. There's something about the tropical backdrop that elicits different emotions, that helps keep things in perspective when the drama ratchets up several more notches. Even something as simple as every male in the film over 20 wearing Tommy Bahama and khaki shorts enhances the story and the film's message. The beautiful Polynesian acoustic soundtrack can also not be understated in bolstering this effect.Great films reveal to us truths we've always known ? whether in our minds or deep in our hearts ? in a way that makes us feel as if we're realizing them again for the first time. "The Descendants" provides that unique light, in this case with some beaches and a few leis. Payne might have taken a long time off after "Sideways," but he came back with something more palpable, universal and undeniably great.~Steven CVisit my site! http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney dazzles in The Descendants. Whilst the story of death and coming to terms with it is morbid, Clooney, along with on-screen daughters Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller add a concoction of feelings to curb our interest. Matt (Clooney) juggles with a tough decision regarding his wife on life support, single-handedly looking after his two daughters, all the while dealing with work and other such pressing matters. Sounds like a lot of ground to cover, but in hindsight The Descendants is quite simple to grasp thanks to a well drawn out script and compassionate personnel to show it off. Clooeny has never been better, and Woodley shows off skills that's deserved bigger roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I need a stiff drink</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some wonderful sad movies. Nothing wrong with the odd tear jerker. But this film is a total downer that makes you want a stiff drink, possibly laced with a shot of strychnine. One of the saddest stories ever done is Pucinni's opera La Boheme. But it leaves you feeling enriched because there is so much more than grief and tragedy. The Descendants just left me feeling depressed. Despite being tempted to turn it off several times, I stuck with it hoping for some sort of joyful or inspiring ending. There isn't. The scenes of Hawaii, away from the clichés of Waikiki, were also most interesting. But the story was just too unhappy and the couple of feeble attempts at comic relief were totally ineffective. It's well shot and well acted. But it's just too dark and morbid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well this was super good. Funny, heartbreaking and beautifully acted. I also enjoyed the Hawaiian location which is such a big part of this movie. George Clooney is exceptional, conveying a range of subtle emotions. His character really made me laugh but broke my heart as well. Initially he does a voice-over which sets the tone and explains his mindset well; angry, frustrated and broken.Hard to find any flaws here, a beautiful, unique story, filled with great scenery, moving performances and quite a few laughs. The story's been based on a debut novel which follows Matt King, a middle aged man who, while in the middle of a (family) land deal discovers that his comatose wife was having an affair and sets off with his 2 daughters to confront her lover before she dies.Shailene Woodley plays his oldest daughter and is an absolute scene stealer, acting older than her years as she becomes 'Matt's' partner in finding and confronting Brian. I also enjoyed the boy that played her friend, hilarious and then surprising the audience with his own tragic tale. Loved the closing scene in front of the TV with moms blanket, ice-cream and 'March Of The Penguins'.The mom actually looked like a coma patient here too, all bruised, twisted up and ugly, not the soap opera version that we usually get. Several cameos; Beau Bridges, Laird Hamilton and excellent music if you like the traditional Hawaiian thing. 4/27/15</fullReview>

Solid direction by Alexander Payne, whose previous works have included great movies like Election, About Schmidt and, best of all, Sideways.Great performances all round. George Clooney deserves his Oscar nomination. Disappointing that Shailene Woodley was overlooked, as she puts in a great supporting performance.On the minor-negative side, some events in the plot seem contrived and too convenient. Plus, the movie is not really as profound as I thought it would be. In the end there are no big take-aways. Maybe that is the idea: just sit back and enjoy the human drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong, over-scored. Despite having a good cast this film disappointed me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie on TV, so I am prepared to make some allowances. I knew nothing about it until it appeared in the TV schedules. The opening few minutes hooked me. I always enjoy George Clooney's performances. He is a consummate actor, and brings class to everything he is involved with. To continue the fishing analogy: I wrote that the opening few minutes hooked me. But the film failed to reel me in. The more I watched the less I was interested in the characters. A poor little rich family struggling with issues of infidelity does not arouse much sympathy in me. The film began to resemble a travelogue: beautiful scenery, loving lingering shots of stunning landscapes. But in all honesty it could have lost 10-15 minutes without anyone noticing. I found myself looking out for Magnum PI and Higgins. Moreover the music soon became very distracting. So why did I watch to the end? I am not sure if I can answer that question. Maybe it was because of the Oscar-winning screenplay. Maybe it was out of respect for a strong cast. But all in all I was disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally barren</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I feel that the much acclaimed films of Alexander Payne are somewhat over-rated. 'Election' is funny but is also quite nasty, a sneer at those without money or special likability who nonetheless have the ambition to challenge the natural order; 'Sideways' seems to be loved by those who love its subject (namely wine), while 'About Schmidt' wins plaudits from fans of its star, Jack Nicholson. Payne's works have a certain quirkiness which arguably is simply the product of simplified characterisation, and in 'The Descendents', it's George Clooney's turn in the lead role, playing a man trying to come to terms with surprising discoveries about his comatose wife, and the fact that she is unlikely to recover. There could be an interesting story here, about a man who seems to have it all yet is forced to realise there is much that he has not understood, and will never understand. But emotions of just about every sort seem alien to Clooney's hyper-rational character: his own emotional blankness makes his incomprehension seem unsurprising and unmysterious to everyone but himself, and yet the point of the film seems rather different, painting its lead more as a put-upon hero than an emotional void. What really kills the film is its length: it's too emotionally dull to sustain itself, endless Hawaiian musical interludes notwithstanding. The movie even makes Hawaii itself seem dull, perpetually overcast and with cities comprising bland grids and skyscrapers. Perhaps that's meant to be part of the point; but the feeling of this movie was as ungraspable to me as the story within the film appears to be to its hero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(79%) A fine character based study with superb performances from a talented cast with George Clooney leading the way with a wonderful performance as a man living in paradise and going through hell. Along with Clooney, Robert Forster is great as a bitter old man, yet his bitterness is at the very least partly understandable, and that is what this gets so right in that every character is a real person with actual flaws, and both good and bad tropes interwoven into them all. It would have been easy for this to fall into a well cast TV drama movie, but it's way too well put together for that with its gentle pace, nice observations, a few good laughs, and brilliant writing. Overall it may not be a remarkable film, but it is a must watch slice of quality drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Elizabeth King is seriously injured in a boating accident her husband, Matt, is left looking after his ten year old daughter, Scottie, and things aren't going too well as he doesn't really know how to be a father. Then when the doctors inform Matt that Elizabeth is going to die he removes his elder daughter, seventeen year old Alex, from boarding school hoping she might be able to help but if anything she makes things harder? she tells him a secret about her mother that Matt never suspected; she had discovered that her mother was having an affair. Matt decides he must at least talks to the man and sets about looking for him.Matt and his family live in Hawaii on the island of Oahu where he is an attorney; he is also the trustee of 25,000 acres of pristine land on the island of Kauai and a change in the law means it must be sold within seven years; most of his cousins want him to sell it to a local developer but he is has yet to decide. It does however give him a reason to go to Kauai when he learns that his wife's lover is visiting that island.Given that this film is effectively about a man and his daughters waiting for his wife to die it is surprisingly funny; frequently laugh out loud funny. This is done in a way that is naturally amusing rather than forced situations. It is also quite touching and doesn't shy away from the promised ending to give us a 'miracle cure'. The cast do a fine job; George Clooney does great as Matt and Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller do fine jobs as Alex and Scottie. Nick Krause, who plays Alex's friend Sid, is hilarious in many of his scenes without making the character annoying? which could easily have happened. The subplot involving the land provided a nice excuse to show even more glorious Hawaiian scenery. Overall I must say this film was a real delight; the comedy and tragedy were nicely balanced and the story moved along at a gentle pace without being at all boring. The only possible criticism I can think of is that some viewers who might like the story might be offended by the swearing, of which there is quite a lot? however if that doesn't bother you I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again Clooney is called upon to save a film from becoming a sizeable flop. Throughout, he became the only character I genuinely cared for. The rest of the cast all gave fairly brain dead performances, if you can excuse the somewhat black double meaning. Apart from Clooney, the only other interesting character development comes from that of the eldest daughters boyfriend. Clooney originally takes him to be a dense and ignorant teenager. However, upon finding out that his dad died two months prior to Clooney's wife's accident, it reveals a side that makes the audience, and indeed Clooney's character, overall more understanding and sympathetic whilst also creating a sense of guilt from a false premature judgement. With a below par plot line and many things left unresolved this film deserves no more than a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual Hollywood Movie that Film "Buff's" Will Enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoy well made "real" movies that develop real human emotions and portray characters as real people; you will enjoy this movie. However, if you enjoyed canned movies with the same dialogue and hollow character development and shallow plots then you will not appreciate this movie at any level. Also, when Hollywood attempts to make a "real" film, it ends-up being political tripe or condescending film that tells you how you are supposed to feel about societal issues, and this film amazingly does not contain that Hollywood garbage.The reviews that I read (even the positive ones) neglect to understand the lead character as a person; he is recognized as a frugal workaholic, but what most loose is that he is simply a man running his life in the best manner that he can. He attempts to provide for his family without relying on his past (he is the executor of nearly a billion dollars of land that has been handed-down from several generations), he works very hard in an attempt to provide, he's honest, dedicated and truly adores what he has in his family.Does he make his wife and children feel loved on a daily basis? Is he worried that he isn't doing enough? Does he think he needs be someone else? The answer of course is no, but how many of us can admit that we are not exactly the same way? This character is very real. He attempts to lead his life in the best possible manner that he knows yet everyone around him is telling him that he did it wrong, yet each person claiming he's flawed is in fact significantly more flawed in the manner in which they handle themselves.This movie is about real people, real emotions, real human behavior, and a man at the beginning of the film believing that his ideals were wrong all along, but coming to grips through the film that he has been true to himself and his family, that each person is accountable for their own decisions, and will continue preserve in the only manner that he knows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney plays Matt King a direct descendant of one of the first families to occupy the modern nation. Though he has the blood of ancestors, his real estate holdings has made him and his family very wealthy. This becomes troublesome when he is reminded of his obligations and his responsibility. While he ponders his duty to his grandparents and his present family, he is made aware of his personal troubles which include two troublesome daughters and a wife in a coma. When he learns of his wife's infidelity, all his problems multiply. When he decides to investigate his wife's accident, his daughters come to live with him, one of which invites her new boyfriend. The movie called " The Descendants " is fraught with domestic problems as they too become a nuisance. Further, when the audience is saddled with the repetitive drone of repetitive Hawiian music. The idyllic locations are beautiful, but the audience is hardly allowed to view the natural indigenous population, as it is forever dragged about with the luggage. The complexity of the story too is toted about with the suitcases which Clooney and company forever drag from place to place. To say the least, this movie is not one of Clooney's best and often we ask why the star ever accepted this role. Were it not for the rest of the cast members which include Nick Krause as Sid, Beau Bridges as Cousin Hugh and Robert Forester, the film would have failed from its true purpose. As is stands, this film is far from recommended. **</fullReview>

He has attached himself to his late father's maxim that you should live within your means and leave just enough to enable your children to make their own way in life. What happens when this man gradually discovers that his unquestioned trust in those closest to him is misplaced, his little family is falling apart, his nasty bullish father-in-law is preserving an illusion, his larger family are mostly spendthrift self-seeking opportunists and he has to do something about it? George Clooney does a reasonably good job of portraying the narrator although he doesn't possess the acting range to do the part justice ? he looks a bit vacant most of the time. He is ably supported by the two girls but the boyfriend was out of place. The ending of this morality tale was predictable and satisfying although the sacrifices made were relatively minimal - nothing in this movie was life threatening, it was all about trust, loyalty and finding contentment in what you have. As a global citizen I fear for what we're doing to the environment. I assume that the cinematography was not intended to be stunning. I know plenty of places in the British Isles that bear comparison to the scenery in the Hawaiian Islands. If we had the same weather, we might have more high risers ? maybe it's a blessing in disguise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is one thing to have a bunch of juveniles cursing in a movie, but when the adult who is supposed to guide these adolescents (one pre-teen, another mid-teen) starts acting like a High School aged kid himself is where I begin to draw the line in today's "modern" cinema.I started off loving this family drama where busy dad George Clooney finds out the sad truth about his comatose wife from their foul-mouthed teenaged daughter who wouldn't know respect if it hopped up on her surfboard in their lush Hawaiian home. The fact that Clooney didn't even make an attempt to discipline her in front of the young (and equally crude) daughter made him seem like a real wimp, the place where the fault for these kid's behavior lies. Yes, I think he had every right to know the truth about his wife's infidelities as she lies brain dead in a hospital room with only days left to physically live. But the way he handles it with confronting the other man is something so immature it seemed like something I would have seen in my ultra-clicky high school. Cursing certainly does not offend me when it has a purpose but here, it seems that the only purpose it has is to show today's troubled youth that it is OK to swear in anger at your parents and to curse your comatose mother without really understanding why things happened the way they did. The script expects the audience to give the family sympathy within their bad behavior no matter how justified it seems.If anything good came out of all of this it was the calm after the storm where forgiveness takes over all the immature actions up until that point. But taking the old adage "Children should be seen and not heard" and moving it into the opposite extreme I think is a bad precedent to take. In this era where the media is showing children in a dysfunctional light, attempting to make the decisions in the families and blaming their parents for everything, the film is doing a disservice to families who are trying to instill old fashioned values with (un)common sense. I would hope that after Clooney resolves these dysfunctional issues, he gets his kids into cursing anonymous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that well known movie reviewers rate this movie highly---is a bit of a worry. I am told this is a message movie. Look closely and you can see all these deep messages. Well...it does have a couple of meaningless points...but nothing you wouldn't have known when you were 10 years old. I must say, George Clooneys acting is his finest---ever. The Descendants is like Little Miss Sunshine...on Valium. The humour is so well hidden, only a well trained blood-hound would get it. I try never to use the word "boring" in my reviews...but this is boring...for long periods. Its been seven years since director Alexander Payne made the fine Sideways. All directors make mediocre movies...this is one of Mr. Paynes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Descendants" is a light drama that follows the style of "The Kids Are All Right"-- not that the plot is the same or anything, but the way it runs. Matt King (George Clooney) is about to lose his wife when he discovers she's been cheating on him, which delivers some funny moments. Alex (his daughter) is a bad humored teenager initially, but as the film goes she shows she has maturity. Although this story doesn't bring anything new to the genre and nothing much really happens, this movie is great in character development and entertainment. Most scenes are slow but you get interested in the story, which makes time flies. All the cast is professional and I don't understand why so many bad reviews towards Clooney's acting. All in all, this is a good family comedy with few drama moments with a simple yet beautiful last scene-- family reunited in the sofa sharing the same blanket and food.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Friends on the mainland think that living in Hawaii must be like living in Paradise?.Well Paradise can go f--k itself." These are the words of a guy who is having a really bad time in a really beautiful place. Matt King (George Clooney) is a well-to-do lawyer whose wife is in a terminal coma after a boating accident. Their daughters Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) and Scottie (Amara Miller) are both acting out, and then Matt receives the bombshell that prior to the accident his wife had been having an affair and had planned to ask for a divorce. Meanwhile, Matt is the hereditary, legal trustee of a large, extremely valuable hunk of Hawaiian beachfront. He and his cousins are all heirs, but he has legal control of the property, and changes to the law have made it necessary for them to sell the place.Watching Matt sort through all this should be more interesting than it is. The setup of a failing marriage being interrupted by a coma provides rich emotional grist, and Clooney does an okay job portraying the complex emotions, but the script makes a mockery of the situation. Matt winds up stalking the real-estate agent with whom his wife was cheating, even following the guy to a different island. I'm not saying that no one would ever do that, but I don't think that an intelligent, contained lawyer like Matt King would do something so stupid and useless. Then the way they have Matt handle the land sale feels very perfunctory and arbitrary. Finally, the goodbye scene between Matt and his comatose wife is pure dreck, mostly ruining the rest of the movie for me. There are a couple of bright spots. Shailene Woodley has gotten a lot of hype, and deservedly so. She is a beautiful and talented actress and holds her own quite well against George Clooney. Robert Forster is quite convincing as Matt's asshole father-in-law. His character is not really likable, but the way he handles his grief is convincing. "The Descendants" also has an important social message in its discussion of advanced medical directives. These are legal papers that someone prepares detailing what their wishes would be should they ever be severely ill or in a coma, including the conditions under which they would want to be removed from life support. The decision to withdraw care from Matt's wife is made much easier for the family because she had an advanced directive. This is a good message for people to hear. I wish it could be presented in a better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clooney the cuckold, Clooney the dad, Clooney the double Oscar winner?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You'll have heard much about this already I'm sure because, firstly, it stars George Clooney, who can do no wrong on film (overlooking Combat Academy and Return of the Killer Tomatoes), and secondly, he's hotly tipped to win his second Oscar.If you're looking for Clooney the sex symbol, turn back now. What The Descendants gives us is Matt King, a Clooney character who can't run, can't relate to his daughters and is struggling to deal with his comatose wife who is not recovering from a boating accident. Throw in the issue that she was cheating on him and his life on Hawaii and the hundred's of millions of dollars of prime land he's inherited in paradise counts for nothing.As King states early on, "Paradise? F*** paradise!" Multi award-winning writer &amp; director Alexander Payne, renowned for Sideways, exceeds even the excellence of About Schmidt with a thoughtful, reality-based film about relationships, forgiveness and the resourcefulness of the human spirit. As with the afore mentioned About Schmidt, he refrains from throwing obvious stereotypes at the screen and hoping they'll entertain. Instead he presents a man who, when he thinks he has a second chance, prepares to make amends only to have it snatched away. King's relationship with his daughters is not tense in the obvious sense; there's been no great clash, he just doesn't understand them. But in spite of this and the abuse they hurl at him, he remains thoughtful, understanding and forgiving. Even faced with friends who knew about his wife's impropriety, he remains, well, thoroughly decent. He's a man you'd want on your side simply because he's a good man.The Descendants is an emotional film, that is to say it's not a roller-coaster or a film that induces extremes of emotions but it does require the viewer to have a level of humanity and embrace their meandering emotions. The characters evolve, certainly, but Payne unfolds in a way that it's our understanding of them that evolves. Take the elder daughter's boyfriend, Sid. He seemed to be plonked into the film for light comedic relief that failed with me; I just wanted to punch him. Repeatedly. But as the film rolled along, his character unfurled and he proved to be as real, as flawed and as rounded as the best of the roles Payne has written.Even the man who cuckolded King, played by Mathew Lilliard in a welcome return to the big screen, is complete enough to regard without obvious judgment. In another film he'd have been presented as the callous lothario we love to hate but The Descendants isn't another film. This is Payne showing that each of us makes mistakes, each of us is flawed and each of us has some redeeming features.It's obvious to say Clooney is the star but in reality, it's an ensemble piece with the principle star being the sensitivity of the screenplay and direction. It's funny, but it's not a comedy; it's dark, but not black; it's sad, but it's not maudlin. It's an extremely good film that requires a viewing tonight and at least another on DVD on a cold Sunday afternoon on front of the fire. And no buts.Another film review from The Squiss.

		<shortDescription>A film about a guy who finds out his dieing wife was cheating on him.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Descendants" is about re-connecting with your loved ones. In the film the main character has no clue of what his family is up to and when he does find out he doesn't know how to react because he was never there. Another element of the film is family and how we need them to get through our tough times. We might be annoyed with them or we even might hate them, but when it truly comes down to it, they will be the first to stand up. The last major theme the film targets is forgiveness. We need to learn to forgive and move on with out lives. If we linger in the past we can never move forward and we'll constantly beating ourselves up over it.The directing is pretty solid in the film. The director, Alexander Payne, captures the feel of Hawaii, the setting of the film. He doesn't make it look like some tropical island that is isolated from the mayhem of the real world. It gives us the viewer a real take of this island so many of us think is untouched by man. The cinematography only adds to the experience. While the director is portraying the realness of the island, it never forgets that this place still is very beautiful. Writing is top notch. The things the characters say are real and in the situation they are in would be very normal. They use some profane language, which usually turns me off certain movies, but they use it effectively and with viable reason and not just for shock. The overall film is wholesome and sweet. It doesn't get cynical or tries to copy what is popular, it is just pure wholesome bliss of pure storytelling.The acting is really good as well. George Clooney give a marvelous performance and probably the best of last year (haven't seem "The Artist"). His wife is about to die in the film, but he finds out that she was cheating on him. You can see that he really loves her and wanted things to work out and he regrets not giving her enough attention. However, you can also see his frustration and helplessness on the whole situation. Another stand out is Shailene Woodley, who is also frustrated with her mother, but upon hearing of her situation she too becomes frustrated and helpless. She goes toe to toe with Clooney and their chemistry is really good. They feel like a real father and daughter, they joke, tease, and feel each other's pain. I really like how their relationship develops throughout the film.Overall, "The Descendants" is a really good film. It is storytelling at its highest order. The relationships are genuine and the way the director manages to capture the overall bliss of Hawaii is great. I love how they don't linger on melodrama and play off the mother's situation to get a reaction from its viewers. It is funny, heart warming, and a fun ride of enough emotional depth. Another noteworthy part of the film is its score, which is fantastic. Very subtle and gives the right amount of feel for Hawaii. I give it 5/5, great storytelling accompanied by fantastic performances, and enough wholesome entertainment."Awesomeness"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alexander Payne got my Oscar vote</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'My friends on the mainland think just because I live in Hawaii, I live in paradise' says Matt King (George Clooney) in some of the first lines of the movie. And just as it proceeds to unravel the story about a man, who traverses through the magnificent Hawaiian grounds in order to challenge his problems and finally accept his better feelings, we gradually realize that the so-called paradise might have been long lost.Alexander Payne is a specialist in making movies about men, who embark on a journey deep into their own minds, just to clarify their own emotions and feelings, and get ahold of the issues that have been troubling them.The Descendants is yet another one of his masterpieces, definitely deserving all the rave reviews and Oscar nods (it's a pity that it didn't get more statues though).The aforementioned Matt King is a descendant of one of the first white people inhabiting Hawaii's islands. His wife Elizabeth just had a boating accident and is in a coma, without any close chances of waking up. He is also struggling with the thoughts of selling the huge amounts of acres of land that he inherited. Of course, along come some legal issues. And if this wasn't enough, he finds out that his wife was cheating on him for some time. What is there to do? Matt has to find an ultimate solution to all of his ensuing problems, the one that will solve all of them with just one sufficient answer.The road towards that goal is long and winding. He has to take care of his two daughters, who actually don't seem to be too fond of him and have a few issues of their own. He has to deal with the remaining members of the family (namely the irritating cousins), who, possessed by greed, are ready to sell the land right this minute. He has the great pleasure of meeting the man, with whom Elizabeth was having an affair, and his ostentatious wife Julia.Matt has to go through many difficulties and sacrifices in order to find a way to a possible happy ending. It's there, I might tell you, but everything in-between isn't in any way connected to the notion of a light-hearted tale. Quite the contrary. And Alexander Payne definitely got the right man to do the job. George Clooney is able to create a character of flesh and bones, the one that the viewer may find the most convincing. In his performance he shows that all of Matt's problems are really his problems too, and he can relate to them in such a way, that makes this role one of the best in his entire career.I should also mention that Shailene Woodley is brilliant as Alexandra, Matt's older daughter, who has a bit of a drinking problem and a slow-witted boyfriend on her hands. In the process, she transforms from a child into a woman, being clearly the intelligent girl that she deserves to be. She provides the needed support when her father is near a breakdown. The Descendants is definitely one of the most interesting movies of 2011, because with its moving tale it's able to absorb the viewer's attention and make him think and reminisce about his own life experiences. Matt King has finally found an answer to what's been ailing him, and through his bizarre, yet sad, adventures everyone can learn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Whom the Archipelago Tolls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the not-so-endearing reviews on this page, I went to see this movie, and I was quite amazed. (Let me add that I watched it in German, but as far as I can tell, the synch was as good as they come.)This movie sets the tone for what it is about in its very opening line, and in my opinion, holds true to that throughout. It is definitely unique in its impressionistic approach, and that is what some might consider "boring" or "overdone". To me, it is staying true to the overall idea of a man awakening to his surroundings just when they seem to be talking to him the least.It has been said here that the editing were "poor". I do think that the editing is, indeed, a bit over-accentuated, but that goes well with the overall impressionist idea. The same holds true for lighting and music, which are a bit "do-you-get-my-drift"-ish, but that's okay, because, yes, I DO. There is a certain idea to be conveyed, and I don't mind having it hammered home to me in this particular case, because it is done respectfully and without any moralistic conclusiveness.Everything in this movie breathes the ambiguity of the protagonist's situation, and in doing that, speaks loudly to me, personally. Whatever you might think of this flick, you got to admit that it does its best to be a work of art as well as artisanry, and that's more than enough of a recommendation as far as I'm concerned.And finally, we can now riposte when some clever-dick tells us that "No Man is an Island" ... that, "Yes, but behold: Every Family is an Archipelago."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not the blue Hawaii I was expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is blue, but not the blue Hawaii I was expecting to see and yet was beautiful just the same. Instead of focusing on the majesty of the lush tropical scenery the film focuses on the absurdity of mans existence and the self absorbed lost way people go through life. I was also a big fan of the historical subtext running thorough the film. It made me want to go back to Hawaii.Yeah this certainly isn't the beautiful tropical Hawaii sort of film you would expect going in. I also had not seen Clooney play someone so adrift and troubled previously. I enjoyed the way the director made the Islands feel so melancholy as a physical manifestation of Matt King's depression and soul searching.check out our full review at 3guys1movie.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gulf Between and Mastery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants was written and directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways, About Schmidt) with Clooney in his most masterful performance, deserving to defeat Dujardin's silent romp. The story is smooth but not necessarily polite, detailing the wavy family dynamics of a grieving clan.Though the two daughters are excellently played by a pair of talented young actresses, the real leading woman is Hawaii. While dealing with his comatose wife, Matt (Clooney) is also deciding whether or not to sell a large piece of inherited island property, enduring pressure from his cousins who are seeking to cash in. The Descendants uses the paradise for contrast. Matt even says in voice-over at the very beginning, "paradise can go f**k itself." Indeed it does! The film walks the common contemporary line between tragedy and comedy, often seeking progress in visual contradiction and dramatic irony. Inside of these universes, everything does seem to be lined up for one character or family. In a way, they are becoming more Movie by trying to become less Movie, if you catch my drift.But Descendants tries to understand more than that. We are allowed to inherit Matt's difficulties and indecisions. No character gets a free pass. Even Sid, the bum tagalong, and Elizabeth's father, the closest thing to total opposition, are given moments of earnest explanation. The people who populate this island habitat are imbued with the completion that other movies aren't able to find. It doesn't stop at the notion that the human experience is both comedy and tragedy, it actually builds that duality into each character, no matter how marginal. When everyone says "Elizabeth is a fighter. She'll make it." we are allowed to see their error and their effort. The film doesn't only let us in on the joke.Some of the best scenes are ones that sit in the gulf between our public selves and our private selves. The two big revelations about Elizabeth's affair (one involving Alex and the other Mr. Speer) have so much energy and construct an exciting amount of audience instability. The scene at the Speer house is a twisty counterpoint involving the characters x 2 ? the public self and the private self. It rolls to a gentle but uncomfortable climax and stands up to most any great scene in recent memory.Clooney's crinkled brow is just tired enough to never let us doubt his ability to pull through everything. In living through him, we are allowed to flirt with those moments of feeling that the movies can sometimes concoct. The Descendants is populated by complex, thoughtful characters and situations that feel so close and familiar even in these extraordinary circumstances.85.0</fullReview>

Maybe it wasn't what the others expected, but it hit the 'bullseye' with me. The script was well-written and believable and that's all I ask when I view a movie. This movie did not insult my intelligence and everything that happened in it made sense. George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and the young ladies playing his daughters were a revelation. It was a treat to see some other actors like Beau Bridges and Judy Greer. They always make a pleasant addition to any movie.

		<fullReview>When a mother is dying on films, there's always a warning flag and you often have to have a heart of stone not to laugh about the standard sentimentality. Here a mother is dying, but that's not the main point. How does a family cope with themselves? The dying just starts a process outside.George Clooney finds out from his oldest daughter that the wife has been cheating on him. He goes around Hawaii with his daughters and the boyfriend of one of them to get himself deeper and deeper into some truth. Truth is sometimes very painful, but he seeks the pain too.The script is all right, but you're not really involved. You're just the watcher, but without sentimentality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive balancing act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Are we supposed to laugh or not? Are some of the scenes in The Descendants meant to be funny or dramatic? The answer is: they are both. That's the strong point about this movie: it deals with serious issues like death, adultery and raising children, but never in a heavy- handed way. The subject of the movie - a man trying to deal with his teenage daughters and a difficult business decision while his wife is dying in hospital - could give you the impression that The Descendants is a heavy movie. It is not. There are many funny moments in The Descendants, but the humour is subtle and with sharp edges.The location of the movie intensifies the contrasts: in the paradise-like landscape of Hawaii we see George Clooney's character being confronted with one set-back after the other. His wife is in coma, his daughters are rebellious and don't accept their father's authority, his family members are pressing him to sign the sale of the family land, and as if that's not enough he also learns that his wife has been cheating on him. Clooney is superb in showing subtle emotions. He's never overacting or showing off. Anyone who doubts if he's one of Hollywood's greatest actors, is proved wrong by this performance, one of his best ever. Without any effort, he pulls off the difficult balancing act of grieving husband, loving father and respected businessman who's completely in control. Just as the whole film balances nicely between different emotions: you can laugh, be touched and feel angry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can safely say that George Clooney is quickly becoming, in terms of acting, this generations Cary Grant. He delivers a brilliant performance in the Descendants as a distracted and distant father and husband forced to deal with a family crisis. The movie itself does an amazing job of mixing the events of a family in an emotional crisis with lighthearted touches. You will laugh and cry. The wonder of this movie is that it does not try hard to accomplish any of this. It feels genuine through out. Keep a close eye on George's facial expressions as he struggles to deal with his families situation - they are worth the price of admission alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What does it make you think about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is for people who have already seen the flick.For me it was of interest because it was about people, and they were presented so we could see what they were all about. Knowing that George Clooney may get the Oscar tonight for best actor, I was watching him closely and missed what was so special about his acting. Doesn't the actor follow the direction of the script and the Director? I like George Clooney and he played his part. Is that what the Oscar is for; voting for your favorite actor? I liked all the actors in this movie; Sid, the daughter's take-along boyfriend, was an interesting character. So was Clooney's wife. Or should I give credit to the make-up artist? After all, she didn't have any spoken lines.So everybody was a good actor; what did they make me think about? Most of all, why would people talk out loud to a comatose woman; ie. a breathing corpse? Does that appeal to the religious? To me it's like talking to the sky (praying). What's the purpose? Nobody is listening.Next I wonder, why do people let a sex fling spoil their lives? Isn't that a religious thing as well? Some couples who are not so uptight attend sex clubs and swap partners. Some couples have their separate flings and then get back together. Why? Because they like each other's company.Some people 'cheat' because they are dissatisfied with their marriage but don't want the hassle of ending it. There are children to consider, estates to divide, moving to do. That, we are told, was Clooney's wife's situation before her accident. We are told he wasn't so thrilled with her any more either. So why didn't he find a good time gal occasionally, at least until the kids grew up? I don't know much about the history of marriage but I'll bet it has to do with the Church. Jealousy was invented before movies came along, but movies have not done anything in helping people realize that variety is the spice of life. A movie needs a conflict to make it watchable. There's plenty of conflicts in this soap opera. All of them unnecessary. Still it's a good movie. Not one gun fired and I don't recall anybody smoking either (although Sid did say he's always got weed).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite of the Oscar nominees for BP ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By favorite I mean the film I most see myself watching again out of the Best Picture nominees. The best film that I saw in 2011 (or 2012 at the end of the Oscar season) was the Artist. That should, and probably will, win Best Picture. I think that George Clooney should take Best Actor though. It's 1 and 1A as far as I'm concerned, Jean Dujardin was phenomenal, but I think, and we're splitting hairs here, he was helped by both the uniqueness of the film and Berenice Bejo who is for lack of a better word, radiant, in that film. Clooney carries this film from start to finish. His performance is understated, funny, real. Overall, this film has fantastic performances by an ensemble cast including Nick Krause, who is great as Sid. I didn't feel that anything seemed forced (save maybe Speer's wife appearing in the end), although it addressed subject matter that could lend itself easily to being forced. I think Clooney deserves to pull an upset, in my opinion perhaps his best performance in an already stellar career. Regardless, this is a wonderful film that had me hooked from the very first scene. I would highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant performances mixed with a nice story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the Artist in New York, I thought I had seen the best of the best of the Best Picture nominations. When I returned home from my vacation, the Descendants was playing at my local theater. I had been excited for this movie ever since I saw the first trailer, and the first chance I got, I went and bought a ticket and went to see the movie. I was completely satisfied with the movie, but I also got a little more then I had expected. I had heard of Alexander Payne's works, and I had seen the first half hour of About Schmidt.George Clooney, in an Oscar-worthy performance (in my opinion), stars as Matt King, a land baron. After his wife suffers from a boating accident, leaving her in a coma. Matt is left to take care of his two daughters by himself, and he has no clue, calling himself the "backup parent." Along with Clooney, Shailene Woodley, Amara Miller, and Nick Krause co-star, and without them this movie would not have been what it was. Some pretty unknown names are good for movies like this. I loved their performances.I expected this movie to be sad or devastating, and it was. But there was also some very funny moments in it, and sometimes it was even combined. There's also a lot of family in it, and I wasn't expecting that, but the way the family aspect of the whole movie makes it work, and I loved the way Payne pulled that off. The acting was top-notch, and the characters that were in the situations were believable, and that helped me be able to connect with the characters and feel their emotion.Apart from Clooney's performance, I think Woodley and Miller's performances stole the show. This is Woodley's first movie role, and this is Miller's first ever role. I loved Woodley's character in this, and the way she pulls off all the emotional scenes is enough to make you just love her. The way her character develops from a little brat, to a caring daughter is amazing. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie. All of the performances make the movie spectacular.I don't know what I can say about this movie, other then what I already have. It's just a nice movie, very endearing, and you leave the theater with a smile on your face. Despite all of the devastating scenes in the movie, you leave satisfied and happy with the way things wrap up at the end. Go see this movie five times, and you'll still smile every time you see it. Highly recommended from yours truly.Perfect 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To give Clooney best actor nomination status is a little absurd!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'THE DESCENDANTS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Alexander Payne (the man behind such critically acclaimed films as 'SIDEWAYS', 'ELECTION' and 'ABOUT SCHMIDT') co-wrote and directed this George Clooney starring comedy drama (which is yet another Oscar contender for best picture, as well as several others including nominations for Payne and Clooney). The film is about a lawyer who finds out his comatose wife was cheating on him. It's a pretty even mix of laughs and emotion, like all of Payne's films, and for the most part is a pretty effective and well done film. Clooney is decent in the lead role but far from Oscar worthy.Clooney plays Matt King, the sole trustee of a family land trust on the island of Kauai. His family, and he, have decided to sell the land for development due to the fact that they'll lose control of it in seven years because of the rule against perpetuities. Matt's wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) recently suffered a boating accident that left her in a coma and will soon be cut off from life support due to her living will. Matt decides to spend some time with his two daughters (Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller), who he's spent little time with recently, as the three inform other family and friends of Patricia's passing. Matt is also hit with the news that Patricia cheated on him, by his eldest daughter, which throws his world into an even bigger whirlwind.The movie has enough big laughs to keep the film fast moving and entertaining and the drama is very poignant and touching at times. This is a film that definitely deserves the notice and recognition it's been receiving, all except for Clooney (in my opinion). He's definitely not a bad actor he's just not a very good actor either. He does almost always basically play himself and his range of emotions are very limited. Here his talents do fit the necessity of the role but to give him best actor nomination status for it is a little absurd.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEXQWgWt6cw</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Clooney As The Ultimate Mensch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants was a pleasant surprise. As a series of character studies, the cast rises above what could have been a fairly pedestrian tale of loss and discovery (in other words, the movie that you expect to see after viewing the trailer). George Clooney plays a fellow (Matt King) trying his best to be a nice guy in the face of conflict. His portrayal as a man trapped between doing the right thing and the thing he wants to do is the central theme of the movie played out against the backdrops of business, family and death. The supporting cast was excellent as a collection of family and friends caught in much of the same dilemma as Matt, but coming to terms with it in far different ways. Special mention to the ever interesting Robert Forster and Beau Bridges (and those decadent eyebrows).A special word about the King family. The trailer would leave us to believe that the two children are spoiled rotten offspring. In fact, they love their father and rally to his support when needed. Even the elder daughter's stoner boyfriend ends up as an important aspect of Matt's trip to resolve his "dilemma".Finally, a word about George Clooney's award-nominated performance. Mr. Clooney is that odd kind of actor that everyone knows gives good performances, but that is probably discounted because he is a bit too cute. Perhaps that is why we're so comfortable with him blowing things up and being a tongue-in-cheek tough guy in the movies. In this film, he showed the torment and conflict of his character clearly and simply, without flourish and flash and the result was satisfying in the extreme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best emotional realistic family movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that makes the movie so amazing is how refreshingly human it is as a whole. Every character is so flawed, in the sense that makes every one of us human. It is very real and you can relate to it. With the highs and lows, the good days and the bad days, it is a wonderful family movie which simply comes as a puzzle with few missing pieces. The characters in the movie are extremely relatable and everyone is exposed in a way that makes you feel you are a part of the family. But who's family is'not it??Matt King (George Clooney) is your average father living in Hawaii who never had to fill his position as a father in his entire life. His wife is recently put into a coma after a freak boat accident and so he had to take this responsibility of taking care of his 2 daughters. And on top of this, clooney is facing pressure from his cousins to sell some property that his family has owned for centuries to construct some big resort. In the beginning Clooney comments on how Hawaii is not a paradise and people living on this island do have problems like us who lives in God's own country. As the film progresses it becomes a treat to see how Clooney own his role while going through all these situations and handle them well. His character is so mature and well etched. We will witness him trying to hold his family together but barely keeping a grip on himself. Every conversation and interaction is done in such a way that you may not be able to predict what he will do next. And the scene where he runs a few blocks in sandals is one of my favorite scene . Shailene Woodley, who plays his daughter's role really delivers in every scene she is in. The underwater crying scene after knowing her mom's critical condition marks my another favorite scene. The shock, deep hurt, tears?everything was included in it, that scene is something hard to swallow without feeling an emotional punch to the chest. The younger daughter too did a great job, the scene were she breaks down after hearing that her mom is going to die show cases the kids acting skills. Another best part of the movie is the background music, it is so soothing to ear. And the scenery too is great.There is so much emotion and humor in the movie which is truly necessary to convey the message. It is better to jump into the film and go along with the family without knowing what would be the next thing that life throws their way. Although the tears may sneak up on you, the laughter and smiles will help you recover it. It's a movie of a normal man who is just having a bad month and comes out of it as a better man. It's an entertaining film depending on your definition of entertainment. And it really shows how precious life is.So Leave everyday you're alive :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So What - a movie to sleep through!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To an oldie like myself, part of this movie felt like a modern sequel to two James Michener adaptations in the Sixties - 'Hawaii' (about the first missionaries from US to Hawaii) and 'Diamond Head' (about the next generation who headed the annexation of Hawaii for the US) - with the family descendants of those first missionaries grappling with the sale of land bequeathed to them by the last King of Hawaii. But that plot line barely gets a look in and is perfunctory at best. Parallel to this 'letting go' is the personal issue for George Clooney and his two daughters of 'letting go' of his wife/their mother who has been brain damaged in a boating accident. Personal and Societal running along with each other to some form of redemption - geddit?? Unfortunately both parts of the story are boring, uninvolving, and almost fake in its attempts to create emotional grip. The direction is lacklustre and Payne does not seem interested in the content. The script is downbeat, tedious and plain awful. The characterisation across the board is done by numbers and would disgrace a soap. While the acting - even the phone company would not ordinarily let people phone these in! from a few minutes in, I just thought 'So what?' and this was my final thought as redemption was reached with a totally corny Clooney eulogy. Hopelessly poor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No substance, only filling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This had some positive reviews, but that must be (a) the reviewers saw the name Alexander Payne, and didn't bother to watch it or (b) they were severely intoxicated when watching (perhaps on booze supplied by the studio). There is maybe a decent 15-minute short film in this, but it is mostly bulk filling: pretty pictures from Hawaii with an annoying musical score behind it. For each micro-moment of actual action propelling the story forward were about ten minutes of picturesque Hawaiian landscapes or establishing shots of Clooney walking forlornly on beaches. How this film managed to get a screen-writing Oscar is beyond my comprehension. If you are not into Hawaiian style music, the score may also make you want to hurt yourself with whatever implement you find handy. Sadly, the sofa is not good for this. I just wanted to abandon it, but my boyfriend kept watching, as he said "waiting for the comedy to start". Well, it never did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really don't get the hype of this movie. It was totally predictable and left me pretty much untouched (and I'm pretty sentimental). Thought the acting was fine enough but the storyline was just not very interesting. I like Clooney and think a lot of what he's done recently is good but the reaction to this movie makes me wonder if people just automatically love everything the guy touches. I kept thinking the whole movie that the people behind it seemed to think how profound it all was while to me it was really just one cliché after another. The girls playing the daughters did a good job though, and the wife's parents (the dad at the hospital was the one time I found it somewhat touching; he may have been pretty mean previously but there you could see that he was really just in such grief and you could sympathize).But yeah, overall, a disappointing shrug of the shoulders kinda movie, luckily I just watched on a plane and it did its job to pass the time, but not much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely the worst movie of the year!! I've seen it today in the movie theater and I deeply regret the two precious hours of my life I wasted on such a meaningless and unbearably boring drama. I kept turning and fidgeting in my seat wondering when this nightmare is ever going to end. The Oscars critics must have gone mad or blind to give The Descendants five Oscar nominations.Poor story. Lousy plot. Monotonous script. Spirit-less direction. Nondescript performance. There, I summed the movie up to you. No need to see it yourself.I have read many reviews before I go and watch it, and I have seen how people and critics described it as the definition of brilliance. I'm sorry guys, call me a fool but I just can't see your point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Charming Film of Life &amp; Relationships</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely LOVED this movie! It was so refreshing to see a film about life and relationships. We're so inundated with unnecessary violence,foul language and sex scenes in movies these days that it made a wonderful change to view a film which explored the lives of people, ordinary people who could have been my neighbours or family.This is a great ensemble cast with every member turning in an understated, considered and nuanced performance just right for each character. As with life, this film contains sadness, comedy, frustration, patience, wisdom, stupidity, greed, generosity, revenge, jealousy,graciousness, empathy and grief. The characters feel very real with all the merits and flaws of real people. Each one is allowed to develop a roundness of personality too often missing in modern films. This is not a fast paced movie but a gentle journey through the complexities of family relationships, in life and death.If you're a fan of hard-hitting action films then this isn't for you but if you enjoy merging with a film's characters as the tapestry of life is revealed, then you'll love this movie. I can't wait to see it again. And again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An oceanic paradise of cathartic waves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seen from afar, the paradisiacal waters and gold-covered sands of an otherworldly heaven on earth create a mirage of lukewarm bliss and ever-extending fortune. Such an ambrosial sight is rapidly washed away as the "The Descendants" submerges us into an exquisitely constructed wave of asphyxiating familial complications, frosting aches of dealing with unthinkable losses and mind-swirling decisions that will forever change the course of an entire line of generations. Amidst this flooding of intense emotions, however, shines a series of invigorating rays of warm comedy to lighten the moments of hardship. In the beautifully spoken words of Matt King (George Clooney), "A family feels exactly like an archipelago. Separate but part of a whole and always slowly drifting apart." Witnessing this character gather superhuman forces to avert such a separation is an ambiguously elating yet a painfully strenuous process. Furthermore, the film is blessed by a breath-taking confluence of talented actors- to accentuate are George Clooney and Shailene Woodley's individually outstanding yet altogether compatible performances. In sum, "The Descendants" is a magnificently gripping analysis that guarantees a raw and convincing experience of both victory and vexation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intense is an understatement ? this was brutal. Don't get me wrong, it's totally worth it.I think at some point almost everyone is faced with the reality that someone we trusted has betrayed us. How one handles heartbreak can make or break them? and those around them ? if they succumb to the power of anger or a need to seek revenge. It's amazing when you're somehow able to rise above pain and bitterness to find even a shred of positivity in something that seemed nothing but destructive. It's a gift. Jealousy, infidelity and betrayal can crush your soul if you let it. This is a raw look at a scenario that I have no trouble imagining. The often used phrase, "What doesn't kill us makes us stronger," has definitely rung true for me, but it sure is hell to go through the time it can take to reveal a positive impact. Handling the negative part is exhausting, but there always seems to be something significant about the good that ultimately outweighs the bad.In a nutshell, I think it's important to try to forgive what is impossible to forget. Who you are today is a result of what you've experienced. It's up to you to choose the effect it has on you to the best of your ability at the time.No matter how you react, you must make amends and/or forgive yourself for whatever happened during an extremely stressful period in your life. And you have to work hard to forgive. There is yin and yang, balance, karma, good and bad ? and ultimately there is justice even though you may never realize it. If you're fortunate, you gain an understanding and acceptance than impels you to carry on with a constructive mindset.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meet the kings...Matt a lawyer who happens to be the custodian of a large Trustfund too. Daughter Alexandra tucked away to a private school on another Hawaiian island. Daughter Scotty, who has problems with school-friends and mum Elisabeth, who just had a terrible boating accident and is left in a coma in the hospital. They were not particularly happy during the last period. Matt hopes to make it up to Elisabeth after her recovery. Or maybe he just hopes her to recover so she can care for the girls again. It has been ages since he's had to handle his daughters and he doesn't have a clue, he is facing a severe crisis and, at the same time has to deal with his wife departure and his family. He finds out the hard way that his wife had an affair and sets out to find the guy so he can say goodbye to Elisabeth who's dying as well On this quest his daughters and his eldest daughter's friend Sid join him. In the hands of a less capable director and actors this could have easily become very cheesy. It's nothing even close. It's a family-portrait and this family is not like the Ingalls or the Waltons. They swear, they hurt each other. They are not particularly nice..still during the search for his wife's lover Matt and his kids manage to get a little closer... Still at the end of the movie anything could just as easily go wrong in a second...but oddly that seems OK...The viewer is left with the strong feeling that in the end it will be alright.... It's a drama yes, but with light touches and you do not leave the cinema complex feeling depressed. You do leave completely in awe of this movie and you are going to want to see it again....I promise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Oscar worthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this for multiple reasons and knew that it was a drama about a man dealing with his family. The script and the director do a good job of pacing this kind of movie. The trouble with this is it makes this story almost boring; at the least it's plodding. This movie is really a vehicle for Clooney. Unfortunately he is playing a role very similar to his character in Up in the Air; an emotionally detached person with suddenly too much on his plate. His performance is fair, but I found it lacking. His shell never really cracks and events of the magnitude he is going through should have cracked it, hard. The better performance is by Shailene Woodley. Her character shows a growth into maturity. Overall the story has too many loose ends and bits, the performances are nothing we haven't seen before, the direction is measured and stock. A 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trouble in Paradise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was always going to be difficult for Alexander Payne to equal 'Sideways', his splendid 2004 film about finding oneself through a wine-tasting road trip. Its perfect balance of ingredients ? humour, pathos, neuroses - made it taste just right. With 'The Descendants', Payne proves he has lost none of his wit. It's a warm, bittersweet, intelligent drama-comedy, which I think should receive at least some of the five Oscars it's up for. All of this is pretty remarkable considering the plot revolves around a living corpse. Clooney's character complains that life in Hawaii is not as paradisiacal as we all think. He has this depressing attitude because a boating accident leaves his wife in a coma, leaving him to look after his two rebellious daughters. This wouldn't be so tragic if it wasn't for the fact that he has never quite taken to fatherhood. His time is spent managing his law practice and acting as lynchpin for his wider family. He's the head trustee of the land that has been handed down to him through several generations. With his family's consent, he plans to sell it all off to make way for corporations to run roughshod over it. But it all means megabucks for the family, so why the hell not? What we have, then, is a series of a quotidian man's quandaries which are all smartly resolved at the conclusion. The supporting cast, comprising new and familiar faces, all do something to create a community ambiance. Beau Bridges' unintentional parody of his brother's immortal Dude is funny, as is Robert Forster's turn as Clooney's mildly cantankerous father-in-law. The pathos is brought out with a harmonious Hawaiian score, which is still in my head as I write this. If you like laughing and appreciate an intelligent but uncomplicated story, I recommend this film to you.www.moseleyb13.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthwhile film that deals with a very difficult life event with no easy answers on tap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't have high expectations of this film despite having read really good reviews. The trailer didn't seem all that interesting and I think that's because it's impossible to adequately convey the slow unfolding of such a story within a film short. One of the things I really liked about this film was the slow, real time story telling. There are quite a lot of scenes of the father just walking around streets and beaches with his daughters. I've seen it criticized for being 'ordinary' but that's what I loved - the ordinariness of the characters, the lush scenery and slow, slow, laid back Polynesian way of life.My main criticism is that it's so hard to forget who George Clooney is but think he did an admirable job in this role of displaying a range of emotions; particularly his struggles with his daughters as the 'supporting actor' parent suddenly thrust into the driver's seat and having to forge his way ahead with them.The other themes of family connections, ancestral roots and guardianship of pristine land resonate throughout the movie. Time meanders along and is spent looking at old family portraits, meeting family in cafés, viewing the gorgeous land to be sold, and listening Polynesian music as well as trying to cope with an ever worsening situation regarding Elisabeth ? the girls' mother. Dealing with an inevitable death (established early in the film) and individual ways of saying goodbye to someone are handled sensitively. The actors playing the daughters do a terrific job as young people trying to cope with a very difficult event in their lives. It's funny, non-sentimental, sad and thought provoking story that has many layers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The descendant" is one movie that shows that Hollywood at its best holds up against the best of them in world cinema. It recently won Golden Globe Best Picture in the "drama" category while Ebert quips "technically, it's a comedy". The best way to describe it is: it's an Alexander Payne film. Those who have seen his "About Schmidt" (2002) and "Sideways" (2004) would agree. Nobody can bring about a marriage of sobering life drama and witty comedy better than Payne.The first thing you'll notice in "The descendants" is it's easy (but in no way casual) narrative style, exemplified in the very first shots (and consistently throughout the rest of the movie): first a 10-second sequence (including close-up) of Elizabeth King (Patricia Hastis) enjoying a speed boat ride and then, after the opening credits, a penning shot showing her lying in the coma in a hospital bed. Bridging these two shots is voice over of her husband Matt (George Clooney) used very effectively in this and ensuing establishing scenes provide all the necessary details for the enjoyment of this movie. And enjoy you will.There are three main plot lines along which the story moves. In his titular role (albeit singular), with a great-great-great (may a couple more "greats") grandmother as a royal Hawaiian princess, Matt finds himself (no details given or necessary) the only person in a trust with execution power to sell a piece of family property for lucrative profits sufficient to make a whole army of relatively happy (especially those in financial trouble) while he, a believer in thrift, lives quite comfortably on income from his law practice. Whether to sell is therefore less of a personal issue than the conflict between the two camps ? the aforementioned relative and the locals more concerned with preservation of environment and heritage.Both the other two plot lines pertain to Elizabeth the dying wife. The difficulty facing this "backup parent, the understudy" coping with the 10-year-old younger daughter Scottie (Amara Miller) with her mother in a coma is soon dwarfed when sad news comes form the doctor that there is no hope of recovery and foresight-endowed Elizabeth has left legal documents authorizing pulling the plug to allow her to die in dignity. In desperation, Matt tries to reunite this "archipelago of a family" (both literally and figuratively) by bringing back 17-year-old Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) from an expensive boarding school in Kauai. The immediate task is to arrange for Elizabeth's relatives and friends to come to say a personal goodbye at the hospital. The longer-term challenge is how the surviving members of this dysfunctional family should carry on: two angry, rebellious daughters and a hitherto negligent father.The third of these plot lines is what makes this movie unique. When Alexandra drops a bombshell that her mothers has been cheating on Matt, the tale takes on a different spin as the father, daughters and a tag-along boyfriend Cid (Nick Krause) goes on an island-hopping quest to seek out this family wrecker whom Matt has never met. Enough of plot lines. To tell more would spoil the fun. Did I say fun? It seems heartless to build a comedy on such tragic circumstances and yet the injection of the anger changes things. As well, there's a lot of truth in what someone (could be Bernard Shaw, I'm not sure) once said that a person simply cannot be in a sad (or happy, for that matter) mode day after day. After the poignancy sinks in, other emotions can surface. Director cum scriptwriter (plus two others) Payne has done a superb job in developing his material (due credit should also be given to Kaui Hart Hemmings, author of the novel from which the movie has been adopted).The beauty of this movie is, among other things, the fine line it takes between caricature drawing and character development with depth ? so skilfully done that you can never tell which is which. One key thing to watch for is how the characters react to a revelation. There are far too many examples to draw from. A good one is when Matt learns about Elizabeth's affair, where George Clooney demonstrates how eloquent body language can be. Another is the father-in-law's (Robert Forster) reaction to his precious daughter's imminent death, pitch-perfect in terms of being real-life. There is also the cinematic elegance of Alexandra's reaction when Matt tells her that her mother is not going to make it. I can go on for several pages. Another thing to watch for is all the brief, very brief nuances of facial expressions from all the characters, many just in split seconds before a scene ends. They are not haphazard, but meticulously engineered. It seems inconsistent to say that George Clooney shines in this Golden Globe (and probably Oscar, deservedly) winning performance and this is also a marvellous ensemble piece. But that is what it is. Clooney's glow doesn't eclipse everybody else's but, on the contrary, illuminates them. Among many examples, the scene of the midnight talk between Matt and Cid is the best (and Nick Krause is such a scene stealer). Woodley's double Best Supporting nomination (Golden Global and Critics' Choice) is well deserved even though she didn't win. Of the rest of the excellent support cast, one that deserves particular mention is Judy Greer playing Elizabeth's secret lover's wife (and looking remarkably like Shirley Jones). One character that could have been acted out, through flashbacks, is Elizabeth (what we actually see is just the 10-second opening mentioned) but that may come across as too crafty in a movie of this calibre. Seeing her in life my thrown some light on many unanswered questions, which however may have been left deliberately unanswered by the movie makers. The movie does not make a moral judgment on the entanglements of this dysfunctional family. That is not the point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good emotional drama that proves secrets and life can be painful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Alexander Payne is well known for his emotional drama as he always highlights and exposes life as tough drama that when dealing with family and loved ones it's always an emotional struggle and when secrets are uncovered life seems more painful. This picture "The Descendants" fits all of those descriptions, plus it's filled with plenty of laughs, tension and drama to hold viewer interest. And it has the star power with the man himself Mr. George, and a sassy direct performance from newcomer Shailene Woodley.Set in the Hawaiian islands it centers around Matt King(George Clooney)a well to do lawyer and land baron who's hit with a midlife drama his wife Elizabeth has just recently been placed in a coma on life support due to a boating accident, to complicate matters with his upcoming land sales are the parenting of his two teenage daughters. Both are scene treats the young and innocent Scottie(Amara Miller)is a delight to listen speak her young wisdom, and somewhat of an eye candy treat is watching oldest daughter Alexandra(Shailene Woodley)talk with direct and straight approach she's certainly got spunk and get up! Along the way the trio will have to come to terms about what is the right thing to do about mom and Matt will have to think again about his real estate deal especially when a hurtful secret is revealed that involves his wife Elizabeth.Overall this film is a great drama of pain, sorrow, hurt, and regret it's an emotional journey that proves in life one will have to deal with painful secrets and work thru their problems by love and by bonding with love ones. Proving in the end that those choices can be made by sticking with tradition, as that will let all be happy and at peace.</fullReview>

This powerful drama stars George Clooney as a man whose wife is in an accident that puts her in a coma - he then is put into a split life of tending to their two rebellious kids and a business decision that could change their lives forever. Shailene Woodley plays a brilliant role as Alex - one of the children, for me she carried the film remarkably well considering this is her first big screen performance. Clooney also plays a good role but I think not Oscar winning, however, we will have to wait and see. The storey is a complete roller-coaster ride of emotion that has a few lighter moments which ease you for a short while but through you back into the turmoil very quickly and without remorse.. This is a gripping and emotional movie from beginning to end and is certainly not your average Hollywood plot - which is good.. Change is good but this even rises about that.. Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the multiple narrative threads dealing at a microscopic emotional level - trying hard to come to terms with a cheating spouse where you know you've drawn the shortest possible end of the stick given the state of the other half, and having a teenage daughter who doesn't quite understand you, they provide that grounding to make it easy to identify with Matt King the man who's really quite down on his luck on family matters. The plot threads expand to his near obsession to want to discover with whom his wife has been cheating with, and to bear the brunt of an incessantly sarcastic father-in-law who doesn't take her daughter's comatose state all too kindly.But it's not all doom, gloom and filled with negative emotions here, as the film does have its fair share of lighter moments courtesy of characters like Alexandra's insensitive loud mouthed friend Sid (Nick Krause) who comes along for the road trip of sorts, though almost always punctuated with that tinge of inevitable sadness in the air. Moments of poetic justice also makes you want to whoop for joy, although you tend to weigh in on these moments and make you think - would you want to maximize benefits for those in your family, or for selfish reasons choose not to remotely reward someone who had done you a great wrong. Such is the tussle and wrangle Matt has to deal with, and makes The Descendants one really topsy- turvy emotional ride, which on one hand one wants to appear magnanimous, while on the other having to suppress the urge to just punch out.And Clooney deserves his award for making Matt King so believable, junking his glamorous self for something far more affable at first, before the problems start to pile, each with a deadline of its own, and wondering when he would crack under undue pressure, emotionally and physically. Sharing perfect daughter-father relationship chemistry with Clooney is Shailene Woodley who in my opinion is an up and coming young actress to look out for, showcasing a wide range of emotions here, and a scene which I thought brought out her best when her character got broken the news of her mom's condition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful story, but just not quite good enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants is a very touching story about a lawyer and a father named Matt King (Clooney) who is forced into a variety of difficult situations when his wife is in a boating accident. With his wife dying, he is forced to get to know his two daughters, Alexandra and Scottie (Woodley and Miller, respectively) and cope with the fact that his wife had been unfaithful to him. Another dimension is added to the story when we learn at the beginning of the film that Matt is part Hawaiian and that he is the trustee of some ancestral land on the island of Kauai, that used to belong to Queen Liliuokalani.This film plays out very well as we see Matt slowly embracing his paternal role while Alexandra is able to slowly become more mature and fulfill her role as big sister to Scottie. Both Clooney and Woodley do an excellent job playing their roles. Clooney is very convincing as an upper middle class father who is out of touch with his family, while Woodley's performance as a fragile teenager who finds conflict amidst her own personal problems and the issues that the family is going through.However, in some way this film falls a bit short of greatness, because it sets up a few dimensions for the story that are never fulfilled or even discussed. For example, in the beginning of the story, Alexandra is introduced as an out-of-control teen who has a drug problem. When she comes home from boarding school, she tells her father that her condition is improving, after which we never hear about her problem again. In addition, at the beginning, we see that Scottie is having problems with the other children in school and that she is having trouble expressing herself and the loss that she is going through due to pending loss of her mother. We do not really see this develop in any way, and in the end, we just see her crying over the loss, which is supposed to indicate that she has finally found a way to let her feelings out. In that sense, I felt a little short changed by the end. The final flaw in this film is the addition of the character, Sid (Krause). Sid serves little to no purpose in this film. He is in no way a dynamic character, nor does he serve to help any of the other characters develop. At the beginning, he simply appears as Alexandra's immature love interest and from that point on, he is just strung along for the ride.Overall, I feel this film was good but that it doesn't live up to the hype and praise that it has been receiving. It's nice to see once, but that's about it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get all the praise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie was beyond bad. Perhaps if it hadn't been so hyped I wouldn't feel this way, but it was hyped and it is at the very least a poorly written movie in that the dialog was all over the place and throwing in comedy line simply didn't work. The entire movie didn't seem to flow. Secondly, the casting was strange. The teenage boy who played Alex's friend was really mis-cast and the writer missed a big opportunity with his role as he had recently lost a parent. It certainly would have been nice to have that fact tied in more than it was. Some of the minor actors were very bad, so that I had to wonder who they were related to, and even the younger daughter was so into herself as an actress it was glaring. I had no idea why Beau Bridges was in it as he stood out too much in the group of cousins, not to mention he looked like a bum. Judy Greer's insipid voice and her overly written final scene made here character end up annoying. Finally I couldn't see any thing about George Clooney's performance that was at all good other than he basically can basically act, especially when Viggo Mortensen's performance in 'A Dangerous Method' was beyond measure, and he didn't even get nominated. What's going on? Has this turned into a popularity contest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite engaging and affecting despite being too polished and a bit too easy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't quite sure what to make of this film before I came to it; the awards season always sees films over-praised ? good ones are great ones, great ones are perfect ones and so on, so it is best to try and ignore that the best you can. Doing so, I have to say that I was a little disappointed with The Descendants because it left me a little cold despite engaging and slightly moving me throughout the two hour running time. The film follows a man coming to terms with becoming the main parent to his two daughters as well as learning that his wife, currently on life-support, was cheating on him and planning to leave him. With them in tow he sets out to find the other half of this unfaithful relationship, all the time while a large land deal looms on the horizon.The telling of this tale is very patience and very slight ? it avoids big emotional confrontation and it seems to have a sense of realism often because of the sense of restraint it has. However in the most part it is almost too restrained because it starts to come over as less than a mature and adult approach and more of a very polished and stage-managed soap-opera that is professionally aiming for its audience. The drama is a bit too easy in the way it unfolds and mostly I was left watching interested to see where it goes but not really feeling as much for the characters as I wanted to. There is still something in here but i wonder if most of it was in the performances rather than anything else. Payne has always been a very light touch with his story telling but this was too slight for me and it rarely seemed to do much.I liked Clooney in it a lot, he played well against type and I thought his presence was a big part of this film getting the love that it has. Woodley and Miller work very well alongside him as his children and their natural performances allow Clooney to do the same with them. Krause, Bridges, Forster and others are all solid in smaller supporting roles, but the heart of the film such as it is, is in the three lead roles of the family. The construct of the film seemed to push me away a lot more than I thought it should ? the quirky music, the lingering shots and when the close-ups and intimate moments come there just seemed to be too much in the way of polish and preparation to them to really move me so much as slightly touch me.So is The Descendants any good? Well, slightly. I appreciated the slow, patient pace to it (as opposed to screaming melodrama, but I found it was almost too slight and polished throughout. It was quite engaging and a little affecting but a lot of that is to do with the performances rather than the film as a whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well done....but not exactly Best Picture Oscar material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the last several years, there have been a lot more Best Picture nominees at the Oscars due to a rule change. While at first I thought this would be a good thing, I now see it as a mistake because many exceptional films are getting nominated--though they are not of the same caliber as the rest of the nominees. "The Descendants" is such a film--very good but also clearly not in the same league as films like "Hugo" and "The Artist". BUT, and this is important, it still is a very good film and I strongly recommend it. George Clooney was very good in the film and I do feel that this performance deserved a nomination. He did a fine job playing an odd sort of guy--a guy who seemed totally lost and a bit inept--and a bit of a departure for him.This film begins with a woman on life support. She's not going to recover and death is inevitable. Her husband (Clooney) suddenly is thrust into a new role--one he should have been in all along. But, he worked hard and like many men knew nothing about actually nurturing his family. This man now is sort of like a mother AND father and has to provide support for his kids--kids who apparently have been having problems long before the accident. Oddly, however, despite this being a very serious topic, the film, at times, is a bit comical in how it handles this--much like real life. I liked this and it kept the film from being relentlessly depressing. So, having the oldest daughter dating an idiot and some of the odd light moments helped keep my interest--much more than a typical 'tragedy' film.I could say more about the plot but won't. I knew about the BIG twist in the film but know that many out there don't. I liked the twist, as it made the story much more cloudy--it wasn't just a matter of a woman dying and the family being left to grieve. And, some of the friends and extended family were complicated and not especially nice--much like real life. Overall, an excellent film--and one well worth your time. Just don't expect that it is brilliant--nor did it have to be. For what it is, it's quite good.</fullReview>

People only act this way in Hollywiood movies where some sort of "deep" meaning is suggested.Scenes are contrived around what is supposed to be intelligent and serious dialog pay offs.Obvious and pure twaddle.George Clooney trots out his grim face to show us all he's being a serious dramatic actor. Facts of Life is calling George, you're way over rated and so is this film.The characters and plot line in this teleplay were so unappealing and completely outside the realm of possibility, I actually felt like I had to bathe after watching this nasty bit of cinema.An hour could be edited out of this trip to celluloid hell and never be missed.Two stars for the photography.Phony, overwrought plotting, unsympathetic and unredeemable characters, hateful,sleazy unbelievable premise and resolution..... A wretched experience and time I will never get back again.What a waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's made a career out of casting a gimlet eye on the foibles of flawed middle class folks, and while he might have seemed a bit condescending toward them, you empathized with them or even loved them.Ironically, with Clooney's 1-percenter lead, Payne seems to have gone to great lengths to portray his most likable protagonist thus far, yet I feel nothing.Clooney spends the movie trying to resolve being cuckolded while he drags his two daughters and a stoner boyfriend along for the ride. Shouldn't he be helping his kids cope with their loss? Truth be told, they don't seem all that broken up about it. Nor does he, although he's obsessed with being cheated on. In fact the only person who registers what feels like appropriate grief is father-in-law Robert Forster. His performance stands out because of it.Clooney's character is remote. He can barely stand to hug his kids when they find out mom's doomed. When stoner boy reveals a horribly painful fact, Clooney's a wax dummy. And Clooney does not do sorrow well. So you have this melodramatic set-up about the most tragic of circumstances, and the lead actor plays it like a wooden Indian. I understand that was the point. It just didn't work is all. He's plenty invested in his personal tragedy, though. He gets most worked up in his therapeutic monologues with his comatose wife. As he goes through anger, repentance, and acceptance, we are supposed to think he has accomplished something. I didn't. Another character also exorcises demons over top the vegged-out wife. That poor woman. (Although, from what we hear about her in the script, she's not supposed to be very likable.) At the end, Clooney shows he has grown to the point where he can stand to sit on the same couch with his kids and eat ice cream. I can appreciate understatement and all, but it's not enough. Ask the younger one if she wants to go camping next week or something. Anything. I would be remiss without adding that the voice-over and on-the-nose expository dialogue in the first third of the film were also below Payne's usually high standards. I guess every director has a misfire eventually.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I imagine that the only folks who could relate to a film like this are hostile men who promote a negative view of women. If a female a character is not a somehow a villain whose antagonizing this holier-than-though rich male character, then she is using hateful gender-based name calling to express her anger toward another female. I suspect the writer of this movie script is seething with resentment toward women and hiding behind movie characters as a means to get his woman-hating message across that woman are no good.The two selfish daughter character creations in the story seem to have an absolutely outlandish level of apathy for the circumstance that they discover their mother in. And the father, who also seems not to care about his wife much, seems only to bond with the idiotic socially inept teenage boy character who is depicted in one scene to possess the only wisdom that Clooney's character can find. Basically, here's the theme- man good, woman evil.Do not be fooled by the cover picture or trailer for this film. It is not sentimental, heart warming, or touching in any way. It is about a rich white man who copes with irritating females as he island hops around Hawaii trying to convince himself that he's smarter and of higher social and morale aptitude than those he encounters, both male and female. That existence of the wife character serves no other purpose besides serving as a contrast against which Clooney's character can proudly compare himself and shine brightly.Also there was a real weird scene in the beginning involving a good looking blond male character who, from the writer's perspective, deserved a bad attitude for expressing his empathy to Clooney's character. I didn't get that angle of thought. I think the script writer is a little off in the head and probably has social aptitude issues himself.And to boot, its just dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll only like it because you're excited to see it due to the hype others (in your same situation) have made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would rate this with a mere 1 star, but I thought the boyfriend played an excellent integral part (integral only because without him I wouldn't have laughed once).I'll come back to this, but for now, since I'm at work, all I've got to say is that there is NO glimpse of any sort of climax, not even a build up of any sort. The conflicts that arise seem to simply resolve themselves in a matter of seconds with no consequences for any party involved.If anyone remembers the horror that was Burn After Reading, (I wouldn't be surprised if no one remembers it) you'll agree it is just as pointless of a film. One other reviewer said "good not great" and I can agree. The acting was fine, but how well can someone act out a meaningless role? The answer is: as well as someone can add 2+2 and get 4. I'm sure there are ways to mess that up, but in the end you don't get anything stunning, you just get what you expect.The fact that this film has so much hype (and will probably be close, if not win, the Oscar) is a testament to the massive amount of "followers" we have in our society. The inability to distinguish our own feelings from the feelings of those around us while we watch a film (or do anything, for that matter) ~cough~ Twilight ~cough~ makes this film a masterpiece... sadly, nothing about the film does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The contrast of contents and the environment is unique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is such a warm touching story that you can appreciate the importance of your family. A family is living in Hawai but is in an unstable circumstance. A mother is barely escaped from the accident but is about to be dead, and as for their children, they are defiant and rebellious to their parents. A father is desperate to fix it up in order to build a healthy family again. I think it is clever that the the story is set in Hawai. Unlike the uneasy mood in the story caused by the complicated family struggle, the environment where they live is extremely peaceful and tranquil. It is able to curve the tense of the family. Mild weather, beautiful sea and easy-going sub-characters effectively contribute to make the audience soothed. Moreover, it is splendid that the family are repairing their relationship little by little in response to the death of a mother. Even though death is a negative aspect in the story, you can consider it as something that can bring them together. To sum up, it is a serious topic to carry out, but you can accept them with the soft mood in Hawai.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first I wasn't planning to see The Descendants but my mum and granny saw it and thought it was really good. So when I eventually watched it, I was amazed how good it was! I mean the plot may be nothing special but it's the acting is what makes me want to watch this movie again and again. And I also like it because people can relate to this movie if they have problems with their families or having to make decisions in life.I haven't seen many of George Clooney's movies and I know a lot of people love him but a lot of other people seem to hate him, but I think his performance as a struggling father/husband and businessman was done superbly. Shailene Woodley did very well in this as well as Matt King's troublesome and difficult daughter and I can see why she received a Golden Globe nomination. But I kind of feel she should've also got an Oscar nomination if Clooney got one for this movie. And her beauty matches her talent. Even Amara Miller and Nick Krause were good even though they weren't as much involved, but they added most of the humour to this movie seeing how this movie is a comedy/drama. I even enjoyed Matthew Lillard and Judy Greer even though they were just in a few scenes but both gave strong performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film About Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants is a great portrayal of family. It shows it in a realistic way with the sort of characters you recognize in your own family. It is at times not the prettiest picture but one that rings true. The very name ?The Descendants" might seem puzzling at first but it is basically the theme of the film. This is a film about what we leave behind and to whom. Our legacy, in other words.For me the most interesting thing in this movie was the relationship between Matt (George Clooney) and Alexandra (Shailene Woodley). They play the roles of absent father and rebellious daughter. They fight one another while both try to protect the younger sister Scottie from the harsher facts of life.Besides the family drama Matt also has land/money drama. He and his relatives are about to sell land that has been theirs for many generations. Matt is originally for it, but at the very last moment he refuses to sign the papers. He then gives a great speech about how it is not theirs to sell, it was entrusted to them. It was a great moment, but all the time I kept thinking ? is there a more selfish reason for this? We had previously learned that his wife's lover would greatly benefit from this sale so is his secret motive to screw the guy over? It kind of ruined a great moment.But overall The Descendants is a solid drama film which I enjoyed watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Descendants" stars George Clooney as Matt King, a Honolulu-based attorney and descendant of local monarchs. When King discovers that his dying wife is having an affair, he assembles his daughters (Amara Miller and Shailene Woodley) and embarks upon an impromptu road-trip. His mission? Find out who his wife was cheating with, and why."The Descendants" climaxes with King preserving 25000 acres of Hawaiian real-estate. With this gesture, King hopes to atone for his failures as a husband and father. More than this, King hopes to atone for the sins of his descendants ? various European settlers and Hawaiian royals ? whose actions and values not only negatively affected Hawaii, but splintered and infected the King family itself. Ironically ? or fittingly ? for a film about alienation within families and the alienation which exists between rich expats and middle/lower class locals, "The Descendants" largely ignores non-white Hawaiians.Directed by Alexander Payne, "The Descendants" is entertaining, subtly funny, boasts pleasantly photogenic locales and mostly avoids clichés. Like all of Payne's films, it manages to be simultaneously caustic and conventionally sentimental, Payne's themes of grief, loss and betrayal leavened by dollops of comedy. Beau Bridges co-stars.8/10 - For a more substantial take on this material, see the remarkable "Frozen River", "The Swimmer" and the interesting-but-didactic "Sunshine State".</fullReview>

The side plot presented so very early at the beginning really makes the finale rather predictable after the main conflict is revealed just right after Alex' return. The movie spirals down into more of a detective movie than a family drama for some time and then it hit jackpot by the lucky pass by at the beach.Then the whole clashes of conflicts sets in right after all those neatly built main and sub plot. The acting is great in overall for me. George CLooney nicely depicted the combination of a distressed and estranged father, saddened and disappointed yet still determined husband, and the enigmatic decision maker at the end. Shailene Woodley acted out her grown up too soon role well, that her father sometimes cooperate with to have the tracking of Speer easier.</fullReview>

It is a great film that deals, not with the wife in the coma, or necessarily the grief, but the implications of this to her family. The wife, of the Matt King (George Clooney's character) is involved with a motorboat accident and is in a coma. Her family is told that she will never recover so Matt embarks on a journey to tell his eldest daughter they are letting her mother go. The eldest daughter is rebellious and dislikes her mother, as she knows of her mother's affair with another man. Matt decides that if her mother loved this other man, and he loved her, he should be able to say goodbye. The film questions the conflict between the daughter's hatred of her mother and forgiveness and forgiveness of the mother's affair and letting her lover say goodbye. Great film, but not as deep as is could be.</fullReview>

His wife Elizabeth is in a coma in the hospital following a boating accident. He struggles to deal with his daughters Scottie and Alexandra as, as he calls it, he is the "back up parent". Matt is also in control of a family trust. The trust owns a huge tract of land - aggressively sought by developers - the sale of which would be of great help financially to many of his broke cousins.George Clooney is superb, this is one of my favourite performances from him. I don't think anything will top my top 2 George Clooney performances "From Dusk Till Dawn" and "O' Brother Where Art Tho". I'm a fan of both his acting and directing. I even liked his Bruce Wayne. Not his Batman!! But his Bruce Wayne. Who better than charismatic gorgeous George Clooney to play a rich charismatic playboy?Whilst Clooney carries most if the movie on his shoulders, all of the cast do a fine job especially Beau Bridges, Robert Forster, Shailene Woodley (I what should be a breakout role) and Amara Miller is superb in her first role.One of my main problems with "The Descendants" (and this really is nit picking) is it exists in a world where George Clooney's wife would cheat on him with Shaggy from "Scooby Do". Alexander Payne (whose work I first noticed on "Citizen Ruth) does a great job of directing his own script. Clooney deservedly won the Golden Globe for his performance here, and I believe he should have won the Oscar ahead of Jean Dujardin for "The Artist". Time will show the Academy got that one wrong. I think Woodley and Miller should have bright futures in the business.</fullReview>

Matt king character has a crises of his own after realizing that someone he loves had a accident and realizes that his daughters are not what he thought they were and looks to find away back into there lives and bring his family back together and find the guy who broke his family up seek justice plus a beautifully looking shots of Hawaii with land at offer will he sell paradise or keep his family inheritance for family make his money or look after his family, and without the proper guidance it needed, along with Payne's own confidant direction, it could have faltered. Thankfully, it balances out heavy themes and complicated emotions in uncommon detail.The characters in this movie are many, complicated, and sorrowful in their own unique ways. He keeps his composure, but we can still see a very heavy, filtered sorrow beneath the surface. Shailene Woodley's character (Woodley, by the way, gives one of the year's best performances)and her boyfriend in the film is slow and say what he thinks those getting into strop this is one of the lighter parts of a dark tone of the film begins with a rebellious, even angry sadness, but we can see her develop over the course of the film, gaining a strong maturity beyond her years. Judy Greer and Robert Forster are each given a few spare scenes, and they make every second of their screen time count. 7/10 and this is my 35 film review</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Written with humour, this is surely wicked fun and is just good.The laughs come out naturally at times, even though there is a tragic meaning to it. Infidelity and death have been blended with humour. More or less I was hooked and at times just waiting to laugh again. The title, the outlook and the trailer were serious, but it took me by surprise when I went through the first 15 minutes of it. Was not able to comprehend a few scenes in first place, like George Clooney running just to find out who that man was, he could have gone in car and found out too but even his desperation was shown well. It wasn't at all serious but it was not funny either. The movie had to balance between tears and smiles and it just did well. Written well by Kaui Hert Hemmings and directed superbly by Alexander Payne, this story brought out the psychology of a middle aged man, who is going through a crisis. It's at times tough even to empathize, as it is a weird scenario that he has been in. All the director does is puts up an effective screenplay and shows us only important scenes. George Clooney does a god job and so did others. I am happy to have seen this.My Rating is 3/5. Its good for sure, but I can't say it's a must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Descendants" is a humorous, heartfelt, and emotional story about family.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Family struggles are the most natural part of family. Without tension how else would you as a team grow? Some family's like in Alexander Payne's "The Descendants' really have struggles and tension. Picture being George Clooney's relatable character named Matt King; his wife is on her death bed after a serious boating accident, his two daughters have behavioral issues and have no respect for him at all and finds out his wife had been cheating on him before the accident. Matt is raveled by the news he hears from his oldest daughter Alexandra who is ill-cast as Shailene Woodley, an absolutely unlikable character with hardly any ties to the strength of this film. Matt's youngest daughter Scottie is very irritating and sometimes makes it hard to feel compassionate about her character. George Clooney however is exuberant as a mid-life crisis faced dad with a tough life. Even though he lives in Hawaii, he is faced with loosing his family's connection and intimacy as well as struggling to find his place in the world. Matt King and his daughters go out to search for the man Matt's wife was cheating on, as they travel through Hawaii and visit many relatives. The utterly realistic drama faced by these characters and the situations that seem like they would be forced in most films are directed superbly by Alexander Payne who uses great character development and emotions to make you connect with each character spiritually and emotionally. The connections between people and how we interact with each other as family members are examined and analyzed as to how we can all fight with each other, but in the end are still family. Alexander Payne creates a story that any other film-maker could possibly do too much with and use fake mayhem to add humor or even use too much drama. Payne perfectly gives us a powerful, yet heartfelt story that most people would probably do. The minute you find out your spouse was cheating on you would drive you crazy, and some people like Matt King would go the extra mile to find the cheater. "The Descendants' shines in using powerful scenes with the mothers condition and sometimes even gets hilarious in scenes with Alexandra's boyfriend. Family is an important issue, and "The Descendants" shows us how family can change us is different ways and the importance it has in finding fulfillment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alexander Payne does not direct movies for me.Much like Wes Anderson's work, I appreciate the look, about 25% of the humor and the smart writing. I also applaud the directors for having a distinct visual style to their films.After The Descendants I feel the same way I did after watching Nebraska; somewhat disappointed, pretty bored, and uninspired.What's good about this movie is it's subtle, but it's a long wait and a lot of Hawaiian soundtrack in between each nuance. I think more of the humor is supposed to hit home.George Clooney's the best part. This is at least his second time in the starring role where the movie opens with his voice-over. Up in the Air is another.Payne's clearly a fan of reversals and double reversals. He likes to build a swell of emotion, rinse it away with a wave of disappointment, and then provide a glimmer of hope through an unexpected and unprecedented character's behavior.For example, in Nebraska, against all odds, Will Forte finds Bruce Dern's dentures lost in abandoned train tracks. When he shows them to his father, Dern claims they don't belong to him. Eventually, grabbing them, he says, "Of course they're my teeth." Up until that moment, we're given no hint Dern's character has a sense of humor. A similar exchange takes place when they steal the wrong air compressor.This type of character interaction recurs throughout The Descendants. For example, Alex's friend Sid (played by Nick Krause) seems like an oblivious moron. He says something inappropriate to Matt, causing him to pull over the car.Matt: (to Alex) Your friend is completely retarded, you know that?Sid: Hey man, I've got a little brother who's retarded. Don't use that word in derogatory fashion. Matt: Oh.Sid: (laughing) Psych! No I don't have a retarded brother.Ultimately, I come out of these moments feeling disappointed and unfulfilled. Sure the exchange catches me off guard but that jolt seems to be the end to the means. It happens four or five times. I guess that and the stilted humor are what I essentially disagree with. The shocking reversals and muted humor don't add up to a great film. (Despite such potential in the story's framework.)Krause turns in a solid performance as well, but the scene in which he laughs at 'Tu-Tu' feels off.The character of Scottie (played by Amara Miller) is painful. It reminds me of how I feel about Abigail Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine, another quirkedy with an annoying little girl. I don't understand the appeal in these types of characters.When Scottie flicks off the well-meaning guy in the restaurant, is that supposed to be funny? The 'twat' scene, the cursing and stupidity? When she's wearing her sister's lingerie and dancing poolside? When they have the conversation about the sand in her bikini top?Are all of those moments supposed to make us laugh? They're neither funny nor cute and detract greatly from the overall film.Look. I know every feminist shakes her head at me and replies with some dismissive comment like, "Oh just get over it," or "Well then look forward to parenthood buddy." But my criticism is the exact same as it was after Moonrise Kingdom (a Wes Anderson film ironically enough):It does the male audience a great disservice by having an excess of screen time featuring scantily clad little girls.Not because of some gross proclivity.It's the same aversion I feel to images of male genitalia. Every second it remains on screen, I cringe into the seat cushion a little bit further.And I only bring up this natural feeling of discomfort because I think that's what Payne's trying to 'challenge' (so to speak, I'm using that word loosely). Or he thinks she's adorable and funny. Either way, I don't think anything is gained through Scottie's character.It's illustrative of a pattern I've recognized in A. Payne's recent filmography. Going back to the reversals thing, he likes to have women in the polar extremes of age exploring sexual and explicit themes. Just like June Squibb, an older woman, pulling up her skirt in front of some guy's tombstone. She's rubbing it in the dead guy's face that he never got inside her pants. I find that scene morbid and off-putting; not empowering, insightful or worthy of a chuckle.There's a beautiful camera shot down a set of hospital stairs, while Matt's voice-over speaks above the sound of his ascending footsteps. He is heading to find out his wife must be taken off the machines and will soon die.And the entire movie is a series of sequences; a number of character interactions where others talk down to Matt about his choices. Like the staircase, they can only watch from above, and patronize.Except the kids, all other characters condescend to Matt, are inconsiderate of his feelings and pride themselves for praising his comatose wife in comparison. It's mostly a despicable lot he encounters.And yet he keeps his mouth shut. Towards the end, we see a tiny victory in this choice.But this 'glimmer in the darkness' doesn't distill the discomforting sadness (and often boredom) one must wade through to get there.I don't know. I'm not trying to rain on the Payne parade, but it's just not my spot of tea.The Descendants is a good enough movie. I call it 'good' because it's visually stunning, and intelligent. It's easily watchable, but there's just a lot of better stuff out there. Especially starring Clooney.Might I suggest the aforementioned Up in the Air, instead, perhaps?It touches on a bit more sadness, but it's just as intelligent plus more captivating and fun.Best of all?No quirky teenage girls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's The Descendants was a very good and depressing movie at the same time with George Clooney giving one of the best performances of his career as Matt King a land baron who tries his hardest to reconnect with his daughters (played by Shailene Woodley, and Amara Miller) after his wife who was cheating on him was fatally injured in a boating accident. Director Alexander Payne has done a good job directing this movie because of all the wonderful work that was done. But this movie works as a drama more than a comedy even though there is one funny scene in this film and works as a mystery because of Matt wondering the guy's name of whom his wife left him for. Throughout the course of the film we feel bad for Clooney because of what he has to go through emotionally but in the end it still was a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Descendants is an emotionally powerful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clooney plays Matt King, lawyer and decision maker on whether to sell Hawaiian land his ancestors left to him and his relatives. As well as that, he has two daughters, Scottie (played by Amara Miller) and Alexandra (played by Shailene Woodley) who he has never had time for in the past and after his wife Elizabeth gets into a boating accident and is left in a coma, he has to look after his two girls who he knows very little about.The plot seems to set you up for the typical Comedy-Drama, but then they throw a curve-ball by telling you that there is no hope for Elizabeth and when they unplug the machines she will die in the days following. This surprised me and what follows is one of the most heartwarming yet heartbreaking stories iv seen on film in a while.Matt King as a character simply cant cope with the fact his wife is going to die, stopping and simply gazing into nothingness as he realizes the inevitable is drawing ever closer and he is the one who has to tell close friends and family. A scene towards the end where Matt talks to his wife and says his final goodbye is one of the saddest moments I have ever seen in film and Clooney deserves all the Praise he gets for it.Woodley also surprises as Alexandra. Initially appearing to be the cliché, angry teenager, she soon opens up and we get to see the real her. We get to see her grieve for the mother that she has fought with, the mother that put her in a boarding school, the mother that she still loves dearly and the performance Woodley put forth I still think was worthy of Best Actress, even at that young age.Overall, The Descendants is one of the most emotionally engaging films Iv seen in recent memory and will stay with me as a film that was honest. Never trying to be overly dramatic, just focusing on what the characters were going through was enough for me and i'm sure many other people to burst in to tears by the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I start-I'm just going to point out that I am but a teenager,so my opinion may not have as much value as an elder's might. When I watched the trailer, I saw that majority of the comments were from people criticizing the movie for being boring and having no plot. To say that I began this movie feeling discouraged is an understatement. However, that was disproved within the first ten minutes. The Descendants will make you laugh, cry, be angry, be surprised, etc. George Clooney and Shailene Woodley's acting jobs are exceptionally phenomenal considering the roles they play. They really made you value the family morals and George Clooney's character, Matt King's, decisions. This movie will cause you to have rapid changes of emotion. You'll feel hate but be pitiful, you'll feel annoyance yet understanding, frustration yet happiness, and the list goes on. Basically, go into this movie with an open mind and heart, and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Clooney's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Impression- Being my first Alexander Payne movie that I have seen, I didn't dislike his style like a lot of people do. But there are a whole lot of people who adore how he directs, as of now I'm in that boat. This movie doesn't come off as depressing as some people may think, and its not a true comedy either. I thought it had the perfect tone for the type of story it was showing.Praise- Clooney gives one of his best performances as a drifting father who is just trying to reconnect with his not-so-perfect kids. This movie and Up In the Air proves Clooney still has it, and for me it erases that horrible Batman and Robin movie out of my mind when I think of Clooney. Shailene Woodley also showed her future Oscar talent in her troubled teen role. She is also one of the few actresses who don't have to wear any make up and still look incredible on screen. This movie was also well written, thanks to Payne, Jim Rash and Nat Faxon (The Way Way Back). Even the Sid character annoyed me at first, but he ended up with some great lines. Complaints - There were a few times when the family would just leave town for a few days to go take care of something, or for short business. To me, if a family member is on the brink of dying you don't leave town for anything. In fact, you make sure people come to see you, instead of the opposite. I understand its a movie, but they could have found another way of writing that. I also found there to be few too many coincidences in the plot, and I know Hawaii doesn't have the biggest population but the world just isn't that small.Final thoughts - Even with the plot being somewhat of a downer, this movie still sends you with a good feeling of the importance of family. Cap that off with great performances all around and you have an Oscar contender. I look forward to watching other Alexander Payne movies as well.8.0/10</fullReview>

Before accident happened, they never talked to each other and he and she was cheating on each other. Is marriage even worth it?

		<fullReview>Nice Hawaii ad.As entertaining as Clooney's portrayal of a man struggling with his failure as a husband and father often is in The Descendants, the narrative often seems to founder in a confusion of half-baked dramatic tropes. Shailene Woodley is excellent as Alex, but her character, like Scottie's is introduced with much pathos and promise, but quickly devolves, as though Payne thought he'd done all the work he needed to do in the characters' first scenes. The mandatory, extended tourism shots to indigenous music just underscored this impression of lazy screen writing and I felt pretty frustrated by the end. I'm sure the book is baked a little better, but I don't think I'd enjoy it if the movie is anything to go by. Perhaps Payne, Faxon and Rash should stick to dramedy....now where did I leave my ukulele.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The descendants" is not a movie that can be easily defined. It is a beautifully chiselled gem with a sharp and moving story. The movie begins with the lead role Mr. Matt looking after his 2 daughters and an ailing wife who is hospitalised and in comma after a worst accident. Things go worse after he comes to know about the dark secret about his wife. Then the story picks up with very smooth, slow, emotional twists and turns till the climax as a drama kind of movie. George Clooney gives the performance of his career bagging the whole story on his shoulder as the respectable Mr. Matt King. He has done 100% justice to the role. If you are a great English emotional drama fan this movie is for you. -Reviewed by Sivakumar Balachandran</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Riding on George Clooney's strong emotional performance &amp; Shailene Woodley's equally impressive supporting work, The Descendants is the story of Matt King; an aging father who, after the unfortunate accident of his wife that leaves her in a comatose state, tries to control the increasingly inappropriate behaviors of his two daughters while also dealing with an upcoming sale of his inherited land in Hawaii. After finding out from his daughter Alex that his wife was having an extra-marital affair, Matt goes on to confront the guy she was sleeping with in his own ways &amp; over the course of the story, comes to terms with the whole scenario.It is through director Alexander Payne's brilliant work only that this tragic tale is still able to resonate an incredible humor throughout its runtime &amp; remains entertaining throughout its runtime. Cinematography captures Hawaii in all its beauty, editing keeps the pace steady from start to finish and both Clooney &amp; Woodley give an emotionally charged but incredibly mature &amp; layered performance as the father Matt &amp; elder daughter Alex, respectively. Plus, there is a wonder &amp; calmness to its whole story despite the chaos it represents in a family life.There is nothing really to complain about this film. Almost all the aspects are done right &amp; remain perfectly balanced. The film began on a certain level &amp; stayed on that very level for the entirety of its runtime. There's no high or lows but a constant progression of the story, something many films are unable to do and on an overall scale, The Descendants is a very satisfying film of its year that's brilliantly directed, exquisitely photographed &amp; boasts truly wonderful performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Family Experience...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been to Hawaii before, and the first thing this movie successfully does is showing me the sights and sounds of Hawaii. The scenery is truly beautiful and breathtaking, while the music is brilliantly composed and soothing to the ears. I think George Clooney is exceptionally outstanding in playing the main character, who is troubled with so many things at a time. The emotions that his character experiences throughout the movie really show on his face, and I can only sympathize with his misfortunes. This is a great movie to share with the whole family, as it stresses a lot on family issues and values. The movie shows a really accurate depiction of what a family goes through after losing an important member, and how they deal with it. To see how an estranged father takes ownership, reconciles with his daughters and supports them through their hardship is really a heartwarming experience. The final scene of the movie really says it all and I think it's the perfect ending. I was filled with sheer joy and utter satisfaction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a damn near perfect movie. I'm giving it a 10 to compensate for a couple of unreasonably low ratings I saw in other IMDb reviews. In reality, I'd give it a 9 and express my heartfelt admiration for a job well done by everybody involved. The writing, the acting, the direction, the casting, the photography. It was as close to a perfect film as I can imagine. I'd like to think of some minor quibbles just to dilute all this gushing, but I honestly can't. Maybe the flaws will eventually come to me (it's only been 12 hours since I saw the film). But for now I'm prepared to stick with this unabashed rave. What amazed me most were the little things: the nuanced performances, the underacting, the turns of phrase. It was just a skilled and confident job by all. It was smart and also emotionally savvy. I let myself stay open to the performances. I got hooked by the unexpected twists and turns of plot. I ended up liking characters I was initially repelled by. This is one of those rare films that both adults and kids (teens) can relate to. It never panders. There were literally some moments when I had to stop the film and walk away shaking my head in appreciation.Plainly, this film isn't going to appeal to everybody. Nothing does. But I'd really like to understand how anyone might write a negative review. You plainly won't hear one from me. If you enjoy it half as much as I did, you're going to have a hell of an experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Clooney can't save me from this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a fan of George Clooney. I've said this once before and I'll stick by it, even if he wins every bloody Oscar the academy throw at him. I just find him to be one of those smarmy, too- grinny actors that you just want to punch in the face. At least that's my opinion.There is one redeeming quality about him though and its his recent involvement in the Oscar nominated The Descendants. Directed and written by Alexander Payne (sharing the writing credits with Nat Faxon and Jim Rash), The Descendants follows the life of Matt King, a real estate agent in Hawaii whose fortunate family have allowed him to live a comfortable, stress-free existence for most of his life. That is until his wife, Elizabeth (played by Patricia Hastie), hits her head in a boating accident and falls into a coma. What follows is a humorous journey between a father, his two daughters, and a delinquent teenager, as they attempt to find out about their soon-to-be-late mother's extramarital lover (and inadvertently find out a lot more about themselves in the process).I enjoyed this movie as much as I did not enjoy it. Acting, cinematography and editing were all a little subpar with a bizarre soundtrack which did not add much depth to the overall narrative. However, there was a subtle beauty in this film which I did enjoy, despite my brain's constant chanting of "We Hate Clooney! We Hate Clooney!" (yes, its a bad habit. Apologies). The writing in this film was exquisite. Faxon, Rash and Payne had all made plenty of effort to piece together the various elements of this family's story whilst interweaving an intricate web of the usual "6°of Separation" theory contrasted again the unusual, tropical paradise of Hawaii. Each individual character in this film was cleverly crafted into their own roles. Whilst Clooney took up A LOT of story time, his character was more of an emotionless canvas upon which our other colourful characters painted themselves. Shailene Woodley who plays Alexandra and Amara Miller who plays Scotty work brilliantly against Clooney's obvious discomfort with children so that we clearly see a family who don't know that much about each other really but understand that above all, family does have a special bond, no matter what the circumstances in which they were brought together (I think many of us can agree with this statement). Another aspect to the screenplay which was cleverly conducted was the integration of the very Hawaii-nesqueness in which the story unfolds. Drama happens behind closed doors. Secrets unfold in major tsunamis and soft ripples. And everybody knows everybody, making the whole concept behind this family's difficult social situation that much more reactive.I believe the Academy nominated The Descendants for both best adapted screenplay, director, and picture due to its poignant yet abnormal story that a lot of audience members will enjoy listening to. I do know also that Clooney's acting in this film was MUCH better than his recent adventures (Intolerable Cruelty anyone?) and his character for the first time was not so much George Clooney as it was more Matt King, a fact I could stomach much more easily with my popcorn and Diet Coke. I do think this film will do well at the Oscars but as for the Best Picture nod, I am waiting for a few more viewings before resting that decision on this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's The Descendants is a drama film, with a splash of comedy, that tells the tale of this man who is under stress and pressure from certain aspects of his life and he is finding a way to get through it. This film is very well done and is very deserving of it's accolades, in it's screenplay in particular.The Descendants is written by Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash. This is both Faxon and Rash's first film. This film is very well written with a plot that doesn't lose too much focus on the main issues, which is sometimes found with comedic drama films like this, and the writers have written great dialogue that is believable and not too overly sentimental. The films maintains it's comedic tones through the dialogue from both Clooney, Woodley, and Krause. There are moments where the film feels heartbreaking but there are also times where you end up chuckling at a line for at least a minute as it either came out of nowhere or it just felt so real that it's funny. If a film is able to make me laugh and feel saddened, that is something I am very inclined to revisit in the future.Alexander Payne directed this film and I came into this with no expectations as this is my first experience with the director. There are a few films from Payne's catalogue that I definitely want to see. Payne's handling with this film is definitely excellent. The way he handles this story, which if handled by a different director can be emotional and overly depressing, is very effective. Payne decided to keep the film's tone positive and at times comedic. This decision helps keep the film light and and have the audience come out of it feeling good and satisfied. The film's positive tone is due to the photography, dialogue and the score of the film.The film's photography was handled by Phedon Papamichael, who has worked with Payne before in his previous film, Sideways. Papamichael was also the DP of other films that I have seen as well, The Ides of March and 3:10 To Yuma. Both films has a gritty or dark feel to it's photography, so seeing his work here in The Descendants was shocking. His photography here is beautiful and bright. This intention definitely works with the direction that Payne was going for. There are multiple moments where Hawaii looks amazing. Papamichael definitely show the beauty that Hawaii offers and is definitely ironic when the voice over at the start of the film comes in. He definitely shows that Hawaii is paradise, regardless of what Matt King says. The intimate moments, conversations between characters, are mainly composed of close shots with focus on their emotions and reactions which is critical in showing the connection of each character to the topic that is being discussed, whether it's about Elizabeth or the property in Hawaii.The Descendants is soundtrack driven rather than score driven. This would have been a great opportunity to create a beautiful score to drive the film but the song choices for this film does it's job well. The songs doesn't feel like a soundtrack that stands out but rather it feels appropriate for the setting and adds on to the lightness that Payne is trying to create. The soundtrack isn't the greatest aspect of the film but it does add to what makes this film great.In my first viewing, I used to think it was a Clooney driven performance but in my second viewing, I started to see that it is both a Shailene Woodley and George Clooney driven film. They play off with each other well and it's definitely entertaining to watch. Clooney was already someone I expected a lot from but it was Woodley who definitely surprised and made me a fan of her acting. I'm glad to see a daughter in a film that shows a lot of her personality. Woodley shows the bad side of her, the edgy side of her, and the emotional and vulnerable side of her. The other supporting cast were great, in particular Judy Greer, Beau Bridges and Robert Forster.The Descendants is a film that kept me attracted to it after my first experience with the film due to it's striking photography and fantastic acting between Clooney and Woodley. It may grow on me further during subsequent viewings and the film has the potential to become a much more appreciated film in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conservation Theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While many documentaries have an overt message, this film was subtle yet effective in getting the conservation point across. It shows a very human side to the choices that are made daily to preserve and protect natural resources and our complicated cultural heritage. Ordinary, unlikely people (real-estate lawyer) can be stewards of the environment whether they are forced into that role (as in this film,) or if they choose to oppose developing every piece of land and advocate for saving some of it.The main character, played by Clooney, seems almost heroic in the way he deals with the difficult situation of his wife's accident, his neighbors opposition to the land deal, and facing his family (and his wife's family). We are not really sure what caused this abrupt transformation, but his growing relationship with his daughters seems to contribute to it.As far as happy endings go-it was portrayed in a human way, not the fairy-tale one I would have written (A camping trip on the preserved land with his daughters).I am curious to read the book, and know more about the author (Kaui Hart Hemmings)-is he/ she Hawaiian? It also shows the reality of today's Hawaii-so I get the idea that the author is familiar with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What to make of this one? I consider myself sort of a fan of Alexander Payne, but I can say one thing for sure: I won't end up giving this one the maximum number of points, like I did the rest of his feature films. Still, this isn't bad, not at all.It's hard to say where exactly 'The descendants' goes wrong. Or actually, it doesn't go wrong, but I found the combination of drama and the comedy less compelling than what I had witnessed in Payne's previous, superior, work. Clooney in the lead didn't get as much to me as Laura Dern, Matthew Broderick, Jack Nicholson and Paul Giamatti did before him. And somehow the whole story lacks sharpness that I did see in 'Citizen Kane', 'Election', 'About Schmidt' and 'Sideways'. Still, Payne incorporates a lot of integrity into the story and surprises with the (at times brutal, at times heartwarming) candor that one may expect when looking closer at a family struck by tragedy. And there are plenty of little bits that came off just perfectly, for instance those running scenes or the interaction with the (pretty much brilliant) Sid character.Anyway, 'The descendants' is a film I would still recommend any day of the week. A good 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matt King (George Clooney) is descendant from Hawaiian royalty. And he must decide on what to do with his inheritance of a large tract of land. His daughters have no respect for him. And his wife Elizabeth is on life support after a boating accident.There is something about his wife that he doesn't know at first. It is an emotional punch to the gut. This does lead to a very powerful scene at the end. Clooney stretches out his acting skills that he doesn't usually use. He is at times a pathetic loser.Director/writer Alexander Payne is pulling something out of this that George is not known for. For a long time now, he's been this suave sexiest man alive. He isn't that guy here.It's both good and bad. It's nice to see him stretch. But it's disconcerting to see him against type. Shailene Woodley does a good turn as an opinionated teen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love films that discuss things that happen to normal people, The Decedents feels real. It's filled with life and all the flaws that come along with it. Life is a tumbling spiral of events that starts with one problem and when that begins to clear up another complication reveals itself. The screenplay is the film's big thank you for all the realistic conversations, situations, and feelings. George Clooney does his normal "George Clooney" pose, except with a little more dramatic emotion being released. Shailene Woodley was my favorite performance in the film, spirited in her role. Woodley was the film's biggest surprise for me. Though The Decedents has a lot of real-life sorrow to offer, there is nice comedy mixed throughout.Rating: 7.5/10Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Family copes with dying mother. Oh no - chick flick! But this is very good.The plot involves the sale of a family trust of land, but that only adds false sentiment. The core is how a father deals with his wife's relations - father, mother, daughters, daughter's boyfriend, and the slimy cuckolder - when his wife's star is fading in a hospital bed.Great acting. Clooney and Greer are always good, but the best is Woodley as the daughter. A few characters could have been done better: the boyfriend almost overcame annoyingness, and the younger daughter and the alzheimers mother should have been given more funnies - script fail.The music is pleasant, nice atmosphere. And I think anyone who has been at the bedside of a dying person will give a sigh over the hospital scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie but others don't get it, why? I'll tell you why....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a few reasons why some of us disliked this movie. First, the director and actor nailed it. I could actually feel my chest tighten and the air getting sucked out of my lungs in the bar scene. There are some of us who have never been in these situations. This is not a spoiler alert, I'm just showing a list of situations. Death Births Weddings Love Infidelity Blood familyI'll give you a great example of why we may never feel the true love or hate compared to one who's actually feeling it. You're own child. If you are not a parent, you will NEVER know the true feeling of loving or losing a child. Until, you become a parent, then we may compare apples to apples. Otherwise, stop the hate because you have no clue to what you're reviewing. Parents, think back when you watched an emotional scene in a movie and understood it. But, this is before your child was born. And then after watching the same film when you became a parent, the emotions were ten fold. No comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Done, but Depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies are a great way to escape your normal life, and travel to different places, situations, times, etc. This one takes you to Hawaii. The state is pretty much a character in the film. You get to witness the day-to-day life of one particular family. Unfortunately, that family is going through a terrible tragedy, and just trying to get through it, one day at a time. The scenery and acting are awesome, and the film really inspires deep thought about family bonds, but don't watch this unless you're ready for some depressing subject matter and an appropriately-slow pace.For more reviews and a kick-ass podcast, check out www.livemancave.com!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Descendants Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants- **** (out of 4): Every once in a while there comes a film that is not overly brutal or overly sentimental or overly apathetic towards its characters and subject matter. A film that falls into a category of near perfection in tone and execution. That is the best way I can describe Alexander Payne's "The Descendants", perhaps one of the greatest films of the new decade. It is so perfectly paced and scripted, the moments of emotional intensity and humor are so hypnotically drawn together, the performances are of such fine composure. It is a movie that draws you in, it numbs you from the start and takes you on an emotional journey, bringing you into the heart and soul of this struggling family in paradise. All I can add to what I have said previously is that you need to go see it. It's not a film to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life Is All About Drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants, which many people claim to be one of the best movies of 2011, is worth the hype. The movie puts emphasis on what is life all about. We are meant to interpret the meanings of life and death and how one should deal with both. This is also quite a funny film, but there are some sad, dramatic moments too. I also find that some people may relate to this movie because the story seems like it could happen in real life.Alexander Payne's film is about a family whose mother is slowing dying after a terrible accident. The husband of the mother, Matt King is also in the midst of a business deal where he would sell off his family land. This film covers the outcomes of each event and also has themes of family and reconciliation.George Clooney is a wonderful actor and delivers another strong performance. However, the actress to look out for in the future is Shailene Woodley. In her first really big role, she shines as Matt King's daughter, Alexandra. She is believable in the role and she nicely compliments Clooney.Overall, this is a great film that will come off as dramatic, but is actually pretty funny. This movie works because it has family themes and it wants to show what it takes to make a family perfect. If you're going to watch this, you may need a few tissues. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch for Two Descents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One way to watch this movie is to think about various uses of the word "descend". The title refers to family lineage of course, but we can descend into chaos, into deeper emotions or into relationships with depth. We may "fall" in love, fall into routines, we "settle down" and so on. And of course, we can descend in water.There are three key scenes of descent into water. The film opens with who we learn later is the ill-fated wife and mother as she falls from grace. She sits passively in a speeding boat, letting her illicit lover steer, oblivious to the destruction just ahead.The next water scene is still early in the movie, when her husband, Matt King (did he have to have this name?), played by George Clooney approaches his angry, teenage daughter Alexandra (Shaylene Woodley), as she swims. He breaks the news that her mom, now on life support following a boat crash, will not survive. As she absorbs the news she sinks into the water in silent agony. She is over her head, we might say, in turbulent emotions. Still working hard to hide her vulnerability as she strides away, her endearing teenage response is, "I can't believe you told me in the POOL!"Within a few days, we see this girl grow into a woman. We follow primarily the Clooney character however, as he exhibits both clumsiness and grace while he cleans up his wife's mess and as he reshapes ties to his family, both nuclear and extended.Clooney plays his role with low-key affect. This is intriguing at a moment in the film when Alexandra's seemingly goofy male friend reveals that he himself has lost a parent tragically. Clooney looks at him blankly, a bit short on compassion. Perhaps in that moment though, he is seeing revealed the resourcefulness of his daughter and the depth of her caring.The final scene is a world of coziness. By this time, Matt has directed the protection of a large parcel of land, as idyllic as Eden, and we could think of the family as biblical descendants. The ones, perhaps, who shall inherit the earth.Just prior to this, the camera descends into water again. Like a bookend, the image contrasts with what we saw in the swimming pool. This time as we see not anguish but serenity, as we descend from the waves above to the still waters below.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Descendants is a sad movie, but not a desponding one.The good. The scenario is very realistic. All the actions and reactions of the characters as well as their emotional state and the resulting dialogs are a good reflection of reality. All the personas have great depth and consistency. There are very nice twists and turns in the story that will surprise you.The actors. A well chosen cast. George Clooney give us a very good interpretation of a guy who really wants to pick things up. Shailene Woodley is just right as the strong minded daughter of a strong minded woman. Amara Miller gives us a bit of youthful antics to alleviate things. Nick Krause is the unwilling toned down comic relief as the Hawaiian bum. Robert Forster is the perfect sour grand-father. And finally, Matthew Lillard and Judy Greer are surprisingly good in their small supporting role.The bad. The Hawaiian music, I can't stand it. It's appropriate though, but it's not for me. Maybe it's for you.The ugly. Nothing really. It's a well made movie.The result. A slow pace movie with a nice realistic feel to it, plenty of emotions, and family issues. No great dramatic upheaval, no action, just straight story telling with a few surprises.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A man and his island</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt King hasn't been on a surfboard in over fifteen years, despite living in Hawaii his whole life with illustrious acres of land under his family name and two estranged daughters he's unable to cope. Appearances are deceptive. Even in name, Matt King is hardly a monarch. Burdened by endless hours of work, King's life is thrust into difficult circumstances when his wife suffers a fatal boating accident. King must think his daughters would be better off if he was dead himself.The Descendants is a starkly realistic tragic scenario told in a sardonic way. The scriptwriting is brilliant. We are compelled by Matt King's relationship to his impetuous daughters and his bleak outlook on life accentuates everything. We're permitted to laugh facetiously on the side at King's misfortunes. Portraying King in a career-defining role is George Clooney, whose stoic facial features and casual drone actually enhance the characterization. Matt King narrates that descendant upon descendant in his family's lineage has owned a privatized, uninhabited area of land on one of Hawaii's islands. It's worth millions. But he employs this fact with nonchalance, as if he wants nothing to do with inheriting it. The situation worsens when King is at the top of a tug of war between family members. Everybody wants to sell it for a future hotel and strike rich. King would love the money but knows that millions in the state oppose deconstructing a preserved niche of land. Matt King is probably burdened with making the greatest decision in the history of the Kings.In the meantime, King's wife is hospitalized. She's moribund. His relationship to her was rather cold despite what appeared to be a healthy marriage on the outside, and when the doctor informs King of the worst, he has to handle how to tell cousins, parents and, most of all, his two daughters. Newcomer Shailene Woody plays King's eldest, rebellious daughter Alexandra. The interaction between these two is priceless. Alexandra dismisses her father's authority. She'll cuss him out. King can't figure out why she's so irate. There's also Scotty, King's ten-year old daughter, who has the vivacious spirit of a much older girl. King is unable to connect with either of them. My only gripe about these scenes is the impending presence of Alexandra's oafish boyfriend, Sid. The comic relief worked?to a point. Having Sid lollygagging on every adventurous tirade or pontificating between every emotional scene was about as annoying to me as it was to Clooney. Perhaps annoyance was the purpose but it didn't detract my desire to want to blacken Sid's other eye.The Descendants felt nonfictional as it further progressed. The situations only became worse and the irony was magnified. I chuckled wryly at it, but not at the obvious parts. The film successfully transcends how obnoxiously difficult and unorthodox life is. We have imperfect relationships, harrowing jobs and tiresome quandaries with those around us. The Descendants is an eminent reminder of the absence of simplicity in our life. Matt King often saunters past the black and white portraits of his ancestors. Would they approve with his decisions? Would they empathize? Two centuries later I'm sure King's descendant will be wondering the same thing as he glances at the photograph of Matt King's stoic face; unsmiling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Descendants" looks at rectification amid tragedy. George Clooney's Hawaii land baron has no choice but to reconsider his relationship with his daughters after his wife suffers a boating accident that leaves her comatose. To me, it seems like the plot is a metaphor for any society: it might seem fun and idyllic, but there's always something unpleasant beneath the surface. In Hawaii's case, it looks like a paradise, but the indigenous Hawaiians are now a minority in their own land. (this is just conjecture, so don't quote me) But anyway, it's a really good movie. In addition to fine acting and direction, the ukulele music moves the action along perfectly. It's one that you should see. I haven't experienced anything like what the movie depicts so I can't comment on its authenticity, but at face value it's really good. I've liked every one of Alexander Payne's movies so far, and this continues the streak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>touching drama about family tragedy and reconciliation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll say it first, George Clooney is always great and in this he is rather outstanding playing a rather tense and tragic role but with his trademark dark humour and genius. The cast were all good, especially the three child actors.Set in beautiful Hawaii it opens by saying how just because it's a paradise it doesn't mean everyone is happy, successful and stress free and the story follows the King family - Clooney - who is in the hospital with his wife in a coma following an accident. He's a successful old-money Lawyer who has become distanced from his two girls and in this family tragedy he has to rekindle the relationships with them despite all the wrinkles that he has to deal with. It's realistic, believable and emotional but without being depressing; it's quite uplifting really. It's not unpredictable, but surprises aren't what you want with this film. It's naturalistically filmed, no tricks, bells or whistles and Clooney certainly carries the film despite there being a lot of familiar faces. It's down as "comedy" but I wouldn't call it that really without using terms like "dark" or "black" in there too. I would term it a light drama really, the subject matter is very sad and if it is close to home it will be even more difficult to watch.Overall, this is a great film, worth the watch and worth all the hoo-har it caused in Tinseltown and all the gongs. Well deserved. Enjoyed it. Uplifting in a low-key kind of way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potentially Both Heart-Wrenching And Heart-Warming But Its Focus Wasn't Always Clear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Descendants" has a few things going for it, no doubt. First is the basic story. It's a heart-wrenching tragedy that the King family is going through. Mom Elizabeth has been involved in a boating accident, and now she's in a coma and on life support. She's not really expected to make it. Her husband Matt (George Clooney) is having to deal with her pending death and at the same time try to deal with his less than ideal relationship with his daughters Alex (Shailene Woodley) and Scottie (Amara Miller.) Matt's efforts to rebuild those relationships could also have made this potentially heart-warming and not just heart- wrenching. That in itself was a lot. It was emotional, and quite appropriately it had a few moments of humour that were necessary to lift the overall rather down mood. Clooney isn't my favourite actor. He was competent in this. I wouldn't go any farther than that. He just never seems to grab me with his performances. I was more impressed with Woddley to be honest. I thought she did a really good job as Alex, the older of the two sisters who's had a troubled relationship with both parents and who gets essentially forced back into the family's life after being away at boarding school as the tragedy unfolds. She was impressive. The movie also has Hawaii going for it. Is there a better place to set a movie? What I appreciated about this was that the movie didn't go overboard in its use of the setting, but scattered throughout were some very nice shots of the Hawaiian landscape. I have to say, though, that the scenery aside (and while I liked and was touched by the basic plot) the story as a whole really didn't grab me.Setting the pace of the movie aside (which I thought was rather slow) I thought that there was too much introduced. In addition to the drama around Elizabeth I really didn't need the subplot about the family's land, and whether or not it was going to be sold and to whom it was going to be sold. I mean, I understand the cultural context. I understand that land ownership and heritage protection is a huge issue in Hawaii. I just didn't think it added much to the movie. It seemed like something that was forced onto the story rather than something that fit well. There were also characters that I just didn't care for. To mention one: Alex's friend Sid (Nick Krause.) I'm sorry, but aside from a little bit of comic relief at his whole "surfer dude" (or was it "pothead") persona I didn't think he added much to the movie, and he wouldn't have been missed even a bit if his character hadn't been included.Generally speaking, I thought the movie had too much of a melodramatic feel to it. I'm not sure we need all the extraneous family tensions involved. The story of the dying wife and Matt's attempt to come to terms with both her condition and single parenthood would have been enough. Having so much added on seemed to make this lose its focus. Overall, this really didn't impress me all that much. (4/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully redeeming, clever and a bit funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the fourth Alexander Payne movie I've seen and in some ways it is the best. It is the most affecting, that's for sure, at least for me. I cried through a good part of it. What I found so touching was the way the characters came to grips with the reality of their lives and in the way the King family?Matt (George Clooney), Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) and Scottie (Amara Miller)?strengthened their family ties despite the tragedy and the various unpleasant revelations.As Elizabeth King lies dying in a deep coma after a water skiing accident, it is her workaholic husband Matt who has to take care of a slightly dysfunctional family. He is the trustee of a great Hawaiian estate on the island of Kauai that now must be sold. Getting closer to his children he first learns that younger daughter Scottie's behavior needs a lot of work. Then he goes to the Big Island where his older daughter Alexandra is at school and finds her drunk. And then he learns... Well, it's better if you see the movie and see what she tells him that so sets him off.While this is almost as funny as the other Payne movies I've seen (Election 1999, About Schmidt 2002, and Sideways 2004) it is not as satirical. Payne reaches for our hearts in this one instead of our whimsy.Clooney is excellent in a part that emphasizes his controlled and very winning leading man style. He does a lot with restraint and subtle expressiveness. Woodley (just 19 as the film was shot) played the wiser-than-her-years teen with just enough edginess and spitfire to be believable. She is so pretty that just looking at her brought me to tears. But perhaps the most natural performance was that by Amara Miller as the foul-mouthed, chubby little girl who wants to be as grownup as her big sister.Interesting to me personally were the settings on location in Hawaii since I watched the film not long after spending nearly three weeks on Oahu, Maui, Hawaii, and Kauai. I recall driving into Princeville (as Matt and family do) on Kauai and being in the exact spot at the airport as they were. And the shot of the ocean with Honolulu in the background that opened the movie brought back memories.The real strength of the movie for me though was in the script and the direction. The clever dovetailing of the plot and subplot (the search for the truth about Matt's marriage; and the disposition of the fabulous estate on Kauai) melded seamlessly together as Matt meets real estate agent (and not a nice guy), Brian Speer. Underlying the story is something deeper though, and that is the growth as human beings that we see the characters go through, especially that of Matt and Alexandra.Excellent in a minor role was Judy Greer as Brian Speer's wife.?Dennis Littrell, author of "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good If Not Extraordinary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pros: Let's be honest for a moment. You come to this movie for George Clooney, and if we're going to keep being honest, he's certainly worth the price of admission, suiting his best actor nomination nicely. But what may be surprising to some of you is the fact that his co-star, Shailene Woodley, does her part to keep pace with the much higher pedigreed Clooney. While other characters provide welcome comic relief and dramatic foils, Clooney's Matt and Woodley's Alex give the film a very human element with whom the viewer can't help but identify. Who would have thought we would be saying that about the first Batman with nipples (part of me feels bad for planting that thought in your head... but only part) and a chick most known for starring in modern teen soap operas?Aiding in the effort to get the viewers emotionally invested is a very deep immersion in the Hawaiian setting with the film's characters. From the stunning visuals to the quaint musical soundtrack to the constant bare feet, the movie brings the feel of Hawaii into the theater (well, I'm assuming this, since I've admittedly never actually been to Hawaii). In the end, you're left feeling as though you have actually experienced the events of the movie side by side with Matt and Alex.Cons: I know I just talked about how easy it is to identify with the main characters, but it's actually a little difficult to identify with a lawyer trust fund baby who lives in a tropical paradise and struggles with anything. *Coughfirstworldproblemscough*. Okay, so it's not quite so superficial as that, but you do still have to kick yourself every time you're reminded of the fact that, really, these people have it alright. Well, I didn't actually need to do any kicking of myself, because I was so busy enjoying the movie, but hopefully I just planted that thought into your head.Overall: Despite the plot revolving around a topic that traditionally makes me pretty uncomfortable, it's all actually a funny and enjoyable movie. The script made me breeze through the whole viewing, eagerly waiting to see what would happen to "us" next. On the other hand, while it is a fun to watch little movie, it isn't really all that special. Nothing about it stands out to me, and I'm pretty sure in five years I'll mostly just remember it for being nominated for best picture. But after gazing into Clooney's dark and stormy eyes, I can't help but give the movie an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The two main themes that the film is based on are : -dealing with the lost of a loved one, and -holding on to the tradition. Payne does a great job by combining those two together. The characters are real and ordinary people, with their problems, passions, mistakes. They seem not to communicate, lost in their own believes. However the fatal accident will reunite them again, bring them closer, in order to understand each other better. On the other hand, the second theme is getting lost in the first one, mentioned only at the beginning and at the end. And even then, it is not expanded properly. Great performances from the actors, keep the audience interested till the end, which, in my opinion, was lucking of that volume that the rest of the film had. All in all, it is a great film about human and family relationships.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty decent for watching once, but with forced emotions and mostly pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw that Blu-Ray at the shop and read "George Clooney" my first thought was - that's going to be a great movie. Well, after watching it I can say it was a fairly decent one after all. Some very beautiful landscape visuals, too.But there are many missed opportunities for some touching scenes. Like when Alexandra grabs that cell phone, just like her willful mother, when there's a call from the real estate agency, before her father is able to stop her, and does his job talking instead of him. No emotion on his face. Or like when she tells him about discovering that her mother was cheating on him, sitting on the couch, then breaking into tears. He does nothing just standing around, when he could just sit down beside and comfort her like any loving father would be expected to. Or like when Alexandra's friend Sid is speaking bad of his wife while they're driving. Matt abruptly stops his car and all he's able to bring out at Cid is pointing a threatening finger and just sitting there afterwards as if lost in place, instead of throwing him out of the car which would be the sensible thing to do. Or or or, this could go on.Speaking of which, I didn't really get it why that half-witted Sid had to be tagging along through the entire movie with his insolent grin and nothing meaningful to say. No sane father would be able to tolerate someone like him around for long, even being as clueless as Clooney playing one. Sid pretty much seemed to be out of place everywhere they went, making me wish Matt would throw him out already. Instead he is chatting with him and actually asking, of all people, the light-headed boy for advice on how to handle his own daughters. I guess there's nothing more to say after that.It's clearly visible George is trying hard to get those emotions pushed out, in some of the scenes almost looking as if pushing (forgive me the comparison) with all his strength to give birth to a baby which isn't there in the first place. As that, there's lack of natural emotions on screen, (one notable exception being Shailene Woodley who I think was great playing his older daughter Alexandra) which is why the movie mostly left me with a feeling of dissatisfaction. Overall, it's a pleasant, well-done, but mostly forgettable movie, not one I'm going to be watching another time again. What it lacks is that special highs and lows which would make something really excellent out of it. There's mostly just dull melancholy dragging on throughout the movie. The same monotone guitar music playing all the time didn't help much either. It did resolve everything just before the end credits though, when a heart-warming sequence showed an image of the father and his two daughters being one family whole again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>spoilers alert %%% - This movie is really worthless. A 2 hour long funeral, a wife and mother dying, cheating fights with a dying woman attached on a machine, some postcard hawaiian culture, a non-sense story with the daughter and his friend joining the father going around to announce the death of the dying woman, all very predictable and boring, the only thing worth watching is Shailene Woodley, really beautiful (if you didn't know her already, i didn't). Very sentimental and cheesy, immature people becoming a little more mature and at the end the disturbed family sits down watching TV together, after the dying woman is finally dead. This is the meaning (?!). And the husband suddenly doesn't sell the ancestors land because he's hawaiian and he suddenly feels some hawaiian duty toward his blood... Something like that. It may be original because of how bad, unoriginal, non-sense and yet predictable it is. A 1 star, 2 extra stars for the girl and a couple of funny jokes, not enough for a 2 hours long funeral. Soap opera trashy good feelings and banal characters.</fullReview>

I want to like Clooney, but this was not a meaningful performance, or anything Oscar-worthy, plus there was like a weird pedo vibe between him and his daughter in the movie, it was just painful to watch. If G.C. had like a Murray type of believable middle-aged man approach, I could like this movie.I did not hate it, but could never like it.Also the pace is all wrong, it's was as though payne wasn't sure if this was a comedy or drama and hoped the actors would solve it.Don't waste your time, there is talent out there!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like George Clooney. He's a likable guy. And I enjoy his being on screen. But I'll have to make these comments short because I was unable to sit through "The Descendants." I take it from some of the reviews that there were moments of comedy in the film but they must not have taken place during the first thirty-five minutes that I watched. Clooney's wife suffers a mortal injury in a boat race and he's told that she's dying. Two tragedies -- boat accident and the revelation that the injury is fatal -- in the first ten minutes.Clooney gets his two daughters together at home. One is about seven and sensitive, the other is a nubile teen who is a marginal alcoholic. Neither gets along with him particularly well. The older daughter tearfully informs Clooney that he's so stupid he didn't know his wife was having an affair. And he really DIDN'T.I don't know how most men would handle such a revelation but, given that his wife is now a vegetable and rapidly losing turgor, I would get drunk and shrug it off as a not especially important datum. But Clooney goes berserk at the news and runs in his zoris down the street to the house of some friends, demanding from them the identity of the cuckold, panting all the time.That's about when I quit. I have enough pain in my own life. The spray from the shower head is beginning to feel as if it's saturated with nematocytes. Basta, I say. If Clooney wants to spend an hour and a half rolling around in anger, frustration, and despair, that's his business.His mellifluous narration and the picturesque locations with their rain-laden clouds, and not even his own up-to-par performance and a pretty good one from the nubile teen, can lift this movie out of its melancholia. I can't think of any reason to watch it unless you want to see somebody who's even worse off than you are. And even that piddling pleasure is circumscribed by the fact that he's a rich lawyer living in paradise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Descendants Ascends ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether rich or poor, illness does descend upon us and while this is not a picture about arguing about letting go when someone is hopelessly ill with no chance of recovery, it is about the relations of the husband and his daughters, wealthy people, that ensue when their mother is critically injured in a boating accident.Imagine the shock of the father, George Clooney in a remarkably compelling, but restrained performance, learns that his wife was having an affair with a man who would ultimately benefit from the large parcel of land that is being sold in Hawaii.This excellent film details the human relations involved with a totally wealthy, but dysfunctional family. It also shows how they shall coalesce ultimately when the chips are down.Robert Forster, as the dying woman's father, has some acting stealing scenes as the hard driven materialistic person who only can think what a neglectful Clooney should have done and about the proposed sale of the land.A terrific film with fine performances by all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Descendants suffers from a script a bit too linear that lacks substance and depth; the movie is also a bit lengthy at times and that doesn't help either. On the other hand, Payne's cinematography is perfect and the actors performances, especially Clooney's, are outstanding: they convey a lot of emotions and really make you care about the characters. Those two points contribute largely to improving the global impression.The Descendants is a pretty solid movie overall, but it lacks that little thing that could have made it unforgivable though. Worth a second watch to maybe sharpen your thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensitive and moving US film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(A 35-year-old British man writes): I enjoyed it. It's sensitive and moving, and not too over-sentimental or traumatically heart- wrenching. Also, I found the plot easy to follow. It was nice to have an idyllic, sun-shining background to explore the bereavement, infidelity and parenting issues, and the proportion of lighter moments was about right. The beaches and land further back from the coast looked very enticing. I would tend to hope (in the context of the film's plot, not necessarily real life) that the authorities could make that land a state or national park. Another friend advised me that George Clooney is "almost believable", because his George Clooney-ness makes him so difficult to see as someone other than himself. This is a good description of him in all of the films in which I can remember him featuring, and is meant as a compliment to his acting ability. If I have one small criticism, it would be that there were moments when the humour (if that's what it was intended to be) seemed out of place or inappropriate, like when Clooney's character was running down the road in flip-flops after being told about his wife's affair. I laughed out loud though when the grandfather hit the elder daughter's idiotic boyfriend?classic comic timing. If anyone rents or buys the DVD (I don't know if this applies to versions outside Britain or Europe), the only special feature worth watching is the third, "Casting". The other two can be summed up as, respectively, "Isn't George Clooney just wonderful (sighhhhh)?", and "Isn't the director just wonderful?" Both sent me into an irritated torpor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's like reading a great short story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a complicated story, and there is no typical Hollywood over-dramatization to get you any adrenaline rush, but as plain as the story is, I love this movie for this very reason. Weirdly, watching this movie is like reading a short story, and you get the similar satisfaction of reading a great short story. The voice-over of Matt King (Clooney) in the opening scene sets the mood, and most importantly, it sets a philosophical tone: no matter how unique you are (real or being perceived), your sufferings are same as everyone else's. I have absolutely nothing in common with Matt King?where I live, how I make a living, how my marriage is going, etc., (with only one exception, that we are both male), but by the closing of the story, I identified myself with Matt so much that I was absolutely convinced what Matt had been through would have happened to me. Or philosophically, it had already happened. The director Alexander Payne was able to pull this off because he doesn't let actors (even with the statue like Clooney), dialogues (keep them concise and barely minimum), and setting (make it simple but not boring) get into the story. He's a master of realism, so the movie is almost like a documentary. Clooney is wonderful for not over-doing Matt King, and Shailene Woodley is terrific matching up with Clooney as his elder daughter Alexandra. I'm not quite sure about the role of Sid, Alexandra's friend. This is the only role in the movie that I think the screenwriter could have done a better job. Although I didn't get any adrenaline rush while seeing the movie, I was lingering about it afterward, much longer than a lot other movies I saw. Even if I forgot the plot of the story down the road, the emotion it provoked with survive for a long time to come. Just like reading a great story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often painful, at times funny -- a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently, George Clooney seems to participate in films where he is the only real star - as in The American, Up In The Air, for example. And professionally high-level he undoubtedly is. I have always admired his ability to perform naturally and critically even in non-A category movies. But as for The Descendants, the latter is not the case: its director Alexander Paine deserved his Academy Award (although for the script and shared), but Paine has always been a sign of quality.The background is sad and tragic, and although all events are related to or originating from this woman in coma, the scenes are vivid and logical, all characters are contextual (and children use strong language as they often do in real life), and the only cliché for me was the main character's (Matt King) decision concerning the big sales. It is not, however, a family film in the Disney sense, no pure entertainment, but a film enabling reflections and reckoning - and perhaps some thinking over.And last but not least - Hawaiian landscape, a really nice "supporting actor", together with local music and customs.</fullReview>

Like Rory McIlroy when going in 4th round with the lead, it seems Payne is ending it by doing it effortless. And with a smile. Every actor is at his best in here. Robert Forster and Judy Greer, for the better. Even George Clooney, who's playing such a low profile character, is doing real fine. He's not the most gifted actor, but he's touching our heart quite well in this film. This a tragic story, but shot in a magnificent place. It is like listening to a great pop song with sad lyrics. Payne is again showing us a man who's life is collapsing without any doubt, but standing still. Like in "About Schmidt", "Sideways", "Election" and "Citizen Ruth" (a woman in this one). It's funny, but you don't laugh. It's sad, but you don't cry. Sometimes, life is just too hard to bear. You can't not like this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despair in Paradise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is little that tempts the viewer to book a Hawaiian holiday after watching "The Descendants". In Alexander Payne's first film since 2004's Oscar winning "Sideways", sun-kissed beaches, blue skies and carefree watersports make way for leaden clouds and choppy ocean swells. It rains often, forcing characters to awkwardly run for cover in their flip-flops. At home, George Clooney, his hair greying with worry, sits up at nights, working on legal papers. There's not a slice of guava to be seen and pineapples are extinct. In short, this is all a far cry from the reverie of Elvis Presley's "Paradise Hawaiian Style".Clooney plays Matt King, father to a ten-year-old tearaway Scottie (Amara Miller) and her equally rebellious sister Alexandra (Shailene Woodley). The Kings, and by that I mean the extended family of cousins and aunts living across a number of islands, are preparing to sell a large parcel of land which has been in the family for generations. Resort developers promise the clan untold millions. Matt, however, has other preoccupations. His wife, recently injured in a boating accident, lies in a coma. She will never recover, doctors tell him. Matt has to break the news to his wayward breed and, in the process, assume the role of parent.None of this is new territory for Clooney who, at various times in his career, has taken delight in portraying misguided zealots ("The Men Who Stare at Goats"), soulless suits ("Up In The Air") and dandyish egotists ("O' Brother, Where Art Thou?"). In truth, he is more restrained here. We can't imagine the Clooney of "Ocean's Eleven" as anything other than a fussy, if suave, lothario. In contrast, when his daughter asks him what he'd like to eat in a restaurant, he waves her away with "Order me anything". His clothing, for the most part, consists of half-sleeved shirts, shorts and flip-flops. Yet as storms close around his family, Matt takes stock of the situation and steers the King clan away from looming danger. Clooney's is a subtle performance, free of histrionics."The Descendants" also bookends a series of four films about men in crisis, which started with Matthew Broderick fraying at the seams in "Election". In that film, Broderick's middle aged angst, expressed through his all-or-nothing hatred of a high school over-achiever, was a comic exaggeration which sealed the character's fall from grace. In "Sideways", Paul Giamatti showed us that men stop living when they too eagerly embrace their obsessions. In "The Descendants", Clooney isn't looking to upend his life: he wants to make up for his previous absenteeism. When he learns of his dying wife's affair and travels with his eldest daughter to confront the object of her unfaithfulness ? a property dealer called Brian Speer ? Matt doesn't resort to threats, abuse or violence. The scene is quietly played out in Speer's holiday home, at an island in the kitchen. He even agrees not to inform the salesman's wife of his transgressions.In the end, death marks the end of the whole affair. After his wife passes away, the family scatters her ashes at sea. And in the most peaceful moment of an otherwise blustery film, Matt later settles down to eat ice cream and watch television with his children. The scene, which runs for nearly 90 seconds, is near silent and has the Kings watching a TV set in front of them. For the first time in a while, it seems, the bad weather has vanished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what it seems?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this a couple nights ago with a friend. Did not know much about it other than the advertisements from when it first came out and had heard it was a good movie. But that's where things went wrong for me. Maybe it's me but the advertising made me think this was a sort of broad quirky comedy about a frustrated dad and it looked very funny. It's not a bad film--it has a few comedic moments (very few) but really is a drama and a long slow moving one at that. In addition, it borders on downright depressing. There are so many "buttons" here that get pressed--infidelity, mortality, estranged families, loss of long held valued possessions, environmental issues. What saved it for me mostly was I thought George Clooney did an impressive performance as a man struggling to come to terms with an event in his life and the strained relationship he has with his older daughter. I agree with another reviewer here that the movie gives you the sense of building up to some larger revelation that never comes. It's just different overall than what one might expect as I said. But I also very much enjoyed the scenery as I love Hawaii and this was filmed on both Oahu and Kauai and I recognized many places in the film. Some really gorgeous shots. Beware though, there is a lot of swearing and cynicism in this film and is not for kids, nor if you're looking for an evening of comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I must say this movie had a lot of good actors and actresses in it. George Clooney finally acted like a normal man and he did very well. So was Matthew Lillard, who we know from Scooby Doo and finally learned this way to act more mature. It made the movie very realistic. The story was original, the comedy and drama found a good mix and that made the movie less heavy than it could have been.What really bothered me was the beginning, where Cloony's character was wining about living in Hawaii and having a wife in the hospital. That living on Hawaii is not that fantastic compared to what people think who never have been in Hawaii. That's the biggest crap I have ever heard. Most people endure a loss of a family member or a member who is in a hospital for a long time. But they don't live in Hawaii. I have seen my own father down the hill many times and still I don't get used to it. I can't go to the beach when I have been at the hospital to visit him. Most of the time it's raining here, so the beginning was a bit wrong in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Descendants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw bit and pieces of trailers and reviews for this film; I was certainly interested to see what it would actually be about, especially because of the great reviews by critics and the award accolades, from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Alexander Payne (Election, About Schmidt, Sideways). Basically in Honolulu lives lawyer Matt King (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated George Clooney) who controls his family's trust that own 25,000 pristine acres of land in Kauai, but this trust will be lost in seven years, so the King family plan to sell the land to be developed by native Don Holitzer. But before this deal can go through Matt suffers the devastation of his wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) having a serious boating accident and has gone into a coma, and this is also hard for his two daughters, ten year old Scottie (Amara Miller) and seventeen year old Alexandra 'Alex' (Golden Globe nominated Shailene Woodley). While Elizabeth is in comatose in Queen's Hospital, Matt has to listen to complaints about Scottie's inappropriate behaviour in school and destructive behaviour from Alex, but he is most devastated to be told by the doctor that his wife will never wake from the coma, and by her wishes she will be taken off life support soon. He knows that Scottie will be really upset, so he only tells Alex this sad news, and she finally reveals a truth that she has been hiding before the accident, that Elizabeth was having an affair, and only family friends the Mitchells, Kai (Mary Birdsong) and Mark (Rob Huebel) may know the man who she was with. They do confirm that the mystery man is named Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard), and the Kings find out that he is a real estate agent, so Matt has decided to find him on vacation in Kauai, not just to confront him, but to tell him that Elizabeth will die, to give him the chance to say his goodbyes. After Matt tells all the other friends and family that care about Elizabeth, he, his daughters and Alex's slacker friend Sid (Nick Krause) travel to find Brian Speer, and while jogging on the beach he is surprised to coincidentally pass and recognise the man, and he sees that he is renting a beach cottage that happens to be owned by Matt's cousin Hugh (Beau Bridges). Hugh tells him that Brian is Don Holitzer's brother in law, and he stands to gain a lot of commission from the King family's land if it is sold and developed, and Matt also gets the opportunity to meet Brian's wife Julie (Judy Greer) pretending just to be a passer-by who happens to know people her husband does. Eventually Matt decides to go to the cottage and meet Brian face to face, bringing Alex with him, and after getting his daughter to distract Julie, he introduces himself as Elizabeth's wife, and they talk with nothing held back about the affair, and he confesses that while she loved him, he did not feel any true passion for her, as he cares for his wife and family more, and he apologises for the hurt. After they have left and returned home Matt meets with many of his cousins who have voted in majority for Don Holitzer to take the family's 25,000 acres, but as the sole trustee he refuses to sign the form and to find a different solution, and he ignores that the cousins may take legal action for this decision. It comes to the last day that Elizabeth will be on life support, Scottie is finally told by a consultant what is happening, and Elizabeth's parents the Thorsons, Scott (Robert Forster) and Alice 'Tutu' (Barbara L. Southern) are there, and there is a surprise when it is not Brian that shows up, but his wife Julie, who is now aware of the affair he had with Elizabeth. Julie forgives Elizabeth, despite wanting to hate her for the deceit, Matt tenderly kisses his wife for the final goodbye, and Alex and Scottie say their goodbyes too, and Elizabeth is finally taken off life support, and later the three of them scatter the ashes in the ocean off Waikiki. The last part sees Matt, Alex and Scottie all quiet and close together as just curl up on the coach to watch March of the Penguins together, sharing the quilt from Elizabeth's deathbed. Also starring Michael Ontkean as Cousin Milo and Matt Corboy as Cousin Ralph. Clooney is usually handsome and cool, here he is rugged, grey and uncool with baggy bits and his shirts tucked in, but that makes him all the more likable, and of course sympathetic in his grief, and many of the supporting cast members do well also, such as Lillard as the other man, Woodley as the opinionated teenage daughter, and even Krause as the amusing sometimes dim-witted and apathetic young man. I'll be honest in saying that I was not full interested in the landownership storyline, but the father who sees himself as the second-hand parent trying to connect with his daughters in the hard times, the husband finding and having words with the man who slept with his wife, and finally trying to find the strength to let her go, all of this creates genuine emotion, but there are also the amusing moments to cheer you up, it is a fantastic comedy drama. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Editing, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture ? Drama, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. George Clooney was number 72 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney has carved out a reputation for making interesting thoughtful films, clearly not interested in taking the easy superficial glamour route, he could so easily follow.In Director Alexander Paynes film, he is again all but shorn of his movie star persona and usual acting traits. Playing another everyman, this time in Hawaii, a glamorous location that Payne still manages to portray as almost anywhere. The same stresses, family troubles and tragedy, albeit with palm trees and better music.As the voice over intones, "My friends on the mainland think just because I live in Hawaii, I live in paradise. Like a permanent vacation. We're all just out here sipping Mai Tais, shaking our hips, and catching waves. Are they insane?" Lawyer Matt King (Clooney), is a loving albeit somewhat absent father to his two daughters and inattentive husband to sports loving Elizabeth (Hastie). He is a fundamentally good man, working hard to provide for his family but appears emotionally disconnected from them all.He also has money worries, not like most folk though. He is the sole trustee to a plot of land left to the family from descendants stretching back to 1860. A deal is in the offing, that will net some $500 million to be shared by him and his many extended family members. Understandably they are keen to sell, even if many locals are against the development deal.The catalyst for the journey we witness is a near fatal boating accident, leaving Elizabeth all but brain dead. Not a spoiler, as it's the first point of business in the film.The film is about the journey that Matt and his family take to reach some form of weak reconciliation or method of learning to trust and love each other again.Clooney is as good as he has ever been, confused, angry and clearly as a father, out of his depth. His enforced solo fatherhood role is not helped by his daughters. Scottie (Miller), the youngest is already trouble with potential for more, trouble that is. Alexandra (Woodley) has set the template Scottie is sure to follow, sullen, rude and not willing to play the game at all.The children are both excellent, notably Woodley who manages to just about pull off the feat of being obnoxious, yet likable at the same time. Her friend Sid (Krause) acting as a social hand grenade, saying inappropriate stuff but with the best of intentions.Not a lot happens but actually a lot happens courtesy of a smart script based on Kaui Hart Hemmings debut novel. Character arcs are followed, Alexandra's perhaps too fast but that is a small complaint. Clooney is believable and produces another worthy performance to add to his repertoire.It's also good to see Beau Bridges again, albeit in a small role.Summary A character study with inherent humour, drama and a strong central performance from Clooney.Not showy but a great watch for a more mature audience, a demographic largely ignored at the box office.Recommended http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very realistic movie with all of its beauty and all of its ugliness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants is a drama with a humorous side, about a man named Matt King (George Clooney) a Hawaiian attorney who is losing is wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) due to a horrific boating accident, she is left in a coma and he now has to deal with his two unruly daughters Alex (Shailene Woodley) and Scottie (Amara Miller) on his own, through the crisis of his wife's coma and eventual death. There are some interesting twists and turns as Matt deals with his in-laws and learns that his wife was having an affair before the accident. All the while trying to deal with a family's trust that leaves Matt, who is the trustee of his family's holdings of 25,000 acres of untouched pristine land on the island of Kauai to make a decision about selling the land and to whom to sell it to. He finds himself pulled between his family's interest in making money and what is the best thing to do for the people of Hawaii and the land itself. The movie opens with the main Character Matt King telling the audience that even though he lives in paradise life is all too real with all the ugliness and hardship that comes with being human, basically life is messy. In my opinion this is the basic theme of the film. This theme is reinforced with the contrast of the beautiful landscapes of Hawaii compared to the hospital room that his wife lies dying in, the room is exactly what a real hospital room looks like right down to the chipping paint on the hospital bed and the ugly art hanging on the wall. The settings in the film are very realistic, the pool is full of leaves and the living spaces all looked lived in, shoes on the porch and keys on the coffee table. I like the realistic settings compared to a lot of films where everything looks all to perfect. The theme is also reinforced in makeup and wardrobe and the use of natural lighting. No Hollywood glitter here, just real life and not the everyday life most of us are use to but island life. The clothing is very casual and not a lot of makeup is used, all the real beauty and all the real ugliness is there, right down to grandpas very pale legs, It was all very refreshing to see. If you liked the realistic humor of Garden State then you will like this movie.</fullReview>

Here is mine: Having gone through the loss of a spouse via hospital tubes, medication and end of life decision making, I was very impressed with Clooney's delivery of the complicated emotions undeniably attached. It's hard to describe how each twitch of his eyes,or rise of his chest with a breath,communicates just how the brain/thoughts process these heavy, heavy circumstances. I was thankful for the respect the director gave this unpopular subject, and it restores my faith that REAL life subjects can be explored and opened up for people to grow. KUDOS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Globally satisfying but weak plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main strong point of this film is that for once we are preserved from violence, blood, gore, sex and and special effects which have pervaded a large part of the cinema and can only quite frankly interest a limited number of people on the planet.Personally I have always been fascinated by Hawaii, but for a European this place is across the other side of the earth and very difficult to access. I am keen to visit the place to hear their music, eat the local delicacies and photograph the flowers and mountains. My uncle has a time-share there and he speaks some of the local language ! This film shows us a lot of different views of the islands and the climate, given the lush vegetation, seems to be quite changeable with an ever changing sky between rain and sun. One must suppose that one of the film's aims is to show that even in such a peaceful paradise such as Hawai'I, pain and grief are possible.The film's plot is very limited but Clooney's actor performance in the role assigned to him is very good indeed - for this reason at the end of the film, you feel "highly satisfied" which is not the same as "enthralled" : to feel the latter you would have needed a spicier plot which just wasn't there. As to Clooney's wife in the film ? I could not imagine being paid to act in a film and to spend the whole of that film motionless in a bed ? Could they not have used a lifelike dummy ?? As we never saw the woman "in action" during the film even by use of flashbacks, it is difficult for the spectator to feel any real emotion for her and we have more emotion in following the way Clooney apprehends the situation thrust upon him.One very negative point is the frequent use of absolutely foul and vulgar language by the children. Is this typical of American children nowadays ? Or was it exaggerated for the film ? Whatever the reply to that question, it does absolutely no good for the film at all and the only effect it would have would be to repulse certain would-be viewers who would have otherwise liked the film. How I relish the older films from the 1940's and 1950's where this filth was totally absent and the film far more enjoyable. Even in fighting/violent scenes, people seemed to control their language.A good point with "Descendants"was the lovely Hawaiian music ? I have collected quite a few CD's of this bought overseas and I am fascinated by the culture mix these islands have produced.Globally I have a satisfactory appreciation of the film which can be put down to Clooney's excellent performance and the magnificent surroundings and music and whilst you feel sad that the poor wife is confined to a bed with the unenviable prospect of death at the end of the tunnel, this sadness is tempered by the fact that we learn she was cheating on her husband. And cheating with who ? One of the killers from "Scream". Your emotions are slightly "numbed".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know anything about 'The Descendants' before I actually saw the film. The story is superb, by that I mean that it's so realistic that you think the film could be and probably is based on a true story. But, the story is a sad one in that Matt (George Clooney) is put in such a rare and horrible situation that you think no one should ever have to go through the same thing. It really made me wonder what I would do if I was in his shoes (I probably wouldn't have handled it so coolly). He's got hard-headed daughters and a tag along, moron teenager who is actually pretty lovable in the end.The acting from George Clooney and the rest of the cast was phenomenal. I must admit, I'm not a big Clooney fan but in this film, I forgot all about his 100 Sexiest Men award thing...whatever. He really pulled off a single father who tries to make it very, very well and it was really believable. I thought Shailene Woodley and Judy Greer were also great as King's stubborn daughters and were very convincing in their respectable roles. I must admit, I was surprised to see Matthew Lillard in this film but he was just as great, even though he only had one major scene. I wish there would have been more time with him on screen. I must also mention Beau Bridges role in the film wasn't so big but he was also unforgettable. (Beau is Jeff Bridges brother..I knew he looked familiar.) All in all, I think this film is one of the I've ever seen. I'll honestly say, I cried towards the end, which I've never done on any film in my entire life. I'm talking real drips. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie recently and i have to say i enjoyed it, but it had a very sad premise,and there is not a lot of comedy. Some people said that it didn't have much of story and they said it sounded corny( man angry with wife, cheating, but that part doesn't really matter, because after watching it, i couldn't point out any obvious flaws. Not once was i bored, it wasn't repetitive, it was original, and it showed both sides of the story, everyone was real. The acting was amazing, especially the kids, the scenery was amazing,and the music was enchanting. I would definitely watch it at least once, although you have to be in the mood to watch a sad film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whew! How nice to see a movie where the leading light is the story.And everything else follows so nicely, so well. Why do I like this flick so much? I think it's because it manages the tone so well. It ventures near the borders in all the right places: The necessary venality of Sid; the interminable crustiness of the grandfather; the strangely expected wisdom of the elder daughter; the ordinariness of the.... well, can't spoil it, so I can't complete that last bit. Suffice to say that, if mismanaged, the thing which turned out to be so ordinary would have otherwise dumped a unneeded burden of guilt and shame on Clooney's character, but as with so many of these delicious slices of verite, the pulling back from that brink is like yet-another azure wave receding from glimmering white sands.It's wonderfully produced, directed, acted. I loved the VO work; because the thing is, after all, a fine story, the VO feels right. I consider myself to be a pretty picky guy, and I could not detect a single false note in the whole work.The core message expands outward, embracing the setting, the islands, and the whole world. Including, if you let it, the tabernacle of your own heart.Watch, cry, laugh, enjoy.I would like to add a more pedestrian note: It really warms the cockles of my heart to see Clooney picking and choosing his roles with such a clear eye for quality, warmth, humanity, and artfulness, and having it obviously pan out for him so well. In this particular regard--showing that Hollywood can conduit talent toward the end of true film artistry--Clooney exemplifies the best that Hollywood can achieve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly one of the best written movies in recent history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie for the second time. I rented it after seeing it in theaters months earlier, and I have to say, it's even better the second time around. The Descendants is emotionally gripping and provocative on so many levels, not just because of the acting from the likes of George Clooney, but the entire supporting cast. But what really drove this movie home for me was the superb writing. The dialogue is so well placed and delectable, if not absolutely brilliant. It takes much skill to write a movie so emotionally distressing, yet humorously touching at the same time. I can't figure out how Alexander Payne and company fused those two aspects together so tastefully without sugarcoating anything to the viewer. This is mostly seen through Alex's character, who is portrayed spot on by Shailene Woodley, as the foul-mouthed, but pitiable daughter who helps Matt (Clooney) track down the man who had an affair with his wife, Brian Speer (Matthew Lilliard, in a refreshingly serious role considering his more recent poor comedic performances) I won't give away any more details for those of you reading who haven't seen this film yet, but the events that ensue make for one of the most entertaining, and in my opinion, one of the best movies of 2011. I have to say, if I could've voted for the winner of the Oscar for best picture, I would've voted for The Descendants. I've seen The Artist, and I don't want to take anything away from it, because I thoroughly enjoyed it as well, but personally I think the Descendants was the all-around best cinematic experience I had in all of 2011. This could possibly be one of the most underrated films of the year, regardless of its justly awarded Oscar for Best Screenplay, and I would highly recommended this to any serious movie-goer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: Matt King is a land baron and lawyer of mixed race living in Hawaai with his entire family, which includes all his cousins who have settled themselves at different spots around the place. After a freak boating accident, Matt's wife Elizabeth goes into a coma that may be permanent. Matt has to decide when to unplug her machine, plus he also has to break this news to his family and friends. His two daughters Alexandra and Scottie are out-of-control girls who were brought up mostly by Elizabeth. This makes 'back-up' parent Matt's situation harder, with his elder daughter Alex experimenting with drugs and older boys, and younger one turning more rebellious and crass after the mishap. He also has to decide, along with his cousins, whether or not and who to sell their inherited land before it is taken up by the trust fund.Review: Descendants will disappoint those expecting a fixed resolution to every theme it tackles, but does life ever bring a complete resolution to every deed committed by man? What solely matters is reconciling with the present and realizing a harmony with people whom we care for and who still co-exist with us. Most viewers, including me at first, were waiting for a big bang in the film where the protagonist Matt King confronts his weaknesses and mistakes and faces a nervous breakdown. Most wanted King to suffer for neglecting his wife, thus making her lonely and seeking for love outside marriage. But director Alexander Payne doesn't want to make this the focal point of the story because the affair is now an affair of the past and what is necessary now is to fix the present for a better future. And Matt's present has setbacks in the form of two unruly children who face adversity in coping with the present because of their past. Matt King isn't a terrible husband and father but is rather an irresponsible one; therefore Payne wants us to cheer for him as he attempts to accept his duties as a father. And I feel audiences have this reluctance in embracing this optimism, but they must keep in mind that Elizabeth King's accident and the revelation itself are the low points in Matt's life and Payne doesn't intend to crumble his life further.The land baron, in a quest to reconcile with his children, also develops virtues such as forgiveness, empathy, righteousness, harmony, something that he had turned indifferent to because of his work and land dealings. His cousins conflict with one another on the matter of selling their sprawling land areas to developers which may reap them vast fortunes. In the beginning Matt describes himself as a stingy man whom the ultimate verdict depends upon but he seems indecisive in the whole matter. However, as begins understanding himself as a man, a father and a Hawaain citizen, his thinking becomes more resolute, much to the annoyance of his greedy and guileful cousin Hugh. Also, his confrontation with the Brian Speer doesn't end up in a messy showdown because Matt himself had realized that despite being faithful, he wasn't devoted to his wife. Plus Speer isn't the quintessential bad guy set out to ruin others' lives.Clooney again shows why he is the most popular American actor; he may not be as versatile as some of his contemporaries but he can play his characters instinctively. He does manage to stoop slightly and walk like a man in his fifties, and also speaks with more restraint and laid-backness which reminded me of an uncle of mine, but most importantly, he hits you with his spontaneous gush of emotions. Like the scene where the doctor tells him about his wife's helpless condition. Or the times where he is helpless at his daughters' peevishness. He keeps us on the story's tracks and therefore we are able to decipher the writer's/director's message rather too carried away with the actor's performance. The latter happens with stalwart Meryl Streep who can make us forget the film (and its flaws) itself with her heavenly performances. Besides Clooney, the jolly ensemble includes Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller who play two volatile, vacuous teenagers with piercing accuracy, Matthew Lillard who doesn't overdo his nervous act and also manages to make us laugh, and a whole set of people who bring humanness to the film. Two thumbs up to Beau Bridges for his canny portrayal of glib and specious cousin Hugh. And Sid is the most spaced out guy I've seen since Crispin Glover's bizarre act in River's Edge.It is difficult to define the style of the film in set terms but I think the adjectives 'temperate', 'flowing', 'bittersweet', 'joyful', 'optimistic' can be attributed. The movie progresses like those calm waves with slight ruffles that end up cooling our feet as we stand close to the shore end. It is like the moving hips of a female Hula dancer, gentle and graceful but hypnotic nevertheless. The color tone of the film itself is so cool, earthy and verdant, you can imagine staying on such an island, sitting casually and care-freely under the shades of a beach-side restaurant or bar, legs stretched out and sipping on a juicy Mai Tai as a local band plays its traditional music in the background. At such places, even if you are in a volatile state, the ambiance around you itself cools down your volatility. This is also why Payne didn't go for scenes too intense and painful. The only minor problem I had was the closing scene: King here sits with his two daughters on the couch watching March of the Penguins. I rather wanter King to camp with his daughters and neighbors Kai and Mark at the spot where they had been earlier. I remember Scottie telling her dad how it had been years since they had camped and they share their memories; it would've been a fitting ending for the movie.My Rating: 8.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better without Pre-conceived Notions!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a sad thing that most of us usually come to generate our interest about most of the movies only after their participation or victory in film festivals and annual awards. The downside of such is that we usually already make up our mind to expect a certain level of film-making and story-telling and when the movie doesn't deliver one or the other aspect of that, we begin to jot down what the movie lacked - from our assumptions, of course. So don't compare this title with any of your per-conceived notions or any other title as such; if you were.A beautiful movie, slow-paced story-telling, technically alright, and a good cast. This movie lacked perfection in many things, dialogues, cinematography, acting and so on and guess that's why it related to us in a better way. This movie is a lyric especially with the over-powering background score that sometimes was annoying, honestly. This is no unreal movie with fantasy islands, miracle workers, or super-smart kids. It's just a regular Joe whom we all love! To sum it up, a good movie to watch on DVD with kids on a lazy Sunday if you are friends with your teenagers. It sucks them in, for good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle, real, human. An (un)American classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It doesn't surprise me that there are so many bad reviews for this film, because it must be totally alien for American viewers to see a film that doesn't have gun splatters, vampires, softcore porn or fart jokes. This is subtle, real and human, even for an Alexander Payne film. Far more European than American, yet utterly American. It's even difficult to pin down the genre. It's got the structure of a classic comedy, it certainly has humorous moments; yet it never plays it more than real. Without going too much into the story?because to do so would give too much away?every scene from the beginning is unexpected, every character takes unexpected turns and every actor is believable as the character they play. So many Hollywood films are merely an escape from life, so it's refreshing to see a film that allows you to explore your own life. I do believe every Alexander Payne film has been better than the last, and hope there are many more to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very nice, slow-moving family drama that has many funny parts also.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been a well-advertised movie, with its one Oscar win and several nominations including best actor and best picture. So I was prepared to be let down, as often happens. (Think "Life is Beautiful" and "Crouching Tiger" for examples.)But I wasn't let down, this is an excellent movie. It has little action, it develops slowly, but it is all about family and relationships. My wife and I enjoyed it a lot.All filmed in Hawaii, the movie opens with a scene of a woman in a boat, moving very fast, then we find her in a coma in a hospital bed after the accident. Her husband is George Clooney as Matt King. Matt has a successful law practice but perhaps more significant, at least to this story, he is the sole executor of a very large parcel of virgin Hawaiian land that has been passed down for 150 years. He and his cousins are the "descendants" and now with laws changing they have to figure out what to do with the land. Selling it to a conglomerate for a golf course and resort for upwards of a half-billion dollars seems like the most likely approach, regardless each one of them will be wealthy beyond their dreams.Matt eventually finds out his wife will never wake up. She has a living will which specifies that she not be simply kept alive with machines, instead she will be unplugged, allowed to die, and her organs donated. So much of the story has her immediate family preparing for that event, while all the cousins press Matt for his decision on the land.Matt's two daughters are Shailene Woodley playing a character her age (19) as Alexandra King. She is off to an institute on another island, and has been acting up for a while. We find out it is because she discovered her mom having an affair with a real estate agent and she was angry with mom about that. The other daughter is younger, Amara Miller as Scottie King. Another teenage actor with a funny role is Alex's friend, Nick Krause as Sid, who too often seems to say the wrong thing.Clooney is very good in this, as are the other cast members. It movies deliberately but always interestingly and has what I think is a good resolution.SPOILERS: As the story develops Matt finds out the real estate agent having the affair with his wife is a relative of the likely buyer of the land and stands to profit greatly from sales commissions. It is not at all clear if that was the reason for the affair, as he did not profess love for Matt's wife, but it was the catalyst for Matt's thinking more about the land, its connection with his ancestry, and the fact that they were just looking at it as "money." He told the others they were entrusted with the land, and he decided not to sell it. They had 7 more years to figure out how to do this, but Matt was determined to keep the land.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well made and subtly good family drama, but slightly overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is about a husband who's wife suffers a serious accident and is unlikely to pull through. He suddenly finds himself needing to be a single parent to his daughters (after not being a very attentive father), discovering his wife's betrayal and having to tell everyone she's dying. I like the fact that the film doesn't gloss over all the ugliness and conflicting emotions one goes through in this situation; anger, frustration, sadness and helplessness. Clooney takes you through the range of them and convincingly so. He does subtly portray an every day man trying to get through it and handle it the best he can without losing his dignity. One of is better performances. But I have to say I'm surprised he got the Golden Globe; Brad Pitt's performance in Moneyball and Jean Dujardin in The Artist were clearly superior and I preferred Clooney's performance in Up in the Air much more because that felt a bit more believable to me. With that said, I still liked the film. I loved the cinematography. The beauty of the islands were captured really well in the film, so much so it was like I was there. And those scenes really highlighted some of the reflective family moments in the film (and in my opinion felt the most real). While there were very few moments that moved me it's still worth watching. At the end of the film I had to ask myself how excited am I to watch this again? And my answer was not very much and that's why this film is a bit over rated in my opinion. A 2nd viewing will probably be warranted and maybe more effective; it seems this is a bit of a personal film for some and I probably can't really relate as much say someone with children or someone who's been in a similar situation.www.themoviesnob.ca@the_movie_snob</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clooney Undone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that could have been made maudlin with the wrong approach. It's a story of redemption. It's unpredictable and absorbing. Clooney must deal with his comatose, brain dead wife, who has injured herself seriously through her own recklessness. The interesting thing is that they didn't have the greatest relationship in the first place. He is a workaholic and has ignored her. He can't go back and probably wouldn't, given a chance. He has two daughters, both of whom are little whack jobs, filled with Angst and self-centeredness. When Clooney finds out the man with whom she has had a tried affair, he goes ballistic. At first this is really about him and his own hurt, but he is heading down the road to destruction and had better watch himself. The family goes on a trip, basically to find the other man and they bring along a ding dong boyfriend of one of the daughters. He is thick as a brick but we find, as with most people, something lies beneath the surface. Clooney has a dignified insensitivity where this guy is right out there. I just can't believe that some people found this boring. It's a tour de force for Clooney, one of America's treasures. It shows that in life there are no simple answers and things don't always get tied up with a ribbon. This movie haunts me because it's the kind of thing that could happen to anyone. There is a subplot about some incredible real estate, and that becomes the center point in Clooney's longings to do right. See this. It's moving and salient.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Knew Hawaii Is So Depressing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening sequence of "The Descendants", where George Clooney narrates all the thoughts and ideas that never come to one's mind when thinking about Hawaii, which is for most the epitome or paradise on Earth, made me like this movie instantly! I fervently hoped that Gary Oldman would win the Best Actor Oscar for his astounding performance in "Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy", but seeing Clooney's masterful performance in "The Descendants" made me root for him also. I thought, if the Oscars prove to be as predictably disappointing as they have become and Oldman did not win, I held some hope that at least Clooney's performance would get recognized. Alas, Hollywood's fetish with "The Artist" a high-gloss self-addressed statement of self-loving, only served to reinforce Hollywood's narcissism by dutifully ignoring far better movies and performances."The Descendants" is yet another wonderful check-mark in the win column for one of the best American directors working today, Alexander Payne. The lack of recognition from the Academy and other movie organizations, cannot dampen the quality and originality of this film."The Descendants" is the portrait of a family after a life-altering, or life-shattering, event in the lives of ALL its members, set against the backdrop of painful revelations, hard truths and inescapable conclusions. At times sad, funny, lovely, beautiful and profound, this movie is part life-lesson, part comedy, part entertainment and part love-letter to Hawaii.Great cast, wonderful cinematography, great direction and if this is any indication, hopefully Clooney and Payne will collaborate on future projects.Please watch "The Descendants" and do yourself a favour...support quality for a change...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alexander Payne has a fantastic eye for characters, and his movies are completely driven by them. "About Schmidt" has been high on my list of favourites for a long time, and it really has almost no story at all, but Jack Nicholson's performance in the title role shows an amazing balance between the ridiculous and the sublime."The Descendents" might just rank as Payne's best, because the whole film is populated by characters that are as well-written. Clooney is great in this, showing a vulnerability and at times even an awkwardness that is not what we typically expect in his performances.I find some of the creative choices here interesting; some of the most important events happen off-camera, leaving the movie to focus not so much on what happens, but on how everyone reacts to it. I found this movie to have some of the most memorable, authentic characters I've seen in years....and I love the way Hawaii is filmed in this movie. It isn't any deliberate attempt to show it badly, but you see things like suburbs, and freeways, and skyscrapers that don't normally make it into a "Hawaii" movie. Not to say that there aren't other, more scenic shots, and I liked the balance. In this way, Hawaii itself becomes something of a character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A human drama that is both intimate and epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the tradition of "Kramer vs. Kramer" and "Ordinary People," "The Descendants" is a high-toned social drama centered around the complex dynamics of familial relationships. Like those other films, it also won wide critical praise and a boatload of award nominations the year it was released.Matt King is a wealthy, workaholic businessman living in Hawaii with his wife and two daughters, the older of whom is a rebellious teen who's recently been shipped off to boarding school on another island. As the movie opens, we learn that Matt's world has begun to crash in on him big time as his wife lies in a coma brought on by a boating accident. Matt struggles not only with the guilt of having been an emotionally distant husband but with raising two precocious and challenging children, who are deep in the throes of typical growing pains and whom he barely seems to know at this point. He also has to deal with the complications of selling some of the valuable property he inherited from his wealthy ancestors to developers who may not be as attuned as he is to the natural beauty and ecological richness of the land.With a thoughtful and insightful screenplay by Nat Faxon, Jim Rash and director Alexander Payne, based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, the movie neatly sidesteps all the potential melodrama inherent in the material. The plot constantly wanders off onto interesting and unexpected bypaths, and characters who seem as if they could become easily pigeonholed refuse to do or say what we expect them to do or say. No one is a hero or a villain; they're all just ordinary folks trying to lead decent lives, though often falling far short of that mark, as we all do. Indeed, there is an air of verisimilitude to this film that is a rare commodity in modern commercial movie-making. At every moment, we feel as if are watching real people acting in real ways - just as if actual life were unfolding before us. In fact, there is not a single false moment to be found anywhere in the film.This is thanks, in no small measure, to George Clooney who has never given a truer or more deeply vulnerable performance than he does here, utilizing his innate good-guy persona to astonishing effect. Ditto for Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller who play his two daughters with unerring believability and conviction. Their interactions with one another are indeed a wonder to behold.With admirable restraint, director Alexander Payne is content to let the drama speak for itself. He has the decency to pull back and give the characters their space without feeling it necessary to push his points or exploit the audience's emotions. Yet, there is a lovely, hypnotic flow to the movie that draws us into both the tropical setting (how many movies set in Hawaii are about people who actually live there?) and the lives of these ordinary people who are suffering through an extraordinary - yet, at the same time, utterly universal - ordeal.A human drama that is as intimate as it is epic, "The Descendants" is one of the most profound and moving film-going experiences of recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our future is in our farewell to the dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A strange film indeed echoing The Tree of Life. Has the West in its vast financial, debt and economic crisis become absolutely morbid when having to face the loss of its hegemony in the world? I believe so and there are two attitudes possible.Either you refuse it and you get angry and you start accusing everyone and the whole world of some kind of plot against you, like in Greece and you burn the central public library. That's the choice of the wife of the lover of the dying wife-mother-daughter-cousin-relative of the main male character marvellously rendered by Clooney.Or you start taming your anger and looking beyond this narrow-minded reaction and you try to come to terms with the situation, with death, with an affair, with so many things that should not prevent life from going on. Because life has to go on, even in Spain, Italy, Ireland, France and elsewhere in this Western world.And the choice is personal and has to be negotiated in the film by a middle-aged widowed husband and father; by a teenage daughter that had difficult relations with the mother; by a young daughter who is still a child and does not even know what death is; by the lover who loved or did not love but used the wife before her death and implanted in her some mirage; by the wife of that occasional and indelicate lover; by the members of the fund that is supposed to take care of a big chunk of one of the Hawaiian islands, a territory that is still virginal and is greedily desired by some real estate developer whose brother in law is the indelicate lover; by so many other people around that comatose woman who signed her will to be unplugged if she was to get into such a situation.Parting from the dying, nearly dead person is always difficult and Clooney and his fellow actors or family members play that drama, that painful trauma with the dignity and the restraint necessary to make it poignant without making it melodramatic. Just for that reason you should see that film and enjoy it. Take it as a good preparation for the traumas, personal, national or universal, that may happen tomorrow at sunrise, if not before.It is not the Tree of Life, but the Tree of Death that goes on growing beyond death because Death is Life and Life never stopped in front of Death.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not only George Clooney who's delivering, it's every other actor in this too. The script has a major part in this, because it does actually convey and portray the characters in it with some strong components. Like the guy/character played by Krause. He's mad funny to the viewer, but the character does not realize that. He's not saying those things, because he wants to be funny, he's just genuine.Having said that, there is also drama to be found in here, but mostly this is light fare and it suits the movie well. It's also nice to see the guy who became famous with Scream back on track with a really good role on his hands (yes he can act! Shame they wouldn't let him do it that often. Surely Wing Commander cannot be seen as a further example of that). Cinematography and direction are great, so I can only recommend this to you as have quite a few others here :o)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is about a man who lost his his wife recently and discovered her secret relationship with another guy. With his kids that he didn't spent too much time with, he starts a new life with different priorities. The overall movie was nice but not the best movie of the year or the best performance of Clooney. I have seen a lot of movies of him and he even looked bored in this movie. Anyways, if you like drama and looking for a movie that you can watch as a family, go for it. The music is nice, scenery is beautiful and story is fine. The biggest downside is, it is long and sometimes gets really boring. Nevertheless, it is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly heartfelt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants cast a spell over me.I got a thorough inappropriate kick out of it. Inappropriate. Yes, inappropriate. This film was unlike any other film I've ever seen. Alexander Payne (Director and Screenplay writer) presented us with a series of nerve racking anecdotes which left me snickering on the outside, while basically convulsing on the inside! I found this film to be terribly funny. Funny in a way, that I felt kind of guilty for even thinking it was funny. After some reflection (deep), I realized, I laughed because all the characters in The Descendants had to act inappropriately - and they did it so f'n well. This film won the 'Best Writing for an Adapted Screenplay' Oscar and furthermore, was nominated for 4 Academy Awards, which included 'Actor In a Leading Role' for the oh-so-statuesque, GOD - Mr. Clooney.The story revolves around Matthew King (Clooney) and his family. After his wife, Elizabeth (Hastie), ends up in hospital, he is left looking after his two daughters. Scottie (Miller) the youngest, cracked me up. She seemed to express genuine curiosity and ignorance. Honesty. And I just kept on thinking about that one person, we all know one, who asks all the wrong questions, all. the. time. She is relatively new to the acting scene, but I think she did really okay. And then there is other daughter, Alexandra (Woodley). Such a beautiful woman. And in The Descendants, the ultimate dark horse. She seemed to be into all sorts of bad things, she seemed like the ultimate super brat, but I ended up loving her character.Even though King is left with the daunting task of looking after his daughters, he has to run his law practice and oversee plans for the selling of a piece of land which belongs to his extended family and himself. All this while waging war with his own conscience.Adding to the inappropriate feel of this film, comes along, Nick Krause as Sid. He depicts the dude-character, speaking in bumpersticker and generally just being the boy any father would hit over the head with a surfboard. It's like his character was basically just created to annoy Clooney's character, but in the end, I felt he snuggled his way right into King's heart.And finally, the man, George Clooney. The first time one hears him in this film, he introduces us to his 'paradise' and drops the F-bomb. Ha. (And yes, I felt the swearing was appropriate.) He played the 'dad' and 'husband' brilliantly. His franticness, his impulsiveness and his raw emotion streamed from the screen and washed over me. Oh, and might I add, Scooby-Doo's Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) makes an appearance too, which seems weirdly too appropriate seeing as he is so, like, the dude and The Descendants was shot in Hawaii.Well, I must say The Descendants was a pretty funny movie. I loved it. I've seen it twice now and I definitely loved it even more the second time, who knows how the third time will pan out. If you are looking for a surprisingly heartfelt, inappropriate movie, do yourself a favor and get this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sentimental, slow; nice Clooney performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mild, general spoilers follow, but nothing you wouldn't find out within the first fifteen minutes of the film. The value of this review is purely that it's written from the standpoint of someone who rarely watches anything but action/adventure films. I did like this piece, although it was marred (specifically the DVD I rented from RedBox) by a long string of unskippable trailers.Descendants is a dual-themed film that's, on the one hand, about a large extended family that has held sizable chunks of Hawaiian land for a number of generations, and which is collectively contemplating the sale of the last big chunk of that land. The sole trustee/executor of the estate, played by George Clooney, a lawyer, is putting the family through the paces of figuring out what to do, initially without a lot of concern about the outcome (which comes to a vote at the end of the film).Interwoven with this first theme is another theme - really the primary focus of the film - namely the grief of Clooney's character and his two daughters over the loss of their mother and his discovery that she had had an affair.Clooney is terrific as a well-meaning but disengaged father and husband who struggles with the dysfunction of the people around him - and who recognizes the hand he's played in it. Basically we get to watch him, as the film plays out, work out a kind of truce with his kids and make peace with himself and his wife.I would never have watched this movie if I'd seen a review like this, so let me just add that it's a decent enough film to have engaged me, mostly, despite the fact that it's thickly sentimental at times, slow, and not my genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched this drama with my mom on a Netflix disc. George Clooney plays a lawyer in Hawaii who has a comatose wife. He discovers something about her from his eldest daughter that leads him to question why certain things happened when she was still active. That's all I'll say about that except that Alexander Payne has directed quite a touching drama that deserved the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay that he wrote. There's also some pretty good supporting performances by Beau Bridges, Robert Forster, and Judy Greer, the latter being quite wonderfully surprising to me since I usually think of her a comedic actress. In summary, I highly recommend The Descendants.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As real as it gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Descendants', based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, focuses on Matt King (George Clooney), a lawyer, who has to cope with the turmoil caused as his wife, Elizabeth, is in a coma, following an accident. There is also his teenage daughter, Alex 's (Shailene Woodley) defiance, his 10 year old daughter, Scotty's (Amara Miller) improper behavior and a decision about selling a family-owned 25,000 acres piece of land of which he is the sole trustee. And all this happens in beautiful, breathtaking Hawaii. Matt is a committed lawyer who wasn't always there for his wife and daughters. As such, he is forced to re-examine his life after his wife's accident. But is it too late to make up for things? The film's serious subject-matter is balanced with comical moments provided mainly by Alex's friend, Sid. Clooney delivers a masterful performance as a father who is trying so hard to deal with the various aspects of his life turned upside down. Special mention to Woodley, whose portrayal of a rebellious teenage daughter could not have been more believable. And that's exactly what the film is ? believable, real and emotional.Zero melodrama, just the right amount of humor, a fine screenplay and the raw performances all make this Oscar-winning film worth watching. Watch the movie to reflect on the intricacies of life, to appreciate good filmmaking and to realize just what emotions a movie can make you feel. What Matt King as well as his daughters seek for in 'The Descendants' is closure. Do they get it? You'll have to watch the movie to find out.Bottomline:'The Descendants' is a wonderful portrayal of real life, pieced together beautifully and acted out impeccably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Idealistic Approach to a Realistic Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the most common problems dealt with by the average American family are at play in this film, and they are portrayed in a surprisingly honest light. Nothing too over the top, nothing sugarcoated, and just enough believable plot to keep the interpersonal dynamics in play...In real life, a family as problematic as this one is usually stuck on a path in which all members are slowly but surely gaining distance from each other. In the movie, we see this start to change as the father figure patiently abides in his loving care for his daughters, a responsibility he now must face alone, with his wife on the edge of death throughout the film. Even though he is helpless against the forces working against him, his timid love is shown in many ways to be the catalyzing factor towards the positive changes that take place in his family. By the end of the film, you might even say his love has become steadfast and courageous, although this might contradict the genuinely humble disposition he has come to inhabit.Far too often we see realistic depictions of problems in families leading to partisan relationships between the adults and the children, as if any problematic situation automatically entails that both parties be pitted against each, in a cosmic battle akin to that of good versus evil, until one or the other finally submits under the pressure. That cathartic moment usually comes at the end of most movies, whereas in this film, the responsibility of a good example is placed in the hands of the father figure, and he doesn't resort to frustration every time his children show disrespect. Unfortunately, it seems that a present, patient, and loving leader of a family is far too much to ask for in today's "busy society," a society rationalized by our rampant materialism. Fortunately, this movie seems to be doing a good job of arguing that it's not too much to ask.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No one has any redeeming qualities in this movie. That usually doesn't bother me, but these people are jerks! They all got me really angry. But the believable family dysfunction is what makes this movie so good. Despite disliking everyone, I thought the movie was real good. That one of my problem with last year's Best Picture Nominee, 'The Kids are Alright.' Everyone in that movie was too likable, so the dysfunction wasn't believable. This year, many people were rooting for The Help, which is really good, but I just think Descendants was better. An underdog story like The Help is easy to root for.To pull of a believable dysfunctional family is more difficult. In the Descendants you eventually do make an emotional investment and gain compassion despite the unlikable characters. This is one of the things 'Precious' had going for it a few years ago.I know 'The Artist' won, but I think the Descendants was the best picture of all the nominees.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney continues to impress and amaze in this sometime sad, sometime delightful story of a father reuniting with his family. This role is reminiscent of his role in "One Fine Day" with Michelle Pfeiffer, but offers a little less wit and a little more maturity.Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller are excellent as the two daughters, with Shailene demonstrating a savvy wisdom in her delivery of lines most adults would find difficult.Robert Forster plays the wife's father, and he gives us an insight that most people would find rare, the father who trusts his son-in-law and cares for his wife at home in her battle with Alzheimer disease.All of the characters in this film are dealing with dramatic changes in their lives, and their interactions and decisions are really what we empathize with.This kind of film has to connect with the audience, and this one does an excellent job.Special hats off to Matthew Lillard, a young star of the past whose appearances have been fewer and fewer of late, and to Beau Bridges, who as Cousin Hugh reminds us that we all have a Cousin Hugh in the family.Rated R for language and sexual references, I think most families will agree this is a film for the teens, especially for families who have had to deal with loss. Definitely collectible for Clooney fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy? Not in My Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young woman out of Hawaii has written her first novel on which this film is based. While I have not read the novel the film is an interesting contrast from the normal type of entertainment. It is not often that tragedy and Hawaii are put together in the same venue. That is almost certainly one of the appeals of the novel too.The story of the movie almost exclusively involves rich people and a family that is rich. At least they are going to be rich as they are considering selling 25,000 acres of Hawaii real estate they inherited. George Clooney plays Matt King, and while he is smug, his character has reason to be. Besides being a Lawyer, he is the focus of a decision on selling the family inheritance, 25,000 acres of prime Hawaii real estate.Patricia Hastie, in one of the shorter film roles ever is shown alive briefly on water skis. The rest of the movie she is in a hospital bed in a coma. It is the result of an accident on the water skis and she has hit her head.Shailene Woodley plays oldest daughter Alexandra whose last pre-coma encounter with mom was a fight after she caught mom with her lover. Nick Krause plays Sid, the comic relief and Alexandra's boyfriend though the way he is scripted, it is kind of like having the boyfriend from another planet. Sid acts like a major jerk for the first half of the film, and does not really quite make up for it the last half of the film. Still, the very little comedy is supposed to be from him. Woodley almost steals this film from Clooney at points.Amara King in her first screen role Scottie King is good, but she is left out of the script at times.Still, a decent acting job by the youngster as the King's youngest daughter.The plot seems to unload on Matt King as everything bad a father can face almost happens. Still he manages to keep going through the adversity. The thing is, in a way you need the hankies here much more that you need the laughter which is forced at times with the R-Rated Language.As long as you don't get caught with the phony Comedy Label, you might enjoy this one. Hawaii is looking good, which is the usual. The films does depict some twisting plot drama but Misses a few major twists towards the end that might have made it even more potent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alexander Payne (About Schmidt, Sideways) took on a role that I never seen a director do in years and actually make a drama/comedy that's both heartbreaking yet funny at the same time.The movie centers on Matt King who's wife was in a severe boating accident that caused her to be in a very fatal coma. And we see the days of him trying to connect with people, such as friends, his daughters, that he was so distant with, and gain that connection back because he doesn't know if his wife would wake up or not. He also had to deal with selling his 25,000 acres of land that's left to him, while on the course of this journey, finds out his wife was having an affair on him with a real estate agent, and we see that play out through the movie.The Descendants for me at least, is really a hard movie to watch, there's just so much going on emotionally, like your heart just pours for the characters, and while at times their not at all likable, you can feel the pain they are going through, and watching them go through it is where the brilliance of Alexander Payne comes in, to direct these actors and their reactions is probably one of the most brilliant things I've seen in such a long time.The cast is exceptional, from George Clooney, Shaliene Woodley, Amara Miller, Robert Forster, to Mathew Lillard. Phenomenal performances from everyone, George Clooney definitely, that man gets a lot of credit for other films, but in here, gives one of the best performances he's done.This movie is probably the most emotional roller coaster ride I've been in, but there's a lot to take in from The Descendants, a lesson about connection, family, past, and the future. Just a brilliant and exceptional film! 10/10</fullReview>

Surely we should thank the two leads, George Clooney and Shailene Woodley, and the director, Alexander Payne, who is also listed as one of the screenwriters, but clearly this movie shows tender loving care by far more than three people. Kaui Hart Hemmings wrote the book from which it is derived and has to be congratulated even though her very brief appearance in the movie as Clooney's character's secretary, 9 minutes into the movie, is way too brief.The setting of Hawaii is a moving one. The music some of the most appropriate I've ever heard in any movie, bar none. All the acting is top notch and fully committed to achieving something special. They succeed as if they had thought this was everyone's last chance to leave their mark. No wonder its been included in so many favorites lists. My wife who loves human drama was riveted to the screen throughout. And yet the whole thing is as light as angel cake.Despite the occasional swear word I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie to anyone old enough to be exposed to a memorable depiction of the loss of a loved one. The way Clooney's character deals with the handful his daughters are, is worth the price of admission all by itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumph in cinema, beautiful and amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Descendants" is as much of an Alexander Payne experiment as it is a great film. Of course, the audience can notice some of Payne's trademarks: irony, themes of infidelity, heavy voice-over in the beginning, and, of course, satirical depictions of contemporary American society, like social disconnection and the effect of sexual excess on morality. What's so unbelievable is that this film is about an unstable man attempting to raise an unstable family in the midst of unstable situations, yet it still manages to feel so real and authentic.First of all, there is much more musical background than Payne's other films. It may very well be the first mainstream American film to use an exclusively Hawaiian soundtrack, and every song goes well with every scene that it's used in, whether they may include Hawaiian chants or slack-key guitars.Next is the variety of fine acting performances. Clooney has seldom been better. Probably at an incredibly close second place is Shailene Woodley's breakout performance as Matt King (Clooney)'s daughter, Alexandra. There are even supporting characters that are convincing, such as the actors of Brian Speer and Sid.The first third of "The Descendants" is mainly introductory. However, it ends with a part where Matt King is yelling at his wife, which seems unrealistic, considering she's comatose. Even if she did cheat on him, the raising voice can be unnecessary. However, that's just an example of the outstanding character development that Clooney's acting assists with: King is a difficult man not to like, no matter how unfortunately unapologetic he may be towards some people.With the second half being one of the greatest modern parts of a film in recent memory, it is much better than the first half and carries more emotion, with originality, drama, and dark comedy. With a double-ending, "The Descendants" has a both happy and sad end to it.Overall, it captures the ups-and-downs of life, and while it could contain more Hawaiian culture besides scenery and clothing, "The Descendants" is still an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The DescendantsTracing your family tree is only a fun experience up until you reach the branch where all of the murderers are.Fortunately, for the family man in this drama, his Hawaiian ancestors got extremely rich off of real estate. A minimal husband and father, Matt (George Clooney), must now cope with family (Amara Miller, Shailene Woodley) and friends after a boating accident leaves his wife in a coma.Meanwhile, a billion-dollar land claim entrusted to him is set to expire, leaving him to decide on whom he and his relatives should sell to.What's more, he learns of his wife's promiscuity and sets out to confront her lover (Matthew Lillard).A disarming drama with a comedic tinge, The Descendants' paradisal backdrop blends seamlessly with its dour content.Incidentally, a white man owning property on a Hawaiian island is almost as rare as a Hawaiian becoming the President of the United States of America.

		<fullReview>You cannot escape life, and there's no paradise, where to feel free from the hard strokes of life: that's the point of this movie, and this point comes out very clearly since from the first shots, when a voice over explains that living in Hawai is not all surfing and sunbathing, but here people suffer like in any other part of the world. The story in itself is dramatic, but always keeping director Alexander Payne's humor and irony intact. The character of Matt shows a strong human insight , Clooney's interpretation never disappoints and here quite surprisingly abandons some his undeniable charm to become a real middle-age and rather decadent father and husband, at a difficult crossroads in his life. But the greatest or at least most surprising performances are offered by the younger cast, especially by Shailene Woodley as the tormented teenager Alexandra, whose interpretation of a very difficult role proves really mature and noteworthy. On the whole, a well built and solidly directed movie, supported by a strong cast, sometimes too slow and maybe too long, but never boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone on IMDb used a curious word to describe "The Descendants", I was puzzled first but the more I thought of it, the more I realized how fitting it was: 'relaxing'. Indeed, for all the drama and all the emotionality the movie contained, it managed to find the perfect dosage with comedy, in order to keep our hearts hooked and our minds in harmony with the lead character, Matt King, played by George Clooney, in what will be his most memorable performance for ages. Maybe the Hawaiian setting played a significant part to that feeling, but apart from the escapist value of the film, It's not 'postcard' Hawaii that is featured here, skies are gray and there's no more bright sun there than sexy mermaids sunbathing on the beaches, but it's probably the portrayal which is the most faithful to reality.Matt King, along with countless cousins, a running-gag consist of starting their names with Cousin, is the descendant of one of the first land owner in Hawaii, he's a lawyer in Honolulu and he's officially the sole trustee of a family trust owning a part of unoccupied Paradise in an island named Kaua'i. Before the trust expire in seven years because of the rule against perpetuity, the Kings decided to sell it to a businessman named Holitzer, which would constitute a great opportunity for tourism and economical development. The Kings are Hawaiian by heart, their ancestor was a Hawaiian princess, and they believe in their attachment to their Island and its traditions. And this is one of the film's strengths, like Allen's "Manhattan" or Fellini's "Roma", the setting is not just original, it's part of the story as it's impossible to imagine it elsewhere. A few movies are so defined by their location, and feature characters so rooted in their traditions. And this is another strength of "The Descendants": the characters. The movie handles very archetypal situations, the theme of the father-too-busy to take care of his girls and having to endure their attitudes: Alex, the teenager with authority issues and Scottie, the child with destructive behavior, Sid the typical teenage boyfriend ? the movie doesn't go without deja- vu situations. However, all the characters here are real, and no part of their insolence is to be taken for granted. Everybody has a past, something that conditioned a personality, and they're all connected to each other. The movie starts with the thrill-loving face of Elizabeth, the mother and the shot after, she's in a comatose state, we understand that she's victim of an accident and later, the doctor tells Matt that there's no hope for her, and they must let her die peacefully. Although she's virtually absent in the plot, the mother is the emotional core of the film as we learn more about her as the movie progresses, and her past indirectly reveals the past of the others and the roots of their behaviors. Through Elizabeth, we understand the reason of Alex's anger and what lead her family to become so dysfunctional. Matt is the living proof that a good man doesn't necessarily make a good parent, and he's held responsible for Elizabeth's state by his father-in-law, remarkably played by Robert Forster. Never would have Elizabeth been pushed to that situation, to that motorboat fatal accident, if Matt was less careless about his couple. The irony in Matt is that he's often blamed for what he didn't do instead of what he did, and although he's not without a responsibility, he's still the victim of circumstances. When he learned from Alex, that Elizabeth cheated on her, his grief turned into a ferocious anger rarely displayed in a film, and in a way, it helped to fill his time by trying to find the identity of his rival, if only for telling him that the woman he used to destroy a family ?involuntarily, but the results are the same- is in the verge of death, and like all the other friends, he owed her a last visit. At least, she deserves that respect since the Family obviously doesn't. Matt's journey doesn't have a clear direction except to set all the parameters in order to let his wife die in peace, his interaction with his rival, shows how noble he's became in adversity, and interestingly, the trip is set in the very Island he must sell, which allows the daughters to see a part of themselves a last time before it's sold. We don't have time to question how the two plots will eventually connect, Alexander Payne has a way to play with his characters that lets you enjoy their evolution, their interaction and emotion without waiting for 'something to happen', like in "About Schmidt", each trip, each travel is an occasion for a human being to discover a way to become better, and the relaxing effect comes from the feeling that all these flawed and tormented characters we saw in the beginning, from Max to Scottie, from Alex to her friend Sid, would certainly come back as better people, and if not better, more in peace with themselves. The cathartic effect of "The Descendants" is a cinematic miracle. And the two stories finally converge in a stroke of genius, making Matt realize that nothing is hazardous or gratuitous in life, and each decision carries severe consequences, and maybe his wife's tragedy is a lesson for the future. Still, the film doesn't try to teach us something; it never addresses its audience with the patronizing tone. As I said, it finds the perfect tone between drama and comedy, enough to make us savor the ironies of life and how each inconvenience can contain a path to happiness and vice versa. George Clooney is the soul of this wonderful study on family and marital relationships, as man who realizes that if people can change to the worst by circumstances, a tragedy can change them for the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt King's (George Clooney) wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) had a boating accident and is in a coma. Now he has to find a way to deal with his daughters, who were closest to their mother; and then he learns Elizabeth was having an affair and would have divorced him. On top of all that, he has a big decision to make: to sell or keep 25,000 acres of prime Hawaiian real estate before the trust runs out; and most of the family wants him to sell. Matt King has a lot on his plate. George Clooney does a remarkable job as one in shock trying to keep everything together knowing he has mountains to climb to get next to his daughters plus just finding out that his wife was about to leave him before the accident. He has an amazing ability to convey his emotions via his facial expressions and we really don't need a lot of his dialogue to see this. We care for him and hope all turns out well. An unexpected alliance with eldest daughter Alex (Shailena Woodley) has a somewhat stabilizing effect. This is a good story and the acting by all is exceptional. Yes, there is a lot of language in the beginning mostly by the older daughter Alex, who has issues with Matt and also with her mother who is still in a coma. Children using foul language seems to be a common trend now in Hollywood movies, and I guess that tells children and adults who see this movie it's okay now to spout off in this way. Hollywood has taken to heart the ploy of the Camel's head in the tent. Pretty soon it will be open season for children to use foul language so get ready to see the entire Camel inside that tent. We see many beautiful shots of the landscapes in Hawaii, and we wished there could have been more. However, since the setting is Hawaii, we did expect to see some shots of surfers in heavy surf and some hula dancers. Didn't happen although there was that opportunity. Some quick shots is all we asked for. Was that too much to ask ? Apparently so. The accompanying Hawaiian music was good and appropriate at times. There were some attempts at comic relief in here with Nick Krause as Sid, Alex's boyfriend. When he wasn't annoying, he was pretty good. George Clooney was nominated for Best Actor. Didn't get it. The movie was nominated for Best Picture, Best Editing, and Best Director. Didn't happen. It did win an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay and that made sense.There should be an Oscar for Best Facial Expressions as sometimes the whole story can be seen right there. And, if there were such an Oscar, George Clooney would win hands down. (7/10)Violence: Not really, but Sid (Krause) is popped in the face. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, and by children, too, with the F-bombs</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for everyone, but I liked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just rented this yesterday b/c there was nothing on TV. I watched it during the day and liked it. Then I watched it with my husband after the kids were in bed and he wasn't all that thrilled. His exact words were "there wasn't anything better on?" It's slow and it's a drama (definitely NOT a comedy which the TV said it was...). And that's not for everyone. I loved all the great shots of Hawaii and I felt like the acting was pretty good (even from "Scottie" who hasn't been in anything else...although she looks REALLY familiar). Anyway, the story was good and I liked how the two storyline came together. I really only laughed 2 or 3 times and they were just little 1) when the mom of the other girl says "I forgot about the time Scottie told my daughter she didn't want to be her partner on the rock wall b/c she didn't want to fall into her butt-crack. That doesn't even make sense." IDK why but that was just really funny to me. 2) When Sid get's punched in the face. And a 3rd time I can't remember...Otherwise it was actually pretty sad. You end up really hating the mom b/c she was a whore and the kids are so completely out of line it drove us nuts, but still. I can't imagine how my kids would react to something like that and it really makes you think about how one little accident can change your whole life (and everyone around you). I wasn't truly fond of the little girl and all the profanity/sexual stuff. I am definitely no prude (I love me some Judd Appatow so that should tell you something lol) but she was only 10 and they were using the f word every other word around her and talking about porn and boobs etc. IDK it just made me cringe a little bit. Even my husband who swears constantly said "the writers really liked the f bomb huh?". **POSSIBLE SPOILER**The only thing I would change would be the very last scene. I really wish it had been the 3 of them camping on the land b/c earlier Scottie said she wanted to go camping out there and never got to go.</fullReview>

It is one of those movies for which the trailer is far better than the movie.Spend 2 hours in your life doing something that's really good but don't waste it with this movie.All the fuss - Golden Globe, Academy Awards - influenced me that there could be something beyond the trailer, something hidden, something subtle and valuable; unfortunately this is all bad marketing for a bad product.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I'm ready to be a real husband and father, just wake up. Please Liz, just wake up." Mike King (Clooney) is having a rough time. He is the trustee for his families land in Hawaii and is about to finalize the sale of it. He has two daughters he is trying to raise with their mother and his wife in a coma. At the time he gets the news that his wife is for all accounts dead he finds out that she was also cheating on him. There are some movies that are so good that after you watch there really are no words to describe it. This is one of those movies. Anything I say may cheapen the way this movie makes you feel. I can say that Clooney did an amazing job in this movie. He plays a guy that is down on his luck and a type of "everyman"...and he makes it believable. For someone like Clooney to pull that off is amazing. Also the girl that plays his older daughter is absolutely wonderful and almost steals the movie. This is again a movie that needs to be watched but there are not enough words to describe why. Overall, one of the best movies of the year and I have to say "The Artist" must be amazing in order to beat this for best picture. I give it an A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply a good movie about a not so ordinary family.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has the feel of a good novel; not surprising since it's based on Kaui Hart Hemmings' novel. By all accounts, she wrote what she is familiar with and that always gives one an edge. I'm not surprised the movie made the Oscars' contender list; it was in the same class as most of the others. I loved the story; the characters are interesting and unless you don't like George Clooney to start with or character development pieces, you're bound to like this movie.The setting, Hawaii, goes a long way in eye pleasing scenery and this movie took advantage of it, but without overdoing it. I'll always remember my visit of the island of Oahu and the superb weather, so this movie brought back good memories. Now the characters in the movie are not outrageous and are very believable, thanks to the performances of the key actors. I did not know, before watching the movie, that Beau Bridges and Robert Foster would be among the supporting cast, so I was very pleased with that; they did more than bring their names to the table, they did a splendid job with their parts. Clooney was rightfully proud of his work. Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller in the roles of Clooney's daughters were terrific, which is my way of saying they were convincing.The story has two interesting aspect to it; one is how an amazingly grounded land baron (Matt King) and his daughters deal with the news that his dying wife, their mother, was cheating on him, which was well handled story and the other is the family's roots to the native founder of the former kingdom and how Matt King handles the potential biggest land deal of the state. The title, referring to that second aspect of the movie, was quite fitting. I certainly don't consider the movie a comedy just because, as in life, there are some funny scenes; since it's not a tragedy as we commonly think of such movies, plays or novels, I'll settle for simply a good story, and hope you find it to be that as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good film with a terrific script and beautifully acted, sensitively directed by Alexander Payne. It's a gently paced film but says a lot as it goes. Clooney's heart is in the right place and he's picked the right sort of vehicle for beliefs (I assume so anyway). It's not a comedy but has some very funny moments. The music isn't the usual heart-tugging stuff, it's just lovely Hawaiian folk singing. It would also have been helped by not having someone in the row behind me conducting a running commentary for morons but that's another story. Why is that some people can't go to the pictures without talking to each other about it all the way through? Don't dismiss The Descendants as a sentimental 'chick flick' - it isn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughtful entertaining movie about family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants is a movie about family and how our relationship with family members profoundly affects our lives.George Clooney plays Matt King. He is a lawyer from Hawaii whose wife is in a coma following a boating accident. He now has to deal with his two daughters, aged 10 and 17. This task had previously been left mainly to his wife.The movie is a series of scenes showing King dealing with this situation. He is a low-key kind of person and he is struggling to cope. It becomes even more complicated when he finds out that his wife was having an affair for a while before her accident and that she will not regain consciousness. There is also a subplot as Matt is in charge of a family trust about to make a multi-million dollar decision about the sale of prime local real estate.Some scenes are really effective, such as when King rants at his wife about her affair, as she lies comatose in the bed. There are some great scenes with his father-in-law, played by Robert Forster, who worshiped the ground his daughter walked on and blames Matt for the situation she is in.Matt's eldest daughter, brilliantly played by Shailene Woodley, tries to help her father as best she can after he decides to find out about the man his wife was having an affair with.For the most part, Clooney plays the part in a low-key way. There are a couple of his scenes that are played mostly for comic effect (for trailer purposes perhaps) but in general he does well in the part of the decent guy, trying to make the best of the situation he finds himself in.Director Alexander Payne does another good job in familiar territory, again examining the foibles of white middle class Americans, as he did in About Schmidt and Sideways. I enjoyed those movies also, though maybe he should try to look at different parts of society in future projects.</fullReview>

There's no doubt that this definitely isn't an up-beat movie and if you like your movies sugar coated this is probably one to avoid.The story follows a father Matt King (Clooney) coming to terms with his wife being in a coma. This means that he has to take care of his two daughters who are both dysfunctional even before their mother suffers the accident.I didn't really have any empathy with any of the characters and consequently found the movie a bit of a struggle. The best part of the movie is the lovely shots of Hawaii that feature prominently throughout. I wonder if the tourist board did some sort of deal to allow filming?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hawai'i ruling class</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am NOT among the people who think George Clooney was cheated at the Oscars for not winning the "Best Actor" award. In fact, I don't even think George Clooney is that good an actor in general nor do I like the topics of most of his movies. But I deal feel "The Descendants" is a worthwhile movie, including possible the "Best Picture" award because it does a good job of examining Hawaii's ruling colonist class without being too heavy handed about it.On the U.S. mainland, we almost never talk about the mixing of peoples nor do we seem to form stable mixed-race groups. Barack Obama, e.g., is "black" because in the U.S., if one of your parents is white and the other black, you are black to most white people, thus, if you want to have a life, you make that life in the black community where you are most likely to be accepted?and your whiteness is even an advantage. But on in most other parts of the world, the white colonists mixed with the non-whites to form mestizo (Native American + European) groups or mulatto (African + European) groups, and then when the whites left, the mestizos or the mulattoes simple took the place of the whites and the non-whites remained at the bottom. Guatemala and Haiti, respectively, are prime examples.So I have happy to see Clooney's film explore that aspect of Hawaiian mestizo culture (even if I don't buy the ending regarding the 25,000 acres of unspoiled Kauai paradise). And I would still love to visit Hawai'i someday?and I promise?I won't stay and try to muck up your paradise.</fullReview>

Kind of like life.The production values in the Hawaii location are, of course, spectacular. Much has also been said about George Clooney's performance, and it deserves all the praise it has received.

		<shortDescription>Don't wait another eight years, Alexander</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer-producer-director Alexander Payne does not make many movies but, when he does, you know that you are set for a treat of sharp observation and wry humour. His previous film "Sideways" was eight years ago and both "Sideways" and "The Descendants" are so good that we can only hope that he does not wait another eight years before entertaining us again. This time his source material is a debut novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, a family saga set in her native Hawaii - all t-shirts, shorts and flip-flops.At the centre of the story is Matt King, a successful lawyer who has engaged too little of late with his wife and two daughters, only to find that he has to take on new responsibilities and discoveries when his wife has a serious accident putting her in a coma. George Clooney leaves his assured, action man image behind, to play the confused and vulnerable husband and father who is now - in his words - just trying to keep his head above water. There are many other fine performances, but newcomer Shailene Woodley - whose previous work has been on television - is especially good as the older daughter Alexandra and could find that this proves to be her breakthrough role.There is much use of local music which I confess is not to my taste, but the geography of Hawaii itself is almost an additional character in this charming, moving and magical work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 4th in my 7 part Best Picture? Review Series (because let's face it, I'm not going to watch Incredibly 9/11 or War Horsey) we look at Alexander Payne's latest Big Thing?.Note: this summary is all in the trailer. No spoilers from The Fat Man today. So?George Clooney plays Matt King, a wealthy land owner, lawyer, and the least Hawaiian looking member of his purely Hawaiian family? guess we can chalk that up to his mother. His wife has been in a terrible accident and cheated on him (perhaps in that order, based on the trailer), so Matt must gather up his unruly daughters and go on a wacky adventure looking for HIM and just trying to keep the family dynamic alive. It sounds a lot like Sideways, but with a change of scenery.As a showcase of Hawaii, it was beautiful. The shots at sunset, the views over the green-crusted mountains, the ridiculously blue ocean ? it's more of Hawaii than I've ever seen in my life. I'd love to run off in to the hills and on the the perfectly white beaches. Beyond all the pretty was a story that made me feel less than inspired. I'm having trouble with the idea of medical-oriented story lines. It's a familiar story we all know to some extent. We've been there watching someone die or wondering if they'll get better. Hospitals can be a terrible, scary place and we write what we know. Earlier this year, 50/50 played the friend/cancer card and managed to rip a few tears from me. However in this case, it felt like a weird crutch for every emotional scene. Everyone was fine.. except when they talked explicitly about Matt's wife. Every other moment was wacky, oblivious of the tragedy at hand. Since we write what we know, I know that when someone you care about is ill or dying, everything reminds you of them. Songs, colors, just driving to work can make you break down crying. It's hard. You don't just shrug it off.I feel as though I've gotten a little abstract. Let me simplify and say write what you know, but be aware it can come of as a little cheap and forced. It takes some real talent to write familiar themes in to unfamiliar stories or to take familiar situations and approach them from a unique angle. The Descendants just didn't feel like it did either of those ? familiar situations, familiar reactions. I still stand by my view George Clooney is just George Clooney in every film. In the Ocean's movies, Clooney is Clooney stealing things. In Burn After Reading, Clooney is Clooney building something odd in his basement, in The Perfect Storm, Clooney is Clooney yelling at a storm. I've just never seen any depth in characters from him. He's really good at being Clooney, but if you want something else? well?don't hire Nick Cage either.I know I've been pretty critical, but this is a Best Picture nominee. It was an enjoyable movie, nice to look at, had a few laughs, but nothing like Sideways or any of the other nominees. I'm not sure why it's even up there, to be honest.</fullReview>

Clooney manages to pick scripts that are not always 'regular Hollywood fare'. Remember 'Men That Stare At Goats'? He is blessed with great voice. Like Mel Gibson, Russell Crowe and Paul Newman, Clooney is the full package. He can act, write, produce, direct and move between each of these scenarios with ease, or combine when he feels it necessary. THE DECENDENTS is a great film. The plot with Clooneys wife on life support and his journey from that point on, had me in from the first frame. Go see this film. Its one of those feel good movies that tends to leave you thinking about for sometime after. Eight stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine comedy-drama about re-discovery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hawaiian-based lawyer Matt King (George Clooney) is on the verge of brokering the sale of 25,000 acres of land which will make him and his extended family millionaires, when his wife is placed into a coma following a boating accident. Learning that she will never wake up, and that because of her will, the doctors will soon turn off the life support, Matt tries to re-connect with his two daughters, 17 year old Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) and 10 year old Scottie (Amara Miller). Scottie is in trouble at school for making inappropriate art and picking on fellow students, and Alexandra has problems with drinking. Matt also learns from Alexandra that his wife was having an affair with an estate agent named Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard), so they all travel to Kaua'i to confront him.Director Alexander Payne's previous films have all focused on deeply flawed yet entirely real human beings, and The Descendants is no exception. His 2004 masterpiece Sideways, one of the finest comedy- dramas of its decade, focused on a depressive, bitter writer and his adulterous friend on their stag holiday. These were quite despicable characters, yet thanks to a smart script, brilliant performances, and some genuine humanity, you became invested in them almost instantly. Clooney's Matt is hardly as unlikeable as that, but he is a man who has all but neglected his family for years, and one that holds the cards to a land sale that could see one of the state's most beautiful and natural location turned into a tourist hotspot.This is ultimately a story of re-discovery. Matt comes from a line of mixed white and Hawaiian descendants, and is constantly locked in a battle with himself over the sale of the land. He and his cousins plan to sell to a Hawaiian native, but the land is a vast area of beauty that he used to enjoy with his wife and children, and so by selling it, he will be ultimately selling himself out. Hawaii is key to the plot. Usually portrayed as a place of beauty and serenity, Payne breaks this trend in the first few scenes where he shows us the homeless shacked up on the beach, and the urban areas blowing with dirt and litter. It is also volcanic, and Payne shoots it with as many blues and greys as there are oranges and yellows. It is thought of as paradise, but as Matt tells us in the opening narration, "paradise can go f**k itself."Clooney gives possibly the best performance of his career here. He has no beard to alter his appearance like his Oscar-winning turn in Syriana (2005), here he is laid bare, and gives his most emotionally naked performance. He has truly come a long way since Batman &amp; Robin (1997) almost single-handedly destroyed his career before it started, and I wouldn't be surprised if his name is called for Best Actor in the upcoming Academy Awards. Woodley is also impressive, quickly evolving from a generic bratty teenager into a mature confidant to her father.The Descendants has been advertised and portrayed as a comedy-drama, and although their is some fine comic moments in the film, usually stemming from Nick Krause's surfer-dude Sid's inappropriate comments, the film is ultimately an emotional drama. This led to frustrated shufflings in the cinema by people expecting either a generic rom-com or a full-blown comedy, and caused one very annoying fat idiot behind me repeatedly yawning. It is about 15 minutes too long, and lingers too much on the rather predictable and un-involving sub-plot about the land sale, but The Descendants is powerfully written and often very moving, and is a fine example of how Alexander Payne is the finest storyteller of real human beings working today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the film. I am a Clooney fan, I think he is a terrific actor and in this role he comes through tops. I am also impressed with the cast, all of it but especially the two daughters and the boyfriend. Their characters develop against the tragedy and become stronger as the film progresses. I liked especially the change in Clooney's attitude towards Sid once he realises that his initial assessment was superficial and wrong because it is something that happens so often in real life between parents and boy or girlfriend of their adolescent children.The film could have done with less insistence on the Hawaiian scenery, beautiful as it is - at times too much travelogue but that's just my feeling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was not just an amazing movie to watch, it actually is a depiction of our human life as such. The visuals of the movie are breath-taking. I just felt that, i should settle in Hawaii after watching this movie. For a moment, i couldn't find a reason why this movie should be rated less than a perfect ten.The story starts with Matt King juggling a personal trauma of about to lose his wife in a couple of weeks alongside trying to settle a family fortune of inheriting an island in Hawaii with his cousins. Also, Matt needs to pay attention to his two estranged daughters, whom he hasn't met for months due to his indulgence with work. Just when he tries to be a good husband, he realizes that his wife has been cheating with him.Now, will he be able to bring his family together and become the father of his kids and fill in the shoes of their mother, will he able to forgive his wife and above all, will he able to realize his real fortune in life?. To know more, Watch it with your family, for sure.It is a simple story told in a very heart-warming way. Hats off to Alexander Payne. George Clooney deserves all the accolades for his stupendous performance. It is to be seen, whether he takes home the Oscar for Best Actor or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The kids are not all right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't going to see this in case, like THE ARTIST, it turned out to have been over-hyped by all the Oscar and Bafta 'buzz'. No worries: THE DESCENDANTS is a little gem of an Unhappy Families movie that reminded me of 2010's THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT. And George Clooney's performance really does deserve all the nominations it has pulled in. An actor who often trades on his glamour to give pleasing but lightweight performances in the style of Cary Grant, George here achieves a resonating depth reminiscent of Jack Nicholson at his best. Matt, a man whose world has just fallen apart, has to deal with anger as well as grief; he forces himself to hold things together for the sake of his daughters.All the adults in the movie give fine but underplayed performances that allow the kids - the two girls and the know-it-all friend who tags along - to shine. These two potty-mouthed girls are losing their mother. There is some laughter along the way but the grief, when it comes, is raw and real - not the 'engineered' mawkishness at the end of WARHORSE.A score of lilting Hawaiian love-songs provides an ironical counterpoint to the tragedy, and the lush tropical beauty of the islands underscores the movie's central theme: even in Paradise people are forced to live lives of quiet desperation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The man behind the brilliant Election and Sideways returns to the director's chair for The Descendants, an often amusing, touching comedy-drama about a lawyer in Hawaii who only discovers his wife was unfaithful after she goes into a coma. It's Payne's best movie since Election and the best film of 2011 that I've seen so far.I'm from a family that was broken up by adultery, and parts of this movie hit home. The added twist is that the wife is in a coma and is dying, making a divorce totally unnecessary. Clooney plays the lawyer, and he and his teenage daughter have to cope with saying goodbye to someone they loved, yet who they are justifiably angry with. As well, Clooney has a 10-year-old girl who is thrown into his hands, and he has no idea how to take care of her.Clooney handles his role well, in spite of what I've heard about his inability to do crying scenes. The girls are honestly and sympathetically depicted, and the setting of Hawaii helps give the film some colour as well as pleasing scenery. The emotion in the film varies by scene and character; ultimately it might be characterized as bittersweet. Like Little Miss Sunshine and The Royal Tenenbaums before it, The Descendants is another movie that succeeds in capturing a family warts and all, while at the same time managing a few chuckles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant, heartbreaking "Coming of age" story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen such an marvelous film ever since the DVD release of "Trust", and before I ever got to watch this flick, I didn't exactly know what to expect, since I hadn't previously seen any movies directed by Alexander Payne, but when I did sit down and watched it, I honestly didn't regret it.The Descendants is based on the book of the same name by Kaui Hart Hemmings, retelling the story of Matt King (George Clooney. E.R, Up in the Air), a lawyer and sole trustee of a family trust, who is struggles to cope with his wife's boating accident that has led her to comatose, when at the same time, he tries to rebuild his bond with his daughters, the troubled, rebellious 17 year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley. The Secret Life on the American Teenager, and the spunky, but confused 10 year-old Scottie (newcomer Amara Miller).While quite interesting to watch, The Descendants isn't a movie for everyone. Being emotionally prepared to view this heartbreaking and touching drama that captures perfectly the exact emotions of loss, betrayal and pain, learning to re-connect with the other one, supporting each other with love.Clooney's Matt King may be his most remarkable, outstanding performance, as this is not the kind of role that most are used of seeing him in, being an extremely mature role for him, very far away from the playboys, the rich business men and such. In the film, his performance is not only realistic, but remarkable, capturing the exact feelings of King's coping. This is probably one of his strongest roles, alongside with his work in "Up in the Air".On the other hand, Woodley's performance catches the eyes of viewers, along with almost completely stealing the movie away from her co-star Clooney. It is actually quite surprising and shocking that her role as Alex is her first film work, and probably will be one of her strongest in her career, even though she is mostly known from her experience in TV shows, such as The Secret Life of the American Teenager and The O.C. She still gets more than one scene show the many sides of Alex, proving she has the exact amount of charm and dread to make her character beyond believable and beautiful. She may be so much younger than Clooney, but their chemistry is truly amazing.Probably being one of the best movies premiered in 2011, The Descendants does not only show a heartbreaking, incredibly realistic story, but amazingly outstanding performances from all the cast and an excellent direction by Payne. If there is something I'm certainly sure of, is that the flick perfectly deserves the well earned wind and nominations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Okay, Nothing New or Special Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie without a clue what it was about. I didn't even know it was in Hawaii. But I'd seen the ratings so I thought I'd give it a watch. Unfortunately I was really unimpressed. The Descendants has a relatively interesting plot, but I felt like everything played out poorly. Nothing felt particularly significant, even though it was a pretty small-scale movie it terms of what happened. It never felt truly important to anyone. Maybe it was just the actors, or maybe it was just the writing. I don't know. Either way, it didn't feel like anyone really gave a crap what happened. The characters were okay, just average in terms of today's standards. I assume that they were trying to develop the characters more, considering the fact that it's a movie about family, but I just didn't see any particular amount of effort put into them. The acting really wasn't that good either. I wouldn't say it was bad, but it wasn't good either, especially George Clooney. I really didn't see anything special about his acting, and it ended up feeling a little fake. There was so little emotion in his face that it really took away from the feel of it. He really seemed like he just didn't care and wasn't genuine. I haven't seen many Clooney movies, but if he's always like this then I really don't have a heck of a lot to look forward to with him. I even thought that Amara Miller did better than he did.Overall the Descendants had an interesting but poorly carried out plot. The characters were pretty average, and the acting was bland and often ingenuine. In the end I would not recommend The Descendants because even though it wasn't a bad movie, it just wasn't anything special at all.</fullReview>

The heart of the story is constantly beating with the images, the score, the shots and the acting. George had his hand on the pulse of his character. It felt like a documentary as we shared in his journey in these difficult times that allowed us to peak into his life. As an audience we want to see glimpses of humanity and I saw it in each actor and in the over all feeling of the movie. Definitely one I will forever have in my memory banks.

Clearly I'm in the minority on this one, with the endless accolades, critical acclaim and box office success this film has enjoyed. But nothing rang true for me and part of the problem is that I could care less about a single character. I didn't find this privileged family compelling and the structure felt episodic and designed to give each character their Oscar consideration scene. This felt like a minor work from a great talent, who made a large misstep and unconvincingly tried to blend comedy and sentiment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies you almost feel guilty for not liking, especially the music. The scenery was beautiful, but then of course, we're talking about Hawaii. The soundtrack is presumably influenced by indigenous musical styles and in my fairly eclectic musical tastes I should have found a spot for it, but I would not volunteer to listen to it again, with or without the movie. The plot seemed to take a really long time to get any where (of course, they're not on mainland time, right?), then wrapped up all of a sudden as if they'd run out of film. The acting seemed flat, despite having liked most of the better known actors in other roles. I've seen other movies where I didn't really find a likable character (e.g. Rachel Getting Married) but ended up liking the film anyway -- not this one. I just couldn't warm up to this one at all.I've never been to Hawaii (yet!) and don't hang out with many 8-figure income folks, so maybe that's why I couldn't relate. Maybe next life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm only giving this movie a 4 because it takes place in Hawaii, and there is some pretty scenery to view. But that is all this movie has going for it. I don't get why Clooney was nominated for acting awards for this, it's not a great role. He plays Matt King, a native Hawaiian whose family owned lots of land and he and the relatives have sold it over the years to make millions. Matt saved a lot of his money and gets by on what he makes as a lawyer while other family members have wasted it. The family is about to sell their last parcel of land, but Matt has other worries, like the fact his wife was in a boating accident and is brain dead. He finds out she was having an affair from his daughter, Alex. His two kids, Alex and Scottie, are disrespectful and act like it's no big deal their mom is going to die. They think nothing of cursing out their dad and he doesn't know how to discipline them.Matt decides to track down, Brian, the man having the affair to tell him he should say his good-byes to his wife. So Matt and his daughters plus Alex's weird friend, Sid, go to Kuaii and find Brian and his family.The movie is basically one long pity party set around a death bed.FINAL VERDICT: I don't get why it got good critical reviews. I think most will find it boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If they gave out Oscars for mediocrity?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Academy Awards was the brainchild of MGM producer Louis B Mayer, and began as an attempt to reward filmic excellence at a time when filmmakers and film actors had little credibility. A far cry from the glitzy, orchestrated performance that it is today, the very first Oscars ceremony in 1929 was a low-key, private function in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Guest tickets were a mere five dollars, only 15 awards were handed out and, having announced the winners three months previously, many of the nominees didn't even bother to show up.Today, the Oscars is the biggest night in the Hollywood calendar, and winning one of the famed statuettes is as much a confirmation of one's status in the business as it is a mark of artistic merit. While each year the nominations for the 24 categories recognise some truly worthy films and filmmakers, the top awards remain a kind of elite club that honours the staying power of the lucky winner rather than the quality of their work that year.After making critically acclaimed, box-office smashes for three decades, Martin Scorsese earned his first award for Best Director in 2006 with The Departed, which was far from his finest hour. On the other end of the scale there is Sandra Bullock, who outraged the film world in 2009 when she was named Best Actress for her astoundingly half-decent performance in The Blind Side. As such, the highest honours have become little more than a pat on the back for managing to stay in the limelight for a decent amount of time.When the nominations for the eighty-fourth awards ceremony were announced at the end of January, Alexander Payne's The Descendants was one of two films that hit the hallowed trifecta, gaining nominations for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, for George Clooney's lead performance. The film sees Payne at nowhere near the height of his capabilities and Clooney in typically semi-competent form yet, if the pattern bears, it should be a formidable contender at the Oscars this year.Following the tried and true formula Payne perfected with About Schmidt (2002) and Sideways (2004), The Descendants centres on an emotionally powerless man muddling his way through a tragicomic series of events. Matt King (George Clooney) is a Hawaiian, workaholic lawyer who has little time for his dysfunctional family. This all changes when his wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie), falls into a coma after a speedboat accident. Soon the doctor's tell him that Elizabeth won't recover and, following the stipulations of her living will, they must remove her from life-support.Matt is left to sort out his wife's last wishes, reconnect with his daughters, and negotiate the high-profile sale of hundreds of acres of untouched Hawaiian land that has been in his family for generations. The plot thickens when his wayward eldest, Alexandra (Shailene Woodley), returns from boarding school and tells him that, in the months before the accident, his wife was having an affair. The rest of the film follows Matt in his attempts to come to terms with all that has happened and regain a sense of what is important in his life.The Descendants is based on a novel of the same name by Hawaiian author Kaui Hart Hemmings and is adapted by Payne and his co-writers with care and warmth. His direction is light but expressive, and the gorgeous landscapes of Hawaii serve as a perfect foil for the bittersweet turns of the narrative. Nevertheless, the film bears a certain schmaltzy gloss that compromises this delicate balance.What made Payne's previous work so hard-hitting was that despite being extremely cynical and closed off, his protagonists were human and their struggles had, for all their dark humour, a pang of reality. Matt King is presented to us as a kind of young Warren Schmidt yet, despite his curmudgeonly narration insisting he's damaged goods, he regains his zest for life pretty easily. Where Payne usually offers only a glimmer of hope for his wayward anti-heroes, we see Matt King take everything in his stride and come out a better, more rounded individual for it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, except that Matt's journey from emotionally detached malcontent to bleeding-heart family man is incredibly unconvincing.While there are several moving scenes, the film is nevertheless marred by its painfully generic script. Clooney's opening narration, in which he refutes the claim that all Hawaiians live in paradise, with the less than elegantly put 'Paradise can go f*** itself', offers about as much emotional insight as the diary entry of a dejected teenager. Similarly, as Matt starts to soften, his Hallmark-card platitudes about love and forgiveness, feel incredibly cheap for a screenwriter of Payne's skill.Many critics have deemed this Clooney's greatest performance to date. While this may well be true, this isn't really saying much. He plays the inexpressive, closed-off patriarch rather well, but this seems down to his ineptitude more than anything else.As it draws to a close, The Descendants regains some semblance of the understated poignancy for which Payne is known, but on the whole it remains an underwhelming story about reconciliation and doing the right thing by our loved ones. It dilutes Payne's classic themes into a far more contrived format and gives Clooney a decent role in which to flaunt his average abilities. In short, it is Oscar-worthy through and through. Payne and Clooney have certainly stuck around long enough to deserve recognition and this sweet but pedestrian film is the perfect vehicle to earn them a couple of those gaudy statuettes.</fullReview>

Remake the same film in a city and it is nothing you would ever consider seeing. No dynamic plot and Clooney could not reflect the deepest emotions a man in his position would feel. After a point where the biggest clue in the story is given to us everything new stops and we follow a very predicted film. On the other hand young actors have some very promising performances that are finally lost due to the dominant scenery. I would prefer a depth in all the characters rather than an easy way to make a mediocre film impressing by putting it in Hawai. Don't see it , does not worth your money and time.

My first problem with it is the constant profanity used by the two young daughters; it's-putting, to say the least. Second, the story is a real downer, dealing with death, infidelity, and family struggles. Third, it's relentlessly tedious, so monotonously depressing that it gets old fast.The Hawaiian scenery is beautiful and it represents unvarnished reality, but it's just not my idea of entertainment.</fullReview>

The film just isn't deep enough. It looks as if things and people were there just for the sake of being there. Scenes are being shown because, err, it's a movie? I wouldn't say it was a bad idea to make this film; just the realisation could and should have been much better. Of course Hawaii is nice but I didn't watch the movie to see Hawaii. Anyway, good few scenes were shot when it was overcast and I'm not quite sure that was the intention. The land selling part of the story was just too obvious from the beginning. Well, how was he going to decide? As for George Clooney, I saw him only as George Clooney. Maybe it's not his fault, maybe the script didn't give him the opportunity to "shine". Anyway, this film clearly misses something that could have made it into a very good film. I'm sure it was meant to be emotional but the emotions were not there. All in all, if you are thinking between watching this film and doing something else, at many times the latter option will be better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE DESCENDANTS - 8 out of 10 I sometimes think that considering the obvious talent George Clooney has , he does not test himself enough with some of he roles he picks . He is certainly one of the most gifted and natural actors around and the ease in which he makes acting look is frightening . . Thankfully the role of Matt King in The Descendants is a much bigger test of his ability and it's no surprise that the Cloonmiester comes out of it with flying colours.Matt King is a father of two girls and a husband to a wife who is in a Coma after a boating accident. While she he is trying to be a father to his girls for the first time in his life , he finds out that his wife was up things he new nothing about.What i like about this film is it's slow pace . Despite the tragic circumstantial of what's on show , it has a lovely tranquil feel about it. It helps that it's set in Hawaii and that it has a fantastic soundtrack of Hawaiin music but it's also down to a great script.At times it has a Coen brothers feel about it . It may be because Clooney is in the lead or it may be that the humour is the same.The acting is great by all the cast and i especially like Nick Krause who played Sid. Although it'snot the best film I've seen recently it certainly deserves it's Oscar nominations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wishy-washy storyline, but entertaining enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants (Dir. Alexander Payne, 2012) has received a lot of Oscar nominations, much like The Artist (Dir. Michel Hazanavicius, 2011). The most notable of these nominations is George Clooney for Best Actor, which is an undoubtedly a tough category this year. After watching The Descendants I have to say I am surprised at the success it has received, in awards and box office earnings.The acting in this film is fantastic and deserves recognition. The eldest daughter, Alexandra (Shailene Woodley), was one of the best actors in this film, providing a strong and capable female lead, unlike Amara Miller, who plays the younger daughter, Scottie. Both Scottie and Alexandra's best friend Sid (Nick Krause) are obnoxious characters who are seemingly only there for comical effect, and therefore they are not developed to the extent of Alexandra or Matt King (George Clooney) and unneeded in the plot. It has to be said that I have seen Clooney provide better performances than in The Descendants, like in O Brother, Where Art Thou? (Dir. Joel &amp; Ethan Cohen, 2000).The story, from the very beginning, feels like a classic Clooney film, which by the end is sure to have had equilibrium restored. The underlying dilemma throughout The Descendants is how Matt King and his children will deal with his wives death. The majority of the plot, however, strongly focuses on the sale of a large portion of land on a remote island in Hawaii, which perhaps is meant to symbolise the family's troubles with losing their mother/child/wife. Hawaii is also a good setting due to its multiple islands, which might signify the separated King family at the beginning of the film.The soundtrack is also worth a quick mention, as it again feels like Clooney's soundtrack. The slow playing ukulele, I presume, which then picks up during any "action" scenes. This soundtrack feels very similar to that of Fantastic Mr. Fox (Dir. Wes Anderson, 2009), which featured the vocal talents of George Clooney. An upbeat, and Caribbean score like this does help draw you into the world of the Kings. I cannot personally say this film is worthy of any Oscars, due to its very wishy-washy narrative. In-depth analysis does perhaps make the choice of location, characters and plot a more complex and intelligent decision, but that alone cannot make a film great. I have heard that this film is made better with multiple viewings, but whether I will buy it on DVD, when released, is unclear.

		<shortDescription>Lacks the spark, cannot capture the interest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt King (George Clooney) is the chairman of the family trust which owns massive piece of land on Hawaii. After his wife suffers from the boat accident, he tries to overcome the pain and re-connect with his two daughters.As somebody correctly put it, this movie is the living evidence of how flawed the new concept of the Oscars is. Previously, each category had only 5 nominees, strictly, whereas now they include "between 5 and 10". This resulted in movies being nominated, which are clearly not up to speed with the rest of the nominees, and that only highlights their mediocrity. And yes, the Descendants is one of those movies.The Descendants is Alexander Payne's latest film since Sideways, based upon the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, and it already snatched a few awards, including Best Picture (Drama) at this year's Golden Globes, along with George Clooney being awarded the Best Actor (Drama) award. And it is nominated for the Oscars along with Hugo, Artist and Moneyball. And the question "Why was it awarded?" still stays in my head.The distinctive feature of the movie is that it tries to depict life as it is, so that the viewer should be more engaged with what is going on the screen, will associate him/herself easier with the main characters, and laugh at the simple everyday moments captured by the camera. I have to admit ? they succeeded. I, personally, was associating myself with one of the main characters, but not with King or the older daughter's boyfriend, Sid. The whole movie I felt like the dying Elizabeth King, not able to move or regain consciousness, but forced to die slowly and painfully. The movie is annoying in the boredom it manages to inflict. It has clear start but no culmination or catharsis, or indeed anything to keep you alive. 115 minutes of the show felt like 515, endless show of people desperate to present us with drama and emotions, but failing at igniting the passion for the characters.I won't say the movie is bad. It has all the right components, very nice storyline, great performance by Clooney and Shailene Woodley as Alexandra King, fantastic director's work. But there is a very important component missing, something that helps to distinguish between just good and excellent movies; some kind of spark, something that makes you willing to watch it to the end because you are genuinely interested in what is going on. Without this, pretty good components mix together to form a very mediocre movie.And of course there were high expectations. I expect a very high level from all the Oscar nominees, and this film clearly does not live up to expectations. It is well below the benchmark set up by the main nominees of this year, and even some movies that were not nominated are better. And this high expectations problem is the final piece that turns just mediocre movie into something intolerably mediocre.I have to say a couple of words about the soundtrack. When I was faced with the boredom, I intuitively started to look for something entertaining, and I thought I found it: the soundtrack to the movie is light Hawaiian music. The problem is: you will listen to exactly the same song for the whole duration of the movie. 115 minutes of exactly the same song. By the end of the film I started to hate it.VERDICT: Mediocre movie, definitely well below the level of other Oscar nominees. WATCH: If you are Clooney or Payne fan. Or if you love the Hawaiian music.m-picturegoer.blogspot.com</fullReview>

But he gets another...Payne once again tells the tale of a man of a certain advanced age reaching a crossroads in his life. He tells these tales well, but the fact is Payne's weakest outing so far has received, ironically, the most attention. Who said the star system was dead? Clooney's presence has somehow wangled Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Picture. Certainly, in the latter category, this is an indicator of how lite the field is this year. The Descendants is a good film, but not a great one. Payne famously knocked Clooney back for the failed actor role in Sideways - an astute decision - and while he gets to stretch his acting legs somewhat here, it is more Clooney being Clooney than putting in a performance.The film gets off to a bad start with a on-the-nose narration that would barely scrape a passing grade at Screen writing school. Who people are, why they dress the way they do, what challenges our hero Matt King is now faced with and how he feels about them are relayed matter-of-factly as if the medium were a radio play. The pace meanders as Matt attempts to fix the disconnect with his daughters, especially troubled teen Alexandra (Shailene Woodley in the movie's stand-out performance). Things are not helped when she brings along her boyfriend, an oaf so clumsily scribbled into the script for comic relief that a script reader or producer somewhere should be fired for letting him get to screen.Some funny moments, some touching ones, but on a sentimental, melodramatic level rather than a cathartic one. About Schmidt and Sideways stayed with me, but The Descendants will fade rapidly. To be honest, it already has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Descendants Descends Into Mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PT Barnum said it first, so like a dummy I got sucked into wasting a ten dollar bill on one of the most inferior Oscar-nominated pictures to come down the pike in some time. I thought it was supposed to be a movie for grown-ups that was above the norm for what passes for entertainment from Hollywood nowadays. No way.This was an uninteresting, tedious waste of nearly two hours, a movie about a dying woman who has a busy husband and two potty-mouth kids. The husband belongs to one of the founding families of Hawaii and is the executor of the land trust in question. Actually, the woman is on life support, which is more than can be said of the plot line of this potboiler. At least she is spared the agony of living through the movie like the rest of us.George Clooney is a handsome fellow who makes a favorable appearance in most of his pictures but is hamstrung here by a boring part in a boring story. the rest of the cast is forgettable except for Beau Bridges who plays one of Clooney's relatives, and Shailene Woodley who plays Clooney's older daughter.My rating is based on Clooney's appearance and some lovely scenes of Hawaii. It may win some Oscars but will probably sink without a trace once the in-crowd moves on to the next 'meaningful' film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again - third time in a row! - Alexander Payne manages to fool everyone into thinking he created a great piece of art. Just like Sideways and About Schmidt, The Descendants is a pretentious, pompous drama masquerading as a dramedy. Like Paul Giamatti and Jack Nicholson, respectively, in those two movies, George Clooney's Matt King is an unlikable, whiny character placed in unrelatable and far-fetched situation. Unlike those two, though, King has no redeeming features, and the movie has no sense of humor to help us along - Nick Krause is brought along for some attempt at comic relief which is mainly irritating and repulsive. King is an egotistical, privileged, self-centered, bad father, bad husband, rich bum, and Clooney indeed does a pretty good job playing him - for a supporting character. Unfortunately, Payne constantly drills into our heads that he's the protagonist and that for some reason we're supposed to root for him and, worse, feel sorry for him.There is nothing likable about Matt King, or about his bratty daughters, played by Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller, who obviously got their stubbornness and ungratefulness from their father. There is nothing the least bit relatable about his condition or his action, and I was never for a second convinced that I should sympathize with him rather than his dying wife, whose character is so flat and gets so little characterization that she may have been in a coma when she was alive, too, for all we know or care. Alexander Payne buys the critics and the award shows with fake emotion, bad people and hypocrisy. Usually I'd call a movie like Sideways, which gains a lot of hype despite mediocre quality, an overrated or over-hyped movie; The Descendants is a bad one. If it wins the Best Picture Oscar as it did the Golden Globe I'll lose what little respect I have for the American film industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great travelogue for Hawaii - but otherwise empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected so much from this film considering the Bafta and Oscar nominations but, oh dear, this is an over-long and ultimately unresolved hiatus which dishonestly played to the emotions involved of a wife in a coma and a husband coming to terms with being the surviving parent of two wayward children. It seemed to me that after the initial teenage sulkiness from the older child that she quickly (within 24 hours) turned into a pretty helpful and accommodating adult - which, in my experience, is far from the truth. Five to ten years I'd say is the norm. SPOILER ALERT: Once we knew that the wife's lover was involved with the land deal I think only the dimmest viewer would be surprised by the final choice that King made on the sale of the Hawaiin land.Pretty pictures of Hawaii. Not so keen on Hawaiin music though - and there's a lot of it. And the Hawaiin shirts might give you a headache if you haven't dozed off beforehand. A 100 minute film felt like twice the length and four times as empty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every year there is an incredibly overrated movie that gets nominated for best picture and other awards, this year its The Descendants. I have enjoyed Alexander Paynes previous movies very much, i loved Election and All About Schmidt. the first half of the film tries extremely hard to be subtly funny but misses every time, then it tries this realistic emotional story but you never actually believe any of the characters, the whole movie feels so artificial, the characters are so clichéd, its another indie dysfunctional family movie thats hardly enjoyable. I would never want to discourage someone from seeing a movie for themselves but I caution you if you haven't seen it try to go in with low expectations rather than expecting an Oscar worthy movie you might find some enjoyment in it... p.s.

		<shortDescription>Shattered Family Drama Ends With Glimpse Of Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants takes a dramatic look at the structure of family and the intrinsic bonds that holds its members together. This dark and wonderful drama painfully reveals the fact that many families are broken, often ugly things, yet still mysteriously hold together. It provides a solemn example of how every single piece of a family can be fragmented yet recreated through communal obstacles.Directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways), the film has been nominated for five Oscars, including "Best Motion Picture of the Year" and "Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role" going to George Clooney.While delightful slivers of dry humor pop up now and again, the film is surprisingly dreary for having gorgeous Hawaii as a backdrop. When Matt King's (Clooney) wife suffers a tragic boating accident, he rallies his two wayward daughters together to cope with their bed- ridden mother. Tragedies with relatives and friends are always around the corner for the King family. It is difficult to not feel for Matt with the relentless beatings he takes as he keeps a dissonant family together.Spectacular performances by George Clooney and Shailene Woodly (Secret Life of the American Teenager) as Matt King's oldest rebel daughter hold the well-paced narrative together. The two make a great pair and bring their characters to life. The Descendants has an array of lovable supporting characters from a 'head-bopping' grandfather; to an early-developed middle-school girl; to a shaggy-haired tag-along teen struggling with his own family losses. These characters are quirky and play mostly comical roles in the film, but are nevertheless excellent and well-done additions. Hawaii is the perfect choice of location for a project like The Decendants. It offers lush jungles, pristine beaches, modern American cities and laid back residents; plus it allows Clooney to sport the typical Hawaiian floral-print shirt. There is something so fundamentally opposite about placing a broken, distrustful and crude family in such an unspoiled environment that it feels right and disturbingly raw. It seems as though more and more families around the world are being torn apart for a billion different reasons, leaving its members feeling abandoned or helpless. This film strikes at the heart of this problem, forcing the audience to grit their teeth through it all: the vulgarity spewing out of a 12 year old's mouth and the binge drinking habits of an unappreciated high school daughter. Thankfully, the film allows its viewers to leave the theater with a handful of hope for today's families instead of a downhearted silence. This film comes surprisingly close to one of those offbeat independent movies where the importance of a good story clearly ranks higher than profit-making strategies for the filmmakers. It is a breath of fresh Hawaiian air from much of the other junk being shown on the silver screens and truly worth an intentional watch if the threat of tears does not bother you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarmingly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The contrast between the beauty of the Hawaiian landscape with the traumatic events unfolding in the plot allow for a beautiful harmony between emotional depth and aesthetic appeal. It is refreshing to see Clooney play a man pushed outside his comfort zone, as opposed to the suave, confident character he so often pulls off in his earlier films such as Ocean's Eleven.However, whilst the relationships between characters introduced early in the film are uneasy at best, the reconciliation between Clooney's character Matt King and his daughter comes all too suddenly without full explanation, rendering it rather unconvincing. Shailene Woodley has to be commended on her performance, portraying, in my opinion the best character in the film, whom the audience immediately warms to, with the most compelling scene featuring her alone as she cries underwater.Amongst all the drama and emotional strain unfolding, Sid is always there to provide a little comic relief, the most memorable of which where he manages to gain some laughs from an Alzheimer patient. It would have been an all too depressing film in his absence. All in all, the film can reach out to a wide audience, and came as enjoyable viewing on a Sunday evening. I could not help feeling, however, like the family at the end of the film, slumped down expressionless on the sofa, as the film never reaches any emotional extremes. A heartwarmingly entertaining film; one to be recommended, not one for the records.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A look at life as we (don't) know it: unsentimental, unspectacular, honest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthew King is a lucky man. Being a native of Hawaii, he is living in paradise, he is the inheritor of one of the last untouched bays on Oahu and a direct descendant of Hawaii's last great king, he has a successful law practice, a beautiful wife and two wonderful daughters. But when we hear him at the start of the film, we do not hear a happy man. This is no paradise, he says, and by the way, he hasn't been on a surfboard in year. It's his wife who is the daring, life-loving part of the marriage - and it is she who falls into a coma after a boating accident. When the film begins, Matt's world is shattered and it will fall into even more pieces before he can try to pick up the shattered parts and move on. If there is such a thing.Following the surprise success of Sideways, Alexander Payne has taken on a successful novel and hired George Clooney as Matt. It has paid off: Clooney's bewildered face, helpless and searching and, after discovering his wife's secret, encased in an almost childlike anger, is often in close-up and carries the film. It is his eyes through which we see the world and discover the story and it is his state which dominates the films rhythm. When he is calm, the camera stays still, when he is in turmoil, it moves fast. This fascinating interaction between Clooney and the cinematography allows the viewer to experience the journey this character and his equally searching daughters are on. It is a journey of dead ends, of misunderstandings and pain, and ultimately, love. No false sentimentality here, just life, laconic, brutal, beautiful.Nobody exemplifies this journey more than Sid (Nick Krause). A stupidly grinning, annoyingly frank and simply obnoxiously happy teenage friend of Matt's oldest daughter, his presence on the journey is never fully explained. He is just there, suddenly, and remains. That's all there is to it and maybe that's life, too. Something happens, you don't know why and how but it's there. Sid is a sort of clown, infusing happiness where there should be none and denying the rule of rationality. As his presence cannot be rationally explained, he is the agent not of reason but of acceptance, acceptance of that which happens, whether it's good or bad, whether there seems to be a reason or not. What does is whether there is love and as long as this is so, all else can be overcome.And no, this is no paradise - or maybe it is. This Hawaii is beautiful, sublime and at the same time pedestrian, even sad. Sky and sea are mostly blue - with some grey patches - nature is green but there is always a slight mist over the scenery, the colors are a little pale as if this world is there but not quite. Matt moves, at least at first, like a sleepwalker through this life which is suddenly his own but which he cannot recognize. The misty images, the pale colors reflect this near-dreamlike state, this in-between status, this limbo he is in, a reflection of the real limbo of his wife.In a way, The Descendants is a growing-up story - not so much for the girls, but for Matt himself as he leaves the imagined life behind, makes peace with the real life hidden behind the facade - and with his still beloved wife - and starts out into a new one, reconnecting with his children, rebuilding the family, he the backup, the surrogate parent. Cautiously, insecurely, clumsily but honestly. Just like Sideways, The Descendants is a quiet, unassuming, complex and moving although totally unsentimental gem, about the big things: life, death, pain, love. Nothing less.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy contender at the 84th Academy Awards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the novel by Kaui Hart, The Descendants is a situational dramedy of a family in crisis that isn't too far from reality. A perfect dosage of awkward comedy keeps the pace of the film delightful to follow, even with its tragic storyline. There is a wide variety of characters and the film does an extraordinary job of exposing each of their individual personalities. Each character is faced with a new responsibility and has to overcome their personal issues by working with each other. The story revolves around a Matt King (George Clooney) and his two daughters, in what has become a very dysfunctional family. As the story thickens the audience is given both sides of the story and things become less black and white, thus challenging your own disposition and burrowing its way into your memory bank for a long time. In my opinion The Descendants far exceeds Payne's 2004 film Sideways, which is a similar character study film. The Descendants has already taken home two Golden Globe Awards and is a well deserving contender at the 84th Annual Academy Awards.</fullReview>

The plot is bleak and sad, as it details a successful man's grieving process towards the loss of his wife. Despite the sad backdrop of the story, the story still focuses on the positive outcome after the challenges are dealt with. The beautiful natural scenery and the abundance of bright colours balance the depressing tone of the film. The family dynamics between him and the two daughters are also well portrayed, and we see subtle but satisfying shifts throughout the film. There is great story telling, as the film keeps people wanting the story to unfold. I was captivated throughout the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alexander Payne burst onto the movie scene in 1999 with the darkly humorous Election for which he garnered an Oscar nomination for the screenplay that he co-wrote. He quickly followed that up with About Schmidt in which Kathy Bates and Jack Nicholson grabbed Oscar nominations for best actor and actress, in 2004 he picked up a further 5 nominations for Sideways (including best director and best movie)and his first award (again for best writing).It's been a seven year wait for his fourth outing (in between times he's mainly done TV) and guess what, he's done it again. Another five nominations, mostly for the biggies (writing, yet again, director, movie, actor and editing). Unless you hadn't gathered from this Alexander Payne is one of the most consistent and reliable writers, directors and movie makers in Hollywood today and The Descendents is his best yet. It also confirms George Clooney as undeniably the heir to De Niro's throne as Hollywood's best current actor (De Niro long ago having cashed in with a string of junk that defames his previously unblemished career).Each of Payne's films is different but similar. All have dark story lines at their centre and deal with big issues; ageing, sex, popularity, death. Each are hilariously funny (in fact you'd call Election, About Schmidt and Sideways comedies) but The Descendents ups the ante.The Descendants is an, at times, deeply moving story about trust, love and despair. It casts Clooney as the wronged husband and father; a career lawyer who's lost touch with his wife so that she embarks on an affair that sews together a plot that touches on greed, deceit and family values.Apart from the opening ten seconds , Clooney's wife spends the entire movie in a coma thereby forcing him to make proper emotional contact with his two daughters; ten year old princess in the making (Scottie played really well by Amara Miller) and 17 year old school boarder and problem child Alexandra (an oversight by the Academy for Best Supporting Actress) played by Shailene Woodley ? better known for US hit TV series; the Secret Life of the American Teenager. Woodley smokes throughout! What sets The Descendents apart and makes it a real live contender for best movie is its brilliant writing and acting and its ability to turn on a dime from humour to pathos. In this respect Clooney does indeed pull out all the stops (in as unexaggerated a style as only Clooney can do when pulling stops out) in his role which sees him on screen throughout. His despair is muted but tangible and the final scene pretty much breaks your heart.This is a very fine movie indeed and may yet surprise the bookmakers come February 26th. Here's hoping because from where I sit it was 2011's best nominated movie (Drive being ludicrously overlooked by the Academy)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid drama, simple yet complicated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Alexander Payne since About Schmidt, because I love the way he manages to keep things simple and clearly structured throughout. And this film is no exception. The story is pretty simple: Matt King is owner of a large parcel of Hawaiian land along with his family, as they are the distant descendants of the people who first came to that island and claimed it hundreds of years ago. But that's really just a part of the story. It's mainly about family struggle and mid-life crisis. King's wife suffered a boating accident in the fist few frames of the film and is in a coma throughout it. In her will it said she wanted King to live together with their two daughters Alexandra and Scottie. I won't reveal any more here, but I can say that all the actors, especially Clooney as Matt and Woodley as Alexandra, put in a great performance and their characters are all completely believable. It's been a while since I last saw drama executed this well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A character driven human tragic-comedy that's made with all the care and attention a great painter would give to his masterpiece. Every scene has been crafted with utmost care and attention. Character interaction is polished completely smooth so it slides gracefully along. So much has gone in to making this movie perfect that it becomes stifling. You feel like you've come to an art gallery rather than a cinema. Indeed, 'The Descendents' seems to exist to be admired rather than enjoyed. All the cast give flawless performances, although George Clooney (Matt King) appears overly preoccupied with bringing subtlety to his role. Shailene Woodley (Alexandra King) and Amara Miller (Scottie King) deserve the most praise playing the daughters as they deal with the illness then death of their mother and the consequences. Unfortunately Director/Screenwriter Alexander Payne forgets to inject any pace or good old fashioned fun. His previous efforts include the excellent 'Sideways', which managed to be enjoyably humorous as well as beautifully made. Humour in 'The Descendents' is low key and self consciously quirky. Film snobs will no doubt laugh loudly to show the rest of the audience how much they appreciate this. Interesting fact, Payne was a screenwriter for 'Jurassic Park 3'. A dinosaur or two here would certainly have improved my enjoyment as I sat there slipping into boredom. Sometimes in life a rough diamond is preferable to a flawless one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a delightful film to watch. It is wonderfully paced, well directed and an excellent cast to the boot. The Descendants is not a simple film, but ones that deals with complicated emotions and how people deal with life, when it gives them the lemon plus a little more. Set in the paradise state of Hawaii, the story of George Clooney's character is nothing, but paradise. What made this such a pleasing experience is the manner in which the director just eases the audience into the movie. This is an unique and effective way to keep the audience engaged without over-stuffing them with intoxicating details or dialogue.George Clooney performs outstandingly well in most likely his career best against the usual type display as the conflicted father dealing with family issues, business, potential death of his wife as well as the shattering news of knowing his wife was having an affair. None of these are forced upon the audience, but rather Clooney uses emotions, happenings, surrounding and even a road trip to let the audience into the movie and experience the experiences with him. Shailene Woodley who plays the daughter here is an absolute delight to watch. Let's hope she continues her natural screen presence into a good career. She is certainly one to watch in the coming years ahead.All in all, The Descendants is a wonderful movie, a little tragic, a little emotional, a little bit of heart and a little bit of fun. It is a delightful yet unfortunate piece of drama that allows the actors to immerse into their roles as they slowly creeps into the minds of the audience and ultimately somehow winning their hearts along the way. The film feels like a journey and by the end of the credits, there is something refreshing about this film that makes it better than it is. Maybe it is George Clooney or maybe it is just the human condition, but whatever it is, The Descendants is a fine film to boot? Neo rates it 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Refreshingly realistic and deftly embellished with amazing camera work, The Descendants is a film which would definitely give the moviegoer his money's worth without any scope for complaining. The plot revolves around Matt King(George Clooney), the sole trustee of a huge piece of exquisite Hawaiian property, caught in a cobweb of emotional convolutions after his wife slips into coma mode. Having remained aloof from familial bonds for a long time, Matt has to now refresh his relationship with his two daughters Scotty (Amara Miller)and Alex (Shailene Woodley). Every actor sinks their teeth into their roles and churns out highly commendable performances. Depicting a wide range of emotions with an amazing austerity and aplomb, George Clooney sucks you into Matt King's world almost effortlessly. Shailene Woodley, as the rebellious 17 year old, gives a riveting performance which hints at a very promising future for the young star. Amara Miller, as the younger of the two girls, adds a quaint innocence to the film. Nick Krause, as Alex's friend, tickles your ribs adding the required dose of subtle humor. Director Alexander Paynne does a great job, holding your attention during the entire running time of the film and deserves kudos for rendering to the audience a near perfect visual and emotional experience.The film can bring a smile on to your face during several moments and in the same breath make you feel the pain of the characters in a non melodramatic way. Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

Also some good performances from other cast including Shailene Woodley as the teenage daughter.It's about a middle aged guy who's a trustee for inherited family property more than some of us can ever dream of. Ever wondered what kinda problems them rich guys have? After his wife's accident he has a few challenges to face, reconnect with his daughters and some important decisions to make.

		<shortDescription>"Life-affirming and low-keyed study of character..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American screenwriter and director Alexander Payne's fifth feature film was shot on different locations in Hawaii and is an adaptation of a novel by American writer Kaui Hart Hemmings. The screenplay was written by Alexander Payne, Nat Haxon and Jim Rash. It tells the story about Matt King, a middle-aged husband and father of two who lives in Honolulu where he has a law practice. Matt is the sole trustee of a family trust that will expire in seven years due to a rule against perpetuities and with his family members he has decided to sell it to a man named Don Holitzer, but when his wife Elizabeth ends up in a coma after a boating accident, Matt is left to take care of his spirited 10-year-old daughter Scottie and his independent 18-year-old daughter Alexandra.Alexander Payne's beautifully and well directed contemporary film draws a remarkable portrayal of a father who finds himself in a very challenging situation when he gets to know the secrets of his hospitalized wife who he is hoping will wake up from her coma and has to raise his two daughters on his own. Focusing on the relationship between two young sisters and their relationship with their distressed and conscientious father, this character-driven and dialog-driven comedy manages to convey essential parts of family life, and is an engagingly narrated story about family relations, marriage, upbringing and reconciliation with harmonic and realistic milieu depictions.The great production design by Alexander Payne's frequent collaborator Jane Ann Stewart and the predominant use of light reinforces the multifaceted atmosphere in this well-paced and finely tuned American production which is finely photographed by Greek cinematographer and director Phedon Papamichael. Alexander Payne's endearing, life-affirming and low-keyed study of character has a gripping and understated acting performance by American actor George Clooney in a somewhat atypical role and a notable acting performance by American actress Shailene Woodley in her debut feature film role. A humorous, subtle and bittersweet drama which has gained numerous film awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film's truly touching story is perfected by great performances from the entire cast, making this a must watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's only one wish this humble columnist could ask for in his lifetime, it would be to age as gracefully as George Clooney.Look, the guy is 50 ? and how is it even possible that he manages to remain so charmingly appealing and attractively charismatic? And don't get us started on how many awards the good looker has bagged. After winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar with 2005's Syriana, he could be completing the collection with a Best Actor accolade at this year's Academy Awards. After being nominated for his leading roles in Michael Clayton (2007) and Up in the Air (2009), Gorgeous George could be the one taking home that statuette this year, thanks to his heartfelt performance in this comedy drama.Seriously, who else can look so dazzling wearing Hawaiian T shirts?Based on Kaul Hart Hemmings' novel of the same name, Clooney plays a Hawaiian land baron who takes his daughters on a trip from Oahu to Kauai. This isn't a family holiday, however, as the successful businessman's main objective is to confront the man who was having an affair with his wife. The heart wrenching part? The woman is on life support after a boating accident and she may not survive the misfortune.Before you think this is one sob story which contains an intolerable amount of melodrama, let us assure you that this is one genuinely affecting film which will make you laugh, cry, and most importantly, tug at your heartstrings. After all, the production is directed by Alexander Payne, the man who brought you About Schmidt (2002) and Sideways (2004). Together with Nax Faxon and Jim Rash, the Oscar winning writer director has penned a screenplay that is both funny and moving.Payne does not rush into things, having enough screen time to develop his characters. You'll find yourself being nicely acquainted to Clooney's protagonist, as he tells you how Hawaii isn't the paradise every one perceives it to be. There are problems and issues which are faced by people in any other part of the world. In this instance, he has one huge problem of dealing with a dying wife, two rebellious daughters, a adulterer who slept with his wife, a disapproving father in law and a rowdy teenager whom his elder daughter insists on bringing along for the trip.This is one load of mess which you won't ever want to find yourself in. Yet, thanks to Clooney's suave portrayal of the troubled man, you see hope and possibility in this confused times. His perfect Golden Globes winning performance is complemented by an ensemble of supporting cast, including the luminous Shailene Woodley (TV's The O.C.) as the defiant elder daughter, the adorable first time child actor Amara Miller as the younger daughter, as well as Matthew Lillard (Scooby Doo) and Judy Greer (13 Going on 30) as the unfaithful man and his unknowing wife.The newly crowned Best Picture (Drama) at this year's Golden Globes is a touching examination on how you take that journey in life when it throws you off balance. Shot on location in Hawaii around Hanalei Bay and in Honolulu, this 115 minute film is that perfect respite you've been looking for in the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clooney's best till date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants-Its hard to categorize The Descendants into a particular film genre- drama with tragic undercurrents yet tinged with dollops of comedy resulting in a bittersweet feature which appeals to one and all. There is a strong Oscar buzz around this one, and you would think the star of The Descendants is George Clooney. I believe there are two more in addition- Hawaii itself, and Shailene Woodley.Clooney plays Matt King, a workaholic lawyer having lost all linkages with his family life, and hailing from Hawaii's first white landowning family is suddenly faced with deep personal challenges- his carefree wife meeting with an accident and ending up in a coma which turns out to be a permanent one, and him having to decide on a sale of virgin forest land that belongs to his family. Things take a turn for the worse when he finds out that his wife was committing adultery, and when he starts having second thoughts on the land sale. His world completely falls apart when he has to re-establish a connect with his rebellious daughters. And there is this vast supporting cast of friends and relatives of this family, each united in their stand to sell their land for their selfish gains. The remainder of the movie deals with how this family copes with their issues, comes together to take important decisions, find their peace and at the same time, learn to move on in life, and let go of certain things for the better.Essentially, all the characters in the movie are extremely normal people with lots of problems and no solutions in sight- superficially fine but actually lost. The eldest daughter, played marvelously by the beautiful Shailene Woodley, shows all the characters of an angst ridden teen experimenting with drugs, alcohol and promiscuity, and harbouring a deep antipathy towards her mother for knowing her secret. Clooney, for once gets to play his age ? he is not slick and charismatic, but scruffy, dishevelled most of the time. He displays a range of emotions- he is at once lost, embittered, funny, confused yet has to stand tall to take care of his rapidly disintegrating world, gain the respect of his family and make tough decisions. He is there in every frame of the movie, and is a solid Oscar contender for his role in this.The film is completely shot in Hawaii, a photographer's paradise, full of beautiful scenic islands kissed by oceans in different hues of blue and green makes the movie fulfil a dual role- that of a travelogue too! The lovely Hawaiian soundtrack makes the movie feel all the more poetic. Having said that, considering the word of mouth and the surrounding hoopla, i was expecting more- i was expecting more dramatic punch, more feel from the movie like Warriors had, but at the end it felt like a family sitcom in an exotic locale.This isn't a popcorn movie, and nor is it something that will make you begin to question the essence of life. Nevertheless, it is a touching movie with tear jerking moments, and smile inducing ones too. The Descendants does a great job of creating a cohesive story that has themes of family bonding and making important decisions, central to it. Releasing this weekend in India- 10/10 for Clooney fans and i trust there are a lot, and a solid 7/10 for others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George-ous yet a Payneful Triumph!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants is a movie that I was anticipating from quite a very long time mainly because of its critical acclaim at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. As it was expected, the movie lives up to the expectations and at times manages to surpass it too. First of all, it's all and all a total George Clooney movie. In each and every scene you will see Clooney unleashing his acting prowess (FYI I've never seen him perform so flawlessly before). To put it in more simplistic and a conventional way, The Descendants is basically a Family drama centered around Matt king, a land baron from Hawaii who tries to reconnect with his two daughters after his wife suffers a tragic boating accident and goes into comatose. This, as you can see a serious situation but the director Alexander Payne adroitly manages to put a touch of humor into it and the final product is nothing less than a masterpiece. The Descendants features an outstanding cast, each of whom has their stand-out moment. Clooney makes Matt King a personable, perplexed, thoughtful yet an imperfect leading man, and he does some of his best work without a dialog. Apart from him, the beautiful Shailene Woodley is extraordinarily effective as his belligerent teenage daughter, wary of her absentee father's sudden involvement in her life and bitterly angry towards her mother. What ties it all together is the movie's magnificent script, which seamlessly blends comedy and drama. OVERALLIf you have a hunger for great acting, The Descendants is a feast. Led by George Clooney in the most immaculate performance of his career, it manages to strike that rare balance between funny and heart-breaking. Emotional indulgences aside, The Descendants resonates deeply. It has that rare fusion of amazing direction (Hats off to Alexander Payne) and sensational performances. Undoubtedly, one of the best of 2011. Do not miss this top quality cinema which is seldom made these days. Highly Recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not really prepared for what I experienced in the 115 minutes of 'The Descendents'. At the end of it I came away richer, thinking about human life and relationships, histories, responsibilities and 'fragilities'. Payne does it with a disarming, refined and mature ease, never letting go of you as an audience - its like listening to a good trusting friend you love hearing from. That is indeed a directorial achievement. Clooney we know is a capable actor, and in this film, he shines and yes he made me shed a tear.Put this in the backdrop of the essential elements of ocean (water) mountain (earth) , breeze (air) and ashes (fire) of Hawaii and you will love your family as only you can.Payne and Clooney, take a splendid bow!(Prolonged Applause)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Film with Mixed Messages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt this is an entertaining film and watchable from beginning til end, though the concept of the film about a dying wife in a Hospital bed and a cold Husband who is more intent on finding his wife's lover than spending valuable quality time (such as it could be) at her bedside in her last moments delivered mixed messages.The most gripping part is the Father Matt King managing the relationship with his two Daughters whom it was suggested early on in the film with whom he spent little, if any, time. Now, by enforced circumstances, he had to become a real Father.The film was interesting for the different 'takes' on life in Hawaii and nice shots from round the Archipelago. In a way, it is a sort of 'Eat Pray Love" which for me is a much much better film.This particular film presented another ego trip for George Clooney, in the same way 'Ides of March" and "Up in the Air" plus 'The Good German".Matt King was an overworking husband and so hence, it is suggested, not a functional husband for his wife who sought attentions elsewhere. does that sound familiar to anyone? I thought the ex-pats living in Hawaii and mixing with the locals and the extravagance of the Hawaiian aristocracy in what they could or would do with their inheritance was laughable at best and not the kind of escapism most of us want to associate with.the concept of the story is good in linking the wife's lover with the inheritance but the film was obsessed with issues not bringing those issues cohesively together. At the end, did we feel any sympathy for the dying wife? Who came to visit her in the Hospital from all the abundant friends she apparently had? There are better films in circulation deserving for winning the top awards. Nominate yes, win no. As for the Sid character, obnoxious and though with a sensitive tale to tell of his own, wasteful material in the overall story line.Brian the so called lover was easily track-able and Matt the Lawyer would undoubtedly have known who he was in normal circumstances.the film made me wonder - is this some sort of family history story of someone famous? Does George Clooney have Hawaian blood in him? Watch out for some of the expletives spoken by the kids, a negative about the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Regret</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing lots of movies with bombs, explosions, shots, attacks, computer special violent side effects et alia it's good to see a movie where there is nothing of that and only feelings and sentiments (most often good ones), nice images, excellent acting and meaningful dialogues and behaviours. A married woman is in hospital in a deep coma after a boat accident when her husband knows from their eldest daughter that she has been unfaithful to him with another man. This unchains a situation of great and deep emotion (though very contained and avoiding any kind of melodrama) driving the husband (George Clooney) in an obsessive mood and intention of knowing who his wife's lover was and even meeting and talking to him in which he is helped by that same daughter. The whole story is told in very humane terms involving the relationship the father maintains with her two daughters and their reactions all this in very true and psychological realistic conditions and expressions. Intertwined with this there is a heritage problem regarding the decision about selling of a large land inherited by the main character's large family and which they must soon decide to sell for a fortune to be urbanized or not. All this runs in the middle of the beautiful landscape, seascape and flowers of Hawaii shown here in beautiful images. And the last scenes intend to show us that even after the worst of dramas life goes on often peacefully and quietly. This movie deals in a superb way with several aspects of nowadays life: marital and extramarital relations, filial relations, health problems, life and death, love, kids' behaviour and even business problems. And does all this in a veracious and truthful way without resorting to very dramatic scenes but to very moving ones anyway using mainly the facial expressions of characters to show us their deep emotions. But above all this movie is about the terrible regret for what you should have done for your beloved wife (or husband) and can't do anymore because she (or he) is now already dead. One of the best movies of last years indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, Some of the plot a little dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The actors performed exactly as they should and the character Sid or whatever his name was, was interesting. Throughout the movie Clooney talks about a trust of land his family is going to sell and he is the trusty and it is his decision on whether to sell or not. Its to obvious of a plot line that in the end he is not going to sell. Also when the family is sitting around in the room with their dying mother it gets a bit boring. Otherwise, I thought the affair and how Clooney handles it is hilarious. The daughters are a bit predictable throughout the movie also. They start evil hating their father and all of that stuff. Then they slowly get closer and closer. The misery in paradise theme of the movie was genius. I mean it is difficult to show someone so upset and distraught when they live in such a place with such a large amount of money and you can actually feel this throughout the movie. Getting back to Sid, he comes into the movie a little strong with complete disregard for anyones feelings but Alexandras and seems a little dumb... but without that character i would have given this movie a 6 or a 5 and a half if i could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No one will probably ever read this but what the hell.This was a pretty weird film. It 'promotes' what I see around me which is the boomer generation acting like adolescents because they don't want to 'age' so they treat their kids like siblings instead of like children which is bad for everyone involved.It also shows the shallowness of our times, aging, entitled, dysfunctional boomers living the high life with inherited money they didn't earn, living like hobo kings in Hawaii, the 1st generation that was weaned on Television, the medium which so heavily exudes eternal youth, having to deal with aging and death and having to be the 'adults' when they've never been able to grow up themselves because of the influence of Television. And to prove my point, the very last scene is of Clooney and his two daughters staring straight at you because YOU are the television and THEY are the audience and they're watching March of the Penguins -- this is how they're dealing with the death of their mother -- by turning on the TV and tuning out! The only reason I can see this movie getting such high accolades is because I think our culture is SO desperate for direction on the issue of death and dying that it's grasping at even a shallow movies like this one out of desperation. The irony is that the alienation that's causing people to turn to movies like this one is the medium of television and movies themselves.The only redeeming quality of this film is that the George Clooney character decides not to sell off a huge chunk of Hawaiian land that's been in his family for a few generations so it doesn't get developed into a resort (yeah, dream on!). I doubt that would happen in real life but it does send a good message I suppose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the problem: this is not meant to be just a postcard or beautiful music that sings about love or loss. No, it's meant to be a deep, spiritual, cathartic vision. Oh there is plenty of whimsy but only because it's best we approach death with some humor.Now if a film like this is going to matter at all, ideally it should cinematically define the experience we only have words for, make it life that consumes the trivial details and leaves something pure to recall. There are several masters who strive for this, there is Malick now, Kusturica once upon a time.So watching this after a work from those guys is like going from a master who has forgotten about the instrument and is the music he plays to someone who is still looking up the notes now and then to make sure he gets it right. And what he can't play he will write down for you.And something else that explains heaps about this.Here's a world that our guy is meant to understand is fleeting and transient, one of sorrowful beauty, and the parting notion is that our lot in life should be kept to the end, supposedly to keep from encroachment. This supposes it was beauty or this place that forged the lasting memory that fondly persists to this day, and completely misses the more refined notion: that it was two souls meeting each other openly and with a desire to love that forged beauty, forged the beautiful memory the place recalls, and so any moment and any place is impregnated with the possibility. You have to assume that the filmmaker missed this at the writing stage when he introduced the younger sister as photographing death because she heard this is how you celebrate life, framing as art, and never pursued this any further.So of course the whole thing is filmed for stately beauty. Reflections are only reasoned about and rarely in a cinematic manner. Our protagonist does not really have to struggle to grow. He only lets go of the one thing he can't hold any more, and clings to what is left behind. It's a clean role, ideal for Clooney who was presumably looking for a role that conveys pain that is relatively harmless and does not hurt. So this is a lot like Hawaii: tampered beauty mistaken for purity. A postcard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best word to summarize it, would be dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's one of those experiences you don't really consider repeating sooner in the near future. Beside some good acting, and the fact they've invested into image quality, The Descendants doesn't has much left. The plot is linear, with nothing entertaining at all, so I wouldn't recommend seeing it in cinemas, unless you enjoy being part of an overall feeling of boredom. However, because one of the few aces this movie has in its sleeve is image quality, I would say the best choice would be to watch it home, on DVD with the rest of the family, if you really feel the need too.To be honest, even if it looks good, most scenes were taken somewhere indoors or near some house, with very few unimpressive landscapes, even if the action takes place in Hawaii, therefore I strongly believe they could had done a lot better. To say it short, they've invested in picture quality for nothing, 'cause I don't think anybody wants to see some really good clear pictures of furniture, walls and occasionally a car in traffic. There was not a single scene that remained on my retina, at least for a little while. The story has depth, so I would recommend it especially to those superficial, really shallow individuals, as they might learn a thing or two about life. That's about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After you get past the beautifully colorful opening credits and the intentionally unpleasant street scenes of urban Hawaii, unnecessarily underlining George Clooney's opening monologue assertion that he is NOT living in a "paradise," this quiet, aggressively LITTLE film slowly draws one in as it tries to create a believable look at an essentially good man trying to hold his life and family together while coming to grips with the fact that not only is the wife he loves but has grown apart from in a coma (from a boating accident) and unlikely to recover, but his discovery that she apparently had been having an affair in the months leading up to the accident.The film's great achievement is that it avoids obvious soap opera temptations as firmly as it avoids either laughs or tear jerking opportunities. Its tragedy is that it ALSO avoids any revelations for anyone who has ever lost a loved one or is over the emotional age of a Justin Bieber fan. Golden Globe winner George Clooney, the apparent front runner for this year's Oscar as Best Actor raises underacting and subdued reactions with an occasional stifled slow burn thrown in for variety to a near art form but audiences in the mood for emotional depth will find themselves in the shallow end of the thespianic pool.The best thing in the film (other than its very thin slice of upper-upper-middle class life - a side issue of poor relations who might benefit from a proposed sale of open space land which socially conscious relatives rightly want to preserve is essentially ignored - and the ingratiating persona of Clooney) is the charming underscoring of mood setting Hawaiian music. One might wish that at least some of the lyrics were sung in English for the emotional support they might have given the script - presuming the lyrics DID.There are some irritants ongoing though the film - the clueless "boyfriend" Clooney's eldest daughter has with her for emotional support and Clooney's unsupportive father-in-law (with problems of his own) chief among them - that the director seems to think add to the film's credibility, but over all the film IS true and fair to its characters. Had someone other than Clooney chosen to make this property their vehicle, it might have been a wildly comic tragedy, and actually more entertaining, but it wouldn't have the intellectual integrity Clooney's presence brings it. Its just a pity that the end result is so terribly minor and ultimately forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Descendants. . . Definitely Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A long-awaited tale of reconnection and healing? C'mon. . . I love George Clooney and I really wanted this film to be great. But, for me, it truly wasn't. Not that it was a terrible movie? it was just okay. I had high expectations that this movie was not able to satisfy. . . . even though gorgeous Hawaiian scenery and gorgeous George Clooney provided pleasant viewing. The storyline: The wife of often-absent husband Matt King (Clooney) had a boating accident and is in a hospital on life support. They have 2 daughters, Alex (17 years old) and Scottie (10 years old and somewhat obnoxious). Alex reveals to Dad that Mom had an affair. Soon, Matt discovers that it was real estate agent/broker, Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard,) with whom his wife cheated. Of course(?), Matt drags along his two daughters and Sid (an unnecessary character and Alex's little-known pal) to the island of Kauai to track down Brian, the married lowlife. It is highly unbelievable (or else, despicable) to me that a caring, loving father would take his young daughters on a quest to meet/confront the offending adulterer. How inappropriate is that. . . even for a cuckold? And just for good measure: bring along your daughter's stoner pal on this personal, family journey?? Maybe I shouldn't even point out that this island-hopping quest takes place while abandoning Mom, who is still in a coma in the hospital. Then, there's this weak subplot which actually sounds better here than it plays out in the movie: Matt King (on behalf of his extended family) is struggling over the moral aspects of a deal to sell a huge stretch of beautiful, virgin Hawaiian land, which has belonged to the King clan for more than a century.This 115- minute film seemed rather "stretched" in many ways. The only thing amazing about it is that it received so many award nominations and wins. So, yes, that fact alone makes me pause and wonder if I should see it again on DVD. Maybe someday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just seeing the movie's stills would give you a fair idea of what to expect from the movie.The story is about how a middle aged man gets in term with his daughters and his own emotions when his wife is in coma and could die in a week. Though this is not a story that would make everyone rush to the theaters, the treatment given to the story gets you glued to the seat throughout the movie and applaud at the end.Performances : George Clooney pulls out an excellent performance for which he will be remembered for. This is a role where there is so much scope for overacting or even under-acting. George has done a great job in not doing any of the above and do what a person who is in the situation will actually do. Shailene Woodley's performance is notable. Her expressions and body language are perfect for the role and of course, she is cute :) All the other actors also did their job perfectly.Screenplay, direction : Given the storyline, there is plenty of chance this movie could have been a complete bore. But Alexander Payne has given a great treatment to the movie that there you don't see your watch even once during the movie. Lots of humorous one-liners that are perfectly placed make sure that there is not a single dull moment in the movie.Cinematography, art and other technicalities : The locations are very pleasant. There are lots of metaphors out there for artistic movie lovers. Cameraman has got everything right from capturing the beauty of the locations to capturing the emotions of actors.The background music is good. But could have been better. Other than that, this is a movie that will linger in your mind for many days after you watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...it's just, I didn't like it. Alright, I'm not sure if I'm putting it the right way. I liked lots about it, but I also disliked lots about it.Actually, I'm not sure if "lots" is the right word either. This is one maddening film.First off, I am more then familiar than Alex Payne. After all he did do my favourite movie of 2005, Sideways. However I absolutely hated About Schmidt. I thought it was boring tripe, but I decided to put that aside and watch it on the strength of Sideways alone. And boy, was I dead wrong.The film follows a real estate agent in Hawaii, Matt King, whose wife has ended up in a bad accident that has thrust her into a near death state. With the tragedy affecting his already broken family, he reunites with his bitchy teenage daughter, who spends the movie with some douchebag I couldn't for the life of me care about. She reveals that his wife had an affair with a rival agent of his, which leads him to seek him out to confront him face to face, and seal the deal on a piece of land he owns.First off, I liked Clooney. He was the film, and without him I would have been bored outright. He's the one thing keeping it watchable. Oh, and it was shot beautifully too.But... The film just bored me.First off, it's SO PREDICTABLE. I predicted the whole thing with the land and how Matt would decide he wanted to keep the land instead of selling it. I predicted how he'd fall for Speer's wife. I predicted that Speer had a wife and kids too. Seriously, how did you not see it coming? The characters were boring as hell. The only memorable one was Beau Bridges and he was only in the film for 6 minutes. Speer was so clichéd in terms of development.Oh, and worst of all- it was so full of clichés. You can tell how it's going to end from the opening scene, and you can essentially think to yourself "I think this is going to happen" and -gasp- it does! But, it is prettily shot. I guess that's all that's needed to constitute Oscar bait nowadays. This isn't a bad film but it has every right to be, and the fact that it is up against The Artist for best picture is just laughable, because The Artist really does deserve the award. Don't kid yourself. This film is really forgettable.</fullReview>

It is mostly light and easy to watch, substance-free entertainment. I'm sure many will like that about it. It did not feel as if the time spent watching it took an age to pass, but neither did it fly past inciting the desire for more. I was glad the film ended and I was once again giving time to consider something with more purpose than it.This film does facilitate a decent performance from George Clooney, but even that is only at very few moments demanding. I laughed a few times and appreciate that the soundtrack was largely, if not entirely, Hawaiian. 'The Descendants' was also pretty well shot, but by no means spectacular given the location.I hope I've not been to vague or harsh. Please don't get me wrong, this film is okay and difficult to fault based on component focused objective criticism, but I fail to see why it has been raved about. It is okay and nothing more! If this is considered amongst the best of the past 12 months then the bar of cinema quality really must be raised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 'What Went Wrong' Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne crafted the truly entertaining, politically astute and socially aware "Election," (particularly) "Sideways," "About Schmidt," and "Citizen Ruth." However, his recent efforts, (as Producer) "Cedar Rapids" and "The Descendants," fall far from previous achievements."The Descendants," while a good story, is tepid and inappropriately arch. Mr. Clooney mugs and performs in his inimitable way, yet there's a lack of connection as if he's bored and not vested in the story. Just like the rest of the characters who also seem to have suffered from the effects of too much Hawaiian sun.There's little juice in the drama, too little comedy. "The Descendants" is stuck in a crossfire of unsatisfied, shifting tones (compared to the precise balance in "Sideways").Mr. Clooney is a hapless Dad left to raise two troubled daughters when their cheating, near-death, comatose mother is hospitalized after a boating accident. There's an added dollop of social consciousness via the descendant's pending $500 million dollar sale of primo Hawaiian oceanfront passed down from Hawaiian royalty. It's what you expect from a Payne film but the execution is flaccid. It's also too bad American imperialism is only inferred. The path leads to a predictable 'let's not sell the land' payoff that's a yawn. The opening voice-over comments that in this Heaven-on-Earth people are people with the same problems as everyone else: marital infidelity, 21st century child rearing and great responsibility. Not quite as heady as brilliantly deconstructing lying male behavior or dissecting both sides of the thorny abortion issue to find them equally insane.Like a warm Tropical breeze, "The Descendants" softly brushes the cheek. It's pleasant, but ultimately it's just moving air.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Universal problem found now in HawaiiI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 3:30am. I can't sleep. A few hours ago I joined what I thought was to be a quirky super dysfunctional family in Hawaii. From the start you got sucked in. Good writing does that.You know many of these people. How come they are now living in Hawaii? Poor Grorge Cloony. We watch as his life and control slips away. He stares at the ceiling so much that I wondered if he was checking for cracks to fall. What a restrained performance. Any second you expect him to explode. Everyone around him walks on him, ignores him as he is bloodless. His power as an actor has grown here. His performance will suck you in. I want to deal with my suffering in Allentown. Hawaii is too beautiful. Adding some fun and charm are 2 dynamite young ladies. They play his his rebellious daughters who require a chair and whip and plenty of ice cream. The tension mounts. I can't get over the final scene. You will see Cloony tear out his heart for you in a close-up you won't forget. I always feared death. Now I think about who should go first. They are the lucky ones. Terrific photography and haunting authentic Hawaiian music. Someone was brave to green-light this film. Your bravery will serve you well as your bank accounts will grow with each week.Folks run or move fast to buy your tickets. Take your wife, ex wife, your current affair, old folks and young. I promise that it will touch a nerve in all of you. Bring Hankies...if George Cloony can release so can you. PS- This is not a Chick FLick nor a guy film. You need to all share this together. After the film hits, (around 3:30 am) I know the magic in each other's arms will make the entire evening. ALOHA to all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a conservative movie from the philosophical point of view. Absolutely nothing to do with crude Punch and Judy politics, but a rich, satisfying meditation on what we owe to posterity, that at any moment we live at a pivotal point between the future and the past and struggle to do right by both. The film constantly contrasts inadequacy, shallowness, and shortsightedness against grandeur, depth, and eternity, very often in the struggles of individual characters. The George Clooney character, while probably the most self-aware of the bunch, realizes what little he knows about important things in his life, including his daughters, wife, extended family, his role as a man, and the fate of Hawaii itself. We see the eldest daughter's perfectly natural adolescent shallowness smash against the rocks of mortality and adulthood.It may also be the only movie I've ever seen with fully realized characters who are living, dead, and in-between. But after awhile, we understand that the comatose wife's lack of situational awareness is only slightly deeper than anyone else's in the movie.The brilliance of this movie is that very little of this is explicitly sign-posted and we must make the inferences ourselves only from what we see on the screen. Payne recognizes the images are just that--a surface that an audience must dive beneath. Yes, he speaks to us with filmic language, but after that we are on our own.I withheld a tenth star as there were moments when I was aware that it was George Clooney up there on the screen, and I am a little uncomfortable with movies that get too heavy with the lesson plan. That's not what movies are really there to do. This one largely succeeds, but would you rather take 90 minutes from your life to watch "Stagecoach" or something as hideously didactic as "Inherit the Wind?"Less profoundly, I think this movie has the potential to do for Hawaiian music that "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" did for pre-Nashville country music. I'm keeping my eye out for the soundtrack album.</fullReview>

Could have a similar experience grabbing a seat in an ICU waiting room. If you are entertained by watching people suffer, in an often boring manner, this one is for you. Good acting, for sure. Would rather see average acting and a great story. Really, wondering who could leave this movie having been entertained. Save your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the Alexander Payne I've Come to Know and Love?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The point of "The Descendants," as the movie's thudding opening voice over narration tells us, is that even people in Hawaii can be miserable. Over the next two hours, the film makes this point pretty convincingly. Unfortunately, it made me miserable watching it.The quirky comedic vibe that has infused virtually every other Alexander Payne film -- the same vibe that has made something special of his movies and a big fan out of me -- is painfully absent in this gloomy film about a dysfunctional family coming to terms with the death of its wife and mother. Payne tries for it, but the result is a dud. The movie is, therefore, somewhat of a slog, morbid, depressing and slow.But those qualities might be easier to tolerate if the movie was good. Sadly, and surprisingly, it's not. It's not well written at all, a criticism I would never level at other Payne movies. The characters and situations don't make any sense, no matter how valiantly some of the actors (and there are good ones) try. George Clooney has been wildly overrated for his performance; it's simply a repeat of the morose, sad characters he's been playing for a while now, and we're expected to see greatness in his performance mostly because he allows some added gray in his hair and a few more lines around his eyes to subdue his movie star looks. But the actress who plays his oldest daughter, Shailene Woodley, is a standout, even though her character is one of the weakest written. Introduced to us as an out-of-control wild child, she seemingly makes amends with her father overnight and becomes his right-hand man, resolving without any effort one of the film's biggest dramatic conflicts. There's also a lovely performance from Judy Greer as the wife of the man with whom Clooney's wife was having an affair, but Payne undermines her performance at the last minute by abruptly and oddly disposing of her character in a scene that I think was meant to be funny (the fact that I'm not sure points to the movie's problems).There are moments that succeed in wringing tears, but they do it in a cheap way. Anyone would well up at the sight of a little girl being told her mother is going to die; it doesn't take especially good writing or directing to make that situation an emotional one.It displeases me greatly to have to say so, but I found almost nothing to recommend about "The Descendants." I guess every good filmmaker is allowed to stumble once in a while.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SO much potential.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I try not to go into movies with expectations, but I must admit- I was quite excited to see what this film had to offer after having read positive reviews and hints of Oscar nods. Over all, I was disappointed. This film contained such emotionally rich themes and circumstances, but rarely if ever allowed them to play out to their extraordinary potential. There were scenes that had the potential to develop into deeply emotional and touching moments, but something was always missing, and the scene would fall short. Shailene Woodley, playing the eldest daughter, gave a wonderful performance. For me, she was one of the more realistic teenage girls depicted in Hollywood today. Her male friend, on the other hand, was the exact opposite. I can only assume that his character was meant for comic relief, but he really had to opposite effect. But even his character had potential that went unrealized. The conversation between him and George Clooney at night on vacation provided a HUGE opportunity to show depth of character for this young man-- but there was no smooth direction of conversation to allow the two men to express themselves in any relatable way. The storyline follows the emotional journey of Clooney and his immediate family, as well as the extended family's decision to sell it's large property in Hawaii. The ultimate decision for the family to keep their property seemed nearly irrelevant at the end, it could have been incorporated to a more accessible concept that could be related back to the family's emotional struggle. Overall, the two story lines seemed detached, and could have easily been further connected to reinforce each other's importance. All in all, it was a entertaining film. Very, very interesting premise, I only wish it would have further explored some of the emotional intricacies that each character had the potential to portray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne returns to feature filmmaking with his first film since 2004's Sideways - for my money the best film of that year. I was hugely disappointed in this one, unfortunately. I guess I did hate his first two films, Citizen Ruth and Election, but I hated them because I found them mean-spirited. The Descendants is far from mean-spirited, so I didn't hate it like I did those two. It has a decent set-up and an interesting perspective. It's disappointing that it couldn't accomplish anything with them. George Clooney stars as a busy lawyer who has to take care of his two daughters exclusively after his wife went into a coma. Soon enough he learns that his wife is not going to come out of the coma, and his oldest daughter (Shailene Woodley, who gives the film's best performance), upon hearing the tragic news, reveals that the reason for the animosity she has shown to her mother is that she caught her cheating on her father. Clooney is doubly devastated, and decides to seek out his wife's paramour (Matthew Lillard). So, I haven't yet mentioned the biggest twist in this story: it takes place in Hawaii. So, yeah, right, that's not that big a twist is it? I mean, Clooney explicitly tells us through voice-over the second the film has opened that the story's Hawaiian setting will bear no effect on this story, that people in Hawaii live lives just like everyone else. So why do I feel like my four block trek through the snowflakes the size of rock salt to get to the theater feels like more of a tragedy than Clooney and his family losing their wife and mother? The film's biggest flaw is that Payne does treat Hawaii like a paradise. He's absolutely obsessed with its beauty, often stopping for pillow shots of gorgeous vistas or flowers. The film is scored with Hawaiian folk music, which is never not sweet and relaxing. Perhaps its impossible not to make Hawaii look like paradise, but it would help if Payne weren't so enamored of it. That isn't the film's only flaw however. Another big one is the character of Sid (Nick Krause), Woodley's doofus buddy, who tags along everywhere. He seems there at first to provide some comic relief, but he's just too stupid and insensitive to be real. The scene where he makes fun of Woodley's Alzheimer's suffering grandmother is ridiculous - no one is this moronically insensitive. And, even if they were, wouldn't you think that Clooney and even Woodley would be so fed up with them they'd never talk to him again? He only remains in the film because Payne wants to pull the rug out from under our expectations later in the picture by letting him reveal a personal secret, but the revelation is silly: if he himself had recently suffered tragedy, would he be so insensitive in the earlier sequences? He's just a very poorly conceived plot device (oh, but did the art-house audience cackle every time he said anything! Ugh!). Also, the younger daughter (Amara Miller) is too often used as a source of comedy, too. She's too cutesy, and her lines come off as too written. When she finally finds out about her mother's fate, late in the picture, the writers have no more use for her and I don't even think she gets a line. All that said, it's not anywhere near an awful film, just a misjudged one. Clooney is fine, and he gets at least one killer scene late in the picture. I have to admit I did tear up a little at the end. Beau Bridges and Robert Forster have good supporting roles. And, yes, Hawaii still looks beautiful.</fullReview>

Touching, human and every performance was extraordinary. Robert Forster was Oscar worthy in his small role of two breathtaking scenes, the young first time actor that plays Clooney's daughter's friend brought me to tears, and Judy Greer was amazing. And George Clooney does what he does best, brings a man to life. The word Extraordinary comes to mind over and over because this film is so above and beyond the ordinary. Its a triumph.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pray for no more of them...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone in The Descendants has a communication problem. Notwithstanding the plot where this issue is centerfold, the characters themselves have an irritating lack of ability to be expressive with each other as fast as they should be. The film inches along while we wait for them to do what we know has to happen: have frank conversation with each other. From this we are to derive humor and pulled heartstrings at calculated intervals. Two child characters exist entirely to allow the narrative to float in the realm of dramedy that Hollywood habitually uses to pluck savings from the elderly (or anyone else) during the holidays. This film may very well win an Academy Award despite its lacking nonfinancial reason to exist.Fortunately Alexander Payne's movie isn't as cringe-inducing as last year's The King's Speech. As you watch it you'll identify some saccharine avenues not indulged. They permit the film's flimsy story to avoid the hero worship these kinds of films love to invoke in favor of mere tedium and frustration. It's odd choice of casting to put George Clooney in the title role of Matt King. His recent characters of The American and The Ides of March are anything but the emasculated wimp he has to play here. That's actually the biggest problem with The Descendants. Payne's movie is too detached and unnecessarily cruel to King without offering him the opportunity to challenge his status quo until it ends.King is an overworked attorney with a troublemaking older daughter Alex, a younger daughter, and bored housewife. Before the film begins, his wife is nearly killed in a boating accident, and we are informed she was with her lover during the event. What follows from this doomed scenario is a series of vignettes where King investigates the affair by talking with supporting characters who humiliate him further. In fact most of the men in this movie are undermined by personality flaws when they attempt to behave assertively. Does Payne wish to make a statement about gender roles? No, we have to deal with the unbearable lightness of being a character in this film without any introspection on his part. A better approach would have been to drop the dramatic parts and treat the absurd concept as the comedy that it should be. Alex, played with spunk by newcomer Shailene Woodley, has a Hawksian quality in her relationship with her father. She isn't afraid to challenge him or express herself completely, but loves him enough to reveal her mother's infidelity. With an alteration of the script and a riskier director, this would have made a fine buddy movie. At least Woodley was able to escape television, and she would be well suited for modern screwballs.What calls attention to the viewer is the emanating nothingness that results from the film's faulty structure. Payne begins the movie with a Clooney monologue declaring that life in Hawaii (the setting) isn't just a vacation. The story fails to satisfy this observation by the repeated glamour shots of the countryside and its annoying main character. He even puts Woodley in a bikini top frequently to keep our focus when we aren't supposed to laugh. Don't fall for the eye candy. The Descendants is a bad movie, but its slight self-awareness keeps it afloat until you change the channel.Not Recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too long for a soap opera, too shallow for a drama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be hard not to go in to see this film with relatively high hopes. George Clooney managed to surprise me more than once, and I will admit to becoming somewhat of a fan thanks to his performances in "Up In The Air" and "Michael Clayton". In "The Descendents" he is brilliant as is the rest of the cast, especially Shailene Woodley (I predict great future for her!), and Nick Krause who was equally great. Other performances were also pleasure to watch, but that's where the list of film's good qualities ends.The film is a story about a rich lawyer (George Clooney) who is caught up in family drama when his wife ends up in coma due to a boating accident. The film is set in Hawaii, for no good reason, except to give us plenty of Hawaiian music, which I love but found annoyingly overused here; not to mention that it made no sense and felt disjointed in relation to the story.While many are touched by the drama of a mother/wife being in coma, I was not. The depiction was too shallow and predictable to be touching. Most everyone manages to be angry at her for her mistakes while she was alive, and the anger expressed, monologues told and drama that ensued were all too soap opera-ish to be interesting at all. No character made any real progress in any way, they all just stay their same not-so-smart selves. Those things which I wanted to see addressed somehow (e.g. the younger daughter's behavior), stay untouched. Those things which I'd rather not spend any time looking at such as a comatose woman's face, are shown in shots which drag on and on and on...All in all, if it were not for great performances, this film would be a terrible waste of time. This way, if you are film buff who needs to stay in the loop, you may want to see it just for those performances, although a film such as this one does not really have any drama to inspire anything Oscar worthy in any of the actors.Bottom line: great location such as Hawaii, long shots of dying wife and good actors, are not what makes a good film. Every great or even good film has something slightly magical about it, and this one has none of that, which is what makes such a bore.</fullReview>

I think I have some valid arguments.George Clooney tapped his inner George Clooney yet again. Not that it's bad. He's an enjoyable actor. But Oscar worthy? No. Clooney's character is now ready to be "there" in his family being that his wife is in a coma. Thus, he has had his arch even before the movie begins. And who was this awful person he was that made his wife cheat on him? We never know.Apparently he was, and is, very wealthy. A land deal will make him wealthier. But he's cheap. His wife cheated on him 'cause he was cheap? I dunno. Then he's angst-ridden over handling his kids. He sure seems like a good dad during the movie. What was he like before? I dunno.And who chooses to be a lawyer when he starts out wealthy? This character, which made me like him less. It's not like he was representing poor people. He was practicing boring law. And apparently ignoring his family 'cause of it. Why? I dunno.Then we have him chasing around the guy who slept with his wife. Okay, but it didn't really lead anywhere. And the coincidence of it all?! Ugh!Then we are at the end. I won't give it away but his motivation comes out of nowhere. Boo hoo for all the rich people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't believe the hype: this is a thin movie. George Clooney plays an everyman with a trust fund who, during the course of the film, reorients himself marginally on the moneymaking-family axis. That's it, folks. He has a pair of cute foul-mouthed daughters, a wife in a coma who has cheated on him, an extended family of laid-back cousins, and -- as the back-up child-rearer -- a terminal inability to recall his daughters' friends' names or remember when the pool cleaner will next arrive. In other words he's just like us except that he's gorgeous, has more money, is descended from island royalty, and lives on Oahu. If the film had been placed in Findlay, Ohio or cast with someone other than Clooney in the lead role, it would not have earned back its budget.Clooney is cast so far against type that he isn't believable. In the opening scenes, as he struggles with his daughters' acting out and learns of his wife's infidelity, he sputters like a sitcom character, like Ozzie Nelson on a bad day. Later he learns to cry, but the tears spring from nowhere. Ultimately the director's resolution points us to memories and ice cream in front of the family TV. Satisfied? I'm afraid I wasn't. This film is nothing but a feel-good gesture to middle American values wrapped in Hawaiian shirts and accompanied by a soundtrack of native Hawaiian music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the privileged of attending the World Premier of the film, along with cast, director and a producer, at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). The person I attended with told me that he had read the synopsis and was fearing a depressing film. Well he was wrong. This is a film you want to see and recommend. The characters are lovable. You want to have George Clooney's character on your speed dial labeled as "Best Friend". The children/teens, there are three, are talented actors and boost the quality of this production. It doesn't hurt that a film set in Hawaii is quite inviting. You don't always know where the story is going but after scenes are unraveled you are happy that they did present themselves. Rather then depressing, this film is uplifting. You realize that even problems so far from your home are the same all over. Go out, spend a few bucks, see the move, you'll be happy you did.Side note, after the TIFF presentation the director, Alexander Payne, George Clooney and the cast took the stage. It was not surprising that George was absolutely great with the young ones and the comedy continued on stage after the movie. This very quality was evident in George's character in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I went to see The Descendants, thinking it would be a comedy with some dramatic elements, along the lines of Sideways or Little Miss Sunshine. There is very little to laugh about in this film. It is essentially a soap opera about the travails of rich family in Hawaii. Most of the characters are dysfunctional and not particularly likable, including the children. There is little that is redemptive or worth celebrating or that we could even relate to.The acting is well done, particularly the young woman who plays the teenage daughter. Some of the scenic shots were nice. The soundtrack, which was mostly Hawaiian music (lots of slack key guitar) was great. In fact, the soundtrack was the thing we liked best about the film.If you want to see a well-made soap opera, then you will enjoy this film. If you want some humor and a bit more depth, you may be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I stumbled across this movie. I don't think it is a spoiler to say, pivotal to the story is a death which is dealt with in a realistic way.All throughout the movie the dramatic moments were dealt with softly, the writing and acting were subtle. The other aspect that I found realistic was the interior shots. The movie is set on Hawaii and the homes portrayed in the movie were different from the usual homes created for many movies. They seemed to reflect the place; they were furnished like homes you would find in Hawaii. Also the Hawaiian music track that was played frequently and this made another connection between the theme of ancestors and family's location. I found the unfolding of the individual's characteristics were unexpected. Many seem to begin predictably and then would show a surprising aspect. This was one of the strategies that let the story unfold in a very real and unexpected way. One thing missing for me was the lack of discourse around 'family' and its function. Family and the place it has in the present and the past was the lynch-pin for all of the story lines. While the link with land was included, it seemed to be portrayed without the depth that this connection would have had if these were real people.</fullReview>

It seems to me that if you have experienced end-of-life matters with a close family member, and saw this experience expose flaws in your personality and relationships, then this movie might make a lot more sense and hit you pretty hard. I guess the only weakness I will mention is the music was a little obtrusive at times.

It feels like it is the middle act in a 3 act play: when the movie begins, his wife is already in a coma from a recent boating accident, his siblings and cousins (the "descendants") are 18 years in to a 30 year land agreement and he is acting as executor over a huge financial decision, he is estranged from his older daughter for unknown reasons, and he is left to deal with finally being a father to his youngest daughter. Some of these are resolved but without any climactic closure, and the film ends with others unresolved. I have no issue with open endings in movies to a point, but this felt like there was already a lack of build up and then it was just over. The acting was exceptional and the story was relatable, the Hawaiian scenery was gorgeous, but it was lacking in the cinematic "oomph" I was expecting. 6/10, rewatchability 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "different" kind of movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In short, this isn't a date flick. It's pacing is extremely relaxed, almost a metaphor for the pace in which it occurs, in Hawaii, on the island of Kauai. But things aren't paradise for the characters in this movie, far from it.Clooney gives a competent and nuanced performance, with the highest marks going to the role of his eldest daughter, which was superbly realized.This film reminded me more of the films of the past, which didn't rely so much on sex and bombast, although this film definitely qualifies as a melodrama, after all, at it's core is death and dying. But I think it was the direction's personal vision not to play the typical Hollywood movie card, but instead let the entire drama play out naturally and easily, without undue drama or the typical film stereotypes employed to titillate more than anything else. It's an adult film, with adult topics, and probably of little interest to kids or teens. All in all, however, a very thoughtful and well played film, worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad but Missing Something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney was good in this. Finally he wasn't playing a stud. In fact he was an ineffectual loser. The characters are real people with flaws and redeeming qualities. Get rid of that stupid narration. It's such a cheap device.Using a coma as a device has been done too, like in the Sandra Bullock picture While You Were Sleeping. But I'll excuse that. My primary complaint about movies is lack of character development. In this one you never see the couple together, so you can only hear second hand what their marriage was like.You do get development for the Clooney guy, his older daughter and her boyfriend. The boyfriend was the most interesting and genuine of all. He's a seemingly dumb loser yet exhibits lots of patience and wisdom at times.What was missing was some sense of why this guy was such a loser and why the marriage was so shallow. Since he comes from Hawaiian land barons and has a large family infrastructure, why doesn't he have deeper values and more fortitude? I need more background.The bikini-clad wise-cracking spoiled daughter is a cliché that I could do without. At least if you're going to use it, let it be one over 18 with some meat on their bones. If the idea was to titillate, it didn't work.It could have been worse, and there were some good photographic frames of beach settings. The cliché Hawaiian ukulele music drove me crazy. This is one boring-arse film. So only watch it for Clooney's portrayal of a loser. He is good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney puts his heart on the line in this one, as a land baron who's forced to stop concentrating on his work when his wife suffers a critical accident, leaving her in a coma in the hospital. Therefore George must look after his two daughters, both who are going through various stages of adolescence.It's good to see someone normally as suave as Mr Clooney, looking pretty out of his depth with two young girls and he pulls it off well. Despite having plenty of adult themes running through it - death, adultery, family in-fighting - it's actually quite a nice film with a decent message about family values.It's not hilarious, but then it doesn't try to be. Just enjoy it for a gentle ride of good humour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely done but didn't really hit home for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the Oscars and other award shows so when The Descendants got all these accolades it peaked my interest but I never got around to watch the film. I now have, and let me tell you I was not particularly impressed, I didn't connect with the movie. But watching it I understood that people would easily connect with The Descendants. I mean, if you've been through or going through something similar this movie could really move you, and touch you like Still Alice did for me this year.So while part of me does not really understand why George Clooney scored an Oscar nomination for this - I'd have to check out who the other contenders were but I don't care that much - I have to admit that it is a decent film. It's simple, doesn't take itself too seriously, and a bit raw. The characters are easy to relate, in some way, they're kind of stripped down and feel like regular people going through some though times. Like I said, I couldn't really relate to the film because so far I've been lucky enough not to have lost anyone close to me. I know, I'm lucky I am and I do feel like I'll experience this movie very differently when I eventually go power through a big loss. Don't get me wrong, I'm not waiting for a tragedy to watch this movie again. All I'm saying is that The Descendants as everything to faithfully depict the aftermath of a tragedy, the frustration, the emotions, the humor, and the relief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Descendants is a rare movie. It takes a unique situation and puts people who are flawed and lost ,Right in the middle of it. George Clooney's Matt King is a businessman/Lawyer who was left a inheritance of a Large and highly valuable area of undeveloped land. This Area of land is left in a trust for the members of the family to decide on what happens to it. Matt King is wealthy as is the rest of the family. Yet The pressure is on to sell the land to a developer who will not only pay top dollar for it,But create businesses that will bring more money to Hawaii. Matt likes the idea of a Hawaiian Developer spending the money,It keeps Hawaiian money in Hawaii. During this high pressure situation Matt's Wife Elizabeth is injured in a speedboat accident. Matt's World is turned upside down and inside out. The Film opens as the Doctors are telling Matt that his wife will not awaken from the coma and is already in fact dead. Matt's lost he is as he claims the backup parent. The Understudy. He's got two daughters he doesn't really know. His youngest daughter is ten and already a handful. His oldest daughter is 17 and bent on self destruction. When Matt goes to his oldest daughter's school to get her he finds out that she is drunk. She's out of control angry and she's suffering from guilt. When she tells him his wife was cheating on him. His world not only spirals out of control. Matt is now determined to find out who it is she cheated on him with. But He's also determined to find out why. No matter how painful. The Rest of the film deals with truths. And Lies and the lies we tell ourselves and the truths we deny ourselves. In the end Matt and his daughters bond and become closer. George Clooney delivers maybe one of his finest performances ever. His hapless Matt King caught in a web of someone's lies and a web of greed as his family pushes for the big sale. Matt Resolves everything in a way that not only lets him keep his dignity. But he resolves everything in a way that he can hold his head up and Say I'm a Father and a honourable man. I loved this movie for it pacing and a stand out performance by just about everyone involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As we come up Oscar nomination season, I am only just getting around to the best of the last bash. I remember making a few attempts to see this at the time and have to say, it was my loss having to watch it on a small screen. Having loved Payne's last films (Sideways, About Schmitt, etc), I think he has made a small masterpiece with this one. Treats big themes in such a first person, personal way that you feel the full stretch of Clooney's emotional range almost to breaking point. Not to say the supporting cast - particularly his teenage daughters - are overshadowed. This is ensemble acting and direction at it's best. I read somewhere that the cinemas were filled with seniors in the States and it's easy to see why - its all about life, death and what we leave to our, cue title, descendants. Should have won more than it did, IMHO...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every so often a film comes around that stays with you long after the credits roll and lights come up. The Descendants is such a film. A woman is severely injured in a boating accident and her somewhat distant husband is left trying to figure things out. Writer director Alexander Payne, has written such a deep and profound story that it will draw you in without you even knowing it. George Clooney in the role that may be his best ever is a man who struggles to make sense of his life and the relationships that he has to begin to nurture is just brilliant here. Writer, director Alexander Payne takes long breaks in between his films, his last being the equally brilliant Sideways . The Descendants is at times heartbreaking and equally funny. It is a rare honest film that no one should miss. Every performer shines in this film from the smallest part to supporting cast. Veteran actor Robert foster in particular is heartbreaking as Clooney's father in law, torn with bitterness and extreme sadness at the pending death of his daughter. The musical score by several Hawaiian artist is just a perfect companion to this great film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and amusing family drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two big decisions that could forever affect your family's future are ahead of you. One of them already made, the other still being debated. Then you're hit with news you never saw coming and expected to deal with it quietly.Matt King (played by George Clooney) is lawyer in Hawaii and, by virtue of his profession, the sole executor a family trust that controls 25,000 acres of untouched land on Kauai that they will lose relatively soon thanks to the rule against perpetuities. In addition, he is married with two daughters and their mother has been in a coma for six months since a boating accident and the terms of her living will dictate that she will soon be disconnected from life-support. His younger daughter, Scottie (played by Amara Miller), is unaware and is holding out hope that her mother will wake up. His seventeen year-old daughter, Alex (played by Shailene Woodley), is away at a reform school, of sorts, and stills bears a great deal of resentment for her mother as a result of being sent away. She claims the motivation for that decision was her discovery of her mother's infidelity and says as much to her father. First rejecting the idea, Matt (Clooney) eventually accepts it and then decides to confront the other man in her life, bringing his daughters along under the pretense of a much needed respite.Hawaiian music isn't really my taste. Perhaps it's the tone, perhaps it's that I don't speak and could never learn the language. On the other hand, it does set the mood beautifully as do the many shots showcasing Hawaii's natural majesty. Clooney brings the conflict to life with a typically gripping performance and the cast all back him to varying degrees. I will say the part of Brian Speer, the man King (Clooney's) wife was having an affair with was not very well-acted by Matthew Lillard but it's a part with little screen time and few lines so it's forgivable. Buy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matt King(George Clooney)is a land baron, more or less managing inherited land in Hawaii. The land is precious, undeveloped and valuable family real estate that George is being pressured to sell. This distant father and husband has more pressing problems. His wife is killed in a boating accident and George must now try to repair a relationship with his two daughters, Alexandra and Scottie. Things between them are a little icy and the girls are a bit reluctant to open up to the now threesome of a family. George finds out from several people that his estranged wife had a boyfriend and this fact starts to consume him. Luckily the girls don't shy away from helping George find out this man's identity. This tale of legacy at times is unexpectedly comical. Also in the cast: Shallene Woodley, Amara Miller, Matthew Lillard, Patricia Hastie and Beau Bridges.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a calm and simple movie that doesn't try to be something more than what it is. George Clooney seems to do well with these types of role where his character has to deal with issues when it comes to people that surrounds him. And it doesn't have to be in a physical manner. What I liked about this movie is the execution of it all when it comes to Matt King(George Clooney) dealing with a wife that is in coma after cheating on him and his daughters. And lastly the family inheritance and what he is going to do with it and if money is everything in life. There isn't much character development but it does enough for the direction this film tries to go. I liked how some of the characters that starts off not likable become a bit likable or understandable as the movie progresses. It isn't done in a well developed fashion but it's good enough. This isn't a movie to watch with the family since most kids might get bored to tears and some teens might find this boring. Since it's contrived of mostly family issues without any action. It might not be one of the best simple movies I seen or one of the most memorable one but it's worth seeing at least once. Although I doubt I will be seeing it again.6/10</fullReview>

This movie took me right back to my Mom on her death bed, which is exactly what I was trying not to think about. Thanks for that.This also happened a few years back. My Mom had just died, and my boyfriend at the time's Mother had just been diagnosed with terminal cancer. We rented the Diane Keaton movie "The Family Stone" which was also billed as a comedy. The mother dies of terminal cancer, just what we were not wanting to think about.Promoters need to consider that many people rent a comedy to forget about their troubles, not to have it rubbed in their faces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Descendants Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a reason why this film was nominated so many times for the Academy Awards. Simply put, this film is absolutely brilliant. The story of Matt King is a fascinating one to say the least. His wife goes into a coma due to a boating accident and is told that there is no sign of her ever coming out of it. To add on to that he finds out that his wife has been cheating on him because of how rocky their marriage has been recently. This movie is great because its setting is in Hawaii and the cinematography used to convey the everyday life of an islander is a really interesting perspective. The reason I really loved this movie was because while it is serious drama about Matt King and the problems he goes through (trying to figure out who the other man is, dealing with his two daughters, and the death of his wife) there is a lot of hilarious comedic relief that George Clooney and the supporting cast provide. You feel like you should be sad watching this movie, and even at the most sad dramatic parts you find yourself hysterically laughing. For example, when he tells his oldest daughter that her mom is going to die he tells her while she is swimming in the pool. It was clearly the wrong time and place to tell her about something so traumatic yet there is something so awkwardly funny about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Payne does it again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne is definitely one of the best filmmakers walking the earth today. Though he doesn't make the kind of films that pack multi-plexes with screaming children and distracted parents, he gives true movie buffs something hard to find these days. His films are often complex character studies with interesting casting choices. I'd venture a guess that Payne allows some scenes to play out in which ever direction the actors take them. That type of film may rarely lead to box office success, but its good that someone keeps financing his projects, and that good actors are willing to participate.The Descendants is a complex starring George Clooney and the islands of Hawai'i. Clooney plays a lawyer with a lot going on in his life. His wife has just been seriously injured in a boating accident. She is in a deep coma we learn early on that she will not recover from. The couple's living will states that in this case, the plug must be pulled in such a circumstance. The loss of his wife means that Clooney will have to re-connect more strongly than ever with his two daughters when they have always been much closer with their mother. Clooney is also the trustee of several thousand acres of pristine Hawai'ian coast land which his relatives want him to sell, as they will also reap millions of dollars if he does. Things are further complicated as Clooney learns from his eldest daughter that his wife had been having a serious affair with a real estate broker who also could make a fortune if this land sale goes through. Since the wife's fate is already decided, Clooney and his daughters spend the majority of the film attempting to find and confront the man she was having the affair with. This leads to several unpredictable scenes and lots of different emotions from the different characters.The Descendants is quite a richly rewarding experience. As always, Payne has made some interesting casting choices beyond Clooney who is as good as ever. Where had Robert Forster been hiding all these years? I had to look him up from the movie The Black Hole just to remember what his name was! And Beau Bridges is a welcome sight. It would be nice if Jeff's recent success would lead to more from Beau. I'd never heard of Shailene Woodley before, but I suspect we will hear plenty more from her in the future. The land of Hawai'i also plays a major role. Payne doesn't always film it in the way one would expect to see it. Instead of excessive glamor shots of white sandy beaches rimmed with blue water, Payne more often than not goes for the more subtle shots of the islands' beauty. And he definitely scores points for showing some of the unique aspects of the behaviors of local residents. This is not a film about how tourists behave or where they hang out on vacation. This is another fine film from Payne. Definitely looking forward to his next one. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

I'm sure it differentiates a bit from man to man, but for me the great movies are not only the ones that feature talented casts, nice storytelling, and solid scripts but are also the ones that manage to affect a wide range of your emotions. The Descendants does all of that and then some. Every performance feels superb and the never-ending downward spiral feeling the story gives you is resolved in a way that not only feels natural but is completely satisfying. This is George Clooney at his best and have to say that Alexander Payne has done outstanding. It's quite possibly the most powerful and emotion-evoking film of the year.

		<shortDescription>Great script, wonderful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once in a while it feels good to watch a good movie. Sometimes it's a relief not having to hear gunshots, loud soundtrack and explosions. Sometimes the explosions happen in the dialogue of a movie and it's so subtle, it becomes the essence of a movie. SPOILER ALERT: That's the case with The Descendants starring George Clooney as a Hawaiian man that discovers that his wife is in a coma after a high speed boat accident, leaving him in charge of their two daughters. At first he doesn't know what to do, it's as if he had been an outsider to the whole "parent" thing and he's been so consumed by work that he never thought that this may actually happen one day. He had left the parenting thing to his wife and he was now faced with the reality that he was in charge of raising his daughters in the event that his wife may or may not wake up from her comma state. You think is as simple as it sounds? Well, if you've ever been married with one teenage daughter who's a foulmouthed and disobedient, another 9 year old going on 19 and your comatose wife may or may not have been cheating on you then you would know what a life changing event that is. That's where the wonderful script comes into play. As far as the title is concern, I believe that the story is also about the bond that we as humans should have with both our ancestors and our descendants. Many of us are disconnected from our ancestors and vice versa. There's either little or no communication at all and no values are transferred from one generation to the next. In this society that we live in it's crucial to have moral values and that our life has mattered somehow, that we did the best we could to raise our kids. Just because you're older than your children this shouldn't devalue their worth and their individuality. Throughout The Descendants, Matt King (Clooney) learns quite a lot from his teenage daughter Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) that he never knew that he could, just like she learned from him as well. Together they form a bond that they may never have had if circumstances hadn't changed so drastically.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved Shailene Woodley and George Clooney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be the first to admit that after seeing a few episodes of The Secret Life of the American Teenager I wasn't quite sure about all of the praise Shailene Woodley was getting for The Descendants. Nothing against her, really. I just see the show as incredibly melodramatic (maybe I haven't seen enough) and not of the same caliber as what they were talking about with The Descendants.After seeing The Descendants, though, I can say that regardless of what I think about Woodley in Secret Life, she's amazing in the film. Pretty much everyone is, actually.The Descendants, stars George Clooney as Matt King a Hawaiian lawyer - and land owner - who's wife is in a coma and on life support after a boating accident. It takes his teenage daughter, Alexandra (played by Woodley) to bring to his attention that his wife was having an affair.Alexandra, the troubled older daughter, has been away at boarding school, but King doesn't seem to know much more about his ten-year-old daughter Scottie's life, either. As he attempts to repair his relationship with his daughters, he also has to cope with the possibility that his wife may not wake up from her coma.All of that sounds dark and hard to deal with, but The Descendants is incredibly funny. And not inappropriately so, either. It's brilliant in dealing with this flawed (almost, at times, non-existent) parental relationship Clooney's character has with his daughters.What's also fantastic is that George Clooney looks tired and a little worn out. Right? Who would ever think George Clooney looking tired would be a good thing but it is. He doesn't have his classic, handsome, movie star look throughout this movie and it's what's needed for this character. He's a guy trying to deal with his two daughters (that he does not know how to deal with) and figure out what's happening with his dying wife. He does not need to look rested and refreshed.The Descendants is based on the novel of the same name by Kaui Hart Hemmings and while I wasn't sure about wanting to read the book before I saw the movie, I very much do now. (Something that very, very rarely happens.)This is a movie I absolutely recommend!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Descendants ? CATCH IT (A) I never thought that walking into "The Descendants" that I would laugh my *** Off. I have always thought The Descendants to be about a dysfunctional family dealing with accident in the family. It surely surpasses all my expectations with such a real and delightful script. Alexander Payne has written beautiful story and above all choose a perfect cast for it. Who George Clooney will rock the Hawaiian look? George Clooney has done a tremendous job as an actor, he may have lost the Oscar but surly has won again millions of hearts. Shailene Woodley is simply amazing; there are rarely performances in Hollywood where an actor shows such emotional turmoil on screen. Shailene Woodley may lose the Oscar nod but she surly has the potential to win Oscar one day. Nick Krause Aka. Sid has some of the most hilarious moments in the movie, he is super awkward and funny in a weird way... TRUST ME I did not see that coming. It's simply Superb. Now the two huge surprise castings were Matthew Lillard (Known as Stuart the Creepy Voice Killer on Scream &amp; Shaggy in Scooby-Doo) and Judy Greer (BFF of every other Rom-Com heroine). Though I would have chosen a better guy than Matthew Lillard because of his enormous popularity as killer but still he did a decent job. But Judy Greer is a pleasant surprise; I have never seen her like this emotional and brilliant. Overall, The Descendants is a great movie, which deserves all its accolades. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Clooney raises the bar with "The Descendants"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have ever had the privilege of watching a world class musician play while at the top of their craft you know it can be a moving and at times emotional experience. When a great blues guitarist plays, there's a reason they say they are making the guitar cry, and that's because if they do their job well enough they have the ability to move the listener to tears. Their are rare occasions when actors can do the same thing evoking the same emotions out of the viewer.George Clooney's latest film, The Descendants without question shows how an actor has the ability to pull emotion from them self and from the audience viewer. Clooney's work in this film is one of the best performances in years that features dialogue delivery and facial expressions combined for one of the most heartfelt and gut wrenching performances. Clooney has clearly set a new high for himself and a new standard in the drama/comedy world.Clooney plays Matt King a successful real estate attorney who's world is turned upside down when his wife has an accident and is in a fatal coma. King soon discovers that his wife had been cheating on him and had planned to divorce him. He is left to rediscover his two daughters and learn along the way how to begin to be a real father to them while trying to do right by them and his native homeland of Hawaii as a trust to the single largest private land owner in the state. The performance Clooney turns in is completely flawless as he runs the gamut of all feelings. He proves to be not only one of the most respected persons in Hollywood but now, quite possibly it's premiere working actor.Specifically the scene when Matt learns about his wife's infidelity from his oldest daughter, you can see every thought in Matt's head play out on his face with complete disbelief. He then quickly runs in an awkward and nervous way, to his sister in-laws and then confronts her wanting to know the details of the affair he begins to let himself feel and let out, ever so slightly the pain his is just beginning to feel and discover.Alexander Payne has a unique way of blending the serious and emotional with the comedic side that unavoidably comes with those times and situations. While one moment you are laughing at Clooney's terrible stalking abilities you are then angry and on the verge of tears as he confront's her wife's unsuspecting lover.Not lost amidst Clooney's fine performance is the acting of the rest of the superb cast from the two daughters to Matt's father in-law played but the always underrated Robert Forrester and even the oldest daughter's confidant and friend Sid who ultimately becomes a key role in Clooney's acceptance.Payne perfectly weaves the different levels of the completely new life Matt has discovered. He let's you in the mind as he continues to peel the layers away and starts his new life. He shows how King learns fatherhood along the way much later in life than he ever expected to or hoped to.The Descendants wasn't the most unique film of the year, unlike The Artist, but it was undoubtedly the most true to life and most perfectly made movie of the year. It will no doubt gain in appreciation and following as time goes on. It is the one can't and shouldn't miss film of the year. www.loveyourmovies.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this mainly to see if George Clooney was truly deserving of the best actor nomination. I'm a fan of his but he usually always plays the same kind of characters, a flawed and/or ruthless person who has an experience and realises the error of his ways. And this is no different.George Clooney plays Matt King who along with his family owns a large piece of land on a Hawaiian island. His wife is in a boating accident and is left in a coma. Matt has to put his professional life on hold to take care of his two daughters. He also discovers his wife was seeing another man and wanted to leave him.This is a good film with every cast member, Shailene Woodley, Amara Miller, Beau Bridges, Matthew Lillard and Judy Greer, doing an excellent job. But it is the performance of Nick Krause as Sid who steals the scene every time he speaks. He adds a needed element of comedy in an otherwise serious film.So does George Clooney's performance deserve the Oscar nomination and the Golden Globe win? Having not yet watched all the nominated films I can't say. But he is great in this film. He is better than usual showing more emotion and vulnerability than he normally does. But it is the cast as a whole that makes this film work so well. Even though he is in pretty much every scene and it is his story, the cast brings this film to life and helps give his character added dimension.The film itself is one of those that doesn't really go anywhere. It tells the story that takes place over a few days well. There is no need for character development and no one really learns a life lesson. But the story is good and the characters realistic and interesting.This is a good film and I enjoyed watching it. It's a good movie for a quiet afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another lovely, rich masterpiece from director Alexander Payne.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne is a cinematic God. Though I can't say he's underrated, because he's won two Oscars, I can say that every film of his that I have seen was fantastic. He's a director that sticks to a certain kind of humor in each and every film; his films are hilarious character studies about real people doing things that push them over the edge.His past works have included Citizen Ruth, which I can't wait to see, Election, a comic masterpiece, About Schmidt, a rich, powerful, and lovely film, while being hilarious, and the same goes for Sideways, which he went home with an Oscar for.His other films were sort of a warm-up in preparation for his latest film, The Descendants, and that's saying a lot considering his resume. The Descendants is more serious than his other works, but yet it still stays in the Payne-ian spirit of real comedy.The film revolves around a Hawaiian land barron named Matt King (played by George Clooney), who's life is turned upside down when his wife falls into a coma. This forces him to reconnect with his daughters, Scottie and Alex(Shailene Woodley). Just as Matt is starting to understand things, he quickly loses that understand when he realizes that his wife was having an affair. So, while struggling with his vegetable of a wife, his kids, and his job, Matt and Alex soon pursue his wife's other man, which brings the family closer.The rest of the cast includes Beau Bridges as Matt's cousin; Robert Forester as Matt's grouchy father-in-law; Matthew Lillard as Brian, a real estate agent, and Judy Greer as his somewhat clueless wife. Every single cast member of The Descendants is marvelous. from Clooney, to Woodley, to Lillard, to Greer, and Nick Krause, who plays Alex's hippie friend.There are plenty of awkwardly hilarious moments here, mainly from Krause. But even with all of it's laughs, The Descendants is a powerful film. Clooney's performance is the best I have seen all year. He plays such a rich, funny, and sad man who you really can't help but root and sympathize for. Clooney is really wonderful here, and so is everyone else.The Descendants is lovely. It's extremely entertaining. A wonderful, warm, funny, and beautiful story about family and the things that bring them together. Up until today, Hugo was the years best film. But I think that,now, after seeing The Descendants, my vote has got to change. See it, otherwise you'll have a hard time believing it.A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the story is worth telling (from a book by Kaui Hart Hemmings) and the study of contemporary family life with all its flaws is commendable, and yes, George Clooney submerges himself in a role that is anything but his usual romance hero roles, but it seems that the ideas presented could have been condensed into an hour long movie for television instead of spread over 2 hours of interminable Hawaiian music backed vistas of the islands. The film appeals to a lot of people and that is satisfying to note that movie goers care enough about end of life issues and flawed parenting skills to support the ideas buried in this extravaganza.Matt King (George Clooney though looking unkempt and sloppy is solid in a an introspective and subdued performance) is a real estate attorney who happens to be the controlling descendant in a family whose ancestors date back to the days of Hawaiian kings: the family owns a large parcel of land they plan to sell to become instantly wealthy, a move the Hawaiians find disturbing as the influx of commercialism would destroy the native beauty of their island. Matt's wife Elizabeth is critically injured in a boating accident and is in a coma, not only affecting Matt emotionally but also pointing up the fact that he must assume full parental duties in coping with his two rather outrageous daughters - Alexandra (Shailene Woodley in a career making brilliant role) and chubby troublesome Scottie (Amara Miller). He brings Alex home from the boarding school she has been attending in an attempt to make her less sociopathic (she has fought seriously with her mother, drinks to excess and behaves badly) but she come with her loopy friend Sid (Nick Krause, another fine performance) who ends up being not unlike Matt. Alex tells Matt the Elizabeth was having an affair, a note that shocks Matt and sets him on a quest to discover who gained his wife's attention. When he discovers the boyfriend was a married real estate broker Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard) whose wife Julie (Judy Greer) Matt meets on the beach the attempt to bring closure to this portion of Matt's life, as Elizabeth is taken off life support machines, opens windows of communication between Matt and his daughters, with Sid who isn't as loopy as Matt perceived, with Elizabeth's parents (Robert Forster and Barbara L. Southern who embodies Alzheimer's Disease well), and most of all with himself. He gains courage to respect his heritage of Hawaiian land, dismisses his family's greed (from which Brian Speer would have benefited), and becomes an enlightened and emotionally more mature man.THE DESCENDANTS is a worthy film with a few good performances and a star turn for Clooney and Woodley, but oh, turn off that interminable Hawaiian music that drowns the story like a tsunami!

		<shortDescription>Part drama, part comedy but not plenty of either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants follows the modern day trials of a progeny of Hawaiian aristocracy. Matt King, portrayed by George Clooney, although has been married for several years and has two daughters, has just been forced into the reality of fatherhood.The story begins with Mrs King boating accident where she is left in a vegetative state in hospital fighting for her life whilst Matt has for the first time assumed responsibility for both the household and the daughters; naturally he has not got a clue of how to be a father as opposed to having adjusted to life as an absent/back-up father.To add insult to injury, the frustrated husband finds out that his bedridden wife was also unfaithful to him and thus causing a whirlwind of emotions, thoughts as well as some travelling since the double-bereaved husband decides to find his wife's lover and let him know of her condition.Alexander Payne does a fine job in engaging the audience into the story and one will quickly feel being part of it, although it sets off with a rather long narrative as if George Clooney were reading to us from the book. The performances are very convincing, though there is no greatness and with regards to George Clooney's performance it is hard to tell whether he credibly plays the father who just discovered parenthood and he is out of his depth, or simply Clooney himself were out of his depth with this role. Matt King's daughter (Shailene Woodley) is brilliant as the rebellious teenager turned supportive daughter and same goes to her boyfriend Sid (Nick Krause) as the oddball with plenty of allure.One thing that made this film stand out is how in the beginning the father ? daughters relationship is pretty much that of strangers and in the process ? in the presence of several ups and downs ? they finally broke those barriers in a journey that involved anger, regret, sharing grief with others some of whom were unable to empathise. As in real life, a family tragedy can bring people closer or permanently tear them apart.The book skilfully manages to exhume humour out of a tragic situation whilst the film though conveys that spirit and having been being classified as drama &amp; comedy is not enough of either; in spite of this there are some comic and moving scenes. The intertwine of drama and comedy was much stronger in "About Schmidt", but then again George Clooney is no Jack Nicholson.Overall it is a moving and appealing film on the matter of human sentiments that is kept well together by the combination of its vibrant characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant watch with a touching story ........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants is a feel good emotional dramedy with a touch of Alexander Payne's brilliant direction and award winning performance by George Clooney. Matt (George Clooney) is a regular guy who is a trustee of thousand acres of untouched land in the island of Kaua'i, Hawaii. He learns about his wife's boat accident and soon reaches hospital only to realize that she would be permanently in coma and may survive for few days. He goes into depression trying to re-unite with his estranged daughter, Alexendra(Shailene Woodley) and 10 year old daughter , Scottie who are difficult to handle as Matt couldn't spent much time with his kids. Through Alexandra , he discovers that his wife was cheating on him. To know the person with whom his wife was having an affair, he goes to Kaua'I to find the person and confront him before she dies. Alexander Payne , director of SIDEWAYS , crafts a very beautiful , engaging film which will make you feel good once you are out of theater. The film based on a novel written by Kaui Hart Hemmings puts the protagonist in dilemma with monumental tasks to tackle and the way he handles it one by another only to realize that you should only do what your heart says. George Clooney , already won Golden Globe for his brilliant acting , sheds his glamorous avatar only to become an everyday man who deals with family life crisis. Clooney shows his emotional expressions with ease and comes out with a towering performance . He is just getting mature with each role. Performance by rest of the star cast is efficient coupled by a tight screenplay. Cinematography is outstanding capturing the beautiful locales of Hawaii. Background score is perfect that gels with the film.Overall , a very well made laid back film that you are sure going enjoy. Watch it if you like performance oriented films with tight script. Brilliant ? 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple, understated delight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Oscar buzz was the primary reason that made me excited to see this film, but the fact that Alexander Payne who had made the brilliant "About Schmidt" had directed it made me even more eager to see it. And was I impressed."The Descendants" is a simple film, telling a simple story of a father trying to deal with way too much and all at the same time. We all face situations in real life when we need to confront our emotions no matter how much we chose to ignore it. What do we do then? This is where the soul of the film belongs. Clooney does a fantastic job as Matt King, a father, torn apart by the plethora of emotions that surround him. He is so wonderfully understated that you don't even feel that he is acting. He totally deserves all the accolades he is currently receiving. Among the supporting cast, Shailene Woodley is a revelation. Its a difficult character to play and she is stunning in it.Overall, "The Descendants" tugs at your heartstrings, minus cheap frills and melodrama. As for Payne, he doesn't really bring anything new here. He has done full justice to this genre before (Sideways, About Schmidt). Maybe he should try something new now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clooney and co. bring the quality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If actors were pieces of meat, George Clooney would be some sort of pricey premium cut. If actors were drinks, he would be the kind of finely aged scotch you've seen mature so perfectly it almost seems a crime to open it. If actors wer- the point is, the man seems to have developed a talent for picking his spots every Oscar season, often appearing in highly emotional, purpose-driven fare personally customised to earn him at least a nomination for Best Actor. This year is no different, as Clooney appears in not one, but two critically appraised films, and it is his efforts, along with an excellent supporting cast and magnetic script, that put The Descendants in prime position to take out the year's top prize. The title refers to Matt King (Clooney) and his daughters Alex (Shailene Woodley) and Scottie (Amara Miller). The extended King family are the descendants of affluent Hawaiians, and so continue to own their ancestor's many miles of untouched, pristine land. With Matt being promoted to primary stakeholder, he now holds the majority vote in the decision to sell this land. Important, yes, but this pales in comparison to the other big deal in Matt's life: a pair of unruly daughters, a wife whom he discovers has been cheating on him, and a boating accident that has placed said wife in an indefinite coma.With each passing year, it becomes more difficult to distinguish between good, honest films released over the holiday period, and those simply pining for an award or two. Certainly, this film has many typical elements of an Oscar-baiter: an intimate setting, an emphasis on interpersonal relationships and a protagonist at a crossroads in life. Very little of the synopsis is truly original, but the film draws its appeal from just how the story is told. On top of delivering a powerhouse performance, Clooney is present in virtually every scene which, coupled with the sporadic use of voice-over narration, gives the audience an intricate insight into the mentally-crippling decisions one man is forced to make in an attempt to keep his family together.The film starts off simply enough, but becomes more emotionally complex with each scene. The audience is introduced to Matt, we learn of his wife, we learn of the wife's indiscretions, whom she had an affair with and why this man is of more significance to the story than first thought. For almost two hours, The Descendants progressively builds to a climax that is altogether well rounded, conclusive and memorable, like some sort of grand operatic piece. Or Stairway to Heaven, whatever. Of course, this couldn't be a Best Picture nominee without some underlying themes to accompany the plot. The film deals a lot with life decisions. That is, which one is the right one, and how the most obvious or most favoured option may not always be best. But, in some sort of strange, complimentary fashion, the most surprising aspect of this movie is how plain funny it is. To be clear, The Descendants has no intention of being classified as a comedy, but its unique infusion of 'grown-up' storytelling and often very politically incorrect humour adds depth in the pure entertainment department, particularly for those who may be deterred into thinking this film is just another sob story.If an ambition to be bold is the film's main event, then its efforts to avoid predictability as the plot thickens is its equally strong undercard. As Matt and family take a trip out to the islands so he can show his kids exactly how much of the land is theirs, one daughter recalls how she used to camp out on one particular stretch of beach with her mother when she was younger. This sounds like a certain case of foreshadowing, but Matt knows that, given the events unfolding around them, one camping trip will not solve much. This is but one example of the maturity and monk-like dedication to persistently engaging the audience, making The Descendants a must-see anytime before Oscar night.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent. Mr Clooney is exceptional.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not one of these people who is hopelessly in love with George Clooney, but after this film I finally see what people see in him, he has this ease on screen, his performances are so effortless that he just eases through each scene so flawlessly that it's hard not to be taken in by his charm and charisma. Anyway, The Descendants is a terrific film with wonderful performances, a great family drama storyline and a setting that will inspire your next holiday, the family dynamic between Mr Clooney and his two young daughters is unlike any I've ever seen in screen before, he seems like a dad who is close but far away from his daughters, some scenes are awkward and then others are really touching, and for someone like clooney who has a reputation for being an eternal bachelor, playing a father and having great chemistry with two young actresses is fantastic.The lush landscapes of of Hawaii are a dream for some people and the for others it's just home, and the way this is told through the story was something I really enjoyed. A lot should be said about the young Shailene Woodley, a wonderful new actress to emerge in the film industry, I have seen her in Secret Life of the American Teen and she is impressive in that too but she is a standout in The Descendants, she us just as much part of this movie as Clooney and for a young actress to hold her own next to a distinguished actor is great, I look forward to seeing her in lots more.This movie really just has it all, it's funny, it's heartwarming, heart wrenching, it's just an all round pleasure to watch. Clooney for the Oscar I say. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many films show us characters working their way through grief. In "The Descendants" Matt King (George Clooney) has to tell his family and friends that his wife Elizabeth will be taken off life support after suffering a head injury. His eldest daughter tells him that her mother has been having an affair, he learns that she was in love with the man, Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard) and was going to seek a divorce. After breaking the news to loved ones that those who loved Elizabeth should visit her to say goodbye, he decides to find Brian and allow him to see Elizabeth.Alexander Payne's direction and George Clooney's understated performance anchors this film from becoming a study in familial dysfunction and morose introspection. There is anger and disappointment, from all, but it is conveyed realistically without hysterics and punches, as when Elizabeth's father (Robert Forester) blames Matt for his daughter's accident, or when Matt's daughters realize their mother is going to die, or Matt confronts Brian or says goodbye to Elizabeth, it is very grounded in reality. I never felt I was watching someone act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The greatness of the movie, let alone the greatness of George Clooney's' acting is extremely hard for me to zero in on as I experienced the wonders of THE DESCENDANTS. Of course with time I realized that my expectations were set so high by its 2 wins at last week's Golden Globes that I was expecting a perfect 10. I have never seen nor rated a movie personally a perfect 10 and I am still clueless as to why expected a perfect 10. This is what I did next. I shut the movie off and went to bed and sat down to watch it first thing in the morning with a fresh mind and without any expectations as all.The star Clooney is not a star today. This is the most vulnerable I have seen him and also it's the first time I am seeing him out of a suit. I have seen Clooney run in THE American and I am watching him run in THE DESCENDANTS and that's when it's struck he actually acted a run! Had this been played by someone else, I am not certain if the award for best actor would have been bagged in this motion picture. After all who ever starred instead of George Clooney would go head on with the Driver aka Ryan Gosling for the award!Moving on, this vulnerable Honolulu attorney aka Matt King ( George Clooney) who has been neglecting his wife over the past 6 months sits by her death bed as she spends her time fitted onto a life preserving contraption and in a coma following a motor boat accident. Matt who has 2 daughters; Scottie ( Amara Miller) aged 10 and Alex ( Shailene Woodley) aged 17 has no idea as to how to function as a parent since Elizabeth ( Patricia Hastle) his wife took on the burden of raising the children almost on her own. Matt admits in a narrative that he is the backup parent, the understudy. Alexander Payne directs THE DESCENDANTS with a deep understanding of the idea of disturbance. When Matt's wife gets into a coma he doesn't allow Matt to just focus on one aspect, instead he makes Scottie the naughtiest possible 10 year old to father and he brings the 17 year old Alex as an abuser of drugs, alcohol and boys. How can one man handle all this at the same time and not breakdown in despair? When Matt falls down on his knees on his own driveway and lifts his head back up at the camera is when for the first time I was certain that Clooney indeed deserved to be awarded best actor at the globes.If you think that this is all that comes along Matt's way, it most certainly isn't. Matt King is a descendant of royal Hawaiian blood. His great great grandmother was a Hawaiian princess who married a banker and along with that passed on an inheritance of 25,000 acres of land on Kauai Island. Matt as the primary beneficiary has to make a choice if he is to preserve this great inheritance or sell it to a greedy bunch of developers breathing down his back in order to build the next resort in Hawaii. To add the final pinch of salt to this already well brewed soup of events is the final surprise that his daughter Alex breaks out to him.THE DESCENDANTS is a movie that will play along close to your heart and make you feel for the King family during the time of turmoil as they fight the world and the hardships of losing a loved one. Many would call this a must watch, instead I would prefer to call this a sad to be missed motion picture.Title: THE DESCENDANTS Directed by: Alexander Payne Starring: George Clooney, Shailene Woodley, Amara Miller, Nick Krause and Patricia Hastle.

		<shortDescription>Worthy of the nominations, but not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The much hyped and eagerly awaited film release of one of this years' main award title contenders will always divide opinion based on its critical and public receptions. Here is a film that will most likely be enjoyed and celebrated by critics, those close to the industry and avid movie goers and perhaps less so by the general public as this film lack that easy to digest nature and offers little in the form of easy gratification....Full review - read more: The timely release of the latest and much anticipated Alexander Payne offering has lead the film to numerous nominations on both sides of the Atlantic. From best picture, best direction and leading actor the nominations point this film on a high flying trajectory.The film from the outset develops a complex and emotionally gruelling story line of a severely injured mother, dysfunctional daughters, and an emotional distant, incapable father. The journey of the family's struggle to come to terms with their situation as well as deal with an historic land sale and embattled extended family subplots delves between the crushing blows of realisation, (beautifully executed examples by Shailene Woodley and Beau Bridges) and moments of hilarity (Clooney, Bridges and Nick Krause) that will turn in an instant keeping the emotional journey of the characters at the for front of the audiences experience.Similar to Paynes other work, this bitter sweet combination of tragedy and comedy drives the narrative and allows the characters to slowly reveal their motivations and build the body of understanding and circumstance to the films events. The tightrope that us as the viewer tread between these two camps are also beautifully displayed in the shot construction, bouncing between the confined and bland surroundings of the hospital room and the grand majestic pans and establishing shots of the family's' land plot. There are numerous stunning shots that will echo the 'paradise lost' theme as the characters travel islands of Hawaii, adding the analogy that the family and every member were similar to the archipelago - part of one but forever separate and alone.The stirring performance by Clooney, taking a step outside his usual area of comfort, is the perfect embodiment of a man far out his depth and ill-equipped to deal with the lesson life is about to teach him let alone prepare and shepherd his family through it. He is masterful in his achievement and without this backbone of a performance we would be greeting a very different film.The film is an enjoyable and emotion watch, it will lead to a triumph of independent cinema, to challenge the audience's current view or expectation of themselves. But its only failing would be of its overall appeal to a larger, mainstream audience.Lacking the prosaic and obtuse comedy elements that sit so well with the main studios as well as the grand feel good moment to round off the film and have everyone leave happy. It could also be argued that the film lacks the gravity or force to really challenge the audience. It does convey mixed messages and the overall conclusion or message of the story is open to interpretation.The film is cleverer and less apologetic to such nuances of Hollywood convention but steers close enough to attract the attention and gaze of many of its flock. The film is well worth a watch and is a worthy award contender on this year's award circuit but may have been overawed by some areas of the critical community.7/10 The_Frase</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>heartwarming without being sappy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've watched Payne's About Schimdt, Sideways and Election, you wouldn't think he would be capable of doing a movie such as this. He seems to do mostly dark comedies which explores the darkness that's within us. After watching the trailer, I didn't really expect this film would be a complete departure from the three films I've mentioned. I loved "Election" so much, thought "About Schimdt" was okay and hated "Sideways" so much. So I really had very low expectations going into the movie but I must say I was so wrong.The Descendants just sneaked up on me and completely made me fall in love with it. The story is so much prone to being sappy but the screenplay was handled very much with care and Payne's conscious direction made it a heartwarming family drama.Matt King seems to have it all. He is a descendant of one of the Hawaii royal family. He has the money, a lovely family and an established practice. It took one accident to pull him out of the "zen" that he's used to. Then he had to face the real state that his life is in. He has two daughters he really doesn't know. A wife he had neglected. and a family legacy that he's very much willing to give away to make the whole clan happy.Matt King's journey to the way that he has lived his life was painful as it is breathtaking. It actually provokes you to think and reflect how we can sometimes easily lash out in anger and retreat to depression and resentment without acknowledging our own faults. Matt King comes full circle with a full understanding and accountability of how wrong he was all along leading him to letting go of all anger and to just take stock and just make a conscious decision to change the course of his life. I applaud the ending so much because it didn't try to be preach-y. It didn't try to be self-righteous. There was only redemption. We see Matt King going back to his roots with a renewed sense of accountability to those who came before him and to his family: his two daughters.George Clooney played Matt King to a perfect note. Every breath and every move actually evokes a strong emotion that's building and being restrained at the same time. He was the heart of the movie and he was able to carry it very well. Shailene Woodley and Judy Greer were also stand outs.The Descendants, in my opinion, will go down in movie history as one of the best family dramas --- it was honest, real, relatable and intelligent. For this, I must say I was wrong about Alexander Payne.</fullReview>

The circumstances in this movie couldn't have been more "imaginary". to the point of ridiculous!

It was a great exercise for all concerned and the ultimate "hustle" for the audience. I was totally taken in by by it. I walked from the theater thinking I had just seen a very cool movie BUT, now that I am reflecting on it the story was so ludicrous and ridiculous, I can see why FOX released it under its "Searchlight" banner.

		<fullReview>It's understandable why this topically relevant movie that probes the emotional and mental difficulties of death and infidelity captures critical and popular acclaim. There are scenes and dialogue that appear to be difficult or emotional shockingly hard to bear and is bold enough to present American audiences with such harshness.Unfortunately, a closely, theatrical look at the movie reveals a number of weaknesses in its execution. There is a voice-over at the beginning which really seems to talk down to the audience, using narrative more appropriate for elementary school age children and which isn't used at the end of the movie which speaks for itself, unlike the narrative used in flashback form and at the end in Stand By Me (1986). The editing of the movie also seems to leave out important visual and acting behavioral scenes that would complete an vital emotional or intellectual point and thus the character development seems incomplete...the audience doesn't get an opportunity to develop sufficient rapport in the movie and the relatively quick set up seems to be fairly predictable and standard. The inclusion of so many archetype personalities, including a grandmother who has some mental issues, seems to be over-kill and in the end the inclusion of a boyfriend and even a younger sister/daugther seems to only dilute the film's ability to focus on the depth and qualitative full performances of George Clooney and his older daughter in the movie. Unlike the more raw and emotional riveting scenes and performance as found in Margot at the Wedding (2007), The Lovely Bones (2009), or The Ice Storm (1997) which would have possibly enwrapped the emotional intensity in a more powerful theatrical setting, Descendents instead attempts to provide a more polished and structured family drama as found other movies that are better scripted and stylized American Beauty (2000), The Pursuit of Happiness (2006), and Georgia Rule (2007). Descendents also spends an inordinate amount of screen time using a more immersive, photographic, or atmospheric design approach that also doesn't quite fit the narrative and subject matter as in this year's The Tree of Life (2011) or Lost in Translation (2003).Other family drama or relational dramas that had more emotional presence include Whale Rider (2002), Little Miss Sunshine (2006), even George Clooney's Up In The Air (2009), The Joy Luck Club (1993).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>over-hyped - but what isn't?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Descendants" is tame compared to Alexander Payne's recent directorial efforts. Again, he is showcasing average people squirming under the pressure of socially demanding situations. This time it's the photogenic and charismatic George Clooney as a Hawaiian lawyer (and hereditary landowner) adjusting messily to the hospitalization of his wife after a boating accident. Complicating matters are his out-of-control teen and tween daughters and the revelation that his now-comatose wife had been having an affair at the time of her mishap. Clooney is another flawed 21st century Everyman, previously played in Payne's films by Jack Nicholson in "About Schmidt" and Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church in "Sideways."For every scene that pops with originality there is one that drags like a well rehearsed "quirky" television drama. The pace is slow. The audience frequently sighs, waiting for the next bit of forced oddness. But there are also wonderful scenes like Clooney's intricately prepared confrontation with his main nemesis (Matthew Lillard), the interactions with his oldest daughter's annoying, then endearing, boyfriend (Nick Kraus) or the perfectly conceived ending, another thing Payne is very good at.It's a generally depressing vision of Hawaii. The opening narration by Clooney, accompanied by travelogue-type panoramas of a traffic choked highway and crowded city streets populated by sullen poor folk, seems bent on dispensing with any notions that Hawaii is "paradise," though much later in the film Clooney's character clearly describes it with that very word. In sum, this feels a little too much like territory already explored, but I'd still recommend it for some brilliant sequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Descendants is a downer. It revolves around a vindictive, self- centred, rude father played by George Cluny and his even ruder daughter.The wife is in a permanent coma. The father is obsessed with an affair his wife had before her accident.Very little happens but people sniping at each other or figuring out ever new heights of insensitivity as the pair inform people of the situation.It takes place on Hawaii. The film makes Hawaii very unglamourous and dingy.There is only one scene when anyone treats anyone with kindness, the surfer dude boyfriend with brain damage commiserates with Dad.One of the few bright spots was when Beau Bridges makes a cameo appearance as an incoherent cousin.I kept waiting for either something to happen or the movie to be over.The movie's only redeeming value is it deals with pulling the plug without wrapping it in layers of Christian cotton floss and denial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've only now seen this movie many months after everyone else. Many of the positive reviews I see here mention elements that I enjoyed, such as the very good acting by the young actress playing the elder daughter. I also agree with some of the negative comments - I thought it moved a little too slowly in places (too much scenery), and the attempts at comedy were a bad idea (Clooney running clumsily down the hill to a neighbor's house, the peering over the hedge bit, etc.) Maybe George Clooney is just too George Clooney to be believable as a regular Joe, but I was unpersuaded by any of his emotions: jealousy, betrayal, grief, anger, all I saw was George Clooney.I haven't read the book, so I don't know if the story elements I disliked were introduced by the filmmaker. I thought it silly that Clooney tries to track down his wife's lover by just wandering aimlessly around another Hawaiian island. And his final decision about what to do with the land might have meant something to me - and told me something about his values - but it was ruined for me by the unnecessary plot twist that involved his wife's lover in one of the bidding syndicates. And the ashes on the water ending was just too smarmy for words - the movie should have ended with Clooney's final scene with his wife.I don't know why the lover's wife has quite the large role she does. Her final appearance makes her a candidate for sainthood, but the movie isn't about her, so why go through this? Maybe they just needed one adult female in the movie to be likable?I kind of liked that Sid wasn't really as much of a jerk as he pretended to be, but nothing came of him.dvejr</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once they get an idea, they run with it, and run with it, and run with it. Maybe it's just me, but I'm struck by the number of indie or grown-up films I've seen of late that are depressing. Not that this movie didn't keep my attention, but I'd rather spend my 2 hours in the movie seeing something that kept my interest. Moneyball. Ides of March. So my review here is that you only go to this movie if you want escapist entertainment -- that is, escape right back into your very own miserable existence.As to the movie itself, I think it is a more realistic portrayal of a real world situation with a loved one on life support -- not like all the happy nonsense you see on the "Today" show where everybody is so happy that a parent has Alzheimers and the medical bills are eating up the estate. Here the medical problem central to the movie is ripping everyone apart. Realistic, but not my cup of tea on a winter evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being honest now...I wasn't expecting anything from this movie... First few minutes, I was like: "Okay...family troubles, teenage girls, etc.." But then the plot started developing and you could actually relate to those characters. In my opinion they were drawn out pretty well - I really liked Matt-George Clooney, his acting was flawless and also Alex-Shailene Woodley was great, she's a pretty young lady...Then her movie friend Sid-Nick Krause was pretty entertaining...It is a story about a father, dealing with his own personal troubles - wife in coma, 10and 17-year-old daughters, earning money for their living,.... As his wife encounters a serious injury, she's in a coma and he has to take care of his girls even though they're tough to handleThis movie made me relaxed, there wasn't any violence which is rare to see these days with all the shooting and killing. I wouldn't recommend it to small children but teenagers+older, it is nice family movie to watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rich bums in lovely Hawaii</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The New York Times has been running banner ads for this film for many months, so I went tonight with some degree of anticipation and was profoundly disappointed.Matt King and his wealthy family, part Anglo and part Hawaiian, own thousands of acres of land fronting the Pacific Coast on Oahu, deeded them by their ancestors and held in trust by them for the island. Matt's wife Elizabeth has been injured in a boating accident and lies comatose and dying in a local hospital. Alexandra, 17, and Scottie, 10, are Matt and Elizabeth's daughters; Alexandra stays at a private boarding school and Scottie lives with her father.Whether this setting provides sufficient material for a plot depends upon your taste for morbid and (on the other hand) jealous emotions without antecedent character development; filthy language spit gratuitously at the camera, primarily by children; long, prurient shots of a 17-year-old girl's thighs and bottom without accompanying tenderness; and a subplot about the affair Elizabeth was having with a local real estate man when the boating accident occurred that we are asked to care about--and that we see the main character, King, care about--even though half of the couple is effectively already dead, and we hadn't been privy to scenes of that relationship, either.In a nutshell: since we never see Matt and Elizabeth while Elizabeth is alive, we can't invest our emotions in Matt, either when he mourns Elizabeth's receding memory or when he feels jealousy upon learning (from his daughter, who is supposedly in school all day) about the affair that took place between his wife and Realtor Brian Speer. Matt's extended search for Speer in order to supposedly settle the score with him, including several chase scenes on foot, are utterly laughable. Indeed, Matt calls himself "an idiot", and we are inclined to agree wholeheartedly with him (along with the screenplay writer, who shares the blame), since anyone with any intelligence would write the affair off, and the bad feelings that arise from it, as his dead wife's final fling at life and then turn to the immediate task of emotionally and logistically preparing for her death. But since at least half the movie revolves upon Matt's pursuit of Speer for revenge or what has become morbid information, this while Matt is waiting for his wife to succumb, the temptation to simply walk out of the movie often proves stronger than one's enjoyment of the film's tropical vistas, it's annoying Hawaiian music (annoying because ironic, misplaced, and omnipresent), and older daughter Kayleen Woodley's legs.Clooney's expression runs the gamut from chagrined to chagrined--not that he's given much material to work with--and Woodley's performance, while nuanced by teenager standards, is marred by her character's gratuitously filthy and suggestive language throughout much of the film, which thoroughly removes any sympathy we might have for her from the her first appearance onwards. Some of the best moments, albeit brief, are spent with Realtor Speer and his ingratiating wife Julie, whose emotions seem more authentic, perhaps because more sparely shown.Unless you wish to spend eleven dollars to see stunningly beautiful tropical Hawaii on film here, there is no reason whatsoever to see "The Descendants". It is one of the most ill-conceived, purposeless movies ever promoted in the pages of the New York Times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>typically Payne-ful but forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne, best known for his low-key life-crisis films Sideways and About Schmidt, stays in his comfort zone with this film but opts for a slightly more family-friendly style. The Descendants follows the story of a middle-aged Hawaiian lawyer Matt (George Clooney) whose wife has been knocked into a coma and will eventually die. As he struggles to bring his somewhat dysfunctional family together to deal with her impending death, he finds out his wife was cheating on him. The backdrop to this is an on-going legal process in which his wider family are trying to agree on whether to sell a sizeable and beautiful piece of Hawaiian land inherited from royal ancestry. This film delivers a sentimental human drama whilst avoiding clichés. The trailer and opening sequence states this as the premise: "my friends think that just because we live in Hawaii, we live in paradise. Are they insane? How can they possibly think our families are less screwed-up, our heartaches less painful?" etc. The picture does seem a little too sugar coated though. Its saccharine idealism overpowers the raw edge and potency which typifies Payne's earlier films, such as Election. I get the feeling that even though I can relate to the characters on an emotional level, there's still an irreconcilable gulf between me and the Hawaiian upper-classes on a material level. I subconsciously dismiss the film as self-contained escapist cinema, making it as forgettable as it is enjoyable. It's one of those films where you feel like you've really enjoyed the experience, but can't remember much of it afterwards. It still retains Payne's unique essence, however. His originality, off-beat humour, lovably flawed characters, understated action and witty dialogue. The story world is very rich, but delivered in an easily digestible plot. Seeing the seemingly emotionally inarticulate protagonist deal with the complex social pressures bearing down on him is sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking, but always entertaining. While not as cutting as some of his earlier films The Descendants adds another refreshingly frank and plausible feature to Payne's consistently commendable filmography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light weight, Payne quirky dramedy, has its up and downs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Descendants' was directed by Alexander Payne, who also was a co-producer on the recently released 'Cedar Rapids'. Both films fall under the rubric of 'quirky indie dramedy' and director Payne seems to be drawn to this sort of quirky subject matter. While the 'quirkiness' and the 'comedy' are present in 'The Descendants', it's more muted than some of the other films Payne has been involved in.'The Descendants' involves how a family copes after the mother winds up comatose, following a near fatal head injury while water skiing, off the coast of Wakikiki in Hawaii. The husband, Matt King, somewhat mechanically played by George Clooney, is a Honolulu-based attorney who refers to himself as the 'back-up' parent. The first part of 'The Descendants' involves some rather ordinary scenes of Matt attempting to reign in his rebellious daughters (10 year old Scottie bullies a classmate and 17 year old Alex is found drinking when Matt goes to fetch her at the exclusive boarding school she's been staying at).Matt begins his journey of self-discovery when he's forced to make a decision as the head of a large family that owns a large parcel of land on the Hawaiian island of Kuau'i. The family has seven years to dispose of 25,000 acres before the family trust expires. Matt has openly backed the family majority's decision to sell the land to a wealthy developer, over the objections of many of the locals who fear that the pristine land will be spoiled by over development.I'll repeat here my definition of the quirky indie dramedy?it's a film that features a "quirky protagonist, who must go on a journey of self-discovery, shedding a repressed upbringing with the aid of quirky allies, while thwarting the goals of a reactionary group that wishes to maintain the status quo." The reactionary group here is the developer and the family members who conspire to sell off their land, to the detriment of the community at large. The quirky protagonist is Matt, who generally resorts to inoffensive, quirky machinations, to achieve his goals. The only real negative note that casts Matt (as well as daughter Alex) in a bad light, is when they refuse to accept the apology of Troy, who was driving the boat, when the mother had her accident. Otherwise, he can be found engaging in such quirky and harmless stratagems, such as mouthing off to his comatose wife in the hospital room or giving a passionate kiss, instead of a peck on the cheek ,to the wife of a man who had an affair with his wife, prior to her devastating injury.When Alex reveals that her mother had an affair with a man, Matt is determined to seek him out. This constitutes the 'second act' of the film and we're curious to see what Matt decides to do. Along the way, Matt gains an unusual quirky ally in the form of Alex's tactless teenage friend, Sid, who ends up being punched in the eye by the comatose woman's father, who holds Matt responsible for his daughter's injury.Through perseverance and outright luck, Matt finally tracks down the man his wife had the affair with; he's Brian Speer, a real estate developer, who Matt finds on Kuau'i, vacationing with his wife and kids. Fortunately there are no violent recriminations as Matt merely gives Brian a tongue lashing and promises to keep the affair secret from his wife (kudos to the screenwriters for keeping things low key and light weight!).Things get wrapped up in 'The Descendants' also on a low key note. Matt simply changes his mind and decides not to sign off on having the family sell the land to the developer. There may have been a taste of revenge on Matt's part, since Brian was set to receive some hefty real estate commissions, had the land been sold to the developer. But Matt makes it clear that it's his love of the land that compels him to go against the majority of the family's wishes.'The Descendants' is very light weight but has its heart in the right place. Not only does Matt get in touch with his altruistic side by keeping the land but also learns to become a better father. The family also is able to 'move on' after the mother is taken off life support. Only the quirky comedy (that's not very funny) gets in the way, epitomized by Julie Speer's rant, at film's end, when she 'loses it', revealing that she's figured it out that husband Brian indeed had been having an affair all along, with Matt's wife.I'm not sure if 'The Descendants' deserves all the awards it's been nominated for, since a main part of the story, Matt's decision to seek out his wife's lover, turns out to be markedly inconsequential. Nonetheless, the film is mildly interesting, especially in light of the protagonist's self-discovery, where the community benefits and a family is made whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Descendants (2011) - George Clooney is Totally Going to Take the Oscar Home!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, "The Descendants" is one of the most affective and heartwarming movies in recent memory. This is a realistic piece of storytelling that tells about keeping a family together, while trying to keep everything else from falling apart. George Clooney makes a terrific performance that would definitely lead him to an Oscar win. He plays Matt King, a successful real estate agent, whose wife is in the middle of a coma, after a boating accident. He tries to keep his head in the game, while trying to find the man who was apparently having an affair with his wife, and trying to take care of his two daughters, while making sure that they don't become spoiled and selfish brats. But apparently, they're spoiled and selfish brats. Shailene Woodley makes a brilliant breakthrough performance as Matt's older daughter, Alex. I thought she was a really good actress, and she did a pretty powerful performance. But I just don't understand why she got snubbed for the Best Supporting Actress category, when she was supposed to get nominated in the first place. We also get some crowd-pleasing performances like Robert Forster as Matt's cranky father-in-law, Beau Bridges as Matt's business partner 'slash' cousin, and Judy Greer as the wife of the guy that may or may not had an affair with Matt's wife. Co-written and directed brilliantly by the talented Alexander Payne, "The Descendants" is a heartwarming true-to-life tale of hope, love, and family. This movie perfectly captures the every-day struggles of a family in crisis. The realistic details can relate to what all families go through in real life. This movie had it's moments, and it perfectly deserves the credit. By the end, I was impressed on how this movie turned out. The script is top-notch, the casting is awesome, and the heart of this movie is potentially moving. This movie is enjoying from start to finish, and it really puts a mark on Clooney's career. "The Descendants" deserves it's Best Picture nomination this year, and I hope that George Clooney gets some of the credit. This is one of the more unique films of the year, and it's just your ordinary tear-jerking flick. "The Descendants", in my review, "an enjoyable motion picture, with a unique potential".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly unsentimental - good but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite a few surprises here. The movie is watchable and for unexpected reasons. First of all it's not a soapy drama - it is deliberately not emotional. In fact the hospital scenes at the end are completely unsentimental. Maybe because the dying wife is just so distant and an unsympathetic character. Secondly it is fascinating to look at the life of old rich Hawaiians, the Kings - George Clooney and his family (the Descendants).The family drama consists of a husband dealing with his children after his wife goes into a coma and the learning of her infidelity. The side story is a dealing with a valuable piece of land that has been in his extended family for generations.George's character is interesting in his realness especially stinginess driving a small Japanese car when he has lots of money and living in a shabby home with a dirty pool. There are some plot weaknesses. It seems unrealistic that he would go to another island to look for his wife's lover to tell him to say goodbye to her. I know he was curious but it just seemed far fetched.There are some unexpectedly funny moments of dialog from the daughter's boyfriend Nick Krause who like Thomas Haden Church in Sideways says inappropriate things. The father in law's nastiness is quite well written too.Photography is nice - it doesn't try to give you picture perfect views all the time or perfect weather. It has a realistic on location feel.Performances are good but not great. No one is quite Oscar worthy. George is quite good at looking frazzled and quite believable as a father. But he doesn't have much range to show. Shailene Woodley as his older daughter is suitably sullen but she is a bit beady looking and not appealing. Not quite worthy of nominations. The younger daughter isn't quite cute enough. Matthew Lillard is a strange choice to be the lover with his comical demeanor. Beau Bridges is quite suitable as a cousin of George.Overall it's no Sideways but it has it's funny moments and it's a transporting experience to the Hawaiian islands. As a family drama it isn't that emotionally involving but still definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

Trailers showing George peeking over bushes as if spying on his wife and Running around with a silly running style as if chased by his relative. The only thing real about the trailers were they were clips from the film. This is Hollywood Greed at it's most obvious. What next, Hollywood telling congress how to run the country... oh wait... that's been done! Maybe they will threaten us and move to France..... oh yea... that was also done before I found my new lifestyle. Acting: George Clooney gives another good performance. Matt Lillard in a short SERIOUS ROLE... Congrates on breaking the stereotype. The actress playing his daughter and the actor playing the idiot boyfriend were quite good... maybe another movie would help me remember their names Film: The movie was not as bad as it could have been. There were no special or outstanding performances. Cinematography was less than good considering it was filmed in Hawaii... surprising the photography and view wer3e not a least good. Music, really I don't remember any this is bad for $$$; no OST it is good from the standpoint you don't remember how bad it was. Considering the subject matter of a dying wife who cheated on her husband with a scumbag, Her workaholic husband having to reconnect with his children while being the executor of a large Hawian estate is really hard to classify. The reconnection with his children was played well.... I can not recommend this to any Christian or especially Mennonite. As to my old non-religious friends.... maybe as a rainy day movie with no redeeming value.. you know, for when you don't feel like a good old movie.Clooney lovers may enjoy George. Those who remember Wing Commander and Scooby Doo may enjoy the short role by Lillard. Rated 5 for average HollywoodAnd that is my Mennonite Perspective....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Descendants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After an unmerited winning an Oscar for supporting actor in SYRIANA (2005), George Clooney has been radiating his acting prowess since then alongside his director ambitions. After two nominated leading performances in MICHAEL CLAYTON (2007) and UP IN THE AIR (2009), I am ambivalent to judge if he is able to manage another stretch to bag another Oscar nomination seeing that he is not as multi-faceted as Jack Nicholson or DeNiro. THE DESCENDANTS is Alexander Payne's comeback work after the Oscar sweetheart SIDEWAYS (2004), a seven-year spell is rather too long for his ardent addicts (maybe partially is attributable to his ex-wife Sandra Oh), soothingly that the film has fetched all the accolades and been standing firmly under the spotlight as the frontrunner in the coming Oscar race (btw, the nomination is due in several hours, best wishes!). My opinion is that this film is excellent as though it fails to level with SIDEWAYS (a 9/10 for me), at any rate, it is Payne's another masterpiece which explores a viscerally connected rite-of-passage of a man and his family. An oddly dynamic tempo and a deeply affecting cinematography from Phedon Papamichael propels the film into a self-introspective journey both for the land baron Matt King and his viewers. George Clooney again locks up his prestigious celebrity identity and is vested a vast credibility to his character and showcases different layers of emotions, a surefire Oscar-worthy achievement. Two supporting ladies are striking too, Shailene Woodley and Judy Greer proffer their excellence and props both halves of the film respectively, Shailene possesses a drawing power of self-assurance as the defiant adolescent daughter, she is doomed to be a big name in Hollywood and an always snubbed Judy commits herself to her career-best within her paltry screen time. A doofus-looking Nick Krause and a chubbily cutesy Amara Miller almost of time are the comical toners and a mind-blowing comatose performance from Patricia Hastie also merits some tribute here. Otherwise the film's deficiency suffers a bit from its too deliberately concocted script and a far- fetched Hawaii magnitude (personally I cannot stand the periodic melodies in the film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Awards Hype May Make You Expect Too Much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Descendants" is the latest film of Alexander Payne, who directed that excellent "dram-edy" called "Sideways" a few years back. It has won a lot of accolades in this year's awards season, biggest of which was the Best Picture Drama from the Golden Globes. Its star George Clooney is practically already a lock for Best Actor at the Oscars. All of this awards hype make you expect an exceptional film experience.If you know "Sideways", then you should not expect "The Descendants" to be far off in terms of story telling and treatment. The story is about Matt King (Clooney), a busy real-estate lawyer, who tries to reach out and rebuild his family when his wife gets comatose because of a boating accident. His daughters Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) and Scottie (Amara Miller) have both become distant and disrespectful. A big secret of his wife gets revealed in the meantime that throws Matt's world into a bigger turmoil. This is a simple family drama Payne-style, not really "Oscar" material for a lot of people. Do not expect too much, or it may disappoint you.As for George Clooney, he is de-glamorized here as this harassed father with sassy daughters. Here, Clooney's Matt King was a desperate and weak character, but ultimately comes into his own as the story comes along, and we bear witness to his character's growth. He will definitely be a contender for Best Actor, even simply for playing against his usual slick, well-dressed, Danny Ocean-type characters. Clooney is quiet and subtle, much like his turn in "Up in the Air", but this one has more substance for me. Do not expect grand waterworks or big melodramatic scenes as would be expected from previous Best Actors in family drama movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants Starring: George Clooney Directed by: Alexander Payne2 out of 5 starsMyles Herod Entertainment EditorFrom beginning to end, everything that happens in The Descendants feels forced.I'll let you in on a little secret: the unspoken danger of a film as well-reviewed as Alexander Payne's newest is that it can rarely live up to its hype.An Oscar frontrunner, the familial dramedy imposed here is just as manipulative as it is manufactured, pulling at our heartstrings with forceful tugs and false tears.The story follows Honolulu lawyer Matt King (George Clooney), the prosperous offspring of a Hawaiian family who is dealt a hand of personal blows."Paradise can go f*** itself," he aptly bemoans in voice-over.Turns out that a waterskiing mishap has landed Matt's wife, Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie), in a coma. His two daughters, the precious tween Scottie (Amara Miller) and hard-living teen Alexandra (Shailene Woodley), are beyond his authority, with Alexandra in possession of potentially devastating news. "Dad, Mom was cheating on you!" she vents in a heated exchange, conveniently setting the film, and Clooney, on a mission to discover the identity of his wife's lover.The awkward script, penned by four co-writers (which may account for the film's uneven tone), manages to be simultaneously superficial, simple, mawkish and cliché.It's a shame, and a shock, for a man like Payne ? so talented, so biting in his previous Election and About Schmidt from years past ? that he would wait seven to fashion such a banal dud.Try as it might, the film's attempt at humour is largely entrusted to dad jokes, or cheap laughs, like Alexandra's stoner boyfriend Sid (Nick Krause), a character of great irritation and inexplicability.Truth be told, his presence and stilted delivery nearly ruins every scene he's in, making portions of the film's scenic beauty undercut by Payne's unwillingness to let up on Sid's idiotic quips. No family in their right mind would allow a doofus like him to tag along when dealing with personal betrayal. It's simply poor writing.Aside from that agony, the film finds Matt unfairly belittled by his surly, hard-nosed father- in-law (Robert Forster), a man who blames him for Elizabeth's accident.Adding to Matt's responsibilities is the decision (as head of the King family trust) to sell or bequest a large plane of unspoiled Hawaiian property, inherited from ancestors.The two narrative strands cross when Matt discovers that his wife's lover (Matthew Lillard), a yuppie realtor, is miraculously vacationing with his wife (Judy Greer) and kids adjacent to the rendezvous where Matt is meeting with family, most memorably his breezy cousin (Beau Bridges), to finalize their soon-to-be fortunes. Coincidence or contrivance?Despite the talented cast put together by Payne, The Descendants boils down to mediocrity of the highest order. My suspicion is that the film hit me wrong, but, perhaps, will hit some just right. Look no further than its seemingly universal acclaim.I have liked other Payne movies about middle-aged men on journeys of self-discovery, but I couldn't buy the convenient storytelling and erratic tone that litter this one.Clooney, always the affable star, gives the film's best performance, establishing a soft- spoken and refreshingly weary look, decked out in high-waisted slacks and floral-printed shirts.In terms of real acting, however, it's nothing new for the man, who relies on his expressive eyes and constantly pursed mouth, so common in better films like Up In The Air and The American.Having seen it at TIFF in September, where it premiered to upbeat enthusiasm, The Descendants has gone on to reap praise for its enlightened sensitivity.Best Picture predictions abound; this film, not unlike Slumdog Millionaire, encourages audiences and studios to feel good about themselves.Not me. Save for Clooney's solos with his comatose wife, the film's pathos left me cold and certain. In five years, The Descendants will be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the past five years--no debate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been stunned into a silent stupor at some of the reviewers who didn't like (or more likely understand) this movie. Granted, there are no fistfights, no car crashes, no naked women, and no breathtaking stunts or special effects. But if you enjoy a well-written, thoughtful movie that digs deeply into the struggles of being a single parent, or betrayal, of generation differences, or of simply being human this is YOUR movie. You won't be slapping your thigh and laughing until you bleed, and you won't be on the edge of your seat wondering if the hero will get out of a dilemma, but the plot is engrossing, the acting is miles above much of what Hollywood has to offer today, and George Clooney with his under-emotive acting reflects living in a real world for many individuals. The final scene with the family watching television (pay attention to what they are watching) encapsulates the entire message of the movie. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There were few films in 2011 that moved me as much as this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants opens in Hawaii with a woman named Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) cruising in a speed boat and then the screen fades to black. We discover that she is the wife of Matt King (George Clooney) and that during her boating race she suffered an injury that has left her in a coma. Matt is a lawyer looking to sell off the land he inherited from his ancestors because the trust is set to expire in a few years. As a father he is a failure. He doesn't know how to look after his youngest daughter Scottie (Amara Miller), whose behaviour has deteriorated in the wake of her mother's accident. Matt's other daughter is Alexandra (Shailene Woodley). She's seventeen and lives away in a boarding school. She's reckless and aggressive but Matt needs her help in looking after Scottie. When Alexandra reveals a secret of her mother's, Matt is sent into a blind rage and looks to track down a man named Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard). Compounding this is that he needs to tell his other relatives about the true fate of his wife. The imminence of death creates such a spiral in our minds that we lose sight of all that is beautiful in the world. This is the theme of Alexander Payne's adaptation of Kaui Hart Hemming's novel. Payne is a writer/director who, with films such as Election, About Schmidt (2002) and Sideways (2004), has mastered the art of small humanistic comedy- dramas. He is fascinated by how the ordinary and the banal are often the most chaotic and life changing adventures. It is easy to see why Payne was attracted to the source material. There are strong resemblances to About Schmidt, which was also about a man concerned with death and isolated from his child. Knowing the initial premise, I was concerned that the films might be too similar to each other. Payne is a gifted filmmaker but it remains perplexing that this is just the first film he has made in six or seven years. There was always the thought that he might be inclined to repeat himself. What impresses here though is the way that he has refined his craft. Hawaii is a unique, beautiful setting, sumptuously photographed by cinematographer Phedon Papmichael. Payne opts to use this aesthetic beauty to enhance the thematic concerns of his narrative. The beautiful opening shots of the green landscapes and beaches are juxtaposed with intercuts of the cityscapes, traffic jams, the sick and the homeless. We're told that this is no paradise and Matt adopts this mindset by spending much of the film tracking down his nemesis Brian. He carries a photo of him on the beach, forgetting all of the positive things around him. In the course of his absence, Payne seems to have lost a lot of his cynicism regarding character development. Growth stems from seeing a deeply troubled and angry man develop into someone who appreciate life's pleasures. Yet most impressive is that every character in this film, large or small, has a degree of real humanity. Many characters surprise us because they don't act the way we think they will or have come to expect from similar movies. When Matt finally tracks down Brian he is not the jerk that we assume he will be. He's an ordinary man on holidays with his wife (Judy Greer) and their two small children. She is a lovely addition to the film: extremely pleasant and welcoming but painfully unaware. Brian explains his mistake to Matt and reveals his commitment to his own wife. He is a weak man but we believe him anyway. Similarly, through many of these adventures Alexandra drags along her dopey surfy friend Sid (Nick Krause). He's an oaf but a mostly harmless one and he moves us unexpectedly when he reveals his own personal traumatic experience and how he deals with his problems. Payne's control over these scenes is deft and unintrusive. He has confidence in both the actors and audience, refusing to linger over the most poignant moments. His restraint builds a quiet realism and in turn we're met by a film that is regularly very moving. This sounds daunting but the film is also hysterically funny too. The humour is never cheap or obvious. The dialogue, often with a self-depreciative tone, is employed to reveal character and enrich the comedy and drama. A lot of the comments from the side characters are deliberately inappropriate, showing their lack of empathy or understanding of a situation.The effect is twofold: some scenes are very funny but others are built with powerful dramatic irony. There's a gutting moment when Elizabeth's father is telling everyone how good he thinks his daughter has been and how she deserved better, when we already know her secret. I can think of very few other films this year that have used dialogue as intelligently. Well-cast actors give the dialogue humour and feeling. Clooney's performance can be summarised as entirely glossless. It's a great part for him because he's given a range of emotions to work through, rather than a corridor of self-parody and smugness. He reveals a character who is helpless and yet desperate to control his children. He tries to be self-assuring too, telling us that his wife is going to be okay. Payne contrasts this with a high-angle shot of a spiralling staircase, foreshadowing devastating scenes of Matt's torment and verbal rage. A more controlled and empowered individual, who learns to make his own decisions, emerges convincingly. Clooney's fine work is also rounded by his impeccable and always reliable comic timing. This is a very impressive performance and one that could potentially earn him a Best Actor Oscar. Shailene is a standout as an impulsive, angst ridden teen, equally enraged and frustrated by the same woman as her father. There were few films in 2011 that moved me as much as this one. It's one of the year's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tear jerking, touching, powerful, engaging, yet missing something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Descendants" is not meant to be an entertaining movie, nor is its goal to be a pure tearjerker (thought this film has some elements of both), but rather it's objective is to reflect a family dealing with a tragedy and the repercussions it causes. Keeping the film's plot to a minimal, it is about Matt King (George Clooney), a Hawaiian land baron whose wife ends up in a coma via a boating accident. While trying to a close a deal that could get him rich, he tries to take care of his two rambunctious daughters, 17-year old Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) and 10-year old Scottie (new comer Amara Miller). In addition, he has to handle estranged family members and also learns the truth that his wife was having an affair. This movie sounds like a typical family drama along the lines of "Ordinary People," but I assure you that it is not. The focus is drawn solely on George Clooney as he delivers a roller-coaster of emotions. There are so many great scenes in this movie that show this man's talent. One that comes to mind is when he learns the news that his wife was going to die. Shock, despair, disbelief, and even a hint of anger develop on his face. He maintains these emotions so well that at this part, I no longer see the great movie star George Clooney. I see a middle-aged man who's thrown into a matter that any person can and possibly may have experienced?tragedy of a loved one. This man deserves the Best Actor at this coming year's Oscars. Though the lead, Clooney is not the only driving force. There is a great supporting cast. Shailene Woodley steals the show as 17-year old Alexandra. She at first comes off as a foulmouthed, belligerent teen, but as the plot progresses, her character grows and matures as she helps her dad in not only keeping the family together, but also assist in trying to find the man who had an affair with her mother. She'll be looking at a nomination too. Amara Miller plays a good brat, but she maintains a hint of likeness as a comic relief. Nick Krause as Sid, Alexandra's boyfriend, comes off at first as an ass, but like Alexandra, he matures as the plot progresses and becomes an unlikely ally for the King family.The script and direction is well thought out and brilliantly executed. Though slow moving, the story never gets dry or uneventful. The composition shots, whether it be the tight close-ups or beautiful landscapes are flawless. The music creates a nice undertone and feel for the movie, but I could have done without the Hawaiian vocals. One thing that I wished Alexander Payne put into this movie was the perspective of the comatose wife. I think it would have made this movie even more impactful if there were scenes of tension between her and the family, as well as how she was driven into the arms of another man. Giving a personality to the wife would have made a sadder and more powerful film. Since there is no back-story in her character, I feel nothing for her. She's just a body lying in a hospital bed, as shown vividly in this film. This may have extended the length a bit, but it certainly would have made it a better feature in my mind. Then again, Alexander Payne's objective is to focus on those affected by her condition, not her."The Descendants" is one of those movies you'll want to leave the kids at home and go see. Purely an adult movie, it'll play with your emotions and may strike home to those of you who have ever lost a loved one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable movie and a pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was not at the top of my 'to see' list but when I saw it got many nods from critics, I decided to go see it. I expected to see 'too much George Clooney', and yes, there he was in nearly every scene, but he portrayed the character so well! The elder daughter (played by Woodley) nearly stole the show with her acting.The movie starts with a woman enjoying a boat ride, and the next thing is she is in a coma, with her husband (Clooney) narrating the story. From that point on, we learn more about the family, the inheritance, the daughters he must bring up, and dealing with the secret revealed by his elder daughter about her mother, which is devastating. Clooney has done a marvelous job of showing all the mixed emotions- anger, rage, pain, sadness, confusion, helplessness, and the underlying love in subtle ways. The director has done a splendid job of mixing humor with the underlying tragedy that is at the base of the movie. The Hawaiian scenes are gorgeous, as expected. This is a movie about the challenges of life- we all have different ones- and some people, like Matt King (Clooney) find a way to overcome them. The changes in the daughters are remarkable too, as the movie goes along. There are many touching scenes but they never become melodramatic. The movie unfolds at a leisurely pace, and it quietly ends in a family room.This is not a movie if you are seeking sci-fi/special effects type entertainment (and I do enjoy those too), but if you want something about everyday characters and life, and want to laugh while some serious material, this may be the movie for you. I must admit that it was way beyond my expectations- I never expected it to be this good-, and I am glad that I did not read the story before seeing it.I was totally engrossed in the movie from beginning to end and I came out feeling totally satisfied that I saw an excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How does one make a movie about a man's wife dying better? Throw in the twist that she was cheating on him before her fatal accident. With that, I'd be hooked.As I was with Alexander Payne's brilliant film. From past films I knew Payne had a talent for weaving humor with pain, comedy with drama, light with dark. This may be his best effort yet, in my opinion... Some may disagree, but just know I'm not the biggest Sideways fan. But now, perhaps I will re-watch it. Anyway, I really enjoyed this.George Clooney really knocks it out of the park, as expected. Shailene Woodley, who plays Clooney's character's oldest daughter, does an unexpectedly fantastic job. Who is this girl? Apparently the star of some ABC Family show... Welcome to the movies, girl, you've earned it. And welcome back Matthew Lillard! Great to see you, you were terrific as well.

		<shortDescription>Honestly, Pretty Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was the first I've ever seen where, during the movie, I actually was so bored, I felt like MAKING the movie must be boring. I actually pictured the people on set listening to Payne's direction and staring at the walls, wishing he would be quiet, and thinking that no one could possibly give a damn about anything about this story.Obviously, I didn't get it at all (like most of his movies). He's the type of director, where I look at this portfolio of work and think, who would ever want to get into making movies about THESE topics. So, full disclosure, I'm not a Payne fan, and at least 50% of movies made to depict life as art and the experience of life are not really for me. But many movies of that type do touch me deeply and I get them. I totally get Lost In Translation, where many people most likely felt the way I feel about The Descendants. There's a way to take a great, fundamental, underlying idea, and communicate it through a careful, human, emotional, or even stoic way, that can captivate and resonate with an audience long after the movie is over. That is not the case here. So little of the back-story is developed that it seems impossible to me to bond emotionally to any of the events in the story. I've heard people tell me that much of magic of the storyline is the revealing of the true existence that is Hawaiian life (and not the sitting on a beach, not a care in the world, perfect weather depictions). How is that magic? I lived in South Florida for 10 years, my family still lives there. I live in Southern California now. Such a concept is probably not all that revolutionary to most people. Every place has a reality day to day culture aside from any of the perceptions of visitors and temporarily tourists. This is not a novel concept (to me anyway).Maybe you will see what other people see in this film, because I surely don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dramatic American masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's painstaking dramas are a vital piece of the modern cinematic landscape. Sideways was a piece of pure inspired craftsmanship, full of rich characters and a wonderfully intricate weaving of plot points that didn't feel heavy handed. Payne has perfected the art of the American drama into a craft, one that he continues to develop.The Descendants, which sports the best performance of George Clooney's career, is the best American family drama since American Beauty. Payne's careful attention to slowly crafting a script that features a complicated web of emotions, relationships, and mistakes has paid off in one of the most defining looks at the modern American family in all its glory and pitfalls.Set in Hawaii, The Descendants chronicles one of the most difficult periods of time in Matt King's life. Currently in the middle of negotiating a massage real estate deal that involves the land he and his family have inherited since the foundling of Hawaii itself, Matt finds himself taking care of his two young daughters as their mother (Elizabeth) was severely injured in a boating accident. Matt has been an absentee father, "a back-up parent", as Payne's script eloquently states, and now finds himself thrust in the spotlight.If the situation couldn't get complicated enough, Matt's eldest, troubled daughter Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) confesses that Elizabeth was cheating on him. The Descendants beautifully sets up a dramatic centerpiece which is full of a few unexpected and beautifully written plot points that keep things more than interesting. Payne's strength is the ability to continually keep the audience guessing what's next, knowing that whatever is on the horizon is going to enhance the already well constructed dramatic situation.Think about the last time the genuine feeling of surprise occurred at the movies. Few and far between. Payne is one of the who stays ahead of his audience, leading, instead of pushing them towards the narrative's climax.The ultimate strength of a drama relies on the fine line between telling the audience how to feel, and allowing the audience to feel the intended emotion. The best dramas take it a step further, presenting such a realistic emotional palette that the audience may not know what to feel, or feel several conflicting emotions at once. That is the high water mark for a drama, and Payne has put The Descendants among the best there is. More so than than the shining dramas of last year (Social Network, True Grit, King's Speech, Black Swan), a modern, un-stylized drama is difficult to get past the sniff test of smart audiences?there's no fallback to style.This is the life we all lead as Americans, and even though audiences will never know what went on in the courtrooms during the Facebook lawsuit (or if "Lawyer up, asshole!" was ever actually said), or how hard life really was on the rough lands of Arkansas for a Marshall and a young girl on a bounty hunting mission; audiences know how hard their own lives are. It presents the most difficult grading curve there is, and The Descendants couldn't have been a more effective and gut wrenching effort. It's no wonder it took Payne seven years to craft this, and it's his masterpiece... so far.OverallMovies are cheap laughs, easy entertainment, external stimulation, an adrenaline high, and exploitive money making devices. Movies are art, moving paintings, emotional experiences, and a cathartic way of coping and understanding the human condition. Some movies are a canvas for a visual genius (Malick, Fincher), a conceptual idea (Moneyball), or a novel undertaking (The Artist).Alexander Payne is the impressionistic genius of the modern American drama. Up close, it's beautiful and impactful, but when viewed from a step back, there's an overwhelming and emotional connection with something we can only connect with through art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matt King (George Clooney), a husband and father of two girls, must re-examine his past and navigate his future when his wife is in a boating accident off Waikiki.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Alexander Payne, the creator of the Oscar®-winning SIDEWAYS, THE DESCENDANTS is set in Hawaii and follows the unpredictable journey of an American family at a crossroads. Matt King (George Clooney), a husband and father of two girls, must re-examine his past and navigate his future when his wife is in a boating accident off Waikiki. He awkwardly attempts to repair his relationship with his daughters - 10 year-old precocious Scottie (Amara Miller) and rebellious 17 year-old Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) - while wrestling with a decision to sell his family's land. Handed down from Hawaiian royalty and missionaries, the Kings own some of the last priceless virgin parcels of tropical beach in the islands. George Clooney's Matt King joins the characters of Alexander Payne's previous films as a flawed individual finding his way through a world of lunacy, bittersweet emotion and surprises; he is neither a hero nor anti-hero. Like Matthew Broderick's envious teacher in ELECTION, Jack Nicholson's glass-half-empty retiree in ABOUT SCHMIDT,and Paul Giamatti's muddling, middle-aged wine country tourist in SIDEWAYS, King is not the man he would like to be. His mischievous daughters don't trust him, his imperiled wife has been cheating on him and his broke cousins see him and the land trust he controls as a piggy bank. To add insult to injury, he's surrounded by a lush, fertile, awe-inspiring landscape that defies his inner turmoil. Yet all of this leads Matt to a tumultuous awakening that might be awkward, comical and sometimes absurd, but nevertheless changes his concept of love, fatherhood and what it truly takes to be a man. Clooney's achievements as a performer and a filmmaker have earned him an Academy Award, two Golden Globes and an Emmy®, as well as four other Oscar nominations, six additional Golden Globe nominations, and numerous SAG, BAFTA, Emmy and Critics' Choice Awards. In 2006 he received the American Cinematheque Award and the Modern Master Award from the Santa Barbara Film Festival. Clooney's upcoming film projects include the political thriller THE IDES OF MARCH, Smokehouse's (the company Clooney started with Grant Heslov) first production under their deal with Sony Pictures. Clooney, who co-wrote and directed the film, stars with Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood. Originally from Omaha, Nebraska, Alexander PAYNE (Directed by, Screenplay by, and Produced by) earned his MFA in Film at UCLA and now makes comedies. He debuted with CITIZEN RUTH (1996) and followed up with ELECTION(1999), which won Best Screenplay awards from the Writers' Guild of America and the New York Film Critics Circle, as well as an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), premiered in competition at the Cannes Film Festival and opened the New York Film Festival. SIDEWAYS (2004) won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay and was nominated for four others, including Best Picture and Best Director."I mean, how often do old people just haul off and cold-cock you in the face?" -- Sid</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enough close ups of George Clooney! Half the movie involves close ups of George Clooney. George Clooney is pensive. George Clooney is annoyed. George Clooney is smiling. George Clooney is confused. George Clooney is angry. It is obvious from the opening of this movie - narrated by George Clooney - that this story will revolve around George Clooney. And what makes it worse, his character owns lots of land, and of course the question is, what's George Clooney going to do with the land. Now, there is good cinematography, but the movie lacks dramatic power, primarily because one of the protagonists is in a vegetative state, and this movie proves that it is hard to argue with a someone in a vegetative state. This movie contains some of the more annoying child actors. But no matter how annoying they act, they cannot upstage George Clooney. The director who directed Sideways scores a huge miss with this movie. Not that the movie is bad, it isn't, it's just that it tells a story ... and that's it. Everybody lives happily ever after. The movie deals with some serious themes - such as end of life issues, marital infidelity, familial discord, some ethical issues - but never quite delivers. George Clooney's character has every right to feel enraged but the best he can do is pout. Robert Forster was good. In fact, he should have played the George Clooney role. As for George Clooney, stop hogging the scenes and please ease up on all the close ups.</fullReview>

Wooden acting, poor timing (this may have be the director's fault), very annoying music, hardly any storyline and no feeling of involvement with any of the characters. Was it meant to be a comedy? It was more like a very boring poorly made reality TV programme. I just don't understand how a studio can spend millions of $, produce such rubbish and then have the cheek to put it out on general release. Apparently I have to have 10 lines of text to submit a review, but there really isn't anything else I'd like to say about this film. I quite liked the Sid character.

		<fullReview>The Descendants is a mediocre movie anchored by one of the best performances I've seen from 2011. George Clooney commands this film from the word go, giving a stripped down performance that is him at his most weak and vulnerable. He once again removes all of the charm and charisma he is known for and displays a broken man, lost in the world and desperately trying to find something to latch onto. This is a great character and he fully dives into it, a grown man who has never had to take any kind of responsibility and is now confronted with it in many different forms.With a comatose wife, two kids completely under his care and a land deal that determines the fate of his family's fortune, Matt King has so much on his shoulders and as the film progresses you can see that start to weigh on Clooney more and more. As he's been doing the past few years, it's another expertly internal performance that is breaking just underneath the surface while trying to give the illusion of togetherness to those surrounding him.Unlike those performances in recent years though, this one really gives him the opportunity to let some emotion pour out. There are many scenes in the film that had a major impact on me, thanks to this performance. He displays a level of openness, weakness and vulnerability that we haven't seen from him before. It's an absolutely phenomenal performance and I really wish it belonged to a good film, but unfortunately that isn't the case.Despite this impressive force at it's core, the story around it is so weak and meandering. It doesn't feel like there's any focus at all here in the writing, which I ultimately blame for what limits this film from it's potential. I don't think Alexander Payne tackles the subject matter with the gravity he should, and none of the comedic moments worked for me at all, but there wasn't much he could do as a director when working with such a lost script. It almost seems as though this was made to be a character study but they tried to give it too many narrative moves and eventually got overwhelmed by everything they had going on.Whether it's the focal point of King's wife going into a coma, the incredibly underdeveloped land deal plot or the wildly unnecessary affair subplot, the film never feels like it gains it's footing at all. There's an overflow of narration poured on within the first half hour and then it disappears altogether for the rest of the film. It seems as if they decided to throw everything they could at this character just to see what he would do, but then they didn't know what to actually do with all of those things they threw at him. It bounces from point to point, but none of them stick or really resonate at all.Payne is too vanilla of a director for the very dark places this film attempts to go and despite Clooney doing everything he can, there's no way to recover from the abysmal writing. The supporting cast ends up being a mixed bag, with the smaller performances by actors like Judy Greer and Robert Forster making a sincere mark but the more prominent ones from actors like Shailene Woodley and Nick Krause coming off as weak and very artificial (although Woodley does have a few good moments).Still though, every complaint I have with the film can pretty much be followed back to the screenplay they are working off of. Clooney is focused, emotional and absorbed into this role, but everything around him doesn't have half the authenticity or gravitas that he contains. It's the best performance in a bad movie this year, and honestly might be my favorite 2011 performance I've seen so far, period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome Back, Alex</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne paints a different picture of Hawaii. In the opening montage of his new film The Descendants, the director not so gently reminds us that the island "paradise," with its little-photographed cities and suburbs, isn't exactly the Eden we've been sold. The sequence perfectly reflects Payne's no bullshit pragmatism, seen last in 2004's excellent Sideways. For gluttons for Payne, The Descendants has been a long time coming.Based on a novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, the film follows George Clooney as Matt King, a wealthy lawyer with hereditary ties to Hawaiian royalty, and the sole trustee of his family's thousands of acres of untapped land. As King circles a buyer for the valuable property, his wife falls off a jet ski and into a coma ? but there are no saints in an Alexander Payne movie. Even the comatose Mrs. King has her share of skeletons.Few filmmakers walk the line between comedy and drama so effortlessly. The Descendants finds a happy middle ground in Payne's oeuvre, somewhere between the amusing introspection of About Schmidt and the droll wit of Sideways. And if the subject at hand seems too heavy or dry, never fear ? Payne's world is colored by conflicted, flawed, funny, but singularly endearing people.Take King's daughter's dopey friend Sid, a character with shades of Election's all-heart-no- brains jock, Paul Metzler ("You Betzler!"). Or better yet, take King himself, who bares all the familiar scars of an Alexander Payne protagonist. From his casual narcissism to his angered impulsiveness, King's foibles are many, brought vividly to life by George Clooney.Payne has a history of stranding his actors outside their comfort zone. Clooney isn't as malleable a leading man as Paul Giamatti, but there are sides of him in The Descendants that I haven't seen before. He plays King with an empathetic weakness many of his past roles have lacked. Clooney characters tend to overcompensate for their flaws with charisma, with interest. Under Payne, Clooney doesn't have the luxury of playing up that strength, and the results are revealing.This isn't the first time Payne has deliberately subverted audience preconception, either. No doubt he had Ferris Bueller in mind when he cast Matthew Broderick as a high school civics teacher in Election. He got Jack Nicholson (Chinatown's Jake Gittes!) to play a curmudgeonly widower in About Schmidt. In The Descendants, George Clooney, Sexiest Man Alive twice over, cries.Alexander Payne's films have been accused of being callous and misanthropic, but The Descendants highlights his earnest side as well. It isn't sentimental, and it earns it moments of sentimentality. Early on, the film teeters on the precipice of becoming a tacky father- daughter Movie Of the Week. The tropes are there, but Payne stylishly navigates a minefield of clichés in which most directors would eventually misstep.A near perfect combination of comedy and catharsis, The Descendants is an impressive film from a director who's been dormant too long. Seemingly, not much has changed for Payne since he released Sideways seven years ago, but the hiatus has made him no less confident in his unique American perspective. Welcome back, Alex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This side of paradise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reluctant patriarch thrust into various roles of responsibility after his wife falls ill; infighting between relatives over land; marital infidelity ? "The Descendants" has all the makings of a cliché-ridden cable movie of the week. What sets this film apart is not only the way it is memorably directed by Payne, but also the setting. It is Hawaii, and this Hawaii is not always the type of Hawaii that is sold at travel kiosks. In this Hawaii, there are swaying palm trees, gorgeous sunsets, and drinks with mini-umbrellas sticking out them, but there are also escalating tensions, moral and ethical dilemmas, and dire consequences. Paradise? "Paradise can go **** itself" the patriarch (played by Clooney, virtually in every frame of this movie) laments at the beginning.Coming from someone who was born, raised and still living in Hawaii I admired how Payne deconstructed Hawaii from its mirage as a tranquil sanctuary and instead unveiled it as a place with universal problems anyone from anywhere in the world could relate to. In fact, it is when Payne overly infatuates on Hawaii's hallucinatory beauty that the film loses its focus and deflates the central pathos of the film (the puerile Sid, mostly provided as comic relief, wasn't a strong point either). Consider the numerous shots of Hawaii's landscape, the constant use of cheery Hawaiian music, or in particular the sequence where Matt, along with his daughters and his older daughter's boyfriend, stroll along a sandy beach of Kauai, which goes on for an unnecessarily extended period of time, not adding any substantial depth to the story or the characters. It brought to mind Chris Isaak's video for "Wicked Game" where the imagery was not really saying much else except yes, Hawaii has nice beaches and scenery. Perhaps Payne became, like most people outside looking in, intoxicated by the mystique of Hawaii ? who could blame him? ? but when he detaches himself and steers back on track to the characters, their choices and the resulting consequences, the film excels.While "The Descendants" does an admirable job of breaking the mold of typical stories set in Hawaii, I consider it merely scratching the surface in redefining how people tell (and view) stories about this unique place, and I was left desiring more. Someday I'd like to see a film about the grittier side of Hawaii ? a film not told from the perspective of Punahou-educated upper-class characters that mostly inhabit this film (side note: Punahou is the most expensive private school in Hawaii, a school usually reserved for the "elite" whose alumni includes President Obama) but from common, ordinary locals. This side of Hawaii has been covered in some novels (the writing of Hawaii born/raised/educated Lois-Ann Yamanaka comes to mind), and even TV shows ("Dog the bounty hunter" is an obvious choice; never mind the sensational unrealism of "Hawaii Five-O," both old and new versions), but to see a serious film about the various adversities people in Hawaii face everyday could be an audacious vision in the right hands. With the amount of seedy activities that take place in Waikiki and Chinatown after dark, the increasing amount of corruption in the HPD, the shady dealings politicians and other elites partake in, or the dynamic relationships between locals and "haoles" that this movie barely touches upon, there's no end to the amount of material to draw from and depict that sometimes Hawaii is an idyllic paradise only on the outside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a friend of Bill W., you will love this film.Alexander Payne once again peers deeply into the tortured souls of lifes losers in the moonlight this time. One must look a little more than sideways to see that the characters are dancing with the gorilla alcohol. George Clooney is well cast as the sober scapegoat husband and father in a crazy making alcoholic family system which seems to be all of Hawaii and the United States. "what is it about all the women in my life who want to destroy themselves?"This drinking a love story begins with his wife whose extra marital affair just happened at a party during Superbowl Sunday. Also, her fatal boating accident while water skiing just happened.When George makes a surprise visit to tell his 16 year old daughter Alexandra of her mother's impending death, he finds her drunk and dancing under the moonlight on the golf course.Alexandra's boyfriend is not quite the overripe glamour boy of Sideways, but he has the same rebel like spirit setting up others to get angry. He later discloses that his father was killed by a drunk driver. Alexandra's younger sister tells her comatose mother that her sister has been drinking and is an alcoholic. She takes photos of her Mom who is in a coma and brings to school where her teachers criticize her? Why isn't this child honored for expressing her grief by sharing her art work?George's father in law blames him for his daughters death. The water skiing accident was George's fault because George was a workaholic and didn't buy his wife her own power boat? Perhaps we are evolving a new ideal of manhood in George Clooney who is CONSCIOUS, capable of self examination and noble in his ability to endure estranged sadness and frustrated grief which is common in alcoholic families without acting out in ways that hurt other people.

		<shortDescription>Paine's latest descends into predictability</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm definitely in the minority here, and probably could be called ungrateful since I went to a free preview showing in Alexander Payne's hometown that he was gracious enough to attend. But "The Descendants," for me, was just too, too predictable to be enjoyable.Let me qualify that first. The one thing that was NOT predictable was not being allowed some time with the comatose-then-expired ex-wife. She's in the opening scene enjoying a boat ride with no speaking role; after that she's a veg in a bed. Having no idea of who she is, other than a cheating wife and not that great a mom, I have a hard time seeing how anyone busts a tear when she does die.But I kind of had the impression Payne wanted a tearjerker; that's what my wife was expecting and didn't get it. I was expecting a comedy and didn't really get it, either (although a handful of people at the showing laughed aloud at some seeming inappropriate scenes). Not having tears and laughs in the way, I was able to focus on the story... and I didn't find anything really new here. The dilemma for the Clooney character was to sell the family's land for a lot of a money or a hell of a lot of money - as soon as the daughter reminisced about camping there, you thought "Oh, he CAN'T sell it." As soon as you found out his wife's lover would make the commission, you thought "Oh, he WON'T sell it." An hour later, he didn't.Clooney is playing the same character he played in "Michael Clayton" and "Up in the Air" (and with the same range of emotions), that of an "average" man with enormous pressures put upon him without looking for them but ultimately and always doing the "right thing." I've seen it before with him, I saw it here and I expect I'll see it again.The children were predictable as well. There's always a precocious younger sibling who always seems to get in their share of swearing. There's always a "problem child" who's been sent away, but once they get out there's a realization that they really have it all together. Again, cookie-cutter characters. I've never seen "Citizen Ruth," but similar to "Election," "About Schmidt" and "Sideways," there's an element of infidelity in "The Descendents" again. It's become predictable for Payne's films to have it, and - as expected - the victim of the infidelity is the last to know.As being land-locked in Omaha, one thing I did find interesting is the side of Hawaii that you don't usually see on TV or in films. Payne always does a good job of incorporating the local fabric, however.I did follow the story and it was well-told, but I have to admit to checking my watch as it seemed to stretch out. Had high expectations but I have to say this is my least favorite of Payne's. I look forward to his next, which he says will be set in Nebraska, but I hope it's something new and noteworthy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is he going to do next?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watch movies as a sociologist of cinema. My primary interests lie neither in the artistic qualities of a film, nor in the craftsmanship of the acting, direction, writing, or other aspects of the film's production. These are not unimportant to me, but what I care about most of all is the film's story and its depiction of human action and interaction. On this basis I rate "The Descendants" a fine movie. Not a perfect movie, not even a flawed masterpiece, but a fine movie nonetheless. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I watched it a few days ago. Not many films affect me that way."The Descendants" is a highly understated film. True, it is regularly punctuated by moments of intense pathos -- Payne allows many of the film's main characters (and a few of the minor ones) to have their emotive close-up moments -- but I found myself unmoved by any of them. However, I didn't see this as a problem; somehow it didn't bother me that I remained aloof from all the drama. What kept me engaged from the beginning to the ending was one central question: "What is he going to do next?" And the film never failed to deliver an engaging and provocative answer to that question.At the beginning of the movie we meet Matt King, an affluent and affable character, to be sure, but more "reactor" than "actor" in his life. He lets his wife parent (sort of) their two children, he lets "the cousins" lead him, as the sole trustee of the family's real estate holdings, to a necessary decision about a land transaction, and on a bigger scale, he lets his routine work as a lawyer substitute for intimacy with his family -- he is completely blindsided by his daughter's revelation that his wife was cheating on him before a boating accident puts her in a coma.Throughout the rest of the movie, we get to see Matt reckon with one decision after another. Virtually all of these decisions are put in motion through circumstances he has inherited. In this sense "The Descendants" is an appropriate title for the film. Like all of us, Matt King inherits a social situation largely not of his own choosing, but then he must actively choose what to do about it. How will he handle his difficult daughters? What should he do about his older daughter's new companion? When and how will he talk to his younger daughter about her mother? What will he do with the revelation about his wife's infidelity? Will he confront his wife's lover? Will he make trouble for that other man's wife and kids? How should he respond to disturbing new information about the land deal? And so forth. Not every decision is life-altering, but one by one they disclose the depth of Matt King's character. He turns out to be in possession of more nobility and grace than we are initially led to believe. Perhaps more than even he believed about himself. He's still human, but he's fundamentally a good guy trying to do the right thing the best way he knows how.Curiously, the story relies on a legal mechanism to compel Matt to take action in both major story lines: a law forcing the trust to be dissolved within a particular time frame, and his wife's legally binding advanced directive requiring that she be removed from life support. He can't not act. This forces him to learn how to do what he's been able to avoid doing up until that point. And the more practice he has at it, the more he realizes that he can do it -- indeed, that he must do it if he wants to truly live his life. There are a couple of surprises and twists along the way, but nothing earth-shattering. It's not that kind of a film. It makes its point quietly, subtly, underwhelmingly.Early on in the story Matt explains to the audience why he chose to live off his own income rather than off his inheritance. He says something to the effect of, "You want to give your kids enough for them to do something with their lives, but not so much that they do nothing with their lives." It appears that that was good advice. Like Matt himself, his daughters rise to the occasion when tested by trial. The closing scene is full of hope and promise of new beginnings as a family truly united.Payne appears to follow that same advice regarding his audience. I've read a lot of reviews that describe this film as a melodrama or "soap opera." I disagree, and I never would have drawn that conclusion on my own. Payne gives his viewers enough to do something, but not so much that we do nothing but wallow in the tragedy. There's no tragedy here, just real life. What are you going to do next?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family Angst and Mid-Life Crises in Paradise Anchored by Clooney's Sterling Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a great line in this 2011 dramedy spoken in a voice-over by the protagonist: "Give your children enough money to do something but not so much that they do nothing." I'm not sure if that came from author Kaui Hart Hemmings' source novel or from director/co-screenwriter Alexander Payne's pen. Regardless, it's hard to believe Payne hasn't directed a full-length feature since the acclaimed "Sideways" in 2004, as this 2011 dramedy most definitely bears his signature approach in focusing on a core set of flawed characters with a deft seriocomic hand. Although the movie is not quite at the level of "Sideways" in shaggily mixing humor with pathos, it does boast a strong performance from George Clooney as Matt King, a wealthy O'ahu-based lawyer with Hawaiian blood, who finds himself in the enviable position of being the sole trustee of 25,000 acres of untouched land on Kaua'i. Dictated by state law, he is just about to get his extended family of cousins to reach consensus on selling the land to a native developer when tragedy strikes.Co-written by Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, the main narrative revolves around a boating accident that puts Matt's wife Elizabeth into a coma. This tragedy highlights the fact that King, a workaholic by nature, has distanced himself from his two daughters, ten-year-old Scottie and 17-year-old Alex. Suddenly, he discovers he needs to step forward and confront Scottie's bullying at school and Alex's rebellious hostility. When it becomes clear to him that Elizabeth will never recover, he tells Alex they need to visit family members to give them an opportunity to say goodbye. The strenuously resistant Alex surprises him by sharing that she caught her mother having an affair before the accident. This starts a family journey that gives way to revelations and confrontations which allow him to acknowledge his own failures and make peace with what the future will bring. On the surface, the story sounds like it will turn into a straight-ahead tearjerker, but thanks to Payne's discretion, the emotions the characters express and the situations they face are far more disheveled than that and consequently more compelling.It's not that Clooney does anything that takes him that far away from his usual screen persona here. Rather, he backseats his trademark coolness to convey a deeper level of vulnerability and confusion as a man unprepared for single parenthood. As Alex, Shailene Woodley gives a terrifically nuanced performance traversing easily between unbridled insolence and supportive nurturing. Amara Miller provides the right level of precocious honesty in her moments as Scottie. The rest of the cast makes less of an impression, for instance, Robert Forster as Matt's highly coiled father-in-law and Judy Greer as the unsuspecting wife of the realtor who had the affair with Elizabeth. The one fly in the ointment is Nick Krause, who appears to serve purely as a comic plot device as Alex's stoner-dude pal Sid. This character is the one major misstep in Payne's treatment. On the upside, cinematographer Phedon Papamichael captures the Hawaiian locations with greater variety than you would expect, and the soundtrack uses purely Hawaiian music to great effect. This is worthwhile viewing mostly for Clooney's work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Descending from an unlikely world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Paradise can go f*** itself." - George Clooney, The Descendants.This is my introduction to director Alexander Payne's work, and hopefully, it will spawn many more in years to come. The Descendants is a non-sugarcoated, honest, and a realistic view of society held together with captivating performances of all ages, incredible dialog, and direction that holds together up until the final shot which some may not expect.The story follows Matt King (Clooney), a man living in Hawaii with two kids; a ten year old troublemaker named Scottie (Miller) and a seventeen year old rebel named Alexandra (Woodley). Lately, Matt has been under and uncanning amount of stress. His wife is in the hospital after being involved in a boating accident. She is now rendered comatose, and Matt is forced to look after his ten year old, before calling in his seventeen year old to help him out.On top of this, Matt is a very wealthy Realtor, trying to shy away from the luxury that his money can buy so his girls can grow up and not be spoiled and selfish. Problem is they developed those traits without the money. Matt is inches away from signing away 25,000 acres of land on Hawaii's island of Kaua'i he garnered from his royal ancestors. Doing this will make him wealthier and he has been contemplating this decision without rest until his wife is in the hospital.When things can't seem to get any worse, Alexandra drops a bombshell on her father that his wife was cheating on him before the accident. Matt is shocked, outraged, and demanding to find the man behind his wife's infidelity. Clooney is astounding, and he proves to us why he is one of the best actors in the business today. He drifts believably into anger, sorrow, frustration, and acceptance during all this, and plays the character of a stressed father in such a realistic fashion it's almost breathtaking.Shailene Woodley is also fantastic as Matt's daughter. She starts out as your typical daughter, but slowly morphs into a more recognizable human being rather than just a caricature, which is what most teenagers end up becoming in films like these.Hawaii serves as the co-star in the film. It's not supposed to, but it is. The reason being is the film tries to show its audience that Hawaii is no better on people than the mainlands are. Sometimes we get the impression in our heads that people in Hawaii are living the dream. The fact of the matter is, as narrated by Clooney exquisitely in the beginning, they aren't immune to sadness, their cancer isn't less deadly, and their problems any less serious.Why I'm praising The Descendants so greatly is because it's very easy to do a film like this poorly. The script is the key to a film like this, and if believability isn't reached and performances not cooperative with the material it could easily spiral into a whirlwind of clichés and mediocrity. Thankfully, The Descendants ignores that, and it showcases honesty and the ups and downs of every day life maturely and effectively. It also takes time with its character so we're introduced, and the cheater isn't discovered until later in the film which shows that the film had a laidback sense and is not forcing plot points down a person's throat.Many emotions are brought to the table. Seeing a good movie is never something I'm upset about, but sometimes, some films are so depressing, while well done, it makes for an iffy rewatch. The Descendants has much needed elements of humor, sad sequences, and heavy drama support all compiled into a brilliant script. And if you can really pick out the subtle messages in the ending, it's a happy one.The Descendants is fantastic, and Clooney's best work since in quite a few years. He shows us why he deserves the Oscars he's won, and why his publicity is worthy and not in any way undeserving or obtrusive. The whole thing is so pleasing and so well written even in its darkest hour that it should be the lesson to those inspiring to one day create a great, Oscar-worthy drama. For that it should be looked as a resource and not a blueprint.Starring: George Clooney, Amara Miller, Shailene Woodley, Judy Greer, Matthew Lillard, Nick Krause, and Beau Bridges. Directed by: Alexander Payne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Descendants" is Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney's Matt King stands on majestic hill crest with his daughters Alex (Shailene Woodley) and Scottie (Amara Miller) as they overlook the pristine blue Kauai beach cove which is part of the Hawaiian Lands Trust governed by Matt. Matt confesses, "Everything has its time." Writer and Director Alexander Payne's "The Descendants" is funny, poignant, and life affirming eloquence. "The Descendants" is by far the best movie of the year! George Clooney is awesome, giving his best performance, ever. As Matt he is powerful and courageous baring such raw emotion with characteristic charm, and striking authentic humanity. There is a scene where a tear streams down Clooney's cheek as he tells his wife, "Goodbye?" that had me in tears. Clooney deserves Best Actor for his heart felt and inspiring performance. Shailene Woodley is amazing as Alex. She is so natural and strong. Her partnership with Clooney, along with Alexander Payne's brilliantly restrained direction makes "The Descendants" very special."The Descendants" distinguishes Alexander Payne's return to the movies since his "Sideways". Payne wrote the screenplay along with Nat Faxon and Jim Rash based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings. Hemmings also appears as Matt's secretary. There are other great local touches. Surfer legend Laird Hamilton has a key role. My friend Jon's Mom's house is on screen as Matt and Alex drive through Diamond Head. The movie trailer does not do justice to the depth and richness of "The Descendants". In fact not until you watch the movie does it become transparent the significance of the title. Payne's "The Descendants" is funny, sad, and inspiring?like life.George Clooney plays Honolulu transactional law attorney Matt King. Matt is the sole Trustee of the family Hawaiian Lands Estate that dates back to the Kamehameha monarchy. Matt diligently manages the sale of the Estate before the Trust expires in 7 years, looking to broker the optimum deal for his numerous cousins. Matt is earnest and dedicated, not exploiting any trust money, choosing to live off his income as a successful attorney. Tragedy strikes. Matt's wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) is in a coma following a boating accident. Matt doesn't really know his daughters 10 year-old Scottie (Miller) and 17 year-old Alex (Woodley), admitting "I'm the backup parent." Scottie is not coping well with her Mom's crisis sending a bullying text to her friend. Matt and Scottie retrieve older sister Alex on the Big Island where she is attending a special school to deal with her drug addiction, something she may have inherited with her Mom. They find Alex not high, but drunk.Elizabeth's doctor tells Matt that his wife will not recover from the coma. Her will instructs the termination of life support?she will die. Painfully, Matt tells Alex her Mom's fate. Woodley is sublime as she literally submerges into tragic despair. Later tearful Alex unloads emotional bombshell, "Mom was cheating on you." Clooney is amazing as the look on his face transforms from disbelief to sheer despair and anger, peeling down the road in his rubber slippers. Payne always balances the paradox with panic and humor.First order of business: Matt must tell his disapproving Father-in-Law Scott (strong unforgiving Robert Forster) about Elizabeth. Scott's wife suffers from Alzheimer's. From Scott's point of view Elizabeth was the perfect faithful wife, who deserved a better lifestyle from Matt. Matt and Alex determine that the other man is real estate broker Brian Speer (selfish Matthew Lillard). The King's along with Alex's ex-Punahou classmate Sid (stoner charming Nick Krause) in tow head off to Kauai to search for Brian. Sid is an apparent goof, who Matt tells "You are a 100 miles from smart." However, Payne generously distinguishes that the people in your life will often surprise you with their greatness?their innate nobility and compassion. Forster and Krause display their quiet heroic best. Also surprising is Judy Greer as Brian's wife Julie?comedic and dramatic genius. Amara Miller is so great in a heart wrenching moment as the hospital doctor tells her about her Mom. Everything in "The Descendants" feels true and just so.Everything has its time. In "The Descendants" life happens and life goes on. The highest praise for Clooney: He would make a great Dad. At narrative arc his Matt tells Cousin Hugh (laid back Beau Bridges), "Just trying to keep my head above water." Matt doesn't always know what to do, and Clooney makes this work embodying his courage and compassion. The last scene of "The Descendants" is eloquence beyond words. Life goes on. Love those who are dear to you. "The Descendants" poignantly reminds us of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too casual for its own good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With it's laid back setting and attire ( "everyone looks like a bum or stunt man" narrates the protagonist) Alex Payne's The Descendants adopts a matching leisurely pace that two thirds of the way through will make you feel like your on a beach in Honolulu in the throes of slumber. Veering from sharply original to suds The Descendants meanders about under the tropical sky of Hawaii accompanied by wailing ukuleles long enough to move the viewer from sympathy to fatigue for most of the principals.Lawyer Matt King (George Clooney) is under a lot of pressure these days trying to finalize a land deal that will impact his whole family but an Hawaiann Island as well. When his wife has a jet ski accident that puts her in an irreversible coma he gathers the rest of his dysfunctional family two daughters he hardly knows. Much to the shock of clueless dad, the oldest reveals mom was having an affair with a real estate salesman. As mom circles the drain King takes the daughters on a vacay to confront, it turns out, the married with children seducer.Director Payne delivers the American scene as well as anyone in film today. His ability to approach the mundane and slightly tawdry and breath fresh air into it with subtlety and originality has produced a quartet ( Citizen Ruth, Election, Sideways, About Schmidt) of sharp minimalist satires. In The Descendants there are more than a few gems both comic and tragic that display Payne's outstanding ability to keep the audience off balance. The film begins to wander midway however with repetitive family quarrels and excessive exposition. Unlike his other brisk offerings on the morose underpinnings of the American Dream he wallows in it here without benefit of timely injections of his sharp edged satirical bent.Like all Payne heroes King is a mass of contradiction and hypocrisy both noble and petty. Clooney forced to rely more on facial expressions and displaying a lot more incertitude without his usual devices (gun, love interest, dark villains and situations) does a fine job of stretching his thespian talent in another direction sustaining the storyline with deceptive ambiguity. Robert Foster is brusquely poignant as a father facing the loss of his daughter while Judy Greer as a wronged woman almost steals the film in a hospital visit scene that is classic Payne. It's a shame the rest of the film wasn't as healthy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember about seven years ago when video rental stores were still in their prime and I frequented Hollywood Video instead of Netflix when I picked up Sideways on a whim, brought it home, and thoroughly enjoyed it but never really had the chance to talk to anybody about it. It was long before I started reviewing movies and most of my friends have the typical guy taste in movies: if there isn't a ton of nudity, blood and violence, or explosion of some kind in the first ten minutes then they essentially get bored with it and fall asleep or turn it off without giving it a proper chance. So I kind of felt like I was this closet Sideways fan for years. Up until The Descendants, it was actually the only Alexander Payne directed film I've had the chance to see as well. With that said, I'm also not the biggest George Clooney fan. His pretentiousness in real life seems to have crossed over into many of his performances and my favorite memories from his acting resume are mostly Seth Gecko from From Dusk 'Till Dawn and Sparky and Dr. Gouache from "South Park". There have obviously been better movies of his since then (O Brother, Where Art Thou? Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Up In the Air, and Fantastic Mr. Fox are personal favorites), but none have spoken to me the way Seth Gecko did. There has already been quite a lot of Academy Award talk with The Descendants, but Clooney's roles always seem to be associated with The Oscars so that wasn't too surprising. However The Descendants proved to not only be one of Clooney's best on-screen performances but is also one of the best 2011 has to offer.Visually speaking, The Descendants is extraordinary. It's filmed in Hawaii after all, so it's kind of difficult to make it look bad. The scenery is almost overly-beautiful even though much of the film is overcast Hawaii's green landscapes and clear ocean water makes nearly every scene visually striking. Even when it's raining you can't help but feel the urge to visit this amazing place or return there if you've been fortunate enough to have gone to Hawaii before. There's also a staircase scene where we're looking down at Clooney while he's climbing stairs that caught my eye while he narrates about his life which mostly revolves around trying to fix a broken marriage. It sounds so simple on paper, but it's one of those scenes where the camera was in the right place at the right time and makes something so brief memorable.This is easily the most emotional George Clooney has ever been in one of his performances, as well. He's on the brink of a breakdown the entire film and while I would've liked to have seen something a bit more expressive especially after the hype for "his first on-screen breakdown," what we do receive is still really emotional and heartfelt. Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller are also fantastic as Matt King's (Clooney) children. They provide many of the laughs a good portion of the film and show they're also fully capable of displaying what feels like sincere sorrow and emotion. That's one of the best things about The Descendants; it provides plenty of hilarious laugh-out-loud moments but also isn't afraid to show you more tender moments that tug at your heartstrings. Alexandra's (Woodley) friend Sid (Nick Krause) is very entertaining, as well. His scenes in the car and at Elizabeth's (Patricia Hastie) parents' house are some of the greatest the film has to offer. Matt's friends Mark (Rob Huebel) and Kai Mitchell (Mary Birdsong) are also a highlight. Mark provides some really hilarious one-liners while Kai is obviously a very devoted friend to Matt's wife Elizabeth.There are little to no faults to be found in the film. The entire cast delivers, the story unravels in a very pleasing fashion, and the film is magnificently shot. There's very little to be unhappy with. Even the Hawaiian music was a high spot. While I'm not the biggest fan of foreign music, this was generally very soothing featuring Hawaiian lyrics accompanied by guitar or ukulele plucking. The one thing that might come off as kind of silly is the Matthew Lillard kitchen scene being fairly reminiscent of the ending to Scream, but that was more humorous than anything.I'm sure it differentiates a bit from critic to critic, but for me the best movies are not only the ones that feature talented casts, engrossing storytelling, and solid scripts but are also the ones that manage to affect a wide range of your emotions. The Descendants does all of that and then some. Every performance feels genuine and the never-ending downward spiral feeling the story gives you is resolved in a way that not only feels natural but is completely satisfying. This is George Clooney at his absolute best and it's safe to say that Alexander Payne has outdone himself. The Descendants is chaotic, charming, hilarious, and emotional. It's quite possibly the most powerful and emotion-evoking film of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was characterized as a "comedy" but there was very little funny or even amusing about it. Even the minor comic relief of the Surfer Sid character is undermined by a late late tete-a-tete that reveals he has tragedy in is recent family history as well.There is very little to establish a real connection with any of the characters. As the rich real estate lawyer, Clooney gets plenty of screen time in close up emoting mode. Sure, he is in a terrible, tragic point in his life. But so what? What makes me connect? All the other characters seem to be props or foils for the lawyer King's reaction shots.The location is beautiful but ultimately becomes a travelogue background. For example, why go to the Big Island? I guess to show the white rock graffiti on the basalt fields.Same with Kauai. Besides using the Hanalei beach house for background and the sweeping view of the valley, not much value in moving the story forward.With no establishment of the marriage conditions pre-accident, King comes across as a totally engaged, totally bereaved husband and father. Where is the tension?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific acting from cast disguises paper thin soap opera story and overbearing musical score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pros: Acting performances all around, especially from George Clooney and Shailene Woodley as Clooney's 18 year old daughter. Clooney pretty much carries the movie by his acting alone, even when nothing of significance is ever going on. Also, the key characters are given a significant amount of depth, so no one really feels like a caricature, except for Sid (Woodley's boyfriend), who was basically written into the movie for a few quick laughs. Cinematography is also solid, as one would expect in a movie filmed in Hawaii. It never takes center stage - and is always a supporting role in the film, as cinematography and visuals should be.Cons: The musical score, with its soft, Hawaiian, plucking guitar strings, is used far too often during the film - as if director Alexander Payne is begging for the audience to cry and care at certain moments. There are also too many instances of tears flowing from characters' faces (mostly Woodley's), as if the film is trying to direct the audience on when they themselves are supposed to tear up. It just feels too manipulative in these moments, as if this is a Lifetime movie or Dr. Phil episode, instead of just letting emotions and truth appear naturally. Also, the film feels way, way longer than it needs to be. This is essentially an 80 minute story stretched out to a bloated 120 minutes. It literally takes 30-40 minutes in the middle part of the film for Clooney and his daughters to track someone down, when that should have taken 5-10 minutes of screen time. Some parts in the 2nd half are plodding and slow, until we have the formulaic tearjerker finale.Strong acting performances aside, I expected more from this movie's script, given the fact that I loved Election, About Schmidt, and Sideways. This feels more like an unfinished draft, with too much music and beautiful, lush beaches added in to fill in the void of a tighter, more compelling story. All in all, it feels more like a Lifetime or Hallmark station holiday movie, rather than a memorable piece of storytelling. I have a feeling this film will resonate more with female audiences, as this type of chick flick "affairs and backstabbing drama" seems more up their kind of alley. Maybe this is part of Clooney's marketing strategy now when he releases a movie? I noticed the same type of "chick flick" focus in much of the plot in "Ides of March" a month ago. I think the studios know that Clooney brings in the female audience, especially the coveted female audience over 40 years of age, so maybe they are now targeting his movies towards them? I sure hope not. I'm a male and I thought "Up in the Air" and "Michael Clayton" were brilliant, but these last 2 have really underwhelmed me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much to this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting to showcase Hawaii, the off the resort real community flavor of its residents and also the beauty of the tropical landscapes hovering behind white beaches and azure waters making you wish you were there on a cold November day, however, there is not much to this movie. It was neither entertaining nor was it interesting. There really is not much of an interesting story premise. A rather well off man who owns land in Hawaii whose wife gets into a boating accident and is in a coma decides to bring back his kids during this difficult time. The major drive and climaxes deal with decisions as to what to do with the wife who is in a coma and what to do with the land thats in his name. One of these decisions unfortunately becomes very predictable.For these mostly slice of life tales, character creation and development are crucial. Unfortunately its difficult to care for these characters. The wife in the coma has only 1 aspect to her character and personality and that one thing which we already learned from the previews is that she cheated on him. You don't feel sad that she is in a coma, maybe thats a good thing, but you just don't feel. You don't really care about any of the other characters either. The children don't have a lot of dimensions to them. The supporting characters of the cousins, the wife's lover and his wife have very small roles. George Clooneys character isn't too interesting either. As opposed to this filmmaker's main characters in his other movies, the main character in this movie has rather cliché emotions and feelings. It is mildly interesting to see how his twisted feeling are portrayed towards his wife he recently discovered was deceptive yet is in a coma.This was disappointing because the filmmaker's previous movies delved so much into interesting believable characters with plots and writing that emanated a fun, creative, dark humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story didn't follow the title of the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I am missing something but I didn't get it with this movie. The title of the movie doesn't coincide with the story. The story to me is about a man (Clooney) who struggles with his emotions when he finds out his wife cheated on him. Throughout the movie he has this relentless search to find the paramour, this man who apparently had an affair with his estranged wife.In the meantime there is a group of 'descendants' who we know very little about except they are a group of fortunate souls who shall inherit millions of dollars upon the sale of prime real estate. Mr. King (Clooney) as the trustee of the real estate has the unenviable task of making or breaking the sale. The question becomes 'what does any of this have to do with the theme of the story which seems more to do with his failed marriage?' We know very little about Mr. King or his children (two daughters, one seven years of age and the older sister aged 17). Though they are in at least half the scenes all we learn about them is they are rebellious kids, the elder of the two who explicitly vents her anger against her mother. But why? At the beginning of the movie Mr. King discusses with the audience his apparent lack of communication with his wife and at first it seems the movie will take us down the path of his life and failed marriage. But that does not happen.All we know is that Mrs. King is lying in a hospital bed apparently already dead if not for the breathing apparatus that keeps her alive. But we learn nothing of the troubled marriage or of the estranged wife who is dying before our eyes. Yet, the descendants keep popping up in the movie like a sideshow. I mean, so what? The heirs shall soon become millionaires, yet Mrs. King is about to lose everything including her life. So who is this dying woman and what is her life about? We are not even shown a flashback of this person or even know what she looks like prior to the accident. There is a scene where a photo of an attractive blonde is offered but no dialogue explains who is in the picture.As the movie went along I wanted to learn more about the dying woman. After all, is that not the tragedy of the movie? The poor girl is losing her life yet the director would have us believe the Clooney is the victim here. Poor Mr. King is left behind with his bratty kids and millions of dollars. I doubt the good-looking, wealthy Mr. King will have any problem with his love life, nor in the financial arena.This movie would have worked if it spent more time on the life and family of the dying Mrs. King. The descendants had absolutely nothing to do with anything. Clooney acted a decent role but it was far short of phenomenal and Oscar quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An odd and dorky Clooney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George spent a lot of time as his Hawaii dad character in this film with a clueless, deer-in-the-headlights look that was funny at first, but became his standard look throughout due to his mostly absentee-father's inability to gain a clue about his family's inner workings and how to deal with them after his wife was badly injured and he had to take over as the functioning head of the family. With his injured and formerly cheating wife now almost dead, his unruly kids running amok, and his big family real estate deal not settled and very confusing, he was clearly out of his depth as a husband and a father and was totally baffled about the best way to lead his kids toward a better life and his many relatives toward their chance of a lifetime real estate deal that could make all of them fabulously wealthy. The workings of those problems were the basis of the story, with a bit of his Hawaiian heritage backstory included to round it out. Seeing George as other than his typically so-cool and suave self, and pulling it off well, showed us that he has learned to be a very good actor and can inhabit a role totally opposite his own persona and make us believe in it.The film has been touted as a possible academy award contender, and it did have some good moments, but that accolade is a stretch, IMO. Most of the players did a good job in undemanding roles, but I was especially encouraged that his almost-dead wife in a coma was not glorified with lots of phony make up and an only-sleeping look in order to appear almost normal, as is done in most films. She looked realistically terrible, as she actually would in real life. But, the story lacked serious dramatic tension and mostly meandered toward a very predictable conclusion, both in the family's new-found cohesion and in the big real estate deal, and had no surprises at all so a higher rating was not truly earned. A good picture and worth seeing, but certainly not a great one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a slow, boring movie about a middle-aged man with a wife in a coma. I can't fathom the rave reviews.I've spent a lot of time in Hawaii and know the types of people and places depicted here. I acknowledge that the filmmakers were far more sensitive and respectful of Hawaii than most. They tried hard to capture the true feeling of the place. The skipped a lot of disrespectful, lazy stuff that outsiders do when depicting Hawaii. That is to their credit. At the same time, the feeling isn't there. The movie often reads like an ad for high end real estate. There's something missing.This movie has been compared to Sideways, another movie from the same director. That is also about a middle-aged man. To my mind, Sideways was a better movie, more lively, more humorous and with more to say about life and human nature.If you want to see a recent movie that captures the feeling of Hawaii, Soul Surfer is one example. As far as books, I'd recommend, The Territory of Men by Joelle Fraser, and West of Then by Tara Bray Smith. The last is the true story of a family that used to own a plantation and what became of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A major disappointment from a great director and a great actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The buzz about this film has been Oscar-worthy, but the actual film is a major disappointment, particularly because it was co-written and directed by Alexander Payne, whose earlier films include the brilliant SIDEWAYS and ELECTION, and whose 7-year absence from film has been deeply felt.THE DESCENDANTS feels more like Payne's ABOUT SCHMIDT, which gave Jack Nicholson a good late-career role but was still just another road movie. This film feels underwritten and too often predictable. There is little doubt where we are going, but Payne's journey to get us there is too often uncertain in tone. Scenes and incidents, some funny, others sad, are set up, and then don't pay off.Clooney gives a good, understated performance, but his character's changes, from selfish, stingy, uncaring father and husband, to loving, concerned dad and human being, are never dramatized; we're just supposed to accept it. The whole cast is good, even Nick Krause in the Keanu Reeves role from "Parenthood" (the scene where the dopey teen gives advice to Clooney about his daughter is the same as Reeves giving advice to Dianne Wiest in the earlier film).Some times it feels as though the film were too heavily edited, and the missing scenes would have answered all our questions and satisfied our emotional needs. Perhaps reality TV has inured us to "real" drama, and Payne is simply reflecting an audience's inability to respond to a non-reality dramedy. Just hypothetical, but how else to explain the ultimate emptiness of an "important" film that just doesn't deliver?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Film Filled with Outstanding Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not entirely sure where George Clooney ends up if you ranked all living and active actors in the industry today but I know he'd be high up the list. I'm of the opinion that, from a performance standpoint, there is nothing the man cannot do. Comedy, drama, voice work, or sheer power, Clooney delivers no matter what his assignment might be. One thing we haven't seen from him, however, is vulnerability. He's had a few sobering moments to be sure, like the gut wrenching moment of truth in Up in the Air, but never a wholly open performance. I would guess that's by design and that Clooney's roles take a cue from his real life wherein he is usually extremely smooth and enviably cool while remaining private and somewhat mysterious. With The Descendants, however, Clooney shows off another side of his abilities and further establishes his dominating presence in the pantheon of great American actors.Matt King (George Clooney) is by his own admission, "the back-up parent." As the heir to a massive tract of Hawaiian land, he spends most of his time working on a huge deal that will make him and his cousins all filthy rich while simultaneously juggling the needs of his law firm. His life is put into perspective, however, when his wife is involved in a boating accident that results in a deep coma which doctors fear she will not come out of. When dealing with the antics of his youngest daughter, Scottie (Amara Miller), proves more than he is capable of handling, Matt brings his oldest daughter, Alexandra (Shailene Woodley), home from boarding school. Alexandra, though, has her own set of issues and soon informs Matt that his wife was cheating on him, leading to the conflict between mother and daughter. Frantic and torn between his ever- increasing responsibilities, Matt takes his daughters, along with Alexandra's friend Sid (Nick Krause), on a short vacation that conveniently serves as an opportunity to track down and confront his wife's lover.Written and directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways), The Descendants serves as a master class in storytelling. The opening scene pulls you in and engrosses you in a supremely compelling narrative that refuses to let go until the closing credits roll. Matt's relationships are often complicated and far from perfect but Payne paints a picture in which you are able to see the heart of the man beyond his flaws, which is for me a key to this film's success. Nothing about The Descendants is especially easy or comfortable (as you can probably tell from the summary) but the story is crafted so well that you can't help but play along through the many awkward situations Matt finds himself in. Moreover, Payne manages to find real and genuine humor within what should be tragic circumstances and his actors bring that to life tremendously. At the same time, the humor never becomes disrespectful or foolish but rather sensitive and mature. The drama-comedy blend is near seamless, making the truly funny moments laugh-out-loud worthy and the more serious scenes all the more impactful.All of this brilliant behind-the-camera work would be for naught, however, without an outstanding cast which thankfully The Descendants has. As he always does, Clooney nails his part, bringing a sense of fragility to Matt while still exhibiting that calm and easy manner that makes him so appealing. Multiple times he takes Matt to the brink of breaking down then pulls himself back together in time to save face in front of his daughters. I'm not sure it is his absolute best portrayal (I think his work in Up in the Air is slightly better), but it is a powerhouse performance that will undoubtedly earn some major award nominations. This isn't all about Clooney, however, which is what I expected. Each actor that comes on screen brings something to the table, leaving their own marks on the film as a whole. Krause and Miller are both better than I could have hoped given their respective lack of experience and Judy Greer gives a turn that I didn't know she was capable of. Then there's Woodley who goes toe-to-toe with Clooney on a number of occasions and more than holds her own. This is a girl who starred on The Secret Life of the American Teenager, one of the worst TV shows in recent memory and yet in this setting, she is outstanding. Alexandra is foul-mouthed and harsh but Woodley brings a sense of humanity to the part and makes you feel as if this is exactly how this character should be. The dynamic between Alexandra and Matt is exquisite, at times the driving force behind the film. There is a remarkable chemistry that exists between each member of the cast and I think that's partly due to Clooney's easy manner and partly due to Payne's efforts to have his actors grow together long before the cameras rolled.To top it all off, the gorgeousness of the Hawaiian backdrop along with a native-themed soundtrack helps set the tone for The Descendants and adds a "trouble in paradise" theme that only deepens the drama-comedy blend. In a sense, Hawaii itself is a supporting actor and just like the rest of the cast, it carries its weight with flair. While it isn't perfect (there's a certain lack of connection with the audience despite the film's excellence), I walked out of The Descendants under the impression that I had just seen the eventual Best Picture winner and its award aspirations should not end there.Check out my reviews at ieatfilms.com</fullReview>

Honestly I went to see this movie with my entire family and we were all well aware that it was a piece of trash after seeing it. The movie centers around a group of characters so forgettable and weak that you will wish you could have gotten your money back. The only entertaining scenes in this movie where the occasional nature vistas presented in short cuts between melodramatic family dysfunction. Every single time Alexandra, the teenage girl speaks, you can predict a meaningless flurry of rebellion and profanity to erupt from her mouth. The acting is simply terrible, with George Clooney playing an awfully shallow and unlikable character. Honestly I don't understand why he bothered with this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been teaching for almost twenty years now. I believe it's very important to tell kids the truth when they ask policy questions, rationale questions, difficult questions. I offer them what I think the standard, by-the-book answer would be, what I would say personally, and we concentrate on how--or if--my answer and the school's answer match. Most kids appreciate this, and I've found that they more willingly comply to the wishes of their school when they know the rationale.With that said, I love to tell kids that some literature is hideous, but trapped in some works, they can find kernels of truth. They can build more knowledge and skill if they are patient in their reading books like Lord of the Flies, Fahrenheit 451, or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, all murky and verbose, but they contain critical themes kids get.What does this have to do with The Descendants? Well . . .I read several reviews of this movie before I saw it recently. They all praised the movie, but I wanted to see what the big deal was. On a Saturday evening, my wife, daughter, and I sat down to watch this painful, little family drama.And . . . I know how my 9th graders feel, slogging through Lord of the Flies, with several of them saying some version of "I can't get into this!" So, to make things better for them, I spoon-feed some of the darker issues of a society of young boys and younger boys losing their grip on their old world and their basic societal civility. It doesn't always work, but some of my kids begin to see and understand the themes and messages trapped within an annoying book.The Descendants reminded me of being told "It's good for you" by my grandmother, then trying to put the cooked peas in the garbage without anyone noticing. Watching George Clooney try to repair his shattered personal life and relationship with his 19 year old daughter while dealing with the catastrophic injury of his perfidious wife made me think of Fahrenheit 451--a great message hidden in an infuriating book. I knew I was watching something that had garnered a lot of praise over the years, but I couldn't lie to myself. I didn't like the primary or secondary characters, and the story had an ugliness that marred the Hawaiian finish. If a student of mine asked me what I got out of The Descendants, I'd give both the standard, expected answer. Yet, I'd have to throw in my criticism of it. I'd let the kid decide whether or not to see it. It really should be his or her call, not mine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Descendants thrusts us into the life of Matt King (George Clooney), a lawyer and inherited land baron living in Hawaii who must take over the care of his two young daughters after a boating accident leaves his wife in a coma. Matt, the so-called 'back up parent' struggles with his new solo parent duties as he deals with the forced sell of a large area of pristine and unspoiled land passed down to him from several family generations.Alexander Payne is a proved master in telling realistic human stories that showcase superb drama and subtle comedy that never seem to miss a beat as seen in his past films Sideways and About Schmidt. The Descendants is no different. The film has a way of making you laugh, then tear up within seconds.Clooney is a stand out as Matt King revealing hints of overwhelming sadness, but hiding it from his daughters (Woodley &amp; Amara Miller). Woodley, best known for her role on TV's The Secret Life of the American Teenager is a revelation as the wild daughter sent away to private school for drugs. Amara Miller steals several scenes as the youngest daughter Scottie, who finds acting out and text bullying an over weight girl at school as the best way to deal with her mother's condition.Nick Krause, Robert Forster, Matthew Lillard, Beau Bridges &amp; Judy Greer all deliver knock out punches in the tiniest spaces. The Descendants is pitch perfect and should find itself among the Best Picture race this coming Oscar season.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com</fullReview>

My partner cries at the drop of a hat, but this flick didn't move her at all. At no time were we able to empathize with the characters other than a few moments with the young daughter who acted the best out of a bad bunch. And what was the deal with the hanger-on boy, that had no relevance to the story. The side plot of the land sale was so weakly implemented, it had no depth or audience investment at all. Even the scene where the dying woman's father was at her bedside wasn't that good. There are so many better movies of this ilk it's not funny. What a shocker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not terrible, but not excellent either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A story of how a father is thrust into re-connecting with his daughters after a boating accident lands his wife in a coma. It was much better than the trailers had led me to believe. I do try not to watch trailers because over the past 5 years or so it seems that the movie industry has got the idea into their skulls that we, the viewing public, need to have every moment of the film explained to us in a 3 minute trailer! The trailer had a heart-warming, slight comedic sense about it yet the film is nothing of the sort. Sure there are funny moments, which I was glad of, but the film in general is quite sombre; nothing out of the ordinary, nothing spectacular, just a good, solid story with identifiable characters and our leading man, George Clooney, on top form as always but certainly not "the performance of his career" as Empire Magazine would have you believe. I smiled, I laughed, I cried; but then I went downstairs and made myself a cup of tea and moved on to the next film. The Descendants is a film that would have loved to stay in your mind as a tale of family coming together in the most terrible of circumstances, striking triumphant new bonds in the face of emotional adversity but it isn't quite strong enough. It drifts out of your mind just as quickly as the final scene fades to black and the credits roll up. 3/5 not terrible, but not excellent either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming to terms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite what Matt King says, Hawaii does look like a special place. He's not only lucky enough to be living there, but he's from a large successful family (with Hawaiian blood even) that has lived there for generations and has inherited property. Matt King (played by George Clooney) is a true "local". The movie opens with a terrible event: his beautiful and adventurous wife (brilliantly and believably played in her comatose state by Patricia Hastie) has a boating accident. We find out that she will never recover and is close to death. The story is essentially about Matt coming to terms with this frustrating and difficult situation. The plot is focused on his telling their daughters, her parents, their friends, their family and her lover so that they can pay their last respects. The various issues that come up in this situation are explored in the movie. Of course this is a traumatising and life-changing event for Matt and everyone involved.It's a dark, difficult theme, but for most of the movie it's treated with a fairly light hand. Matt is business-like and deadpan about it all mostly, and wants to do the right thing. He seems more upset about her infidelity than anything else.We're shown Matt's world, especially his changing relationship with his daughters. How will Matt and his daughters handle the confrontation with Patricia's lover? Interwoven in this is a subplot about "should we sell out or not?" You see, Matt is a real estate lawyer in Hawaii....The story is about Matt coming personally to terms with his wife's impending death. By the end he has come to know his wife like he never knew her. His goodbye to her was one of the most utterly moving scenes (and most tremendous acting performances) I have ever seen on film. Bring a hankie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, this is the reason I liked it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Alexander Payne is very talented, but he's more inconsistent than the popular opinion would leave one to believe. I've seen all of his films, and still think "About Schmidt" is the best -- "Sideways" was good but I never quite loved it as much as the majority of critics seemed to.The thing about "Descendants" is that, like About Schmidt, it essentially falls back upon one man's performance to elevate the material. And although George Clooney may not be the Robert De Niro of his generation, he's a good enough actor, and here he's pretty much perfect.I've heard a few people complain that "nothing happens" in this movie. That seems to be the biggest issue that reviewers on IMDb have with it, too. I dunno. Sure, nothing per se happens if you're used to big, overblown summer blockbusters...but I enjoyed this movie. A lot. I thought Payne wisely chose Clooney, and Clooney delivered a solid performance. People here seem to get hung up on the Oscars...who cares if it's "Oscar-worthy"? You're gonna judge a movie based on that?? Eh, I dunno...I thought it was a very solid film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Little Step of Clooney Will Be One of Most Iconic Moments of His Career As an Actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I have to warn you that thiz movie is not for everyone. I imagine if you are forty-something people or someone who recently has a relaxing mood, thiz movie could be a surprising one. Me myself, incidentally was in the second category. I went to watch thiz movie with nothing to expect. But you know what? Thiz movie happens to slap me on my face. Big time! Wow? The Actor performances, the landscape, the instrumental music are undoubtedly splendid. The narrative is unusual but gripping. Set in Hawaii, Matt King (George Clooney) a lawyer and land baron grieves his wife, who lies in a coma. Now, King has to reunite his dysfunctional family back together again in thiz difficult situation. His alienated relationship with the two daughters is about to change. Not to mention, He discovers that his wife was having an affair with someone at the time of her accident. At a glimpse, Thiz is difficult story to tell, but simultaneously it has been well executed. The Director is Alexander Payne, the man behind "About Schmidt (2002) and "Sideways" (2004). The teen daughter is played by Shailene Woodley and the younger daughter is played by Amara Miller. Both can bring their characters proportionally. These two characters are central to the story. The success of building the atmosphere depends on these two performers. The supporting Cast members like Nick Krause, Matthew Lilliard, Beau Bridges and others are also in fine condition. Nevertheless, the man who raises thiz drama to another higher level, no other than George Clooney himself! One more time, he can carry his one-man-show brilliantly. Look at his expression and body language in the middle of several awkward situations. How he has to approach his trouble daughter. How he has to react when he finds out his wife's affair. How he has to confront the man who has an affair with his wife. It's so interesting to watch his reaction to deal with the difficult circumstances. The most unforgettable scene would be when he has just discovered his wife affair from his daughter. King spontaneously runs to his relative's house to ask more about the affair. The run is long and by feet, that little step of Clooney will be one of most iconic moments of his career as an Actor. His facial expression is definitely unforgettable.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I found this movie true to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film true to life. Almost every thing a character did appeared to me to be something some person might do. I found myself caring about the characters quickly. There are several turns of the plot, all of them to me feasible. The teenage daughter's actions in her first several scenes are all so credible.Her response when her father accuses her of not respecting authority is wonderful and true to life in the sense that this is how some teenagers would respond. I was pleased that the movie did not over sexualize the teenage daughter to make the movie more enticing as directors often do. I have a doctorate in psychology and sociology. I taught for almost forty years and had a small amount of experience as a co-therapist with a licensed therapist. Saw the movie with a nurse. I double checked several times by asking her whether character's responses to medical situations were ones she had observed. Her answers were "Yes." Our experiences do not mean our judgments are correct. It does mean they are informed. As opposed to many who criticize the movie, I have only two qualms. The daughter's boyfriend seemed to me a little too much of a doofus. The ending is a little pat. Small concerns for what was otherwise a very credible script, exploring issues almost never so realistically explored. Excellent acting. Clooney plays a man whose emotional expression is restricted, whose capacity to interact well with others somewhat limited, but who has integrity and wants to do the right thing. This calls for a restrained performance in which nuances reveal character. to my mind Clooney nails it. As for the viewer who didn't understand why Clooney runs to the house of his wife's friend. He runs there because Clooney's character thinks she knows why his wife did what she did. He also runs awkwardly. A great touch when Clooney could so easily have run athletically.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>487th Review: Oscar nominated? How...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants maybe one of the best films of 2011 according to others, but in a year of dire competition that's not saying much - it really is a maudlin film that takes the viewer nowhere - and we certainly don't feel that it's Oscar worthy.The story of the father whose wife goes into a coma after a boating accident is neither fun, funny, or even dramatic - it just meanders along and we're meant to buy-in and love it. Clooney does himself no favors - sure we all get that it goes against type - but it's just not an Oscar worthy performance. It's not often I feel like I'm going this much against the flow, but really it's a shallow piece of film-making that in any other year would just be glossed over. I don't know what makes me sadder that a soapy negative drama is being praised to the roof or that 2011 has been such a miserable year for film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Payne's best work, but entertaining nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨Goodbye, Elizabeth. Goodbye, my love, my friend, my pain, my joy. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.¨The Descendants is a good film, but I was expecting much more from this dramedy written and directed by Alexander Payne, the man who brought us About Schmidt and Sideways. I was a huge fan of Sideways, and it had been over seven years since Payne directed another movie so I was highly anticipating this one staring George Clooney. Clooney is a great actor and this role seemed perfect for him. After hearing so much buzz from critics and the Academy about this picture, director, and performance from Clooney, my expectations grew even higher. Perhaps it was this over hype that left me a sensation of incompleteness after finishing watching The Descendants. The story was funny, but the characters weren't as interesting as most of Payne's characters were in other movies, and Clooney was great in the lead role, but far from being Oscar worthy in my opinion since I've seen far more better performances from other actors this year. Clooney is a natural and he made his performance actually seem real natural, but I thought relatively unknown Shailene Woodley stole several scenes from him. It's hard not to like someone like Clooney with his charm and charisma, but I don't think that's enough to honor him with another Oscar. He did have one strong scene when he was giving his final farewell speech to his dying wife so don't get me wrong, I did like his performance, I just expected so much more and perhaps those expectations affected my overall perception of the movie. I guess The Descendants actually had me at Payne, Clooney, and Hawaii. It was not as good as I expected, but it was still a lot of fun.George Clooney plays a wealthy land owner from Hawaii named Matt King. His descendants used to be sort of rulers of a big island in Hawaii and therefore he and his family owned most of the land. They are receiving millionairy offers from several businessmen who want to buy the land and build beautiful resorts or shopping malls. Matt however has decided to make a living as a lawyer and spends most of his time in his office. Clooney tells us all this in voice over as he narrates how his wife had a boating accident and has been lying in a coma for the past three weeks. Meanwhile, he has no idea how to raise his nine year old daughter, Scottie (Amara Miller), who has been causing all sorts of trouble in school and at home. Matt decides it's time to go bring his seventeen year old daughter, Alexandra (Shailene Woodley), back from boarding school to help him out with Scottie. Alexandra had a big fight with her mother before the boating accident and is kind of in a rebellious stage, but decides to help out her father after realizing that her mom is not going to get better. Alexandra reveals to Matt that the reason she was fighting with her mom was because she was having an affair with another man, who they later find out to be a real estate businessman named Brian (Matthew Lillard). Alexandra and Matt decide they should find a way to confront him and so they travel to another Hawaiian island where Brian is located. Alexandra brings along one of her friends named Sid (Nick Krause) who practically follows them around everywhere not helping out much, although Matt does seek for their advice most of the time. Payne's film does work solidly as a decent drama with sufficient comedy to lighten up the dark subject matter of the movie. The characters are interesting, although some of the secondary characters are pretty much one dimensional. It's still interesting to see how Clooney's character really doesn't know what he's doing most of the time. He is lost, and looks for his daughter's advice quite often. Most of the comedy comes from Payne's script which is funny as usual, although the cast also help out a lot. I guess since I'm from South America I'm used to seeing a lot of films dealing with society and family dramas since pretty much every Latin film deals with these subject matters, so it wasn't something new for me. Hollywood on the other hand isn't really known for creating these quality dramas so I can see how some of the critics were blown away by this film. But if you consider other foreign films, like this year's Iranian drama A Separation, then you will notice the difference. What Payne does best however is add some comedy into the mix and it always works well for him, although this time I thought it wasn't up to par with his previous film Sideways. The Descendants is a good movie, with some strong performances, but I'd rather watch his previous films before watching this again. The one good thing going for this movie is the beautiful scenery set in Hawaii. I recommend this film, but just don't go into it as hyped as I was because you could be disappointed.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very interesting family drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not know if it was because I have already seen too many "indie" films about normal people trying to overcome family tragedies, but the truth is that it took some time to me to "plunge" myself into the story of The Descendants. It is undoubtedly a solid film with excellent performances, very good direction and a screenplay which offers deep reflections about the marriage, the parental responsibility and even the human nature itself. However, I think that I have already become partially immune to this kind of stories, so I feel like needing something else, something which surpasses the typical family melodrama in order for me to feel that the movie transcended that common cinematographic niche.Director Alexander Payne is accustomed to work with this kind of tragicomedies focused on bizarre situations, simultaneously prosaic and unusual, and based on the unexpected reactions from their characters. Thanks to that narrative strategy, The Descendants works on an unpredictable way, adding sudden humor to sad moments, and surprising us with subtle melancholy on light scenes. Besides, the screenplay possesses that literary quality (maybe as a consequence of being based on a book) which separates it from the classic Hollywood formulas, but without removing the agile and satisfactory structure from a good movie.George Clooney brings an amazing performance in the leading role, leaving his "Hollywood star" image aside in order to be absolutely credible as a common man, who is overwhelmed by the circumstances but enough reasonable in order to overcome them...or at least to try it. I would also like to mention his "daughters" Amara Miller (making an impressive debut) and Shailene Woodley, whose perfect chemistry with each other expresses the classic relationship of affection and exasperation between the sisters. And I think the supporting cast also makes a solid work, highlighting Robert Forster as the main character's stern father-in-law; Judy Greer finally interpreting a character which takes advantage of her big histrionic talent; and Beau Bridges as a hearty cousin.And I also liked the way in which The Descendants captures the lifestyle in Hawaii. As frivolous as that might be, I think that that is the element which made me "plunge" into this film after a while. In conclusion, I would not consider The Descendants an excellent film (mainly because I think that the screenplay includes some forced details), but I enjoyed it pretty much nevertheless, and I can definitely recommend it for those people who like movies which are difficult to classify, but easy to enjoy because of their many attributes. In the context of Payne's filmography, I liked The Descendants more than Citizen Ruth and Sideways, but less than Election and About Schmidt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent intimate drama with some humour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lawyer Matt King (George Clooney) is from a large old Hawaiian family. When his wife ends up in a coma following a power boat accident, Matt ends up having to come to terms with parenting his 10- and 17-year old daughters, both of whom prove to have, let us say, difficult areas to negotiate. At the same time, as Trustee of a family trust, he has to deal with the disposition of a large parcel of valuable land. And then he discovers that his wife was having an affair at the time of the accident. And then it becomes clear that she is not going to come out of the coma...Central to everything is Matt's struggle to come to terms with his personal tragedy, to deal with the needs of his daughters, to do the right thing by his family and his wife's circle of friends, and to seek out his wife's lover to give him the opportunity to pay final respects to her (which, itself has unexpected consequences). The events of this film are small in the overall scheme of things, but large in the lives of the main characters ("characters" is not a fair word - these are people). This is a gentle, adult drama, not without its humorous moments, in which characters do develop, but only to a small extent - rather like real life, in fact. It deals with adult issues, does not come to any glib conclusions, and does so with (occasionally profound) emotion, but never sentimentality.Clooney shows, again, that he is a class act. I don't think this is his best performance, as some are saying (I thought he was better in Ides Of March), but it is an impressive lead performance holding the movie together as Matt copes - not very well, but probably better than I could - with holding things together. He is helped by some excellent supporting performances, notably (as others have pointed out by Shailene Woodley, physically poised on the brink of adulthood, herself coping with the huge secret of her mother's infidelity, and conveying all the strength and fragility of a 17-year old forced into being grown up before she is ready for it.I thoroughly enjoyed this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but unfortunately unsatisfying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was searching for a good film to see last night I saw that this one had some of the highest ratings. So I chose to attend this film. Sadly, after attending the movie I was left wondering why it was so highly rated.I have to give the acting a big thumbs up. The characters were very well portrayed, and the reactions to these situations was well played. I am able to say if these situations were happening to someone in real life that even I would have felt very much like the actors. I may have possibly even reacted the way they did at some points in the film.I just have to say that the film began down a path that became very unsatisfying very early on. This was of no fault of the actors they simply portrayed the characters as if these situations were real, and did quite well at it. Unfortunately, Hollywood is sticking more and more unrealistic combinations together again.The family life portrayal on the big screen is becoming more and more unrealistic as time goes by. The sad thing is that when more people see this behavior played out by big Hollywood titles it slowly creeps it's way into the home.Realistically though I know people from all walks of life and can assure that most of these scenarios are far fetched. Children of 10 years of age using the foulest words known in front of their parent(s) without discipline. A seventeen year old daughter talking like a whore in front of her parent(s). The seventeen year old daughter bringing home her new disrespectful boyfriend to go on vacation with her without previous notification.In real life the ten year old would get put in the quiet room for half an hour per word. The seventeen year old daughter would soon be looking for a new apartment, or stop talking like that in front of the parents and 10 year old. The seventeen year old's boy friend would be beaten half to death by the father, or driven to the nearest gas station to call home for a ride.I could believe the situation with wife to be completely possible in the context of situations this film portrayed. I will add that if any man or woman doesn't show their spouse affection for that long of a period of time then such problems can arise.Again, coming back to reality; hopefully, no one is dumb enough to allow their family to get as distorted as this film portrayed this family. I believe with little effort this entire scenario could be made nonexistent in the world today.I know a wide variety of families from all walks of life. People living in the finest mansions to people living in trailer parks, and rarely have I ever met a family in such a disaster as the one portrayed in this film.I have to rate only 3/10; 3 for the well played characters by the actors. -7 stars due to the incredible lack of realistic family life that is continuously portrayed by these types of films.</fullReview>

Often there is more time showing Hawiian scenery (don't get me wrong, it's beautiful) for transition purposes than action.They could have cut the film by 10 minutes without as much scenery transition.I was also disappointed that there wasn't more back-story on the wife. It would have been a little more interesting to me to see how she felt alienated by her workaholic husband and maybe even what led her to chase the real estate guy. All in all I give a "6" because of the performances.</fullReview>

I still can't decide whether Clooney acted above his acting standards or not, maybe it's his one-dimensional cool persona, that was established after dozens of pretty much similar films, maybe it's his face that can't easily express deeper feelings, but i think these tears he cried didn't seem convincing enough. Anyway, it's a movie that doesn't try hard to awaken emotions, succeeds in keeping an equilibrium between laughs and cries and except for one or two scenes that seemed overblown it was rather fun to watch.

		<fullReview>This is a very good movie with very good acting from especially George Clooney and the rest of the cast. It Is About a Land Baron and a descendant of a very rich queen of Hawaii Matt(Clooney) who tries to take care of his daughters after his wife is in a coma because of a boat accident.The Movie starts showing Matt's Wife getting in a boat accident and Matt having to take care of his 10 year old daughter Scotty. Then it shows how Matt and his cousins are deciding and are keen on selling their land in Hawaii which is worth Millions of dollars. After realizing he cant take care of his stubborn Scotty alone, he decides to bring home his other 17 year old Daughter Alexandra home in order to help him restore peace in the house. After that it shows on how they live and bond together after not being close for many years due to Matt being so busy with all his work, and Matt and his kids also have fun with each other after a long time.George Clooney Gives one of the best performances of his life(at least of the movies I've seen of him) as a father who tries to take care of his daughters in a day to day basis which he has not done before,while also trying to keep himself intact after discovering that his wife was actually cheating on him and also trying to get over his wife's death. The rest of the crew also does a good job, specially Matt's two daughters Alexandra(Woodley) and Scotty(Amara). Also well done by the rest of the crew, specially Alex's friend sid and Matt's cousins. Very Well Directed by Alexander Payne, of whom before this i had only seen one movie, Payne does an excellent job in making these young actors perform so well, and also making Clooney give one of his best performances of his life. He also shows some nice comedy in the middle of this tough life of Matt, and also shows some breathtaking scenery throughout the movie.Good Cinematography in the movie, with some scenes of Hawaii in the movie being breathtaking. Very Well Written story also by the writer of the actual Novel,who shows us that we can also find happiness in our life while going through tough times. Good Background music throughout the movie,i think actual Hawaiin Songs were played throughout the movies. Finally, i think the movie is a very well made film by Payne, is quite enjoyable with some comedic scenes in it, and does deserve some awards.It will be tough this time to tell who wins the Best Picture awards in the Oscars with all these good movies releasing in the same year, although I think it will be this movie, the help or the Artist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hawaain Look at Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Alexander Payne's The Descendants is a star vehicle for George Clooney. Here Clooney portrays a Hawaiin father who must deal with pulling the plug on his wife in acoma whilst trying to learn how to take care of his two daughters and learning at the same time his wife was having an affair. All just peachy. The brilliance of Clooney's performance shines in his ability to make the transitions from his character, Matt King's dealings with his wife dying and caring for his daughters to him hunting for the man his wife was seeing on the side. By handling these transitions so deftly, Clooney and Payne manage to evoke humor and pathos in these moments, just as it very often emerges in real life, and it is always believable. It can be seen in Clooney's eyes when a line or action triggers his change in emotion, such as when he follows the man home and learns that he has a wife and kids, there is a noticeable reaction due to this visual trigger. Of course, Clooney gets stellar support from the acting ensemble, in particular his potty-mouthed seventeen-year-old, played authentically by Shailene Woodley. While the resolution drags, resolving the major conflicts a touch too early, the emotions on display here are so real that Alexander Payne's deglamorization of the Hawaain lifestyle never fails to keep one watching.I give The Descendants a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like to book on which it was based, this movie does'nt follow the usual plot lines. Adventure movie fans would say it's about nothing, but it really sucks you in. Clooney is, as many other reviewers have said, excellent. It's amazing how much he can convey in even small facial gestures.I read the book before I saw the movie. The movie does simplify and telegraph the plot somewhat compared to the book and alters the focus away from the family to the larger land sale arc. However, it did seem to be a good dramatization. The movie - including the sets that were very nice but cluttered - kept the book's picture of real people - married people who shout at each other, children who screw up.One disappointment was the band at Cousin Hugh's bar. In the book, the ukulele club - old men - meet at the bar to play. In the movie, it just looks like an ordinary house band in a small club.- Spoiler Alert- In the movie, Matt's wife has actively campaigned with his cousins for the bid that would enrich her lover. This wasn't in the movie. Actually, she's not that nice a lady in the book, before that. I sort of like the way the book ended, with Scotty saying her mother was under her fingernails, referring to her ashes, and her father drawing a lesson from that. I guess it was too outre even for this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney has never been better, Shailene Woodley displays poise and depth beyond her years, and I can't say enough about Robert Forster, Judy Greer, Nick Krause, and even the typically dorky Matthew Lillard.Thankfully, the terrific acting helps distract from an implausible plot that frequently goes so far off the map that it falls off the edge altogether.I found it difficult to believe that Woodley's out of control, bitter character would come around so quickly and easily. I didn't buy that Clooney would allow Woodley's dim-bulb boyfriend to tag along with the rest of the family on their journey. And I struggled to accept that the clan would go to such lengths just to make contact with mom's secret lover.Still, there are some utterly awesome acting moments, most of them so quiet, yet so powerful, that make this movie worth seeing - Robert Forster looking off in the distance, struggling to hold it together when he realizes he's going to lose his daughter; Nick Krause showing sadness and vulnerability with just a faint smile as he tells Clooney about his own father's passing; and Clooney's heart wrenching final goodbye to his wife as tears glide down his face.Payne got 120% from his actors in this production. It's a shame he couldn't have crafted a script that gave the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed Motives Permeate Decisions Made in "The Descendants"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing new appears in the plot department in "The Descendants". For the umpteenth time, we have a successful, workaholic father (George Clooney as Matt King) juggling three problems: 1) attempting to be more "parental" with older, estranged, profane daughter Alex (Shailene Woodley) and uninhibited younger daughter Scottie (Amara Miller), 2)monitoring the comatose, near-death state of his adventurous wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie), and 3) as trustee pondering how to dispose of prime Hawaii seafront real estate: sell it and make many family beneficiaries obscenely rich or preserve its pristine beauty. As you can see, Matt's plate is overflowing. The movie is about how Matt methodically and gradually addresses his three problems. To some degree, "The Descendants" is ultimately predictable. However, what is novel is the theme that we almost never act from purely noble, altruistic motives. In the decisions Matt makes, he simultaneously shows concern and exasperation, control and vengeance, reconciliation and resentment.For example, as he tries to reestablish a connection with Alex, Matt is fumblingly, hilariously, and sadly ineffective. That is, until he learns that his wife was having a clandestine affair. Matt, of course, is fiercely determined to ferret out the slime who cuckolded him. Perked up by the prospect of this juicy, scandalous mystery, Alex slowly drops her "sullen teen" facade and eagerly helps her dad discover that a Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard), a real-estate broker, is responsible. They grudgingly get closerAs another example, Matt finally confronts Brian at his rented seaside cottage about the affair. But instead of getting into a spirited fistfight that would shatter the lawyer's reputation, Matt quietly but determinedly interrogates Brian about his tryst with Elizabeth and informs him about Elizabeth's tragic state. Again, Matt's logical way of handling this seems more humane, but it is also more searingly effective in wounding and humbling Brian, and eventually his wife Julie (Judy Greer), to whom he confesses. It also exposes Brian for the cowardly louse he is, since he refuses to visit Elizabeth on her sick/death bed and sends his wife instead.Matt displays his ulterior motives regarding the land sale. With his family members, he views the breathtaking property and realizes it would be commercially vile to condemn it to condo development. Therefore, he gathers the cousin beneficiaries together to tell them that he will not sign the land over to developers. But his new-found environmentalism is not the only reason for Matt's decision. He also doesn't want the idle cousins, who never cared for the land in any way and only acquired it through descent, to profit. But Brian, coincidentally, was orchestrating the deal, and Matt REALLY doesn't want HIM to profit.As the final example, Matt discontinues life support for his wife when the doctors tell him that her head trauma from a boating accident will eventually doomed her. Of course, this is an obvious act of charity and a concession to her "Do Not Resuscitate" issues. However, it also gives the all-too-human Matt, his daughters, and his in-laws the chance to vent about her flaws and failures and infidelities without her actually hearing it. The venting, however, eases Matt's reconciliation with his wife, and makes the post-cremation ash-scattering into the ocean that much easier.To make peace with the world, we must sort out our mixed selfish and not-so-selfish feelings as we stumble towards some kind of resolution. Even when we make the "right" decisions, we often do so for at least partially "wrong" reasons. Matt and company learn this anguished and sobering lesson in "The Descendants"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this film an "8", which for me is a high rating, for 3 reasons: 1. George Clooney's superb performance; 2. Shailene Woodley's surprisingly strong performance; 3. This film IS different.And it's that last point that I want to begin with. First of all, the setting. As I sat watching the film it occurred to me how few films are made in Hawaii. And it isn't just the lush setting that's attractive here. The setting was a key to the attitude of the characters in the film. Not to mention that a key facet of the plot is Hawaiian history. So, for numerous reasons, Hawaii was the perfect -- and different -- setting for this film. And the plot is "different", as well. Clooney is the somewhat absent husband whose wife is severely injured in a boating accident. Turns out she is dying, and he has to begin actively caring for his two daughters...not the most charming children on the planet...who nonetheless turn out to have some real character. But as he deals with his older daughter's drug and behavioral issues, he learns that his wife was having an affair. He and his daughter set out to confront the "other man", and what unfolds is a rather charming story, with enough humor not to make it maudlin, which it could have been.George Clooney is superb, and I say that as a moviegoer who didn't care for him in his television years, and have only sort of begrudgingly been won over in his Hollywood years. With this performance, for me, he has sealed the deal. I was somewhat reminded of the understated film performances of Spence Tracy.I had never heard of Shailene Woodley, but wow! What a wonderful young actress, especially since in the beginning of the film you are prepared not to like her character at all since she is a drug-troubled teen. But, with time, she transforms the character into a very interesting and strong-minded young lady. Other characters are well-played. I was disappointed in the role and performance of Beau Bridges...a long-time favorite of mine. Nothing special in his performance here.Excellent film, well-wroth going to the theater to see, and will end up on my DVD shelf!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is simply, in my opinion, an EXCELLENT film. Yet again George Clooney executes a difficult role with depth, compassion and an entire panoply of emotion that the script dictates. The film was gripping, heart wrenching and tragic as the web families weave has grave emotional consequences. Clooney is at his best when he has much going on internally but but does not necessarily exhibit it externally. It seems to be characteristic of many of his roles. He is riveting.I was not sure at first if Patricia Hastie, who plays George Clooney's comatose wife and has no dialogue, was a manikin since she plays, what must have been one of the most difficult roles in film and Oscar worthy as best supporting actress, with utter credulity. It truly is an amazingly realistic performance.I cannot say anything was amiss in this film except that I thought the crucial meeting between Clooney and Brian Spear's wife was surprising if not in part questionable. Still, it was necessary to the film's content. I give this film a decided thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can you miss with a movie having the back drop of Hawaii?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney &amp; Shailene Woodley are excellent in this film. Amara Miller (Scotty King) does steal a few scenes though. The story is based on a family's tragedy &amp; conflict; the exposure to public view. The mother of the family has suffered a major injury, rendering her to a coma. The family self reflects &amp; comes together on the tragedy. There is a back story to the underlining guilt of the protagonists in the story. It is their quest to find answers &amp; confront them, which is the fuel to it. The self guilt &amp; the little bit of evil that lie in each of the characters does well in the development of this story. The direction of photography &amp; the music accentuate the story almost flawless.I liked the story line. It flowed smoothly &amp; was clear. The hype to the film is that George Clooney should get at least a nomination for his performance? But if I were to weigh in, Shailene Woodley (Alexandra King) should be a shoe in for the supporting roll. She shined in this film &amp; should be recognized for her performance. And I should add, the filming was excellent also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The softer side of George Clooney....Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big George Clooney fan...I probably fell in love when he was in OR scrubs as Dr. Ross on ER. His film career has spanned the adventuresome 'pretty boy'in the Ocean's series; some out of the ordinary 'comedies'(Burn after reading, O Brother where art thou and Men Who Stare at Goats) and some more serious movies like Michael Clayton and Up in the Air. But none prepared me for seeing my George in such a vulnerable role. Oh sure, he had the money and good lucks we've come to expect but in The Descendants he was blindsided and watched his life spiral away from him at break neck speed. Shailene Woodley as his oldest, somewhat out of control, daughter plays him like a harp...angry, eye rolling, shoulder shrugging teen one moment then warm, compassionate and supportive to her dad Matt King a few scenes later. George is coming of age...he is 50 yrs old, with more gray hair and he's not afraid to age with dignity. Matt King doesn't have all the answers...in fact, he doesn't know the questions. My favourite line (spoiler alert) was when he confronted his wife's lover and, always the gentleman, said 'Elizabeth is dying....no wait. F**K YOU!...oh, and Elizabeth's dying'. I went Hurrah! He's got a spine after all as we had watched Matt stalk Brian Speers but not confront him. As painful as it was to watch Matt get angry then watch him methodically confront the 'other man', the life lesson here is 'yes Virginia...it is hard to confront our demons but healing can't begin until you stare your enemy in the face'. George not only met his demons, he did with force, strength but always with a good dose of class. He even produced a tear on cue. This is an Academy award winner for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another good Payne!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Dependents" is the movie about a single man in his mid- 40's who is deep in trouble with the IRS so he hires an obese mother and two cranky teenagers to be his dependents so he can collect more cash from Uncle Sam. OK, this is totally erroneous and false. But it wouldn't be a bad idea? Or maybe it would be. I am here to really review a good idea on film called "The Descendants". Writer-Director Alexander Payne's latest cinematic offering is worth all the accolades it has been receiving, even though "Election" and "Sideways" continue to be my favorite two movies of Alexander the Great. "The Descendants" stars George Clooney as Matt King, a wealthy Hawaiian lawyer whose wife is in a coma from a boating accident. Due to that unforeseen circumstance, Matt now has to be the parental king of his two daughters, 17-year old feisty teen Alexandra and insubordinate 10-year old Scottie. Matt is also in the process of selling a gargantuan amount of Hawaiian land that was owned by his ancestors and has been handed down from generation to generation throughout the years; Matt is the main proprietor of the land even though his King cousin clan are also involved in the selling. If they sell the land, they would make so much dough that they definitely will be kings for more than just one day. But the real Matt volcano eruption of "The Descendants" is when Matt is made aware by Alexandra that his wife was having an affair with another man. Payne is infamous in featuring a conflicted middle-age male protagonist as the centerpiece of his film's narratives. And in "The Descendants", Matt King is exactly that. Payne directed the movie with an easygoing pace which was delightful to watch even though the film deals with such an emotional distressing situation. Payne co-scripted the film's screenplay with Nat Faxon, and it was a very engaging one I must say. But a great Payne screenplay is usually a sure thing. Clooney has never been better, there are dimensions to his acting that have never been witnessed before on screen; not even in his great performance in "The Dumpster". O wait, he never acted in that movie, that is actually based on his personal life. You don't believe me- google Sarah Larson, Elisabetta Canalis, Lisa Snowdon, etc. etc. etc. Sorry George! Please don't sue me, or else I am going to have to find me "The Defendants". Anyways, Clooney's king performance as King should garner him a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar nomination. Also great was Shailene Woodley as Alexandra; Woodley you know it, this newcomer might also get an Oscar nomination for her strong supportive work. There were also brilliant supporting performances from Robert Forster as Matt's stubborn father-in-law Scott Thorson, and from Beau Bridges as Matt's easygoing but financially-determined cousin Hugh. Matthew Lillard appears in only one scene but he made the most of his limited screen time as Brian Speer, the man who had been speering Matt's wife. Ouch! Judy Greer, who has been stereotyped by portraying a female protagonist's supportive friend throughout her career, showed that it is time to give Ms. Greer a staring role; she was stupendous as Speer's wife Julie. However, the scene-stealer of "The Descendants" was undoubtedly Nick Krause whose performance as Sid, the feeble-minded teen friend of Alexandra who comes along for the ride, was a sure delight to an otherwise melancholy film. But not even Krause or Clooney gave the best performance of "The Descendants". That distinction would go to the state of Hawaii, whose ambiance and aura played key factors in the film's success and juxtaposed its narrative progression. Not many feel the "The Descendants" will descend to being snubbed for Oscar nominations. I am also in that school of thought. I did not like it as much as other critics or pseudo-critics (which is what I really am, OK now I need to go for "the depressants") did, but it is still another Payne piece that is definitely worth the ride. Aloha! **** Good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really, really great film......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants (2011) I walked out of the film "The Descendants" hoping that my fellow movie goers could not see that my face was completely tear stained and red. I think when you look up the term "tear jerker" in the dictionary (is that term actually IN the dictionary? Must check, later) - there would be a photo of the either the movie poster for this film or maybe just a close up of George Clooney's eyes. And, what beautiful, windows to the soul those eyes are! But, I get ahead of myself.Set in Hawaii, "The Descendants" is a film about a man forced to make some major decisions. Decisions regarding property, decisions regarding his children, decisions regarding life. The film begins right smack dab in the middle. Matt King (George Clooney) is a married, father of two girls. His wife, Elizabeth, has been in a serious boating accident and is lying in the hospital in a coma. Matt, a lawyer by trade, has been thrust into becoming the main care taker for his youngest daughter, Scottie (Amarilla Miller). Very early in the film, Matt is informed that his wife's condition is irreversible and he must make the decision to remove her from life support.At the same time, Matt is the partial owner (along with many, many cousins) of a considerable amount of land on the Island of Kawaii. Matt and his cousins are descendants of King Kamehameha and this enormous and gorgeous piece of land has been trusted to them. Matt has the responsibility of making the final decision regarding the sale of this land, which has personal, legal, financial, and political implications.Matt and Scottie travel in the middle of the night to the big island of Hawaii to retrieve his eldest daughter, Alex (Shailene Woodley) who has been away at college. It becomes very obvious that Alex has some behavioral issues as she is found, not in her dorm room, but out on the beach with a girlfriend, obviously intoxicated. Back at home, Matt reveals to Alex the seriousness of his wife's condition. It is revealed that Alex and her mother had some "issues" and had not been getting along prior to the accident. Alex then reveals to Matt the cause of their quarrel. Elizabeth had been having an affair. The look of disbelief, hurt, anger, and sadness that pervades Matt's face (through George Clooney's eyes) was truly amazing. Both George Clooney and Shailene Woodley created a scene that was both honest and heartbreaking.The film follows the next few days in Matt's life - as he makes these difficult, but necessary, decisions - while, at the same time searches out his wife's lover. Along the way, he navigates through informing his in-laws of their daughter's impending death, negotiations with his cousins on the property sale, dealing with his daughters' grief, as well as his own.The performances were superb. Most notable (in addition to Clooney and Woodley) were Robert Forster as Matt's father in law and Nick Krause as Alex's boyfriend Sid, who shows that even a shaggy haired pot head has some depth beneath the surface.All in all, a very, very good film. Be prepared. This is not a "fun" film. It is depressing, dark, and sad. Bring some tissues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very human</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne, director of "Sideways" and "About Schmidt," does an excellent job of portraying very human conditions, reactions and conflicts; "Descendants" is no exception. "Matt" (Clooney) is a lawyer and he--along with 15-20 cousins--are descendants of one of Hawaii's royalty and thus sole heirs to inherit 26,000 acres of unspoiled, beautiful Hawaiian coastal land which developers covet. It's up to Matt to decide whether to keep it in trust or to sell it and reap millions. At the same time, Matt is faced with having to suddenly begin parenting his two daughters, 17 &amp; 10, during his wife's recent hospitalization; she remains unconscious after suffering severe brain trauma in a boating accident. She may not survive. Matt's oldest daughter ("Alex," Woodley) comes equipped with a boyfriend, a beginning separation from her family, and adult experimentation. Alex recently became distant from her mother after discovering her Mom was in an ongoing relation with a lover; her father was unaware of this deceit until Alex told him after her mother's injury. The unconscious, hospitalized wife-mother has a mother with Alzheimer's and an edgy father who blames Matt for not having been more generous to his daughter -- as if that would have avoided her dreadful injury. "Descendants" has a rich mixture of family/relational discord and dynamics leading to an outcome that very skilled marriage &amp; family therapists could be proud to help a family achieve. Those who aren't that interested in family dynamics may wonder what this movie's hype is about, while for those of us who are, we find it a very captivating tale, well cast and well acted.Roger Ebert notes that "Descendants" gets classed as a "comedy" because it ends happily. BUT, up to that point, we have many relational conflicts--and pathos--and ultimately growth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another of Alexander Payne's lost men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne is obviously drawn to material that features middle aged men who have lost their bearings: Schmidt, Jim McAllister, Miles and Jack, all are men who have lost sight of any meaning or direction in their lives. To that roster one may safely add the hero of this movie, real estate lawyer and descendant of Hawai'ian royalty Matt King. Matt has his head so far into his legal practice that his life has become unmoored; his wife, who has been reduced to a coma in a boating accident, has been having an affair with a prominent realtor, his ten year-old daughter has been bullying her schoolmates and generally throwing her weight around, his 17 year-old daughter has what might be described as an Elektra Complex, and, despite being sole trustee of his family's Kauai landholdings, he seems content to allow his gaggle of cousins to determine the fate of the paradisiacal property. When he berates his daughters for not respecting authority, it causes the biggest laugh of the entire film: there is no authority there.Fortunately for everyone involved, Matt is able, with the not inconsiderable help of his teen-aged daughter, to weather his crises, and emerges at the end as someone who will make a good father, and will be a steward for the land. George Clooney makes this transformation believable, and he is ably supported by the entire cast, and by Alexander Payne's direction; Payne always seems to summon solid performances from his entire casts.</fullReview>

The whole movie is shot in Hawaii. Some of the beautiful scenes felt like a travel documentary. George Clooney and Shailene Woodley as father and daughter Alex are terrific. Nick Krause as Sid the cool friend of Alex is very pleasant and behaves like a typical teenager. Family dynamics are well done. Just needed 10-15 minute travel documentary editing.

		<shortDescription>About Matt King...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne is a director who has done four very good films...About Schmidt, Sideways, Election, and the little known Citizen Ruth. Add The Descendants to that list. The Descendants is a film about a man named Matt King (George Clooney), a man living in Hawaii whose business happens to be very successful. After his wife, who he has been supposedly very distant with gets in a boating accident, Matt has to take care of his daughters. Thus begins yet another very realistic film from director Payne. The Descendants is touching and well acted, but rarely ever funny, and that's a good thing. The seriousness of this film is really what works. Sure, Sid, daughter Alexandria's friend has some very funny moments, but even he's a serious, complex character. Payne does a good job here of taking all the actors, veterans or newcomers, and getting them to shine. Also, as with his other four films, Payne shows a real life situation and shows us what happens in everyday life. Clooney is great here, tugging at our heartstrings and touching us without going over the top. Also, actors like Shailene Woodley and Nick Krause, who are not used to being the dramatic types are excellent here. All that's left to say is see The Descendants..it's not a perfect film, but it's a really good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scaling the Hawaiian country-side with tears and laughter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Descendants" is set in Hawaii but Matt King (George Clooney) and his family are not on vacation. Far from it. King is actually in a line descended down from an old Hawaiian princess and has inherited a wealth of land. That's only the secondary the plot. The primary plot is that his wife is in a coma and he has to learn how to be a parent to his two unruly daughters. Cue the laugh track.Somehow, appropriately, it is very funny. In a feel-good sort of way, not in a slapstick kind of way. Also surprisingly, and contrary to popular belief, it does have a direction and aim. The end point is pretty vague, our hero just has to find a way to live life the best he can. But to get to that end, it doesn't actually meander. Matt King has specific obstacles which he has to overcome. Namely, retrieving his 17 year-old daughter from boarding school, convincing his 10 year-old daughter to not wear her older sister's underwear, and most importantly, finding and confronting the real estate agent that was having an affair with his wife.George Clooney looks like himself but a little more down-to-Earth and a little more down-trodden than usual. He makes you care for him and the laughs and bitter-sweet tears come easily. Just as appealing was Shailene Woodley as his 17 year-old daughter. She was the snarky, rebellious teenager, but with a warmth and understanding that made you realize it came from love and not born from Hollywood cliché.Alexander Payne has written, directed and produced a number of excellent films beginning with "Citizen Ruth" (1996) and "Election" (1999), and continuing here, 'The Descendants" is a well written, well directed and well made film. I could end this review with the prosaic line that you will find tears and laughter on the way to meeting 'The Descendants"; however, this really isn't a prosaic film even if it does seem like one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming, clever and often rather touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's long-awaited The Descendants is a touching portrait of relationships and the obstacles in their way, how difficult it can be to connect with those closest to us, the fear of conveying emotion, how others act as mirrors for us to understand and express ourselves.The Descendants begins with an unfortunately long voice-over from our protagonist, Matt King (George Clooney). His wife, Elizabeth, has suffered head trauma and is hospitalized with a coma. Matt is dealt blow after blow when he learns that she was cheating on him up until her accident. He gathers his daughters (Amara Miller and Shailene Woodley) and sets out on a literal and emotional journey to inform their friends of Elizabeth's condition and to track down her partner.Alexander Payne's directorial style is present here in his reliance on narration and awkwardly funny, "am I allowed to laugh?" tone. Unfortunately, the story and the characters are so personal, it's as if Payne gets in the way at times. His attempts to make The Descendants more authentically Hawaiian, notably through the use of indigenous music, feel gimmicky rather than natural and jolt the audience out of what is otherwise a thoroughly engrossing and gripping journey. Payne has a habit of using narration to great effect, but here it's unnecessary and uninteresting: in spite of a couple witty one-liners, most of the narration (done by Clooney's character) is redundant and out of character. All we need to know is already in the film, rendering the opening monologue especially useless, and while Matt is portrayed as private and emotionally distant, we are constantly interrupted with his life story. Clooney may have the perfect voice for narration but even that isn't enough to cover up its obtrusiveness.Apart from Payne's sometimes intrusive direction, though, it's a great film, one that's helped by an outstanding screenplay and incredibly natural performances. The editing leaves something to be desired, as The Descendants takes much too long to set everything up and many scenes feel awkward and irrelevant; however, the writing is strong enough to keep an audience interested. The success of the film depends on whether the family at the film's core is convincingly loving, yet grating and distant, and on that front, the film excels - the characters are wonderfully written, and we get a strong sense of their histories, idiosyncrasies, and dynamic. Payne and his co-writers find the humor in confrontation: his characters are at their worst, but funniest, when fighting. It takes a talented writer to create comedy from earnestness, and the Oscar buzz for The Descendants' screenplay is well-deserved.In a movie that focuses so intently on just a few characters and not much plot, a lot of pressure is put on the actors. Clooney and Woodley in particular exceed expectations, both bringing so much depth to their respective characters and playing off each other to create a hilarious, but raw, emotional, and above all realistic father-daughter relationship. Clooney is at his best here, doing a wonderful job of expressing a deeply internal conflict: he creates an aura of emotional distance, but quietly makes it clear that he is struggling to remain composed in the face of so many emotional blows. His performance is extraordinarily nuanced, and he brings so much meaning and significance to something as trivial as a hand motion, or a quick glance. Clooney is meticulous and powerful, letting the tiniest change in body language signal a huge emotional shift.Shailene Woodley, however, is the star of the film. Her performance here (which, by the way, is sure to attract major awards attention) is wildly different from the tragedy that is The Secret Life of the American Teenager, but under a director of Payne's caliber she shows huge promise. Clooney's performance is undoubtedly one of his best, but his Matt is so restrained and aloof - the emotional power of certain scenes might not have been expressed if Woodley wasn't there to do it. She delivers pure, raw, unadulterated feeling, and does it so naturally and intuitively. Alexandra is spelled out in the screenplay as potty- mouthed, irreverent, and carefree, but Woodley defines her so much more distinctly, more definitively. She fleshes her out into a full person, and therefore contributes so much to the family dynamic that is the center of the film. It may be Payne's first, however small, directorial misfire, but The Descendants nevertheless is a charming, moving, often hilarious film firmly built on a fantastic screenplay and actors who fully inhabit their roles. We learn, grow, laugh, and cry with them as they travel the distance not only between islands, as they search for friends and enemies (look for a heartbreaking cameo from Judy Greer), but the distance between each other as well. Payne's direction gets in the way sometimes, but The Descendants is a journey worth taking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Clooney Does it Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney is the leading man, this time playing Hawaiian attorney Matt King in Alexander Payne's The Descendants. Matt is financially successful. He's an heir to many acres of pristine undeveloped beach land. He can jet across Hawaii at a moments' notice. But he's also in a troubled marriage, out of touch with his two daughters. He's the self proclaimed "back-up" parent. He broods. He becomes passionate when he finds out about his wife's infidelity. Sadly, he is not so passionate about the lives of his daughters, or for his wife who has fallen into a coma, heading towards certain death. Instead of dealing with his wife's tragedy or daughter's needs, he drags the girls across Hawaii so he can play the game of Strong Manly Man confronts Wife's Evil Adulterer Lover.In more capable hands, this set up could be extremely comic, tragic and moving on many levels (Love Liza is a great example of a successful comic family tragedy). However, this script and Payne's work fall flat, introducing a weak cliché subplot while missing other boats of possibilities for comedy and dramatized family relations. Payne is a worthy director, but this was a bad day at the office.King's oldest daughter Alex, 17, played by Shailene Woodley, appears as the troublemaker in her first scene. Alex is a typical confrontational teenager, and Woodley's acting is a shining light in this film, showing refreshing charismatic skill that is beautiful and energetic. She's strong opposition to King's pathetic weakness. Problem #1 is the male emasculation theme, which was funny for awhile in the late 90's but that field's been harvested down to dead sticks. The Descendants hacks away at it here, which in 2012 is annoying and eye roll inducing.The film does not adequately explain the daughters' quick turnaround from being neglected and estranged from their father to happily bonding over ice cream and television. Matt and Alex are angry because of the infidelity, but the script oddly avoids any introspection into the status of the King's marriage, why cheating occurred, or why Matt does not have a close relationship with his daughters. Matt appears not to know much about them, and shows little interest in their own lives and passions - to film's end.The Hawaiian backdrop to The descendants is beautiful, as is the musical score of wonderful ukulele Hawaiian music. These are welcome sidetracks for the eyes and ears, where other beauty is lacking.I root for George Clooney. I want him to surprise me, to be a good actor. But his face is blank. Anger is expressed as two dimensional confident aggression. His sadness is not convincing. He seems disconnected from his body, and does not use it to enhance his performances. There's little warmth or human subtlety or artistic energy. Clooney doesn't act, he caters to his public - maintaining big brown puppy dog eye contact, rarely blinking or looking away. He avoids getting lost in roles, letting go, being truly broken or despairing; things that draw compassion and interest from audiences, things that other lead male actors do as a matter of course. Others would have torn this role up with comedic tragedy or emotional drama, using skills Clooney lacks (Mark Ruffalo, Viggo Mortensen, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bill Murray, Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, James Franco, Hugh Grant - no joke, in a UK version he'd be good, really funny.) I get it. There are millions in the "he's dreamy" Church of George Clooney. I am not one. I think he is without charm while also eminently, unattractively confident in himself. He seems physically strong, but is not athletically graceful. He insists with the excessive eye contact as if he were still a handsome, doe-eyed 25 year old, but now he just looks like an old guy staring you down. In The Descendants, Clooney's gait is like an old man with hip problems, and it distracted me into worrying about his health. He's akin to Charlie Sheen, Sean Penn, and movie stars from the 50's whose voices expose their excessive vices.Sadly, the potential for Clooney to bring a well-needed spark of life to The Descendants was as unlikely as becoming so mesmerized by a Clooney performance that you forget you're watching George Clooney.If you're a member of the CGC, ignore this review and grab the popcorn. You will LOVE The Descendants. For you, I score it a 10. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found more to enjoy in this movie than to dislike. I've always been able to take or leave George Clooney so that I have seen perhaps half of the films in which he has appeared but this time he showed definite signs of actually acting rather than relying on looks and charm. Alas, the film promises more than it delivers as if director Payne was saying to the audience 'sure, we meant to explore the issues of moral compasses but somehow between pre-production and shooting we mislaid our own. Shailene Woodley has rightly been praised for her performance but it seems that her volte face from angry, sullen, rebellious teenager to mature father-supporter is too abrupt and could have used a tad more finesse. I certainly enjoyed it and was moved to tears once or twice whilst watching it but I'm not sure it would stand further viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film explains "what do you do?" Matt has to come to terms with the issues that have been simmering below the surface, deal with them and reconnect with his daughters. I'm not a big Clooney fan, but he does a great job. It's not sappy sweet but honest. Robert Forster's character adds a nice punch (pun intended). It was cool to see Michael Ontkean, but he doesn't say anything which I thought was a little odd.I did have a couple of problems with this film. Here is a family with a long history of living in Hawaii, but at the family gathering, I found it hard to believe that none of the cousins married any Hawaiians. Most were all pretty pasty and pale too. I also felt that as bohemian as Beau Bridges looked, why didn't he speak a little pidgin English. But it was great that Matt didn't come off as a greedy haole.Overall, a great film to watch...worthy of a DVD buy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Didn't Connect with This Material, but Good Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I assure you I have enough tragedy in my life to match or best this film's theme, but I couldn't feel anything for the characters. I wanted Matt (Clooney) to get a "win" in, amongst his tragic and overwhelming circumstances - but that's about all the passion I could muster. I welled up in the right scene, but I left the theatre feeling unmoved. The characters never felt real. The actors conveyed the material beyond what was really there, but for me that didn't rescue the film. For the record, Clooney in Michael Clayton was nothing short of perfection. "Up in the Air" very emotional and real. Big ups to Judy Greer the skilled character actress who kills it in everything she's in. Her performance in this as Julie Speer is no exception, but again, her big scene plays like the production minimized it rather than amplified it. For those who got something out of the film, glad you did. But had to speak for the minority.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alexander Payne has given us strong story telling before, going deep into the various shadings of human relationships. He reaches, explores, and delivers, usually with the help of very talented people (Giamatti, Witherspoon, Clooney). Here in "The Immortals" is the tale of a father and his family, trying to make peace with two major conflicts in his life; somehow he pulls everything together, but he discovers life will probably never be the same, as long as he accepts some deals along the way.Matt (Clooney) must make two important decisions soon: he has to see the extent of his wife's health decay, and he must act on some legalities involving some prime real estate property in Kauai. In his journey to the resolution of his problems, he must find a way to mend his relationship with is daughters. Here we run into a couple of bumpy stretches, as the younger actress overplays her role a bit and threatens to lessen the impact of the scenes. Clooney manages to save this section of the movie in spite of the way her daughter's role is portrayed. It is much more subtle in the book.Later on, it's not hard to be distracted by his older daughter's facial profile, which brings to mind Portman, an actress whose range is no match for the lovely Shallene Woodley. Portman manages to portray different types of upset with a look that resembles some type of physical discomfort. Woodley broadcasts an amazing range of emotions with a look. She doesn't resort to histrionics or overacting. There are some key scenes where her father meets the man who had apparently derailed his marriage, and she embodies complete charm with a dark twist as the must clear the way for his father's meeting with his dying wife's lover. She is also amazingly warm in her portrayal of the protective sister, a real demonstration of an older teen's age and frustration trying to love her younger sibling.Talking about great acting, the man of the hour is Clooney. His Matt is complex, vulnerable, strong, resilient, and on the brink of a breakdown, but his nature is also that of a survivor, and many will wonder whether his wife's past affairs affect his ultimate decision, or whether he is really looking at the future through his appreciation of history and ecology. Whatever the choice is, one can't help appreciate the work of the supporting cast, with Bridges showing the cold heart of the greedy investor and Robert Foster, as his father-in-law giving us the perspective of the grieving family. Still, everything revolves around Clooney's hurt and his affecting performance. He bares the character's soul, looking at us through an understanding of what love and pain can do to you in moments like these. He shows love, sorrow, hurt, jealousy, sadness, loss, and even happiness at various times. It's a winning performance.While watching the film, I couldn't help connecting it to other classics, such as the masterful "Terms of Endearment", another film whose impact was lessened by an interesting musical score. Here, there was potential for further damage with a very intrusive vocals by a Hawaiian performer. Where the acting is so powerful because of its restraint, the opposite happens, as we almost start sinking into travel mode, as we see repeated views of the lovely Hawaiian landscape. True, we need to weigh the impact of the surroundings in Matt's world and decision making moments, but the vocals are a bit too much, and they muddle the emotions, as we keep wondering when and where the luau and the fire dancers are.Other than that, less is more in Payne's direction and narrative. Simple moments in the hospital rooms are powerful stuff. Exchanges between father and daughter, father and father, man and romantic rival speak volumes, louder and better than any thematic music could do. One can only hope the DVD edition keeps it simple, remembering that less is sometimes way more than we can hope for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trouble in Paradise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Alexander Payne's newest opus to the human condition hits familiar territory from his previous work in "About Schmidt" and "Sideways." But unlike his earlier outings he wisely removes his signature savage satire to tell a remarkably simple story with a lot of heart.The film begins with lawyer Matt King (George Clooney) who has a lot on his plate. After an unfortunate boating accident, King's wife has fallen into a deteriorating coma to which the doctors say she will never wake up. King then brings Alexandra (Shailene Woodley), his teenage daughter home from rehab to make the rounds to friends and family while taking care of his youngest daughter Scottie (Amara Miller). She then drops a bomb that will change all of their lives forever. To make matters more complicated, the principle story is told over the backdrop of an important land deal which Clooney is the sole decider.The conclusions of these multiple strands of story all unravel unexpectedly and with a great deal of pathos. Set on location in Hawaii, the exotic location juxtaposes itself with the very human characters and their very human problems. By making even the more cutthroat characters fully fleshed out, Alexander Payne makes a relatively straightforward story a messy tale about love, family and fidelity.George Clooney is surprisingly effective as a bourgeois land baron trying desperately to keep his head above water. The real revelation however is Shailene Woodley who brings depth to the familiar surly teenager trope. Instead of simply tagging along for the ride, her character grows intelligently and in tandem with George Clooney's making their reunion as a family all the more satisfying.My review is not without its scruples however. The music (This time not provided by Rolfe Kent) was a little distracting. Nick Krause's "friend" character is first seen as an annoying stereotype. As the story progresses the film attempts to make him better realized but this is met with mixed results. Additionally actress Amara Miller has great instincts for someone her age but is given very little screen time to develop her character.Ultimately however, "The Descendants" is a wonderful film. It's poignant, effective and gentle and provokes genuine un-coaxed emotion.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Big Daddy of all entertainers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>an excellent entertainer, eye popping special effects, decent songs, Shailene's Beauty and the charm of Sir George Cloonie and of course the lovable Amara Miller ;) i loved this movie. The Descendants , directed by Alexander Payne, is a Cloonie Express that transports you to a world you can't envision. Cloonie's feats are legendary by now. In The Descendants, he goes a step further. The Descendants in The Descendants not only follows orders of their creator, but also cook, fight, romance and wonder of wonders, have lengthy conversations with a mosquito and scan loads of books/magazines and an entire telephone directory in a second. Yes, you read it right! Only thing, Payne could've controlled the length of the film. It could've been shorter by at least 3 to 4 minutes, which includes doing away with a song or two. Of course, like all Alexander Payne movies, the songs are filmed most imaginatively on exotic locales, but what's the point of having songs if they act as speed breakers? That Alexander Payne ranks amongst Hollywood's best directors is well known by now and The Descendants only cements the fact. His vision and execution of the difficult subject deserves the highest praise, in fact distinction marks. He not only dreams big, but the outcome is incredible too. A. Rahman's music doesn't compliment the content of the film, but like I pointed out earlier, every song has been filmed exquisitely. The action and chase sequences are outstanding Yuen Woo Ping, action choreographer in the MATRIX and KILL BILL sequels, was the stunt coordinator. Visual effects are spectacular Stan Winston Studio, the studio behind JURASSIC PARK, PREDATOR, TERMINATOR, IRON MAN, AVATAR, provided the animatronics technology. Cinematography captures the grand production values with precision. The locations of Austria, Machu Picchu in Peru, U.S.A. and Brazil only enhance the visual appeal of the film. The sets are mind-blowing. Dubbing is near-perfect.On the whole, The Descendants is a crowd-pleasing and hugely mass appealing tale of android revolution with a thrilling plot, rich and imaginative screenplay, super action, astounding effects and most importantly, Clooniet, who is the soul of the film. It's the Big Daddy of all entertainers. Miss it at your own risk!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Ahh, finally! I was beginning to wonder if 2011 was going to produce a film that I could whole-heartedly recommend to both cinephiles and casual movie goers. Writer/director Alexander Payne has delivered a gem. And in a giant surprise, it stars George Clooney as a guy going through real life stress, and in his own words, "just trying to keep his head above water".Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer in Hawaii who is also the trustee of a family land trust. Only this is no typical family land trust. It involves thousands of pristine Kauai acreage that has been left untouched for hundreds of years. The endless stream of "cousins" want him to sell to a developer for hundreds of millions. The locals don't want him to sell as they believe in the spiritual nature of land, not the green backs of hotels and beachfront homes. And Matt only wishes this was his biggest problem.Matt's fun-loving wife has been injured in a speed boat accident. She is in a coma and the prognosis is not bright. She also has a living will that states no life-support, which is another of the problems Matt must face. Additionally, he must re-connect with his two daughters. See, Matt has been the workaholic attorney that has left the child-rearing to his wife. The two daughters prove to be more than a hand full for the clueless Matt. Scottie (Amana Miller) is the youngest, and is struggling with how to react to the state of her mother. Alexandra(Shailene Woodley) is off at boarding school in hopes that she can be tamed from her wild ways. These three must come together and really bond for the first time.Those three problems would be enough for any one man to handle, but Matt receives one more bit of information. Turns out his wife was having an affair at the time of her boating accident. So, "having a bad day" seems a little insufficient for Matt's situation. At this point, the movie takes an odd turn and almost becomes a mini-road trip movie. Matt, his two daughters and Alexandra's off-beat friend Sid (Nick Krause) take on the mission of informing friends and relatives, while also tracking down the "other guy".It may seem like I have given away much of the story, but in fact, all of that has been discussed in one of the trailers. What sets this film apart is how this web of stress is handled by Matt and daughters. The story is based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, and the screenplay is co-written by Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash. Watching Matt as he struggles through each decision and situation makes us pull for him, even though he really isn't anything special ... he's not all that friendly or charming (a rarity for a Clooney character), and certainly no parent of the year.Alexander Payne has given us "About Schmidt" and it's been 7 years since his last feature, "Sideways". Both of those films and this one give us a character on the brink ... full crisis mode. Some of his characters lash out (Paul Giamatti in Sideways), while others turn to introspection (Jack Nicholson in About Schmidt). Here, Clooney's character seems to have many decisions to make, but the biggest one is reconnecting with his own soul and being the kind of man he needs to be, for himself, his daughters and the sacred land.The characters and story are so effective that you will find yourself tearing up in the same scene where you laugh out loud. And that will happen more than once. Few filmmakers can walk the high wire between comedy and drama better than Payne. We connect with these character as they are real people ... we KNOW these people. And we know excellent filmmaking when we see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Hawaii, but It's Not Paradise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Descendants," adapted from the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, shows that people can always surprise us, no matter how well we think we know them. It tells the story Matt King (George Clooney), who may live in Hawaii but doesn't live in paradise. His wife, Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie), lies in a coma in a Honolulu hospital following a boating accident; only after finding out that she will never reawaken, only after deciding to take her off life support, does he finally learn that she had been cheating on him. He found out from, of all people, his seventeen-year-old daughter, Alexandra (Shailene Woodley), who fought with her mother after catching her with another man. Even now, as she lies in a hospital bed with her mouth agape and an air tube sticking out of her throat, Alexandra remains angry and rebellious ? a boarding school party girl who's first seen as a belligerent drunk.The details of the affair are for the most part not discussed. The best we get is a close friend telling Matt that Elizabeth was unhappy in the marriage. We, of course, will never know what share of the blame she deserves. It is clear, however, that Matt has been distant from his family. If he were engaged, it wouldn't be a matter of missing the telltale signs of an affair, which are very hard to hide; it would be a matter of her not wanting to cheat on him at all. He's a lawyer by trade, and a successful one at that. Despite this, he isn't one to let himself or his family spend money recklessly. According to his opening narration, Elizabeth considered this stinginess. He considers it the best piece of advice his father gave him: Give them enough money to do something, but not so much that they do nothing.He never had to be so actively involved in the life of the younger daughter, ten-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller), who seems understandably confused by it all. He was always the backup parent, the understudy. Now that Elizabeth is dying, he has no choice. Although his primary reason for retrieving Alexandra from boarding school was to give her the chance to say goodbye to her mother, there's no escaping the fact that he also wanted help raising Scottie. He even tells her at one point that he has no idea what to do. I was torn between admiring his honesty and wondering why he got married and had children in the first place. I would not classify him as a workaholic, but he's definitely not a family man. Even during the periods where he gets along with his children, it's obvious that the connection is weak.Matt has more on his plate than the impending death of his wife. He's the trustee of his family's ancestral lands, a beautiful patch of virgin soil where Elizabeth and Alexandra used to go camping. He's under pressure to sell the land, which will be developed into a luxury resort and commercial complex. Obviously, Hawaii doesn't have enough of those already. It's a family affair, with most of those involved being his cousins. The most prominent is Hugh (Beau Bridges), with the long, windblown hair and a vocabulary partially influenced by surfer dudes. They're all the descendants of a Hawaiian princess and a missionary, who married sometime in the nineteenth century. Many of them feel entitled and would like Matt to make the sale. The select few that don't are pretty much in line with the entire population of Hawaii.Eventually, Matt learns the name of Elizabeth's lover and decides to confront him ? and allow him the opportunity to say goodbye to Elizabeth. So begins a cross-island search for a realtor named Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard), who's wife, Julie (Judy Greer), could not be sweeter. Along for the trip are Scottie, Alexandra, and Alexandra's friend, Sid (Nick Krause). Sid has the appearance of an idiotic beach bum, and indeed, he possesses the uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the wrong time. Case in point: He's punched by Elizabeth's perpetually angry father (Robert Forster), who can never address Matt or Alexandra without resorting to personal attacks. That being said, Sid understands the situation better than Matt gives him credit for.One of the strengths of "The Descendants" is that it doesn't have an emotional arc. It runs the gamut from solemn to hilarious to heartbreaking to inspirational, much like life itself during times of stress and uncertainty. The best scenes all take place in Elizabeth's hospital room, where various characters have one-sided conversations of surprising depth and power. What they and the rest of the film so expertly demonstrate is something so true and yet so often glossed over in the movies: People are imperfect and complex. When tragedy fractures a family, there will inevitably be a long and difficult process of healing. There is no one way to go about it, and there certainly isn't a fixed time for everything to work itself out. There's no guarantee that anything will work out at all. But if there's love somewhere within, perhaps it's possible for life to go on.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Descendants is a unique, offbeat film with some pretty serious issues involving an entire family.George Clooney and his family own a large piece of beautiful land on Oahu that is in a trust that must be sold in 7 years. The family wants to sell because they would all be millionaires but George realizes if he sells, it'll be just another hotel with a golf course and parking and installed trees, bushes and grass just like everywhere else. He drives around his island and see's the same thing every day. Meanwhile, his wife is in a coma from a boating accident and he is dealing with her and their children. Everyone has issues here regarding wife and mother but how can you talk to her about it all? You can't. So everyone is punching bag for each other here. The acting is excellent by everyone! Especially George. I think this may be his best acting yet. The scenery is of course beautiful but here we see Hawaii as a backdrop to some pretty intense issues reminding everyone that for the people who live there, their life is not one big vacation.Excellent film, a bit offbeat, a bit sad and funny at the same time. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of talented movie actors like George Clooney and was anxiously anticipating the opening of The Descendants which received universal acclaim by the critics (on Metacritic). In fact I saw it on the first day out in the Washington area at the Landmark Bethesda Row independent theater in Bethesda, Maryland. As usual, the average age of a nearly full theater was 60 or higher. This is the age group of a lot of the moviegoers that appreciate independent films. Unlike many of them, my wife and I, who are in the demographic, also appreciate a lot of films that appeal to wider audiences.The movie is very well acted and that is what received my generous vote. It is about a father and his two daughters who have to deal with a family tragedy and a not so secret family secret. The movie takes place in Hawaii where the scenery is a big plus. However, don't believe the hype that this will bring tears to your eyes in one moment and make you laugh out loud in the next. There are a number of comical moments, but there was noting in the movie that brought me to tears. Not even close, and there have been a number of movies that have brought a tear to my eye. Actually, I didn't feel any real connection with or any sadness for anyone in the movie. I can see that George Clooney may be nominated for an Oscar for his role in this movie, but that alone is not enough for me to recommend the movie to you. I understand this movie will be released everywhere on the day before Thanksgiving. It will be interesting to see if it is successful or will go the way of another recent George Clooney movie, The Men Who Stare at Goats. I will say the Decendants was much better that the goat movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar Worthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This tragic-comic drama called Descendants is an amalgam of emotions and rituals, a condensed peek at grief and renewal in the paradise called Hawaii. As Matt King (George Clooney) voices over at the beginning a sober reflection that we should not think all is paradise when it is not, director Alexander Payne makes sure his Hawaii has few tourist ornaments and ukuleles and ample cloudy skies.For the rest of this remarkably insightful visit with a grieving family (his wife is approaching death from a boating accident), Matt must navigate life with two kids, Alex (Shailene Woodley) and Scottie (Amara Miller) he has previously had little to do with and relatives eager to sell land for which he is the trustee. This is Clooney's role of a lifetime, nuanced with pathos and humor and enhanced by his self-effacing charm.I must admit to being unable to think of a better acting job this year, not even his buddy Brad Pitt in Moneyball or Tree of life. Payne shares some of Clooney's honor for pacing him to let us understand his head is just above water, and for clouding over much of the sky to mitigate the joy that comes with breathing and sunning in paradise.Payne is generous with all his characters, who are rounded enough to be memorable and distinctive. One of the Clooney children's friends, Sid (Nick Krause), is oafish at the beginning but becomes almost heroic as he supports Clooney against the overwhelming circumstances.Nothing in this film is spectacular because it is about dealing with daily challenges like infidelity and death. Contradictions abound such as the saintly comatose wife with a past and charming father lost in the obligations he has avoided. In that regard we are all descendants of the human race, tortured by chance and driven by fate to love and lose, live and die, and if we're lucky, find a smile or two and someone to love?if it's our children doing the loving, so much the better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Sideways.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne has had a hiatus for seven years now. His last film before this one was Sideways, which was a hit with critics and audiences alike. It certainly didn't take Alexander seven years to make The Descendants. During that period, I'm not sure what happened to him. Well enough about the director, since you're here to read the review for this film in itself. The Descendants, which is based on a pretty unknown novel of the same name, is about a man named Matt King trying to re-connect his family. That all changes when he finds out that his wife, who was supposedly injured and in a coma in a boating accident, was really cheating on him. I don't want to spoil much more than that so you can enjoy this film if you go see it. I saw this at the Telluride Film Festival and was blown away. It is better than Sideways, and excellent comedy-drama. Oscars? Absolutely. It is easily one of the years best films, and a major Oscar contender. George Clooney and Shailene Woodley's roles are outstanding. I encourage you to see this film in November. It truly is a wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human drama, brought pleasantly lightly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was not a movie I was absolutely in love with but it still was one that I really liked and could appreciate for all it did.You could really call this movie a human drama. With this I mean that the movie has plenty of drama in it but in a very realistic and sensible way. These are all very human characters, dealing with some very human things, in a very human way.And thing that the movie also has definitely going for it, is that it doesn't ever tell its story in a too heavy handed way. This could had so easily turned into a melodramatic picture but instead it picks a far more interesting approach by making things more light and almost comical at times. This also makes the movie its story and all its developments a surprise, for most part of the movie. It cleverly avoids all of the clichés, through its great writing and storytelling abilities by Alexander Payne, who has really mastered the genre.Really still the biggest key, as to why this movie works, are its characters. They are all not without their flaws and weaknesses, which makes them very realistic ones, first of all things. But all manage to become some very likable characters, despite of all their weaknesses. You also really start to feel and understand their feelings and why they do certain things the way they do and respond in certain ways. This is a real accomplishment, since you have to remember that this goes for basically each and every character and there are of course a whole bunch of very different characters in this movie.Alexander Payne has always been a director that knows how to get the best out of his actors. And this movie really is no exception to that. Really, once you start thinking about it, George Clooney is a guy that has always maintained his own acting style and therefore often seems to be playing the same guy over and over again (not that is a complaint though. I still really like him as an actor). But still I can say with almost absolute certainty that he has never been better in any other movie before. Also truly impressive was the unknown Shailene Woodley, as the oldest daughter. Lets hope we will get to see many more great things of her, in the coming future.A great watch and you definitely shouldn't be scared off by its heavy and serious subjects.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure to earn George Clooney a Best Actor nod at the Oscars (he's already bagged a Golden Globe nom), this life-affirming flick from Sideways and All About Schmidt writer-director Alexander Payne is more of the filmmaker's trademark 'serious comedy'. Despite an otherwise depressing tale at its core ? Clooney's wife is in a coma, his two misbehaving daughters aren't letting up, his extended family is pushing him to sell land that will make them rich, and, to top it all off, he then finds out his wife was being unfaithful to him ? Payne's script, and the quality cast, possess impeccable comic timing. Clooney has perfected his craft over the last few years and here delivers another bold performance; his nuanced and complex character remains achingly relatable and eminently watchable. When the film explores larger themes of Hawaiian culture and ancestral ties to land it gains worthiness to be sure, however loses a portion of the intimateness built up with Clooney and co; making me wonder if Payne should've stuck exclusively with the dysfunctional and highly interesting family on show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite "Sideways" but high-quality filmaking nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's last movie, 2004's "Sideways", was comedic, dramatic, intelligent, fare that dealt with real-life grown-up problems in a compelling and realistic way. Much can be same of "The Descendants" with the replacement of more tragedy in place of comedy. Sadly, it took 7 years for Payne to return to the big screen but happily, he seems to have invested most of those in this film. Each scene has a high-quality sheen of thoughtfulness and deliberation and one assumes George Clooney and the lesser-known actors earned their money here by doing take after take. The story of a workaholic father compelled to prove himself outside of his family's somewhat randomly inherited fortune of Hawaiian cash and property who suddenly faces the need to bring his family back together after his wife's boating accident is rich and complex. The film presents a study of motivation even including those of the comatose wife in a smart and intriguing way. Payne folds the plot together point by point, much like a skilled creator of origami, so that the beautiful finished product doesn't fully manifest itself until the very end. The best picture nomination it will received is earned but it isn't quite a classic as it lacks comedic leavening to sweeten up it's dark tones of death, infidelity, failure (as a father) and pressure (to decide what to do with the half-billion dollars worth of land the family owns.) Also, the inclusion of the character of Sid, as the older daughter's boyfriend, feels a bit tacked on and we are never quite clear why he incongruously is included in all of the family's intimate moments. In short, an intelligent tear-jerker well worth seeing on the big screen which will give "Hugo" strong competition for the Best Picture Oscar award.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly powerful and beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Extraordinary performances and a great story that mingles the relationships among a range of "descendants:" haoles and Hawaiians, people and the land, and one family. I almost didn't see the movie based on story reviews - man's dying wife had an affair, so what - who needed a repeat of a Cary Grant/Irene Dunne romp. Glad I went. George Clooney and Robert Forster, among others, movingly portray contrasting and nuanced versions of male emotions, constraints and behaviors, balanced by the strengths and sensitivities we see and hear about among the women and girls. Enough humor to keep it all human and amusing. A particular treat for those of us smitten with Hawaii.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one will make many of the ten best lists for the year. It could garner Best Picture and Director mentions.Oustanding performances all around. George Clooney has never been better. The downside is it's hard to get past George Clooney and see Matt King, the character he plays.If you think George looks good wait 'till you see the scenery. A touch of beautiful location photography helps relieve the dialogue driven play like feeling. A Island based musical score fits well.There are comic elements that lighten three generations of tear jerking dramatic material. It would have been interesting to have more information on the "decendants laws" that didn't seem to be a problem for previous generations.Ignore a few flaws, too many coincidences, and the fact when the going gets tough, the tough take a trip. It's a big, small movie that is worth your time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Descendants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Descendants is based upon the novel of the same name by Kaui Hart Hemmings. The film focuses on a middle aged man named Matt King, who both bonds and learns more about himself and his two daughters Alexandra and Scottie, during a family crisis. I do not want to give too much away about The Descendants because even just giving away a little information could spoil the whole movie for you and I do not want to go that route. Many other reviews I have read are more specific about what the movie is about, but also give away a lot of spoilers in the process, so if that is the way you want to go, you have lots of different critics to read. Anyways, there were quite a few things I did like about The Descendants, but I did not feel it was a perfect film and in a sense I am a bit surprised at all the love the film is getting from critics and different awards ceremonies. I did like the film and found the acting to be quite good all around and the story was interesting enough and kept me entertained, but I just could not connect with the film the way I wanted to and the way I thought I would. The film deals with some fairly heavy and depressing issues that face the family in this film and instead of feeling any emotion for them, whether it be sadness, joy, or basically any feelings at all, I did not feel anything. I did not think that the writing was strong enough for us to connect to any of these characters, or their situations on a personal level, so it left me instead feeling cold and uncaring towards them, which is not what I wanted to feel, but due to vague and subdued writing and character study, that is exactly how I did feel. When you have a film dealing with heavy issues and when you are trying to get the audience to care for your characters and feel with them, laugh and cry with them, you have to make your characters worthy of empathy and sympathy and allow the audience to some how connect with those characters during the film. Instead of doing that, during the duration of this film I always felt distant with them. It was not like I was in a room with them dealing with the issues they were, but instead it felt like I was watching a movie, or a television soap opera, just with better acting. The other reason for this is that the film feels too glossy and polished for this type of subject matter. The film looks and feels like a major Hollywood production, even though it is considered an independent film and if it had been done on a more low key level, say even cinema verite, or a documentary type feel and not using beautiful spotlight type actors and had they improved the chemistry you had with the characters, then I could see this film working, but instead the whole thing feels like you are watching a movie and none of it feels real or resonates with those watching it. Also the fact that the film takes place and is filmed in Hawaii is fine except for the part that I felt it was distracting and also took away from the story. It further made everything look glamorous and beautiful and took away from the pain and feelings that the characters were feeling and including an upbeat and peppy Hawaiian soundtrack did not help either. The Descendants did have good acting and I was never bored, or uninterested in what I was watching, but just could not ever connect with it, so a lot of it was lost on me unfortunately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyed watching this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I saw this movie, and both liked it. It was just an easy going movie, with a pleasant story to follow. It has an element that I have long advocated more movies have, a story that takes us somewhere, and shows us something we may not have experienced before. In this case, the story took us to Hawaii, where I have never been, and will probably never have the opportunity to go, there was lots of pleasant Hawaiian music, and scenery. I felt like I had been transported to Hawaii for a nice visit. The story dealt with some serious issues, but diffused them so they weren't so disturbing. It was nice to see George Clooney in a drama that most people would be able to watch, no killing, or things blowing up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Takes A Family to Make A Village</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is highly recommended.Set in modern day Hawaii, in a land lost between scenic palm trees and concrete squalor, Alexander Payne's The Descendants begins with the image of a healthy and happy wife and mother of two on a boating trip. This character rarely speaks or communicates in much of the film, but her role as family matriarch plays into the drama that will unfold. No, the main character of our tale happens to be her husband, Matt King, winningly played by George Clooney. Matt is not much of a husband, dad, or family man. He rarely is in touch with his estranged daughters. He is more devoted to his business ventures which afford him and his family all the wealth, fame, and social standings on the island. He and his family also own prime real estate on this section of paradise and are deciding on parceling out some of that land for tourist attractions, resorts, and condominiums. That is, before tragedy befalls them and their lives are thrown together once again.Clooney continues to ooze charm and bravado with his screen persona. The actor wisely downplays his handsome good looks to mask a frightened man-child suddenly faced with life's reality and responsibility. This is a finely honed portrayal that encapsulates a common man caught and unable to escape the dilemmas that now face him. Clooney's intrinsic acting reaches comic highs with his slow burns and dead-pan reactions one moment, only to become quite emotionally centered and heartfelt in his more dramatic scenes in the latter part of the film. This is one of his finest performances in a career of strong film roles.The supporting cast that surrounds Clooney is an accomplished lot. The daughters are played by newcomers Amara Miller as Scottie and Shailene Woodley as Alexandra who play off each other very well as real siblings would. Woodley, in particular, is a revelation, handling the comedic and dramatic sides of this troubled teenager with great maturity and self- assurance. Nick Krause as Alexandra's dim-witted stoner boyfriend brings such levity and humor to his sweet but stereotypical role. He channels Keanu Reeves laid-back spirit rather well. Beau Bridges as Matt's Cousin Hugh and Robert Forster as Matt's exasperated and angry father-in-law, and Matthew Lillard as Matt's rival add their individual imprint to the creative mix of personalities involved within the family dynamics.Of course, none of this could have succeeded as well without the perceptive and adroit script by Payne ( with Nat Faxon and Jim Rash ). The screenplay layers the dialog in a completely naturalistic way and has developed fully dimensional characters to which the movie audience can actually relate. However, Payne's direction, though efficient, is somewhat routine, relying on too many close-ups and voice-overs that tend to overplay the action. He directs in a very straight-forward manner, lacking in much bravado style and finesse with no flashy camera-work or special effects to impress. Yet it is his story and verbal exchanges that empower this wonderful film. Words, rather than visual imagery, are his forte and, on that level, Payne truly excels.The film focuses on the sense of regret, the unavoidable changes that happen to us all, and life always spinning out of our control. It is a film of restraint and quiet insights that effectively mixes the sweet with the bitter and shows its flawed characters as merely individuals in need of each other, in search of a connection. With its inspired casting, clever screenplay, and solid direction, The Descendants ascends toward the top of my list as one of the best films of the year.

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film, Well Acted: SPOILER ALERT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney has been justifiably lauded for his role as Matt King in "The Descendants," but the surprise in this film is Shailene Woodley, who plays Alex, his 17-year-old daughter. She perfectly captures every emotion that the story requires her to display. Not since Keira Knightley made her debut in "Bend It Like Beckham" has a fresh new face shown such star quality.Since it is revealed immediately, I'm not spoiling anything by reporting that this complicated movie is about a woman, Elizabeth King, who's been in an accident that will prove fatal and the impact of her impending death on her husband, daughters and (more incidentally) her parents. Clooney, her husband, is the ranking member of the large King clan that dates back to Hawaii's beginning and owns an immense property on one of the islands. The property is held in trust and Matt alone has the power to decide what to do with it, which is worth an enormous amount of money and which most members of the family are determined to sell.Matt, confronted with his wife's situation, acknowledges that he's been an inattentive father and must now take full responsibility for Alex and for Scottie (Amanda Heller), her eight-year-old sister. Alex (Woodley) is in full rebellion, consigned to a prep school on another island where she seems to be majoring in alcohol, drugs, ignoring curfew and sex. Her father flies in to bring her home, leaving Scottie in a friend's care. Alex's first reaction when she finds her mother in a coma is to release a hate-filled tirade. She quickly reveals that her conflict with her mother has been prompted by discovery of her mother's infidelity. The rest of the story takes off from this revelation, which comes as a total shock to Matt and sends him off, with his daughters in tow, to find his wife's lover. Meanwhile, in the background and at times in the foreground, Matt must decide what to do about the family- owned property. Part of the action takes place on or near the property, giving Alexander Payne, the director, and his team opportunities to show some of Hawaii's great beauty.As the story deepens and Matt learns the identity of his wife's lover with an assist from Alex, we witness the daughter's transformation as she takes care of her younger sister, empathizes with her father and even comes to terms with her mother who will never awake from her coma. But Alex is not transformed instantly or completely. Through the deepening of the story until the very end, she takes along her boyfriend , Sid (Nick Krause), a particularly insensitive teenage jerk who can't even suppress a laugh when Alex's distressed grandfather, Elizabeth's father, says something which Sid considers funny.Matt's progression is on a different level than Alex's. Having identified Elizabeth's lover, a real estate man who stands to make a lot of money if the King family property is sold, Matt invites him to come see her for one last time at the hospital, but refrains from the easy path to revenge which would be to tell his wife. Matt decides, however, not to sell the family property -- and one is left to wonder whether a factor in that decision might not have been to keep his wife's lover from earning his commission. At the end, Matt forgives his wife, affirms his love and kisses her on the lips. Clooney, like Cary Grant before him, is so good-looking and charming that he is underrated as an actor. His performance in this film is outstanding, and he seems certain to be nominated for an Oscar as best actor. Ms. Woodley has not received a lot of notice from the critics and will probably not be nominated. But she WILL be a star. She has the looks and the presence, and she is a very capable young actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging drama about relationships - not just for 'chicks'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Descendants' focuses on the life of a family during the days when the mother lies in a coma after a boating accident, poised between life and death. Nothing crashes or blows up on screen, but there are plenty of emotional detonations as her husband and two daughters struggle to meet the challenges and, oddly, the obligations of the unexpected, tragic crisis. This is neither a perfect family nor a perfect mess of a family - it's something in between. They are well off - definitely 1 percenters - live comfortably, and are each very engaged in their lives and communities. The girls, Mom included, are hell raisers to some degree, but in ways that attract more than repel - they each make friends and play well with others, at least some of the time. Yet the members of the family are subtly estranged from each other, and we learn from Clooney's narrative and monologues with his wife's inert form that the marriage was a source of some disappointment for both of them, a disappointment that was not confronted or resolved in their years together. The movie takes us through the resolution of this family crisis, revealing progressively what each character has withheld from the others, and loops in a larger plot involving their extended family and, in effect, the entire Island community. Clooney gives a consistent, effective performance, and is one of the reasons this movie should work alright for the average guy (Women on average tolerate him pretty well, I believe) despite it's focus on relationships as the subject matter and rather slow pace. He maintains a strong masculine 'hero' persona throughout, and definitely rises to the tragic occasion. Along the way, he responds in ways, some comic and some cliché, that make him an attractive 'male' perspective from which to view the events of the film. He is strong, well meaning, active, and ultimately prevails to a large degree in the terms of the film. I really enjoyed the performance of Shailene Woodley in the role of his daughter, poised on adulthood. Her character's response to Clooney and their work with one another represents the visible 'love story' - father-daughter in this case - that makes the movie work moment to moment.The comatose patient is very much a character in several of the most important scenes. I was struck by how silent the relatively full theater was during some of these climactic moments. The audience was neither restless nor tearful, just intent, during even the long, slow, quiet moments. Never sentimental, the film focuses on the experience of confronting death in others as an argument for living life authentically, acknowledging and resolving conflict rather than lapsing into comfortable disengagement.All in all, a fascinating couple of hours of storytelling, acting, and thought-provoking cinema. A notch or two above the average theater experience, and way higher than the average among films that tackle this category of emotional experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of spiritual awakening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Character growth seems like a lost art in many films these days but I'm happy to say that self-discovery plays a prominent role in The Descendants, Alexander Payne's first film since Sideways seven years ago. Based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, George Clooney is Matt King, a well-to-do real estate lawyer, who lives with his wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) and two daughters, Scottie (Amara Miller) and Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) in Hawaii. At the outset, Matt's voice-over tells us not to expect Hawaii to be a paradise, that while it has beautiful scenery, it's not a paradise to those whose life is a daily grind and where family problems are as troublesome as anywhere else. Matt, whose family has deep roots in Hawaii, is the executor of a trust that holds 25,000 acres of beachside property, land that has been in the family for 150 years. He and his cousin Hugh (Beau Bridges) are in the process of collecting bids from big developers who want to turn it into resort property but Matt has the final say. While the negotiations are taking place, tragedy strikes. Matt's wife Elizabeth is in the hospital, seriously injured and in a coma from a boating accident. As a result, Matt has to assume the obligation of being both father and mother to his young daughters, especially being caring and present to their needs, attributes that seem to have been missing in his relationship with his family. It is quite obvious from the rebellious behavior of his daughters that they feel emotionally isolated and unloved. Seventeen-year-old Alex has been sent to a boarding school on another island for drug problems while ten-year-old Scottie has been sending threatening text messages to a girl in her class and is forced to apologize in person at her friend's home. After Alex comes home, Matt's world receives another jolt when, during a confrontation, she confesses to him that she knows her mom had been cheating on him for some time. Matt seems passive and uncertain as to how to deal with a difficult situation and appears to be more upset about the adultery than anything else. Though only a few days ago, Matt fantasized about how things would be different when she wakes up, he now learns that Elizabeth most likely will not recover from her injuries and searches for the best way to tell his family and friends. He asks Alex and Scottie to go with him to Elizabeth's parents to tell them first that she will not recover. Things become emotionally inflamed when Alex brings her boyfriend Sid (Nick Krause), a teenage stoner stereotype. When Sid makes dumb and inappropriate remarks, her grandfather Scott (Robert Forster) reacts in a childish way by throwing a punch at him, then they all have to listen to him berate Matt for not meeting his daughter's needs. Sid is in the film presumably for comic effect, but his effect is more offensive than comic. Implausibly, Matt goes to Sid late one night to ask for his advice on how to deal with his daughters, a ludicrous venture, but, in the process, discovers that beneath his irritating front, Sid is also going through his own grieving process. After some investigating, Matt discovers that the man Elizabeth had been seeing and was apparently in love with is Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard), also in real estate and who stands to profit from the sale of Matt's land. He decides to find Brian, not only to see what he is like but to invite him to visit Elizabeth at the hospital. The girls go with him to Kauai where Speer is on business and discovers that he is staying in a house directly opposite the beach they are visiting. Matthew's encounter with Speer and his wife (Judy Greer) enables him to communicate his pain and let go of some of his anger. But the process of letting go is not complete until he "talks" to his wife at the hospital, and begins to connect with his daughters in a way that was not possible only a short time ago. This connection also plays a role in how the real estate sale is handled. The Descendants is both funny and touching and the performance of George Clooney is one of his best, but it is not a perfect film. As in other recent works with a theme of forgiveness, important teachable moments, especially at the hospital, are overlooked. Also getting in the way is the materialist philosophy espoused my Matt that "everything just happens," not aware perhaps that, in fact, everything does happen for a reason. These considerations notwithstanding, The Descendants is a strong film, marked by superb performances, especially by Clooney, Woodley, and Greer, outstanding cinematography by Phedon Papamichael, and a feeling of authenticity. On the surface, it is about the grieving process, but, underneath, it is about connection and responsibility to the planet we inhabit and to those who are on this journey with us. As author John Major Jenkins said, "Let's remember that emergence is attended by a sense of emergency, and this is a hallmark of spiritual awakening. We may even call it a crisis, a crossroads. A collective crucifixion as we ride the wave of earth's apotheosis, awakening to the sacredness of the living sanctuary that our ancestors simply called "home."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Basic Beautiful New Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Within the territory of family drama this is a welcome addition, first because it reminds us of the mysterious land of Hawaii. (Hm. The last movie I can remember taking us to the 50th state is "Cocktail." There may be many Hawaiian movies... I just don't know...It's through rather circuitous circumstances that I even wound up attending the NYFF screening of This Movie.). I am curious about the source material. Is it as noble as the movie? Each character is strongly drawn and brilliantly casted... there is so much conveyed through the silent expressions of each as they listen to each other. This is much to the credit of the actors and the inconceivably professional work-a-day approach of the director and his staff. They are simply fulfilling the responsibility they assumed to deliver the movie with the benefit of their artistry, talent, and sensitivity. The question I have about the script is how it arrived at this perfect naturalistic state. I think it's fair to say seven years of work could have gone into it. And brilliant visual information illuminates the dialogue and narration. It all works seamlessly. In addition to humorously, sometimes hilariously, delivering great struggle, kindness and joy, The Descendants meets and raises a standard for creative worthwhile cinema. Perhaps another time we can consider plot elements (I have a fondness for, and issues with each). The movie features an investigation into a mystery after the fact. However,it plays less as plot structure than as a window into a relatable world parallel to our own. And there can be more. If everyone is up for it, I think this great cast and crew could deliver a great sequel. Peter Dizozza</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Performance from Clooney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Descendants, The (2011) **** (out of 4) Alexander Payne's latest features George Clooney playing Matt King (George Clooney), a father trying to reconnect with his children (Shailene Woodley, Amara Miller) days after his wife had an accident that has her in a coma. Along the way the three try to reconnect as Matt also has to deal with a major family issue involving land as well as try and get control of a few secrets his wife was holding. While I watched THE DESCENDANTS I realized that there have been many films to deal with family troubles so on that level this wasn't anything new. I mean, anyone with money can throw together a movie but it takes someone very special to take a familiar story and tell it as if it's the first time we've ever seen it and that's exactly what Payne has done. I was really amazed that I was on the edge of my seat from the opening scene to the very last one and the entire time we go on a rather incredibly journey with these three people and there wasn't single second where I knew where the film was going or what plot twist was going to happen. I think the most amazing thing is how Payne gives us this story and we just get to sit back and watch it unravel. The movie deals with some brutally raw emotions but yet it delivers all sorts including laughing, tears, drama and at times painful discussion about various life issues. Throughout the past decade Clooney keeps improving as an actor and this here might be the greatest of many great performances. I was rather uncanny seeing how well Clooney could slip into this role of a workaholic father who is in over his head having to deal with a wide range of issues in such a short time. Watching Clooney work here was really something remarkable to behold and the actor nailed every single second. When you watch professional actors you should always expect good work but there are cases when they go far beyond you're highest expectations and that's what Clooney has done here. The supporting cast is just as good and that includes Woodley who is remarkable as the oldest daughter. Nick Krause, Beau Bridges, Matthew Lillard and Robert Forster are all extremely good in their parts as well. The cinematography and music score are two more very important factors here. The screenplay is certainly the king as it goes through all sorts of emotions and you have a remarkable cast bringing it to life. THE DESCENDANTS is a rare movie that has so much power and emotion that you can't help get drawn into the stories and the characters. Certainly one of the best of its kind.</fullReview>
