		<shortDescription>Scary Movie 3!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3 is largely a spoof of five films, The Ring (2002), Signs (2002), 8 Mile (2002) and to a lesser extent, The Matrix (1999) and The Matrix Reloaded (2003). It begins with a spoof of the first scene from The Ring, then cuts to Tom's (Charlie Sheen) discovery of the crop circles on his farm ala Signs. As a bridge between the stories, Cindy Campbell (Anna Farris) is a television news reporter who is doing a story on the crop circles, and who is the guardian of a young psychic boy, Cody (Drew Mikuska), similar to Aidan of The Ring. The two stories turn out to be intimately connected. Tom's brother, George (Simon Rex) is a white rapper, ala Eminem in 8 Mile, and he strikes up a romance with Campbell. Meanwhile, President Harris (Leslie Nielsen) also becomes involved as the security of the country is threatened.I used to make it a point to not read any other reviews before I wrote my own, but recently, I've become curious when I watch a film I really enjoy, like Scary Movie 3, that many other people seemed to dislike. I find it informative to read the negative reviews to try to figure out why people dislike the film.The negative reviews for Scary Movie 3 weren't very helpful. The most popular complaints seem to be that the trailer ruined the film by "giving away the good parts" and that the film has fun at the expense of some people's sacred cows. Additionally, many people made a comment to the effect that you'd only enjoy the film if you're, say, 13 or under.I never watch trailers before I see a film any longer. I have also had trailers ruin many films for me in the past, so I just stopped watching them; I recommend that you do the same. If you don't know already, think about commonalities in the films you tend to like. Get an idea for the genres, directors, actors and so on that you usually enjoy. That's the only guide you really need to determine if you should see a film. It's not a guarantee, but what is? I actually look away when trailers appear on screen before the feature when I'm watching a film in the theater, and I try to mentally block out the sound. It's pretty easy to do, as trailers tend to be heavier on sound effects than dialogue. If trailers appear on television, I quickly change the channel. At any rate, it doesn't make the film you're considering any worse just because you watched a trailer first. Scary Movie 3 isn't bad because the trailer ruined it for you.Next, it's not a good idea to watch these kinds of comedies (we might call them "absurdist comedies", or "outrageous comedies") if you have any sacred cows--that is, anything that you feel one should not joke about, or that one could go too far in joking about. I don't see it as the film's fault if you haven't analyzed yourself and/or if you do not research the kinds of films you're considering viewing so that you don't expose yourself to something that you're going to consider offensive. If you're sensitive about certain things then you need to learn how to avoid them. If you're allergic to nuts or shellfish, you're going to be careful to not eat anything containing nuts or shellfish, right? It's not the chef's fault.Finally, I'm definitely older than 13--I'm in my late 30s, and I loved Scary Movie 3. I came very close to giving it a 10 out of 10--it was at that score until the climax, which I felt unfortunately lost a bit of the comic momentum that preceded it, and which arrived a bit too soon for my tastes (I prefer longer films).It helps to be familiar with the films being spoofed. Believe it or not a lot of the jokes are fairly subtle jabs at elements of the source material--for example, the pillow fight of the opening scene, which has connections to the almost lesbian subtext of the same scene in the original Japanese version of The Ring, Ringu (1998); or the character and camera "spins" when Tom first exits his farmhouse, which pokes fun at the stylistic cinematography of Signs. There are also many quicker references to other films. These will have far less payoff if you're not familiar with the source material. For example, during the climax of Scary Movie 3, there's not only a reference to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), but also the climax of Motel Hell (1980), which features an infamous chainsaw "duel".There is a stylistic difference between the first two Scary Movies and this one, which is undoubtedly correlated to the change in directors. Rather than the Wayans Brothers, David Zucker directs here. Zucker is the exclamatory wiz who also helmed Airplane! (1980), Top Secret! (1984), and The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! (1988). Scary Movie 3 is much more in the vein of Zucker's previous work than the other Scary Movies. I can't imagine why someone would like the one style and not the other, but if so, that might help you decide which Scary Movies to see, if any.Finally, there were also some complaints over the plot of this film, especially the combination of such seemingly disparate plots from the source material. It's important to remember that this is absurdist comedy, with an emphasis on absurd. The crazy segues from one plot to the other, with them meeting in the middle thanks to Cindy, President Harris and a number of other crazy devices, was beautifully ridiculous. I want ridiculous when I watch a film like this. That's largely what attracts me to the genre. If you're at all a fan of absurdism, you should find much to enjoy here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Parody movies are always of the type 'love or hate' it. I am not intellectual, I love cinema as culture, but also as entertainment, so I like them. Further, when I see this type of movie, I know exactly what I am going to see: scatological jokes, funny and surrealistic situations and definitely a movie that will never be indicated for an Oscar. I found this 'Scary Movie 3' very funny. It satirizes mainly 'The Ring', followed by 'Signs', and part of '8 Miles' and one of these last two 'The Matrix' sequences. The last scene is a joke with 'Final Destination'. This is the type of movie that you must shut down your brain and start laughing. There are two scenes that I liked very much: when the moron George (Simon Rex) is in a club for Afro-Americans, wins the rap competition and covers his head with the hood of his coat. The other one, when Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) uses her laptop and many screens pops-up. In many sites, even in IMDb, there are some pops-up screens that irritate me. What I do not understand is some comments of persons that should never watch this type of movie. What do they expect to see when they go to the movie theaters or buy / rent a DVD of 'Scary Movie 3', directed by David Zucker and with Leslie Nielsen in the cast? An art movie, with hidden messages, an epic, a classic or a film with politically correct jokes? Honestly, if I did not like this genre, I would never spend my time watching it. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): 'Todo Mundo em Pânico 3' ('Everybody in Panic 3')</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Put the name "Wayans" on it and I walk out of the theater (if ambushed), or change the channel. The Wayans are a brand name in Hollywood that can greenlight anything they want, but the traffic laws should be rewritten to prevent this. Fortunately, none of the Ws returned for this film.I did not see either of the first two films of this trilogy, but you really don't need to know the story to enjoy this film, since the plot of any good parody is just an excuse to deliver the maximum number of spoofs, gags, swipes, and one-liners by the end of the film. In that regard, this film does not disappoint.Anna Faris (Cindy Campbell) is a surprisingly strong and exceptionally hot leading lady who should be considered for any A-list roles in the future. She did everything asked of her and then some, and the sky appears to be the limit for her talent. Cindy is a reporter for a Newscast that brings to life the song "Dirty Laundry" by Don Henley (she's the bubbleheaded bleached blond who comes on at 5:00 and tells you about the plane crash with a gleam in her eye). Charlie Sheen plays a former reverend who lost faith after his hot wife was killed in an accident (again, they even made that funny).Anthony Anderson is excellent in his supporting role, while the rest of the cast could have been chosen by lottery, other than Leslie Neilsen, who seems to have a contract somewhere that says a parody can't be made without him (he plays the president in this one). George Carlin makes a creepy cameo, as does Eddie Griffin and Queen Latifah, but the stars of the movie are the jokes, and they come rapid-fire.The film was designed for an intelligent audience in tune with pop culture, and doesn't take time to explain itself: Simon Cowell gets to judge an 8-mile style rap battle with predictable and hilarious results; Anderson's character sheds more light on the possible depths of the relationship between B. Rabbit and Future; Leslie Neilsen gets to deliver a classic line from "Airplane" at one point, while showing that he's kept up with the times in another. The newsroom was more realistic than most would admit or want to believe, and the way the horror was delivered in this film (yes, it's a genuine horror movie) was a "Scream." We even get a nod to Final Destination (one of the most original concepts of all time), and at times the movie even seems to parody itself.If you liked "Airplane!" and its genre, there's little chance you won't like this film. If you can't stand that type of humor, get ready to tear your hair out. For better or worse, this film belongs in a time capsule to explain what a movie parody is and how it should be made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing the second and the third movie in the Scary Movie series short after each other, gave me the perfect opportunity to see what the change of director can do to a movie. I liked the first movie, but didn't find the second one worth another watch, because they had lost all originality or sense of good humor. All they did was badly repeating what had worked in the first movie and that is something that should be avoided at all time. Now with David Zucker as the director, the man who also gave us some other excellent parodies like "Airplane!" and "The Naked Gun", instead of Keenen Ivory Wayans, I had some good hopes again. And he certainly didn't disappoint me...Of course you'll recognize several famous movies again. This time they are making fun of "The Ring", "Signs", "8 Mile",... but also other aspects from showbiz will be treated. You'll find Michael Jackson and references to the sex tape with Pamela Anderson in it as well, but the main difference with "Scary Movie 2" is that this time it all has been written into one solid and hilarious story. And the story isn't the only thing that has been improved, so has the acting. With some famous actors like Charlie Sheen and Leslie Nielsen, who both have a solid record full of humorous TV-series and / or movies, you know that you can expect the best of the best again when it comes to this kind of humor. But people like for instance Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy were an excellent surprise and did give this movie something extra. I'm not saying that they had some very difficult roles, but what they did really worked and that's all I'm asking.Overall this movie is a lot better than the previous one. Once again it is full references to other movies, but it is the humor that makes the difference. It's probably because they have chosen a new director and have taken more time to come up with a new story, that the concept works again. I'm looking forward to "Scary Movie 4" and give this one a solid 7.5/10, perhaps even an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...that when you stop worrying about being just plain filthy and start caring about being funny you make a better comedy. I was not a huge fan of "Scary Movie", although it had it's moments. "Scary Movie 2" was just awful. A real disappointment. Then, I was not sure when I saw the Wayans weren't returning and the film was rated PG-13 if it would work at all. Finally caught the film last night and I laughed more 5 minutes of this sequel than I did during the others.It was great to see that David Zucker can still make a really funny parody movie. It was even more refreshing to see an attempt being made to not just out-gross, out-filth the previous film, and simply focus on making a truly funny comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can be short about 'Scary Movie 3'. If you liked the first two films, especially the first, there is a good chance you will like this one. It is directed by David Zucker, one of the three directors of the great 'Airplane!', the film that sort of invented the genre, and it shows. Here it spoofs films such as 'The Ring', 'Signs' and 'The Matrix' and from time to time I thought it was really funny.But when I think something is funny doesn't mean anything with a film like this. 'Scary Movie 3' is a matter of taste. If you like 'The Naked Gun', 'Hot Shots' and 'Scary Movie' you like this one, if you hate them, you hate this one. The humor is silly and stupid, but in the right mood most people must be able to laugh. I know I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Aiplane and Naked Gun - now this! You can see that it is a Zucker quality. Though I like the fist two movies, I must say this is the best one. This movie contains the least "potty- humor" and is sort of... classy.Everybody in the cast does a great job, and I was really impressed by Charlie Sheen, but the star in the picture is of course Leslie Nielsen. He is a veteran and a master of comedy. He doesn't need to make funny faces or anything to be funny. He's just him.I can honestly say, I didn't waste those 85 SEK for the ticket (85 SEK is about 11-12 US dollars).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary Movie 3: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A funny thing happened on the way to the movie theater tonight. The third installment of the Scary Movie series is not only PG-13, but is directed by comedy legend/genius David Zucker. Although he took over a series from the Wayans Brothers, Zucker turned it around into something almost completely new. It isn't quite in the same vein as his one true classic, Airplane!, but it shows how he should stay away from movies like My Boss's Daughter and go back into the spoof genre which got him, and his team, off the ground.The first movie based its main parodies around Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, and the second was mainly revolved around The Haunting. Scary Movie 3 has two central spoofs: The Ring and Signs. The protagonist from the first two, Cindy (Anna Faris), is now an anchorwoman who investigates a mysterious videotape while odd crop circles appear. Many celebrities have cameos in parodies of recent movies.Instead of extremely crude sexual humor, Zucker knew that you don't need lewdness to make people laugh. One of the reasons why Airplane! was so great is because it was only rated PG; almost all of the humor was situational and not just shock value. Sure, Scary Movie 3 had its share of crude humor, but it wasn't as over-the-top and unnecessary as the other two's were. Instead, what he did was take his parodies and make them seem possible. For example, George Carlin plays The Architect (a parody of The Matrix Reloaded) who spends all of his time alone in a giant room. He gets so lonely, he `bonds' with his chair, what most people would do.Also, what made Scary Movie 3 funny is how it pointed out the faults of the movies that it is spoofing. Throughout Signs, Mel Gibson doesn't even mention farming once, although he lives out on a farm. Charlie Sheen, who mocks the Gibson character, continuously talks about it for the first few minutes he's on screen. In 8 Mile, one of the things I hated about it was how everyone was speaking with huge words; here, parodies of those characters do exactly this.Scary Movie 3 did have some gags that didn't work, especially around the middle of the film. It seems that Zucker just wanted to move as quickly as possible and instead of making it even 90 minutes (it's about 75) he just wanted to make a quick, short parody film. Although Carlin's character was okay, Eddie Griffin and Queen Latifah's characters (as characters from The Matrix) weren't utilized as much as they should have been. Also, Leslie Nielsen, who has been in most of the Zucker spoofs, has a small role as the President and plays a typical Nielsen character. I would have liked to have seen more of him, but at least he was able to deliver a classic Airplane! line.Scary Movie 3 is one of the funniest movies of the year, with its almost continuous laughter. It's probably the best one out of the three in the series.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for pervasive crude and sexual humor, language, comic violence and drug references.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, but it could have been better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this one was rather funny, I liked it a tiny bit more than the first one (didn't see the 2nd), but that is probably because I saw all the movies they made fun of with the exception of "8 Mile". The problem is once again this movie isn't going to be very good if you haven't seen "The Ring" or "Signs" the two main ones they made fun of therefore it is not really a stand alone movie. You can miss "8 Mile" though as anything you saw in the previews of that one would be all you need. These "Scary Movies" and the last few parodies made really require you to see movies before you can enjoy. That just was not the case with movies like "Airplane" and "The Naked Gun", sure there were a few references that might of helped too if you saw the movie, but not a whole lot as it was stand alone funny. This movie mainly makes fun of "The Ring", there are some funny jokes here, but for my money the funniest stuff came at the expense of "Signs". The Ring probably made up 50 percent or more of the jokes with Signs at around 30 percent and "The Matrix Reloaded" and "8 Mile" making the remainder. There is one small joke that is Lord of the Rings related, but it isn't anything really funny. There was supposed to be something in it making fun of the Hulk, but I am pretty sure it was cut because I didn't notice anything. Which leads to another complaint, why the heck did they make the movie so short? This movie had to be an hour and twenty minutes max, you're telling me they couldn't find anything else to spoof? I really hate going to a movie that is under an hour and thirty minutes. Overall though it was an okay movie with some good laughs here and there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Funny Enough But Better Than The First 2 Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zucker, who's already experienced in making funny parody films such as 'Airplane' and 'Naked Gun', directs the third installment this time. Thankfully the Wayans brothers aren't in it to get on my nerves. 'Scary Movie 3' is a lot more enjoyable than its prequels. This one is not overloaded with vulgarity, sleaziness and toilet humour like the other two. Zucker actually manages to bring some class in this third film and there is quite a convincing plot that smartly combines Verbinski's 'The Ring' and Shyamalam's 'Signs'. My only complaint is that it's not funny enough. There were several sequences that could have been better done. Yet, the cast make it quite enjoyable. Leslie Nielsen is funny as the president but he does go a little too over the top at times. Anne Faris is back as Cindy, this time she adds some Naomi Watts to her character and does a commendable job. Charlie Sheen provides some laugh out loud moments, particularly in the scene with his wife Denise Richards. 'Scary Movie 3' is a much more enjoyable fair than the first two movies. This time I laughed at many of the scenes rather than feel sick (which was the case with 'Scary Movie 1' and 'Scary Movie 2').</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Video that Haunts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like movies. I like to talk about and think about movies. And I believe that nearly all movies are about other movies anyway. So when any movie comes along that is explicitly about movies, I'm in the ticketline. I really liked the first one because it referenced dozens and dozens of movies. The fact that they could be blended relatively seamlessly was part of the joke, but there was also the game of recognizing the source.The second one was no improvement on the invention of the first. But this installment is a completely different beast. It is as different from the others as any in the 'Alien' is different from the others.The Wayons are comics in the old-fashioned, standup sense. They make fun of life. When they poke fun at black stereotypes, they are poking fun at how things really are. So they have a big following in that community because their comments often 'ring true.' I really liked their work because it gave me double value for all that money I spend on bad movies.But the Zuckers are film comedians, a wholly different species. When they poke fun, they are poking fun not at life, but at the movies. Its a completely different sort of humor. The opening, for instance. In previous films, the dumb blond jokes were about dumb people. In this one, the jokes are about characters and are particularly complicated. Pammy pokes fun at herself, especially herself in the famous porn video. And all is in the context of a tape that haunts.Indeed, 'Ringu' was a movie about movies, and it forms the basis for this. Layered on that is '8 Mile,' a performance about a performance, here parodied by another layer of performance.Sheen and Nielson are there to poke fun at their prior appearances, and their skits are as deliberately (I think) as flat as the white rapper's. To further the film-about-films idea, we have a parade of outside references: the Michael Jackson bit as a Scoopy Doo character is pretty prime stuff.This kind of structure means that you have to make the targets deliberate. So instead of ratatat touching on over a hundred films, they focus on 3 or 4, so you know the score.I laughed a few times. But I laughed more when scanning the web and being reminded of certain skits, like the wake, which is a minor masterpiece of editing. My only regret is that the Weinsteins decided to de-raunch the whole thing. I would have tolerated the few score childish jokes for the few really clever, cutting ones that would have made it through.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

The storyline is a bit confusing; however, because it is absolutely hilarious, it's catchy and easy to watch. When there's a serious bit, something funny always happens - okay you kind of know what's going to happen next, but you'll be surprised at certain parts how the story suddenly twists. For example: The Michael Jackson Part, where he pretends to be the daughter but gets found out and starts a fight, screaming his famous "Oww!". Then he falls out the window, the guy trys to grab him, but ends up pulling off his nose! I really liked this movie, and if you're not to squeamish, you'll really enjoy it!

		<shortDescription>hit-and-miss movie parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Scary Movie 3' offers yet more hit-and-miss comedy in the 'Airplane/Naked Gun/Hot Shots' vein of movie parody. As with the previous two films in the 'Scary Movie' franchise, the writers of this film look towards recent popular horror movies to serve as the basis for both their jokes and their storyline. In this case, the plot is a cross between 'The Ring' and 'Signs,' with a few glancing blows aimed at 'The Others,' 'The Sixth Sense,' and, of all things, '8 Mile,' along the way.Charlie Sheen and Leslie Nielson are probably the most recognizable faces in the movie, both being veterans of earlier 'Airplane,' 'Naked Gun' and 'Hot Shots' films. As with most films of this type, some of the jokes in 'Scary Movie 3' work and some do not, but those that do are often quite ingenious and make the movie as a whole worth seeing. The crudity that marred the previous films in the franchise has been almost completely eliminated here. Some people may find that a loss while others may find it a gain. Frankly, I prefer the gentler, more innocent tone in this edition.'Scary Movie 3' isn't any great shakes as a comedy, and chances are you won't remember a thing about it even five minutes after you've seen it, but it will make you laugh quite a bit for the 80 or so minutes that you're watching it. And what more can one ask from a comedy than that?</fullReview>

But what the hell happened?! After the tragedy that was Scary Movie 2, i thought the cast and crew change would help matters, but its even worse.Within 20mins i'd smiled twice. Not one laugh, the jokes were recycled and originality was obviously no factor. The fact that at this point in writing, the majority of people on this site have voted it 10/10 has made me feel physically ill. When there's great flicks like School of Rock out, which actually have jokes that are *gasp* funny, anyone wasting their money on tripe like this needs their head examined.no stars/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea to begin with. The last film was a mediocre effort. Put it next to this load, it's a comedy classic. Whilst part two was filled with a lot of dated humor and cheap shots, at least it was funny. There's nothing funny about forced humor. Jokes, pratfalls and sight gags are supposed to be naturally funny. Hitting the viewer over the head with tired jokes is not cool. The humor in this film was caters to juvenile imbeciles who'll laugh at anything. When they catered to the junior high school crowd, any sense of self respect was tossed out the window. Ring parodies are not funny. I have watched them in comedies since 1998. They're so dated. Michael Jackson jokes are not cool either. What's even worse is making fun of two broken down has been "performers" whose best days were NEVER.The death of American cinema has been a slow one. Films like this are the nails that are being pounded into it's coffin. Whatever happened to real humor? I haven't laughed out loud in a movie theater in a long time. Too many bad movies rot the brain. You want proof? Go to your local mega chain video rental store and see what's on the shelves. This movie is bad. Don't believe the hype. I would rather watch Scary Movie 2 in a continuous loop than to suffer through this poor excuse of a comedy ever again!Definitely not recommended (unless you have a handful of brain cells).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointing Sequel but Still Mildly Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3 isn't as funny as its predecessors but its still has its funny moments. It all begins when roving reporter Cindy Campbell sets out to find a hard news story in the middle of television sweeps. She soon uncovers an outrageous onslaught of globe-threatening developments including alien invaders, killer videotapes, freaky crop circles and much more. Faced with conspiracies of massive proportions, and a crew of very strange people following her around, Cindy must fight to stop evil from taking over the world yet again. The plot is a non-issue here as the first two were pretty much plot less. This time around they focus on Signs, The Ring, Matrix Reloaded and 8 mile as well as many others just not as much as the previously mentioned ones. The first one was {imo} one of the funniest films I have ever seen. The second one wasn't as good but still quite funny. The third one is mildly enjoyable but its nothing special. Let's just say that I didn't mind seeing it once but I probably wouldn't want to see it again. The jokes are either hit or miss and the ones that are funny usually involve Charlie Sheen. The lame ones usually involve Anthony Anderson as he is very overrated. Why he keeps getting cast is unclear because he isn't funny. Anna Faris gives a funny performance and she's also kind of underrated. Simon Rex shows some potential as he actually wasn't so bad. Regina Hall also returns as Brenda and she gives a pretty funny performance. The rest of the cast were pretty much a bunch of cameos. Jenny McCarthy and Pamela Anderson probably had the funniest scene out of all the cameos. Their in the opening sequence spoofing The Ring and that scene turns out to be on of the more enjoyable ones in the film. Denise Richards, Queen Latifah, Camryn Manheim and many others also have cameos. David Zucker directs and while this isn't another Airplane, it's also not another My Boss's Daughter either. Its pointless to really analyze a straight comedy as the main thing that people want to know if its funny or not. Like I said before if you do like it, you probably won't really like it that much. In the end, I found it a bit disappointing as the PG-13 rating kind of weaken it but it can still be enjoyed. Rating 6.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part 3 with Zucker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's by Mr. Zucker, one of the ZAZ (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) Connection, but don't expect it to be near some of the classics the original trio conceived. The movie has some nice moments, but most jokes do not work. On the other hand, if you're a fan of Anna Faris (regular Scary Movie alumni until Part 4), you might want to add a few extra points or at least one that is.Of course even here it makes sense to know the movies that are spoofed in here. Ring being one of them, Pamela Anderson "home video" another. While not a great skit, this almost seems like the joke of the century though compared to Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan trying to poke fun at themselves! You might expect Pam Anderson to be better than Lohan as an actress, but you could expect Charlie to be better than that. Maybe he was running low on fuel ... Anyway, better than other spoof movies, but not really great</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely One of my Favorites in the Series!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the series took a different route after the Wayans Brothers left, Scary Movie 3 appealed to me more than SM2 did. Mostly because it spoofed 8 Mile when I was going thru my gangsta' rap phase. Another thing is that Leslie Nielsen makes an appearance as a dim-witted President. Nielsen is one of my favorite comedic actors since childhood. 10 years later, I still love this movie. It's my 2nd favorite behind the original. Anna Faris and Regina Hall return as Cindy Campbell and Brenda Meeks. Cindy is now a news reporter and investigates the crop circles that have appeared in farmers Tom and George Logan's cornfield. Tom is the serious brother to George. George is the wanna-be rap artist who begins to fall in love with Cindy. When Cindy finds an evil videotape, she has 7 days to live unless she can destroy Tabitha, the evil girl who possesses the tape. Filled with cameos by Anthony Anderson, Queen Latifah, Kevin Hart, Eddie Griffin, Pamela Anderson, Fat Joe, and many others, I consider this to be one of the best in the series. I highly recommend SCARY MOVIE 3!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In ten years time, the only Scary Movie I will gladly watch again will be this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as these not-so-groundbreaking comedies go, the third part is easily the one most shock-full of funny stupidity and the one that stands up to repeated viewings. It is the most quotable of the four and the one with the best story and characters, like that's saying much. But the bottom line is that the film is hilarious. It never lags behind and it always has another dumb joke, sight gag, reference or annoying kid being hit by a car up its sleeve. Unlike the first movie, where only the few scattered moments of cleverness were really funny, or the second which was stupid and lamely written like the writers' crystal meth intake depended on it, "3" has an abundance of dumb jokes - and almost all of them work! This can all be attributed to David Zucker, who does anything but live up to his name and shows really great comic timing. Without this, the entire script would be excruciating, but Zucker's clever direction (how many noticed Cindy jumping at the loud noise from a boat - coming from a different scene?) and the cast's talent make the film much funnier than it has any right to be. Call it a guilty pleasure or comedy gold, either way, unless you're one of those people who watches Richard Gere movies on purpose, this movie will leave you breathless with laughter. The movie has enough celebrity cameos to fill your average episode of "The Simpsons", a cast ranging from photogenic eye candy in the form of Pamela Anderson and Jenna McCarthy to in-need-of-a-hit actors like Leslie Nielsen, Charlie Sheen and Anna Faris, and even a little rap music to boot (and to please the 11-year old, 50 Cent-loving, white suburban kids). The film is not ugly to look at, and the various different visual styles and moods of the movies spoofed are well re-created, like the gritty, washed-out photography of the "8 Mile" sequences or the oh-so-ominous music in the "Ring" segments. The cast works well together; few people can keep a straight face muttering ridiculous dialogue like Charlie Sheen and who can play a dumb blond better than Anna Faris? Vertically challenged, leg-humping Kevin Hart steals the show, although "the dogs are acting strange" is classic.Of course this kind of comedy is anything but timeless, since most of the movies spoofed will be forgotten as time goes by, but we teenagers who were born in the late eighties to early nineties will forever hold this quadrilogy of stupidity dear to our hearts. Definitely more entertaining than its victims - the ridiculously pretentious "Ring" (2002), the lackluster mess "Matrix Reloaded" (2003), or even "8 Mile" (2002) (which I actually liked) - "Scary Movie 3" is one of my favourite comedies and, in my humble opinion, one of the funniest spoofs ever made. Laugh all you want. I am.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movies 1 and 2 had more Wayanses than you can shake a really big stick at. Scary 3 forgoes the Wayans factor and instead employs the Airplane! factor, as it's directed by David Zucker, part of the creative team behind Airplane!, Hot Shots!, The Naked Gun!, and other exclamatory titles. (Even Leslie Nielsen, who appeared in Airplane! and has made a career out of similar roles, turns up here as well.)So with that pedigree at work, it would be understandable if expectations were a little high for this movie. Let's check the scoreboard. Scary Movie 1: a lot of fun, did a very good job spoofing self-serious horror movies. Scary Movie 2: same crew, awful result - totally immemorable. Scary Movie 3, then, should be as good as if not better than the first movie, if only for the fine comedic chops of the director.SM3 parodies three movies, for the most part: The Ring, 8Mile, and Signs. There's also some Matrix tossed in for good measure - these movies are known for their kitchen-sink approach. From The Ring, you have the whole bit about the tape that kills those who watch it and the bit about the girl down the well; from 8Mile, you have the I-wanna-be-a-white-rapper bit, with Simon Rex perfectly pantomiming Eminem; and from Signs you have that whole aliens-are-coming-see-the-crop-circles bit. There are plenty of pop culture references, including an eerie stand-in for Michael Jackson.The problem is that the jokes are scattershot, as if someone loaded a BB gun full of humor but removed the casing, thus causing quips and pranks to hit some targets but miss others by a long shot. Movies like this that rely on a fast pace, physical comedy, and a script full of everything the writers can lay their hands on. And because of this reliance, these movies tend to be - exactly like their jokes - hit or miss. For every Hot Shots!, there's a Top Secret!. This is because the law of averages catches up to the screenwriter - not every joke can be funny, and the more jokes are tossed around, the higher the risk that they won't be funny. This doesn't mean it's impossible to have a rapid-fire funny movie - see the aforementioned Airplane! and, for you older-film buffs, movies like His Girl Friday that lived off the rapid-fire humor.The basic plot has bright-eyed TV reporter Cindy (Anna Faris) breaking a story about mysterious crop circles on a farm outside Washington. The owner of the farm, Tom (Charlie Sheen), is a former minister whose wife died in a tragic accident. Meanwhile, people die a week after watching a particular weird videotape. Somehow, it all ties in together.Sheen seems to be making a living out of lampooning himself and anyone else, and he turns in his usual good work here. At this point in his career, you know what you're going to get from Charlie Sheen. Faris is appealing as the intrepid reporter, exuding both charm and cuteness in equal amounts - but not so much that you'll go into a diabetic shock. Besides Nielsen, among those who show up for small (or even cameo) roles include Pamela Anderson, Jenny McCarthy, Jeremy Piven, Camryn Manheim, Darrell Hammond, Simon Cowell, Denise Richards, Queen Latifah (one of the few who rose above her material), Eddie Griffin, D.L. Hughley, George Carlin, Ja Rule, and a host of rappers, including Macy Ray, Redman, Method Man, Master P, and Raekwon. With all those recognizable, you wind up with a mishmash; the actors and rappers are overwhelmed by their celebrity (except for Latifah, who is clearly slumming) and are nothing more than distractions, for the most part.But even without the myriad celebrity cameos, this is just not a winner. It's not as bad as the second Scary Movie, but it pales in comparison with the first - and it's leagues worse than most of the previous Zucker comedies. There are some funny moments (including a hilarious wake!), and some fine physical comedy, but the film mostly falls flat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than it sounds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3 follows on from the disastrous Scary Movie 2, this time spoofing mainly The Ring and Signs. It involves a random plot to do with aliens coming to earth and the cursed videotape from The Ring with some random Matrix and 8 Mile related stuff thrown in. This one improves considerably on the second, and is to be honest my favourite of the series so far. It's certainly not great. Leslie Nielsen, though he's excellent as always, isn't in it enough while the jokes are somewhat hit and miss. In fairness, quite a few of them do (There's a certain scene in the middle which I don't want to spoil since it's that good which had me in utter hysterics) but others are too obvious, overstretched, inept or occasionally just a bit offensive. The movie is a mess (How did this cost $48 million?!) but perhaps that adds to its silly charm. It's pretty funny much of the time, even if it isn't particularly good in terms of plot or intelligence. However, as a collection of gags it delivers. Uneven, certainly, and endlessly juvenile, but not as insufferable as the second one and not as endlessly vulgar as the actually alright original movie.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3 (2003): Dir: David Zucker / Cast: Anna Faris, Charlie Sheen, Leslie Nielsen, Denise Richards, Simon Rex: Not as good as Scary Movie yet a tremendous improvement over Scary Movie 2. Strange circles are appearing in a corn field owned by Charlie Sheen that has the media believing that aliens are coming. This is an obvious reference to Signs. His younger brother off competing in the rap wars in a reference to Eight Mile. The premise is different but it regards the usual spoofs of mainstream movies including the ominous figure emerging from the well in The Ring. Directed by David Zucker who previously made one of the worst comedies ever in My Boss's Daughter. Charlie Sheen is well cast as farmer Logan who will have an encounter with an alien molded in the likeness of Michael Jackson. Denise Richards appears as his wife in the fatal accident. This is another reference to Signs but unfortunately there just isn't enough of Richards. Anna Faris returns as Cindy and now she's a newswoman. She investigates and comes away a married woman. Leslie Nielsen plays the United States President who sense conspiracy and he accidentally solves the plot problem in a manner of classic Nielsen. Simon Rex plays Sheen's younger brother who is subjected to brutal prat falls. Vulgar as expected but takes the narrative in a new warped direction. Score: 5 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A reasonable excuse for a parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3 is the latest in a long line of 'parody' films which lampoon either a specific film, or a genre in general. This time the franchise takes a pop at (horror classic) 'The Ring' and (sci-fi thriller) 'Signs.' The original Scary Movie was primarily lampooning Scream, which allowed the film to follow a single plot line effectively. However, now it tries to merge two different films together, the jokes (most of which are 'hits' as opposed to 'misses') may be there, but the story seems a little jumbled.It's generally the opinion that Part 3 of the franchise is not as good as the first, but largely better than the second. If you're a fan of the series, then you probably know what you're in for, or if you'd like to see either Signs or The Ring poked fun at, then this might be the one for you.Although, most of the main laughs come from the over-the-top hurting of a small boy (it's funnier than it sounds, honestly).</fullReview>

Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) is now a TV anchorwoman who wants to do hard hitting news. Her psychic nephew Cody (Drew Mikuska) has her best friend Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) as his teacher.

There are some random funny moments. I still like Anna Faris as Cindy. I'm not so sure about Sheen. This was before his meltdown and I still had some trepidation about his comedy back then.

		<fullReview>Scary Movie officially entered into the realm of P.G, but I actually thought it was relatively OK for what it was. You get what you deserve when you decide to watch these movies (Except for Scary Movie 2; nobody deserves that on their worst day) It spoofs things like Signs, The Ring, and even 8 Mile, and manages to connect them altogether. Familiar faces such as Charlie Sheen, Pamela Anderson &amp; Jenny McCarthy (relegated to cameos in the beginning) and Leslie Nielsen show up here and it was a lot of fun to see. The old dependable like Anna Farris &amp; Regina Hall deliver big time. Anna did her usual shtick and it was a delight to watch whilst her chemistry with Regina was on. Charlie Sheen also does this all with a straight face and he was a hoot! Gotta love Charlie; Simon Rex is hilarious as our awkward hero George. Drew Mikuska is in many of my favorite scenes. He was a riot as Anna Farris's kid. Anthony Anderson &amp; Kevin Hart didn't add much to the proceedings in my view, though. I also didn't find the 8 mile spoof very funny at all. It came across as extremely flat. A lot of the movie did, but it also had its share of hits as well. Keep an eye out for a Denise Richards cameo. Final Thoughts: I thought it was OK for what it was. It certainly isn't a laugh riot, or nearly as good as the original, but I managed to get some low brow chuckles from it. I would rank it as second best in the series, personally5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3 (2003) * 1/2 (out of 4) The third film in the popular series finds Cindy (Anna Faris) working as a newswoman and discovering a mysterious video tape where if you watch it you get a phone call that you'll be dead in a week. Could this tape be connected to the farmer (Charlie Sheen) who has crop circles in his fields? SCARY MOVIE 3 will probably be enjoyed by those who enjoyed the first two but I must say that this here is another disappointing entry. I'm sure there are people out there who really love this type of film but I must admit that it's pretty much lost on me. For the most part this entire film just spoofs THE RING and SIGNS but it doesn't do either of them much justice. The stuff dealing with THE RING is never funny no matter what kind of joke they're going after. It could be the water coming out of the television, the psychic getting into a fight with the girl or anything else. Everything dealing with the spoof is rather unfunny and that's not a good thing when you consider that 60% of the running time is devoted to THE RING. The stuff with SIGNS really isn't any better but there are a few funny moments at the end once the aliens do arrive. Don't even get me started on the opening sequence with Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy as it's just downright bad. The one big difference in this film is that we're given some pretty well-known people including Sheen. It's funny to see him in something like this but sadly he isn't given too much to work with. The same is true for Leslie Nielsen and the various cameos including George Carlin, Denise Richards, Queen Latifah and Eddie Griffin. The movie has a few funny moments scattered throughout but sadly the majority of the jokes just miss their mark.</fullReview>

It was all rather cliché and slapstick, but at the same time it was well done, fast paced, irreverent, sort of fun, and quite unpredictable. Appearing in the film are a number of good comedians and off-the-wall personalities. I enjoyed Scary Movie 1, way back when, and it was interesting to catch up with the series.

		<fullReview>In the Scary Movie franchise, you have to turn your brain off when entering the theater. This third entry is no different, although it has been dialed down to a PG-13 level to attract a younger audience. This made me extremely skeptical when going to see this, but since it had Charlie Sheen, I gave it a chance, and I'm glad I did. The first Scary Movie had a few scenes where I cried, I was laughing so hard. The second didn't quite reach that level, but was a decent enough time-passer. This entry has a couple of monstrous laughs, and constant chuckles throughout. It's consistently funny, although some of the jokes miss completely, there are so many gags it's barely even noticeable. The special effects are terrible, but it doesn't matter here.One thing I really like about this movie, is that there are so many familiar faces in the cast. Of course, Anna Faris and Regina Hall return, added to the cast are Charlie Sheen, Leslie Nielsen, Anthony Anderson, George Carlin, Queen Latifah, and Eddie Griffin. It's fun to see so many good actors come together in a silly meaningless comedy like this.Even though it's dialed down in terms of crude sex jokes, this movie isn't any less funny than the first, and hands down, it's way better than the second. 7/10</fullReview>

The story is largely thin and predictable for it's own good and the pacing is uneven with the beginning rushed and gets a little too slow.The cast is the one of the few redeeming qualities. Anna Faris gives out her best performance and is done vastly better than the previous two. The rest of the actors, including Charlie Sheen, Anthony Anderson, and Queen Latifah gave some great performances so far. The production values is well-done and looks realistic. The spoofs are so funny with the 8 Miles, Signs, and The Ring being my favorites and the soundtrack in the movie is also pretty darn good.Overall, not as great as the first two, but I really liked it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to come up with funny situation that looks silly but done intelligently. This movie is (again) loaded with good scenes that's wildly funny.The casting is great, and they all play the funny stuffs to the hilt. There's not a moment something funny isn't going on. It builds on various horror movies such as I know what you did last summer, The Ring, and The Sign, and makes parodies around them.Charlie Sheen and Anna Faris is great in this movie. Other supporting casts are equally funny in their roles.A great addition to one of the best comedy movie series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sucky Movie 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third film in a trilogy is often considered to be the worst, so considering how lousy the first two Scary Movies were, I wasn't getting my hopes up too high for Scary Movie 3. Sure enough, part three proved to be a thoroughly woeful effort, completely devoid of laughs despite being directed by one of the 'big names' in the spoof genre, David Zucker.Although Zucker might have seemed an obvious choice to inject some real belly laughs into the Scary Movie franchise, without the help of co-director Jim Abrahams, with whom he created box office hits Airplane and The Naked Gun, the poor guy is clearly way out of his depth. The first two films barely managed a handful of decent giggles between them, but this one is a 100% mirth-free zone; I sat stony-faced the whole way through as Zucker and his cast of washed-up has-beens (including Charlie Sheen, Pamela Anderson, and Leslie Nielsen) went through the spoof-movie motions, delivering every tired trick in their predictable repertoire of slapstick and 'crazy' visual gags.And as if the total absence of genuine humour wasn't bad enough, the series' appealing brunette star Anna Faris had become a blonde! (raises arms to the sky and screams 'Noooooooo!!!!).I give Scary Movie 3 a rating of 2/10 (in all honesty, it should really be a 1/10, but I want to leave myself room to give an even lower rating to part 4 should it be worse).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the first and second one and I thought they were hilarious so I had high expectations for this one. With this film I was lucky as I had seen The Ring which made up lots of the story. I particularly found the ending very funny. Some scenes were a bit overworked and in some places I think they tried too hard to make it funny. Anna Faris delivered a superb performance once again, and Charlie Sheen makes a new appearance. The plot was as copy- cat as always and I also thought that the whole idea of the aliens coming down was funny, it was also clever how all the stories managed to connect. Overall I would say that Scary Movie 3 is a good film with some very funny scenes and I would rate it 7/10 and say it is suitable for anyone 13+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*1/2 out of (****)After the abysmal wreck that was "Scary Movie 2", my faith, rather than being restored, had been crushed for "Scary Movie 3". And usually, the third in the franchise is where it starts to dip in quality. It turns out this was an improvement over 2001's train wreck, but a lot of things are. Jokes are limited because of a more teen-oriented rating, characters are missing, and less boundaries are pushed. That's a fancy way of saying this can't be good. And it isn't. However, I do give the director some props. With what was handed to him, he put forth the best intentions. But no matter the effort, when your film sucks, it sucks. First of all, what went right? The leads that did return still gave great performances and still retained the charm they had in the preceding films. It's always good to see those familiar faces again. Not to mention, the film is eccentric and is always packed with energy. Let's just say, you won't be bored. And also, the jokes weren't too bad. There were some that worked.Now, what went wrong? Pretty much everything else. I felt that since that over-the-top gross out factor was absent, the slapstick element became the norm. A tip for filmmakers: Never resort to slapstick. It's not funny, and only serves as a distraction. Not to mention, the fans are torn because the original cast isn't back. What made the original powerful was all of the performers. When some of them are missing, the film just isn't the same. With a title like Scary Movie 3, your expectations certainly aren't going anywhere, and if they are, they better not be high. I will give it that the film has its moments, but that's why Youtube was invented. Stick with a rental folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A matured and diversified movie with great actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This third part of the hilarious series is in my opinion the best movie. For the first time, there are several parallel stories, essentially the ones about the alien invasion and signs in the corn fields as well as the story of a deadly video tape. This adds a certain amount of creativity and diversity to the movie while the first two parts have been quite linear and superficial. Numerous films are honoured in one way or the other in this movie from "Signs" and "The ring" to "Eight Mile". The jokes are much more diversified and surprising even if some of them are still quite silly and childish but one can say that the series have really matured in here and that they find their climax in here.Another positive fact is that many star actors are starring in this movie and not only more or less talented young actors. Pamela Anderson plays a stupid blond haired bitch, Charlie Sheen plays a pastor without faith and a broken family and the unique Canadian king of comedy Leslie Nielsen plays a hilarious and dumb president of the United States of America that makes me laugh in every scene he is acting, even in the very end and finally enjoyable ending of the movie that is not as dumb and all of a sudden as the ending of the other scary movies.To keep it short, this movie is really entertaining and funny and not only perfect for parties or young kids that think they are very cool that they have watched such a trendy movie but also for the cinematic lunatics that adore the more professional attitude of this movie concerning the enjoyable acting and the new and surprising diversity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3 is my all time favorite spoof movie. Nothing comes close to beating this with an possible exception of Scary Movie 4. After so many times of watching this, I still laugh hard as I can. The jokes here are never old. I loved the cameos and I was thrilled to see the beautiful Anna Faris return. I was also happy to see Charlie Sheen.This spoofs many movies such as 8 Mile, Signs, and the Ring. It tells the story of Cindy Crawford after she gets out of college and starts her professional career as a TV anchor.My favorite scenes had to be Leslie Nielsen as President. In reality, I don't think anyone would vote for him. He's so dim-witted and that is what makes this movie even funnier.Overall, this is my favorite spoof movie and it should hold that title for a long time. I rate this film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zucker taking over this time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first movie out of the franchise that got made without the involvement of the Waynes brothers. This time the movie is being directed by David Zucker, one of the men who basically invented and perfected the spoof genre. He has however lost his touch a bit the last couple of years, even though his movies still always contain more than a couple of hilarious moments, this movie included.I must say that this was my least favorite out of the series so far. It doesn't has so much to do with the humor itself of the movie but more with the handling of the story and characters this time. I think that the movie made a mistake by not restraining itself by purely spoofing horror movies but also tons of other movies this time. It gives the movie a more of an Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer feeling and quality at times, which just isn't the best. The movie can't really seem to decide if it wants to continue on the same way as the previous two movies did, or to take a whole different direction. It makes the end result a rather mixed one. Yes, the movie is still being funny to watch but movie-wise it just isn't a very well executed one. The movie introduces mostly some new characters but yet it also decide to feature characters from the previous movies. I feel that the movie would had worked out better if it would had just left out the characters from the first two movies and had just purely focused on the new ones, since they were obviously good and fun enough to carry the movie on their own. Now you more or less have two movies and story-lines, on which one focuses on some of the old characters from the first two movies, while the other is purely about the new ones. They try to connect the different story lines to each other by blending them in with each other but this just never works out very well.Charlie Sheen is the main new big man of the movie. He plays a large part and shows that he still knows how to do a comedy. Also Leslie Nielsen returns into a David Zucker movie again, as the American president. When he's given the right material Nielsen is of course still quite hilarious, though he's starting to age pretty fast now, as became obvious in this movie.Still a fun movie to watch but also more a mess than the previous two movies were.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third Scary movie in the series. It is also my third favorite. It goes Scary movie 4, Scary movie, Scary movie 3 then Scary movie 2. It was incredibly stupid but i couldn't help but laugh.Our favorites are back Cindy and Brenda along with a few new characters. The king of spoof movies is still going on strong unlike the spoof movies that you should miss Date movie, Epic movie and Meet the Spartans. This time around they are spoofing The Ring, Signs, 8 mile and The Matrix.The humor is mixed. Sometimes it is hilarious with its unpredictable moments and then it is painful with its terrible jokes that don't even raise a laugh.This is not as rude as the first two Scary movies. This might have something to do with the Wayans brothers missing. They have been replaced by David Zucker. I enjoyed his job in BASEketball and he does another good job in this.I recommend this if you have seen Scary movie 1 &amp; 2. It holds its position as the king of spoof movies. So if you are looking for a good spoof movie go see it. I will be seeing Scary movie 5 when it is released.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Scary Movie 1 - above average, quite good even, but not great. Scary Movie 2 - the film who cried potty in a humorous way... Scary Movie 4 - is it just me or is there some sort of orifice-related joke in every last scene. Scary Movie 3 - the only one without sexual fluids in. Let's begin.Now, in the larger spectrum, Scary Movie 3 is, really, a very good comedy. In comparison with it's *Insert genre here* Movie cousins, it's an OUTSTANDING film. Everything about SM3 attracts me - the blatant camera shots; the 'too-close-but-not-too-close-to-the-real-thing' spoofing material; the zaniness; Pamela Anderson's nearly slipped-out breasts. Whatever, it's all plain hilarious, in the way it exists, or the way that it's executed.My personal favourite points have gotta be 1.) when the aliens are walking by in 'shocking' videos (shocking meant to be for the aliens; where in the foreground are far more shocking things i.e. Dogs humping, people puking,) etc. and 2.) when one of the guys pumps a shovel like a shotgun (caps n' all).Well in closure to this brief review from a some shattered bloke, Scary Movie 3 is my favourite of the as-yet, quadrilogy, and will hopefully be yours ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing the second and the third movie in the Scary Movie series short after each other, gave me the perfect opportunity to see what the change of director can do to a movie. I liked the first movie, but didn't find the second one worth another watch, because they had lost all originality or sense of good humor. All they did was badly repeating what had worked in the first movie and that is something that should be avoided at all time. Now with David Zucker as the director, the man who also gave us some other excellent parodies like "Airplane!" and "The Naked Gun", instead of Keenen Ivory Wayans, I had some good hopes again. And he certainly didn't disappoint me...Of course you'll recognize several famous movies again. This time they are making fun of "The Ring", "Signs", "8 Mile",... but also other aspects from showbiz will be treated. You'll find Michael Jackson and references to the sex tape with Pamela Anderson in it as well, but the main difference with "Scary Movie 2" is that this time it all has been written into one solid and hilarious story. And the story isn't the only thing that has been improved, so has the acting. With some famous actors like Charlie Sheen and Leslie Nielsen, who both have a solid record full of humorous TV-series and / or movies, you know that you can expect the best of the best again when it comes to this kind of humor. But people like for instance Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy were an excellent surprise and did give this movie something extra. I'm not saying that they had some very difficult roles, but what they did really worked and that's all I'm asking.Overall this movie is a lot better than the previous one. Once again it is full references to other movies, but it is the humor that makes the difference. It's probably because they have chosen a new director and have taken more time to come up with a new story, that the concept works again. I'm looking forward to "Scary Movie 4" and give this one a solid 7.5/10, perhaps even an 8/10.Rated PG-13 for Slapstick Humor, Profanity and Sexual Situations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary movie 3 consists of the following: 1) Bad acting: Except for Queen Latifah and the girl who plays the teacher, all the other stars have nauseating acting. Anna Faris, the main lead lady, acts terrible and doesn't really know what the word ' acting' is. Pam and Jenn, who have a short role in the film, play it so badly that even a puke bag besides you won't help. The two main actors are somewhat better and funnier, but still their acting is garbage. The two children in the movie are expressionless and can be still deemed as extras who were just picked up to do the role.2) Loud jokes: Many of the jokes are loud and are graphically shown or are just actions like falling down from somewhere. THe number of witty lines are less.3) Oddest storyline: Taking the aid of four to five spoofs, the directors and the writers have created one of the oddest stories ever which is terribly childish and immature.4) Unnecessary: Some of the scenes of vulgarity and some nudity were just added without any reason just as an attraction for the audience, at least some of the audience.But even though this movie has all these characteristics that normally would be evaluated to form a flop movie, Scary movie 3 still makes you laugh at the loud jokes, some of them which are really hilarious. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3 (2003, Dir. David Zucker) A mysterious killer video tape is circulating around. One look at this tape and you have seven days left to live. News Reporter Cindy Campbell witnesses this video tape and tries to work out a way to prevent her death. But this is not the only mystery to appear. Crop circles have been appearing in the local farm of Tom and George. With help from Aunt Shaneequa, Cindy suspects that the aliens may be linked with the killer tape and must now work out both mysteries before it's the end of the world.They took a big risk when assigning the third instalment of the 'Scary Movie' series to David Zucker. It was obviously that fans of the filthy humour given by the Wayans will not be 100% pleased, but i feel that there is actually an improvement in the film than the previous two. The only two stars from the previous two films appearing in the second sequel was Anna Faris (Cindy Campbell) and Regina Hall (Brenda Meeks). Although the characters of them both have slightly changed, it's still a treat to have them in the film. Joining them is a whole host of stars including Queen Latifah, Charlie Sheen and Leslie Nielsen. All of them are a pleasure to see and they all look to be enjoying themselves. The story is very flexible just like the other spoof films, but has an outline which you can easily follow. I feel the jokes are a lot better. The previous two films really seems to rely on sex and filth jokes. The jokes in this film seem better constructed and are a lot more smarter. The only problem i have with this film is the amount of rap included. The rap contest wasn't bad but the film really could have done without the appearance of them all near the end."It was the chair." - Cindy (Anna Faris) "Yes, the chair." - Aunt Shaneequa (Queen Latifah)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director David Zucker has redeemed himself with "Scary Movie 3"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, the new "Scary Movie" sequel "Scary Movie 3" doesn't scare up half as many laughs as the original "Scary Movie." Neither does it raunch out to the ultra-extremes of "Scary Movie 2." If you laughed aloud at the first two "Scary Movies," you'll probably howl just as hard but in fewer places and for different reasons. Although "Scary Move 3" doesn't send up slasher movies, it mercilessly pokes fun at horror movies that coined big bucks at the box office. If you haven't seen big-screen blockbusters like "Signs," "The Sixth Sense," "8-Mile," "The Ring," "The Others," and "The Matrix," you may find yourself wondering what is so funny?"Scary Movie 3" differs in other ways from its outrageous antecedents. The Motion Picture Association of America impaled both "Scary Movie" (2000) and "Scary Movie 2" (2001) on R-ratings, while they gave the slightly more sanitized "Scary Movie 3" a benign PG-13 rating. Principally, "SM3" bypasses scenes depicting the use of illegal drugs and grossed-out gags about sexual body fluids. Furthermore, statistics accentuate the difference. "Scary Movie" spouted the F word at least 20 times, and "SM 2" uttered it as many as 26 times. Comparatively, "SM 3" blurts out the F word only once! Interestingly enough, "Scary Movie" used the S word 29 times; "SM 2" used it 26 times, and "SM 3" used it 21 times. Keenen Ivory Wayans of "I'm Gonna Get You Sucka" fame directed the first two "Scary Movies," and he didn't push the envelope on social issues &amp; themes as much as eviscerate it. After the whirlwind production schedule of the uneven, but entertaining "SM 2," Wayans bade good-bye to the franchise his brothers and he had created.Brilliantly, Miramax replaced Wayans with David Zucker. Along with Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker, David forged the movie spoof genre in the1980s with "Airplane." Zucker followed up "Airplane" with "Top Secret," starring Val Kilmer, and then helmed the insanely funny first and third Leslie Nielsen entries in "The Naked Gun" trilogy. Comparatively, "Scary Movie 3" contains only half as many of the usually tasteless and offensive jokes, and the comedy doesn't seem quite as weak. Okay, they make fun of the lethal videotape in "The Ring" by showing a bare-bottomed guy sitting down on 'the ring' or getting up off it. The another difference between "SM 2" and "SM 3" is Wayans mocked current social ideas, such as the radical ideology of some handicapped people, while Zucker aims for the funny bone, for the sake of amusement without any need to espouse an ideology.Actresses Anna Faris of "The Hot Chick" and Regina Hall of "Malibu's Most Wanted" are the only survivors from the first two "Scary Movies." In the previous "Scary Movies," Faris played Cindy Campbell, a vacuous brunette "Scream" queen based loosely on Neve Campbell. In "SM 3," Faris turns blond to play a TV journalist modeled on the Naomi Watts heroine in "The Ring." Like Watts' character, Cindy raises a young boy, her nephew Cody (newcomer Drew Mikuska), who carbon copies the omniscient urchin in the Bruce Willis chiller "The Sixth Sense." Literally, in one of the film's running jokes, Cindy (Anne Faris) keeps forgetting to open the door for Cody when she picks him up from school. Realizing her error too late after she has driven away and left him at school, she slings her car into reverse and slams backwards into him as he charges toward her. Poor Cody goes flying through the air like a football. Not only can Cody tell the future, but also he becomes the target of any flying implements. Meanwhile, Regina plays Brenda Meeks, Cody' s teacher, and Cindy's chum. Sadly, one of these two survivors dies before fade-out. Anyway, Cindy investigates an urban legend about a mysterious, supernatural videotape that reputedly kills the viewer seven days after they watch it. Cindy tries to convince her boss to let her cover the story, but he has no faith in the story as a rating winner.The second major "SM 3" plot concerns former-priest-turned-farmer Tom Logan (Charlie Sheen of "Hot Shots") who discovers crop signs in his cornfields. Seen from above, the crop sign near Tom's farm spells out: ATTACK HERE with an arrow pointed at his house. At the same time that Tom confronts the mystery of the crop signs, his younger brother George (Simon Rex) dreams of being a rapper like Eminem. Predictably, the bubble-headed aliens arrive, and the dead girl with slimy hair and a cadaverous body emerges from the videotape to do battle with our heroes and heroines. Director David Zucker keeps the jokes, gags, one-liners, and slapstick flying thick and fast with no let-up during this 81-minute epic. The incredibly coherent script by Pat Proft of the "Hot Shots!" and "Naked Gun" movies and Kevin Smith of "Clerks" and "Chasing Amy," does a better-than-average job of integrating the crop-signs plot with the deadly videotape plot. Leslie Neilson excels in a cameo as a paranoid U.S. President who insists aliens are masquerading as humans. After making one of the worst films of his career--"The Boss's Daughter," director David Zucker has redeemed himself with "Scary Movie 3," a spoof that is not only pretty funny, but also has set a new record for box office admissions in October when originally appeared in theatres.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is the best of the Scary Movie films. It's one hilarious scene after the other, with Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) trying to undercover the origins of a mysterious videotape while her new love interest George (Simon Rex) try to solve the mystery behind some crop circles and the alien invasion. Somehow, the videotape and alien invasion are connected, and you'll have to watch this movie to find out how. There are a host of movies spoofed in this funny epic, including The Ring, Signs, 8 Mile, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Others. They are all executed well, with more slapstick, yet witty comedy then the previous two films, and more fun for the entire audience, not just adults. Faris, Rex, Charlie Sheen, Anthony Anderson, Queen Latifah, Regina King, Leslie Nielson and Drew Mikuska were all great. Even Michael Jackson makes a surprise appearance. The only downside to this film was that the love interest relationship between Cindy and George were not emphasized enough. Aside from that, a outrageous piece of comedy.Among my favorite scenes are George and Mahalik try to revive an apparently lifeless Brenda by beating the crap out of her; Tom dangling Michael Jackson over the balcony (a test of his own medicine); Brenda saying "The TV's leaking" as Tabitha's ghost comes out of it and Tabitha's ghost calling Cindy telling her she's going to die in 7 days; Cindy doesn't hear her and asks, "What, Willie May? Who's Gay?" So, if you are in need of some laughs and some good popcorn time, watch this film.Grade A-</fullReview>

I'm 60 (I can't believe it either), and this is a movie that makes me laugh out loud. (Maybe we both have a problem.) The first two Scary Movies were very funny, and, clearly, a lot of people thought them the best. The import, however, of Zucker as director, added, to my mind, a new, zanier dimension. Of course, I love zany, which is why I'm such a fan of Airplane, Naked Gun, and (hearing howls of horror from newspaper critics) Scary Movie 4. Mister Zucker, let there be 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Considerably better than the first two Scary Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Scary Movie (2000) was a misfire, despite some watchable parts. The sequel, released a year later, was one of the most forgettable films of all time. How surprising then, that this third installment shows to be the best in the franchise (the fourth movie is decent, but not as good as this one). Maybe that's because of the director, David Zucker, the king of spoofs, the guy who gave us Airplane! and Naked Gun.Whereas the Wayans brothers envisioned Scary Movie as a montage of unrelated film references added to very puerile humor, Zucker delivers an organic, solid picture, whose plot almost seamlessly combines elements from The Ring, Signs, 8 Mile and The Matrix. There are other rip-offs as well (The Others), but the story's main focus is on those four flicks, as it shamelessly keeps staging unmissable, hilarious set-pieces.Well, not always, actually. There are a few bits that aren't life-threateningly funny, mostly because it's stuff we've seen before, and done better (some of the Matrix scenes, for example). Thankfully, though, that doesn't prevent the film from being enjoyable, mainly thanks to a terrific cast, including Eminem-clone Simon Rex (very good) and Charlie Sheen mimicking Mel Gibson. And when it's a Zucker movie, could there not be Leslie Nielsen? Finally back after putting Frank Drebin to rest, the ever-reliable Nielsen steals the show in the movie's third act, playing the craziest president in US history.For once, the third episode proves to be much better than its predecessors. Those uninitiated to the Scary Movie series shouldn't waste their time: the fun really starts with number three.7,5/10</fullReview>

This is a different kind of Scary Movie. It relies more on sight gags and less on drug, sex and fart jokes. First viewing will produce belly laughs that you won't believe. The story is about our hero Cindy Campbell and her misadventures with a videotape that kills you. She's fallen in love with farmer rapper George (Rex) and meanwhile aliens are attacking. Well put together for just a bunch of random gags! My profile: ** 1/2 out of ****. 84 mins. PG-13 for language, violence and sexual/crude humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IMHO, best of the "scary movies"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so I can no longer remember anything about scary movie 1, and I don't know if I even saw the beginning of scary movie 2 (I doubt, based on the end, that I'm missing much), but having just seen the 4th one, I can say that this is my favorite by far. The movies parodied include: Signs, the 6th Sense, 8 mile, the Ring, and in the alternate ending, the Incredible Hulk. The alternate endings available on the DVD, altho shot on a noticeably much lower budget, were much funnier than the original. Perhaps this is because I had actually seen the movies being parodied in the alternate endings, but I liked them better. The "6th Sense" ending, which focused on Cody, was pretty stupid, even if you have actually seen that movie. I didn't see Signs, and don't plan to, but my friend informed me that a running joke in the movie, "swing away", is based on that. I didn't think it was funny, and I thought it sucked that the pivitol points of the movie were based on that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some really good laughs to be had out of this movie- and some points where you have to ask yourself, how the hell did this waste of time get included in the final cut? I think they could have trimmed 20 minutes out of this without blinking. The aliens were uber lame and not funny, well.. except for the finger. This film relies heavily on you having seen The Ring, The Matrix, Signs, and 8mile to name a few. The target audience is definitely a crowd that can handle gross-out humor and some boobs. If you feel you are too refined for such a venture, take your dried up self and watch an English countryside chick flick about the drama of the burden of it all instead.If you are in a crappy mood, this movie will definitely pick you up. IF you wanna laugh- watch this- you will laugh! Just not on every skit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People are probably going to rag on me but I like SCARY MOVIE 3 better than the first two in the franchise. This is the one I'm most likely to pop into my DVD player and watch over. There's just something about it's shear stupidity that gets me all the time. The scene where Denese Richards is pinned between the car and the tree and, after Charlie Sheen kisses her, he pulls a spark plug out of his mouth. The scene where Leslie Neilsen, as the President of the United States, looks at the Indian and proceeds to say "Hi, how are ya?", "Hi, how are ya?" over and over again. It just cracks me up. I also like the part where the alien explains how they pee out of their fingers. Leslie Neilsen raises his finger, says "So we aren't so different after all" and pees out of his finger. I know this is stupid humor but IT IS stupid humor that I love. I can only hope SCARY MOVIE 4 will top it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW! This movie is so funny! I had 5 friends come and watch it with me! Cindy Campbell, isn't exactly the brightest bulb on the tree, Not only that but she has had it tough: In high school she was stalked by a serial killer who also wasn't exactly "Einstein" either but this stupid stalker had killed off most of her friends. Then in Univercity: she was tricked into going to a mysterious house by her schools' principal to try to find the real business about life after death. Later she found out that their was a story behind this house and a ghost who seemed to be pretty desperate..... But now... there's more.... she is taking care of her nephew who is a physic and likes to spread his visions around. Her friend Brenda Meeks who returns from the dead every movie tells her about a killer videotape that kills everyone who watches it in " 7 days" Brenda is again "killed off" and Cindy becomes desperate for love to find herself in the arms of George, and his elevator doesn't reach the top either. Ailens start showing up and so do crop circles but nobody knows what could happen after that funny old man, Leslie Neilson, shows up as " the President". (I don't know who would vote for such an idiot to become the leader of their country, but HEY look who is running the US right now) Any movie that can make such a funny storyline and script out of such movies as The Ring, Signs and 8 Mile is definitely a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't find this movie all that funny on first viewing it. Fortunately, it's been played to death on premium movie channels and it just keeps getting funnier.To appreciate this movie, you really have to have seen "Signs" and "The Ring". You can skip "8 Mile" and "The Matrix" (as if anybody has).Like "Airplane", the funniest lines are often the ones that seem thrown away ("I'm going to need a ride home.") All of the telephone conversations are hilarious and I can quote them all from memory.Highly recommended if you enjoyed "Airplane"...but make sure you have seen "8 Mile" and "Signs" first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers?If you liked Scary Movie one and two, you would like this one, two. Cindy Campell returns, firing up the screen with a great performance. The plot is very strange, but it will add even more humor to the screen. When people begin to watch an evil killing videotape, Cindy Campell tries to save the earth from danger and aliens attacking the planet. After you watch this videotape, the phone rings and someone says you will die in seven days. The videotape tells of an evil daughter is taken home by her foster parents. She unleashes her evilness onto them, so the mother drowns her in a well. The father videotapes it, and takes it to blockbuster when he thinks he's returning something else. Many years later, people start getting copies, (but they don't know it's evil), and they begin to die because the daughter has rose from the dead and comes out of the well. Saven days after watching the movie, the daughter comes out of the TV and kills it's watcher. The fist time you see her come out, it is hilarious--the person there actually fights the daughter. Meanwhile, as Cindy worries with that, President Harris is having his own problems with an alien invasion! A well-deserved 9/10</fullReview>

Simon Rex is very good in this role.

		<shortDescription>Scary- NO. A Movie- YES. Part 3? YES</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to this film after getting back from the Gulf. I had not seen a film for three years and felt like I needed to unwind a little, as I was pretty stressed as you can probably imagine.I was immediately struck by the charming Anna Faris. Has this girl got the cutest face or what- certainly a change than the desolate looks I had been used to in the preceeding 3 years! I decided to find out more about this young lady and came across an incredible coincidence- she is 17 days older than me! Unbelievable. I might even join a fan club if such a thing exists.Anyway, on to the film itself. It is basically a parody of several films I have not seen, such as Signs, 8 Mile and Ring. I could not comment on the accuracy of the parody but guess it's pretty spot on as people around me were shouting- "its like that bit on Signs!" and other similar stuff. The film is directed with a devil-may-care attitude, jokes are fired at you like bullets from an Iraqi bunker! If there is a problem with the film its probably that many of the jokes will be missed when you are busy laughing at the previous joke, or even the joke before that.Mr Sheen polishes up on laughs in this film, even surpassing his performance in Hot Shots part Deux. He is truly a master of comedy timing, able to wring laughs from even the most jaded cinemagoer- a talent he no doubt perfected during his wilder years.Finally, I feel I must mention Leslie Nielson. I don't want to waste words here- the guy is funny. Thats it. Funny.In summary, the title of the film is 66.6% correct, but that is irrelevant if you want a good laugh. I'm going to watch Jarhead now. See you soon!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was a big improvement to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start this review off, I will say that I hated the first Scary Movie. It had a few funny parts, but it was too sick and I wanted to make myself reach for the 'Power' button on my PS2. When my friend showed this to me, I wasn't too excited. Yet, I thought this film was good- well, at least decent.Scary Movie 3 is an improvement. It now has less stereotyping, and less sick jokes. (Thanks to the PG-13 rating.) It replaces them with more funny jokes that were made without a huge effort.The jokes that come this time around are probably stupid and silly, but actually pretty funny. The jokes have less sexual references and concentrate more on making something silly out of what would normally be serious.Becca: No. Not that tape. The one with all the scary images, and after you watch the tape, the phone rings and this really scary voice comes on and says you're gonna die in like...Kate: Seven days! Yeah, I saw that one with Josh last weekend! Becca: You were with Josh last weekend? The film is also packed with tons of slapstick humor, which is a nice addition, because it allows the audience to laugh without worrying about their brain cells. I liked the part where George (I think that's his name) hears screaming, and immediately gets up from his bed, causing him to hit his head on the lamp and fall back into his bed.Of course, the film isn't full of one-line jokes. It has some over-drawn and crappy jokes too. I really hated the Michael Jackson joke, which was somewhere near the end. It lowers the film and it lowers Michael. I thought the joke with Simon was kind of degrading too.I also thought that the whole 8-Mile parody should have been left out. The stereotyping from the first film has been lessened, but not fully abolished.Sure, there are some good jokes, but some bad ones are there too. Well, I do think that the writers and director of this movie certainly did a better job with this, than they did with most of their other movies, such as White Chicks, the original Scary Movie and My Bosses Daughter.Parodies include: The Ring, The Sixth Sense, The Matrix, and SignsGood: It's less stupid, less sick and has less stereotyping. Also, Pamela Anderson fans will like the opening sequence.Bad: Still some stereotyping, with some lame, over-drawn and un-funny jokes.</fullReview>

Well there are some things that everybody must know before watching this movie: 1. Everybody must have watched the "original movies" - "Signs", "The Ring", "The 8 Mile" and "The Matrix". If you don't see these movies you won't understand "Scary Movie 3" 2. We are not expecting an amazingly good play of the actors. We want to laugh! The main point of the movie is to make the serious movies not so dramatic or terrifying. For example a friend of mine has first watched "Scary Movie 3" Of course she said that it is unbelievably stupid. After she watched "The Ring" and "The village" and she understood the movies. And further more the movies didn't look so scary. So in conclusion i can say that this movie is a parody and it is not for everybody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Scary Movie is far superior to the sub-par Scary Movie 2. The main reason for this is that: 1. The Wayans Brothers were replaced by David Zucker (of Airplane and Naked Gun fame). Although I enjoyed the Wayans Brothers first Scary Movie film - they were too raunchy for my taste unlike David Zucker (whose gags and jokes in the aforementioned films he did were funny because of well thought-out without resorting to being overly perverted and raunchy).2. The filmmakers had time to actually come up with a stronger script (they had 2 years to do this film versus only 1 year between Scary Movie 1 and 2).3. The filmmakers decided to keep Anna Faris (Cindy Campbell) and Regina Hall (Brenda Meeks) as continuity from the first two films - they are the reason the films are funny.4. The filmmakers got Leslie Neilsen! He's a riot as the aloof President Harris.Overall, this is almost as good as the first Scary Movie film. A strong 7 out of 10.I can't wait for Scary Movie 4 to come out in 2006!</fullReview>

Overall, it was a slow build and then it got more funny though it really didn't have the same feel without the cast from the first two movies.Leslie Nielson and Charlie Sheen did help the movie along. A lot of the jokes were definitely predictable. I watched it for lack of something better to watch.To really get the movie, it helps to have watched Signs and The Ring. Other movies it parodies include: The Sixth Sense, 8 Mile, The Others, and the Matrix movies.

I saw comments of Scary Movie 2 that, yeah, loved the first one, but this one sucked, so I didn't see it until cable and it was hilarious. By which time I'd decided to ignore what anyone else said, until I heard this one had a different director and writers, which caused me to once again wait until it hit cable. And it's pretty hilarious, although perhaps not quite as much so as the first two.These movies are all pretty hit and miss, so there are plenty of misfires, most notably an absolutely atrocious scene at a wake, but the movie is often outrageously funny, taking clever jabs at the most popular thrillers since the last Scary Movie came out. Fairly consistently funny and doesn't reach quite as low as often for humor as the previous movie. If you liked the previous movies I would expect you to like this one, and if you hated the previous movies I would expect you to hate this one.</fullReview>

Sadly, Scary Movie 3 is just a rehash of all the same kind of moments except with painfully toothless jokes that are continually reincorporated to dismal effect. Scary Movie 3 is not a movie: it is pure excrement.This is an exceptionally weak and lame movie carried by some big name stars.

		<fullReview>This movie is hilarious at points and insightful at others, but overall fairly forgettable. The second and third watchings dull the humour more than just a little bit.If they'd not made 'Scary Movie 2,' and this film held that title, things would have been better. The amount of parody could have been deeper because of greater time between films, and audience interest (namely, my friends' and mine) would have been greater as well. Alas, for that was not to be....On its own (ignoring the '3' in the title), the movie is funny. Again, not laugh-out-loud, watch it sixty times funny, but funny. It delivers hilarious satire of such neo-classics as 'The Ring,' 'Signs,' and '8Mile' to name a few, while also poking fun at the movie industry itself. And Leslie Nielsen's turn as the president is a highlight of the show. However, it falls victim to its own curse: it tries to make a sensible plot out of what should be a romping parody. The whole franchise would be better if they didn't number the titles (i.e., calling them 'Scary Movie,' 'Heck House,' 'General Parody #27G,' and so on would have been better) because numbering the movies and defining them as sequels holds the new movie to expectations it usually can't match.Bottom line: watch 'Scary Movie 3' but don't expect to watch it over and over again like the first movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insultingly Predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3 came across as the middle school would-be flunky who copied all the answers from the kid sitting next to him, and contributed nothing of his own. Scary Movie 3 looked at the Matrix, the Ring, and Signs (among others) and copied all the visual elements, minor dialogue, and even fewer concepts, but nowhere did I get the impression that Scary Movie 3 knew what it was saying. Example: SM3 copies a scene from Eight Mile where a guy throws up in a bathroom stall out of frame ? what would be the single most obvious joke to possibly stick in there? Multiply that times 300 and you have Scary Movie 3. Many of the films released now have a high (very high) degree of predictability, but Scary Movie 3 goes above and beyond. I really can't justify having rented this film when my friends and I have come up with more intelligent, more original, and less predictable scenarios while just shooting the breeze on a Saturday evening. I will admit that even through its predictability, some of the jokes manage to get some sort of laugh; however, these are minor smirks and chuckles here and there. Most of the chuckles came from the three original jokes and the two jokes that sneak up on you. Honestly, Van Helsing contained more (not to mention funnier) punch lines.I think part of the problem is the number of films (of varying genres) that Scary Movie tries to spoof. It just crossed the line to ludicrousy. It's like someone cut and paste five different spoof films together into one. Is the average film-goers attention span so short that Scary Movie 3 could not zoom in on a handful of films, explore them, and just relentlessly go after those few with all the on screen elements? We spend enough time here and there to get to a punch line and move on, but we don't stick around long enough to develop anything with genuine wit. True, people just want a quotable one-liner that they can mimic to no end; however, don't filmmakers realize that the line itself is insignificant outside of its context? Scary Movie 3 is a bunch of one-liners whose humor rests in another film. So why watch Scary Movie 3 and hear its contorted interpretation, when you can watch the film it came from and get more out of it?Scary Movie 3 would have been much funnier if it actually sunk its teeth into the films it chose to parody; as it is, SM3 just nibbles and spews. I'd recommend a trip to Denny's at around midnight, strike up a conversation with other customers, and mock a few films. You'll get the same basic thing in uglier surroundings, but more laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that i am more as a filmcriticer but when it's about humour i can't judge it really good because i think this movie was hilarious.It's stupid and redicealess but really fun.You have to see the movies they make fun off to think that it have a story.In the leading role you can see Charlie Sheen as Mel Gibsons role as the priest in Signs(one of the movies they make fun off)who just have lost his faith in god after a terrible caraccident with his wife and discover a sign on a big field from aliens.It's a funny beginning with Pamela Andersson in a joke-scene of The ring.I must say that this is the best movie in the serie and fun for sick humour like me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the third movie in the line of horror spoofs. Taking inspiration from movies like The Ring, Signs, The Others, The Matrix and 8Mile (What that one is doing in that list is a mystery to me). Being the third horror spoof in a short time it is nothing new, but still if your interested in a couple of laughs this is the movie to see. There are some nice cameo appearances, like Pamela Anderson, Denise Richards and Michael Jackson (Yeah right :) ). The comedy is as always very sexual orientated and the body parts are flying through the screen. This movie has even some aliens that come to take over the world or ..... But all things aside i enjoyed this movie and i give it a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not scary. Not funny, either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enough of reviewing artsy-fartsy films - I'm going to review Scary Movie 3! Here goes. The writers for this thing tried real hard to make me laugh, and in some cases I did. The only problem was that I laughed the hardest at the first scene (with Pam Anderson, which was hilarious) but it all went downhill from there. Charlie Sheen is usually great in anything funny, but it seems that in this film he is just trying to stay afloat with the weak material the writers are giving him. Still, some of his scenes were funny. The scene at the wake was both funny and disturbing in its outrageousness, but that little kid was just creepy and annoying. I wish that Darryl Hammond had more screen time, because his perverted priest was a great character. Leslie Neilson provides nostalgia - poking his head in the door to tell everyone 'good luck, we're all counting on you'. Kids probably won't understand what that's from. The cameo's from such black musicians like Master P and Macy Gray were unexpected. Send my regards to their bitches and ho's. To sum things up - first 20 minutes = funny, the rest, not so funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>General horribleness, in general</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something in the air. A phrase, an uttering; indeed a statement. It's what lots of people say about 'Scary Movie 3', and it goes along the lines of "Well it was no cinematic triumph, no La Dolce Vita, but oh boy was it giggle-making!" Hands up if someone you know has summed up the jist of that sentence out loud... Yeah, thought so, lots of you. Well I say "Balls!" to that. This film was so bad it nearly gave me Parkinsons Disease. I thought the first 'Scary Movie' was wonderful -- a very jolly, rude, outrageous type of comedy in the same vein that David Zucker introduced back in 1980 with 'Airplane', and continued in '88 with 'Naked Gun'. Oh David, how you have disappointed us. At least some of us anyway...The Wayans took their fresh approach to the generic spoof/farce/zany comedy routine and, with the first 'Scary Movie', made it seem wholesome again. Perhaps the secret to their approach was to make the sex jokes considerably more vulgar than the mild innuendos of 'Airplane'. I didn't mind that at all; I found it hilarious and not particularly offensive. The main thing that bothers me about 'Scary Movie 3' is its relentless unpleasantness. Despite its lower, PG-13 rating I found it offensive, which was surprising because I'm not easily offended at all. Certainly, the first film found Anna Faris sprayed to the ceiling by a massive gush of come after her boyfriend has an explosive orgasm -- those who thought the film went too far liked to complain about that scene (it's one of my favourites though). But surely it's not as objectionable as numerous 'funny' scenes in this 'tamer' film, such as one agonisingly unfunny moment in which a terrified child is left alone in a house with a malevolent pedophile. The 'humour' in this endlessly crass-and-not-very-funny-with-it piece-of-flab-of-a-film derives from basically two types of jokes -- tired gags about sexual frustration and violent, monotonous slapstick. There's no originality, but for me, worse still, there's no joy. 'Scary Movie 3' is just unpleasant and mean-spirited, styles of film-making that should not be applied to a silly, cartoon-like spoof comedy.Still, even if the film wasn't so depressing it wouldn't be funny because, as I have said, there's no good jokes in it. Well, no, there's about two -- one involving dogs that are acting very strange indeed, and another involving President Ford. At the film's running length, that basically works out at one funny joke for every 40 minutes. Oh dear...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Genre: Horror/Comedy/MysteryRated PG-13 for Pervasive Crude and Sexual Humor, Language, Comic Violence and Drug ReferencesStar Rating: **** out of 5In this third installment of the Scary Movie franchise, Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) is now out of college and is now a TV news anchorwoman. Strange things begin to occur when crop circles appear on Tom Logan's (Charlie Sheen) farm, but the suspense climaxes when Cindy's best friend Brenda (Regina Hall) dies an eerie death somehow relating to a killer video tape. After her nephew Cody watches the video tape, Cindy fears the lives of all and takes matters into her own hands, summoning the help of the Oracle (Queen Latifah) and Orpheus (Eddie Griffin) and visiting a infatuated Architect (George Carlin) on Curlesco Island. From this point on, Cindy uncovers the eerie link between the crop circles and the killer video tape, and must eventually assist the President of the United States (Leslie Nielsen) in a preventing alien invasion. My favorite parts were when in the beginning were they were spoofing The Ring and I think Lord of the Rings and Signs. I also liked the part were George (Simon Rex) and Mahalik (Anthony Anderson) were at Brenda's funeral and they might of over-heard saying that Brenda was alive and so then they do all of these things to try and bring her back and it doesn't work. I also liked a lot of the other funny parts. It was a major shame that Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans weren't in this third installment of the Scary Movie franchise because at that time they were busy with another movie. But they were the writing credits for this movie.BOTTOM LINE: I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The whole point of 'Scary Movie 3,' was to have laugh-out loud comedy. I don't know about you but I was shaking my head the entire time wondering what did I do to deserve this. Some parts were cute, like the first appearance of the crop circles, or the opening blond scene. But man oh man, did Zucker and company ever struggle with the jokes.'Signs' and 'The Ring' get tied together as aliens get ready to descend on Earth just when a video is tied to a string of deaths.One scene they could have left in was 'The Matrix Reloaded' parody of Cindy fighting the hundred bad guys. But everyone was horribly stretched. Watching the video was a waste of time. So was the wife dying parody from 'Signs.' Include the entire '8 Mile' skit. Heck 95% of this movie blew! I suggest it ONLY to fans of the genre who like this kind of overdone schlock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're in the mood to watch a silly movie with 3rd grade humor, this is the film for you. The movie is surely not as funny as the previous titles, mainly because the humor is watered down for a PG-13 rating. There are some hilarious moments, but it's a different kind of comedy as opposed to that found in the Wayans' brothers offensive brand of humor. Pamela Anderson makes a cameo appearance in this movie and I must say that she looks terrible! I don't see why men find her attractive. Of course she has rather large badoombadooms, but her face looks so manufactured in this pic that it's disgusting.I would check this movie out, only if you must see every film in a series. If you're not that type of person, skip this title.</fullReview>

In `3', the film pokes fun at `Signs', `The Ring' , and `The Sixth Sense' among others. It does `ring' your funny bone a few times with its antics. However, it is not a good `sign' when the same old parody scenes become overexposed &amp; cumbersome. Even though I do have a `sixth sense' that its guilty pleasure components will be too much for you to pass on `Scary Movie 3'. *** Average</fullReview>

The trailer for this movie is actually better than the movie itself. I can't believe people actually like Leslie Nielsen, his acting is just plain crap + hes not even funny at all.

There really wasn't anywhere to go, not like the beginning of Scary Movie II with James Woods. This just didn't have much of a plot and the aliens looked like they were added just to make up for the lack of plot. Cindy or Sidney, whatever her names is, plays the completely clueless girl from I&amp;II and Brenda's part in this movie was also very good. But then it just kind of died.

Of the people of the famous ZAZ comedy team, Jerry Zucker made the very-good "Rat Race", Jim Abrahams didn't do anything after "Mafia!", and David Zucker became the black sheep, directing crap like "Scary Movie 3". In this cinematic tripe, reporter Cindy Campbell investigates a friends death probably related to a mysterious videotape (a-la "The Ring") and crop circles in a farm. Her nephew watches the tape, and she gets worried that he might die. She sets off for the origins of the tape, and everything gets tied together by aliens invading the earth. It spoofs things such as Michael Jackson, The Matrix, and horror films around during production. There are some laughs here and there but this film is mostly crap, although I seen worse movies (the worst being "A.I.", "The Animal", "Down With Love", and "The Matrix Reloaded".

My favorite part was when the little kid was drawing dead people or whatever and Cindy finds the little book of the drawings of the girl and she's doing like a little dance or something. I thought that was pretty funny, don't ask why. The best actor int he movie was Charlie Sheen. He had some funny moments. However, the rest of the film proved to be a little boring. Many of the jokes fell flat. However, I do admire the new directors' attempts to move away from the perverted jokes of the first two movies but it seems that they couldn't replace them with anything better. Overall, I have to say I am a little disappointed but it's still worth seeing.</fullReview>

And we watch it. And you know what we get? The most Hilarious movie since Dude, Where's My Car? Now, I not have seen either of the other Scary Movies, simply because before I watched them another friend of mine told me "If there's anything you don't already know about sex, this movie will clear it up for you." as she held up Scary Movie 1. That put me off. So I was VERY skittish about watching this one. You see, I think very little of movies full of sex, nudity and swears. I prefer something with good, tasteful humor, and Scary Movie 3 has it, to the greatest extreme! Watch it, anyone with a clean mind and who loves to see a good parody will be in heaven. Scary Movie 3, Quite Likely one of the greatest comedies ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say I loved Keenan Ivory Wayans' first "Scary Movie" (which was reason enough for some to dislike me for alone, but they can slavishly kiss my ass because they're too stuck-up for a cinematic good time). Still, I was way too disappointed by part two, and, by the time, I was watching part three, I had feared that it had all gone worthlessly stale. Surprises, surprises. Though this wasn't close to the first one, it definitely was good enough to spend money on (at least, as a rental), and I heartily laughed like a loony-toon through the whole movie. Some horror fans would view me as a betrayer because of this, but I love these movies BECAUSE I love horror movies, and because they take very effective snipes at the horror movies (as well as sci-fi, dramas, etc.) that I'm sick of hearing about from people who usually hate horror movies and view them as terrible influences. This time the leading bullseye focusses on all the "we're-spooky-horror-movies-that-aren't-horror-movies-brandished-with-a-PG-13-rating" flicks like the US remake of "The Ring". Well-deserved? Yes, I say with a mad cackle! So, simply put, "Scary Movie 3" may be numbingly stupid (because it's supposed to be), but it is one of the funniest movies out there and I did really appreciate it. The points where part two got too weak are generally out of the picture here, and this movie comes careening down the streets of the Suburbia of the Giant Budget, crashing down helpless cliches left and right just for the sake of pulling one merciless belly-aching outburst of laughter out of the viewer after another and another. It's a fun movie. Watch it if you're sick of taking things way too damn seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely funnier than the first two with the efforts of David Zucker. He has the right sense of humor to make a scene or a cliché funny. The first two movies, directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, are pretty weak and don't even give you a giggle. They rely mostly on a character's reaction, such as twitching, screaming, vomiting, swearing, or getting high. SM2's also rode heavily on white people acting like black people. This movie, as with the rest of Zuckers, relies on the characters to be funny. Drew Mikuska was funny as hell with his predictions and so were Simon Rex and Leslie Nielsen. Anna Faris is gorgeous and funny, too bad SM3 doesn't ride as much on her astonishing looks as SM2 did. I am definitely looking forward to SM4 or another David Zucker and Jim Abrahams project.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the first two movies of the Scary Movies series so funny and enjoyable, I was left miffed and disappointed at the third installment. First, it centers around two movies in particular, Signs and The Ring. If you haven't seen either of these, then make sure you watch them first. You won't be disappointed either as these are both good movies and much better than Scary Movie 3 anyway. Second, expect to see a dip in the "creative genius" of the Wayans brothers as the movie isn't a satire for as many other movies as the prequels were. Maybe you can blame it on a deprivation in source material as of late, but I don't think so. The ending is...well...lame. And as such leaves you walking away with the feeling the rest of the movie was shoddy. But not to be too critical, I did heartily laugh at several skits and appreciated the humor involved. Again, just don't expect as much insanely funny comedy as Scary Movie 1 or 2.</fullReview>

I have never really been much for gross out humor, which this series is known for, but I enjoyed this particular sequel. Jenny McCarthy was my personal favorite cameo. Charlie Sheen was good as the character Mel Gibson portrayed in "Signs". I'm also glad they made fun of M. Night Shylaman whom I can't stand. It was nice to see that they kept Anna Farris for all 3 of the movies rather than create a whole new cast of characters. With any luck David Zucker will make more movies in this series. I give this movie a 7 out of 10 so go see it at any price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the newest and in my opinion greatest Scary Movie there is a vast change in the way that the movie is run. As most people from this site have notices, the majority of the stupidity and gore that the first two movies of this trilogy had has now been eliminated and that caused the people who enjoyed those first two movies to dislike this partictular movie but in this new style it goes back to what a spoof really is supposed to be.The addition of the King of Spoofs: Leslie Neilsen really does make this film. Scary Movie Three is a glimpse at the glory days of spoofs (Naked Guns and Airplane in partictular). Neilsen's parts were the best parts of the movie and after he entered the movie it became the movie I expected. The first half was relatively funny as I enjoyed the spoofs off of Signs and 8Mile. Then after Neilsen entered the film it just accented it.Personally I did not think this movie reached the absolute elite of spoofs however it did most certainly register on the second tier. I give Scary Movie 3 an 8/10. If the new Scary Movie 4 is going to be any good it will require more of the same humor from Zucker and hopefully a return from Leslie Neilsen who is the master of spoofs and stupid humor.</fullReview>

Besides some silly laughs in the opening, this limp, lame sequel can't deliver quality laughs when there's more misses than hits. Great cast, many missed opportunities.

		<fullReview>Having seen the first two, I only watched this one because I was on a ferry and had nothing better to do. Much to my surprise, it was actually good, mainly thanks to Zucker's directing and the presence of Charlie Sheen and Leslie "God" Nielsen.At last we have a Scary Movie that doesn't rely entirely on puerile humour and gore - after all, sex, drugs and toilets are only funny for a very short time.This film was unfortunately let down by several tasteless scenes, presumably added to appeal to the Scary Movie 1 and 2 fans, such as the exploding corpse scene and the constant abuse of that irritating little sprog. Oh, and the vomit scene - I don't like vomit at the best of times, and in most films it really doesn't need to be shown.On the whole the humour was more subtle and more advanced than in the previous installations, and the celebrity cameos were well handled. Particularly amusing was Simon Wossname's cameo - anyone who has accidentally watched a minute of Pop Idol while waiting for Ready Steady Cook (or whatever, I don't memorise TV schedules) will be delighted to see him get brutally slaughtered.Since I'm feeling generous today, let's say 60%, in the hopes that Zucker does the next one as well - then it might even be worth buying.</fullReview>

Obviously we aren't meant to look too much into these kind of films, but it is meant to be a spoof comedy.

There were fewer deaths and murders in 'Scary Movie 3', and it seemed like more of a spoof than the first one, taking most of it's ammunition from 'The Ring' 'Signs', '8mm', and handfuls from other works. ('The Matrix', Sixth Sense')I have not seen 'Signs' nor '8mm', but I have a vague idea of their plots, this enabled me to appreciate the humour in the film. I wouldn't worry if you haven't seen them, but if you haven't seen at least one version of 'The Ring' (either the Japanese original or the American remake), I would seriously consider a viewing before attempting 'Scary Movie 3'.There are some good cameo's in the film, it is Leslie Nielson as the president towards the end of the film which allowed the film to finish on a high.Worth a watch, I felt I got my money's worth (But I did go on bargain Tuesday - ?3.50 a ticket). At full price I would still have been entertained, but would perhaps have thought my money would have been better spent on a slightly deeper film.</fullReview>

Tom Logan (Sheen) is a local priest turned farmer who is trying to keep his brother George (Rex) from becoming a rapper.Plot ends.Found this quite amusing but it is a bit of a hit and miss spoof.The TV Shows/Movies thate are spoofed are funny E,g,Simon Cowell (American Idol) Gets his comeuppance when judging a group of Urban rappers, Charlie Sheen tackles Michael Jackson (Yes, Really!) in his own way and Naked Gun star Leslie Nielsen helps out 'Da Hood' when aliens come looking for a fight.But the real scene stealer is Anthony Anderson as Georges rapper buddy who is always 'got his back'.***5/10The ReviewerFACT: Test screenings proved that Anthony Andersons charachter was so popular that the producers wrote and shot extra scenes for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonable fun, but very contrived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shamelessly so.Scary Movie 3 is the third in the series of movies which prove Hollywood can laugh at itself. It always features Loaded Weapon-esque spoofs of serious movies, and in this installment proceeds to wind up The Others, 8 Mile, The Ring, Signs, Sixth Sense and The Matrix. Charlie Sheen, Leslie Neilson, Anna Farris and Simon Rex are the main stars here with cameos from Simon Fuller, Dick Dietrich and a tiny one from Macy Gray.What matters in a movie like this is the humour level, and while some gags are spot on and genuinely belly-laughs, others are painfully contrived, spoiled in the trailer, or in appallingly bad taste. There are 2 separate jokes about child abuse and one about knocking a child over while driving.Moreover, the trailer features moments which aren't actually in the movie - the 'I'm prophesising' scene with Morpheus is absent.It's dumb, in places funny, in places just sick, and generally pretty messy. What else would we have expected?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not till the end credits did I find out that Zucker and Proft were responsible. I'm sitting there the whole time wondering what they would have thought of this amateurish, unfunny crap. Only to find out they penned and directed it. They sure have lost it since the Airplane! and Naked Gun Days of the last 20 years. I literally laughed out loud once, and that was due to the always reliable Leslie Neilson. Chuckled maybe three times, sat stone faced the rest of the film. So many of the jokes were too easy or plain. McCarthy scratching her ear with her foot; Michael Jackson impersonator's nose torn off; aliens who say goodbye with kicks to the groin. And the amount of violence against children! Sheesh. Hit by cars, baseball bats, shovels. A Catholic priest turning up for a sexual rendezvous. This just crashed minute after minute. I know the audience I was with was disappointed, as quiet as I was the whole eighty-four minutes. Yet this made a hundred million dollars. And part four is on the way. Makes me wish I could watch the "Ring" tape and get killed before its release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was estatic that David Zucker would be covering the next Scary Movie installment; I have nothing against the Wayans Brothers, but they always put too much emphasis on sex and fart jokes or any other obscene material. Zucker is more in your face with the humor, but the plot this time has so many movie references squeezed into it that it becomes harder to follow coherently. I recognized many of those scenes even without seeing the other movies. I love seeing Anna Faris again, but she is much more attractive as a brunette than as a blonde. Speaking of which, Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy are teamed up for the first time for a hilarious opener. They play sisters with a half a brain each and neither one is using their half. Pamela meanwhile jiggles through her scenes looking bigger than ever. Charlie Sheen is funnier here than when he did Hot Shots and Leslie Neilsen is here roped into this as a President of the United States more deluded than George W. Bush. Nothing is held sacred though as religous icons and the handicapped are parodied; the movie is trying to be a politically incorrect as possibl e as the satire needle jumps all over the place. The black rapper stereotype, however, is stretched thin as one guy tries to imitate Eminem. The boy playing the Sixth Sense parody goes through a lot of unnecessary abuse. The funeral scene stands out in the entire movie as Anthony Anderson fails to understand what a wake is and accidentally blow up Regina Hall while trying to resurrect her. The movie, however, ends abruptly, practically unfinished. Several of the concepts that were predicted didn't happen. Peter Boyle does not portray Frankenstein and Faris doesn't have any Harry Potter moments. I can only hope these scrapped scenes are used in the next sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3 was a film i was somewhat waiting for. I guess it was just the guilt of watching Scary Movie 2 and just hoping..Praying that things would go better for the series as the first film was excellent. Well as Scary Movie 3 played, i was pleasantly suprised with the introduction it was very well done with Pamela Anderson and Jenna McCarthy. Don't let that fool you though, remember the Classic Scary Movie 2 "Intro"-? We all know what happened after that. As the film progressed half an hour on i wasn't enjoying it so much, things slowed down, very luckily things started to pick up. Scary Movie 3 spoofed films like 8-Mile, The Ring, The Others, Signs , The Matrix and alot more.Now lets move on to some topics...Like the PLOT! What plot? There was none, then again it possibly had a bit more of a storyline than Scary Movie 2 and that aint saying much. There were a few laugh out loud movies in the film, but they were few and far between. Many jokes also were flat yet that was acceptable seeming it was a spoof right? Not quiet- this was involved with the Zucker brothers, they were legendary with the Naked Gun and Airplane series and this film is a prime example of how their outlook on comedy has changed- its just not the same.Many of the jokes were over-used and tiring like everyone being clumbsy, the boy always getting hit by an object, people hitting their heads on things, people falling over, people getting hit. It's just not funny after a few times. Scary Movie 3 had a great cast, fantastic to see Anna Farris back who is the only sign of promise in this trilogy. Some guest stars like Macy Gray, Ja Rule, Fat Joe, Denise Richards, Charlie Sheen and the classic Leslie Nielson. The acting was decent, thign is with this genre of film bad acting could easily be used as an excuse to simply be a "Spoof" maybe thats why Pamela Anderson was in it for a good 10 minutes. Lets check details below.ACTING: The acting was nothing more than what i expected it to be. Anna Farris kept her awesome persona in this film and really knows how to play Cindy. The rest of the cast did well, yet Leslie Nielson seemed somewhat tired of his role. Pamela Anderson was there, and she DID Act- but note there was plenty of Clevage coming from her to keep you male critics all hush hush.ACTORS: The cast in Scary Movie 3 had to have to best casting out of the entire series. Although there are no signs of the Wayan Brothers, or classic characters like "bobby"- things do change. The little boy was great. Plenty of faces in this film, most though are underused and have cameos, but that can never damage a film.SCRIPT: The concept is ridiculous and its like they just thought of the plot after writing it and linked up the 2 main spoofs together. There are quiet a few gags to laugh out but only a very few are truely laugh out loud moments. They put in too much of the same thing in this script, like characters being really clumbsy that got annoying. The ending was very TYPICAL and quiet predictable and why did Cindy Marry that guy after knowing him for around 2 days? Oh and BRENDA got killed again- don't be fooled though she is eternal.CINEMA: Cinematography was well..."Different". This film seemed to have a different approach, directed by different people and that really made the film seem different i almost couldn't tell this was part of the Scary Movie franchise, it looked different. The ring scenes were well done. Otherwise Cinematography was quiet average they did a fairly good job when copying other films.COMEDY: It was quiet funny but nothing you can call "GOOD". Reason being The Zucker brother could have done SO much better with the material they were given.Some scenes were hilarious like the Michael Jackson Incident, The Brenda Corpse Scene, The Blonde Jokes, Cindy being her silly self. Other moments fell nice and flat as i mentioned...Cindy could be clumbsy but why does everyone else have to be? Be more original! The boy copping abuse was funny once and twice, but not fifty times. It WAS funnier than Scary Movie 2 and i did notice a lot less crude jokes in this one.MUSIC: Not so much music used in SCary Movie 3. They used a very similar scene to Halloween/Exorcist. Otherwise there was barely any music to support the film, definately not a soundtrack anyone would want to hear or buy, i doubt it has any soundtrack they could have added some more music to give some scenes some more energy.OVERALL: Well all in all, i wasn't exactly disappointed at the same time i wasn't very pleased. Its a netural subject, if you prefer more slapstick spoof you will enjoy Scary Movie 3 more than 1 and 2. If you prefer more sexy, crude jokes you would not like this very much. If you like a blend of both you will find this film quiet decent. Of course it could have been better but i read plenty of horrible reviews on this film before watching it, and some people really need to study film. This is far from being "THE WORST FILM EVER". Take it from me. Scary Movie 3 had it's moments and it was better than part 2 in the long shot- and that could only be positive- don't be too positive though. Scary Movie 3 has a different approach to each person, you will know which approach you have taken after viewing it. Enjoy!** 1/2 (2 and a half out of five)</fullReview>

She is one of the best up and coming actresses. She is perfect in this role. I hope she dosen't appear in Scary Movie 4, in fact I hope there isn't a Scary Movie 4, but since this one grossed over 100 million, then most likely there will be.

		<shortDescription>Thought it was very funny, BUT...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I kept laughing all through the movie. So did the rest of the audience in the theater. Therefore, IT WAS FUNNY! The dead body in the casket scene was Over The Top!! Really funny!! The Michael Jackson scene was hilarious!! Queen Latifah was really funny! Spoofing Pamela Anderson/ Tommy Lee video at the beginning was funny. The bit about the Catholic priest babysitting the little boy was also funny. Thought the spoof of the Ring videotape was also very funny, when Queen Latifah went into the video and dragged out the woman &amp; beat the stuffings out of her for being obnoxious in the weird Ring video. I liked the spoof of the Ring better than I liked the movie "The Ring", which I really disliked due to the child abuse of the little girl.Some reviewers have gotten upset about the little boy being hit by a car several times, so I thought I would comment on this. 1st, it is very clear that when the boy gets hit in the movie, he is not hurt! Therefore, IT IS NOT REAL!!! In the movie "The Ring", when the little girl is killed and then thrown down the well to drown, it seems very real and horrifying. In Scary Movie 3, it is like the 3 Stooges hitting each other, very slapstick and non-threatening cartoon violence. 2ND, NO ONE SEEMS TO REALIZE THAT IT IS A SPOOF OF THE MOVIE "IDENTITY", which came out this past spring. That movie was a murder mystery slightly horror film, and twice someone in that movie died by being hit very realistically by a car at a high speed. ALSO, this same type of horrible death happened in "Final Destination 1 &amp; 2". So Scary Movie 3 is spoofing all three of these movies. Those grumpy grouchy reviewers who gripe about this obviously didn't see these movies, so they have NO IDEA WHATSOEVER that the writer/director is making fun of these other horror movies. It would be nice if people go see a movie making fun of other movies, THAT THEY FIRST GO SEE THE MOVIES THAT ARE BEING MADE FUN OF!!! Then maybe they would appreciate the humor in the spoofing film!The one real complaint I had was that I thought this movie should have been rated an R rating. The language was really gross and full of cursing, and I don't think anyone under the age of 15 should see this film. There were also sexual content and innuendo that I would not want my child to see if he was still under 15 or 16 years old. (He's 31 now, so I have no say about it now!!) :)I saw some 4 and 5 and 6 year olds in the theater audience, and I think their parents should have been arrested for child abuse, this was not a Disney cartoon movie for 4 year olds!!! My God, parents, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING WHEN YOU TAKE LITTLE CHILDREN TO THESE MOVIES???? AND THEN AMERICA WONDERS WHERE ALL THE PSYCHOS COME FROM WHO SHOW UP DERANGED AND CRAZY ON THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW!!! They had parents who were stupid and could care less about their children, who drag their kids to violent and vulgar and sexually perverse movies, that is where they come from. But this movie is very funny for adults, especially if they have seen the horror movies being spoofed previously. You will enjoy this movie better if you go see it at the cheaper matinee prices, not the full price in the evenings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Scary Movie 3' is an upgrade from the previous garbage that the Wayans Brothers brought us. Thankfully, we do not have to deal with their form of grotesque scenes, ridiculous marijuana jokes, or flagrant vulgarity. David Zucker has taken the reins as part writer and director. The director of such comedies as `Airplane,' and `The Naked Gun' brings with him an old school style at handling slapstick humor with jokes not based on grossing the audience out, but rather on simple high jinks. Although it becomes relentless at times, the film is ultimately far better than its predecessors. `Scary Movie 3' follows the story of Cindy (Anna Faris), now living in Washington DC, as she is taking care of her nephew Cody after the death of his parents. Meanwhile, on a farm twenty miles away, a man named Tom (Charlie Sheen) wakes up to his daughter's scream and realizes that he has a crop circle that reads, `attack here.' Tom's brother George (Simon Rex), however, can not deal with the issue at hand, choosing only to focus on his rap career. He goes to Washington to perform in a rap battle where he quickly gets thrown out. Along the way he meets Cindy and the two become interested in each other, especially since Cindy is looking for a father to help her take care of Cody. But the two have bigger things to worry about-a potential alien invasion of earth. Like the previous `Scary Movie' flicks, this one focuses on spoofing horror films like `The Ring,' `Signs' and `The Others.' It also chooses to spoof recent blockbusters like `8 Mile' and `The Matrix Reloaded.' Here in lies the problem. It makes sense to try to spoof a horror flick, as there are so many these days. Yet trying to spoof several films is too much to handle and the plot suffers from not knowing where to go-an evident problem in films like `Spy Hard,' and `Wrongfully Accused.' In `Scary Movie 3,' the scene that relates to `8 Mile' is not necessary and it becomes tired before the main punch lines are uttered. To spoof a particular genre of films, focus on one and run with it. This is why films like `Hot Shots!' and it's sequel `Hot Shots: Part Deux' worked. They focused on the stories of `Top Gun' and `Rambo,' respectively. The same is true for the `Airplane' films as they focused on spoofing airline disaster flicks of the 70s. Is `Scary Movie 3' funny? Yes. I found myself laughing uncontrollably at times. This can be attributed to Leslie Nielsen's appearance as the President of the United States. Nielsen is a comic genius! His countenance comes off as serious, but his actions are totally silly. In one scene, he opens a door and knocks an alien down a well when Cindy and George were about to attack it. Without realizing his own dumb luck, he simply states in his classic line from `Airplane,' `I just want to tell you both good luck. We are all counting on you.' My initial response was to applaud. As far as movies go, it is the equivalent of sending Neil Armstrong into space a second time. We find a fair off-the-wall comedy in `Scary Movie 3.' At least parents do not have to worry about their kids sneaking into an R-rated feature anymore. `Scary Movie 3' is rated PG-13, the way its predecessors should have been designed for. Why target teenagers if you are going to make an R-rated feature? **1/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, funny, movie. Only see it if you want to laugh.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was funny. Well, funny most of the time. Some of the gags are overused (in general, not in the movie) or could be seen by a blind man from miles away. Some of the gags in this movie made fresh old jokes (blonde joke, wacko jacko jokes, etc.). Mostly, though, the gags in this movie were hilarious, classic Zucker stuff. I say "only see it if you want to laugh" because frankly, the plot was so broken by the fact that they wanted to get so many parodies in. At first, "the ring" was the main target of ridicule, but that died quickly leaving one of the weakest plot lines I have ever seen to finish the ramaining bits of the movie. But, of course, thats not why you'd want to see this movie. As a parody, the third installment of the Scary Movie series, does it job much better than it's predecesors at getting the laughs. This ultimately means that it has accomplished it's goal whereas the first two failed to make the extra effort. Caring about a plot was the first two movies' mistakes. Overall, this is a funny movie that one should see when looking for a laugh--but not much more. * * * */* * * * * (4/5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zucker Gets "Scary"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third installment of the "Scary Movie" franchise comes to us directed by David Zucker, one of the men behind "Airplane!", the original spoof movie. Even without the Wayans Brothers behind it, "Scary Movie 3" often hits its mark. The parodies of such recent horror movies and thrillers like "The Ring" and "Signs" are successful. There are some signs the franchise may be on the decline, by casting actors like Leslie Nielsen of "Airplane!" and Charlie Sheen of "Hot Shots!", who seem to have a new niche in spoofs. But I'd say "Scary Movie 3" is a hilarious companion to its two forerunners.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's just not Scary Movie without the Wayans Bro's!!! This movie just might be good for those who did not like the first and second movies.The movie started off okay, but then it just went downhill from there. I didn't like the idea of Cindy being all grown up, they should have stuck with the College scene. Where the hell was Ray and Shorty? Those two made the movies what they were!!!!I shelled out $40 for this movie (2 tickets and popcorn)... for good previews!!!I give it 2 out of 10. There were a few laughs, but just not enough to be sired "Scary Movie"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third film in this series, but it really has no connection to the first two other than Anna Faris is back as the lead. The Wayans brothers who made the first two and their propensity for pot and sex jokes have been shown the door, and replaced with David Zucker (of "Airplane" and "Naked Gun" fame) and his propensity for pratfalls and jokes aplenty. Mostly a parody of "The Ring" and "Signs" with many other bits thrown in.. This one is much better than the previous chapters and has many laugh out loud moments. Some of the jokes do fall flat, but enough of them work to make this worth watching. GRADE: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well...i was going to wait till this came out on video to see it, and i wish i had, I actually caught scary movie 2 on cable the other day, and it made me yearn for more of the same, what i got was AIRPLANE on CRACK... i mean if you like Airplane or any other Leslie nielsen vehicles, then you'll probably be in heaven, but if your used to the usually WAYANS COMEDY, then you will be dissapointed, there was alot more Eye candy in this one which will keep young hormone raged teenage boys happy, which is probably why it was a box office hit the first week it came out. I enjoyed scary movie 2 ten times more then this fodder, and part one 5 times as much. Odd that the better of the 3 is part 2, but then again i always liked Halloween 2 better then the original as well..maybe its just me. The funniest part of the movie has to be the way the Aliens Say Goodbye. But that wasnt worth the 11 dollars i spent to catch a matinee of this with my fiance. Save yourself cash and catch part 2 again on cable till this is released on Video tape, and then Rent it, dont buy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How much can you really expect from it? If you don't go in expecting a psychological thriller and just go in expecting to see another Scary Movie, you will come out satisfied. I laughed heartily a couple of times. I DO suggest that you see a bargain show and not a full priced showing or for you lawbreakers, go see something good and then sneak into this afterward. P.S. Just in case anyone from the MPAA reads this, I do not suggest that anyone sneak into any movie without paying for it. Just stating what some other people do. ;-)</fullReview>

Why didn't they just keep with the same director(Keenan Ivory Wayans) and characters,like Ray,Shorty,and at least one character from SC2.All this movie was ,was a bunch of good movies wrapped into a 90min long crap fest.You'd think after all the cameos,it would make it better but it still wasn't able to live up to the first two.A note of advice,when u got a good thing going,and it makes u alot of money,stick with it.I guess The Matrix Revolutions is going to have to make up for this waste of tape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart, funny parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scary Movie 3" is easily the best spoof comedy since the "Hot Shots!" and "Naked Gun" years. This is one of the finest written, absolutely hilarious movies to ever reach the theatres.Obviously, I just loved the fact that they turned to the dry-witted humor genre, as opposed to the first 2 installments of "Scary Movie," which at times were funny, but were never clever enough to be considered hilarious in my opinion. They figured out in number 3 that less of the potty talk and more of the sarcastic, making-fun-of-other-films talk is the way to go.Based around "The Ring," "Signs," "8 Mile," and "Matrix Reloaded," it is hard to keep from laughing, beginning with the opening scene, which mirrors "The Ring" perfectly.This film watches the details. It is obvious the writers, producers, and directors watched the movies they were making fun of. I saw a lot more hard work in "Scary Movie 3" than the other two. It seemed like someone smart and responsible finally took over a movie series that has so much potential. This could revolutionize the industry because there are always new movies to go off on. There could be a "Scary Movie 15" in twelve years, and as long as the same style was used as in this film, it would be just as effective because it would have a completely different field of films to create parody from.People complain that there is no point of this movie, that it's just stupid. These people are missing the point. It doesn't matter if it has a plot, or a surprise ending, or great special effects. The point is that "Scary Movie 3" takes four films that take themselves very seriously, and puts them into a satire, that truly works. This movie can be corny in scenes because of its nature; it's not taking itself SERIOUSLY! At all! Like the Sci-Fi Channel classic TV show "Mystery Science Theater 3000," or FOX's "The Simpsons" and "Family Guy," this is comedy for the ages, and if you appreciate good humor, watch this one as soon as possible. But please, watch at least "The Ring" and "Signs" first, because the ability to relate exactly what is going on makes it that much funnier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well looks like they decided they wanted a few extra million by making a scary movie 3. It was easy. Write a five minute script, than fill the rest of the movie in with people punching each other and quite possibly the most kicks in the nuts i have ever seen. The jokes on them, no one is dumb enough to go and see that, right? WRONG. I am very disappointed that the world is letting a bunch of millionaires rob them even more. People can no longer keep telling me that if I don't like it i don't have to see it because you know what? With each piece of crap like this that makes 30 million dollars in it's first week, at least 30 others follow, and i'm pretty damn sick of it. A kick in the nuts can definitely be funny, but somehow in this movie they somehow managed to screw up every joke. Every time i thought the jokes would start going somewhere further another punch was thrown and another nut was kicked. Did anyone else not notice that the jokes were repeated every 5 minutes? Did i wake up in a twilight zone-esque world in which everyone's a big idiot? Where are your standards people!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is almost as funnny as Airlplane! In almost every scene, I either laughed out loud, or... well, i guess laughed out loud! This is hilarious. I actually almost cried in 1 scene... In this 3rd installment, Cindy(Anna Farris) feels that she must investigate mysterious crop circles in local farmers(Charlie Sheen) crop yards. She also looks into a mysterious killer- video tape that supossedly kills you a week after you watch. Also, she helps the president with an alien invasion. I recommend this to anyone who loves a spoof, lover Airplane, or liked the first 2 scary movies.SCARY MOVIE 3: 8.5/10PG-13: sex-realted humor, language, and some comic violence. Knowing that the first 2 were R, I was surprised at the people who thought that this should be R. It wasn't even close to R.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilarious movie in the beginning that gets old and boring near end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I sat down in the theatre with doubts for Scary Movie 3, I was suprised to find that the first 20 minutes were actually hilarious. So far, I was pleased with the movie. As the movie the progressed, I wasn't laughing as much and as hard. The movie has a strong, hilarious beginning in which you'll be cracking up so hard it's unbearable. But after 30 min., the movie will become boring and old and more of a stupid comedy. The parodies were taken too far. Plus, in addition, the acting wasn't great. Anna Faris was terrible, her constant gasps and voice got so annoying. That's just the main character! The rest of the cast acted as 11th grade miscasts in GIRL IN GOLD BOOTS. Would I reccomend this movie? Not particularly, but I could see how some people would find this enjoyable and I do see why it made 49.1 million in it's 1st week in the box office. It IS better than the first two Scary Movies, and will that I say give it shot. Go for it, it's worth checking out.It's just my opinion I disliked it. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was never a huge fan of the Scary Movie series, which fails to approach the quality or creativity of the Zucker 'Airplane' films, but the first two were like Citizen Kane compared to this. There were a few genuinely funny sight gags, but almost all of them are seen in the trailer. There's a long and curiously off-topic segment about rap music that seems to go on forever. I am not certain, but I assume the idea was to parody the film '8 Mile' but that wasn't a horror film...was it? Whatever its intent, it wasn't funny.Poor Leslie Nielsen looks lost in his repeated cameos here and every other star also seems to go through the motions. I felt embarrassment for all of them...even Pamela Andersen.One saving grace is the short duration of the film, which I clocked at under 90 minutes..and believe me, I checked my watch many times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like the first two movies.. don't go to this one-- you won't understand the irony. ;)I wouldn't have gone to see it if it didn't have Leslie Nielson in the cast. Also Charlie Sheen was a plus. A lot of the humor was slapstick (as you can tell from the cast), but that's just fine by me! :)I kept hearing people say during the movie 'I can't believe I payed money to see this.'. But I think they meant to say 'I don't understand the reference they are making right now so I feel dumb.' or 'I don't think it's funny unless it's vulgar. I wish it had more penis like the second movie.'... things like that.My sole complaint is that the movie didn't have a plot. No hint of a plot what so ever. The whole movie is just funny scene after funny scene with no coherency or smooth transitions. That wasn't a big deal though because the movie was funny. And frankly even though it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, it was better than a lot of the crap that gets made.Would I suggest this movie to anyone? I'd suggest it as a rental. Or if you really like Naked Gun and AirPlane then yeah-- go see the movie. If you're not sure if you want to go or not then I'd say wait and rent it from netflix.com.Good Day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...now, all you pseudo film critics sipping your coffees thinking "'Scary Movie 3' is bad because it has no metaphors. All the best spoofs have metaphors. If someone were to like this, they'd have bad taste in film" are wrong. Anyone who looks at my top 50 movies (including films like "Reservoir Dogs", "The Usual Suspects" and "12 Angry Men"...I'm 14) will know that I am far from having bad taste, and yet I liked this film. Perplexing isn't it?The answer is simple: "Scary Movie 3" is good. The jokes, spoofs, gags, and just about everything else about this movie is hilarious. And it would be, David Zucker made it.Some things I must point out: the spoofs about "the hood" and movie "8 Mile" were great. I loved how it made fun of the popular cliches of every black person living Ghetto-lifestyles and owning guns. After watching "Bringing Down the House" these jokes were a relief.Also, the spoofs of "Signs" and "The Matrix" are also quite hilarious. They offer lines like "They mastered space travel and they don't know hoe to open a simple wooden door?" by Sheen's farmer and "I've been in this room for a long time with no one but myself and this chair; I call her...Linda" by a goofy Architect-like character from The Matrix Reloaded.So, if you're not too stuck up about film and you want to see a good funny movie, watch this, 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Left no impression on me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that David Zucker was directing this movie, I was ecstatic. This is the guy who brought us "Airplane," the "Naked Gun" movies and even "Ruthless People"--which I consider to be one of the funniest comedies of all time. Did it live up to my expectations? Not quite. Just like a lot of comedies that have come out recently, it's another collection of stale, predictable gags. I did laugh at spots--hell, I was trying to get my money's worth. But for a Zucker film, I expect a lot funnier. I don't expect every single gag having to do with either someone getting hit in the head or children getting hit by cars. Since the film is PG-13, there's not as much room for the raunchiness that pervaded throughout parts 1 and 2, but in place we have nothing but cheap slapstick. The other movies were funny, but funny in a way that you laugh your butt off the first time, but by the second viewing the jokes have already run dry. After all, the Wayans aren't known for their large wits. So I was waiting to badmouth this film and go on about how David Zucker knows how to handle the spoof genre, while the Wayans don't. But in fact, the Wayans have handled the genre better. At least I got some laughs out of the first two films. The only two returning members from the first two movies are Anna Faris and Regina Hall. The latter I don't mind, though she's no Lucille Ball, but Faris is a terrible comic actress. I don't know why I'm reading posts on message boards, saying that she has real talent and she'll move onto bigger and better things. I already came to conclusion, after watching the original "Scary Movie," that her timing and delivery was totally off. She has the beauty, but that's all she's got. So for all you women who think guys will regard any beautiful actress as "good," you're sorely mistaken--or at least you can exclude me. Meanwhile, women regard Vin Diesel as a good actor, yet he couldn't slap on a facial expression if his life depended on it--but that's drifting into another issue. The rest of the cast is quite talented, but they seem to be there simply to add on more star power. It's one of those films where there are cameos for the sake of cameos. They're simply there so the young ones can go "Ooooh, that's Master P" or "Ooooh, that's Ja Rule." Leslie Nielsen has a small and unfortunately thankless role. After the "Naked Gun" movies he has drifted into oblivion, which is really a shame because he's truly a comic genius. Charlie Sheen has shown his knack for comedy in past films like "Hot Shots" and "Major League," but he is also wasted in this movie. He appears totally embarrassed to be in this movie, and looks almost like he's playing a caricature of himself. So don't get suckered--or should I say Zuckered--in like me. This is less on the scale of "Airplane" and "The Naked Gun," and more on the scale of "Baseketball" and "My Boss' Daughter"--other mediocre flicks directed by Zucker. If you want to see all the funny gags, just watch the trailer. As a matter of fact, the "I am Morpheus" gag with Eddie Griffin with him saying "I am prophesizing" and Queen Latifah as his wife responding with "I'm gonna prophesize my foot up your a**" isn't even in the movie! Is it a scheme to lure audiences into buying the DVD (with the deleted scenes)? Maybe. My score: 5 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What? A "Scary Movie" that's actually funny? Say it's not so!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many movie critics bent over backwards to heap tons of praise on the original "Scary Movie," a film that I felt was as funny as getting a root canal. In contrast, "Scary Movie 3" has received mostly negative reviews from the same critics who liked the original, despite being a much funnier movie.During the course of 90 minutes of silliness, "American Idol" judge Simon Cowell is ventilated by gunfire after giving a negative review to a rap battle, Michael Jackson (or a reasonable facsimile) is dangled over a balcony while the man holding him says "How do YOU like it?" and a news room bursts into a spontaneous football party a la a Coors Light commercial. Comedy is subjective, and instances like these will either attract viewers like flies or turn them away in droves.Television anchorwoman Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) seeks to investigate a mysterious crop circle pattern in a Virginia farm cornfield. At the same time, her good friend Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) tells her about a killer videotape that she has seen that supposedly curses the viewer via a phone call to die seven days later. Cindy watches the tape and gets the phone call, realizing she has a week to find a way to stop the supernatural killer from striking.The owner of the farm, Tom Logan (Charlie Sheen), is a former minister having a crisis of faith following the unfortunate death of his wife. Meanwhile, his brother George (Simon Rex) dreams of becoming a rapper and hopes to hook up with Cindy, whose psychic son has Brenda as a teacher along with Tom's daughter. Circumstances force them all to join forces to discover the connection between the videotape and a possible alien invasion.If you haven't guessed, the plot is a mix between "Signs" and "The Ring" with "8 Mile" thrown in haphazardly for good measure. The storyline is a threadbare at best, just an excuse to poke fun at the latest box office thrillers with a general vibe of goofiness and satire. In terms of coherent story telling, the movie is a train wreck, but as an exercise in throwing funny things up on screen, the jokes arrive right on schedule.What sets this film apart from the two previous movies in this series is perhaps the mindset in general. "Scary Movie" and "Scary Movie 2" were both R-rated envelope pushers, showing disgusting sex-related physical jokes never-before-seen in movie theaters. Comedy, however, has always been in the suggestion of naughtiness, and not the actual presentation of it. The PG-13 rating here holds the movie within a general safe bound, keeping the filmmakers under control and forcing the humor to focus on funny line delivery, not gross bodily functions.Not that "Scary Movie 3" skimps on all bodily functions, but at least it's nothing repugnant this time.Director David Zucker, whose credits in this genre include co-directing "The Naked Gun" and "Airplane!" is certainly a much more accomplished director than the series' previous helmer Keenan Ivory Wayans. His scenes do not drag on to the point of exhaustion though they still could have benefited from more editing in some cases. Camera action is more lively this time out too, as opposed to the static movement in the first two films.Acting here is not outstanding, but it gets the job done considering the circumstances. Returning for the third time, Faris has not improved her supposed thespian skills one iota from the first film. She's still the same brainless character who has no business surviving a horror movie besides for being the main character.Sheen just goes through the motions, neither quite satisfying nor upsetting viewer expectations. He really isn't the right type to be spoofing Mel Gibson's nuanced performance, but he does deliver his goofy lines with the appropriate straight face.Cameos and other small roles abound here to various degrees of success, including spoof king Leslie Nielsen as the President, who steals practically every scene he's in with little effort. Queen Latifah, Eddie Griffin and George Carlin all show up parodying characters from "The Matrix Reloaded," though it's obvious all their scenes where written quickly to cash in on that film and lack any other true purpose or meaning in this movie.Where "Scary Movie 3" ultimately fails though is ironically in the same department as the first two movies. What made "Airplane!" and "The Naked Gun" so great, as well as pre-Zucker spoofs like "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" and "Blazing Saddles," is that all those films parodied entire genres and not just specific films.All three "Scary Movie" films take the easy route by attacking current blockbusters, just like every spoof movie since "Spy Hard" has. Unfortunately, what is funny now will not be funny three years from now. The horror genre has so many conventions ripe for satire that it's a shame that "Scary Movie 3" seeks mediocrity in an already overcrowded market.Seven out of ten stars. Lacks the motivation and ability to become a classic, but still a fun romp on the old theater. You should probably wait until video to see it though.</fullReview>

Whats really good about this movie is that it didn't try to be anything but a parody which makes it all the more entertaining...and to some extent, not cheezy. True , some of the jokes might be corny, but as a whole I thought this movie was pretty funny...and to really laugh you have to have seen the 3-4 movies that they spoof....namely the Others.Also note that for some people who like teen humor, this is not the Wayans Scary Movie as there aren't as many of the usual gay jokes or racial jokes...but it's funny nevertheless. Scary Movie was funnier though.</fullReview>

There were some funny moments, like the beginning scene with Pamela Anderson, and Jenny McCarthy, and I even chuckled at the parody of the beer commercial("..and...and TWINS!!"), but this movie is littered with cheap laughs, like the aliens kicking the guy in the balls. Is getting kicked in the balls still funny? Maybe 5 years ago, but now it's just stall, just like the taste this movie left in my mouth.

		<shortDescription>So Why Was this Movie not as good as the first two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really suffered losing out on characters which made the first two Ray and Shorty made the first two movies hilariously funny, the wayans brothers had a way of making these characters that funny that you laughed when you saw them they didnt even have to say anything. ok so scary movie 3 wasnt a bad movie and being a fan of zuckers BASEketball i was expecting something more. whereas with the other movies they were dissing a lot of movies this stuck to a basic three. signs the ring and 8 mile, the problem with this is that signs isnt a horror movie or scary at all. 8 mile isnt a horror movie either. so the fluidity of the film isnt a "scary movie". im not going to say i didnt enjoy it or it wasnt funny but would have prefered a different name as it wasnt in my book a scary movie franchise film as it didnt feel like one.the reason fans of the first two would go and see this is for more of the same thing. instead we were brainwashed into watching a mix between naked gun and hot shots.if you liked the first two its worth a watch but its not along the same lines as the other two. its like making a remake of texas chainsaw massacre and replacing leatherface with a bunny rabbit(no offense to the killer rabbit in the holy grail as that is by far the scariest movie creature in the world)bring back the wayans for number 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>by Dane Youssef"Scary Movie 3" marks the end of an era. The first was a funny romp, worthy of the Zuckers (and Abrhams) and the Farrelys.The entire Wayans clan coming together, roasting popular movies like franks on a bonfire. Gay, sh*t, dick, pee, cum and retard jokes galore. It was near brilliant.The best part of it was that it was a collage of stupidity, cleverness, goofiness, vulgarity and pop culture, like the Wayans' "In Living Color," the first "Scary Movie" proves that the Wayans' are a tribe of talent.The second in the series, "Scary Movie 2" (after promising there would be no sequel-- Marlon was quoted as saying, "We sold out. The offered us money and we jumped at the chance"), opened with a premise so brilliant and so hilarious, the movie could never live it down.The ingenious opening on "The Exorcist" before the opening credits with James Woods and Andy Richter was a legendary moment in comedy. "The Exorcist" has been spoofed countless times before (many, many times before... but I can honestly say, never this well. The way it's written, the way it's directed, the way it's played, the way it's planned... this movie achieves some kind of feat for building so much out of such an over-worked premise. That one opening sequence almost makes the movie at least worth renting."Scary Movie 3" is largely a fault of the studio. The house has been brought down, the curtain calls have been had... but Miramax just won't find a new franchise. It's just so sad. Everything, EVERYTHING that was once good and pure is no long gone. Even the Wayans themselves. Zucker is just back doing what he does best... or maybe just often. This is his invention and no one does it better than him, but maybe the problem is the machine-gun spoof (called so because jokes fire on automatic like out of an automatic gun) has just been run into the ground. Maybe the problem is that this movie just wants to goof and imitate and and laugh to itself whereas the original "Scary Movie" (and a lot of Zucker's earlier stuff) was directly there to attack.You can tell from the ads alone that this will not be a funny movie. Everyone steps up, references big hits and then makes fun. Not in an attacking sort of way, but just acts goofy and silly. They're all just having fun, not making fun.And because it's directly from the co-inventor of this entire genre, he brings his own people to the table. Leslie Neilsen, Jenny McCarthy and many of the instruments that he used since he started out.You know, it's so funny and strange. MAD magazine can do this forever. SNL... well, USED to be able to do this, but it now it seems like SNL should close down itself. For some reason, some spoof artists can just keep going till' the drop. Others should just cash in their chips and quit while they're ahead. No sense in beating a single note together.The problem with "Scary Movie 3" is the same thing that's wrong with Miramax and perhaps even David Zucker. These people don't seem to realize it's time to move on. That it's over. They're beating a dead horse. Trying to milk a dead cow. The Wayans have moved on. Zucker, Miramax and we should, too.I look foreword to their next endeavors in art and life, whatever they may be. Their stretching, but this is like an old once-hipster jacket that has been worn down to a few threads. Enough already. Remember when the Itallion Stallion didn't know when to throw in the towel."Do you like 'Scary Movies?'"Not anymore.It's over.SPECIAL NOTE: Legendary screenwriter Kevin Smith, rumored to be one of the finest scribes in all of Hollywood is credited with this screenplay. What a dent in the armor. He's rumored to be difficult to work with. Maybe he just works better alone. I hope he sticks to solo projects, this and "Coyote Ugly"... no wonder he doesn't work well with others.--An Ex-Lover Of Scary Movies, Dane Youssef</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say I walked in to this movie nervous. I was nervous for David Zucker. I was nervous for Anna Faris. I was nervous for everybody who was in this movie, or anyone who was ever going to watch it. And so the first 10 minutes start rolling. And the laughs start rolling with it. I can't lie, so I must say that the opening scene is one of the funniest openings ever, right up there with Carmen Elektra's in the original Scary Movie. (SPOILER: For those of you who watched the 3 minute clip of this opening on the movie box, be warned that the real thing appears to be a bit rushed, and they left out the whole "You're beautiful" scene)There are a handful of parodies in Scary Movie 3. Most work (The Ring is the most successful) and some don't (8 Mile). I really loved the Signs flashback, and the alien videotapes. ("One thing is for certain- We are all going to die.") It is interesting that sometimes, the biggest elaborate scenes that try to be hilarious end up to be 3 chuckles. This is evident in the whole 8 Mile scene with Simon Rex, Fat Joe, and Simon Cowell mainly. It starts fresh, ends pretty boring. But the film makes up for it with several little clever scenes that had me burstin out loud (SPOILER:"These are some photos taken before Brenda died..." "They're blank!!" "They're backwards sweety.")It's these scenes that give Scary Movie 3 fresh air. I loved the part where Cindy searches for "Conesco Island Lighthouse" on google, and when she gets to the site, all these pop-up ads come up. So true.One big fault in this movie is the decision to kill off Brenda too early. She owned all of her scenes, and was one of the funniest in the movie.But we forgive david Zucker for doing this, and keep laughing. Overall, I give Scary Movie 3 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eminem once pondered the question,"What happens when bad meets evil." Let the pondering cease. This movie drags on like a midget hooked up to a low rider. It's willingness to over sell unfunny jokes is almost unbearable. There's a huge piece missing in this movie. Perhaps the Wayans brothers were needed more than the producers want to admit. This film doesn't even deserve a position in the franchise. They should simply call it ,"Bad Movie." Maybe then it could live up to it's name. Producers were unwise to believe that Anna Faris could carry most of the comedy . The truth of the matter is she plays second banana to the eternally unfunny Charlie Sheen, and the bland Simon Rex. Also the movies they choose to spoof were the wrong choices. Most of the actors chosen were bad. Only the few lone holdouts from the previous films were funny. Almost every single spoof either falls flat or simply is overdone. There are some mildly entertaining jokes and puns in this film. But whenever Zucker has a laugh, he tries to stretch it and fails. Instead of being one gag after another, this movie's scenes are often too long thus making them boring. The first two movies didn't wait in the water for a miracle like this movie does. They simple told jokes and did puns. The overselling of jokes is done to try to make things seem funnier than they are. It's old folks humor told in a young person's franchise. Perhaps Zucker is too old and out of touch with what is funny. This movie isn't just bad, it's evil.</fullReview>

Of the movies made fun of The Ring and Signs were used the most. Interestingly enough both The Matrix, and The Matrix Reloaded were both played off of nicely by Queen Latifah, Eddie Griffin, and George Carlin. And they were just a few of the many cameos made by well known actors including Darrell Hammond, D.L. Hughley Denise Richards, Pamela Anderson and the list goes on. Most shocking was the unlikely cameo of the `Power Twins,' former employees of Vince McMahon in the World Wrestling Federation. To make a long story short (too late) this movie was well done as compared to the last to rare and raw comedies that needed more work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Step-Down From Good Spoofs, A Step-Up From It's Prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3 tries to be original, but at times (which is most of the time) it isn't. The plot? Well it's not too hard to explain. In short: The Ring + Signs. It also tries to be bad while still being good (It tries to be "R" rated while being "PG-13"). Some scenes are sharp and funny, like the opening scene, but others are just way too far-out and/or gross, like the end. The ending is also dissapointing. But to the story overall, it's in a special area of films that fall between the good and the bad. It tries to be as good as spoof films like Austin Powers, or the first Scary Movie, but at least it's better then some spoofs like Not Another Teen Movie or Scary Movie (2 That is). Suprisingly, it has alot of cameos, mainly by African-American actors (Macy Grey's in it for a short short time, she only has one line (The film never supplies a reason why she has to be in the film)). But now bringing up the subject of the actors, the film takes a huge part at making Black jokes which can be funny for some actors (Regina Hall is hilarious once again in this film) but others, it just doesn't work. So, the fact of the matter is, don't waste your time in the theaters. Wait for if you want for DVD, but then, it's still not worth it. P.S. In the trailers a scene shows Eddie Griffen, Queen Latifah, and Anna Faris in a scene spoofing the original Matrix (Eddie: "I am Orpheous!"), but in the film, this scene, which seemed promising is no where to be found at all. Let's hope it'll be a deleated scene on the DVD. C+ -or- * * (Two Stars).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vast improvement over the first two.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me admit something before I start this review: I hated the first two Scary Movie films. To me, they took a wonderful concept of spoofing horror films, a huge goldmine of clichés and devices to mock, and diluted it with really low and pathetic sex jokes that had no place in the genre. So with the announcement of Scary Movie 3, I was the first to throw the idea of interest in the film and pursue more entertaining options, like watching paint dry. But as time went on I noticed big changes happening with the film such as the Wayans were fired and all of their ideas taken out, (which I feel was the reason for the wasted potential) and brought in David Zucker, a director with experience in great spoof films. Then came the PG-13 rating which was the hook that brought me in, to me it seemed like a guarantee that the sex jokes were gone.Let me say this: Scary Movie 3 is infinitely times better than the first two and I killed myself with laughter throughout the 90 minutes. The two scenes in particular were the janitor typing the teleprompter and the "alien videos", (yes, even I do laugh at some sex jokes, but not ones that involve gym teachers). I loved seeing actually actors who had experience in the genre take the center stage; Charlie Sheen &amp; Leslie Nielson were huge additions to the movie and their comic abilities shone throughout their performances. Leslie Nielson bumbled his way through a film, as he character was to do, and he succeeded well but I just wish there was more of him. There is plenty of slapstick humour, such as the boy who keeps getting hurt with sledgehammers and cars throughout the film in a cartoon-like fashion. I don't want to spoil most of the jokes in SM3 as part of the experience is laughing at them for the first time.There are still two flaws with SM3 that I felt will dog the series if Dimension Films decides to go with Scary Movie 4, (which I know they will). First is the pacing, now I know that Scary Movie isn't exactly a plot heavy movie but good pacing is still standard for any film and SM3 fails there. Basically all that happened was they moved from one "famous" scene to another, had their joke(s) happen then move onto the next one with no cohesion between them. The second is the milking of the series and unless they tap into the cheesy '80s horror films, (which is the goldmine I mentioned earlier) they are going to run out of good horror films to mock. The result is using Matrix and 8-Mile as spoof material, they're not spoofing them for being horror films but for being "popular" which contradicts the title "Scary Movie".Scary Movie 3 is the best of the series and the funniest comedy this year, but unless changes are made and flaws addressed we could see this series dig itself into a hole.7/10</fullReview>

Most shocking was the unlikely cameo of the `Power Twins,' former employees of Vince McMahon in the World Wrestling Federation. To make a long story short (too late) this movie was well done as compared to the last to rare and raw comedies that needed more work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pure garbage. Should be R rated, not PG-13. Has to be one of the worst movies I've ever paid to see. If this is the future of movies it's a sad time. I've seen many spoofs that were good movies, this is NOT one of them. Absolutely nothing entertaining about it, 12 year olds could put out a better movie.Someone was actually PAID to put this load of cr*p together...Don't waste your money or time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While it's better than the second film, it's not as successful with its jokes as the first. The first film was good because it spoofed the self-parody horror films of the late 90's, and it really was funny with all its jokes in toll. The third is funny as well but it misses a lot it its jokes more than it hits. Maybe its time to put an end to this franchise and focus on more funny fare, but with the currant state of horror movies now, I will not be surprise if Scary Movie 4 come out.

		<shortDescription>A Step-Down From Good Spoofs, A Step-Up From It's Prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3 tries to be original, but at times (which is most of the time) it isn't. The plot? Well it's not too hard to explain. In short: The Ring + Signs. It also tries to be bad while still being good (It tries to be "R" rated while being "PG-13"). Some scenes are sharp and funny, like the opening scene, but others are just way too far-out and/or gross, like the end. The ending is also dissapointing. But to the story overall, it's in a special area of films that fall between the good and the bad. It tries to be as good as spoof films like Austin Powers, or the first Scary Movie, but at least it's better then some spoofs like Not Another Teen Movie or Scary Movie (2 That is). Suprisingly, it has alot of cameos, mainly by African-American actors (Macy Grey's in it for a short short time, she only has one line (The film never supplies a reason why she has to be in the film)). But now bringing up the subject of the actors, the film takes a huge part at making Black jokes which can be funny for some actors (Regina Hall is hilarious once again in this film) but others, it just doesn't work. So, the fact of the matter is, don't waste your time in the theaters. Wait for if you want for DVD, but then, it's still not worth it. P.S. In the trailers a scene shows Eddie Griffen, Queen Latifah, and Anna Faris in a scene spoofing the original Matrix (Eddie: "I am Orpheous!"), but in the film, this scene, which seemed promising is no where to be found at all. Let's hope it'll be a deleated scene on the DVD. C+ -or- * * (Two Stars).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1. sex jokes- the dirtier does not mean the better. We've been shocked out that soft porn isn't shocking anymore. Its like a run on gag that's been way overused. to me its become like people who have run out of creativity, so lets use the same lame joke as close to porn as possible for a laugh. Well its not funny anymore. Especially when you have 10-13 year olds in the movie.2. That part also sucked. Kids that age have a problem shutting up for any kind of movie, but sit through the uncomfortably long sex jokes.3. The whole 8mile spoof was the worst written, most poorly acted and dragged out scene I've ever seen in my LIFE. it wasn't funny, it wasn't even mildly funny.4. The Ring spoof was too long. The actress was pretty bad. and its not bad in the "Its suppose to be bad" way, it was bad in the "I think she'd be bad even if she weren't trying" way. they should have added more spoofing on "Signs" Cause that's the time it was only funny. The matrix spoof was ok, but the scene in the commercial which wasn't in the film, was the funnier part.5. The michael jackson part, funnier in the commercial than it was in the movie.all in all, if you enjoy perverted sex humor you'll like this movie. If you're looking for a good laugh from a really funny movie go else where.the funniest part of the movie- you already saw in the commercial. So save yourself the 8.50 and wait for the commercial to come on tv for free. then you've seen the only parts you'll really laugh at.2/10. (2 only because the signs parody was kinda funny)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scary Movie for people who hate Scary Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate Scary Movie, I thought it was a complete crapfest from beginning to end and I didn't laugh once. The Wayans Brothers should NEVER EVER be let near a movie camera ever again. Live action gross out comedy isn't funny as all because anybody who wants to see films like that is all ready seen everything on shows like South Park. I didn't even need to see Scary Movie 2, because I figured the only thing I would want to see it for is the scenes with Andy Richter and James Woods.So when I heard Scary Movie 3 was coming out, I was angry. Then I heard the Wayans were off the project, I was interested. When I heard David Zucker was involved, the man who brought us REAL comedy like The Naked Gun, Hot Shots, and the underappriciated BASEketball, I was sold. Hearing that Kevin Smith was involved in the script writing was icing on the cake.So did I laugh at this movie. OH YEAH! A LOT! Was the rest of the audience I saw it with laughing a lot, they sure were! Will you laugh at this movie? Possibly, depends if you can laugh at slapstick, and silly humor. But if you need mindless bad jokes about bodily fluids and functions, than I don't think this is the film for you.But for me it's the most I've laughed in a theater for years. Thank you David Zucker for taking those damn Wayans to the woodshed and showing what good comedy is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe that the main reason why critics are faulting this movie is because of the lack of raunchy material!! What type of society are we in that we cannot enjoy a movie that does not promote sex, drugs, or obscene behaviors? That being said, this movie is by no means perfect. It lacks in a lot of areas, just as most parodies do. There seems to be a lack of cohesion to get all of the spoofing in and that takes away from the sense that you are watching a complete movie. I must admit that I do enjoy the comedy of Leslie Nielsen, so I was not disappointed in that respect. So, it was somewhat goofy, but I'll surely take that over some of the outrageously gross things I saw in the first two. Those movies would have been so much better without the unnecessary raunch, possibly the type of movies where a whole family could go and have a laugh, not one where you know that your parents or grandparents would be extremely offended. **1/2 stars as a movie, but I'll give it **** for changing the format back to a more family friendly viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally Someone Got the Scary Movie Franchise to work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first start out by saying I think Scary Movie 1 &amp; 2 are some of the worst movies I have ever seen. Now let me get to the good news Scary Movie 3 isn't as bad as the first 2. To be honest, Scary Movie 3 with a few scenes cut out could have possibly been one of the best spoofs to hit the cinema in years; however the editing doesn't happen.I for one was glad when the Wayans Brothers were off this project. I liked their work on In Living Color but they literally destroyed Scary Movie. The first movie had such a promising premise but they totally screwed it up. The second one was no different. The third one however has the spoof master David Zucker on board. David Zucker is responsible for some of my favorite comedies including Airplane, The Naked Gun Series, &amp; BASEketball. This movie is no way as good as any of those movies but it tries really hard to be funny. The movie's whole ring &amp; signs spoof was rather amusing and I did enjoy it. Some of the jokes in this film finally made me laugh because they went back to the normal spoof formula. However the spoof which I feel was way overused was the 8 mile spoof. First off this is a horror movie spoof so that shouldn't even be in the movie but its ok if it was in it for 5 minutes or so but the 8 mile part of the film took up a good 20 minutes or so of the film. This in my opinion made the movie seem to drag. I seen this movie with a theater packed full of people and it seemed that no one understood or laughed at the 8 mile portion of the film The movie had a decent cast including the funny Charlie Sheen, Anna Faris, &amp; several others. Also a great performance by Leslie Nielsen who still has what it takes to make funny movies. David Zucker uses a lot of jokes from my favorite comedies which are mentioned above. There is a classic Airplane line which is used at the end of the movie. Well all in all for David Zucker's first attempt at Scary Movie he did a decent job recovering from what the Wayans Brothers did to the franchise. In this rare case, I feel that the scary movie series will keep getting better over time as long as David Zucker stays on as director, however if he leaves as a director then this franchise should be put to a end. All in all Scary Movie 3 is a huge improvement over the first 2 and has a lot of jokes that work but still lacks something that would make this be a great spoof. I applaud David Zucker for coming on this film and trying to bring back spoof movies. My final rating for Scary Movie 3 is a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On Paper The movie was bad, but after watching it, it was hilarious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is nothing good about this movie except for the fact that it is funny. There are 2 problems people have that they need to overcome in order to enjoy this movie. Number one, the cinemetography and acting and whatnot can make a movie better, but if its funny anyway, you can only not like it so much. Direction isn't everything. And number 2, you need to realize that just because potty humour is potty humour it doesn't mean you can't think its funny. I know that its as funny to a 12 year old as it is to a 78 year old, just because you're trained to have culture doesn't mean that poo isn't culture.The statistics on imdb show that people under 18 and about 45-55 liked the movie (maybe because the 45-55 grew up with airplane) but either way, this movie was hilarious, and anyone looking for plot can go see lost in translation. If you're looking for a laugh, see Scary Movie 3.I payed 9.50 and it was worth every penny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If i have to say one one to describe this film, it would be this: HORRENDOUS! This film is without a doubt the most worst film ever to appear on DVD or anywhere. If i had my way, the creators of this crap would never have a job ever again and they would never be allow to go anywhere near a camera ever again. They shouldn't even be near a television or a computer. They're that messed up in the head.I know comedy pretty well. I know that jokes must have some inappropriate things or tasteless jokes a times, but i know the limit. If comedy was a dinner plate, the creators have poured every contents of salt and spices on the plate. In other words, they put too much that it's no longer good. If these creators have any decency, they would go back to school and get an education. I'll bet they never passed junior high school and their parents bribed their teachers to let them pass.This film has no comical effort, it just has old jokes that were so tedious and so tasteless that even tasteless humor looks clean. There's nothing in the film that indicated that the directors knew what they were doing, that includes the wayans brothers. The wayans brothers are like stupid little kids with no education. If they have any intellect, they would see that their films are stupid and hardly funny.The first film was OK, it made me laugh, but it was not recommended. The second one was really, really bad. I was sorely disappointed that anyone lets it come on to the screen and onto the DVD. Now this one proves that there is no limit to just how bad a film can be. They even decide to make films like this like "Epic movie" and such. Have humanity retreated back to the bronze age where they have no intellect? Have we just gone stupid and crazy? I feel that this is what's happening. Humanity is most certainly doomed to die by its own stupidity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First and foremost, I want you all to make your own opinion of the film. My views are not being forced upon any of you, and I expect you to respect my opinion of the film as I will respect yours. Don't take any of this personally as most of you should not be emotionally attached to the Scary Movie 3 project.I'm not going to compare the film to the previous two, because I like to look at sequels as "the next thing that happens," because that's exactly what it is. With that being said, the movie was not very entertaining. It relied entirely too much on physical gags instead clever written comedy, which is what parodies are all about. Someone who hasn't seen the movie (because I'm not paying to see it again) should take a ticker in and count how many times someone is hit with an inanimate object. I felt like I was watching the Three Stooges.The story was weak but the comedy was even weaker. I think I laughed six times during the entire run of the movie, and I am a die-hard comedy fan. It just wasn't funny or fun to watch for me. With a title like "Scary Movie," one would think that there would be more parodies of scary movies past and present. Instead the writers opted to parody Eminem's 8 Mile film for a good 35% of the movie in an almost identicle fashion to Malibu's Most Wanted. They could have been a little more clever with an 8 Mile parody if they were going to make it such a HUGE part of the movie.I hear they're planning a Scary Movie 4. If they keep the same writers, I think I'll pass.</fullReview>

BUT that one blowed!!! So i was having mixed feelings about this one, but when i heard it was david zucker directin( this guys knows funny) i thought, what the hey, no wayans bros, and david zucker? So I bought a late night ticket so that if the movie sucked i'd atleast get a good nap in. well... i must admit this was a hella funny movie. I mean seriously if it werent a public place i would be on the floor rolling around! It was a little predictable, there wasnt much of a plot and some of the stuff was just tongue in cheek humor but it was HILARIOUS! i mean i loved the Micheal Jackson bit! i mean i think he totally deserves to be made fun of! And the way this movie did it worked( you'll have to see it to get what i mean). Any way this is what a true spoof is supposed to be. Really Really stupid and plotless and yet really entertaining.

		<fullReview>There have been worse ones for sure. I liked Airplane and sequel. I went in expecting something pretty funny. The problems being that is was limited in what it could do being pg-13.Alot of the jokes were dated....Women Intitiuon or ESPN? Man, that is from when I was in Middle School. Making Fun of Micheal Jacksons child molester thing...Cmon. Alot of the jokes fell flat and even with the movie being as short as it was there seem to be too many underlying storylines. They couldn't seem to keep them all together.The end was kind of a jumbled mess. Don't get me wrong, there were funny parts and I did laugh out loud a few times. But overall it was a disapointment. Scary Movie 2 was not the best spoof but the opening scence was great in Scary Movie 2. I thought that was really funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Words cannot begin to describe how hilarious this movie was. I was a fan of both Scary Movie flicks, but this one blew them out of the water. Don't get me wrong, the Wayans' know humor and parody...but you just can't compare with the masters. I can't even begin to describe the greatness that David Zucker and Pat Proft brought to this film. I haven't laughed this hard at a movie since South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut.The funeral scene alone is worth the price of admission. Not to mention Leslie Nielsen doing what he does best. So many memorable scenes, so little time to list them all.Forget all of the bad things that you read. This movie is up there with The Naked Gun and Hot Shots flicks. I was practically raised on those movies and can pretty much quote them by memory. Scary Movie 3 reminded me of those flicks, and of how much Ilaughed when I saw them in the theater.Also, don't let the PG-13 rating fool you. It's quite vulgar and disgusting. I'm amazed they got away with a PG-13.All-in-all, a tremendous comedy that's really dumb but extremely entertaining. I'm definitely going to see this one again. It's definitely worth your time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.......rent Scary Movie 1.Seriously, this film was fairly above average for the gross-out spoof category. Leslie Nielson from the Naked Gun movies had an incredibly pointless role as the retard president. Faris looked insanely hot as always. It was really fun to see the dude from season 1 of What I like About You in a movie as well. Anthony Anderson was oftentimes hilarious in his reprisal of Mikhi Phiefer's role in 8-mile. The greatest weaknesses of the film are the Matrix and 8-Mile references. The 8-mile stuff was great for the trailer-gag but resulted in a huge lull in the comedy. Also, who even bothers to parody Matrix part 1 anymore? That movie does an excellent job of making fun of itself in the sequel. Overall, SM 3 is better than part 2 but a disappointment overall.

COME ON he's a great comedian and they cut like half of his screentime. He was in ONE FRICKEN SCENE. They should have just added every deleted scene. But overall, it was funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As I Hoped...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off as maybe many are, this was a disappointment of a movie. It wasn't as good as I was hoping for. I was pretty amped for this movie too. Now I did thorghoutly enjoy the first and second but this was a disaster. The only really plot came from The Ring, Signs, The Matrix, and 8 Mile. There weren't really any other spoofs in it but those four. Now it was funny so it's good if you want laughs but I think it being PG-13 made it not as good cause the other ones had that pervertedness to it and all the other good stuff. If you see it you'll get laughs but don't expect too much from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary Movie 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anna Faris returns as Cindy in the 3rd Scary Movie...&amp; it is a good thing she did...because her &amp; best friend "Brenda" have to carry this awful film! The obvious abcence of the Wayon's Family is so apparent as this "spoof" drags its way through many of the most talked about films of the year. Cindy makes many stops through (the dreadful) "Ring"...the rap disaster of "8 Mile" mocking a certain tierd rapper...onto the WAY OVERRATED "Signs." The only connection this one has to PART 1 &amp; PART 2 is Cindy &amp; Brenda just happen to be in "another spoof together." Nothing is mentioned of "Shorty, Ray, Tommy, or even the man with the 'funny hand' that PROMISED he would be back." Did they forget there was somewhat of a cliff hanger in SC2? Should I even waste time talking about the Michael Jackson inspired part...sure why not...that was the most ridiculous thing in the movie &amp; the most tasteless thing I've seen this year. (I could care less about the King Of Pop but that was just plain dumb.) Do not waste your money, for all you will find is writers trying to be something they're not &amp; trying to make reference to other races &amp; age groups that they are not affiliated with. BORING!

		<shortDescription>WAIT FOR VIDEO!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, Scary Movie 3 was very funny. In fact, some of the jokes had me laughing out loud (the fact that I can't remember which can't be a good thing, although that may be because it's 1:35am).That said, I found it a big waste of money. If I rented it, it would have been great. I might even buy it if I find it for under 10 bucks in a year or so. But paying $9.25 (times two people) to see a movie that was literally 75 minutes is not worth it at all (it says "Running Time: 90 minutes" but it lies, it started at 8:15 and by 9:35 I was in my car). Maybe I missed 10 minutes after the credits (like that oh-so-classic "Master of Disguise" ).Overall... it was a decent movie. Not as good as the original (haven't seen more than half of the 2nd yet). A lot of the parodies were hilarious (making fun of "Signs" with the line "Wait, they can fly spacecrafts here but they can't turn door handles" and the whole "a-truck-is-keeping-my-wife-played-by-Denise-Richards-alive" made my night), but some were just kind of weak (some of the "Ring" ones). And Simon Rex was really funny.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great! i've been waiting to see scary movie 3 ever since i heard about it almost 2 years ago i think. this was non-stop comedy! every 2 minutes the whole theater cracked up! i definately recommend this movie to spoof lovers and movie lovers! i think it was great from spoofing The Ring to Signs. David Zucker really saved the scary movie series with this one, after the 2nd one ruined it. the only problem is the scenes they cut out that was seen in the trailer, like the ones with Queen Latifah playing La'Quisha and teaching Cindy how to fight, spoofing the Matrix. Eddie Griffen had a really small role in the scene they show in theaters. but, the scene that they used was still hilarious, with the woman in the curse tape brushing her hair. Scary Movie 3 is definately worth it! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suggest you see this movie at an ungodly hour so as not to have the experience almost ruined by hoards (we're talking literally 200) of 13 year-olds who gasp, scream, and laugh at the top of the their little lungs because it's the first PG-13 movie they've seen without their parents, as I did. But the experience was not altogether ruined because I was with good company who appreciated the good jokes. It's interesting when you are in a crowd of 20 dozen middle-schoolers and they either don't laugh at the really good jokes or (!)erupt(!)into laughter when a character gets kicked in the groin.Don't run to see this movie, but if you do see it in the theater, wait a few weeks for the little kids to find a new fad. If you choose not to spend $9.00 on a 90min., non-stop, pleasure-fest for the clever side of you(if you have seen all the movies they spoof it only makes it ten times funnier) then this is a definite rental. Too many cameos to mention, but George Carlin's is perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first two...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3 is a far cry from those brilliant parodies like Airplane or Naked Gun yet it's still much funnier than the first two movies. A lot of people were griping over the PG-13 rating but this really doesn't hurt the film. For the first two, whenever the Wayans brothers reached a creative block, they were like "Well, we'll just blast Cindy with a bodily fluid" and that's where the R rating came from. In SM3, Zucker moves the script along rather quickly, getting rid of the need for any gratuitous bodily fluid shots.The first half of this film was excellent, when it was parodying The Ring and Signs separately. It was bogged down by the parody of 8 Mile (a useless scene created simply for the writer to try and make ghetto black people funny to the audience), but for the most part, contained good jokes and (for the first time ever in the series) minor character development.However, once the second half of the film begins and all the storylines begin to merge, the story loses its focus. It tries too desperately to make the stories coincide while, at the same time, keep the humor. There are only one or two good jokes in this half (the footage of the aliens will have you cracking up). Soon, the film is filled with too many undeveloped jokes and useless characters (Macy Gray, anyone?) and all interest is lost. However, the second half of the film actually contains a moment that is, ironically, scary. Go figure.The talent in this film is, for the most part, pretty good. Charlie Sheen, Anna Faris and Regina Hall turn in the best performances in the film (Regina Hall, as with the first two movies, steals every scene she's in). Some excellent comedic talent is found in Leslie Nielsen and Eddie Griffin; however, it is vastly underused and their being in the film feels like a waste. The only complaint with the cast would have to be Ja Rule, who plays the President's personal Secret Service escort, and whoever the anemic-looking kid playing Cindy's nephew. These performances were just awful. This is like "nuclear war" awful.So, yeah, if you want a few good laughs, go see a matinee of this one. It's not worth full price and (considering how much of the trailer didn't make it into the movie) you might want to wait for the DVD instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has its moments, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All in all this was a very disappointing film (as if the Scary Movie series had high standards to begin with). The plot of this third installment of the series parodies primarely "The Ring" and "Signs", but it also spoofs several other hit films from the last couple years. In fact, the film seems to focus too much on the spoofs and not enough on a stable plotline.Right off the bat SM3 feels like a different comedy from its preceders. The jokes focused less on sex, drugs, and gross-outs, and more on slapstick comedy, sight gags, and easter eggs. There were quite a few great laughs it got out of me, but the rest of the jokes got only a smirk or a few chuckles at best. There are countless celebrity cameo's here, some of which add to the laughs, but many of them seem almost completely pointless.The movie overall isn't completely terrible, and by all means go check it out if you're curious. But don't expect to walk out of the theatre satisfied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I love the first 2 Scary Movie's (I know the second one wasn't that great but Chris Elliot made up for it with his brilliant deformed hand), so I was a little disappointed to hear that the Wayans brothers had nothing to do with this one. But Zucker definitely has made his share of good parody movies (Airplane!, The Naked Gun, Hot Shots) so I figured it would still be funny despite its PG-13 rating..and for the most part it was. First of all, I will see ANYTHING with Anna Faris in it from now on. Second, seeing Samara Morgan get her ass kicked is well worth the ticket price alone. There were some really funny scenes in this movie (the pooping horse scene was one of the funniest things ever), and there were some very boring scenes also (the only thing worse than the 8 Mile parody in SM3 was the movie 8 Mile). Call me a sicko if you want, but I kind of missed the raunchy R-rated humor that the Wayans' had in their movies (and Shorty was very much missed, son). But Scary Movie 3 is pretty dang funny, Anna Faris is amazingly hot, and so I say it's worth seeing (providing that you've seen The Ring and Signs, otherwise you won't get anything).

		<fullReview>I really liked the first movie, the second while lacking is in my opinion better than its reputation and I disliked the fourth one. The third instalment to the series is neither a great or a bad movie, just somewhere in between as well as being quite a fun movie. The script does have its funny moments but it isn't as fast-paced, witty or as laugh-a-minute as the first two, the story is thin and on the predictable side and the film isn't as efficiently directed and is uneven in pace being rushed one minute and a little too slow the next. The cast though give it their all, Anna Farris gives her best performance of the series, and Charlie Sheen and Leslie Nielson are a lot of fun. There are some genuinely funny spoofs my favourites being The Ring and 8 Mile ones too, the production values are much more than cheap cheap to video fodder and the soundtrack is great. All in all, not great but I liked it. 6/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though made for the time, the laughs still come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>News-reporter Cindy (Farris) attempts to investigate the mysterious appearance of crop circles whilst a deadly videotape circulates around the community.The first scary movie in 2000 brought some comic laughs to our screens as it articulately depicted the brute nature of Wes Craven horror Scream. The spoof won comedy fans over and has since seen spin off sequels and numerous other parody franchises such as Disaster Movie and Epic Movie.Here the third instalment of the franchise aims its attention towards Signs, The Ring and 8 Mile with some great gags and physical humour to boot, if not as strong as the original parodies in Scary Movie.The 2000 release was so popular because it basically was Scream, only with a lighter and more comic approach whereas here the parodies are all there but which never quite feel as genuine as the original movies.The 8 mile reflections for example are way over the top as Simon Rex brings an over exaggerated Eminem replica to the film. His exuberant timing and constant flaws will generate laughs but he never appears as the famous rapper which was present in the Marshal Mathers film. To be fair to Rex the scripting for his part was inconsistent as the over dramatic concepts overshadowed the comic abilities.Queen Latifha's Oracle is unbelievably annoying and flat, though her 'husband' Orpheus has a few good moments. I say a few as he is only on screen briefly.Anna Faris again brings her charm to the screen and is once more the best on screen presence. Charlie Sheen also generates a sophisticated sense of humour to spice up the dull parts. His on screen part with Denise Richards with the car crash is particular comedy gold.When it comes to replicating hits, Scary Movie 3 has numerous digs with its sweeping physical humour. Though predictable it doesn't quite take the shine off how funny it is. The inclusion of Cody and the car is among the best bits.Where The Matrix Reloaded gets a fine comedy work over, The Ring and Signs perhaps are a bit overstretched for that sheer comedy originality. But on first viewing they are quite hilarious and you will still be laughing later on.These films are designed for short term profit and to poke fun at current blockbusters and celebrities so it may tire after a few years, but this is still comedy with a sly edge</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie before I watched The Naked Gun series and Airplane! But as I walked out of those two movies, I thought to myself, wow, these movies share the same sense of humor as Scary Movie 3. And they do. This movie is ABSOLUTELY hilarious. If you're looking for some of the greatest slapstick comedy in film history and some drop dead funny cameos, you've come to the right place. This is a perfect example of an entirely underrated comedy. The references to all of the movies to which it concerns are spot on, I especially liked the Matrix ones, in which Queen Latifah and George Carlin are so great, and so quotable. So, if you're into David Zucker's other movies, you'll love this one to death, just as I do. And remember, if you're some skeptic watching this movie thinking it'll be horrible, it wont be NEARLY as fun as watching it with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this in theaters, and man was I doubled over with laughter. Nearly everybody in the packed theater was laughing, and it was hard to hear the next lines. Up to this day, it is still just as funny.Zucker, Mazin, and Proft prove to pull off a clever and witty spoof with the PG-13 rating. However, this was one of the pinpoints in the first 2, the dirty humor. But the Zucker spin on it was just as effective. It's just one of those movies with screwball characters, and honestly, Simon Rex is perfect for his role. He's always screwing things up, and acting like an idiot. Great casting here.All in all, this is a movie to sit back with your buddies and start laughing, because it's one of the strongest in the Scary Movie series. The order IMO goes as follows: 1, 3, 2, 4. Even though 4 is my least favorite, I still enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scary Movie 3" is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. It is so much funnier than the other two and the gags are better. Of course this film isn't great by any means, but it still really funny. From Charlie Sheen waking up in bed and hitting his head on the lamp, not once, but twice, to the little Ring girl coming out of the TV and leaning over to get the water out of her ears. The humor was much better written in this film too. The jokes were funnier and the actors were funnier. I like the first two Scary Movies, but this one just has all the better jokes. Jeremy Piven was great in a couple of scenes as news anchor Ross Giggins. I thought it was so funny when Cindy, her boss, and the black janitor were fighting over the teleprompter and Ross was reading everything that was on it. And the black janitor wrote "I've been hitting it with Giggins' woman for ten years. She likes her some chocolate" and Ross is just reading away, not even realizing what he said. I thought that was one of the funniest scenes in the movie. Charlie Sheen was great as the farmer Tom. I normally don't consider him funny but he was perfectly cast in this film. Besides Anna Faris as Cindy, of course, I thought the character of George was the funniest character in this film. I mean, what's funnier than a redneck white guy trying to be a black rapper? It's so funny because he doesn't realize just how bad he really is. I laughed till I had tears in my eyes. "Scary Movie 3" isn't a great film by any means but it's definitely the funniest out of all the Scary Movie films. I think this one is even better than #4. The jokes and humor just work in this film. Sure this film won't win any awards but it will definitely put a smile on your face, especially if you're a fan of slapstick humor, like I am. Thank you for reading my review!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My 10/10 rating assumes that you decided that you like "Scary Movie 3" before you saw it. And it doesn't disappoint. Spoofing "Signs", "The Ring" and "8 Mile" (among other things), it's another gag-a-minute comedy from the director of "Airplane!". But how could it not be, starring Leslie Nielsen? I think that my favorite scene was either the part with Simon Cowell, or the news room scene (I'd like to try that someday).In conclusion, just remember that "SM3" is a joke. Anna Faris reprises her role as Cindy Campbell (so she has these movies to her resume, as well as "Brokeback Mountain"). The rest of the cast includes Charlie Sheen as the farmer discovering crop circles, and various people have small roles. Remember, all completely silly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is another spoof movie from the franchise Scary Movie. This film is about Cindy who has to investigate mysterious crop circles and video tapes, and help the President in preventing an alien invasion.This is the best of the three films. David Zucker lowers the perverted jokes and adds more intelligent and physical humor into the franchise. The acting are meant to be bad. The only thing this film tries to succeed is to make people laugh. They accomplish their goal right away as the start of the film progress. Too bad Jim Abrahams isn't with the Zuckers, this time.This film is rated PG-13 for the first time. It's also kinda scary in parts where it has some pop-up moments that makes you jump. The great things about the Scary Movies is that what films you're scared of, they make something look funny and changes it to something scary. This is a hilarious movie and you'll remember some lines.I highly recommend this film to those who wants to see this sequel. Younger teens can actually watch it for the first time. This is sure to be a comedy hit!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Scary Movie 3' is the third installment in this wildly raunchy, comedy-horror-spoof franchise. This time around we have a new director, David Zucker, who was involved in the 'Airplane' movies, which I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing. Nothing against the Wayans' brothers because I think that they're great, but this Zucker guy finally got it right. He effectively combined the plots of 'The Ring' and 'Signs', and the entire movie definitely kept me entertained from start to finish. It's raunchy and offensive, but that stuff is actually funny this time. Not some stupid scene with a guy screwing a zombie-chick with a bag over her head. That was getting old. The only thing I was disappointed in from this sequel was the lack of the character Brenda(Regina Hall). She's only in a couple of scenes, and over the previous two films I have come to enjoy her character's sassy attitude(the theater scene in the original is one of the funniest scenes EVER). But oh well. From the looks of it she is going to come back for the fourth installment, along with Anna Faris. Cool. This series could go on into the double-digits, given that there is always some silly horror movie to make fun of.8/10 is my vote. The best so far in the 'Scary Movie' franchise.</fullReview>

The opening scene with Pam Anderson and Jenny McCarthy was good also. Many of the jokes fell flat, but it is humorous just to see Charlie Sheen in movies like this. The plot resembles a cross between the Ring and Signs. Of course, it makes no sense, but it doesn't need to. It was also kind of funny the parts where they are showing the aliens on the news. They set it up like in Signs, but in this the aliens are hanging out, drinking with people like the people don't even notice them.FINAL VERDICT: You know it is very silly and has stupid jokes.

It's fresher, funnier and the movies it makes fun of actually were movies that I saw and had a certain feeling about (whether I liked them or not). It's main goals are Signs (which I loved) and Ringu (which was pretty good as well). But numerous other movies are mentioned (to name a few: 8 Mile, The Sixth Sense).While it starts out like a blast, the movie loses a lot of it's touch in the second half, coincidentally (?) when Leslie Nielsen makes his appearance.

Besides these two films, topsy turvy bits from THE OTHERS, 8 MILE and MATRIX RELOADED are thrown in for good measure, and the highlight of those segments has to be Queen Latifah in an outrageous take on the Oracle.

This one is a lot better than most other spoof movies I've seen, and unlike the first two scary movies, actually has a plot, instead of just being an hour and a half full of gags. That's not to say that there are no gags, there are plenty, and most of them are hilarious. A few of the jokes fall flat, but most of them are great. The plot is a mix of some popular newer movies, including; 8 Mile, The Ring, The Others, Signs, etc. The characters are also taken from those movies, which allows for some good spoofing of several of the movies as well as characters. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys spoof movies and has seen at least one of the films it parodies. All in all, it couldn't have done a much better job spoofing those films while bringing the plot forward. There are just a little too many jokes that fall flat or let down the audience. Not the greatest spoof movie, but up there with the best. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film to round off the pub crawl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Round three of gratuitous bad-taste spoof comedy has unlikely characters chasing crop circles, alien invaders, and people dying mysteriously seven days after watching a weird video. It includes several silicone-enhanced women, a white rapper, and other caricatures of actors or characters from other movies (as well as several that just play themselves). The IMDb website lists 23 movies (horror, sci-fi and other) that receive the send up treatment so, if you see enough mainstream movies, half the fun is seeing how many references you can spot. My own list included two that weren't in the IMDb list - Dark Water and Something About Mary ? but there were enough I didn't spot to make it party fun for watching again later with such friends who can share these otherwise mindless gutter offerings. Riotously politically incorrect or just dumb ? depending on how low you let your taste in comedy sink. Quite honestly it's not a very good movie, but if you liked stuff like Scream 2, I Know What You Did Last Summer, or South Park, you might well enjoy this as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The spoof genre strikes another hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsWe open with a parody of a key scene in The Ring with Jenny McCarthy and (looking her age) Pamela Anderson sending up the two ill-fated school girls who talk about the tape.We then move on to a plot involving Cindy (Anna Faris) from the first two films,who's now grown up and is a TV reporter,going on the trail of the tape with the aid of her vacuous galpal Tabitha (Marni Eng).There's also a sub-plot involving a potential alien invasion discovered by Father Tom (Charlie Sheen) a parody of Mel Gibson's character in the film Signs,and that's not to mention his younger brother George (Simon Rex) who has aspirations to become a successful white rapper in a parody of Eminem in 8 Mile,but his nitwit limitations seem to hinder him from doing so.Never mind,though,'cos 'the hood's always got his back.'With these two huge threats hanging in the balance,which will ultimately emerge as the real danger?A prequel was weirdly unexpected,but believably unsurprising,as,despite the predominantly poor reviews,the first sequel was quite a money earner.In the leading role,we have Sheen,who previously carried the two Hot Shots films in the early 90s and so has experience in handling the spoof genre and fares much the same here.And,at last,the series has recognised the value of spoof master Leslie Nielsen,finding him a convienient role as the president seeking desperately to avert the potential impending invasion and in the process helping proceedings no end.As for the film itself,it gets off to a rather dull first-half,with jokes you've either seen already or are rather too predictable and see-through to have much of a lasting impact.But if you just stick it out long enough,the film gradually builds in hilarity,tossing in,for good measure,pot shots at The Others,The Lord of the Rings and an especially funny one of The Matrix.***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuinely dumb, yet funny movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was sending up some of my favourite movies, Signs, The Sixth Sense, etc, and yet I couldn't help but laugh at some of the genuinely funny spoofs. My personal favourite was the part where Charlie Sheen's character says something like "the dog's are acting strangely", and a dog goes past driving a tractor, etc. Yes, it's Airplane/ Flying High humor, it's stupid, it's obvious at times very ridiculous, but if you enjoy these kind of movies, and you get all the in-jokes, then you will really like this film.I really didn't expect too much -when you put a 3 on the end of a film's title it's always a worry. (Yet, we have Lord of the Rings part 3, which is fantastic and American Wedding, so maybe I lied!)This movie is less sexually oriented than the first, but it has plenty of low-brow humor in it still, and it's well worth watching.Perhaps wait for it on DVD, as it isn't very long and if you're going to pay $10 to see a movie, you should at least see Cold Mountain or The Last Samurai where you'll get value for your $1!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this "movie" at the local cinema and I have a question. It may have been the copy I saw, or maybe the theater didn't have the film set up right on the projector, but for some reason, I kept seeing the boom stick appear in every other scene in the movie! Was this deliberate of the filmmakers or did they really not know that the boom stick was in most of the shots? Not that it took away from the movie. This was a comedy, and it had laughs. It's just that boom stick was a reminder that what you were watching was not at all taken seriously. Hence, Scary Movie 3 is a joke of a movie, and a funny one at that.</fullReview>

I have now seen it twice and it has become my favorite movie in the series. This is one of the best screw ball comedies that I have seen. It has funny jokes, great one liners, funny characters and many movies combined in a funny way to make a crazy "plot". The only fault I can think of is that they maybe used too many slapstick jokes. I hope the next movie will be even better if that's possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Moose Hole - Review of Scary Movie 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boo! Did that scare you? Maybe the large amount of horror releases this year did. It is just amazing how quickly the American public can go from a period after September 11th when all slasher flicks were deemed insensitive to the present day when two R-rated blood fests are tops at the weekend box office. It's also amazing to see how quickly the spoof film could go from being a hot commodity to just plain leftovers. Though the genre was invented long before the original Scary Movie, this horror spoof regenerated the failing genre when it grossed $157 million by the end of its run in 2000. A year later Scary Movie 2 opened to a less then stellar $71 million end but enough money was made to deem it a success and green light another sequel. But now the third film in the series may be the bottom of the barrel as it has had a difficult road to completion with the creators of the franchise dropping out and several false production starts. Will Scary Movie 3 fail at the box office? Not likely with the low production budget, effective marketing campaign, and enough product placement to cover any a bit of those costs. Then why is this considering the low end of the stick? You have to admit that the story or lack there of can't get worse.The story ?. Well, there really isn't one except for the fact that it spoofs films like The Matrix Reloaded, The Ring, The Others, and Signs. But besides that fact, there is some small plot trying to squeak through. Cindy Campbell, now fresh from college, gets her first big break as a TV news reporter when strange crops circles appear in the corn fields of farmer Tom Logan. In her investigation, she also discovers a videotape that kills its viewers seven days after they watch it and her nephew is one of them. Cindy is now called up by the president to help prevent an alien invasion and stop of the deaths cause by the mysterious tape. The story for Scary Movie 3, like it was said before, really doesn't exist but when is this never case with any spoof film? Bottom-line is that the third installment in the horror-spoof franchise is less consistent with its weak plot then the other two films but it comes to these films, you just have to leave your head at the door. For some movie-goers, that can be easier said then done.There are plenty of prominent performers in this cast but most of them are mere cameos then featured roles. Anna Faris once again appears as Cindy Campbell in the spoof franchise. She obviously has the comedic talent for these types of films but if she doesn't get out of things sooner or later, she'll be stuck in these roles for the rest of her career. That would be quite unfortunate because Faris clearly has the talent to branch out into other genres. Charlie Sheen and Denise Richards appear, if not briefly, together in the film but it is Sheen who gets the bigger role. The biggest laughs of the film came from him especially his battle with Michael Jackson (or at least, a decent look-alike). The biggest disappointments came from Queen Latifah and Eddie Griffin, who play the Oracle and Orpheus. It wasn't their performances but their lack of appearance in the film that left many unsatisfied. The two are promoted pretty decently in the trailers and television ads yet they appear less then ten minutes in the entire film. Miramax should ashamed! The opening sequence featuring Pamela Anderson and Jennie McCarthy is just pathetic and borders on the line of stupid funny and just plain stupid. There are many blondes in the world that resent the `dumb blonde' comments ?. They must be on the verge of killing these two. Not one bit of their sequence is funny and showcases they can't act even in a spoof feature that doesn't require much acting in the first place.Overall, Scary Movie 3 scares the movie-going audience for all the wrong reasons. Will there ever be an intelligent spoof film or is that just another pipe dream? Not to say that the film is not funny, it is a large improvement from the last Scary Movie feature, but there has to be a better way to get laughs then relentless slap-stick that gets more annoying then some of the films it tries to spoof. The running over of the kid got repetitive quickly and many of the sequences featuring it could have been ditched. One scene that got a little too provocative featured Darrell Hammond as a priest who baby-sits Cindy Campbell's nephew. Though there are many out there who are not Catholic, there are plenty who will find the sequence insensitive and mean-spirited. In fact, the entire feature is mean-spirited but manages to crack off a few decent laughable moments to make the film all the less tolerable. If you want intelligent filmmaking, effective humor, a stellar cast, a believable story, and a memorable time at the movies then this is not your film by a long shot. Scary Movie 3 requires nothing of the audience but to leave their heads at the door much like the filmmakers themselves.My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intermittently funny parody centers around Cindy Campbell, now a reporter, as she's sent to investigate a cryptic videotape that kills its viewers seven days later. In addition, mysterious crop circles begin to appear and the incompetent U.S. President tries to prepare the world for what could be a deadly alien invasion. A definite improvement over Scary Movie 2 the film is still wildly uneven, but the cast is likable and the filmmakers do a good job of making the transition from crude toilet humor to lightweight, good-natured parody. Not particularly memorable, but less racy and off-putting than its predecessor so you can sit through it at least once. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*Anna Faris is back and she's blond. So far, so good. This "Scary Movie' outing focuses on spoofing "The Ring" and "Signs". Faris sees the ring and notices the signs. If you haven't seen those two movies, you probably won't get half the jokes. Leslie Nielsen pops in as the president and Charlie Sheen does a stoic Mel Gibson. There are other riffs on "The Matrix" and "8 Mile".The "Scary Movie" franchise is turning into an annual event celebrating the previous year in film. If a movie struck any kind of nerve with audiences, (preferably younger audiences), the "Scary Movie" people want to send it up immediately. What films will make it into next year's (inevitable) "Scary Movie"? I see Anna Faris in a skin tight leather outfit, ala "Underworld", running from a guy with a chainsaw while Freddy and Jason duke it out.As far as this year's "Scary Movie" sequel, it was alright. OK. Fair. Decent. 5/10. The "8 Mile" segment was the best. That had me going. "Scary Movie 3" starts off hilarious, "The dogs are acting strange.", but then proceeds to miss, miss and miss again. This movie was made in a rush and it shows. By the midway mark, it was running out of gas and wheezing to the finish line.But it's got some funny bits. It's worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complete failure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me start out my saying that I laughed probably 3 times throughout the entire film. I went with some friends wanting to see THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE but when we couldn't get in honestly and were denied to be let in, we had to see SCARY MOVIE 3. Let me say: it was horrid.Most of the jokes fell flat on their faces. About four of the jokes worked and there was too much of a story. The original SCARY MOVIE followed the plot of SCREAM but strayed away from a lot of the subplots and sort of made up its own story as it went along. This film did that also. But it was very unsuccessful. Spoofs of SIGNS, THE RING, and 8 MILE are the main focuses of this terrible atrocity.The Wayans Brothers ran out of gags to keep the series going. That is how the IMDb reporter put it. And he was right. I was hoping that David Zucker would be able to save this third installment, but sadly he lost it. The fact that this film was the only PG-13 one in the series, just makes it worse. The opening sequence with Jenny McCarthy and Pamela Anderson is a complete tease. The story moved along decently enough, but it was far too hokey for my tastes. However, there was some fat gay guy and his lover (both wearing leather jackets) sitting two seats down from me that were laughing their asses off. This was probably part of the reason I loathed this film so much because they were continually talking about what they were going to do to each other as soon as they got home. That, and the fact that they wouldn't move down a seat so another couple could fit in on our row. Anyway, the movie sucked. If you do choose to see it (which I don't recommend) wait for the video. SCARY MOVIE 3: 2/5.You'll be tempted to leave early.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of All Scary Movies. I Loved It Very Much !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was eager to watch this movie when I saw it previews, but I had few doubts. The previous Scary movies were good but were cheap at heart for giving stupid jesters with adult matters. I got irritated while watching it in front of my family. But when it came to 3rd chapter, it's a whole different story.Scary Movie 3 (Spoilers******) Based on the characters created by Wayans brothers the Scary Movie series takes a new turn when it took up by the acclaimed director of the cult comedies, David Zucker. Like his previous works he gives a respected look to the rude comedy by transforming the sexual offensive teenage movie into a family enjoyable humor. That makes this movie the best one in the Scary franchise.Teenage Cindy (innocent Anna Faris) is now grown up, she is working as a news reporter in a TV channel. Not satisfied about her current status she wanted to do some important stories like strange crop circles recently appeared on a farmer's corn field. Even taking care of her best friend's child, Cindy is not seeking for any relationship. But things are going to be peppy when she meets up with a young rapper George (onscreen portrayal wise a carbon clone of Eminem, Simon Rex).Anna Faris rocked as mature Cindy but the real star in the movie was David Zucker, he marked his signature again, it's pretty funny to watch such unrelated silly things on background when the story goes. With a dream cast of top celebrities including Pamela Anderson, Charlie Sheen, Anthony Anderson, Simon Cowell, Fat Joe, Queen Latifah, Ja Rule and DENISE RICHARDS, Zucker created another Naked Gun movie! I always loved his works.And last but not least, How can be David Zucker movie without the Superman Leslie Nielsen! I was missed SUPERSTAR Leslie Nielsen for a long time and he just came back in his younger days by this movie. Nielsen rocked as American President.It's good the Wayans brothers didn't take part in the movie, if that happened it should have Sucked. Due to their absence and the presence of master of spoof cinema David Zucker, Scary Movie 3 is the best hilarious movie to DATE! Best wishes for his upcoming 4th Scary Movie!"I give this movie 10 out of 10!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the third installment of the Scary Movie-series the directors-chair is turned over to comedy-veteran David Zucker. Something that feels sensible considering how lousy the second movie truly was.Here the target of the spoofs are mostly Shyamalans "Signs" and the American version of "The Ring", but also other movies like "The Matrix" get their share. What becomes apparent right from the start is how much better the comedy works here than in Scary Movie 2. It's still no amazing comedy or masterpiece. But it's not a complete failure like the second movie. It seems David Zucker has a stronger feeling for what works on screen. Also the actors help. Charlie Sheen still has that special comic timing that made the Hot Shots-movies so good, and Simon Rex is pretty funny too. Especially in his "8 Mile"-scenes.In short you should probably not watch this is if you feel that serious cinema or pretentious comedy is your calling. But if you enjoyed movies like "The Naked Gun", "Hot Shots" and other similar outings it's quite possible that you will find this at least decent entertainment. I rate it 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3 was a pretty good movie. It was nice to see characters from the first two Scary Movies in this movie. I love what the plot was based on (other actual movies). The jokes were hilarious and the actors made it.I believe that Simon Rex who played as Geaorge made the movie. He was the main character that connected the other characters together. Anna Faris was also good. Her character is so silly but funny. Regina Hall as Brenda was hilarious, you would just laugh by her saying something a certain way. Everyone else was good, but these characters caught my attention.In conclusion, I loved this movie. I like the actors and plot. The satires about the different movies were so funny.

		<fullReview>SPOILERSThe spoofing of film has been big business for a long time now. Whilst never substantially meritable, the films have always been good in that they've possessed the occasional decent joke. In "Scary Movie 3", this ongoing series of horror spoofing is joined by director David Zucker and Leslie Nielson. Zucker and Nielson have worked together many times, both on the "Naked Gun" series (the first two films in 1988 and 1991) and on "Airplane" (1980), and by joining the crew of this slowly failing series, they have injected a brief breath of fresh air into it.In the third film of the series, Anna Faris stars once more as Cindy Campbell. Switching her attention this time to films like "The Ring" (2002) and "Signs" (2002), Faris' character teams up with farmers Tom and George (Charlie Sheen and Simon Rex) to battle aliens and a demented little girl.Perhaps the biggest problem with the "Scary Movie" series is that they have a mild tendency to inspire guilt. Wanting to feel relatively mature, the viewer watches these films and wants to feel repulsed and frustrated. Ultimately however, by mixing Faris' comic timing to the occasional cracking joke, it's impossible not to laugh. Like so many spoof films, we watch this series of horror jokes and we laugh at things which shouldn't really be funny, but end up being hilarious. In this third outing for example, one poor little boy spends the vast majority of the film being accidentally hit by different objects. Whilst this joke does slowly get tired and repetitive, for perhaps far too long, the boy's suffering is worryingly funny.Spoof films in general are good to watch because all too often they just humiliate films we might have watched at the cinema and remember well. On a personal note, "Signs" was a huge disappointment, and in "Scary Movie 3", the constant joking at the expense of the Mel Gibson film is wonderful. This almost in-joke style ridiculing is in itself a problem though in that you can only fully appreciate a joke if you've seen the original which the film is ridiculing. For example there is little point watching a joke aimed at the "Matrix" trilogy if you've never seen them or heard much about them. As a result, spoofs find themselves forced to limit themselves to ridiculing mainstream films rather than fitting in the occasional joke about some small, easily targeted film.All in all, "Scary Movie 3" is better off for the absence of the Wayans brothers. Whilst originally responsible for the characters and the series, these two men directed a stale second installment and became too repetitive. By keeping only two members from previous stories, this third film allowed itself to explore new ground. It's still by no means the best spoof ever, but "Scary Movie 3" really does have some cracking jokes in it. Like the rest of the series, this film is a guilty pleasure which we can watch for a laugh, but can never EVER take seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly fun with just enough hits to make it worth seeing and a refreshing drop in crudity from the other movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cindy Campbell is a reporter for a local television news network. Tired of endless stories about topless women, violence, sex and weather, Cindy starts to investigate the urban legend of a videotape where, one week after watching it, the viewer dies a horrible death. When her friend tells her that she has watched the tape, Cindy steps up her investigation and starts to wonder if it could be linked to the strange events at a local farm where farmers Tom and George have woken to find crop circles around their fields.I have seen the first Scary Movie and was a little bit put off by how very crude it was and yet also how unfunny large stretches of it and, as a result, I never bothered with the second movie. With the Wayans brothers off this one and the additions of David Zucker in combination with a few actors who had been good in other spoofs I decided to give this film a go (albeit in on video!). After a failed attempt at a sexy and funny spoof on Ringu (very sexy women but it totally misses) the film settled down into a style of humour that mixed silly spoof stuff with movie spoofs galore (even if they didn't all fit). The plot works hard to shoehorn the basic plots of Signs and Ringu into the same story, adding a white rapper subplot along the way but if you have come for the story then you will likely be annoyed by it ? I, however, had come for the laughs.The humour leaves the crudity of the original movie and uses more standard spoof stuff of silly lines and silly jokes (you know ? where the other character gives the speaker a slow double take) which works better as it feels lighter. The movie spoofs are pretty good and the film manages to have just enough hits to make it worth seeing. Plenty of stuff misses or is too obvious (some of the movie spoofs are too obvious or have been done better elsewhere, vis-a-vie, the architect bit at the mtv awards) but I laughed out loud about 15 times which, hardly the stuff of Airplane is still good enough for this type of film.The cast has some returns and are mostly good. Although not as good as he was in Hot Shots, Sheen is pretty good at playing it straight and does well.Better still is Simon Rex (I've never heard of him) who had a real good comic touch for the material and was very funny. It all helps that they are joined by the master of this sort of stuff in Nielsen. He only has a few scenes late in the movie but he is as good as ever (even if his material isn't) and, although not as funny here, it was a nice touch to have him replay his 'we're all counting on you' gag from Airplane. The rest of the cast are not as good and they err on the side of lazy mugging rather than good spoof delivery. Faris may be good looking but she is a reactor and screamer at best; Piven is funny but is no more than a cameo but the main trio of Nielsen, Sheen and Rex had most of the laughs for me.I know this is a silly comedy but one aspect of the casting and joking worried me and that was the way that the black characters all seemed to basically fit into the model of cool but angry and able to 'throw down' at a moments notice. While the white people got a kicking as well (albeit with a series of 'you can't dance' etc type jokes that were just boring) the way that the black characters were ingrained in this image was a little off putting. Off course I wasn't overly concerned with this until I saw how many celebrities were queuing up to hammer home the ethnic stereotype: Latifah does yet another role where she shouts racial abuse at a white woman and then beats her up (sadly both for comic effect), Hall does the same and is very clichéd with her 'hmm-mm's', 'giiiiiirl' and neck bending. However, more annoying than these general stereotypes was the connection between blacks and gun crime ? the rap battle starts with a request to turn on safety catches like a theatre audience would be asked to turn off their phone and a host of rappers turn up just to get into a petty squabble and blast each other. I know that this is the personae that they must present but I would have hoped that people Rza, Method Man, Redman and Macy Gray would have more pride than to underdo their positive leads (in some areas) with something like this ? although I expect nothing better from the self-promoter who is Master P! I'm not a big Fat Joe fan (poor man's Big Pun) but kudos to him for just letting his talent do the work rather than being made a cheap ethnic joke.Sorry to labour that point and I am starting to accept that this is the public image that parts of the black community are happy to have in their films and maybe I am making a big deal out of it (Bringing Down The house was a number 1 hit in the US while I was really offended by its racism at all sides). Despite this minor aspect that bothered me I did enjoy the film enough to be glad I watched it. It may have nearly as many misses as good hits but the hits are strong enough to keep me laughing ? not consistently like the great spoofs but often enough to stop me losing interest. The plot is a mess and the cameos clutter the good work by Nielsen, Sheen and Rex but generally the humour is an enjoyable mix of silly lines and double takes with good (if uninspired) movie spoofs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parody of some latest flicks, quite funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you rent films like 'Scary movie' you should know what to expect - comedy of situations, continuous series of gags, under-the belt humor, and in this case a lot of quotes from other films. 'Scary Movie 3' is mostly a parody, making fun of some of the big screen movies that were successful in the last few years. It works quite well - I have seem most if not all the movies quoted by SC3, and enjoyed many of the gags. Unfortunately, there is no hysterical laugh, but there are a lot of good jokes and funny ideas - like casting Leslie Nielsen as the ultimate US president. Anna Farris is good looking and has real comedy skills, I am looking forward to seeing her in other movies. Charlie Sheen looked a little bored, but so were we watching 'Signs'. In any day but a bad one, you should enjoy this film. 7 out of 10 on my personal scale. One more thing - if you watch it on DVD, look for the alternate ending. It is at least as good as the one that was left in the official version. It is actually much more than just an ending, it is a full different last quarter of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First You Saw Scary Movie, Then You Went to See Scary Movie 2, But They Were Nothing Compared to What Came Next: Scary Movie 3!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!] Late one night, two girls Becca and Kate, stayed up late. They were blond so you know they were discussing boys and boobs. Then, Becca discusses a video tape that once watched, you received a phone call from someone who says you are going to die. Seven days later, you do. Becca and Kate explore some strange noises in the house and when they meet up again, Becca finds Kate decapitated. Becca worried that she might be hurt; In Washington D.C., a former priest turned farmer, Tom, noticed a strange crop circle that said ATTACK HERE and pointed to Tom's house. Cindy Campbell, now a reporter, did a story on it and found it very interesting, but her editor told her to forget it and report on what the station was famous for: hookers, sports and orgies. Cindy goes to pick up her little nephew, Cody, from school. Cody was clairvoyant and could see the future. He drew pictures of a strange, long black haired woman standing before a large black hole. Cody's school teacher was Cindy's old friend, Brenda Meeks. Cindy developed a crush on Cody's friend Sue's uncle, George, who was a bumbling rap artist. Cindy and Brenda go to see George rap that night before a tough crowd. His friend, Mahalik, was there to help him, along with his little friend C.J. So, George was able to out-rap Fat Joe. Brenda asked Cindy to stay with her that night, because a week ago Brenda had viewed that tape mentioned earlier. Brenda scared Cindy to death 3 times with 3 fake accidents. But suddenly, the TV turned itself on and a large, ugly, long haired woman crawled out. She and Brenda fight, then suddenly...Cindy enters the room to find Brenda murdered. Her funeral takes place the next day. George and Mahalik try to bring Brenda back to life but in the process end up blowing her corpse to pieces. Cindy becomes more and more curious about that tape. She goes to seek help from a psychic, Aunt Shaneequa and they view the tape and they find more than meets the eyes! Bumbling, stumbling George is left to babysit Cody and nearly kills him numerous times. Cindy discovers a strange lighthouse on the tape and travels to it, only to meet a strange old man, The Architect, who pervertidly spied on Cindy for many years; At the White House, President Harris, suspected an alien attack from the jumbled news report he heard. It was caused when Cindy, Carson Ward, an janitor Zubie. The President suspected some strange men at the White House were aliens and he and the Secret Service began beating them up. At Tom's house, he discovers Sue had disappeared and in her place: Michael Jackson! He and Tom fight ala Moonwalker, then Michael disappears. George and Cody soon show up, followed by Cindy. They barricade themselves inside, just as the aliens arrive. They say hello by strangling people. They say goodbye by kicking the testicles, and they urinate from their fingers. Soon, the creepy woman from the video tape arrives. It turns out that was Tabitha, a long lost girl who was evil incarnate. She was once Architect's daughter. She spread her evil onto the tape and a mix-up from Architect, who thought the film was Pooty Tang, saw the tape going into circulation and killing innocents. Cindy and Cody confront Tabitha while George and Tom proceed to nearly kill one another trying to keep out the aliens. As a result, the aliens turned out to be friendly. They were after Tabitha, who soon falls down the same well from the tape. Tom seals the well. Evil Tabitha is gone forever. George and Cindy get married and drive off, planning to live happily ever after. But where was Cody? When they go back for him, he's wiped out by a mack truck.  Scary Movie the third--very funny! Very! Sexy Anna Faris returns as Cindy--and this time she's blond! Regina Hall returns as Brenda Meeks who's killed a second time in this series. In Scary Movie 1, she was stabbed to death. You'll notice that Shorty Meeks and Ray are not in this movie. This is because the Wayans brothers had nothing to do with this movie. This one was directed by David Zucker, so you know it was still going to be funny. Also in the cast: Charlie Sheen, Anthony Anderson, Queen Latifah, Eddie Griffen, Jenny McCarthy, Pamela Lee Anderson, Michael Jackson, Fat Joe, Leslie Nielsen, D.L. Hughely, George Carlin, Master P, and Darrell Hammond. This was so much better than Scary Movie 2, which was stupid and pointless. Can we expect a Scary Movie 4? I heard that one is coming in 2004. How about a Scary Movie 5? I have no reason to doubt it. Scary Movie 6? 7? 8? 9? 10? Sure, why not? But anyway, if you want a great comedy this summer, see good old Scary Movie 3. The first Scary Movie since Scary Movie 2. After all, all good trilogies come in threes. See it today! It is well worth the high cost of tickets! Whassup, y'all! Scary Movie 3 is all that!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They still got it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The brilliant creators of "Airplane" bring us back to the non-stop slap stick comedy of "Scary Movie 3". In my opinion, this is my favorite Scary Movie out of the three so far, this was just too much for words to say how funny it was. I never had such a good time in the theater, I even saw it 3 times because I just couldn't get enough laughs.The movies are now: Signs, 8 Mile, The Others, The Ring, and The Matrix movies. We have two old friends, Anna Farris back as Cindy and Regina Hall back as Brenda. We have a new and more fun cast with Leislie Neilson, Charlie Sheen, Denese Richards, Simon Rex, and the two that stole the movie Anthony Anderson and Kevin Hart. Together they brought together a movie that would not stop with the great comedy. Despite it being a very short movie, it makes you just want to watch it again and again.I'm not sure which was my favorite parody, I think it was either the rap battle where Simon plays George as Eminem in 8 Mile and they had that great cameo of Simon from American Idol. Of course, I enjoyed the Michael Jackson joke, I just was dying of that line "How do you like it, huh?" representing Michael dangling his baby in Berlin earlier this year and now Charlie Sheen gets the chance to give Michael his own medicine. Every scene is a great one, trust me, this is by far the best Scary Movie. You'll have a great time.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest movies ever created!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.In this hilarious third installment of the "scary movie" series, Anna Faris is back as Cindy Campbell, who has now graduated from college and is a reporter. Along with her friend Brenda Meeks (regina hall) Cindy finds out about a mysterious video tape that kills whoever watches it 7 days later (spoofing "The Ring") while doing a story about a mysterious crop circle that has appeared in Tom Logan's (Charlie Sheen) yard. Then, with the help of George (Simon Rex) Cindy has to stop an alien invasion.I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious. I've heard a lot of people say negative things about the plot, jokes, etc. why? because those people think too much! This movie is supposed to be totally mindless - and it is, and that's what makes it funny! I mean, why complain about "Scary Movie 3" when there's crap out there like "Scary Movie 2"???Top 10 funniest Quotes/scenes10) BRENDA: Cindy...the TV's leaking!9) PRESIDENT HARRIS: These men and woman have died fighting for their country. Send flowers to their bitches and ho's.8) Cody is drawing Tabitha (aka Samara) and he made a flipbook of her doing a little dance. it's hilarious (you have to see it to get it)7) GEORGE: (in the rap battle) I'm a white boy but my neck is red I put miracle whip on my wonder bread6) SHERIFF: Watch...what happens...to the taco!5) George is at a rap battle full of African Americans and he puts his hood on...and over his hat, it looks like a cone, like a KKK personBLACK GUY: Au $hit!4) CINDY: Oh, cody! Are you having one of your visions?CODY: I see a little girl. With black hair. She wants to kill you. Your period starts in three...two...one...CINDY: Oww...Cody, what else can you see?CODY: I see a little boy and a grown woman, but no father...CINDY: Oh, Cody...CODY: I see you kneeling in dog $hit...3) Tabitha is leaking water from the well all over Brenda's floor.BRENDA: Cindy, this b*tch is messin' up my floor!!!2) CINDY: I just feel like I want something more than just good sex...BRENDA: Yeah, I know. you want commitment.CINDY: No, I want GREAT sex!BRENDA: Girl, I know what you talking' about! You want a guy that goes wham wham wham!(a little preschooler stares at Brenda)BRENDA: DID I SAY STOP DRAWING???1) GEORGE: Okay, then. Fresh. I'll see you guys uh, tomorrow night!(he turns around and takes his niece out the door)(someone throws a huge container of crayons at the door)BRENDA: Now who the f*ck did that???!!!Also, I've heard a number of complaints about how Cody keeps getting hit by cars, basketballs, and thrown out of windows, etc. I mean, it's not like he got hurt while filming it!!The only reason this movie didn't get a ten was the michael jackson scene. I thought that was totally disgusting/gross.The opening scene with pamela anderson was one of the funniest things I've ever seen....(i.e. "Are you okay...?" "I'm coming for you, precious...") I totally recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Much Better Than The Last Two Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This time Scary Movie does not only make fun of the horror movie alone. And also the least perverted of the three, making this the least favorite among the fans. This time Cindy, a news reporter have to face with the killer videotape (The Ring), Alien Invading and Its Crop Circle (Sighs), A stupid white rapper (8 Miles), and prophecy of The One (The Matrix) also little from Michael Jackson (The Others).To me, this is the best of the three, with a decent storyline and making fun of. Some of the stuff is damn funny too, and it doesn't have to be semen exploding. Overall it provides much more than the first two with a good and intelligence joke. (Though some of it might be crude).Reason To Watch: · Anna Faris look her best, · Better casting than the last two, · Better joke than previous two.Reason Not To: · Not perverted at all, so the fan might not enjoy it. · Not very much a teen movie anymore.Rating: 7/10 (Grade: C+)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie with two of my friends and none of us liked it. Even for people who like stupid humor, this movie is completely inane. I know because my friends like some idiotic movies. I may have laughed a total of 3 times and that was only due to timing. The jokes could only be found funny by someone with the maturity of a 14 year old or younger. Simon Rex's jokes especially fell flat. When George Carlin appeared, I began to have hope. Sadly, he never rose to my expectations. Come on George, you're better than that. The biggest casting error was Ja Rule as a secret service agent. He seemed vacant and lost, as if he couldn't remember his lines or he didn't know how he even got on the movie set. I would try to mention a standout performance, but there were none. My friends and I were constantly checking our watches and hoping the movie would end. The fact that anyone liked this crap scares me. It represents the overall degradation of the intelligence of the general population. I'll bet anyone that liked SM3 doesn't understand a word I just said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant spoof of a spoof...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps this is a spoof of a spoof, perhaps that's what it's all about. Some hip producer got the smart idea of spoofing one of those lousy spoof movies that pokes fun at genre favourites without actually making anybody laugh. Perhaps the makers were so successful in their endeavour that they fooled us all, and have produced a work of sublime perfection. Perhaps this is the pinnacle ? aaah, you're not buying it are you? You know this movie is just a threadbare string of half-baked jokes that look like they were dreamed up on the back of some fifteen-year-old's school exercise book. When all's said and done, AIRPLANE sure has a lot to answer for, and there's something a little sad in the fact that at least one of the producers of that epic trailblazer hasn't moved on in ? what ? 23 years? I suppose there will always be a market for this kind of film while there are excitable teenage boys willing to watch any kind of flimsy material in the hopes of catching a glimpse of Pamela Anderson's baps and the Coors Light twins in bikinis, but for the rest of us this is pretty lame stuff. Pamela Anderson is quite amusing in a prologue that parodies the beginning of THE RING, catching the audience with a weary glance as her friend goes on about some tape in which "they do it on the boat and then in the car and then in the bathtub. And he's like 'Hey baby, I love you," and she's like 'Where are we?' And did you see the size?". Leslie Nielsen also pleases in what amounts to little more that a cameo role. It's the kind of part he must be able to play in his sleep by now, but he's always fun to watch. And there's one clever moment when our heroine (Anna Faris) jumps at the sound of a ferry's horn that introduces the following unconnected scene. The rest of the movie is just a procession of lame jokes aimed at The Matrix, The Ring, Sixth Sense and, for some unfathomable reason, Mel Gibson's Crapstravanza, SIGNS. That's right, the spoof genre is so played out the makers have started lampooning movies that are even worse than the one they are making.As another reviewer on this site often says, 'you can do something better with this part of your life': sort out your sock drawer, iron the cat, syringe your ears, the options are countless?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe I paid $4.50 to see this. Nothing on earth can give me back the 84 minutes of my life that I lost viewing this monstrosity. The only thing that I'm glad that didn't happen as a result of this movie was me having a seizure for having watched something so stupid in short a period of time.I didn't expect a cinematic masterpiece. I didn't even expect anything good. But how much testicular humor can one movie HAVE? Oh, look, he's getting kicked in the testicles, LET'S LAUGH! and why Leslie why??? Not even the bravada of Leslie Nielsen could save this picture. To me the whole thing seemed like an 84 minute Saturday Night Live sketch gone bad. Please burn the negatives and bury the film in a vault deep underground. All I can say is that it's a shame this movie made as much as it did. I mourn for the film industry if something like this can become a success. Stop it now before it bores again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't very thrilled to hear that a third SCARY MOVIE was being made, but I decided to check it out anyway since David Zucker was the director and just like with all David Zucker's previous movies, this one was hilarious! With one of the best cast of all time, SCARY MOVIE 3 has a lot going for it. First off, it spoofs not just horror movies, but crap flicks like 8 MILE as well. Second, it actually has a decent plot unlike the first two SCARY MOVIE films, and third, it is extremely well paced. Besides being absolutely hilarious, the cinematography is excellent. The movie looks great for a lowbrow comedy. Can't wait for SCARY MOVIE 4. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as spoof comedies go, Scary Movie 3 isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't good either. It's a huge improvement over the awful second film in the franchise, but it fails to deliver enough laughs to be able to recommend it.The film delivers a few laughs here and there thanks to a few surprisingly clever jokes and slapstick bit, but it feels like the writers went for too many cheap jokes and slapstick humor. The two main parodies are Signs and The Ring which the film does an alright job of poking fun at, but there is a lot of wasted opportunity in poking fun of these films as well. One of the problems with the last film as that it parodied films that weren't even part of the horror genre and these moments felt rather forced and out of place than funny. This film suffers from that problem as well parodying 8 Mile and The Matrix. Neither of these moments are funny nor clever and feel like a cheap attempt to parody other recent films that were popular at the time of release. This wouldn't be a problem if the film was not suppose to be a spoof of horror films and these moments weren't taking away screen time that could have been used to poke fun at the films part of the actual genre it's suppose to be spoofing. Anna Faris was alright in the lead, but I was really disappointed by how underused Charlie Sheen was.Scary Movie 3 isn't terrible compared to a lot of other spoof movies out there. It does have a couple of funny moments, but the laughs are far in-between a great deal of cheap jokes and tired slapstick humor to be able to recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary Movie 3 is a great spoof and lives up to the first two. Faris, Hall, Rex, Sheen and Leslie star and Zucker directs. Humorous is as humorous gets.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remembering back to the year of 2006. That was the year in which I first seen Scary Movie 3. When you're a kid back in 2006, like I was, you're unaware of lots of things and you don't understand as much about things. I didn't really understand much about the film, but that's not necessarily meaning I didn't find it funny, or liked it, because I did. I loved it in fact. It genuinely made me laugh. I must point out that a lot of it I found funny then, I don't find as funny now, and a lot of it I didn't get or understand back then, I find very funny now and understand it completely. It's somewhat different from the first two, because it's a different cast (except Anna Faris and Regina Hall return in the film and they're two of the main stars). So what's this one about? Well, it's about two girls that are talking about a tape (humorously, it's a spoof of 'The Ring')and after a few odd and eerie occurrences, they both die. It also takes us to a farm in which two clumsy brothers, George (Simon Rex) and Tom Logan (Charlie Sheen) find and come across a crop circle on their farm (humorously, it's a spoof of Signs). From there on, it's all laughs, gags, humour and comedy. I find this film to be very comedic and humorous with stuff you wouldn't see in the first two films. There's even a plastic-looking (Fe)male Michael Jackson in it, in one scene. Enjoyably, a good and funny film. 7.0/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3, basically a spoof of The Ring, Signs, a bit of The Matrix and its sequel the Matrix Reloaded, and a bit of 8 Mile. Scary Movie 3 may possibly be the scariest of the Scary Movie lot, but it does not over do it and also includes laughs.Scary Movie 3 is basically a video tape that seems to be killing people 7 days after watching a video tape. Cindy Campbell decides to investigate with the help of her friend and nephews school teacher Brenda Meeks. Meanwhile, crop circles are appearing on a farmer (Tom's) farm. Tom and his brother decide to investigate eventually leading Cindy and the two to meet where they discover the crop circles and the videotape are somehow linked...A lot of people having given this film mixed reviews but I believe that this film isn't bad! But it isn't brilliant, Scary Movie 3 is just very good! It is funny but the acting is not good, the plots good, but not brilliant. So, to sum all this up Scary Movie 3 is good and very funny. So if I were you I'd just watch it for the sake of a few laughs!</fullReview>

It's 1,000,000 times better then any other recent spoof movies like Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet The Spartans, and Disaster Movie. Those movies gave spoof movie a bad name. It's a lot funnier when you spoof a celebrity and the spoof movie actually has the celebrity they are spoofing. Like the part in this movie when they made fun of American Idol and it actually had Simon Cowell in a brief cameo. It was hilarious when they made fun of 8 Mile but didn't they forget that this is called 'Scary Movie 3' and it's supposed to spoof scary movies not music/drama's or sci-fi's like 'The Matrix'. But I can see why spoofed those movies so the plot of this movie could make more sense. This spoof movie actually has a plot and the other spoof movies I mentioned hardly even have a plot at all.

		<fullReview>While this film is good, it really does fail to meet the standards of the previous two movies. The absences of Marlon Wayans and Regina Hall (who is only in around half of the film) is hugely noticed with all of Hall's scenes being the best in the movie (these scenes including Brenda's death and funeral). Simon Rex is a nice addition to the cast for the film also.A large part of the film is in parody to The Ring and many of the scenes which refer to the film have some great moments. Particularly those involving Tabitha and Brenda and the final scene where Cindy, George, Codey and Tom all confront Tabitha.Recommended but don't expect the same quality as the previous two.</fullReview>

But I didn't feel that the rest of the cast were that good. There is a few things they don't seem to get though, MJ jokes are old news. Get over them, just NOT funny.

Equal to the equally crappy part two, but in a more straightforward slapstick tone, as usual the jokes are rarely a full on hit, but ultimately justify the few rare hilarious moments, in the lackluster combo plot of The Ring &amp; Signs. Even as Zucker tries to transition smoothly from the Waynes popular dominance featuring his 8 mile homage, sadly this time whitey does not win for comedy. Somehow the franchise went from one decent opener to settling into a complete cash cow intent on sheer mediocrity, a bleedin shame since the world could use some first class slapstick right now, not a pale ghost of the former glory days where one gag is parlayed for several generations across several body parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not as good as the first scary movie but it was still really funny. Most people didn't like this movie because they probably compared it to the first which is hard to find a movie funnier than the first other than The Producers, Office Space and The Blues Brothers. Most of the jokes in this movie were hilarious. The reason that they went from an R rating (the first 2) to a PG-13 is because they wanted to attract more people, so people over 13 can go. They got a lot of good actors to play in this movie, like Charlie Sheen, Anna Faris, Leslie Nelson, Queen Latifa etc...... One of the funniest parts of this movie was when they were making fun of the Matrix with the oracle and Morpheous in the same room. They made a great job making fun of every movie. Overall this was really funny and I recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anna Faris, Charlie Sheen, Anthony Anderson, Leslie Nielsen, and so it goes on ... the list is long and impressive. There are a feast of quality comic actors, producing a genuinely funny movie. Given the talent on show it would be surprising if it wasn't funny, and unlike a lot of movie series Scary keeps on delivering the goods.The resemblance to Zucker's previous spoofs is obvious, and although I was very happy with Wayans' direction for 1 &amp; 2 this isn't too different in style to be disappointing, and many may prefer the Airplane- &amp; Naked Gun-style comedy. Sheen is a genius actor - much under-rated - and Anderson is always value for money - if a little stifled here. Cindy's prevalence towards open-mouthed astonishment does start to wear a little thin after 3 movies, but Anna is such a beautiful, talented and funny girl that I just don't care! I guess you either love or hate these movies, but for me there's never been a funnier series and I look forward to plenty more. Oh and did I mention, I love you Anna!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoof movie with a myriad of unimaginative gags</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This third chapter deals about Cindy(Anna Faris)who must to protect a kid and relates with his brother,a white rapper(Simon Rex)and the father(Charlie Sheen).Besides investigate strange crop circles and eerie videotapes and shunning an Alian invaders with the intervention of the stupidest President(Leslie Nielsen).Cindy is back ,this time to save America from a plot Alien invasion for world domination.She thwart the plans and saves the kid from a ghostly creature.From the start to the ending the humor and the laughters are innumerable. Lots of gags and sketch,some of them funny but movie lacks the freshness of the first and second installment. This is a hilarious parody,surrealist,extreme spoof and gross out though less than its predecessors but also is intelligent and bold. As always the cinematographic references are numerous and provide silly laughs from start to finish,the amusement is guess what films result to be ,thus : ¨Sings¨and ¨The ring¨ specially but also ¨8 miles¨¨The others¨with a ironic gag of Michael Jackson,and with a President(a deadpan Nielsen) similar to ¨Air Force One¨. The picture contains loads of fun here and there and a passel of cameo appearances as Pamela Anderson,Jenny McCarthy,Queen Latifah,Eddie Griffin and rappers,JA Rule,Master P,Method man. The movie is directed by David Zucker,he along with his brother Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams are famous American satirists(ZAZ),they are directors and writers with successful work and long time collaborators,making their own comedy troupe(The Kentucky Fried). The motion picture will like to lunatic humor and absurd comedy enthusiastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This series of spoofs are not supposed to be very good, and they succeed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The current IMDb rating for this movie is 5.3, and somewhere between 5 and 6 is about right. It opens with Pam Anderson and Jenny McCarthy playing two bimbos who have heard that too many TV waves in the air will cause silicone molecules to shrink, and they go crazy over that, which sets the tone for the entire movie.Anna Farris as Cindy Campbell is arguably the main star of this movie. While several movies are spoofed, it eventually settles on "The Ring" where those who watch a videotape get a call that they will die in 7 days. There is a funny scene when Cindy is questioning the caller, is it 7 calendar days or 7 working days? What about holidays, next week is Martin Luther King day."Signs" is also spoofed, involving a former minister (Sheen) and crop circles made by aliens. Unlike the real "Signs" where we only get a quick glimpse of the aliens, here we see Earthlings interacting with them quite a lot. There are a few funny sight gags.However, one doesn't watch a movie like this for a worthwhile story. It is just light, goofy entertainment, and it succeeds pretty well at that, but only if you recognize the movies being spoofed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Parodies in every direction once again as the Wayans' brothers original concept to make fun of horror films falls into the hands of director David Zucker (one of the masterminds behind "Airplane!" and "The Naked Gun") with strikingly terrible results. Strange occurrences ala "Signs" mix with an outrageously stupid "8 Mile" side-story that transpires into nothing but a cinematic mess. Anna Faris and Regina Hall reprise their roles and we have cornball additions in the forms of Leslie Nielsen, Charlie Sheen and Anthony Anderson. Oh goodness will films like this ever go the way of the dodo? Box office numbers say.......apparently not. Turkey (0 stars out of 5).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now THIS is a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course I liked the first two Scary Movies. They were hilarious. However, they were all just visual gags and disgusting toilet humour. In my opinion, it was a genius move having David Zucker take over for the Wayans Brothers because he's got a different style of humour...A style of humour that I find FAR funnier. Slapstick and word gags. David Zucker was responsible for the film Airplane! which is one of the greatest film comedies of all time, so I think it's great that he put his style into the Scary Movie franchise.The star power this time around is awesome. We've still got Cindy and Brenda, but now there's appearances by old comedy pros such as Leslie Nielsen and George Carlin. Even Charlie Sheen did a good job in this movie, even though he's not the best actor in the world. This Scary Movie is a spoof on Signs and The Ring, and the way they connect the two movies is genius.There's nothing much else I can say except the style of humour in this Scary Movie is SO much better than the first 2 and it's really refreshing to have a parody genius like Zucker take over for the over indulgent Wayans Brothers. This movie was the hardest I've laughed at a movie in a long time. Awesome.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a comedy movie person. Horror movies... nah, creep me out. They also give me too much suspense. This is almost the same with Scary Movie 3, only the suspense isn't that something bad is going to happen, your just on the edge of your seat, ready for the next joke, which comes just at the right time. This movie is honestly one of the funniest things I've seen. With spoofs from The Sixth Sense, Signs, and the Ring, this movie will have you rolling on the floor, dieing of laughter. Despite what some people may say, you don't have to have seen the movie to get the jokes, you do need to know the basic plot of them though. The movie also through in some of Airplane! in there. I watched this at a friends house, and the day I saw it, I went home and ordered it online. Its just that funny. If you don't like comedies, then why are you even reading this? Scary Movie 3 will live in our hearts and minds for ever... unless Scary Movie 4 is better... then Scary Movie 4 will live in our hearts and minds forever... but for now, its all scary movie 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3: This time around, aim is taken at such horror blockbusters as Signs and The Ring, while films of other genres, including Independence Day, 8 Mile, and The Matrix, are also lampooned. The plot finds Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) trying to help the president (Leslie Nielsen) thwart an alien attack while also facing crop circles and a mysterious video tape. That is basically the plot summary in a nutshell.Well... all I can say about Scary Movie 3 is that it's the most gut bustingly hilarious, laugh your ass off movie I have ever seen in my entire life!! This movie is genius!! I have never been so impressed with a comedy in my life. It made me laugh so much that I was in tears by the end.

The way she gasps for air before she says certain lines just makes her sound clueless yet not annoying. She is truly an all-around great actress she can be serious,funny serious-funny. Usually the "blonde" lines a predictable, we can almost sense when someone is going to act like a bimbo, but with Anna's amazing acting skills you never know. She definitely can keep the viewers curious about what she is going to say next. Even though the Wayans are not actually in this movie, it is a hell of a lot funnier and cameos by Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy it's hard not to pee your pants. Clueless blondes being clueless was definitely something needed in a film, and there is no better way then have them do it, in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best Scary Movie in my book. This movie is funny as hell. I loved how the little boy Cody always got hit with something. Making fun of The Ring was a good idea to do. The name Tabitha was weird but having Lesile Nelson do his Were Counting On You line from Airplane. That movie Airplane was so long ago. Any way Scary Movie 3 brings you laughs and terror at the same time. I just wonder why such a low rating from the critics. This movie was funny as hell in my mind and I would watch it 2 times in one day. Anna Faris, Anthony Anderson, Lesile Nelson, and Charlie Sheen all star in this slapstick of a horror comedy in one movie. I loved this movie.</fullReview>

Cindy replies, "no we have to stick to the crop circle story!" In the mean time Rob is sitting at the news desk and banging the desk and made out that he was masturbating and said "Thank you, Cindy......"! That would have been outragously funny.

		<fullReview>I seem to be one of the few people who actually liked - or am prepared to admit to liking - Scary Movie 2. A film that was joyous in its own stupidity, and contained more laughs than the original with its over the top antics.Scary Movie 3 isn't really a Scary Movie sequel at all though. Not only do its best jokes come from non-horror films, but it sees the underrated Wayans brothers ship out their franchise to the same people that made Naked Gun and Hot Shots.As a result what had dared to try and be different in the "irony for the hard of thinking" world of Hollywood spoof movies was now absorbed back into the formulaic world of self-satisfied unfunniness.Leslie Neilson - a man who stops Steve Martin winning "smuggest, unfunniest white-haired guy of the year" every year running, isn't actually so bad in this particular movie, but what we essentially have is a parade of tepid mugging to camera and Caucasians without a natural flair for comedy thinking that saying stuff with tongue in cheek equates humour. It doesn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>by Lindsie Marcus.Scary Movie 3 is an wildly outrageous, funny movie. Anna Faris, playing Cindy Campbell, and Simon Rex, playing George, make Scary Movie 3 a thrilling and crazy adventure. Cindy Campbell is troubled by the unusual problems Cody (played by Drew Manheim) has throughout the movie.Scary Movie 3 was crazy, funny, and stupid. This movie was crazy because of the aliens. The aliens made Scary Movie 3 become more interesting and added a twist. This movie was funny! Every other thing that happened in Scary Movie 3 was funny. I personally think the battle was a big laugh.Stupid would be a good definition for Scary Movie 3. Poor Cody helps make this movie so stupid. It seems Cody gets forgotten by Cindy Campbell and George several times. He also seems to get hit with many things: the car(several times), a hammer, and a door.This movie seemed to revolve around the movie The Ring. In the end Scary Movie 3 was a wild movie with a dramatic ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With such horror movies like, Scream and I know What You Did Last Summer. Keenan Ivory Wayans was able to spawn Scary Movie. Scary Movie was hilarious and basically made fun of the teen horror films like Scream. I remember watching it and laughing my head off. Scary Movie 2 was awful and terrible and not remotely funny whatsoever. It seem like the Scary Movie series was done. But not so. Now we get a new director named David Zucker (Airplane and Naked Gun series) and some of the same cast from the first minus Shawn and Marlon Wayans and added some funny spoof from Signs, The Ring and Matrix Reloaded and now we have a step up from Scary Movie 2.Anna Faris is back as Cindy Campbell and Regina Hall is back as Brenda Meeks. Let's face it without Anna and Regina, the Scary Movie series can just basically stop. They both are hilarious. A tape that kills you in seven days is swirling around that Cindy saw and now she is trying to warn everyone about it.The movie does some funny spoof of Signs (yeah, they stick it to Shaymalan again), The Ring, Matrix Reloaded, and 8 Mile . It is not as funny as The R rated Scary Movie but it has that Airplane comedy feel and it made me chuckle a lot and is 10 times better than the second installment.So if you want a good laugh at some crazy spoofs, watch Scary Movie 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can be said about the third movie in a series of horror spoofs that have progressively deteriorated? As with both previous films, the previews we see over and over again give away the best moments before we see them in the theater. The opening sequence with Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy is one of these moments. Conversely, there's nothing like seeing scenes in previews that are cut from the movie, like Queen Latifah's frying pan scene. I saw the movie with probably less than 20 people and there were almost no laughs in the audience through the entire movie. No matter, Scary Movie 4 is already in the works right now; because, what really matters is that this movie made over $100,000,000. This film was directed by David Zucker and not Keenen Ivory Wayans, which means there's a welcome relief from the extremely juvenile bodily fluid, fart, and sexual jokes that plagued the second film. There is one funny bit with the aliens that is an exception however. As with most of Zucker's films, the gags and jokes are rapid-fire and misfire. Most of them are misfires. The gags are very loosely strung together with bits from several recent movies, including The Ring and Signs. Some of the scenes are shockingly unfunny, like the one with the girl fight with the girl from The Ring. I kept wondering what more there was going to be to scenes like these in the movie, and then realized there wasn't anything else coming. Some of the scenes are embarrassingly labored too, like Charlie Sheen's scene with Denise Richards. The next installment is going to be focused on superhero films where I'm sure Hulk and Spider-man will be targets. Anna Faris and Regina Hall, the only two leftovers from the first two films, should have an opening sequence in Scary Movie 4 where they bludgeon all the Wayans brothers to death and then ax each other. That would take about 10 minutes of footage. Then we can watch 70 minutes of blank film and laugh at how empty the rest of the film is. 1/2 star of 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aliens III, Lethal Weapon III, Matrix Revolutions, Return of the Jedi, Scream III, all these movies have something in common: they are the weakest of a trilogy (keep in mind that Star Wars was once a trilogy).It seems the people behind these films ran out of the ideas they had for the first two in the series. Scary Movie III, however, seems to be a rare exception. Maybe because the first two Scary Movies weren't that good to begin with.In Scary Movie III, the Wayans brother seem to have exploited the good things about the first two: lots of people getting punched, hit with bats, cars, etc, people being stupid, stumbling, etc. And of course, making fun of horror and science fiction films. Last but not least, they seem to have realized that some people don't find disgusting scenes funny at all.This film has a lot of scenes that can make you laugh as long as you like spoof films. The funeral scenes is one of the best I have ever seen. Then there is the alien footage scenes. And the unforgettable scenes mocking the Matrix series.Many films of this type have been terrible. Mafia, for example, made me leave the theater, and I hadn't done that before, no matter how bad the movie was. Not Another Stupid American Movie was beyond stupid and made me wonder if it was time to stop making this type of films. Scary Movie has revitalized them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Films In Its Own Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw its trailer, I really thought this movie would be a total letdown. But surprisingly, it is kind of funny. Actually, I think this is the best in the Scary Movie series.It showcases great acting like Anna Faris and Simon Rex (both very hot people) and the plot makes it even more worth watching. The cameos are excellent, especially by Pamela Anderson, Jenny McCarthy and the spoofs don't really have to be understood by watching the spoofed movies. The slapstick humour appeals to everyone and luckily, this time, the sexual humour doesn't fall flat like a deflated balloon.It is certainly one of the best films of its kind, overtaking gross out comedies of this year. Watching it more than twice will never give you the bores and if you are a fan of slapstick comedies, this is a must watch.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm glad this movie concentrates on funny dialogue rather than the vomit and sex that dominated the last scary movie. In their attempt to parody the many different stories the plot is mostly forgotten, but its not important.The opening scene is good but really, these kind of parodies are best shown at the beginning of the MTV awards, its painful to cover so many for so long and still attempt to have a connecting story.See this one over the first two, but its not as hilarious as everyone makes out. Brenda is the best character. Anna Faris is better as a blonde.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With stars like Ja Rule, Leslie Nielsen, DL Hughley, Eddie Griffin, Camryn Mannheim, Charlie Sheen and so many others this should be a great comedy. It is far from a great comedy. It is even more disappointing that this was a movie done by the famous Zuckers, who brought us the Naked Gun and Airplane series. This is an overall awful movieI will give this movie credit, the previews were actually made to be funnier than the film. I did not like Scary Movie 2 and I thought to make this movie was pointless until I saw the previews and thought it might be funny. This was not a funny movie. Not only that but the scenes in the previews were actually funnier than the movie itself. There is no plot, no laugh out loud movie, the Zuckers have rally gone down hill. What happened to their Naked Gun days?The biggest disappointment was Leslie Nielsen, one of the funniest men in films was in this piece of crap, why Leslie, why? There is no plot to this movie, there is so many disjointed scenes that do not go together. I think the script writers just said hey, this might be kind of funny, really didn't know for sure, but went with it anyway. I could have written a funnier movie than this.</fullReview>

With a movie like this, you're always taking a chance when going to it whether or not it will be worth the $7. This movie certainly was not.

		<fullReview>Laugh at it or with it, but please laugh. If you go to this movie expecting a serious or aesthetic piece of filmmaking please hit yourself in the face. It's supposed to be funny and stupid and make you laugh. I found myself nearly in tears during the scene of the newscasts showing the alien footage. Havings seen both "Signs" and "The Ring", it was helpful to have some knowledge of those films which were being mocked. Those who have seen neither film might get lost but it shouldn't matter too much.Two things that amazed me about this film were1. The ridiculous stereotypes of the black people in the movie. I guess the Wayans think it's O.K. to make Amos and Andy since they are black.2. The callousness towards violence against children.Some gags in the film were either carried on longer than a bad SNL skit or simply passed over too quickly. Anyhoo, it's worth going if you don't take it seriously and have fun with the premise.</fullReview>

The jokes weren't funny, the story wasn't funny, the characters (except for maybe Pamela) weren't funny. The whole thing was just in bad taste. I'm not religious, but I particularly disliked the cheap shots at priests. It was just bad, very bad.

		<fullReview>Where should I start? First of all, I lost interest for the movie when I heard that the Wayans brothers were not involved in the film. Then I saw the PG-13 rating, and that totally threw me off. I figured I would go check it out just to see how it was. I saw the previous "Scary Movie", it should be good like the others right? Wrong ! Instead I saw a highly anticipated film fall flat from the start. The film lacked the raunchy humor that the Wayans brothers started with "Scary Movie" and "Scary Movie 2". There were only two funny scenes but after that, everything went downward. The advertisements constantly playing the Michael Jackson scene made the scene so corney. I sat in a jam packed theater for ninety minutes just to be bored silly. And I wasn't the only one in theater thinking that way. when the film finished, everyone wanted their money back.

		<fullReview>I just took my son to the opening day afternoon matinee right after school. We had primo seats, a big honker of popcorn, and lots of anticipation. Our favorite movies are Used Cars, Hot Shots Deux, and Airplane, so we were barely able to sit in our seats as the endless previews were shown. Then the movie came on.....Though there were some good gags and in-jokes there (and most of them you see in the trailers), the movie was very tame, and did not have the zippy editing and pace of the above-mentioned classics. Some of the gags fell flat but continued painfully along. The Queen Latifah "I'm going to prophesize this pan right up your..." that is shown in the previews is not even included (my son noticed that). The movie seemed to stumble along. Even Leslie Nielsen was way off his game. Anyone who did not see Sixth Sense, 8 Mile, Ring, or Signs had better bring a pillow, because they won't get enough of it to keep them awake. An older woman near us appeared quite unamused and bewildered by the whole thing.A very disappointed 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok. we have officially hit rock bottom.I guess I should start off by saying I came out of the theater feeling a bit exploited. We all say how the good moments are in the trailers. Then when we see the movie we are so let down. I never felt suckered into shelling out six bucks until Scary Movie 3.It's major problem is with excess. This movie has too much of everything. There's too many movies parodied. Too many cameos, too many comedy killer jokes(white hood joke, Simon Cowell getting wacked), too many repeated gags. There's a point where they want you to laugh at a million three stooges kung fu fight sequences that go on way too long where you just want to scream "OK I get it already!Move On!"And when the plot decides to lurch forward it seems a little random and arbitrary, sorta like a drunken driver lost and driving a sports car he's never driven before.It's just smacking into one car after another. Sometimes it's plows into garbage bags The movie just keeps rolling out one skit and character after another cutting the good ones short in order to cram some more in.Nothing gets to develop not characters, not the jokes, not even the parody of the movies. It has no true central story to hold it together. Towards the end of its 90(thank you) minutes it throws in the same scenes of ghost slapping and kid smacking, and ball kicking that we already saw before. But of course we're supposed to laugh at it.Aren't We?It's a shame and quite embarrassing that one of the Zucker Bros and Kevin Smith have their names on this. If their was one sentence to describe this movie it would be Airplane on a drug addled bender.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure if it's me getting older or the films are becoming less funny. I thought the Scary Movie franchise always prided it self on how far they could push an R rating. And here's one pushing a PG-13. The film isn't really bad. Anna Faris is good as usual(but not as good) the material is scarce and uninvolving. Simon Rex is gorgeous and a little funny. Charlie Sheen is hokie, the cameos are mostly unfunny(Eddie Griffin,Macy Gray, Denise Richards) and Leslie Nielsen is just ok. Much like the film. There is a standout scene between Pamela Anderson and Jenny Mccarthy at the beginning that garners some well desrved chuckles. But the films lacks the subtext to really spoof the films their making fun of. Instead we get a retread of those tired jokes an incompetent audience member makes while watching the original films. The film isn't completely bad like I said. But the laughs are scarce, the story is quite messy and the it's just altogether the last nail in the coffin for the dropping franchise. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wayans's better than Zucker...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like I said, I assume that wayans is better than Zucker so much after watching Scary movie 3... it's just my thinking.. don't throw rocks at me...First, I thank to Zucker pretty much. The scary movie series has lost their creators, The Wayans family. You know why? Even though they got good Scary movie 1 w/ lots of money, they all put their money in Scary movie 2. And it's all "devastated". All critics, all movie "people"... blamed the wayans family. Now, all responsibilities left to Zucker, even though he knew that he might be blamed by everyone. That's one of what I wanna thank to him. Also, he changed Scary movies "topic". From just scary movies to "general", so all people can watch it. You remember there were lots of tits in the 1 and 2. Not in 3 now. It's rated pg-13. That much, from R to PG-13, the plot is a lil bit "childish".Second, Like I said, the movie was a lil bit corny because of rating. Honestly, I wanted and was one of the person who was waiting for more tits in 3. When I knew that the movie was rated PG-13, I was like "I was disappointed to Zucker". Even though the movie wasn't like that, it gave me different sense of funny in 3 unlike 1 &amp; 2. Although it was good movie, it was just boring to me.. so much..The scary movie 3 will be one of the Zucker's best production like Naked Guns series. If you wanna know what naked guns are just look for it in IMDB...it's so funny.. I so recommend..to you guys..If scary movie 1 was all about teen/ horror/ teen horror genres like " I know what you did in last summer", and "Scream &amp; its sequel by Wayans", scary movie 3 is refreshed. They have "the ring", "The matrix, the matrix reloaded, "The lord of the ring", and "8 mile".In my word, Scary movie 3, it does not fulfill on any part of what its supposed to do or any promise it might have had. All it does is further dampen the reputation of a series and add stupidity to each scene while continually proving the series old, stale and worthless just like the horror genre its supposed to be spoofing. The blame is to be placed on Miramax who never seems to get it. They don't take hints and don't know when it's time to end the series. Even an opening scene with Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy in Catholic school girl uniforms with lesbian undertones couldn't save this movie. That's a sad, sad tale.But, I still recommend to watch it...IT IS STILL ONE OF THE SCARY MOVIE SERIES... IT IS...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Scary Movie 3" adds on to the "Scary Movie" insanity created by the Wayans brothers with their first movie in 2000. Like the two Scary Movies before it, "Scary Movie 3" is one great big spoof. It's main focuses are "The Ring" (2002) and "Signs" (2002). Other spoofs include "The Matrix" (in which the part of "Orpheus" is GREATLY downsized from the trailers), "The Others," almost every alien movie ever made, and a brief "Airplane" tribute.Although the movie is hilarious, there is something lacking. The Wayans brothers' choice not to participate in this third movie definitely leaves it without a certain zing watchers have come to expect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3 starts as two girls Becca (Pamela Anderson) &amp; Kate (Jenny McCarthy) discuss a videotape that supposedly kills you after one week, having watched the tape themselves a week ago they end up dead... TV news reporter Cindy Campbell (Anna Farris) is on the case, she is also investigating the appearance of strange crop circles in local corn fields. Could the two be linked somehow...Directed by David Zucker I thought this was the weakest of the first three Scary Movie comedy spoofs. The script by Pat Proft &amp; Craig Mazin seems to tone things down a lot as represented by the PG-13 rating in the US a lowly 15 rating here in the UK, gone are the gross sexual gags, the crude toilet humour &amp; jokes about the disabled that I personally think made Scary Movie 2 (2001) so funny &amp; politically incorrect. This one could be called slightly racist at times but otherwise it's quite tame stuff, it's still quite amusing at times &amp; does have it's funny moments including a funny bit involving Pamela Anderson at the start saying 'no, not that tape...' in an obvious reference to the sex tape she made with Tommy Lee &amp; one when a news reporters autocue is tampered with &amp; a disgruntled black janitor types in some funny stuff for him to say on air but overall I felt it's definitely lost it's edge &amp; the dialogue isn't that funny or quotable. As expected it spoofs many films in particular The Ring (2002), Signs (2002), The Sixth Sense (1998) &amp; The Matrix (1999). At only 80 odd minutes it moves along at a good pace &amp; it entertains if you switch your brain off if nothing else.This time around this one is changes it's principle production team, a different director &amp; writers from the previous two you can sense Zucker's influence for silly light hearted fun rather than bad taste humour just like his Naked Gun (1988 - 1994) films which are similar in tone. All I will say is if it ain't broke don't fix it. There are as many unsubtle homages, references &amp; spoofs of other films as you care to mention &amp; a merciless sending-up of Michael Jackson which I didn't find funny at all.I am amazed this cost a whopping $45,000,000 as it doesn't look like it, but then again what do I know. It's well made but nothing really stands out. There's a good cast here including Charlie Sheen, Denise Richards, Leslie Nielsen &amp; of course Simon Cowell makes a fun cameo appearance as seen in all the trailers for it.Scary Movie 3 is the weakest of the first three Scary Movie films, I haven't seen Scary Movie 4 (2006) &amp; Scary Movie 5 (2008) obviously isn't out yet. Worth a watch as it provides silly, dumb entertainment but where's all the filthy toilet humour &amp; crude sexual gags?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Zucker is good at spoofing movies. I have nothing against him. I loved all his earlier movies. But Scary Movie?? He shoulda left this one alone. The Wayans were doing such a good job. The only reason, people did not like the 2nd one is the same reason people did not like most of the sequels of successful movies. Its seldom better than the first one. Of course, we have exceptions like, T2 and Aliens. But they are very rare.Well, the reason I say David does not fit the profile is that, he got carried away with the spoofing and forgot all about giving the audience laughs. I mean, this is supposed to be a scary movie at the heart of it. What the heck are aliens doing in this movie? Now, the Wayans, they stuck to the laughs and after that the spoofs just followed. After watching Scary Movie 3, I was very disappointed. Instantly Scary Movie 2 got a rating of 8/10 from me. Just like Minority Report. That was the other way around. Many did not like Minority Report. Thats only 'cos they did not watch A.I. If they had they woulda loved Minority Report.Anyway, S M 3, does have its moments, especially Anna and the rapper/farmer. Really funny. Leslie had no idea what he was doing in the movie. Maybe that was the point. huh..I wonder, if they have a goofs section for this movie.You know, they coulda put in the goofs in the movie just 'cos they were being funny??!! hmmm...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary Movie 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did used to like the Scary Movie films in a rather immature way, now only the first film is the one I can say good things about, because as they go on the sequels get worse and worse, and the spin off films from the same makers, e.g. Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie and Vampires Suck are abysmal, this was the third film in the near pointless continuing horror films, television and popularised celebrity news spoof series. This film predominantly parodies the science-fiction and psychological horror films, specifically Signs and The Ring (remake of the Japanese film), as well as spoofing or referencing The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Sixth Sense, Minority Report, 8 Mile, American Idol, The Matrix, The Others, Living with Michael Jackson, Bruce Almighty, The Faculty, The Matrix Reloaded, Jeopardy!, Air Force One, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Airplane!, The Crying Game and Gothika. Basically the film opens with Katy (Jenny McCarthy) and Becka (Pamela Anderson) watching television and then talking about a cursed video tape, it apparently kills people seven days after watching it, and they experience paranormal events before both dying. It then moves to the farm of Tom Logan (Charlie Sheen) where large crop circles have been formed in the field and from above it is a large arrow with the words "ATTACK HERE", and Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) who has become a news reporter is looking to cover more of the story, but her boss wants more of her stories about sex and violence, and she also has to look after her paranormally endowed nephew Cody (Drew Mikuska). Tom's clumsy son George (Simon Rex) has a dream to be a star rapper, and with friends Mahalik (Anthony Anderson) and CJ (Kevin Hart) he enters a rap battle, with Cindy, as they are smitten with each other, and Cindy's reunited friend Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) watching, he has good talent, but he trips himself up again with a racist blunder. That night Cindy spends the evening with Brenda who wants company, and after telling her that she watched a cursed video tape a week ago and plays some pranks on her, she goes to the lounge for popcorn, and the television turns on with evil dead girl Tabitha (Marny Eng) climbing out and eventually killing her, and George tells his niece Sue (Jianna Ballard) in a very inappropriate way that her teacher is dead. Tom meets Sayaman (Ajay Naidu) who reminds him of the night he accidentally killed his wife Annie (Denise Richards, then Sheen's real wife), and after the chaotic wake of Brenda, where her body is blown up, Cindy finds the video tape that is cursed, and like the other victims she is called by the evil voice to say she will die in seven days, and to help the situation CJ suggests she visits Aunt Shaneequa aka The Oracle (Queen Latifah) and her husband Orpheus (Eddie Griffin) for answers. Having caught Cody watching the video she investigates lighthouses like on the video, and on the news she tries to warn viewers about the danger of the video tape, and following this the Logans come to the conclusion they are definitely being invaded by aliens, and it may have a connection to the video, and President of the United States, President Baxter Harris (Leslie Nielsen) knows that Cindy Campbell may know what to do. Visiting The Architect (George Carlin) he explains he is the father of dead girl Tabitha and the evil video imprinted her curse and it got out because of a mistake, and she then goes to the Logan farm where she finds Cody is hiding with the family to hide from the aliens coming to Earth. The aliens turn out to be good and are cursed themselves by the video, so they came to stop the evil, and Tabitha is defeated being pushed back down the well she drowned in by President Harris wishing the couple luck, and in the end Cindy and George are married, and Cody is hit by a car. Also starring Jeremy Piven as Ross Giggins, Darrell Hammond as Father Muldoon, Simon Cowell, Fat Joe, Master P, Macy Gray, Redman, Method Man, Raekwon, RZA and U-God. The film is only a little reminiscent of the classic spoof films, like Airplane! or The Naked Gun, and not just because director David Zucker is involved, the character stupidity is on a lighter level, the ridiculousness is amusing, the gross and disgusting material is thankfully not very high, Cindy is clumsy and accident prone in a less annoying way, as the only other returning character Brenda is alright as well, Sheen is a good choice having been in Hot Shots!, and Nielsen is of course likable as the heightened George W. Bush like President. You may recognise the films being parodied, but the jokes can be repetitive and predictable, the story is a bit more worked out, it is certainly more worthwhile than the previous film, the same sadly can't be said for one or two of the other sequels in the series, a disappointing but fair horror comedy spoof film. Okay!</fullReview>

There are some moderately humorous parts; the first 10 minutes with Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy are a 'hoot', but it goes straight downhill from there. The recurring '8 Mile' theme just doesn't work, and the so-called humor is just plain stupid. I loved the first 2 Scary Movies, but this one is a flat-out bust. I see Scary Movie 4 is scheduled for release in 2005, also directed by David Zucker. Big Mistake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Note: I originally wrote a 1200 word + review of SCARY MOVIE 3, trimmed it down to under 1,000 words, and posted it on IMDb to fit under their word maximum (which is 1,000 words). However it was never posted, so I've decided to merely write a shorter comment on the film and hope it is accepted. If you wish to read my original, full-length review, with in-depth analysis, visit movie-gurus.com.Although SCARY MOVIE 3 is a fairly funny film it is overpowered by long dry spots. Charlie Sheen looks tired and isn't given much to do, although he's rather good in the spoof genre. Leslie Nielsen -- why? Basically the only high point of the film is getting to stare at cutie Anna Faris for the majority of the running time as she spoofs THE RING, SIGNS and yes, even 8 MILE.All in all, worth a rental, but don't buy it or anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes you find on watching a film that all the best bits were in the trailer.In this film this was certainly the case, but... most of the trailer wasn't even in the film.So there were only 2 or 3 good gags in the whole thing.When you consider how many different films the film makers have taken their skits from, it is hard to believe that they could miss the mark with every single one of them.This could have been a sly take on recent films, instead it resembled something a 12 year old boy with a maturity problem cobbled together in 20 minutes for his Creative Writing homework.The audience when I saw it was mixed in sexes and ages. Only the little boys laughed. That, and that alone, should tell you how pitifully poor this film was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even a decent cast and crew can save an exhausted topic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The genre of parody is long dead...that's a simple but undeniable determination when you're looking at the nowadays movies like this Scary Movie 3. These kind of movies are supposed to be barrage of funny sequences and a variety of subtle and more explicit humour. Scary Movie 3 doesn't come much further than a few forced laughs. I guess fans of this kind of comedy have to face the fact that movies like Hot Shots! or The Naked Gun will never again be made. Not to mention the earlier work of maestro Mel Brooks ( Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein )...we'll never see new movies like that again. Nevertheless, Scary Movie 3 will become a huge success. It contains the names of stars who made this sub genre of cinema so popular. David Zucker, Leslie Nielsen, Charlie Sheen, Pat Proft...these people don't have to convince us anymore. Derived from their earlier work, we know they're talented, but they just can't make anything out of this exhausted franchise. The "jokes" are limited to the characters falling down and literally copying scenes from Signs, The Ring and 8 mile. Some of the sequences are so embarrassing and unfunny that I really wonder how on earth they made it till the final cut. And even though I know the structure and plot aren't important in this kind of movies, the attempt to give a little draught to the story is really pathetic. All the different storylines and characters are connected by extremely thin wires and, even for a parody, this is pretty low. Yet, there are a few positive aspect I should mention as well, though. Leading actress Ana Faris becomes a better actress ( and prettier ) in every episode. By the time they shoot Scary Movie 7, she'll be an adequate star. Other than that, Scary Movie contains a few amusing cameo's and smaller roles by decent actors ( Jeremy Piven, George Carlin ). And - last but not least - it was a great pleasure to see Charlie Sheen again on the big screen. Too bad it was in an inferior product, but still...most of his recent movies went straight to video and, as a fan, it was good to see him again. In conclusion...Don't expect a huge improvement over the previous two scary movies just because the Wayans brothers didn't direct. No matter how talented the cast is, none of them can save this movie from boredom and déj? vu feelings. Next !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I begin, I didn't go into this movie with a serious tone, I didn't go into it with high expectations. But despite both of those, I was disapointed.The film perhaps works in the sense of moderatly funny scences with a couple laugh out loud moments, but they don't come very often. Even as a spoof this movie doesn't have any direction, it manages to put Signs and The Ring completely combined as its major plot. Why not try a groovy idea of centering the spoof around one movie with minor gags associated to other flicks.However, with the lack of Wayans brothers involved in this movie there is a definete plus in the lack of dick and fart jokes predominantly featured in the first 2 movies. Dick and fart jokes can be effective in certain movies, mainly if not used as a transition.Yeah so back to Scary Movie 3. Dialogue is weak, even for a spoof the story is weak, acting is weak, gags are weak.Don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realize that Zucker movies are supposed to be absurd, but al least the first ?Airplane' and ?Police Squad' had organized plots and story lines. ?Scary Movie 3' was a disjointed unfunny joke. Over half the scenes in the movie left me confused and disappointed. It was almost the first movie that I walked out of early (years ago I rented ?The House of Cats' and ejected the tape from the top-loader VCR after about 20 minutes). Instead of playing it safe and leaving I punished myself by staying and waiting for the movie to get funny. It never did.Maybe the movie theater didn't run the opening reel of the film, as the version I saw was ONLY 75 MINUTES LONG. Even so I was worried when the rep from Dimension films that introduced the film said, `you are among the first people in Baltimore to see this film. If you like it tell your friends, if you don't maybe come see it again and give it another chance. Enjoy the film!' Yeah right. Who were they tying to fool? I want to know what the actors in this film were thinking. The producers must have either offered them a ton of money or only showed them their portions of the screenplay. The unconnected individual scenes were sometimes amusing but many of the movie rip-offs were wasted. There was so much potential, especially with the Matrix scenes, but the advance screening audience and I were left high and dry. Sight gags can only go so far to carry a movie and the ones in Scary Movie 3 were few, fleeting and spread too far apart.The scenes did nothing to advance the plot of the movie. You will quickly realize that when the first scene with Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy both starts and ends with no explanation that the whole film is going to follow the same disjointed pattern. Save your money. Save your time (even though you would only be wasting 75 minutes). Save your sanity. Save Yourself. Don't ever watch ?Scary Movie 3'.0 out of 100.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow.You know, the first "Scary Movie" was a decent enough movie. It wasn't anything special, but it was alright. "Scary Movie 2" basically sucked, but it had its moments. Now here's "Scary Movie 3". It sure had a funny trailer. Of course, everybody knows these kinds of movies always put the best stuff in the trailer, but it's still probably gonna be kinda funny, right?Let me just say that "Scary Movie 3" makes the first two look like "The Godfather" and "The Godfather II". This movie is so bad I wanted to get up and punch the screen.Let me save you the money and demonstrate what it does for 90 minutes of audience torture: "Hey! This part's like 'The Ring'! This part's like 'Signs'! This part's like '8 Mile'! This part's like 'The Matrix'!" That's it. We recognize parts of those other movies, but the writers apparently thought that was enough, because they do NOTHING with them.Oh wait, this is what it's ACTUALLY like: "Hey! This part's like 'Signs'! Except someone gets kicked in the crotch!". Sigh.Here's the (only) good stuff: the opening scene, with Jenny McCarthy and Pamela Anderson. There's about 3 good laughs in it. Then there's a throwaway gag about pop-up ads later on (that's actually the funniest part, but it's only about 3 seconds long).The only genuine redeeming quality, though, as in all 3 of the "Scary Movie" films, is Anna Faris. She's a gifted and charming actress, and I'm glad she's popping up in some quality films, like "May" and "Lost In Translation". Hopefully she'll still have a career long after "Scary Movie 3" is gathering dust in the dollar bin at the video store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you liked "Scary Movie" or the sequel "Scary Movie 2", you'll probably enjoy this somewhat lesser installment of the series. If you haven't seen SM or SM2, you should watch them in chronological order before spending time with SM3. Though SM3 lacks some of the serious slams of its predecessors, it still features Faris as the spacey airhead who's out to get to the bottom of the scariness while spoofing other scary and not-so-scary movies such as "8 Mile", "The Ring", "Signs", "Children of the Corn MDCVII", etc. Nielsen and Sheen work well while Anderson and the twins, McCarthy, and Rex pretty much suck with the rest of the cast somewhere in between. SM3 is typically inane, always busy, unabashedly silly, and nonstop nonsense not for the jaded or sophisticated comedy palate. (C+)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the Wayans brothers who made the first 2 movies were gone, so their heavy filthy comedy, and although this time the names who made it have David Zucker, Pat Proft, Leslie Nielsen, Charlie Sheen (Gents made many successful original parodies once) BUT despite anything this movie wasn't as good as their earlier work, not highly good in itself, only good compared to the first 2 Scary movies which were too dirty to scary extent for me ! "Non-impressive movies"So, what's here to be spoofed ? well, answering that would lead us to the movie's biggest problems. True that (The Ring) was a good choice that had good dealing, but they selected movies like (Sings) to be spoofed, utilizing its main plot as well. OK, to spoof a movie it must be whether so very well known as a classic hit or as a classic flop (as both ways all supposedly has seen it). The way (Airplane) had taught us while dealing with the Airport series of the 1970s. So (Sings) or (8 Miles) aren't classics, or left that classic effect. Even (8 Miles) and (The Matrix Reloaded) aren't scary movies originally for god's sakes ! Actually, it seems that the movie makers just looked for the box office hits of the year before to choose the movies that must be spoofed, and it's just a shame, I'll tell you why.."The easy parody" The spirit of parody isn't based on just fast slapstick out of a TV commercial, or any instant ridicule of some bit of a movie that maybe succeeded now and will be forgotten later. I believe the essence of the parody judges the real silliness of one movie, aiming at mocking at its own exaggerations, or making fun out of what turned, for one reason or another, into classic work adored by millions. It relays in its core on being a funny conscience more than a spoofing channel. Not to mention making good laughs around for the ones who maybe don't know the originals that were being parodied. But sorrowfully the things have been changed for worse in the last few years, where nearly nothing of the above was fulfilled, with only slight jokes more than memorable sketches, missing traits like the smart sight gags, being just imitations of SNL and poorly!. "Bad incoherence"After the Zucker, Zucker, Abrahams-era the plot for making a parody movie became a farce itself. Remember movies like (Naked Gun 33 1/3) where a character was on a mission, having a conflict, needing to reach something that was lost (in short : there was coherence). Then in (Scary Movie 3, 4) the matter became about toying with the recent box office hits without much of a plot. Eventually, in the most lousy Friedberg, Seltzer-era (Date, Epic, Disaster Movie) the whole thing came to a point where the spoofs are just about the summer movies' trailers more than the movies, and it reached to sneering at movies that weren't released yet !!! Plus being badly made like junk food as well. So, they transformed into just a hasty commercial game or a silly exploitation that need to be spoofed itself !Here, suddenly the character of the brother thinks about being afraid of making a family and why not to marry, that could've been smart point for a plot with possible meaning, but not this time. Why the new parody movies, even as a farce, had to be written so idiot like this ?! It mirrors a belittlement and laziness from its makers. "Extra problems"Its low budget is visible without dazzling scenes that could make it a "movie" more than TV work. (Charlie Sheen) was so frigid like someone who's wearing a mask. (Leslie Nielsen) looks out of shape and I just hated the material that was given to him. Even (Pamela Anderson) and (Jenny McCarthy) seemed old, so ugly, and so unfunny which tells about the level of the guest stars this time. Speaking of which, Fat Joe made fun of the retarded kids during his song ! I really think this comedy doesn't need to be offensive and more lame !There is a languid feel about it, and no respect for the viewers' mind. For instance ; (Ajay Naidu)'s car ? the one who parodied M. Night Shyamalan's cameo in Sings ? goes wrong toward what we know supposedly that it's (Sheen)'s house though no crash happens, or how Ja Rule who plays the president's sentinel got disappeared from the events at one point vaguely ! Or repeating very old stuff like Nielsen's line "I just wanna wish you good luck, we're all counting on you" from (Airplane), or "You're excited? Feel these nipples!" from Zucker's (BASEketball) which's not a good joke basically !.. To repeat the joke in a comedy is one fatal mistake, so how about weak comedy in the first place !The best about it was the yummy presence of (Anna Faris), she radiates in every moment, giving the movie something which's higher than it. And a few parts, like Simon Cowell cameo, or The Matrix spoof, or The Others spoof, yet on second thought, these very parts were all in the movie's trailer ! So if you give it a little thinking you'll discover easily that the real laughs can be gathered in just 2 minutes out of 84 minutes movie, and say what? They already did that !"The real crime"I couldn't remember did I laugh 3 or 4 times exactly ?! However, the thing I do remember is that (Scary Movie 3) is not a good comedy. It's really disappointing to watch a movie that's supposed to poke fun at maybe bad points in other movies to end up having many for itself, being not as clever or coherent as any of them. Simply, they took the unserious mission of it un-seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a honest movie because it's humor is directed for a teenager audience, and the PG-13 rating just confirms it.The humor is typical for a PG-13 movie; you have less sex jokes than in the previous Scary movies, and it also spoofs popular movies among teens like "8 Mile", "Signs", and "The Ring".The truth is that "Scary Movie 3" is mindless entertainment and should only be enjoyed by people who are in the mood for goofy humor or for fans of "The Ring" and the fore-mentioned movies.I found it to be silly and boring at some points, but okay for cheap laughs in the American way. Charlie Sheen was surprisingly good in his role. Anna Faris always delivers expectations and looks simply stunning. The rest of the cast is just regular and do not add anything special.Well, watch this sequel if you dig teen American humor. The whole 8 mile spoof was the best in my opinion.Not enough Horror spoofs; that's the main problem. It's supposed to be a "Scary Movie".</fullReview>

They weren't concerned about the quality of jokes, that is obvious. They were more concerned with how they could get more people in the movie and make lots of money. R Rated movies tend not to do as well as lower rated movies, so they made it a PG-13 rated movie and then they packed every celebrity that they could get regardless of whether or not they could find a way for their character to fit in the plot (Which by the way seems like they spent about 10 minutes writing). The movie is a mess. The movie has one of the dumbest endings I've ever seen.

		<shortDescription>Doesn't Quite Have It But There Are Still Some Pretty Funny Scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Scary Movies are still a bit of classic's in my book but they should have stopped after two. Scary Movie 3 just didn't seem to have the same freshness and fun that the first two did. The film is a spoof of recent horror films such as Signs (2002), The Ring (2002) and for some odd reason The Matrix trilogy. They should have stuck to the original, no name cast instead of working in Charlie Sheen, Pamela Anderson, and Denise Richards. Pretty much they're trying to connect an odd video tape that kills people with an alien invasion. Simon Rex's character George is completely idiotic and stupid. He has no funny lines and is just plain moronic. He reminded me of Kelso from that 70's Show but just dumber. Charlie Sheen isn't exactly your top comedy actor but he does have a few good scenes especially the flashback spoof of Signs. You'll have some good laughs, some scenes are a bit dry and others just stupid. It doesn't compare to the first two but comes close. The language is cut down and the sexuality is minor. The spoofs aren't bad but some are over-used and Rex's performance mar every scene.Scary Movie 3. Starring: Charlie Sheen, Anna Faris, Simon Rex :-(, Pamela Anderson, and Leslie Nielson.2 1/2 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, Scary Movie 1 hit theaters. I went to see it and it was the funniest spoof I had seen recently. It was fresh and different at the time and it was a product of the Wayans brothers. It was chuck full of vulgarity, racial jokes, and other types of dark comedy. Then came Scary Movie 2. I'm glad I didn't go see this in the movies cuz this one really sucked seriously. I wonder what the W-boys were thinking. The freshness was gone and...it was just a bad movie. And then with other spoofs like Not Another Teen Movie, I thought the spoofs were coming to an end cuz they started getting too stupid.Then came Scary Movie 3! This film was COMPLETELY different from the other two because its humor was a different type of humor. It bruoght back the atmosphere of the truly funny spoofs like AIRPLANE, the NAKED GUN trilogy, and HOT SHOTS. This movie is funny or not, depending on the type of comedy you like. I like comedy films that focus on smart, genuine, fresh humor rather than films that rely generally on sex, drug, and racial jokes. So that's why in my opinion, this one is the funniest of the three.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was soooo funny. It was much funnier than scary movie 1 and almost as funny as scary movie 2. I was laughing at every gag from the first scene to the last. I'm glad that david zucker (the genius who invented the genre with airplane) directed this movie because the wayan brothers are not very funny. gone are the crude sexual jokes and mean humor and instead we have laugh out load gags and funny spoofs of your favorite movies like 8mile, circles, rings, and the tape movie. I hope if they make another sequal it will have charlie sheen and david zucker in it also because they are a great team. If you enjoyed the movie airplane or the movie hot shots than do yourself a favor and GO SEE THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>can't even hope to lick the boots of earlier Zucker spoofs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Third in the series of "Scary Movie" films and the first without the Wayne brothers, and after the horrendous Scary Movie 2 perhaps that is a good thing. Instead David Zucker take the reigns. The results are better than SM2, but still pretty bad. I think i chuckled once or twice. Neither of those times was at anything Anna Faris said or did though. Anthony Anderson is pretty much wasted, that's a shame cause the cat CAN act pretty well (don't believe me? Catch any episode of him as Atwon Mitchell on "The Shield" especially the 90 minute episode #51 "Back in the Hole") And as for why I didn't get into the plot it's because it really doesn't matter in this movie.My Grade: D+ DVD Extras: Commentary by David Zucker, Robert Weiss, Craig Mazin, and Pat Proft; 10 awful deleted scenes; 23 minute Makin of; 5 minute making of parody; Bloopers; behind the scenes of the alternative ending; 3 Trailers for "the Osburnes" and a Dimension compilation trailer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without the Wayans Brothers, this movie just doesn't match up to the first two. Among other things, the lack of Marlon Wayans' character Shorty made it a lot less humorous than the first. Hopefully they'll learn from their mistake and bring back Shorty and Ray before trying to make another movie. What's even worse is they just ripped the characters out without even trying to explain why they left. The one part with Michael Jackson was slightly funny but the rest was horrid. It seemed less like a spoof of various horror films and more of a poor attempt to move it beyond. It was originally written to make fun of horror movies and should be kept that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary because it is so unfunny...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3 doesn't really have any relation to any of the other Scary Movie movies (except for two characters by same name only). There is some sort of plot trying to spoof both The Ring (the American version) and Signs, with a little bit of 8-Mile. After seeing the shorts of this - it looked like a bit of a return to form for the scary movies BUT when you watch it and realise that the funniest jokes (or should that be joke - singular?) were (or was) on the trailer!Apparently - the Wayans brothers who were responsible for the first two - were nowhere to be seen in this instalment and I think it shows. Gone is the crude sexual humour - replaced with a pretty tame and lame sort of spoof "Hots Shots" humour (slap stick, Naked Gun-esquire boob jokes, Leslie Neilson)...I think that the Ring was an OK choice for doing a spoof movie - although I don't think there is enough material to sustain a full length spoof movie (maybe a 2min sketch would suffice!). Also - Signs was a very weird choice for a spoof - the original movie (in my opinion) wasn't all that memorable - so why a spoof a few years later? The 8 Mile spoof was incredibly tedious!My opinion - do not go and see this film! It is terrible - even worse than Scary Movie 2 (which seems like high art compared to Scary Movie 3). Shocking stuff!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A total waste of time, the only laughter in the theatre came from the legions of 8-12 year olds that parents brought. This movie should have been released straight to video and given free with purchase of a roll of toilet paper as it is a complete piece of crap. In general had one scene remotely humorous (Queen Latifah fight scene), the rest was grasping at straws for bad jokes and gags. A complete disappointment as the previous two installments were funny, you would expect this one to be also. It is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute disaster just like the first two.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, my bitter disappointment by this time in the ridiculous Scary Movie saga is no surprise, and I have no one to blame but myself for going to the theaters to see it in the first place, and the only weak excuse I have is that I heard from someone that it was much better than the first two (really, could it possibly have been WORSE??) because it had a different director. So I figured that since it wasn't TOTALLY a production of the abysmal senses of humor of the Wayans brothers, I would give it a shot, and the only good thing that came of it was that I learned once and for all how important it is to consider a film's target audience before paying real money to sit in an entire theater full of them.So, that being said, if you're the kind of person that would really get a kick out of seeing an eight-year-old boy beaten repeatedly about the head, face, and body with a baseball bat, please, go see this movie. If it would really please you to see that same boy get hit by a car TWICE, you're sure to enjoy this idiotic mess of a film. If, on the other hand, you like to have the slightest speck of actual thought put into a film, you might want to avoid this one, or at least wait until it comes out of video so you don't have to surround yourself with the kinds of people who answered yes to the first two questions. Believe me, I surrounded myself with them a couple nights ago and wished the entire time that I had a pot to put over my head and a wooden spoon to hit it with. That would have been more enjoyable than the movie.When I write my IMDb reviews, I usually try to keep from getting too upset by how bad a movie is. After all, I'm the one that went to see it in the first place, right? And I don't believe in that `I want my money back' crap. Nowhere at any movie theater in the world does it say at the ticket booth `Satisfaction Guaranteed.' When you buy a movie ticket, you spent the money whether you liked the movie or not, that's not a hard concept to figure out. I have no problem with a movie being offensive. Quite the contrary, offensive movies tend to be the ones that are most remembered because they made an impression, even if it might have been a relatively bad one. Movies that make you a little bit uncomfortable are the ones that you notice, the ones that make a lasting difference. And I'm not only talking about massively important examples like Schindler's List or American History X or anything like that.Consider this, if every single movie was happy and fun like something like Indianan Jones or Toy Story or Back to the Future, movies would be pointless, they would be little more than pretty things to look at and something to make us laugh and to entertain us for an hour and a half. But when a movie makes us uncomfortable or is offensive to our beliefs or our way of life, maybe just because it shows us something that we don't normally or have never seen and probably don't WANT to see (like death), that's when they gain a new kind of power over us - the power to affect our view of the world. Unfortunately, obtaining this kind of constructive discomfort is not only difficult to capture, it is also VERY easy to screw up, especially when you, as the director/writer/etc, of the film clearly do not care about getting it right and/or do not understand the importance of getting it right.And this is not just true of dramatic war films or deadly serious films, it's also very true of the comedy and even the spoof comedy. The spoof comedy even more than the rest is expected to make fun of the movies that it spoofs and to do it RESPECTFULLY. Granted, some of the jokes in Scary Movie 3 are funny, some of the spoofs are done in relatively good taste (although, compared to the rest of the material, that's not saying much), and some of them I laughed out loud at. But where the Scary Movies go seriously and unforgivably wrong is that they do not understand when they have gone too far, when they've crossed the line, when they've crossed from being childishly amusing to being seriously offensive. And not the good kind of offensive either.I'm not just talking about jokes that are too gross or boobs that are almost popping out or too much profanity, I'm talking about the fact that there WILL be people seeing this movie who have had a brother or a cousin or a SON who has been killed by getting hit by a careless driver, and these people will have walked into this movie having no idea that they are going to see this happen onscreen and have to suffer through an entire theater-full of morons laughing their idiot heads off. Scary Movie 2 featured a character with a disfigured arm, and everyone groaned and yelled and said `Oh God gross!!!' when he ate mashed potatoes off his hand as though he were performing fellatio on it. Clearly, Mawn and Sharlon Wayans, or whatever their names are, have no idea that there are people like this in real life, who want to be able to go to the movies and have a good time just like everyone else.So like I said, I have no problem with movies being offensive. I encourage it. But it becomes a problem when the makers of the film have no idea about how the mechanics of offensive material work, and the Wayans brothers are clearly clueless. This is not something that's `all in good fun,' this is the absolute bottom of the scale of bad taste, stuff for which there is no place in mainstream entertainment. I hope that I've avoided offending anyone who enjoyed the movie by things I've said in this review. I support constructively offensive material in movie reviews just like I do in the movies, as I described above, and I do not try to offend anyone with what I say in my reviews.So that being said, honk if you love the Scary Movies. Then drive into a tree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you watch this you'll notice this. That the movie follows almost in the directors chair to that movie Signs and that it is almost as dumb as the others. The aliens, you can tell that they are in costume. The newscast, come on, now you have me. A news channel that features sick junk. That's just what this movie is. Junk, pure junk. The woman this time has blonde hair. The boy, you can tell he isn't enjoying the film, is hit numerous times with fans, cars, baseball bats and is kicked many times. Even the main plot don't make sense. If they make a sequel I can most definitely say it's going to be stupider than this one or it's sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When seeing this movie I was not expecting much. I liked the first 2 because of the vulgar humor and the sex/drugs jokes. I knew that this was rated PG-13 and was kind of upset because I knew that they wouldn't be in the movie. I heard it was funny from some of my friends but those friends never liked good movies. After I finished watching this movie I felt like I had lost some IQ points, it was probably the dumbest movie of all time and make Aiplane! seem like the history channel. I recommend not seeing this movie if you have any intelligence whatsoever.First off Charlie Sheen was in this movie so I really wasn't expecting much out of him since the last spoof he did Hot Shots: Part Deux. Anna Faris is a horrible actress as well as Pamela Anderson.The point I'm trying to make is that this was just extremely dumb, even if you have seen the movies they are spoofing. I don't think anyone should ever be tricked into viewing this disaster.</fullReview>
