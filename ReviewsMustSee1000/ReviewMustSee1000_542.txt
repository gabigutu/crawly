		<shortDescription>A great morale booster!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vietnam without a doubt was a dark period in our history.Any comedy film surrounding Vietnam would indeed have to be done delicately.This movie pulls it off.What amazes me most about the film is the flawless, improvisational radio dialog from Robin Williams.This,as most of you may know,was completely unscripted to allow Williams an opportunity to work his magic.Also,it had to be timely,for the movie is,of course,set in 1965.The fact that he was able to do this is nothing short of amazing.The supporting cast was also incredible,with great performances by Forrest Whitaker,Bruno Kirby,and the late J.T.Walsh as "Sergeant Major Dickerson",the man you love to hate.Although some of the horror that was Vietnam is here,it's only giving you a taste of it,as it concentrates more on the Williams character's quest to make our beloved soldiers forget their horror,at least for a while.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive Robin Williams film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There never has been, and probably never will be, another film which shows both sides of Williams to such a great degree.As the wise-cracking disc-jockey, Williams shows his undisputed wild comedic talent, but the bomb scene and scenes of rural Vietnam life, truly allow Williams to such his dramatic acting ability. They look at the conflict, without getting in too deep.A superb cast as well including Bruno Kirby and the late great J.T. Walsh gives a solid backdrop, and are beautiful foils to Williams.Overall, a wonderful movie, add it to your collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective movie that is neither too funny nor too grim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just sat through a DVD of this movie,the second(?)time I'd seen this film. The last time I could recall seeing this,it was on pay-per-view television in a hotel(the Red Lion I think it was) room,August of 1988,so my memories of this film could use a refreshing. I'm glad I got refreshed.In 1965,Airman Adrian Cronauer(Robin Williams,in the first of his four Academy Award nominations)is brought on to do an Armed Forces Radio stint in Vietnam. Behind the microphone,Cronauer lets loose,much to the surprise and delight of many of the troops and servicemen around the area of combat. His combination of off-the-wall humor,impressions,sound gags and quick wit,mixed with his love of free-wheeling Rock music of the era,is pretty much welcomed in the area,save for a few angry sorts: a Napoleon-complexed intermediate CO named Hauk(Bruno Kirby,unrecognizable but for the voice) and a stiff-lipped,quietly vindictive middle commander named Dickerson(J.T.Walsh,so good here it would seem like this typecast him). As this is going on,Cronauer becomes smitten with a local girl(Chinatra Sukapatra,spelling?)and befriends her brother(Tung Thanh Tran),which leads the popular DJ down a road of self-discovery.With excellent support from Forrest Whitaker(one of my favorites!he ends up sort of counter-balancing Williams' manic frenzy with nerdish normalcy as his buddy/assistant/guide),Richard Edson,Noble Winnigham,Robert Wuhl and Cu Ba Nguyen(as the oily GI bar proprietor)among others,this film,directed by Barry Levinson(whose work hasn't been this good in what feels like forever,certainly not since Avalon or Rain Man) and written by Mitch Markowitz,it is arguable one of the deftest films to create and maintain a balance between the horrors and inhumanity of war and the humor and pathos that are very much present in it. Robin Williams' fans may get much more out of this that those who aren't,but I think even many of those who don't consider themselves fanciers of his talents should be able to appreciate this. The images were powerful enough that they stuck with me some after the first time I saw GMV and after a second time I feel like can appreciate even more out of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams does his thing well in this comedy that makes us think. ***1/2 (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM / (1987) ***1/2 (out of four)By Blake French: Robin Williams is about as good as they come at doing stand up comedy, and in "Good Morning, Vietnam" director Berry Levinson gives him everything he needs to make the film go above and beyond the average satire. From his outgoing sense of humor, to his aggressive personality, and dozens of vocal effects, he portrays his character with interactive zest. Who can resist the awakening voice of Williams on the radio yelling "Good Morning Vietnam." This is a film that conquers the test of time. "Good Morning, Vietnam" tells the story of a lively disc jockey who gets a job on Armed Forced Radio during the Vietnam War. Robin Williams is the fast-talking Adrian Cronauer, and who better to play the part than he. Although this character is one-dimensional (we are never informed on his background, marital status, where he comes from, what he did before we meet), as the movie continues he gradually begins to change into a deeper, more meaningful person. The story moves along smoothly; the narrative through-line is consistent as each scene relates to the next. Although little momentum or suspense can be noticed, the film does have several underlining themes, often viewed upon in a Stanley Kubrick style: sarcastic and uncompromising. We see how much a little humor and jazz can greatly enlighten the hard-core atmosphere of the military during Vietnam, and how it can thoroughly confuse the bleeding heart officials.  The film hangs by the skin of its teeth for active conflict tension. Beyond people objecting to the actions of Williams' character, there is just not a lot of tension within the story, and at some points my interest wandered. "Good Morning, Vietnam" is merely a portrait of Robin Williams releasing his perennial comedy, and unfortunately that does happen to get old quite quickly; the majority of an audience can only watch the humor for so long until it becomes old and somewhat stale. "Good Morning, Vietnam" is definitely not a flawless film, but we do empathize for the main character, the scenes effectively capture the attitude and mood during the war, and the dialogue and writing feel accurate and involving. Barry Levinson has directed a marvelous comedy, one that is not all about making us laugh, but also makes us think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Good Morning, Vietnam" is truly Robin Williams at his best. As anarchic DJ Adrian Cronauer in 1965 Saigon, he makes sure that you never stop laughing. I really liked what he did with the tape of Richard Nixon's speech, and then his comment about the bombing of a restaurant. Most amazing is that he ad-libbed the whole thing (but hey, that's Robin Williams). Maybe Cronauer wasn't that wacky in real life, but every one of Williams' comments makes the movie worthwhile. The soundtrack even includes his monologues (you'll go crazy over the imitation of Lyndon Johnson, and the commentary from "Roosevelt E. Roosevelt"). A comedy classic in every sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me be perfectly frank and say right away that I watched this to experience Robin Williams at his best. That guy has so much comedic talent, it's unreal. I mostly got what I expected from this movie... but I found that it also contained some truths about the Vietnam war. The movie has plenty to offer on both fronts. Any fan of Williams' comedy will definitely enjoy it, and I think most war-movie buffs will too... if they can keep an open mind, and accept a slightly different approach to the genre. The way the seriousness of war is underplayed for most of the film really works to enhance the effect of it when it is shoved right in our faces, when we are forced to acknowledge it. We forget how serious and all-consuming war is, just like Adrian had(not necessarily the real one, I know nothing of him except of what the film told me, and as far as I understand, that's not that accurate a portrayal of him), only to be confronted with it. More effective than several big war movies. The plot is very good. The pacing is great, the movie keeps moving pretty much all through the film. The characters are well-written and credible. The acting is good pretty much all-round, and Williams proves once again that he can do drama just as well as comedy. The humor is typical Robin Williams. A very good film, and an unusual war movie. I recommend this to fans of Robin Williams and war movies. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really smart and somewhat humbling film that entertains and amuses.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made at a time when films on the Vietnam war were being produced by America at a healthy rate, Good Morning, Vietnam comes across as the sort that falls into both 'types' that were being produced at the time. Platoon got under the skin of Vietnam, telling the events from an individual's perspective through voiceovers without relying on a lot of causality, rather the everyday tasks and events that occur. Full Metal Jacket was an interesting beast in the sense most of its more intense scenes didn't actually happen in Vietnam but rather at home on the training ground. But both were in a sensible tradition and took attention away from the Reaganism inspired 'action' films that were Rambo: First Blood Part II and the like.Good Morning, Vietnam falls into both these sorts of Vietnam war films. On one hand it is a serious film about the war and deals with serious issues such as morale and how dangerous conflict with the enemy actually is without doing what Rambo did by turning the war genre into a sub-division of the action genre. At one point in the film, DJ and lead character of the film Adrian Cronauer (Williams) finds himself in a hostile area out in the jungle and you do feel the shift in atmosphere the film briefly moves into in the sense this guy is not a soldier but he is in a dangerous position and he isn't equipped with how to get through it. There is another scene in which a street side bomb goes off and Adrian is caught up in the middle of it, further reminding us of the war zone and cleverly shifting the aura.But the film does fall into the genre of comedy and while it does so, it never distracts us from the fact this is taking place during a war unlike First Blood: Part II which could really have been an action film set amongst any backdrop. Good Morning, Vietnam does not ignore its comedy roots either and gives us genuinely entertaining disc jockey rants from Williams who shines with his animation and ad-libbing, further reminding us of a later film of his, Aladdin, and how he really was the star of that piece.The best parts of Good Morning, Vietnam actually raise issues to do with oppositional reading. As a character, Adrian is one of those charismatic individuals who is perhaps more focused on entertaining his audience first but when repercussions to do with that want to entertain arise, it is an oppositional reading to something that seems innocent enough. There are a couple of scenes and incidences that deal with this theme of oppositional reading. One that springs to mind takes place in a bar in which Adrian has brought a Vietnamese friend whom he teaches in an English class. The trouble is, it's a G.I. bar and certain soldiers have an issue with the Vietnamese person being there. It is Adrian's carefree and relaxed attitude to letting the individual come with him to the bar that has upset certain others around him, resulting in an oppositional opinion on whether the Vietnamese person should be allowed there. One says he can, others say he can't and conflict erupts.This battle is constantly going on within the boundaries of the radio studio and exists between Adrian and the censors who blank out all the bad news such as deaths and bombings, failing to deliver the real news, and instead keep morale from going below a certain point. Adrian's style of giving the people what they should hear in a charismatic style also rubs off spawning a sub-story revolving around a small school that teaches Vietnamese people the English language. Before hand, they were learning very basic words and phrases but after Adrian takes over, New York City slang or 'jargon' is the name of the game and while you wouldn't find English as a foreign language classes doing this sort of thing, Adrian brings his charismatic style to a class, turning it from formal to informal.The theme here is that he's giving them exactly what he feels they need to know, not what the curriculum demand they know. It is the same with the radio station and the news censorship; giving people what they have a right to know vs. what a higher power say they should know. The principal foil for Adrian is Lt. Steven Hauk (Kirby) who is against Adrian's style of parody and constant joking but when he is put on air, the best he can do is adopt the voice and role of a Frenchman as he mocks and plods his way through airtime. It is a battle that the oppositional readers loose since morale falls drastically after Adrian is taken off and he is forced to be reinstated because of this.Good Morning, Vietnam carries a pumping soundtrack which is what you'd expect for a film about a DJ and an emphasis on radio and its constant referencing to popular culture, gliding from The Wizard of Oz to Eleanor Roosevelt makes Williams' scenes consistently fun to watch. But other than this, it gives some political stances without ever feeling forced with the 'Wonderful World' montage over wartime action and juxtaposes James Brown's music over other scenes of wartime action. The film is a success in comedy and drama, a rarity of sorts given Dr. Strangelove supposedly set the standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goooooooooooooooooooood Morning Preston Sturges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It finally hit me when I watched Good Morning Vietnam what this film reminded me of. It was the famous Preston Sturges classic, Sullivan's Travels which coincidentally as it turns out is one of my favorite films.Both the real life Adrian Cronauer and Joel McCrea's fictional John L. Sullivan have to come to the same realization, that what they do matters a great deal. In Sullivan's Travels it's to the movie going public in general, in the case of Cronauer it's to the GIs in Vietnam stuck in a war where no one could ever know who the enemy was. A few laughs from a comic genius was necessary to get them through the day in their very cockeyed world.Adrian Cronauer was a real life person, but if he didn't bear a resemblance to Robin Williams, he should have. One of the great comic masters of any era in entertainment, Robin Williams is given full range for his zany sense of humor to work its magic with Cronauer. He's ably abetted and assisted by the other staff members of Armed Forces Radio Forest Whitaker and Robert Wuhl. Bruno Kirby is great as the clueless lieutenant in charge and so is J.T. Walsh who represents the limits of the military mind as the sergeant major out to get Williams by hook or very dirty crook.Williams himself doesn't understand the complexities of the Vietnam situation. That fact is brought home to him graphically when he's betrayed by his own innate decency.Next to Williams my favorite in the cast is Noble Willingham who plays the general who has overall charge of Armed Forces Radio there. He's a tough, but compassionate military man, the exact opposite of J.T. Walsh whom he has to reign in.Good Morning Vietnam is a frank portrayal of a war experience told with humor and irony through the eyes of Robin Williams.Preston Sturges would have absolutely adored this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best--Williams behind the mic--is 11 stars, but the movie as a whole is a kind of slick formula otherwise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Morning, Vietnam (1987)A lighthearted but deadly serious anti-war film, actually. This is of course a Robin Williams movie so that it is his schtick, brilliant and inspired, that makes it soar. The best of it, including the famous riff when he first gets on the air as the new Saigon DJ, is hilarious and breathtaking. There is a plot, sort of, as he goes through a rise and fall at the military radio station, but it's more about his shining moments behind the microphone than anything else.The "else" in this movie is, however, most of the movie. That is, Williams has a serious role as an offbeat renegade in a chaotic world surrounded by a range of sensible and very insensible officers and colleagues. At the most extreme, when we see a Vietnamese village firebombed while Louis Armstrong sings "It's a Wonderful World," the sentiment is so cloying it makes you cry, and you're not sure why because you know it's just over the top manipulation. Likewise when Williams is caught in a traffic jam with other military vehicles and he warms up the soldiers by humanizing everyone and making them feel like they really should be back home. Which they should be, as we know in retrospect.So the movie has another side that's kind of sentimental and simplistic, whatever its good pacifist intentions. Williams is a decent actor?I'm not one of those who thinks he's brilliant outside of his funny roles?and so it holds up pretty well. But the plot line keeps the movie from really finding pathos, or comedy, or warmth, or tragedy of a dramatic kind, in the scenes outside the radio station. And I think that's what it intended.For those who don't know, it's worth adding that the main character, Adrian Cronauer, was a real person, and still is?he's a staunch Republican (Williams was not, to be sure) and an innovator in radio in Vietnam. He also co-wrote the screenplay, I assume working on the scenes that he would know best rather than the larger saccharine plot aspects. A great story, and the real Cronauer deserves credit for inspiring it, and helping it along. He was, along with most of us, "Godsmacked" when he heard the news of Williams's death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"And if you dooooooo..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a while since I've seen Good Morning Vietnam but I was reminded of it with the untimely death of Bruno Kirby earlier this week of August 2006. While the film is clearly Robin William's vehicle, Kirby, playing 2nd Lt. Hauck, is the perfect comedic foil. Kirby plays the uptight Hauck, who can't wait to get his hands on the microphone, in way that brings many of the laughs and sets Robin Williams up for more. I continue to use his line "and if you doooooo..." when someone, e.g. my wife or children, do not seem to be listening to me intently enough. Kirby does this in a scene where he is giving instructions to his underlings, who are routinely ignoring him as they comment on things having nothing to do with his agenda. This is a great movie. Williams gives one of his best performances, and you already know how I feel about Bruno Kirby. Another newcomer in the cast is Forest Whitaker, who would later make his mark in The Crying Game and as the host of the update TV series "The Twilight Zone."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect showcase for Robin Williams' unique improv</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Morning, Vietnam is undoubtedly the film that propelled Robin Williams to the A-list. Beforehand he was only known as Mork from Ork, and the films he'd been asked to appear in (except perhaps Moscow on the Hudson) were ones not really giving him an opportunity to flex his true muscles as an actor.But GMV changed all that, because it was the first time Williams had been given a character that finally allowed him to showcase his unique brand of improv. In this case, a DJ.Its what Williams does with the part that makes GMV so compelling. His live-wire performance transforms the entire movie. Without Williams, GMV would be a considerably lesser film than it is.Barry Levinson's film is rather unique because it was the first (and only) one to add a bit of comedy into the Vietnam War. Taking a leaf out of MASH's book, it uses the conflict in Saigon as a backdrop for William's barnstorming impressions and impersonations. And for the most part, its a sweet package.Williams plays Adrian Cronauer, a funny man shipped to Saigon to be the new host of a morning radio show. Adrian's irreverent antics in front of the mike raises a few eyebrows among the straight-arrow US military, but the troops love him!All the while, Adrian gets to know Vietnamese culture up close and personal. Something that leads to romance, friendship and eventually a betrayal that changes Adrian's life forever.It was the decision to put Robin Williams at the centre that makes Good Morning, Vietnam such a great movie. Williams is a master of improvisation. He can slip from one impersonation to the next effortlessly. And the best part is, none of it is scripted. Williams improvises routines right out of thin air. You know he's just making this up as he's going along, and its a remarkable thing to see.Levinson knows Williams needs no script or cue cards to work from. All he does is position the camera in front of Williams behind the mike, give him the line Good Morning, Vietnam and then go from there. And its like watching a comic whirlwind. Any scene with him on his radio show provides non-stop laughs. He has seldom been better in anything else.What I also liked about GMV is its humorous approach to the misguided Vietnam conflict. Its when it tries to be a little more serious and dramatic that the film falls down. Yes the war in Vietnam was a terrible tragedy. Especially because it represented the American's sabre-rattling mentality at its narrowest. But the dramatic elements offer nothing particularly enlightening about the war. The comedy elements however do.When Good Morning, Vietnam is funny its very funny. But when it tries to make serious points it slows the film right down. Its Williams irreverent commentaries on the conflict that give the film its life. Even when he's doing impressions of Richard Nixon and even Elmer Fudd there's a thinly disguised veil of contempt against the US military's participation in the Vietnam War. They're wrapped up in sharply satirical comic material, but they make more of an impact than the film's outright heavy-handed approach. Subtlety makes all the difference.Robin Williams is the heart and soul of the entire picture of course. Whether he's delivering manic rapid-fire monologues on the air to teaching native Vietnamese the hip aspects of the English language, he holds the attention whenever he's around. He was deservedly nominated for an Oscar. An Oscar he should have won really.Levinson surrounds Williams with talented character actors. The most engaging are Forest Whitaker and Noble Willingham. Whitaker plays Edward, a timid young man who learns to loosen up after spending time in Adrian's company. And Willingham plays Gen. Taylor, the only one among the top brass who takes a shine to Adrian's unorthodox methods. He brings depth to what could have been an easily clichéd character.On the downside, JT Walsh plays exactly the type of character Willingham is so skillful at avoiding. A pompous, self-important bureaucrat who takes an instant dislike to Adrian's free-thinking spirit. I have to admit I found it a bit hard to swallow that Walsh's character Sgt Major Dickerson (tee-hee!) would actually try to get Adrian killed in VC territory. No matter how much he hated him. His is an unnecessary character really. The film could have done just as well, and arguably better without him.Nethertheless, the ending is still quite sad when Adrian winds up being shipped back to the US because one of his Vietnamese friends is a terrorist. Williams performance is so faultless that even when you can see the mechanicals of the plot clicking into place, you still feel sadness for him. His closing message is the perfect blend of cutting humour and acute pathos.Good Morning, Vietnam would have been better if it had stayed true to the comic route. But despite a few bumps in the screenplay, Robin Williams' quite excellent (even virtuoso) performance keeps things remarkably on course. He made a questionable detour into sentimental schmaltz in the following 90s, but this film shows you what Robin Williams can be capable of when given the right material to work with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect combination of comedy and drama by Barry Levinson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) is a DJ from the official radio of the army of the United States, who is sent to Saigon with a mission to revitalize the utterances of that station, in charge of informing and entertaining the troops in the War of Vietnam during 1965. The arrival of the station Cronauer is a balm for the American fighters, who see the new radio announcer gives a completely different from its predecessors boring, which merely provide music and information in a soporific tone style. Sympathetic and witty utterances Cronauer, whose assistant to a shy soldier played by a negligible Forest Whitaker, like the troops but not the lieutenant Houk, strict defender of political correctness that will be a hard obstacle to the charlatan DJs from the same day of their arrival at the station. In no way is "Good morning, Vietnam" a war film (a single cartridge, despite a handful of scenes action is triggered), and the public can find something like a criticism of the Puritan and formally shown the American Army in a delicate situation, to the distance between commanders and troops. Certainly a film one expects much more, so original idea but fun and avoid the war topic almost diametrically. A good comedy directed by Barry Levinson ("Rain Man", and "Wag the Dog") who knows how to use the powers of Robin Williams and Forest Whitaker to offer a film in which coexist perfectly comedy and drama, and meets the challenge to turn misfortune into something not fun, but if less tragic.</fullReview>

He is brought into a military radio station to do morning shows, and atracts an incredible amout of fans and listeners. The troops in the field love him, with all his hilarious antics and with him playing the greats in music. But the brass can't stand him and are willing to do anything to get him thrown out of the job. The humor is real enjoyable for everyone young and old.

		<fullReview>This movie is silly and childish, but there is so much good thanks to Williams and a bit of cleverness by Levinson to keep things more than interesting. Why couldn't Weir have been as inventive with 'Dead Poets Society'?This is your only spoiler warning...In comedies, characters learn nothing because often they are stereotypes with nothing to offer.In war movies, the characters learn one lesson: war is hell. This follows two hours of fireballs, bullets, blood, and noise.Here we have a twofold take on war. There is the blunt and obvious as depicted in the Armstrong montage (copied by Peter Jackson in 'Return of the King') where the hard lessons are taught through suffering. This is the weaker message of the two.Then there is the message of what wartime and big, bad evil censorship does to creativity. Williams is once again a rebel and better than his all-too-predictable role in 'Society'. See this and you'll never need to see another Weir or Levinson again.Overall, not only is 'Good Morning, Vietnam' funny, but it is worth your time as an alternative take on a subject nearly beaten to death. Perhaps the best war movie of the 80s.Final Analysis = = Learn from this...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depends On How Much You Liked Robin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:This is one of the easiest movies for me to review for you. I grew up with Robin when he first started out on Happy Days, then Mork and Mindy; I always found him quite funny. His humor is not for everyone, this is his movie. Barry Levinson tiptoes about the minefield of Vietnam, quite carefully, but it really is just background here to a man trying to cheer up the troops with his zany humor. I have heard from people, who were in Vietnam, that Cronauer was nothing like this. When I review a historical movie, I predicate my evaluation on the entertainment value of the film. He made me laugh, and often, especially when the jokes came at Nixon's expense. The scene where he splices cuts of Nixon's speech with very embarrassing questions is worth at least one viewing, it is some of his best work. Cronauer's nemesis in the movie is Sgt. Major Dickerson, a very apropos name, played by the legendary J.T. Walsh, who adds to the value of the movie. Dickerson detests Cronauer and makes his destruction his personal mission in life. Also, we have the great Forrest Whitaker, as Garlick, when he was just starting out as an actor. The movie is stolen by clueless Bruno Kirby, as a brain-dead lieutenant, who considers himself a great comedian, he is the only one, trust me. Yes, Adrian does get drawn into the mess when he chases after a young Vietnemese girl whose brother is secretly VC.The movie starts very light, as it progresses, it gets more and more serious. The comedy of the movie derives greatly from Adrian's monologues on the radio. Those of you familiar with William's comedy routines know he is famous for flying off on tangents into impersonations and wacky parodies of television and movies. This is what makes it easy for me. Did you hate him in Insomnia where Nolan had him firmly under control? If yes, do not watch this movie, you will detest it. Frankly, the Vietnam War is all background here, yes, there is an explosion at a bar with carnage. His girlfriend's brother gets him out right before detonation. He does confront the VC brother for getting him thrown out of Vietnam, at the very end, but truly, the star of the movie is Williams and his comedy act. There is a very suspenseful scene, where it darkens, Dickerson is not above trying to get Cronauer killed by sending him into VC held territory hoping they kill him. Again, the brother magically appears to save Adrian. These occurrences catch Dickerson's eye and he gets the general to fire him for 'collaberating' with the enemy. The scene, at the very end, where the VC brother says all the horrible things America is doing to his country is about as political as this ever gets. Also, the news is highly censored; Adrian, after the explosion at the bar, snaps and reads the headlines before they were screened. The movie really is a story of how he got kicked out of Vietnam, despite being beloved by the GI's. Dickerson is more to blame for what happens to him; for me, I like his humor though many, understandably, do not. If you didn't grow up with him, he can seem too wacky. Levinson, unlike Nolan in Insomnia, lets Robin run wild here; you can tell that the broadcasts are unscripted where Williams is doing what he always did best: improvisation. As a young comic, this is how he became famous. He used to have people yell topics at him like tennis balls which he just ran with. For those of you looking for a penetrating look at Vietnam, like Apocalypse Now, don't watch this, it is not that movie. Levinson does make some points about the horrors of the war but everything is background to Cronauer's radio show and his war with Dickerson and Bruno Kirby.I will be honest with you, this is not my favorite of Levinson's Avalon, or The Natural. It is borderline for me, better than Diner, certainly, but a long way from Rain Man. I hope this was of help to you, my friends. Q.E.D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams Rocks the Airwaves!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams stars as Adrian Cronauer, an Air Force Dee-jay who has been brought to Vietnam to be on the airwaves there, ostensibly because he was funny when he was a Dee-jay in Crete. There is a real Adrian Cronauer, and this story is based on him, but the marketers never advertise this as based on a true story, so you know this must be mostly Hollywood at work.Cronauer's style is unique, wild, wacky, crazy, with tons of voice impressions and just off-the-wall stories and personalities streaming out of the head of Williams/Cronhauer into the ears of the troops. It's a huge departure from the typically monotone, boring, and heavily censored radio entertainment, and the troops love it!Forrest Whitaker also stars as Ed Garlick, a fellow radio Dee-jay and kind of the mentor to Cronauer. Once Cronauer gets settled, the story centers around two themes: 1\ his battle against the uptight stations owners, played beautifully by J.T. Walsh (See Breakdown - great bad guy) as the Sgt Major and Bruno Kirby as Lt. Haulk who desperately wants to be funny, and believes he is, but no, he's just not. And 2\ his attraction to a young Vietnamese woman he sees passing on the street, Trinh (played by Chintara Sukapatana who went on to become an actress with some credits). Cronauer develops a friendship with Trinh's brother Tranh, and Cronauer slowly realizes that the cultural division between him and Tranh is wide and probably insurmountable. Barry Levinson directs this masterpiece, with excellent taut movement from scene to scene - not much wasted moments here. See Rainman and The Natural from some of his other gems.In the end, what happens is pretty much what you might expect, but it doesn't make it less heartfelt an emotional pull for the viewer. I wouldn't describe this as an anti-war film, but more so, as a film that encourages you to question the status quo as you go through life, which is certainly what Cronauer did, in spades. Enjoy this fine film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams' breakthrough movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's the best thing about the movie "Good morning, Vietnam"? In my opinion it's the fact that it offers a whole new approach to the war in Vietnam. That's why it's an important part of the war movie history although it clearly isn't a war movie in a traditional way. I've never seen it as the greatest Robin Williams movie. "The Fisher king" is much more stylish and clever than this one, "Awakenings" is more touching, "Dead poets society" more profound, hell, even "Mrs. Doubtfire" is at least funnier than this.For some strange reason, 16 years later "Good morning, Vietnam" looks a bit dated. I'm definitely not trying to say this is a bad movie because it will always be one of the most important films of a great actor and a fantastic comedian Robin Williams (of course lot to do with the fact that many consider this as his official breakthrough in movies). But it's not as funny as it's meant to be and I'm pretty sure it tries to make a some sort of a statement but I really can't figure out what. Still, reasonably fine film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Morning Vietnam is a masterpiece. It's funny, but at the same time shows the war from the eyes of our protagonist Airman First Class Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams). Cronauer is a military DJ sent to tell jokes and report the news in Vietnam. But as soon as he starts his superiors Lieutenant Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Sergeant Major Phillip Dickerson (JT Walsh) are angered at Cronauer's unorthodox music and off-color jokes. But the movie's best parts are the scenes where Cronauer does his job as a DJ. It's really funny. This is one of Williams's best performances. The acting from everyone else is also really good. Good Morning Vietnam is really just a great classic Williams comedy.</fullReview>

With possibly the best soundtrack, second to that of The Big Chill's, Good Morning Vietnam also shows the absurdity of war, especially the Vietnam War, and the bizarre schedule and corruption of the U.S. Army and their agendas. Brutally captivating and hilariously funny, Good Morning Vietnam will get some giggling but most will be in hysterics. Gorgeous film made with such passion and love. Whilst some of the elements may be tediously unnecessary, the majority of the film is a fantastic Comedy Drama which will have your eyes glued to the screen and your stomach in stitches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The other side of the Vietnam War ? decent but overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in late 1987 when Vietnam films were popular, "Good Morning, Vietnam" chronicles the real-life story of Airman Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) as a DJ in Saigon, 1965. While Cronauer is a hit with the troops he incurs the wrath of his superiors for what they consider irreverent and subversive tendencies. When he's off the air Cronauer pursues a cute Vietnamese woman (Chintara Sukapatana) while befriending her brother (Tung Thanh Tran). Forest Whitaker plays Cronauer's friend at the station while J.T. Walsh and Bruno Kirby play his nemeses.While categorized as a war comedy, "Good Morning, Vietnam" is more of a war drama with amusing touches, simply due to Williams' antics. The film was a box office hit when it was released and hailed by critics. Roger Ebert, for instance, gave it a perfect rating. I didn't see it until a couple of nights ago ? 27 years after its release ? far removed from the hoopla of the period, and found it decent at best, although somewhat amusing. An example of the film's limitations can be seen when Cronauer performs in the presence of the troops in the second half; the sequence is somehow unconvincing. Nevertheless, there's an unexpected twist in the third act that piqued my interest and the movie is a necessary companion-piece to films like 1986's "Platoon" in that it provides the non-grunt, political side of the infamous conflict.The film runs 121 minutes and was shot in Thailand.GRADE: B-</fullReview>

With no real good or bad side, it's hard to decipher strangers' true colours. Regardless of warfare, Mr. Cronauer simply tries to remind people of their humanity. To remind them of better times. To remind them of the laughs and joy any person can share with another.Truly understanding both sides is the greatest battle. Bringing to light the truth that is too often silenced and progressing together instead of dominating is a solution rarely sought. Remember that war is seldom fought by the ones who actually started it. To stop it is imperative. To endure it is even harder. Nonetheless, Adrian Cronauer tries.</fullReview>

Despite some far-fetched moments, this is loosely based on the events experienced by Adrian Cronauer. With screenwriter Markowitz using historical inaccuracies to strengthen the emotions and laughs, one would think a main character would be given more obstacles to overcome? but everything ends up falling conveniently into place for our hero in this outing.**?

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams as The Perpetual Pierrot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fast-talking, wise-cracking, unorthodox radio DJ (Robin Williams) is sent to Vietnam in the days leading up to war. Here he learns life lessons, shares witticisms, mingles with the locals, and experiences the horrors that war in all its forms wreaks upon the world. An engaging premise for a film, and one which in the case is handled with great skill and care.I think, however, the thing that sets this aside from the multitude of other Vietnam war films or any other films that use humour to throw brutality into sharp relief is that this really is not a story about war. No, it is a film about a comedian's place in the world.Williams plays the perpetual Pierrot: laughed at and joking so that he feels like a real life human being. When our protagonist steps off the plane into the sweltering powder-keg of sixties Vietnam he is closed to the viewer. His japes and jokes are merely a way to justify his own useless existence. He breaks the rules of military radio not to prove a point, but to win the acceptance of his irritated comrades at arms.But, the death of friends and the turmoil of terrorism open him up to us for the frail and hollow man that he is, but this hollowness is what makes him such a complex and rich character. His stillness and sadness pierces to the very core of what is is to be a joker in the face of world of trouble, and it is not a pretty sight. He is now justified by a sense of purpose and the sense that others might rely on him rather than the shallow acknowledgment of one's own existence given by others, and this is where the real tensions take place.This deconstruction of the comedian and this insight into the defences we put up to ward of a savage reality is, in my opinion, what makes this one of the finest Robin Williams films to have been made. We, the audience, laugh not merely because Williams' patter amuses us, but because like him we would rather not subject ourselves to the ugly truth.Aside from soul-searching, however, this film has the added bonus of being beautifully constructed. The sixties soundtrack is woven expertly in through brilliantly shot panoramas and vistas, the editing is seamless and engaging, and no actor leaves room for doubt in the story. Forest Whitaker in particular is notable for his subtle performance of the nervous boy who grows into a confidant man, and Noble Willingham's gentle General is a nice touch in smoothing over the rough bumps of military complexity that might have otherwise arisen from this story.Really, my only issue with this film is, try as I might, I can't ever seem to find as much humour as is intended in William's quick-fire rambles. I mean, there is the occasional gem of shining wit ("women in comfortable shoes" gave me a good chuckle), but mostly his quirky voices and manic ranting slide right past my funny-bone without giving it the slightest twinge. This gripe, however, pales in comparison to the purpose that his comedy serves. As I said before, he doesn't need to be funny he just needs to make the jokes so we don't pay attention to what's happening all around us.So, in conclusion I've got to say that Good Morning Vietnam is a very good film indeed. It lets the viewer float through without much demand, but on a slightly closer inspection it reveals a wealth of intentionally glossed over depth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and fascinating movie about a frenetic Disc Jockey during Vietnam War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unorthodox DJ begins to shake up things when he is assigned to the US Armed Services Radio station in Vietnam ; it is based on real life Adrian Cronauer . An impulsive new Disc Jockey named Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams), on whom story was based , is shipped from Crete to Vietnam to bring humor to Armed Forces Radio. The irreverent radio man turns the studio on its ear and becomes wildly popular with the soldiers , realizing uproarious monologues but runs afoul of the middle management (J.T. Walsh , Bruno Kirby ,Robert Wuhl) who think he isn't G.I. enough . D J brings rock 'n' roll to troops during that period when the Vietnam War matured from its origins into a full-blown war as he briefly ruled Saigon's Armed Forces Radio in 1965 . While Adrian is off the air accompanied by his aide-de-camp (Forest Whitaker) attempts to meet Vietnamese especially women , and results to have brushes with the actual war that never appears on the radio.It's a stunning and absorbing story that is based on real events and historical deeds . The storyline tackles issues of ethics and morality and the horror war . The movie in spite of the passed time is still powerful and astounding. The film is a Robin Williams recital as he realizes a splendid portrayal of a frantic disc jockey as he plays , sings , stooges, tongue twister and pulls faces and grimaces . It's a farce with the master comic pretty amusing and with several wonderful songs from the 60s . Robin copped a first rate acting , achieved a lot of success and a well-earned nomination for best main actor . Williams' improvisational manic monologues are the spotlights and carry the film in an interesting story which meanders too much . Ideal main cast is completed by phenomenal secondary actors as J.T. Walsh , Robert Wuhl, Noble Willingham and also shines Bruno Kirby as jealous superior. Marvelous musical score by the classic Alex North -Cleopatra,Spartacus- , including relevant musical interludes . Coloristic cinematography by Peter Sova , the outdoors filmed in Thailand are spellbound and breathtaking . The motion picture is compellingly directed by Barry Levinson -Sleepers, Bugsy, Avalon- . This is a highly amusing and frequently funny War/drama/comedy romp with a witty script specifically aimed an adult audience . Picture is a vehicle Robin Williams , he's the whole show , he's an outrageous comic and real Farceur. If you like Robin's crazy interpretation , you will most definitely enjoy this one . Well worth watching for enjoyable performances from main cast as well as the warfare buffs who also will like it . Rating : Very good , worthwhile watching and better than average .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insightful and intelligent view on the early days of Vietnam also acts as the perfect Robin Williams vehicle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A big hit when it came out in 1987, "Good Morning Vietnam" follows the five month stay of Adrian Cronauer (Williams), a wildly enigmatic radio dj who's brought to Vietnam to start the 6:00 time slot in the morning. What the Army gets is far more than what they expected. Cronauer mocks everything about Vietnam and the world, making up headlines, imitating soldiers, and inserting plenty of blunt and fast humor. While the soldiers on duty appreciate this, his higher lieutenants are displeased by his outlandishness.The film works twofold. The first, and most obvious attribute, is the humor. Robin Williams is truly on a roll here, making up and firing jokes as fast as he can. I had to turn on closed captioning so I could understand them all, but once I did, I appreciated his humor far more. It also helped that I knew some history from the time period, so I could understand more of the jokes. You'll want to have an appreciation for his kind of humor here; Barry Levinson lets his radio broadcasts (and, at one point, his sudden one man show for numerous truckloads of soldiers) go on for quite some time.The second, and not so obvious attribute, is that this movie is also a very smart insight into the early days of the Vietnam war. We see news headlines printed about how the number of soldiers being sent to Vietnam are increasingly rapidly. Terrorist bombings start occurring in Saigon, traumatizing Adrian to the point of where he can't do his broadcasts. The Vietnamese are also portrayed very well here, with some shown as being appreciative of the American presence, some as skeptical, and some more with both feelings.And just as Robin Williams is shown as a funnyman, he is also shown as a more down-to-earth person. It's interesting to watch the progression of his character, as we learn more and more that he uses humor as a wall of sorts to block him from the bitter truths of life. Though he never admits it, we know it saddens him that the people who are listening to his show are doomed to a worsening conflict. There is a bitter irony when he hear his final broadcast and he says "I've got the lottery ticket out of here!" This really is the perfect Robin Williams vehicle, because we get to see him both as a comedian and as a "regular guy" (although, admittedly, it's kind of hard for him to be a "regular guy" when he's so famous among the fellow soldiers). And the screenplay is smart too. The comedy makes it watchable, and the historical and political insight makes it memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The harrowing tour of Viet-Nam is a chapter in a man's life which is something he will not soon forget. Having survived it, one wonders why the U.S. military tried so hard to deny they were ever involved. Having been stationed there, we did as this movie so aptly portrays, listened to the Armed Forces radio while in the field. The film is called " Good Morning Viet-Nam " and is purported to be the story of Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) the Disc-jockey who was transferred from the isle of Create to serve in Viet-Nam. Once there, the exuberant and happy-go-lucky DJ, becomes the troops' favorite, boosting moral and actively seeking feminine company. It is this later activity which brings Cronauer into direct conflict with Sgt. Major Dickerson (the late, J. T. Walsh) a no-nonsense, strait lace serviceman with no sense of humor. Although the disc-jockey disrupts the military radio station playing rock and roll music and ad-libbing comical sketches of various political figures, which upsets Lt. Steven Haul (Bruno Kirby) it is his after-hours activities with Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana) his girlfriend and Tuan (Tung Thanh Tran) her brother which produces sobering consequences and tragic results. Were it not for Gen. Taylor (Noble Willingham) his military patron, his stay would have been disastrous. Forest Whitaker and Robert Wuhl round out the fine cast and liven the radio setting. For Robin Williams, this movie is at the top of his impressive repertoire and is sure to become a Classic for his fans. Highly recommended as a collector's item. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, satirical comedy that does for Vietnam what "M*A*S*H*" did for Korea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Good Morning, Vietnam" forms part of what may be called the cinema's Second Vietnam Cycle. The first came in the late Seventies, immediately after the war itself, with films such as "The Deerhunter", "Coming Home" and "Apocalypse Now". Hollywood then seemed to lose interest in the subject for a few years, but returned to it in the late eighties when there were a number of major Vietnam War films such as "Full Metal Jacket", "Hamburger Hill", "Casualties of War" and Oliver Stone's trilogy of "Platoon", "Born on the Fourth of July" and "Heaven and Earth".All those other films take a deeply serious look at the war, but "Good Morning, Vietnam" is often regarded as a comedy, albeit a dark, satirical one. It essentially does for Vietnam what "M*A*S*H*" did for Korea. The film is set in 1965, and is loosely based upon the experiences of Adrian Cronauer, a DJ with American Forces Radio, during the Vietnam War. (The title comes from his habit of beginning every broadcast with an exuberant shout of "Gooood Moooorning, Vietnaaam!") The real Cronauer is a conservative Republican, but Robin Williams plays him here as a rebel against authority, although he is a rebel who, initially, has some support from the Army's top brass. It's the bottom brass who can't stand him. He is brought to Vietnam by a General who admired his broadcasts to American forces based in Crete. Cronauer, whose shows combine music with quickfire satirical comedy, proves immensely popular with the troops, but alienates his commanding officer, Lieutenant Hauk. Hauk dislikes his style of humour and the fact that he plays rock and roll instead of the likes of Mantovani, Perry Como and Andy Williams. Cronauer also makes an enemy of his immediate superior Sergeant Major Dickerson, who finds him insubordinate.As Roger Ebert has pointed out, the character of Cronauer undergoes considerable development in the course of the film as he begins to learn more about the war and about Vietnam itself. (That is, Vietnam the country as opposed to Vietnam the American foreign policy blunder). At first his irreverent humour is merely satire for satire's sake, but as time goes on it takes on a more questioning and more political tone. A key moment comes when Cronauer witnesses the bombing by the Vietcong of a Saigon bar which causes the death of a number of GIs. He wants to make reference to this incident in one of his broadcasts, but is prevented from doing so by Dickerson, who takes the view that if something is not "official" news it never happened. (Cronauer's situation is similar to that of Matthew Modine's Private Joker in "Full Metal Jacket", another film from the same year. Joker is a journalist on a military newspaper who becomes frustrated with his job, which he sees as dishonest, slanted reporting for propaganda purposes).Despite earning the enmity of Hauk and Dickerson, Cronauer is for a time protected by his patron General Taylor, who regards his broadcasts as being good for the men's morale. Cronauer's downfall eventually comes when he befriends a young Vietnamese man named Tuan, who turns out to be a Vietcong supporter. Even the General can no longer protect him, and Cronauer is discharged from the armed forces.Robin Williams started his career as a stand-up comedian, so he was a natural for the role of Cronauer. I have always regarded "Dead Poets' Society" as Williams' best film, but "Good Morning, Vietnam" is a strong candidate for his next best, along with "Mrs Doubtfire" and "One Hour Photo". It brought him a well-earned Oscar nomination, although he lost out to Michael Douglas in "Wall Street". Williams also receives excellent support from Forest Whitaker as Cronauer's friend Edward Garlick, Tung Thanh Tran as Tuan and J.T. Walsh as the arrogant bully Dickerson.There are some very amusing scenes, such as Cronauer's spoof Richard Nixon interview, and the one where he is teaching a class of Vietnamese students how to swear in English. There are also some brilliant lines; most of these are given to Cronauer ("No, we can't say "dyke" on the air, we can't even say "lesbian" anymore, it's "women in comfortable shoes"), but some of the other characters join in. (" I wouldn't buy an apple from the son of a bitch and I consider him a good, close, personal friend"- General Taylor on Nixon). Even the normally humourless Dickerson gets to utter the memorable threat "You better not even come within range of anything that happens or your ass is grass, and I'm a lawn mower". "Good Morning, Vietnam" is, in places, a very funny film, but it is also one that raises some serious issues about the war. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is Robin Williams at the top of his game in comedy. Robin was huge back in the eighties when he was doing his brand of hyperactive, hyper-referencing schtick in his stand-up act, but it doesn't seem to make the transition to film all that well, except in a few cases (this is one, another would be Disney's Aladin). The problem with other movies is they let Robin do his thing where it really has no place in the story. In this case, it IS the story so it works quite well.I like Robin when he does good movies, like this one for example. I can just imagine all the G.I.'s getting stoned and listening to him on the radio ("This dude is so funny! Hey, is someone shooting at us?"). There are a lot of laugh out loud funny moments in this flick. His act wears thin a few times, but over all it's great stuff. Bruno Kirby provides a lot of laughs too as the anti-Robin of the radio.Director Levinson has had an incredible career. Seems he's always doing something interesting, it's refreshing to watch a guy at work where box office isn't a concern, he just puts them out and you like them or you don't. This one starts out with big laughs, tells a sweet story about Robin's character and his relationship with the locals, and ends on a more serious note actually dealing with with the war and its effect on average citizens. Not Apocalypse Now or Platoon serious, but it's well done for a comedy. Worth seeing if you haven't already. 8/10 stars. G'night!</fullReview>

Robin Williams is given free rein to express his considerable talents, delivering a master class in comic improvisation. A performance which he has sadly failed to better since.The screenplay and soundtrack is drenched in period detail, complemented by some crisp photography which brings into sharp focus a city hovering on the brink of civil war.For my money "Good Morning Vietnam" must surely figure as one of the most intelligent and well balanced movies to emerge from Hollywood. Nothing comes closer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This might be one of Robin Williams best comedy films that I have ever seen. Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Williams plays a radio host Adrian Cronauer who hosts the local radio station for the troops of the Vietnam war. He starts off becoming a really popular voice to hear and some people recognise him. After a little while however he starts using jokes that the Sergeants do not approve of, e.g. using Presidential voice footage. All the scenes with Robin Williams doing his excellent impressions of famous people are extraordinary. But the funniest scene for me is him talking to voice footage from the President to help with his jokes about his private life. Also starring Forest Whitaker as Pfc. Edward Montesque Garlick and Robert Wuhl as Sgt. Marty Lee Dreiwitz. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Sound. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 31 on The 100 Greatest War Films, and it was number 100 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!</fullReview>

I suppose I struggle a little with him in much the same way as Americans struggle with many British comics. He was undoubtedly a very gifted, genuinely funny man and when I succeeded in following his very fast repartee, I can laugh along with the best of them. But sometimes, his delivery is fast, and so 'American' that I just can't follow what he is saying, so most of his clever humour goes over my head. I do remember once watching him being interviewed on UK's Michael Parkinson chat show, some years ago and he was utterly hilarious and took the whole show over with his brilliant antics and 'one liners'. Maybe he slowed down his delivery a bit for us slow-witted Brits. He is also no slouch as a movie actor and has a string of successful hits to his name. I was never a great fan of Mrs. Doubtfire but I thought his performance in Dead Poets Society was truly inspirational.I like Williams a lot in Good Morning Vietnam and his wacky, spontaneous sense of humour was absolutely perfect for the role of the irreverent, entertaining DJ who was shipped over to Saigon to shake things up at the armed services radio station. The movie is based on the true experiences of a DJ who was sent there during the early days of the war, and he states that the story is about 40% accurate ? but which 40%? Of course, we will never know. I still had problems with Williams' rapid-fire delivery and 'one-liners', when he was broadcasting 'on air' and sometimes I was lucky if I caught one joke in five of his deliveries. But that didn't matter, as he was in character and was playing the part of this crazy, funny DJ and I have no doubt that the GI's had no problems in understanding what he was saying.Interestingly, like The Deer Hunter, the entire Vietnam sequences (which are prevalent throughout the movie) were all shot in Thailand. I had not realized this until I read the closing credits, although I should have known something was amiss - the traffic was all driving on the left-hand side, whereas in Vietnam they drive on the right?. The Deer Hunter did not really deal with the Vietnam war as such, but merely used the war as a background to show the effects the war had on a group of blue-collar workers from America's hinterland. 'Good Morning Vietnam' on the other hand, was clearly an anti-war, anti-military bullshit-bureaucracy, where tin-pot, ignorant, myopic officers abused the power they had over their fellow soldiers. We can make some allowances for a certain degree of dramatic licence in the interest of a good story. But even so, the background to the movie was totally believable and certainly provided an interesting insight into how seeds were being sown, which would eventually lead to America's greatest military disaster. When the Williams character arrived in Saigon in 1965, the conflict in Vietnam was regarded as a local little skirmish, but by the time he was thrown out of the country, it had already developed into a full-scale war, even though news of the daily bombings in Saigon by Viet Cong terrorists and the general war escalation was kept from the local radio airwaves.Ironically, along with many other milestones, the Vietnam War eventually became the first war where the world could watch the 'action' from the front lines as they ate their dinner at home every night. It was the first time that unimpeded access was granted to journalists and TV crews.'Good Morning Vietnam' is funny, entertaining, sad and thought- provoking in equal measures. Enough time has now passed for the viewer to resist the urge to become too judgmental about the 'villains' of the piece' ? the US military; but nevertheless, it remains an interesting film which helps us to understand why America's 'Dunkirk' will probably remain part of their psyche for many years to come. If you haven't yet seen it, I recommend you give it a go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie knows what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin with the fact that I believe that this is a good movie. The soundtrack is fitting, the cinematography is generally well done, and the script, for the most part, is believable and well thought out. There are, however, some issues that take me out of my immersion in the movie. For example, the speech given by Tuan at the end of the movie was cheesy and forced. This is where I see that the movie understands what it is. The movie points out the needless presence of the military in Vietnam and that's the point of the move. Between the constant censorship and the multiple references to the distrust between the Americans and Vietnamese, the movie plainly shows the message that the Vietnam war was pointless and hurt relations with Vietnam. This does set up one great scene that I feel was the best in the movie. The montage of Tuan's friends getting captured and shot while Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonder World" was a beautifully shot scene that perfectly summed up what the director wanted to show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is based on the true story of an US Air Force man transferred from Crete to Vietnam in 1965 to be the new DJ of the US Army radio station, and when he goes on the air for the first time, he refuses to follow the dull format of the previous DJ or play the dull music that had been played. In the movie, the new DJ is in fact encouraged by his fellow enlisted soldiers to play contemporary pop music from Motown and The Beach Boys and engage in rapid-fire comedy patter. Various military people all laugh at the new DJ's verbal antics, but as might be expected, the military higher-ups are not pleased with the new DJ's irreverent program.A good potential idea, but poorly utilized. Robin Williams' routine was reportedly ad-libbed, but his comedy routine failed to be funny. The soldiers are all shown laughing, but one gets the idea that they do so because that is what they were hired to do. Rapid-fire comedy and silly verbal antics can be hilarious, but Williams was simply dull and boring, as if he wasn't sure exactly what he was supposed to do. I didn't bother to finish the film; what I saw of it shouted that it was going to be standard and clichéd, and what good is it to watch a comedian who is not funny?I wonder what the real-life DJ was like. He certainly must have been funnier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on Airman Adrian Cronauer, of 'Good Morning Viet-Nam' fame.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a special meaning for me, I was a 20-yr-old college student in Air Force R.O.T.C. in 1965, we all knew of the Vietnam war, most of us were starting to think about what it would be like to go. I ended up not going, but many of my friends did, and those who returned were changed by the experience. Seeing this movie and the scenes, although not filmed in Vietnam, bring back those memories.In one of his defining roles Robin Williams was Adrian Cronauer, an Airman who was a radio disk jockey for the military, coming into Vietnam from Crete. On his first day he starts his 6AM radio show with his now famous 'Good morning viet-nam.' This is actually accurate. And a few other things are accurate, but as Cronauer says that if he had done all the things depicted in the movie he would still be in Leavenworth prison (in 2008, when he said that). But what is realistic is that the radio personalities were supposed to help keep up the spirit of the GIs, many who had never left home before and were now in this very foreign place. So hearing some American humor and music would help take their minds off where they actually were.For me the most memorable part of this movie is when Louis Armstrong's rendition of "A Wonderful World" was playing while the film clips showed fighting, destruction, and killing. That is the political message of this movie.Forest Whitaker was also great as what became Adrian's sidekick (at least in the movie) as Edward Garlick, and who would take over the spot after Adrian was drummed out for misbehavior. In reality he was not drummed out, he followed his orders, and served his full one year there.So the movie is mostly fictitious in the way Adrian was depicted but is is more entertaining than it would have been if they had simply shot it in documentary style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts weird and cult-y, turns dark and more emotional than I ever wanted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review that I'm going to write seriously so be gentle. I am known as the the guy who will try to like everything and thank the lord, this movie is one of them. I saw the cast and the "pop culture" quotes such as "You are more desperate need of a blow-job than any white man in America" and figured it would be a good watch. It starts of sort of...boring? I guess is the best way to put it. Robin Williams, god rest his soul, was talking too fast as usual and nothing really stuck. Things really started to stick when he met Tuan, a young Vietmanese fellow who he would endure much with. Much of the story involves this boy, and I won't spoil everything but the movie really struck a cord with me when Williams character was saved by Tuan when Jimmy Wah's bar was bombed. Seeing Wah absolutely crushed, confused, and angry was a startling change from the happy, go-lucky Jimmy we've seen. The undertones of racism and America's true influence on the Vietmanese moral really hit too. It became incredibly powerful, and more than I bargained for, but still retaining the humour RW always promises in his movies. Forest Whitaker was a delight, being the meek, by the book US army guy, turned into a man who really grew into his role of doing things the morally right way as opposed to regulation. I find this movie misses a bit on plot in the first half which is the only reason I'm giving it a 7. If the start really ripped into the true horror Of Vietnam, like what was demonstrated when "Oh What A Wonderful Life" wailed in the background while we were subjected to violence and horror in the foreground. More of those types of moments early on would have helped set the underlying and foreshadowing, but the shift from RW slapstick to "Oh shoot I'm really in deep now" was truly remarkableI'm the guy who will try to like everything and this is one of those movies that I do like.Thank you for your time and stay tuned for more reviews from this somewhat cranky and meta-cognitive guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A role tailor-made for Robin Williams, and a decent war movie to boot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Good Morning, Vietnam" is one of Robin Williams' best movies and was one of the first to really showcase his improvisational abilities. However, it's not just a comedy and in fact, the tone of the picture is more serious than you might think going in. While Robin Williams does get to let loose in several hilarious scenes as Air Force DJ Adrian Cronauer, there is an undercurrent of seriousness which seeks to examine the effect of the Vietnam War on Vietnamese citizens, as well as what the US troops endured. It's not particularly graphic, but it didn't really need to be. Up to the time this film was released there were several highly acclaimed films on the subject already. What sets this one apart is the character of Adrian Cronauer, who uses comedy to lighten the spirits of the men serving their country overseas. Still, the film isn't without its flaws. There is a romantic subplot that seemed shoehorned in just to give the film some extra conflict. Also, by virtue of coming later, none of the messages the film tries to get across were that original either. Still, it's worth seeing this movie for Robin Williams' performance alone. Forrest Whitaker also gives a good supporting turn as Cronauer's Army buddy/escort. Another outstanding part of this film was the soundtrack, full of great 1960's tunes. There is also a moving sequence set to Louis Armstong's "What a Wonderful World." On historical accuracy, apparently not all of the events in the film happened as described and some were surely invented for dramatic purposes. However, that doesn't really hurt the film too much. Is this Robin Williams' absolute best film? No, but considering what came immediately before, this collaboration with Barry Levinson (who he would team up with a couple more times in his career) was a step in the right direction. Just kick back, relax and take in the comic genius that was Robin Williams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throughout his whole career, Robin Williams was known as the guy who could carry a film simply by being a part of it. Good Morning, Vietnam is once again an example of this extreme talent. Not all of Williams' films were great, and as was the case with Dead Poets Society, when you break down Good Morning, Vietnam to the basics, it's simply a story about a raunchy radio DJ pissing off his superiors. The story isn't very deep and there isn't much to go out aside from an out of this world performance by the late Robin Williams. In this film, Williams portrays armed forced radio DJ, Adrian Cronauer, who in 1965, took a job with the Army as a radio host. In the 60s there was no satellite radio or TV at the touch of a button, so stations like this were the mens only connection to home. Most of the time these stations played soothing music and gave the news, but Cronauer gave the men something they desperately needed, some humor in an otherwise terrible situation. He was definitely one of the first shock jocks to ever hit the airwaves and Williams portrayal was absolutely terrific. Much of the radio bits featured in the films were never written in any script, as Williams simply went up to the microphone and did what he does. The rest of the story is unfortunately not as interesting, featuring Cronauer befriending the local populations and falling for a young Vietnamese woman. Good Morning, Vietnam is another one of Williams films that you must see simply because it was one of the best performances ever recorded on film. In all honesty, without Williams, this film would have fallen flat on it's face. This is why, films like this would pay Williams to come in and do his thing, because he took films like this one from ordinary to extraordinary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Williams is brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barry Levinson's Good Morning, Vietnam is arguably his best film work since Rain Man (1988). The movie tells the story of Adrian Cronauer (played by Robin Williams) a wisecracking disc jockey in which some of his superiors really dislike his humor especially 2nd Lieutenant Steven Hauk (played by Bruno Kirby), but however most of his fellow officers do completely enjoy his humor (including me while watching this film). One thing that completely surprised me was the fact that this movie was inspired by a true story, as well as the fact that Williams ad-libbed those lines that the real life Adrian Cronauer mentioned during his time as an Sir force disc jockey. During the course of the film Williams meets a Vietnamese girl that he has a huge crush on and then follows her to her school and wants to teach the class that she is in.The movie also has a great supporting cast which includes Forest Whitaker as one of Cronauer's friend Edward a man he meets during his assignment,Noble Willingham as his commanding General,and as well as the two characters I hate and love at the same time Bruno Kirby as Steven Hauk a Colonel who is very full of himself, and J.T. Walsh as Sergent Major Dickerson a soldier who really hates Cronauer the most out of all the characters in the movie. The ending to this movie really touched me because how the Vietnamese girl who he had a crush on as well as her being one of his temporary students really didn't want him to leave the country, I would have felt the same way too if I was in the same platoon as Cronauer was in real life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Definitive Robin Williams Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Morning Vietnam is quite simply the greatest movie Robin Williams ever made (I know Mrs Doubtfire has a lot of fans, but I think this is the essential Williams movie) Plot In A Paragraph: In 1965 An unorthodox DJ (A brilliant Robin Williams) begins to shake things up when he is assigned to the Armed Services Radio Station in Vietnam. I can't praise the cast highly enough here, Forest Witaker, Bruno Kirby, JT Walsh, Robert Wuhl, Noble Willingham are all superb, as is Tung Thanh Tran and Chintara Sukapatana as some local people Williams befriends.The soundtrack is a great asset to the movie, featuring The Beach Boys and James Brown to name a few and Louis Armstrong's "What A Wonderful World" is an absolute show stopper! But it's Williams who is the star of the movie and he handled the emotional scenes just as well as the comedy scenes. Williams was rightly nominated for an Oscar for this movie, sadly he lost out to Michael Douglas as Gordon Geko in Wall Street. Superb direction. Superb performances. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let it be known that Robin Williams is a multi-faceted talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Morning, Vietnam has the uncanny ability to surprise. At around the hour mark, I was convinced that the film, while funny and impossibly kinetic and energetic in tone and performance, was solely sticking to this act of energy, while maybe touching but not capitalizing at the apparent possibility of an emotional subplot. Sure enough, director Barry Levinson and writer Mitch Markowitz manage to work in a seriously believable and touching bout of sentimentality to a picture so manic one doubts that it could possibly fit comfortably inside of it. The film is the perfect blend of manic, disposable energy and tender drama that it becomes a film to seriously commend in many different departments.Robin Williams is at the film's core as Airman Second Class Adrian Cronauer, who arrives in 1965 Saigon to work as a DJ for the Armed Forces Radio Station. He meets and takes a liking to the straight-laced and genial Private First Class Edward Montesquieu Garlick (Forest Whitaker), who also takes a liking to Cronauer after seeing what the man can do with a microphone and a broadcasting signal. Cronauer's radio broadcast, contrary from the archetypal and uninspired transmissions the bases were used to hearing, are irreverent and fun, with lively bursts of energy and unpredictable wit coming directly from the mind of its radio DJ. This leads him to be immensely controversial with his peers. However, Cronauer becomes supported and rejoiced by his students who attend his English language learning class on a frequent basis, proving that while he does things differently, the man has the incredibly ability to connect and to inspire.It should be dually noted that Williams exercised the practice of improvisation while performing his wild-and-out radio shows in Good Morning, Vietnam, for it shows extreme comic energy, timing, and capability. Williams indefatigably, zealously delivers monologues of true power during his radio shows, zipping by with unprecedented comedic speeds, with jokes so sneaky and quick that you're bound to miss at least a few. His character Cronauer doesn't even a cohost for his radio show, as he is the sole provider of such indescribable energy and fun in the film.Furthermore, Williams works to illustrate Markowitz' more sentimental and emotional second half, which isn't as emotionally manipulating as one would expect. Rather than carelessly paint a second half so somberly, immediately following a goofy but thoroughly enjoyable first half, Markowitz carefully constructs scenarios and characters for us to latch onto as likable souls victim to a senseless, brutal war. After an hour of Williams' rampant comedic delivery, despite it being incredibly enjoyable, I was expecting the entire film to only vaguely come to an emotional or even dramatically investing second half. As Markowitz goes on, however, he totally creates a wonderful climax and conclusion to the film.In addition, let it be known that Williams works tirelessly to detail the emotions necessary for the film to succeed. He transitions ever-so naturally from manic energy to humble and sentimental, effectively but commendably illustrating a drastic divide in emotions so beautifully. The performance at hand rightfully earned him an Oscar nod and affirmed a potentially skeptical audience of Williams' incredible on-screen energy.Starring: Robin Williams and Forest Whitaker. Directed by: Barry Levinson.</fullReview>

It is very light-hearted and it isn't complex at all as all the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated many falsehoods. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose. A true gem in which the only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the desperately needy relationship between the characters.

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams At His Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Morning, Vietnam is often a funny and witty movie thanks to the fast-speaking talent of Robin Williams. Williams delivered his lines at his usual rapid pace and that makes things all the funnier. But in order to effectively deliver the material, he needed a great screenplay and that's what he got. It delivers the goods and some of the lines are just funny. My favorite is when the film lambasts Richard Nixon. I was in hysterics.Barry Levinson directs a film about the fast-talking radio host named Adrian Cronauer who is sent to Saigon to be the funny on-air personality everyone is raving about. The brass may dislike him for his on-air antics, but he has gained the ears of the common soldier.This is the perfect role for Robin Williams. His approach to comedy is perfect for this role. Some people may find this annoying, but I was laughing very hard throughout. He's at best when he was on-air. His off-air scenes were good, but they were more considered melodrama than comedy.Overall, Good Morning, Vietnam is a very funny film thanks to the presence of Robin Williams. This can also be considered a war film, but it's a rather unusual take on war film. But with Vietnam still fresh on many people minds at this point, this was a good way to tell the story: with comedy. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Williams is at his best in this movie which has to b e the perfect movie for him to do. He won an Oscar eventually for the worked he did on Good Will Hunting as a best supporting actor but I didn't like that movie so I pretend he got the award for his acting in this movie instead. I think this is his best acting and also his best over all movie (maybe this shared with Dead Poets Society). He plays an army radio DJ who goes to Vietnam to entertain the troops because he is so fun and well liked. His show ends up being a hit but he rubs all his superiors the wrong way by making fun of them and Richard Nixon and doing funny characters on the air as well as breaking all kinds of rules.I won't spoil the ending but if you haven't seen this check it out because it's a very funny movie but also can be very touching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Robin Williams' Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find Robin Williams frustrating as an actor. He can be both very funny and he can pull off dramatic roles well. For such a versatile actor, though, he often ends up taking the parts he plays a little too over the top and can sometimes distract from the story. "Good Morning, Vietnam" was a very good performance by Williams, though, which allowed him to display both his comedic and dramatic talents.Williams played military DJ Adrian Cronauer, who hosted an Armed Forces Radio show out of Saigon in the mid 1960's during the Vietnam War. Cronauer was an innovative DJ, trying to make military radio sound more like civilian radio back home. The military, however, is very steeped in tradition, and Cronauer's efforts weren't universally appreciated by the military brass, with whom he often butted heads.Williams did a good job as Cronauer the DJ. In fact, you could say that he was tailor made for the part. Having said that, the real life Cronauer acknowledges that he wasn't as over the top as Williams portrayed him. So the movie isn't a biography; it was made for entertainment purposes. I suspect that much of the dramatic content of the movie was fictional. It revolved around a Vietnamese woman who became Cronauer's love interest and her brother, who became Cronauer's best friend until he was discovered to have been a Viet Cong member.This is, perhaps surprisingly, a reflective movie at times, giving the opportunity for the viewer to think about the Vietnam War through a number of scenes. It's definitely one of Robin Williams' best performances, and he's supported by actors such as J.T. Walsh and Forest Whittaker. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Barry Levinson takes a more comedic take on the Vietnam war like other great war comedies such as MASH. Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) is the new DJ in a stiff Armed Forces Radio. Edward Garlick (Forest Whitaker) is his best friend and Lt. Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) is the humorless superior. Adrian's life gets more complicated as he falls for a Vietnamese girl and befriends her brother.Robin Williams is doing his crazed manic persona. He lets his mouth run wild. Some of it work great. Some of the humor is era sensitive. How funny is a Lady Bird Johnson joke today? But how funny was it back in the 80s? Luckily, there is a story behind the crazy wise-cracking Robin Williams rants. The story works well with a good performance from the Vietnamese brother played by Tung Thanh Tran. But it is all Robin Williams and he shows that maybe he could be a great actor for the first time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Williams found fame on television with Mork &amp; Mindy but his foray into movies was hit and miss so far.He had yet to have a vehicle where his brand of humour can go at full flow. Good Morning Vietnam was it. The story is loosely based on the experiences of Armed Forces Dadio DJ Adrian Cronauer.By playing the DJ he can free-wheel it on the Mic, provides laughs and annoy the authorities in this case Bruno Kirby who certainly does not get his humour and he and JT Walsh conspire to get him off the air. They certainly did not want soldiers being happy.As the story progresses you do enter the world of the drama that took place in Vietnam, but its not quiet the horrors of war in the way films such as Platoon would show it, after all this is till a comedy. However the film still loses it edge when such mundane things like a plot has to be dealt with.This was Williams show where he had a run of performances in comedy and drama that rewarded him with an Oscar a decade later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adrian Cronauer goes to Vietnam as a DJ to help boost morale of American Soldiers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the movie, Adrian explores Vietnam. visits a local English school, bars and markets to fully immerse himself in the Vietnamese lifestyle. During his travels, he made several friends and he eventually got to know a man called Tuan incredibly well. Tuan taught him many local Vietnamese traditions and even introduced him to his sister. As Adrian continued to interact with the local Vietnamese people, he started to enjoy his lifestyle. Unfortunately, the sergeant and lieutenant were constantly at his back and demanded that he change the content of his broadcasts, as they weren't appropriate for the soldiers. This and the fact that the military censored so many things really made Adrian upset. In his opinion, he strongly believes the soldiers have the right to know everything, something that the higher ups do not support. As he continued to broadcast in that manner, he was eventually suspended for a period of time but he was later brought back due to the soldier's demand. Towards the end of the segment, Adrian discovers Tuan's true identity, a terrorist wanted by the South Vietnamese police. This results in the loss of a close friend and his job and after five months of working in Vietnam, he departs the country. This movie really portrays life in Vietnam. It doesn't focus on the battlefield but more on the way that American soldiers and civilians alike adapted to the Vietnamese lifestyle. In one of the bar scenes, Americans are shown to be racist to the South Vietnamese, in the bar, which is similar to the way white Americans used to treat African Americans. An American soldier insults Tuan and Adrian takes offense to the treatment that his close friend is receiving and it results in a fight between him and the soldier. In Vietnam, Adrian also spent lots of time in Vietnamese cinemas and astonishingly, films had English subtitles, showing how great American influence is. Streets in Vietnam are filled with Americans doing their thing and it seems like they're back in America. In the school scene, a soldier taught simple English to the Vietnamese, just like a normal class back in the states. This is an example of pacification in Vietnam. Instead of young kids being taught English, the class consisted of Vietnamese people ranged from teens to the elderly, showing that America is willing to educate the Vietnamese about American Culture. In the story, it is evident that many Vietnamese blame America for the havoc and damage done to the country. Terrorists bombed the bar where Americans wen to and protests were staged against the presence of Americans. The protests became so violent that even the police had to get involved. They discretely killed the traitors/terrorists that threatened the lives of Americans and when it was revealed that Tuan was one of theses traitors, he explain to Adrian, "Enemy? What is an enemy? You killing my own people so many miles from your home. We're not the enemy. You're the enemy. Big deal! My mother's dead. And my older brother, he's dead. Shot by Americans. My neighbor, dead. His wife, dead. Why? Because we're not human to them. We're only little Vietnamese." That scene when Tuan angrily spat out those words to Adrian strongly signified the hatred that the Vietnamese had towards the Americans. Tuan and Adrian were close friends but his hatred of Americans overcame their friendship and eventually, Tuan was caught as a traitor. Lastly, the movie heavily portrays the influence of media and soldier's morale. Over the span of the Vietnam War, many soldiers were homesick, missed their families and on top of that, they had to deal with the many hardships of war such as losing their close friends and comrades. Having to experience such pain affected their morale and many soldiers just wanted to get out of Vietnam. As a DJ, Adrian helped to boost the morale and when he visited the soldiers in the battlefield, his jokes and humor helped to provide happiness and made them feel appreciated, like they had something to live for. Boosting morale was one of the major factors in helping with the war. Unfortunately, soldiers were often never given the whole truth about information. For example, news headlines such as "US military leaders in Saigon urge secretary of Defense, McNamara to approve a force level of 350,000 to 400,000 US soldiers" were censored and nobody knew what it truly said. The higher ups such as the second lieutenant and the generals never told the whole truth, as they didn't want to lower the morale of the troops by talking about the harsh realities of the war. Adrian disagreed with such methods and even though he expressed his disapproval of it, there was nothing he could to change it. In the end, Adrian was able to take away with him friendships with many of the soldiers and local Vietnamese and he was able t truly experience Vietnamese life. This comedy film is entertaining and it is different from many other Vietnam War films as it shows life in South Vietnam, not on the battlefield but how Americans merged with the Vietnamese society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Morning, Vietnam ? How view the Vietnam War from a different angle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Morning, Vietnam is one of the best movie that Robin Williams has made. It's funny, unpretentious, has some real drama without being too heavy, and it brings home some nice open values.Williams' acting is excellent, displaying all of the above qualities, and it will transport you easily into his world. You'll laugh and you'll be touch, even though you might not be able to understand everything he says.It's a very different view point of the Vietnam War, and just that makes the whole film very interesting. It's a must see, even if you don't like movies on that particular subject, because the split between the personal angle and the conflict angle is about even.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some of Williams Finest Work,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Morning Vietnam is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a fantastic cast. The movie is without a doubt some of Robin Williams finest work, one thing that he has proved to us over the course of his outstanding career is that he is great at doing both comedic and dramatic roles, he is given a chance to do both here. The highlights are certainly the scenes where he is hosting the radio show, it is very obvious that Williams got to improvise these lines and they are absolutely hilarious, the humour flies out of him very naturally, as well as a clear knowledge for the Vietnam war. There are some surprising twist and turns throughout that are exciting and take us deep in to the events of the war, many unexpected moments that really shocked me. Delivering both laughs and emotion, I would recommend Good Morning Vietnam to anyone looking for a good comedy, drama or war film. A DJ is assigned to the U.S. Armed Services radio station in Vietnam, however, his outrageous broadcasting style lands him in hot water.Best Performance: Robin Williams</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Williams is absolutely manic and lovable in his turn here as the irreverent disc jockey who lands in Saigon in the late 60s. he does not want to toe the official line, that the radio be a somber voice of the US, but goes all out with his mimicries and obscenities. this is among his best roles, right up there with "good will hunting", "awakenings"," dead poet's society" etc. the dialogues are hilarious and the one liners will make woody Allen proud. this terrific entertainer was directed by Barry Levinson who was in the purple patch of his career, what with the Oscar winning "rain man" to follow the next year. this was a blockbuster when it was released earning close to $130 million dollars. if you are looking for some great acting and fun times, check this out. you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great improv by Williams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Good Morning Vietnam" is the story of Adrian Cronauer - well, that's how it started out - until Robin Williams got his hands on it. The real Cronauer actually didn't employ humor in his broadcasts. But I'm sure he was very happy to have a star such as Robin Williams interested in his story.In the '60s, Cronauer is assigned to the US Armed Services Radio station in Vietnam and finds it pretty dull with a lot of boring music playing. He immediately shakes things up with his broadcasts, which begin GOOD MORNING Vietnam. He makes a lot of jokes, plays a lot of rock music, and infuriates some of the powers that be with his total irreverence. He also develops a crush on a young woman (Chintara Sukapatana) and follows her one day to an English class. He ends up teaching some of the more colloquial phrases to the class, which is delighted, and he becomes friendly with the young woman's brother (Tung Thanh Tran). He starts hanging out at a local bar and even gets used to the food.Despite his immense popularity, the waves he is making threaten to get him drummed out, as he is unhappy about censored news and one day mentions a tragedy that occurred on the radio. Slowly, Cronauer sees more of the war, meets soldiers going into combat, and learns the hard way that he can't trust everyone, and he gets a big-time reality check.Filmed in Thailand, Good Morning, Vietnam is a really excellent film that combines comedy with drama, improvisation with a solid script and manages to show the horror of war and its effect on the citizens and soldiers.Williams, who improvises all of the radio shows, is marvelous as Cronauer, here a man who uses humor in his life until he is faced with some harsh truths -- and even then, in one of his darkest moments, he finds his sense of humor again. Forrest Whitaker, as a soldier working at the radio, gives a wonderful performance. As Lt. Steven Hauk, Bruno Kirby is brilliant as a delusional man who thinks his groan-worthy sense of humor and Mantovani music is just the ticket for a radio show.Well worth seeing by baby boomers for the nostalgia value (though not all good) and by anyone to appreciate the skills of Robin Williams as an actor and comic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams . And it is enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another image of Vietnam. New slice of a kind of M.A.S.H. A comedy with flavor of drama. In fact, only a impressive work of Robin Williams. The art of improvisation is all. The game, mixture of joy and metamorphosis of reality is heart of this film about war but, more that, about the hope and its roots.Interpretation of Williams is not a surprise but the great piece is art to define a fight in different terms. And the science to escape behind any trap. Because no crime, no errors, no gray perceptions are absent. The war is not fiction and the Vietnames are the enemy. But the role of huge show is more small. The relations between ordinary people and the resistance of absurd vision about reality is more powerful. So, it is not a war movie. It is not a comedy. Only picture of a world. And a extraordinary Robin Williams who gives sense to many small facts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Williams sole energy source in "feel good" Nam film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Good Morning Viet Nam Robin Williams takes his stand up act to SEA as an irreverent DJ. A mild mawkish comedy under the mundane style of Barry Levinson who seems content to just turn the zany comic loose it never attains much of an energy level outside Williams inconsistent rants. Transferred from Greece to Nam to DJ and entertain the troops Adrien Cronauer has little respect for the men running the war and he subversively gets it across to the grunts on the ground fighting it who bond with him. His superiors find his attitude trying however and take steps, one very cynical and drastic, to remove him.In his prime Williams took his wacky and irreverent comedy routines and incorporated it into a "Mr. Wonderful" persona in a series of films in which he championed the underdog and vanquished the big bad establishment with his rapier wit. Good Morning may well be the best of the lot with an ideal occupation and situation for Williams to be in but director Levinson brings nothing in terms of a look or a cohesive storyline to the picture. Injecting flaccid montages to accompany the era's music he more or less abdicates his directorship in favor of Robbie coming up with comic gold. There's some dust to be mined but away from the mike Williams drowns in schmaltzy interplay with the child like Asians( courtesy of Levinson's hackneyed patronizing) bridging the gap like LBJ and MacNamara could only dream of. Good Morning Viet Nam is little more than a stage for Williams routine and incite, something you can catch on a late night show in less time and for less money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie depicted the era of the Vietnam War, and presented Robin Williams as Adrian Cronauer. As a DJ for the Armed Forces Radio Service he brought a breath of fresh air and comedy to a very dismal situation. He had quite an impact upon the morale of the enlisted men, but was disliked intensely by Second Lieutenant Steven Hauk played by Bruno Kirby and Sergeant Major Dickerson played by J.T. Walsh. They felt he was severely irreverent. Many films have been made concerning Vietnam such as Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, to name just a few, and they all touch upon the theme concerning the rigors, sadness and horrors of war. This film's twist was to bring a touch of comedy to the misery of the war itself, much like the show M*A*S*H attempted to do. Adrian repeatedly raised the ire of the two officers by doing "skits" where he would change his voice to famous people and conduct phony interviews with them, make sound effects, and play music they considered wrong. In his own way he stated his opinions and versions on issues of the world. One of the many things that angered Adrian was that he couldn't present many news articles, nor always tell the full news stories. He felt they were masking reality from the enlisted men. He made you laugh but between the lines, you felt his sarcasm, frustration, and mockery of things going on. When he did disobey and enlightened everyone to the bombing at Jimmy Wan's he was pulled off the air. This gave Lieutenant Hauk a chance to shine as the DJ which he didn't. He was not funny and actually thought the men would want to hear polka songs. Adrian truthfully did not want to return to the air even after countless letters implored for his return. Thanks to Garlick stopping on the road as troops were about to go into battle, Adrian was pressed into an impromptu "show". It was then he realized that his show was extremely vital to the men for coping with the anguish of the war. One of the saddest parts of the movie is when Adrian realized that Traun, who he considered a good friend, was in actuality a VC operative. It hurt him to know that Traun was behind the bombing of the G.I. bar. Because of this revelation and friendship, Dickerson is overjoyed to be able to give Adrian an honorable discharge. Even at the end of the movie, Adrian's character is revealed. He stops on the way to the airport, to set up a softball game with the members from his English class. Garlick takes over as the DJ for Adrian, and plays a last tape from him. Instead of his usual cry of "Goooooood morning Vietnam", he responds with "Goodbyeee Vietnam".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie again after seeing it over and over again in the late 1980's. It remains as intriguing, funny and thought provoking as it did way back then. The only thing that upsets me watching this movie is the painful reminder how just how much Robin Williams' films have tanked in the last two decades. I hate to say it but the fact is that Robin Williams sold out a long, long time ago. Sure he had a major breakthrough with "Good Will Hunting" back in 1997, but that was a Drama. All his supposed "Comedies" have gotten less funny and more stag-net as time has gone by. There are far too many to list but the major stinkaroo titles would be "Fathers day", "Patch Adams" and that bottom feeder of a comedy "RV". Take more time to look over these scripts your getting Mr. Williams. Think Carefully!</fullReview>

Levinson brings us the life of the legendary D-J Adrian Cronauer who did all the funny stuff during the infamous Vietnam War way back in the 1960's. 'Good Morning, Vietnam' works because the journey we take, was real and it's hilarious. Levinson has mastered in Direction, he knows how to execute an important subject, his work is quite exceptional. A film that keeps you hooked in those odd 120 minutes. It's amongst the best I've seen from the 80's, a high-class film.'Good Morning, Vietnam' would've been a mark short if Robin Williams didn't appear in it. There is no Robin Williams here, it's Adrian Cronauer who takes us through his adventurous journey. There are some actors &amp; then there is Robin Williams. The Veteran-Actor surpasses himself, this is his careers finest work to date. Take a bow, Mr.Williams! 'Good Morning, Vietnam' rules, it's a winner all the way. Now here's a film that not only depicts real life incidents, but also entertains &amp; enlightens when it's over. Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been trying to watch this movie for ages without any success. I heard that Robin Williams makes wonders in this film. Finally I managed to watch this movie, now that the new year has arrived.The movie itself is okay, although in many ways better than I expected. But indeed Robin Williams is pure genius in this one! This is one of his very best performances, along with 'Dead Poets Society', 'Hook', 'Aladdin', 'A.I.' and 'Popeye'.Set in Saigon during the Vietnam War, this is also a war movie. It's not entirely comedy. Robin Williams also does a great job in drama here, but it's his comedy skills that really make him shine. This is Robin Williams at his best! Robin portrays Adrian Cronauer, a disc jockey on Armed Forces Radio Service who greatly amuses the troops serving in South Vietnam but angers his superiors with his irreverence (they don't have any sense of humor, really - or they're envious of him). But, unlike Robin's character, the real Adrian wasn't that funny.Robin is hysterical whenever he is on the air: he makes voices (typically Robin), he mixes unusual humor with news updates... and I loved it whenever he starts his show by yelling «Gooooooooooood Morning, Vietnam!», as well as whenever he pretends to be a teacher.Robin also puts nice music in this film, such as Beach Boys, James Brown's "I Feel Good" and Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World". There are some errors of dates, though. The movie takes place in 1965 and the song "What a Wonderful World" came out in 1967. But that detail is not to be taken very seriously.Trinh, the Thai girl, is quite pretty. Whoever is the actress who portrayed this character, she did a good job.Overall, a reasonable film without being great. It is particularly worthy for Robin Williams's genial humor which takes this movie far. Robin was so fun in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Morning A Better Film Than Often Thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the time this movie was released, most viewers went to it expecting a straight comedy film because Robin Williams was a star on the hit sit-com Mork &amp; Minday. The viewers were surprised because this movie accomplished more than that, &amp; because of this got mixed reviews. It wasn't fair.The story is based upon the real life experience a DJ &amp; what he did when he went to do armed forces radio in Vietnam. The accuracy of the tale gets lost because of the Hollywood Treatment but when you look at this film, it is very successful on an entertainment level, and the film is well made.Robin Williams comedy in this is very good. The surprise at that time is how solid his acting is. He is able to mix comedy and drama here in a very profound way considering this is one of his earlier films. Hollywood really has not served the memories of the Vietnam war accurately on any level so it is not a surprise that exists here.While great directors have made great films addressing Vietnam, there is a haze that still exists over their efforts because Vietnam &amp; the reason for being there is especially now looking back, a mystery. It did serve one major change in the United States which has changed history.Vietnam more than anything else ended the compulsory military draft in the United States so far. That draft was a form of slavery Abe Lincoln had to invoke in order to win the civil war. It was never questioned until Vietnam. This movie doesn't really show why that happened, but it does try to tell the real story of someone who actually went to Vietnam &amp; tried to make a difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Institutional dependence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a rather old film on the Vietnam War. It has aged. The denunciation of the censorship that existed in the US forces in Vietnam, is still efficient, but it deals with the past. The Vietnam War is finished. The humor about the ex-Vice-Président Nixon, is of course a lot less efficient today, because a lot of time has gone by. The vision of the war is still very mild, though it emphasizes, still, the fact that the Viet Congs were everywhere, and it states in a very few sentences the real motivations of these young people who joined the fight against the Americans : personal, victims all around them, and the fact that they were at home, and the Americans were not. But the film has taken, since its first release, a completely new meaning, more allegoric but also tremendously strong. This time it has do only with the functioning of an institution, no matter which, that has to respect some norms coming from above and not from its audience, its public. It has to do with censorship and the desire and tendency of some people to refuse it in the name of the good old freedom of expression and of the press. Just this point, repeated quite many times, shows how strong such a functioning is. But the film delves into the human relations that come along with this general functioning. Those who detain authority in this institution feel frustrated by those who rebel against the censorship they try to impose. And it reveals that the former will try to do anything they can do get rid of the troublemaker : they will send him on an impossible and death-ridden mission, hoping he will be killed ; then they will build up a file trying to show that he is a traitor and has to be courtmartialed, and then they will condescendently move him out of the way with a nice speech on generosity, clemency and even compassion. This denunciation of this terroristic functioning of any institution, public or private, is still valid and full of relevance. On that level the film has not aged one single iota.

		<shortDescription>"Good morning, Vietnam." What the heck is that supposed to mean?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a move designed to hopefully boost the morale of the troops in Vietnam, DJ Adrian Cronauer is sent to Saigon to rock the airwaves. He does, in more ways than one, and as the madness of the war takes hold, Cronauer, his superiors and those closest to him, are all about to get taught some life lessons.Based on the story of real life army disc jockey Adrian Cronauer, Good Morning Vietnam plonks us straight into Saigon in 1965. Before Cronauer's arrival at the radio station, the harried and weary American troops had been served a diet of boorish drone music and droopy health awareness programmes. Cronauer tore down the schedules and cranked out the likes of The Beach Boys, James Brown and Motown standards, all linked by Cronauer's spitfire patter and propensity for close to the knuckle humour. All of which made Cronauer a hero to the listening troops and a foe of the top brass. Enter Robin Williams as Cronauer.Finally getting a vehicle to showcase his scattergun improvisation talents, Williams goes full tilt to make Cronauer a part of 1980s pop culture. Most of the studio scenes are just Williams let loose by director Barry Levinson. Given free rein {Levinson merely picked out the best bits from reams of tape} to poke fun at anything remotely military. So much so, the radio station sequences have a unique feel of exuberance about them, so really it's inevitable that when the film moves away from the station it's going to be something of a shift in mood. During these shifts Cronauer is involved in a would be romance, a friendship with a teenage Vietnamese boy, a teaching arc and dalliances with his sidekick Edward Garlick {an excellent Forest Whitaker}. Whilst the dialogue remains zippy and humorous, the film is suffering because of its radio station high points, and the finale is as divisive today as it was with audiences back on release.However, the film remains a joyous viewing in spite of its irritants, and it should be noted that in amongst the jollification, Levinson is affording the Vietnamese people respect by way of portraying them as cultured and complex folk. How many Vietnam War film directors can say that I wonder? Backing up Williams and Whitaker is a cringe worthy turn from Bruno Kirby, with added weight coming in the form of an uptight J.T. Walsh. Nicely shot in Bangkok and Phuket by Peter Sova, scored appropriately by Alex North, and containing a delightful foot tapping soundtrack, Good Morning Vietnam overcomes its flaws and delivers something of a debatable 80s classic. 8/10</fullReview>

Forest Whitaker, is good as the side kick, with his expressions being right all the time. But what stands out about this film is that this film succeeds in not being partial to America, nor is it partial to Vietnam.

		<shortDescription>A very good morning indeed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The interesting thing about "Good Morning, Vietnam" is that so little of the horrors of the Vietnam War are shown, that the film effectively portrays the horror and senselessness of war. Director Barry Levinson instead shows shots of a printing machine showing the number of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam. The numbers constantly rise. It's very effective.Essentially, though, "Good Morning Vietnam" is a hilarious comedy starring the master of improvisation, Robin Williams. Williams plays a non-conformist radio DJ, who essentially tries making the troops laugh. The GIs love him, but the military's top brass (especially Sgt. Major Dickerson, played by J.T. Walsh) is up in arms.Interesting enough, by the end of "Good Morning Vietnam", we learn so much more about the characters? except Adrian Cronauer (Williams). He uses his comedy as a wall, keeping people from learning about him. When stranded in the wilderness, he starts using one-liners on the trees, for instance. This is a guy who remains a secret because he wants to? and it works, developing his character better than any back-story could.Another extremely effective touch in "Good Morning, Vietnam" is the music. Sometimes, I'm not a fan of music with lyrics in films (most often, instrumental music works best, in my humble opinion). But in "Good Morning, Vietnam", songs about love are being played to accompany a time of war. It's a successful move.The acting of the film is exemplary, including a touching performance by an actor you probably never heard of, Tung Thanh Tran. Memorable performances come from Robin Williams, Forest Whitaker, and J.T. Walsh, and Williams even got an Oscar nomination for his performance.To conclude, "Good Morning, Vietnam" is an interesting (to say the least) mix between wartime drama and comedy, aside from being plain old hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought that a film on the Vietnam conflict could be funny but here it is, drink it up. Of course, now you've got more comedy war films these days (Tropic Thunder Anyone?) but I think this would be one of the first comedy based war films. Robin Williams outdoes himself here in a very innocent honest performance, hilarious and very human at the same time. His basic mindset is to brighten up the lives of some soldiers in a very grim, disturbing situation but anal politically correct superiors (the late great Bruno Kirby) hold him down. I honesty contemplate the weirdness of this. Blood and gore is outside all over the bloody place while some people are trying to sensor a morale boosting DJ!? Strange but true.Along with being one of the first war comedies it's gotta be one of the first movies to show the Vietnamese as actual humans. They live, breathe and die while some biased movies try to vilify everyone single one of them as blood lusting monsters. It's a nice change but this movie falls behind some movies (Apocolypse Now, Platoon) and beats others (Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill) just for the simple fact that this was funnier while not losing any seriousness in the process. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GOOD MORNING, Vietnam!Those are the words that open up DJ Adrian Cronauer's (Robin Williams) broadcast to all soldiers in southern Vietnam during the war, the beginning of a time block filled with hilarity and setting a humorous tone to a very harsh war. That's what the premise of the film by that title is all about, and how Cronauer's non-traditional radio and rock 'n roll music choice caused a stir on the Vietnam airwaves.Barry Levinson's film is humorous, but it attempts also to be very serious in addressing censorship and the fact that so much of the war's actual events were kept undisclosed from the soldiers. The comedy is the most successful part, simply because Robin Williams is a fast-talking runaway train of humor. While the rest of the film isn't as effective, it certainly makes an effort. "Good Morning, Vietnam" has a chance to take on more serious meaning, but it does so very casually and without true intent to be serious. After all, the genre listed is comedy, so that's what the film is.While some scenes, like the montage to "What A Wonderful World," present a harsh irony and really show the war for what it was versus how it was perceived, those scenes get lost in the not as serious jumble of scenes and other scenes that are more serious but not nearly as effective. The conflict with Cronauer and those telling him he's wrong is probably the more effective of the drama compared to commentary on the war."Good Morning" is still a film that should be watched. It accurately shows a time and place in world history while not being a traditional take on it. You can enjoy the humor and see the war for what it was and that's a good feat for a movie.</fullReview>

Williams was born to play this role and is brilliant as Cronaur.the supporting cast all put in great performances,as well.but credit must also go to director Barry Levinson,who keeps the flow of the movie intact.the dramatic scenes are handled very well,and as i said never drift into maudlin territory.and given the movie's sensitive subject matter,Levinson does very well at keeping the movie from crossing the line into bad taste.I really enjoyed this movie.it is well worth spending the 2 hours.a strong 9* out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant multi-dimensional film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a superb mix of contrasts, Robin Williams at his insane best but against a backdrop of a very serious story and how Uncle Sam's interference how ever well intentioned just creates a mess. Given that the Vietnam war was 40 years ago and this review is being written some 40 years later (nearly 20 years after the film was made) it is interesting to see parallels with what has followed in American actions since and also in what is going on today.Some wonderful 60 music adds a real highlight to the film, against some the intense interactions of Williams and the other characters.The humour is top class, and even if you are not a Williams fan I doubt you could fail to appreciate it. It just frame &amp; highlights some powerful messages.In my book this is a top notch film that can be enjoyed thru countless re-runs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Morning Vietnam is not a comedy but you will laugh like nothing before. It is about the Vietnam War but really it is about courage. It is a drama and a love story full of emotions and you will laugh and cry and be amazed by Mr. Williams performance all at he same time. This is no doubt his best movie ever, even if I'll admit that the Dead Poets Society comes pretty close. On top of including all of the above features, Good Morning Vietnam is also based on a true story and in my opinion very realistic. And that is what makes it so unique. First, find a movie that features the fun, the emotions, the tragedy, the characters, the setup, the story and the atmosphere of this brilliant peace of film-making. Then find one that is believable. You will only find Good Morning Vietnam. The best film I have ever seen. Go watch it and see for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is a perfect blend of humor and seriousness. Robin Williams is so hilarious in this film and is said to have been hand picked by Adrian Cronauer himself. One of my favorite quotes is, "What is with this 'Police Action'? Sounds like a couple of cops in New York saying, 'Hey, she looks good to me?' ". If you are looking for a war movie,though, this is not for you. The film focuses more on Adrien Cronauer, and less on the war itself. It gives underlying truths concerning cultural differences, rank differences, and censorship. Plus, it's just downright funny! If you have not seen this film, then go immediately to a place of video rental or purchase and buy it, or rent it, and watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Morning, Vietnam is probably one of the most underrated films about the Vietnam conflict, loosely based on Radio jock Adrian Cronauer, the first man to play rock and roll on Army airwaves.Robin Williams, as Army DJ Adrian Cronauer, is at his acting pinnacle in this movie, merging between comic lunacy and gut-wrenching desolation at the blink of an eye. The support cast, including Forest Whitaker and Robert Wuhl also shine in this film, and special mention goes to Bruno Kirby as Lt. Steve Hauk, who almost usurps Williams from his comedic throne.Beautifully shot by director Barry Levinson and cinematographer Peter Sova in Thailand and with amazingly visceral cut scenes set to a backdrop of various sixties and seventies rock and roll songs. The montage set against Louie Armstrong's "What A Wonderful World" is especially moving, perfectly highlighting what it was like in Saigon during the conflict.This is a must see film for any Robin Williams fan, or indeed anyone who just likes a good movie. An excellent, entertaining and disturbing picture of the Vietnam War.</fullReview>

The movie did not follow the script and made significant changes as to what happened. I had the pleasure of hearing Mr. Cronauer speak and his comment on the movie was, "If I did half of what was portrayed, I'd still be in Leavenworth." He also stayed his full tour of duty, not truncated to six months as the movie indicates. Both are super personalities, Adrian Cronauer and Roger Williams. I salute both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were a lot of things I liked in this movie, all centered around Robin Williams' performance as Adrian Cronauer, an army DJ during the early Vietnam War. This was really a perfect role for him, combining the radio improv hilarity (similar to his other earlier work) with the touchy feely aspect of his relationships with the locals (characteristic of his newer roles). The supporting cast was solid, but Williams really carries the movie.The main problem I had with this movie was that it didn't know whether it wanted just to tell a good story or really drive home a message. There are a lot of moralizing elements, but in the end it seems that Cronauer is more concerned about his own skin than any greater good; for me the ending didn't quite jive with what led up to it. To be fair, it was a well-done characterization of a basically good man who is not perfect; it's nice to see a movie where the protagonist has limits, where the "hero" is not a superman.The baseball game is a classic scene; the movie as a whole is a bit slow but this scene is worth waiting for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Williams' role in this film is probably his best known to date, as it should be. This is a great film! I suppose this falls in the category of comedy, but there is also a great deal of drama in the film as well. The film has some interesting things to say about war, politics, racism, friendship, the military and a few other things (or at least that's what I got out of it). Of course, the comedy greatly outweighs the drama in the film and is absolutely great all the way through the film. If you are a fan of Robin Williams' comedy, be sure to check this film out. The cast in this film is very good. Robin Williams is, of course, just fantastic in the film. He's a little nutty sometimes, but that is to be expected and that's what the role called for. Forest Whitaker is very good in his role and plays a very likeable character. Bruno Kirby, on the other hand, plays a very UN-likeable character, but did a fantastic job with the role. The rest of the supporting cast was very good as well: JT Walsh, Robert Wuhl, Noble Willingham, etc... Director, Barry Levinson, did a very good job with this film as usual. If you are a fan of Robin Williams or any of the cast/crew, then you should definitely check out this film. If you like war-comedy films, then you should take a look at this film. I feel that the film is most definitely worth seeing, so do yourself a favor and go see it. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

I laughed REALLY hard when Adrian (Robin Williams) did the traffic report ("How's the traffic on the Ho Chi Minh Trail?"), imitated famous people (such as Gomer Pyle), made fun of the weather ("It's hot! D*** hot!"), and all the funny stuff he did. It was REALLY funny! The music was also good -- Especially the rock 'n' roll that Adrian played. In conclusion, to all you Robin Williams fans who have not seen this gut-busting, based-on-a-true-story comedy/drama/war flick, I HIGHLY recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Williams the Big Movie Star!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gooood Mooorrnning, Vieeetnamm!!!" screams Robin Williams from the big screen as he stakes a claim once and for all to be recognised as a long awaited Big Movie Star-an actor in his own right. This achievement is made with the aid of a well-scripted storyline, supporting cast and fine direction, with of course that certain special 'Williams-thing' that was his bread and butter even at this time of things-stand up/sit down improvisational comedy in front of a microphone. This all makes for a truly rare, wonderful and unusual scenario unlike any film of this genre. It's a touchy subject but it's all handled beautifully, making it a touching subject more than anything which can be very few and far between in any routine comedy/drama.Robin Williams has come a long way since his TV days of 'Nah-nu, nah-nu' as he sets out to portray that he can handle the heavy and demanding scenes as well as anything else. But, he had already gone through the motions of these kind of scenes previously with the likes of the classic 'World According To Garp','Moscow On The Hudson' and the maudlin 'Seize the Day'.In this film the 'Williams-machine' all came together for the very first time as he portrays his version of Adrian Cronauer, the Armed Forces Radio D.J. sent out to Saigon in 1965 to help whip everyone's morale into shape-and that he certainly did! Well, maybe not everyone's has one or two of the top ranks aren't too pleased with such quips as "the Big Dick is here!..." when referring to a visit from Vice-President, Richard Nixon.When you see Williams,as Cronauer, perform the comedy routines on, and off, the Airwaves, all you can do is watch in hilarious wonderment and ask just exactly what kind of brain are we witnessing here.'Good Morning, Vietnam' is billed as a Comedy/Drama, but it was the Drama aspect of it that for me, certainly shone through as much as the hilarity side of the script. All the aspects that centred around this angle of the Vietnam War-Cronauer in trouble with his superiors, falling in love, and ultimately crossing the political line of fire, all make for a creative piece of film-making, and certainly one that deserved it's Oscar nominations. Mr.Williams seems to have a flair for making this type of comedy with a mix of the unusual dramatics, and this seems to have started with the aforementioned 'Garp' and is continued after 'Vietnam' with the lesser-rated, but rather amicable 'Cadillac Man' and the absorbing 'Fisher King'.Anyway, no matter what, you will laugh, cry and laugh again at 'Good Morning, Vietnam'-it is a classic. And, don't forget all those great sixties tunes in the background.</fullReview>

Walsh will be remembered in 40 years time primarily because they made GMV!.It IS very funny (do not be tempted to watch in any other language but original!) yet is a very serious film - definitely not Arnold and Dolf type. It brings to attention just another side if Nam war but not only. A delicate but nonetheless impressive show of characters under the strain of another "...for the sake of the nation..." crusade.No Vietnam theme is complete without GMV and it certainly deserves buying a DVD player just to have this single movie in collection - because you'll play it over and over again.It is not enough to put together light, film, camera and a few actors to make a movie. It takes talent, luck and some magic to make real ones. These guys had all three of it.</fullReview>

A wise-cracking star of humour and moral to the soldiers of Vietnam while higher officials around him build a dislike toward him through his satirical approach to the politics surrounding the war. Through his sense of loyalty to his work and to the soldiers of Vietnam he bucks authority and tries to make a difference.As I said, this is one of the most magical and memorable films I have seen. I wouldn't describe this film, however, as a comedy. The film is indeed very funny and I still find it impossible not to laugh through the radio broadcasts. But I also found the tone of the film sets itself apart from the comedy and describes the Vietnam war in a very serious and moving way.It is very rare that I would rate a film as highly as I do this.

The GI's love his style but the commanders aren't so thrilled with his comedy. Sidesplitting comic bombshells and studded with hot '60's hits, the film depicts Cronauer's raucous Saigon adventures amid a world gone mad. Williams is brilliant in his portrayal of Adrian as this seems like the part he was meant to play with his quick instincts and non-stop humor.

		<shortDescription>A predictable, dull film that's merely a vehicle for Williams's tediously overbearing comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a great Family Guy cutaway gag in which Peter Griffin and Robin Williams are sitting on a sofa as Peter names topics such as religion and politics for Williams to comment on. Williams does so with his trademark brand of insufferable overbearing comedy, which is filling any amount of time with incessant, frenetic rambling. Peter responds simply with an exasperated sigh before leaving for a five minute break, which prompts Williams to start yet another barrage of supposedly funny noises.I felt much like Peter Griffin whilst watching Good Morning Vietnam, it reaffirmed my opinion that Williams was not the 'tragicomic genius' that so many purported him to be. Williams was much better as a straight actor.Read a short synopsis of Vietnam and you'll know exactly what it's all about: the lovable family favourite Robin Williams being kooky, charming the troops but clashing with straight-laced, humourless authority figures. It's completely predictable and completely trite. They also throw in a love interest for good measure in the form of Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana), a wholly lifeless woman whom Williams refuses to stop pestering.Williams is never funny during his radio broadcasts, however the film repeatedly tells us otherwise, showing us scores of characters struggling to hold back their tears of laughter. So many of the supporting actors, whether they're random troops or studio operators, were just diegetic canned laughter rather than proper characters.Make no mistake, Robin Williams isn't playing Adrian Cronauer, he's playing Robin Williams at his most loud and rambling. Williams is repeatedly characterised as the lovable clown who brings the people together, it's rather nauseating; no matter how hard the film tries, it cannot convince me that he's either funny or charming, only very irritating. Despite this, there are some moments that raised a smile, such as the language class scenes in which he focuses on New York City street talk rather than the artificial, staid sentences of the textbooks.Williams's flatly developed adversaries Lt. Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Sgt. Major Dickinson (J.T. Walsh) are the typical officious military men, they develop a resentment towards him that's so instantaneous that it's contrived and unbelievable; they're just narrative functions that try and make you feel sorry for Williams the lovable crazy cookie. Both characters aggressively impose their superior ranks on Williams and the other men, reminding me of the great Machiavelli quote ? 'It is not titles that make men illustrious, but men who make titles illustrious.' Quite frankly, the quote is wasted on a trivial, tiringly irritating film like this.It sometimes attempts to be a drama or 'dramedy' with moments of perfunctory war moralising, but ultimately Good Morning, Vietnam is preoccupied with indulging Williams's penchant for shouting incessantly rather than achieving anything approaching credible commentary or pathos. 45%www.hawkensian.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based (very loosely) on a true story. Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) is sent to Saigon in 1965. He's a radio DJ and is sent there to boost the morale of the troops. His off the wall manner on the radio and jokes make him very popular--but he meets opposition from obnoxious Sgt. Dickerson (J.T. Walsh) and stupid Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby). Then he falls in love with a Vietnamese woman and realizes he can't just ignore the violence all around him.This was a huge hit in 1987. This is the movie that made Williams a star. I loved it back then but not so much now. Williams' rantings on the radio really aren't that funny--the sequence where he entertains servicemen outside on trucks going off to combat has more laughs than anything else. Also this move shoves its sentimentality down your throat (it's no surprise this is a Disney picture). We hear these beautiful songs of the period over scenes of revolution and violence. Everything is painted in black and white. Walsh and Kirby are one-dimensional villains and Williams comes across as almost perfect.The acting is all good and Williams non-stop comedy bits are occasionally funny. But this movie just about grabs you by the throat and forces you to cry and just pours on the syrup. Worth seeing but no great shakes.</fullReview>

As a Conservative, I have to give the Liberals credit, they do know how to make entertaining films which capture the beauty and the horror of men's experiences in war. My third favorite, of course in honor of John Wayne, is "THE GREEN BERETS." Not in the class of GM,V or Platoon, but a good entertaining western set in Vietnam.Robin Williams should have been given the Oscar for his performance as Airman Adrian Cronauer even if the experiences of Cronauer were a bit fictionalized. Probably a best supporting award for Forest Whitaker would also have been in order.As with Platoon, Good Morning, Vietnam has that look and feel and smell of Vietnam and the war. Possibly you have to have been there to smell it in a movie, but a Vietnam Vet will know what I am talking about.This film has a note of sadness to it from another angle. Three great character actors who gave realistic and credible performances are no longer with us. Noble Willingham, Bruno Kirby and J.T. Walsh. They each played characters who were very much like men who were in Vietnam. Some good, Willingham as the General; some confused, Kirby as the 2nd. Lt.; and J. T. Walsh as Sgt. Maj. Dickerson. Oh for real, there were a bunch of Sgt. Maj. Dickersons in Vietnam.This is a 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams tries to save the day...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams turns this mediocre story into a one man show. Still, the laughs yielded here are far less than if there hadn't been such an emphasis on how funny he is... Laughter cannot come out forcefully. The anti-war messages in this movie aren't enough to deviate from a sublime American propaganda. When Robin Williams demands censorship-free news like back home he gets "this is not America" as an answer. It is implied by both that such things never happen in the States. Not to mention that the information censored was never about doubting the war but facts that would possibly hamper the army's moral. When the Vietnamese boy expresses the agony of his people, the "anti-war" DJ exclaims "we are only here to help"! Any sentimental attachment Williams had with the locals seems to be in the realm of joke. Even his little affair with the young girl doesn't seem to overshadow him a bit. At the same time he is very convincing when saluting the U.S. soldiers. He also feels pity for the pick-up bar ran by a perversive underworld local.... Excessive coarse jokes also spoil some possibilities for humor. Silence is funnier sometimes. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Struggles to be important. (minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Morning Vietnam is the Hollywood clean version of the Vietnam war. The movie is set in 1965, the first year of the declared war on Vietnam. However, we are looking at the 1980s white-washed version of the war and Vietnam itself during American occupation, which was typical to the decade in seeking to compensate for a war lost (also see Rambo).1965 may've been the start of the declared war, but Vietnam was a country in military struggle for most of it's existence. Just having fought a war with the French, I doubt that even the South Vietnamese setting was so peaceful and pleasant (though economically ravaged) as this movie shows you. But unfortunately, I suppose it would have to, in order to draw your attention to the story--the battle of the airwaves.Robin Williams plays Adrian Cronauer, an air force transferee who gets assigned to the local radio broadcasting station in Saigon. He is central to the movie's attempt at being defiant. But defiant against what? The war? Unruly authority? Given the way the story fluctuates and the various importance on several characters (not just Williams's character), it's hard to tell. Cronauer's unusual broadcasting personality makes him popular against the soldiers in the field, but he is a thorn in the side of his superiors, Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Phillip Dickerson (JT Walsh) who prefer he stick to format. Cronauer is a hit with his monologues and rock n' roll hour. He's a pretty tough character, not caring much about the threats from Hauk and Dickerson, knowing that he's doing something good for the soldiers at least, who seem to enjoy it. He tests the waters with his commanding officers, however, when he tries to read the censored news bulletins on aired, hoping to remove the illusion of a "happy" war. But, even here, it doesn't seem like Cronauer is much of a character that stands out as a defiant one, and it looks like his actions had absolutely no effect on the soldier or anything like that (at least as far as the movie shows you). So where they were going with this aspect of the plot is pretty unclear (or perhaps, unfinished).This is typical Robin Williams comedy, let loose for quite a few minutes at a time to splurge on semi-humorous monologues (at least when he doesn't do his impersonations so fast that you can't discern what he's saying). It is funny at moments, but most of the jokes are pretty stupid. It is nothing exciting, nor particularly engaging (though he does have some funny dialogue when it comes from the script). The more interesting secondary characters such as Forrest Whitakker are hardly developed in any sort of interest at all, and probably would've been necessary anyway to get some direction for this damned story and from the central character. This is not one movie that I really enjoyed with some exception, and I fail to see what the big fuss is about it after all these years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Williams paean to himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you approach this as another Robin Williams exercise in self-aggrandisement, (in the mold of "Patch Adams" and "Bicentennial Man") you won't be disappointed. The laughs in "Good Morning Vietnam" rely upon William's ability to talk so fast that the audience assumes that the bits they miss must be priceless (as an experiment, I listened really hard during a couple of soliloquies, and they definitely weren't funny). Some comedians are sharp enough to improvise and have the audience rolling around on the floor, but Williams really needs a script in order to prevent him falling back on his "camp impression" and other assorted wacky voices. Cue segues to the soldiers actually wiping away the tears of laughter at his routine, in order to convey to us how hilarious he is. Such guidance is a relief, as otherwise I would never have realized. This film falls into the (dominant) "please love me" category of his career, before his agent took him aside to say: "you're perceived as a bit mawkish Robin, you need to roughen up your edges by playing a psychotic film developer". To sum up, if - as I do - you positively enjoy watching a performance so cringeworthy that it will disjoint your toes, this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing more amazing that there are tastless viewers that don't see the humor in this movie is the fact that you would actually print their responses like they were "expert critics". Williams delivers playing fast talking discjockey Adrian Cronouer. He is hilarious in the fast talking lines that he delivers over the air and the movie also has an interesting serious side too, showing the pointless destruction that war brings about. This movie delivers from both angles, from the funny to the serious. The other actors such as Forrest Whitaker complimented Williams quite well and this movie deserves high marks. 8 out of 10 definitely (or 3.5 out of 4)</fullReview>

It was also nice to see the relationship that develops with Williams and one of the Vietnamese boys in the film.

		<fullReview>Barry Levinson mixes rock 'n' roll and comedy with the Viet Nam conflict. This movie makes Robin Williams a 'big' screen star. Airman Adrian Cronauer(Williams)is assigned to an Armed Forces Radio station in the DMZ. He brings with him an irreverent, crude, and some times lewd comedy to the air waves. He plays a real good selection of 60's tunes and brings a piece of home to his listeners. Several of his commanding officers don't agree with his style of comedy and wish that he take his rapid-fire wit and banter elsewhere. Of course, the war goes on and so does life.This ensemble cast also features: Forest Whitaker, Bruno Kirby, Robert Wuhl and J.T. Walsh.</fullReview>

Free-wheeling and funny with Williams improvising like mad (director Barry Levinson reportedly had three cameras running at all times and encouraged the stream-of-consciousness stylings).

		<shortDescription>Rising Star: Robin Williams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The funny thing about this film, I really didn't hear too much about it, I had just read a lot about it in my film books and how this movie pretty much made Robin Williams what he is today. I love Robin Williams, he is one of the greatest comedic actors of our time and not to mention a terrific man who really gets involved in his charities, I have a lot of respect for him, so I figured that I should probably see this movie since I'm a pretty decent fan of his. While it wasn't as outrageous as Mrs. Doubtfire, it was still a fun and realistic movie that made you laugh and feel.Robin plays Adrien, a marine who has been brought to Vietnam actually for a radio show due to his comedic reputation and he blows his audience away with great sketches along with the best music of our time. But Adrien is also somewhat playing with fire when he decides to read "unofficial" news that shouldn't be broadcast according to the military, which disappoints Adrien since the audience is being held back from the truth. He also makes some Vietnese friends, one of which he finds out to be part of the enemy while he is in love with the enemy's sister.Good Morning, Vietnam really shined Robin William's talents and strength towards being a star. He and the cast brought together a great comedy mixed with very dark drama. It had great acting and a unique story that I'm sure that anyone could enjoy. While it's not really a true Vietnam movie, it's still a decent film that deserves a look. This film did terrific things for Robin, we owe it to this film for that.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GOOD MORNING, Vietnam, in my opinion, is a gut-busting comedy/drama/war flick. I laughed really hard when Adrian (Robin Williams) did the traffic report ("How's the traffic on the Ho Chi Minh Trail?"), imitated famous people (such as Gomer Pyle), made fun of the weather ("It's hot! D*** hot!"), and all the funny stuff he did. It was really funny! The music was also good, especially the rock 'n' roll that Adrian played. However, I simply couldn't stand Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Dickerson (J.T. Walsh). This was because they seemed to have no sense of humor. In conclusion, to all you Robin Williams fans who have not seen this gut-busting, true story comedy/drama/war flick, I highly recommend it.

		<shortDescription>The wrong man. In the wrong place. At the right time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?Goooooooood morning, Vietnam', is the catch cry of irreverent, nonconformist Army Radio DJ Adrian Cronauer, and once you have heard it for the first time you know that you are in for a special performance from one of Hollywood's great comedic actors. Placed in Saigon, in the middle of the Vietnam War, Cronauer has a very unique style of Dee-Jaying, which makes him very popular with the troops, but not so with his officials. This is Robin Williams at his very best, in a role that he was born to do.Imported by the Army for an early a.m. radio show, Adrian Cronauer blasts the formerly staid, sanitised airwaves with a constant barrage of rapid-fire humour and the hottest hits from back home. The G.I.s love him - but the brass is up in arms! Riddled with side-splitting comic bombshells and studded with hot '60s hits, Good Morning Vietnam depicts Cronauer's raucous Saigon adventures amid a world gone mad.I really enjoyed the story of GMV. As I am writing this review, the world is at war, so I feel that a movie like this can help to bring into perspective what war might be like. The story is based around the Vietnam War, with Adrian Cronauer brought into strut his stuff on the air. From the first time we hear Adrian do his radio show, the movie is placed into overdrive, as we get one of the great comedic performances. GMV was directed by Barry Levinson in a really clever way. I love how he shows Cronauer to cause a great commotion during the war, while not shying away from other issues concerning the war. Levinson used the very funny screenplay written by Mitch Markowitz. I love the characters Mitch wrote in the story, and the humour that was placed in the lead character of Cronauer. So with all that in prospective, if Robin Williams did not bring the right comedic feel to the movie, it could have gone wrong. But as the good comedian that he is, Williams pulled the role off. He was so funny in front of the microphone, adlibbing his way through all his radio show. When he is not, he is almost as funny, trying to pick up Vietnamese girls of the street, going as far as to be an English teacher to attract one sweet girl called Trinh (Chintara Sukupatana). These scenes are extremely funny, as Cronauer uses a lot of his humour to allow himself to fit into the class. Adrian's help while on the air is Edward Garlick (Forest Whittaker). He rides through all the highs and lows Cronauer has in Vietnam and is strongly influenced by what sort of character Cronauer is. The other character that is helped by Cronauer is another DJ, Marty Lee Dewitz (Robert Wuhl) who is totally in awe of DJ Cronauer who has swept in from places we actually do not know. Yet there are characters here that do not like Adrian, which in turn I feel us as the audience, are not meant to like either. Lt Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) is infuriated by the style of broadcasting that Cronauer has brought to Armed Forces Radio, so much so that he tries his own hand at Cronauer's show. However, he is a terrible replacement, with the troops causing quite a commotion, asking for the irreverent DJ to be reinstated immediately. The other official that Cronauer rubs up the wrong way is Major Philip ?Dick' Dickerson (J.T. Walsh). He has no time for Adrian's smartass attitude and has contempt for the man, evening commenting that Cronauer's humour ?is not funny at all'. Yet, at the end of the film, the comment by Cronauer is exactly what you want Dickerson to hear, as he has a really mean attitude problem, as told by his superior, General Taylor (Noble Willington).There is one surprising character in GMV, that of Trinh's younger brother Tuan (Tung Thanh Tran). For the majority of the film you believe that he is a good character, but as the film comes to a conclusion, and we learn who and what Tuan really is, and you can understand why Cronauer is a little peeved at person that he called ?friend'. There confrontation is one of the more dramatic and touching moments in the film. There are many other memorable moments in ?GMV'. I love how we are introduced to Cronauer, as we have no idea what sort of DJ he is or he is going to be. I also like the scene where Edward takes Adrian into the field, to see what a difference he has made to the troops who are serving in the war. Once again we get to see how funny-a-man Cronauer is. I must also make mention of the great soundtrack that was assembled for GMV. With Adrian playing such great rock 'n' roll hits as the Beach Boy's ?I get around' and ?Don't worry baby', the Searchers ?sugar and spice', Wilson Pickett's ?the midnight hour', James Brown's ?I got you (I feel good) and Louis Armstrong's classic hit ? What a wonderful world'. All these songs make the movie unforgettable and essentially what it is. So I really like this movie, not only for the classic radio scenarios that we are shown, but for how game the movie is in showing the dangers of war. In fact there is one scene in this movie that brings back memories of last October in Bali. I believe this is the good work of Barry Levinson and his team, who must have had a great time on the movie. I just wish I had watched this movie while trying desperately to become a radio DJ, because Adrian Cronauer makes the air waves look a lot of fun.

He knew the average age of the soldier was 19 so he played what they liked. He also treated the nationals like human beings. The most poignant scene was as he played Louis Armstrong singing 'Its a wonderful world" the screen was showing just the opposite- poverty, death and war.

This is a fine piece of entertainment and Robin Williams was probably never better in his role' as Adrian Croenaur. The casting is uniformly excellent with kudos going to the sadly departed Bruno Kirby as Lt. Steven Hauk and J.K. Walsh as Sgt. Maj. Dickerson.I've worked for many years in radio and the one issue which grates on me personally was how incredibly sloppily the actual scenes of Williams were handled while he was doing his broadcasts. I suppose Barry Levinson didn't think that it would matter to accurately depict a radio control room (or hoped no one would notice - but I did). Like: at no point in the film were the level meters indicating the sounds heard on the soundtrack. Yeah, they were moving, but not in synch with the sounds supposedly playing through the control board! There was one scene with a clear close-up of a tape recorder which was NOT running, yet the meters were merrily bouncing as if it was playing. Come ON, Barry!All that said, I am willing and able to look past that to see a great film with a great script and a great story. Do I recommend it? Sure!</fullReview>

I cannot separate this view of "Good Morning Vietnam" to the view of "a quiet American". Although, there were, maybe, less pictures of the countries in Good Morning Vietnam, I feel the atmosphere of Sai Gon better shown in this film. Photos of A quiet American were too clean, too nice.

		<fullReview>Robin Williams plays Adrian Cronauer, a real-life DJ stationed in Vietnam. He confronts authority and does what he can to defend the Vietnamese people, while befriending one man and trying to date his sister with moderate success. And then things go downhill.I can sum this movie up in one sentence: Robin Williams is not funny. The film is full of him ad-libbing voices where he's a homosexual, or a redneck or referencing people that were probably forgotten in 1987, and definitely today. He's decent as an actor when not trying to be funny, but every attempt at humor falls flat. To make matters worse, people in the background are literally falling out of their chairs with laughter... I don't think so.Forest Whitaker is in this, and plays more or less no role other than to follow Cronauer around and be a somewhat dim-witted sidekick who can't ride a bike or start a jeep properly. That's unfortunate that Whitaker was sidelined for Williams.You've most likely seen this film, as it has aired on television a million times in the past twenty years. I avoided it, and only came to view it by random happenstance. This was, as it turns out, a mistake, and I was right to avoid it. (Also, if you have any interest in real Vietnam War history, the actual Cronauer makes it clear that Williams did not portray him even remotely accurately.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing in this movie are the songs the DJ gives us. That DJ is funny man Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) and we are talking 1965, Vietnam. I didn't find him very funny, but I can understand if you think that he is. Although I didn't like the character, a man who really was a DJ in the Vietnam war, I admired Robin Williams. With a lot of improvising, may be sometimes trying to hard, he does a great job. My problem is that I only liked some of the jokes and, again, there is a good chance you will not have that problem.The story is mainly about Cronauer. How his superiors try to get rid of him but his co-workers like him, especially Montesque Garlick (Forest Whitaker), how he becomes friends with local boy Tuan (Tung Thanh Tran) and how he is in love with Tuan's sister Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana).It is all a little predictable. Example: Cronauer gets suspended and when they want him back he is not very willing. The sequence where he is convinced to go back, you will know which one I mean, is something that has to be in a movie like this. When you see the set-up you will predict the whole scene right.Again, I admired Robin Williams. The other performances are good as well. I loved the classic songs, I especially liked the sequence chosen during Louis Armstrong's What a Wonderful World, and of course the direction by Barry Levinson was pretty good. These things make this movie easy to watch, it doesn't get boring either, but I simply did not like it very much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the center of "Good Morning, Vietnam" is a man sitting at a radio microphone, performing a balancing act of uncommon delicacy as he teeters on the edge of madness and delivers the biggest laughs in the movie.That would be Bruno Kirby playing an obtusely square Army lieutenant who thinks he is actually a comedy cut-up. At one point in the film he gets his chance, after the much more successful DJ Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) has been pulled off the air for reading censored copy. Watching Kirby's Hauk character bug out when the other people at Armed Forces Radio Saigon beg him not to go on with his lame array of bizarre puns and French accents kills me every time I see this film."If it's not funny, why did I hear you laughing when you typed it?" Hauk demands of his aide."I was thinking of something else.""Good Morning, Vietnam" is Williams' movie, of course, and most of the attention is on him. It's his best film for distilling the essence of Williams' comedy in cinematic form, basically giving him a mike and letting him rip. Williams' material isn't his sharpest, but it has the feeling of being off-the-cuff (probably was a lot of the time) and for the most part is very specific to the time and place of the film, Saigon in 1965."Say, Mr. President, why did you name your daughter 'Lynda Byrd'?" "If I named her 'Lynda Dog' that would be too cruel."The film does best when it sticks to the radio station, with Hauk whining about not being saluted while Cronauer develops his on-air persona to the approval of the U.S. troops, then still in build-up mode. The scenes with the other radio guys (including Forest Whitaker, Robert Wuhl, Floyd Vivino, and Richard Portnow as the affable but deadly-dull jock Dan "The Man" Levitan) have an energy and authenticity that sell the realistic comedy director Barry Levinson is after.But like too many 1980s films, "Good Morning, Vietnam" suffers from an attempt to inject excitement and romance in crassly overt ways. So we have scenes where Cronauer woos a Vietnamese girl, befriends her brother, and tangles with the hard-case sergeant-major Dickerson (J. T. Walsh), whose homicidal hostility is neither developed nor well-explained. All this seems at the heart of the film's message, about the wrongness and destructiveness of war in general and this war in particular, yet the film doesn't need them.Proof of that comes in one scene where Cronauer, during a down moment, is pressed into delivering an impromptu stand-up for a bunch of troops about to ride into heavy battle. They laugh, and smile, and cheer, and in their nervous eyes and Williams' desperation to keep them entertained, you get about as strong an anti-war statement as you'd ever want to make.Too much of "Good Morning, Vietnam" is burdened by the other stuff for me to recommend it too heartily. But if you're a Robin Williams fan - or even more, a Bruno Kirby fan - who hasn't seen this film, you really want to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Williams vehicle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very entertaining if light Vietnam film concerning an irreverent, motor-mouthed DJ who falls in love with a local during the occupation. Robin Williams and Barry Levinson haven't simply set out to make a series of shock-jock set pieces; the film is also meant to weed out the humour of the fallacious period as well. Even this ends up as another stage for the Williams routine though - his first impromptu English lesson scene is hilarious.Naturally many of the scenes were improvised. Such a technique is very high-wire as, even if it comes off, there are no extra points for not using a script. Luckily Williams seems to find an extra energy by making things up which communicated itself on the screen. In support are a sort of latter-day brat pack: Forest Whitaker is particularly good as a browbeaten friend who can't help but laugh when the gags start coming. Bruno Kirby as Lieutenant Hauk is a dependable straight guy. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interpretation, spoilers: Two main struggles are woven together throughout this movie: the struggle between censorship and free speech and that regarding our role in Vietnam.The struggle with censorship ends in compromise. During his visit with the troops, Robin realizes that the happiness and morale of the troops is more important than voicing every bit of controversial news. Humorous satire and sarcasm are one thing, and even lighten the burden of the soldiers, but reading unofficial news of the sort he did was completely unnecessary. There is no point in scaring the soldiers by telling them of bombings in demilitarized when nothing can be done to alleviate the problem and only learned helplessness will result. But, the censored news could have saved Robin a lot of trouble at another point. Basically, in this conflict between oppressor and oppressee, rebellion for the sake of rebellion is pointless and counteractive - as demonstrated by the final address and every post-suspension show. Concerning the war itself a liberal position is taken. The human side of the Vietcong is shown, though secretly at first, and Robin shows his compassion for the enemy by risking his life in order to tell him of his death warrant. In order to make the liberal ideal come out less preachy, the young rebel himself proclaims it. Also, this leftistness is kept in check with Robin's chastisement over the bombings. Their intentions are well and good, but their actions are not. Perhaps it seems out of place to speak of these aspects of the movie in a comedy; I think they definitively outshadowed the comedic aspects. Though I was able to catch most of the war references, much of the musical references and era references were beyond me. So maybe my age was a factor, but it would have to be damn funny to overshadow the dramatic issues posed by the war. Overall, 6 of 10, somewhat entertaining from a educational perspective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful conmemoration of the hardships of Vietnam soldiers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie made me cry and laugh throughout! What soldiers in Vietnam faced was no picnic, and the man (such as the one the Robin Williams portrayed) who used his amazing facility of humor to brighten the lives of millions of young soldiers performed an act of altruism that ought to be remembered and admired. Robin Williams's character embodied what it meant to be American during Vietnam: stubbornly proud, a fighter, and an optimist even when all hope is lost. It is amazing how bringing a smile to someone's face can help them to carry on and in the case of a soldier, to not be so afraid and to try to forget about the possibility of death with every turn. Williams deserves so much praise for his perfectly timed shrewdness and witty humor and the life he ultimately brings to his character and to the entire picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Vietnam Comedy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to be hard on this film because of th idea of it. Good Morning Vietnam could have been a great drama, instead it was a "so so" comedy with a Robin Williams audience. Since about only 40% of this movie is fictional it is hard to give this movie any credit for being historically correct. Robin Williams is funny as always, still the movie plays both sides of the fence, most of the time, leaning on the anti-war side. Without Robin Williams, you have a story which is suppose to be a comedy about the Vietnam war. Hard to do, and without taste, if I may add. A nice movie, but far from anything timeless or terrific. Forest Whitaker continues to find work as he co-stars next to Williams. Always in deep though with a twitch to his giant neck, you can't really tell if Whitaker knows that he is being filmed...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Comedy Should Have Been Blacker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part I did enjoy GOOD MORNING VIETNAM but I can`t help feeling that it would have been a great film if there was a more cynical darker edge to the comedy with more lines like " You mean we should escalate the war so we can get bigger names ? " or Adrian Cronauer`s interview with the make believe intelligence officer . That said the scene with Adrian meeting and entertaining the young draftees going off to war is haunting just because it`s so understated while the montage of Vietnamese villages burning against the soundtrack of What A Wonderful World is intrusive because of its sledgehammer unsubtlety - And lets not forget Michael Moore made a career out of this scene . The cast are fairly good with Robin Williams giving one of his better in your face performances while Forest Whittaker plays his role in his usual affable likable way and Bruno Kirby is very memorable as Lt Hauk the laughably unfunny DJ .So a fairly good take on the Vietnam war from a different perspective , but I couldn`t help thinking it should have been to `Nam what MASH was to Korea</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The horror."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is but a reminder of how brilliantly funny Robin Williams once was. As a military dj, he is allowed to riff at will. Unfortunately, comedy's greatest daredevil is now working with a net. His improvisations are no longer improvisations; rather, they are simulations, a stock set of comic moves performed at break-neck speed (so as to give the impression of spontaneity). And Levinson's heavy-handed direction only makes matters worse. There are so many cut aways to listeners laughing their poor heads off that you can't help but feeling bullied ("YOU don't tell ME what's funny. I tell YOU what's funny."). This is an example of Ineffectual manipulation at its most extreme. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Robin Williams show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams is Adrian Cronauer! That is not only the basic gist of this movie it is what "Good Morning, Vietnam" relies upon entirely.This is indeed a manic, and quite funny, performance from Williams, who seems born to do this outrageous style of humour. The rest of the film is just background as we are treated to almost two hours of what many would call Mr. Williams ingenious ad-libbing."Good Morning, Vietnam" is very funny on first viewing, but fails to deliver the laughs a second time around. And if you do not like Robin Williams, please do yourself a favour.The film did also star Forest Whitaker, Bruno Kirby and J.T. Walsh.Saturday, September 12, 1992 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average film that will only get better if you really like Williams' hyper comedy and overacting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Vietnam demilitarised zone, the US troops are 'entertained' by the forces radio under the command of Sgt Maj Dickerson and 2nd Lt Hauk. Into the rather stale and censored station comes broadcaster Adrian Cronauer, who's impressions and crazy sense of humour immediately gets the support of the troops and becomes an instant hit. However his inability to follow orders causes major problems with his superiors; but things get worse as the Vietnam war starts to kick off with bombings and guerrilla warfare. Cronauer is forced to enter the reality of life in Vietnam and come out from behind his microphone.It has been many years since I saw this film and I remember laughing at it so much that I bought the soundtrack because it included snippets of Cronauer's radio broadcast. However then I was a young teenager and was maybe more of a Williams fan than I am now ? and here we have the crux of the film, if you love Robin Williams' style of stand up then you will enjoy this film but if you aren't won over by that then there is little else to win you over. The plot mostly trades on Cronauer upsetting his superiors before eventually getting into a final 30 minutes of 'oh, look, isn't war awful' that is delivered with such an obvious change of pace that. The film should have had this aspect running through it with a blacker vein of humour (a la M*A*S*H for example) and it would have been much better; as it is, it is more like an hour of a stand up show which then tries to be an affecting war story. It is OK but it didn't really work for me because I didn't find the jokes that funny and didn't appreciate the sudden reality check at the end.Williams tries really hard and I was surprised that I didn't laugh as much as I did ? maybe he never had time to get momentum up as his routines were edited all to hell and were delivered too fast. I have seen him in early stand up and found him hilarious so maybe it was a mix of delivery and material letting him down. The support cast is mostly pretty good and features some well known actors even if they don't all have that much to do.Whitaker has a good feel for the material and is nice enough; Kirby allows himself to be a fool; Wuhl is OK as a sort of comedy aside; Edson is OK and both Walsh and Willingham add clout in more serious roles. Tran and Sukapatana have much lesser roles and exist to carry the weight of the 'war is awful' message, they drift aimlessly enough for most of the film before getting to shout lots towards the end.Overall this is an OK film that rather averagely delivers comedy and a 'war is hell' message, but it was a problem for me that it seemed to deliver these is two different strands rather than being successfully mixed together. If you are a big Robin Williams fan then you should like this as his manic stand up personae gets a good run here but I imagine many viewers will feel that the 'message' is rather thrust onto them. Worth a look but there are much better wartime comedies that are darker, funnier and much more intelligent than this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Morning, Vietnam is a disgustingly clichéd movie from beginning to end. Of course there is not the slightest bit of criticism on the war itself. Only on the way the executives handled the situation. I was left utterly exasperated after having seen this.The only likable character in the entire movie was the Vietnamese boy who turned out to be a member of the Vietcong. If I would be facing such ignorance I would be tempted to do the same. For I definitely had a deep desire to punch all the other characters in the face, especially on the American side.This movie is an insult and shows perfectly well the haughtiness America is criticised for in the rest of the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Williams runs at the mouth in this over serious comedy. Rude and crude, and insulting over humorous dialog. Maybe, Andrew Dice Clay could do better. Over rated, his comic bit, like in a club, sounds more like a tirade at the post office than humor. No Caddy Shack, with the cholate bar in the pool humor. Instead, the movie reminds me more of insults at work. The ending is serious, and one needs to see a comedy after watching this film. 4/10</fullReview>
