		<shortDescription>Capra at his best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For film-goers and movie fans that are from my generation, it is easy for these films to get lost in the shuffle. Ask someone my age, who would now be 25, what the best movie of all time is, they're likely to say Pulp Fiction or Fight Club.Not to take away from today's movies, but for anyone who has not gone back and viewed classic Capra, such as "You Can't Take it With You," then they are truly missing out.This movie is pure magic and beauty. Lionel Barrymore gives a performance as relevant in 2005 as it was in 1938. And what can you say about Jimmy Stewart?? This is a rare gem of a film and in true Capra fashion, the climactic final scene brings tear to the eye, much the same way as Harry Bailey's toast in "It's a Wonderful Life."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take a large free-spirited family without visible means of support. Add a large mean-spirited tycoon intent on taking over their neighborhood. Mix in a romance between their daughter &amp; his son. Sprinkle with zaniness &amp; bake for two hours. Enjoy while hot.This is one of those big comedy productions with a huge cast that only someone like Frank Capra could have pulled off. That he did so, winning the 1938 Best Picture Oscar, is immensely to his credit.Hobbling on the crutches that signaled the crippling arthritis that would soon confine him to a wheelchair, Lionel Barrymore is the focal point of the film as the grandfather of a wacky clan that believes in doing whatever makes them happy. So they dance, make fireworks, bake candy, paint, write novels, and construct toys with equal joy - laughing through the Depression with much love &amp; great contentment. Jean Arthur, James Stewart &amp; Edward Arnold co-star, with a mammoth cast of supporting players.This is the movie for viewers who want to feel warm &amp; safe &amp; cuddled &amp; protected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Always *Is* A Wonderful Life...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't exactly call YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU (YCTIWY) Capra's forgotten movie--after all, it *did* win the Best Picture Oscar in its year. And I *have* heard of this film by word of mouth previously, though perhaps not as frequently or with as much ubiquity as some of Capra's other films. Compared to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, for example, YCTIWY distinctly has the status of a 'minor classic'. I don't believe this is deserved, even if themes and (co-)stars are shared between these movies: YCTIWY should definitely be far better known and remembered than it actually is.First of all, the story-telling is flawless. It very cleverly sets up the two very different families, the Vanderhof/Sycamores (an offbeat family trading most importantly in happiness) and the Kirbys (a stiff up tight banking family trading mostly in weapons). To complete the biggest deal of his career, Anthony Kirby Sr (Edward Arnold) must buy up the last house in a neighbourhood, and of course, this house belongs to Martin Vanderhof (a delightful Lionel Barrymore). The movie pleasantly surprised me in *not* having young Tony Kirby (James Stewart) be assigned to get Vanderhof to sell his house and thereby falling in love with Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur) and her zany family. Rather, he was in love with her to begin with, and loved her regardless of what he thought of her family. (Though it would be impossible to hate any of them, I feel!) The story really is simple: Tony loves Alice no matter what, and doesn't want her or her family to put on a show to impress his own family. When he surprises her by turning up a day early for a dinner engagement, the Kirbys meet the Vanderhof/Sycamores for who they truly are, wind up in jail, and along the way, learn a little bit about being real human beings. There are several delightful scenes in the film as well, all beautifully filmed and connected such that the story is a coherent whole. I'm especially partial to practically any scene with James Stewart wooing Jean Arthur (those two, quite seriously, make the cutest couple imaginable)--I love it when he sort of proposes to her. "Scratch hard enough and you'll find a proposal." Or that lovely intimate scene in the park where he directs her to a seat like he would at the ballet, or when they start dancing with the neighbourhood children. The scene in the restaurant was also amusing, when Tony kept warning Alice that there was a scream on the way, building it up so perfectly that *she* wound up screaming before he did. It's hard to beat the scene in night court too, when Capra foreshadows pretty much the exact same scene and sentiment in the forthcoming IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, when all of Vanderhof's friends chip in to pay off his fine. It's sweet, it's real, and it's something you really do wish could still happen in this world. Even the littlest things like Grandpa Vanderhof's dinnertime prayers are enough to remind the viewer of what a world could be like if we kept our values simple, our wants satisfied, and ourselves happy.Second of all, the acting is superlative. How could it *not* be, with a cast like this? Evidently I was completely charmed by James Stewart and Jean Arthur, who are both incredibly believable both as real people and movie stars, and who together make Tony and Alice an utterly credible, true-to-life couple. Edward Arnold was great as the stuffed shirt Anthony Kirby Sr too--his eventual 'thawing' was something that could easily have been played in too exaggerated a fashion, but both the actor and director, I suspect, are too good to have allowed that to happen. I also had great fun watching Ann Miller in her secondary role as Essie Sycamore, Alice's dancing sister. I sincerely hope that every person making this film had just as much fun as I did watching it, because the whole secondary cast was excellent, and I loved all the characters we were introduced to, particularly the entire Sycamore family with their attendant friends (the ex-iceman DePinna, or the toymaker Poppins) and even their servants Rheba and Donald, who were treated almost as much as part of the family as could be expected at that time. But my greatest praise would have to be reserved for Lionel Barrymore as Martin Vanderhof--a sweeter, lovelier old man you just couldn't imagine, and a complete change from his much-better-known Mr. Potter in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. He really does make Grandpa Vanderhof very much a real person, from his reminiscences about Grandma Vanderhof, to his messing around with the IRS agent, to his harmonica-playing and evident love of life and people. I really could not say enough good things about this movie (which I prefer to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE). It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and quite frankly, it'll make you glad to be alive. Not many movies can do that. And it's most certainly true that you can't take your money with you... but what you *can* do is take this movie and its message to heart. 10/10, without a doubt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not the play. This is better.The madcap adventures of a crazy family during the depression is a life affirming film that shows us that money isn't everything and that yes, you can't take it with you.One of the joys of this film is the cast Lionel Barrymore, Jimmy Stewart, Ann Miller, Dub Taylor, Edward Arnold, Eddie Rochester Anderson, Misha Auer and just about every great supporting actor and actress under the sun, all acting completely and wonderfully mad. They sell the story and make you smile from ear to ear.I can't be rational where this film is concerned.Just see it.You'll feel good for days.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edward Arnold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among all the enthusiastic reviews for this movie, it is hard to find a sufficiency of praise for the work of Edward Arnold. A familiar face on the screen in the thirties and forties, with his round face, solid body, and trademark pince-nez, Arnold surpasses himself in this filmToo often type-cast as a plutocrat, Arnold nevertheless demonstrates nuance and sensitivity as a man who, despite many flaws and faults, is redeemed by his love for his son. Arnold is seldom credited with the subtlety and poignancy of his characterizations, probably because he generally played greedy capitalists in a time when greedy capitalists were even more frightening than they are (and properly so) now, but this is an omission that should be corrected. His characterization in this comedy is a powerful performance, and grossly under-appreciated. He was one of the masters of American cinematic acting, with never a false note on his performances, and it is shameful that he is not so acknowledged.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You Can't Take It With You won for Best Picture of 1938 and got Frank Capra his third Oscar for Best Director. Looking at it now it is firmly anchored in the decade that spawned it and the Oscar is a tribute to authors Kaufman and Hart and their popularity in that time. You Can't Take It With You came off a Broadway run of 838 performances for the 1936-1938 Broadway seasons. It's a tale of two men and their families. Edward Arnold plays Anthony Kirby millionaire banker and industrialist who is obsessed with both making money and his social position, though the latter is more in deference to his snooty wife Mary Forbes. Their son James Stewart is preparing uneasily to step into his father's world. What really is Stewart's main interest is the romance he's got going with the only normal member of that other family, Jean Arthur.Her grandfather is the second man with a family. A very extended family that all lives under one roof because that's how Lionel Barrymore as Grandpa Vanderhof likes it. He's got a daughter who writes unpublished plays, a son-in-law who likes to experiment with fireworks, a granddaughter who aspires to be a ballerina, her husband who is a xylophone virtuoso and an iceman who was so taken with the house he just quit his job and stayed there. I can't really blame Halliwell Hobbes the iceman. If I was being supported by Jean Arthur's salary as a secretary and Lionel Barrymore's investments, I'd quit working myself.In fact I can understand Barrymore's sentiments. I had an opportunity to retire early myself and took it and don't regret it. Of course I'm not supporting a whole extended family either. Let Sanuel S. Hinds, Spring Byington, Ann Miller, and Dub Taylor go out and earn a little and then become bohemians.Both Arnold and Barrymore are extreme in their philosophy and the play and film are weighed heavily in Barrymore's balance. But looking at it objectively, Barrymore has a more realistic outlook for most people. There are a couple of dinner scenes at the Vanderhof house and it looks like quite a feed. Who's paying for it?This was James Stewart's first and Jean Arthur's second film with Frank Capra. Next year they would do their second and last in the much acclaimed Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. In doing the screen adaptation, Capra and screenwriter Robert Riskin created a whole new character in Mr. Poppins played by Donald Meek. Poppins is an inoffensive little bureaucrat who would rather make little toys than add columns of figures all day. One meeting with Lionel Barrymore persuades Donald Meek to follow his dream. He blended so well into the Vanderhof household that Kaufman and Hart praised his creation.Though You Can't Take It With You is dated it is still funny as all get out. And you haven't lived until you've heard Brahm's Hungarian Dance Number 5 done as a xylophone solo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious and entertaining Capra classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You Can't Take it With You is a very funny and entertaining film. Bringing Up Baby is probably the only film that has ever made me laugh as hard as this one. James Stewart and Jean Arthur are magical together, just as they were in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. This is yet another great film by Frank Capra and was rewarded with an Oscar for Best Picture in 1938.Stewart comes from a rich and completely uptight family. Miss Arthur is the only relatively sane member of a very wild family. Lionel Barrymore is wonderful as the grandfather here. He is so warm and funny in this movie, it's hard to believe he's the same man who played the evil Mr. Potter in It's A Wonderful Life. Edward Arnold who was known for playing slimy villians, is great as Stewart's very wealthy and totally stuck-up father.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't worry, be happy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Kaufman and Moss Hart, the playwrights of the original play in which this film is based, seemed to have been keenly aware that most people in their pursuit of wealth and success in life basically forget the most important point of all: To live life to its fullest, enjoying every minute of it and sharing with loved ones and friends everything, good, or bad."You Can't Take it with You" is an enormously satisfying theater play, which must have drawn Frank Capra's attention to bring it to the movies. In fact, it meshes well with most of his films, in that this is a film with a social conscience, after all. The screen play by Robert Riskin has some awkward moments, but the finished product proves that Mr. Capra could turn any script into a movie with great success. While this film is not in the same league as his other masterpieces, it is still a good way to spend some time with good company.Much has been said in this forum about the merits of YCTIWY. The cast of this film is Hollywood at its best. Lionel Barrymore makes a great contribution with his Martin Vanderhof, the patriarch of the crazy household where happiness lives. Vanderhof's life is full because of his family and the friends he welcomes to share whatever he has, asking nothing in return. He is a rich man, indeed.By contrast, Anthony Kirby, the Wall Street millionaire, is a miserable human being. His whole aim in life is to amass a fortune that he will not be able to spend at all. He is reminded by Vanderhof that his life is worth nothing because he has no friends. Edward Arnold does wonders portraying this unhappy man, in perhaps, the best performance of his long film career. Mr. Arnold was a great actor.The other notable character in the film is Alice Sycamore, the young secretary that happens to fall in love with the rich Kirby heir. In fact, she has the pivotal role of telling off the father of the man she loves because she sees the older Kirby for what he really stands. As Alice, the wonderful Jean Arthur takes the role and makes a splash with it.James Stewart has a minor role in this film, in comparison to the above mentioned ones. Ann Miller is charming as the happy would be ballerina Essie. Spring Byington makes a great Penny, the woman who can write plays in the middle of all the confusion going on in the Vanderhof household. There is a small scene where the incomparable Charles Lane, an actor that has been seen in innumerable films in minor roles, who plays a tax collector. The rest of the cast is excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite american director is Frank Capra."It Happened One Night" is his first great film."Mr.Deeds Goes To Town","Mr.Smith Goes To Washington" and "Meet John Doe" are perfect examples of how to make a great film about simple,ordinary man."It's A Wonderful Life" is everybody's favorite holiday film.But "You Can't Take It With You" is Capra's masterpiece.The story is perfect,The direction is brilliant and it's impossible you don't get tears in your eyes with the sweetness and shear simplicity of Martin Vanderhof.That leads us to the best thing in this classic:Lionel Barrymore,one of the greatests actors in film history.All you have to do is see this film and "It's a Wonderful Life" and see for yourselfs.Mr.Potter is cruel,heartless,despicable and absolute fascinating(I still can't believe it ranked only 6 in the AFI list,because for me he's the greatest villain in film history)All Mr.Potter lack,Martin Vanderhof has to share.He is absolutely adorable,he has a lot of friends.(The scene in the court room is magnificent)he is sweet,and equally fascinating.(Not to mention that Lionel is really gorgeous in this film)One must remember the shining presence of Jean Arthur,and equally portrayal of good and young Jimmy Stewart.Not to forget Edward Arnold and his greedy Anthony P. Kirby,who tries at all costs to buy Grandpa's house.But Lionel teaches him in a marvelous harmonica duet,how to enjoy life.The Plot is simply and delightul.Jean is Lionel's granddaughter,and she loves Jimmy Stewart,who is the son of the blood sucking banker Arnold.Jean decided that the two family's shall met,But Stewart's family will have a shock when they meet the wonderful and very eccentric Vanderhof family with Lionel,the grandfather anyone would love to have,Spring Byington as the writing mother(Only because someone forgot a typing writer in her house)Ann Miller as the adorable dancing sister,Essie,and a very funny Mischa Auer as the russian dancing teacher,who always arrives just in time for dinner.Pay also attencion in a small but memorable perfomance of the forgotten silent actor H.B.Warner as the broken Mr.Ramsey.I believe I already say to much,but not all this site will be enough to say what this masterpiece and Martin Vanderhof means to meMy Rate:1000 Out Of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely satisfying Capra!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One message. "Nothing is worth doing if you can't enjoy it, and when it's over- you can't take it with you!"Do any of Capra's works actually speak 'that' one particular message? Perhaps the closest to the above is "It Happened One Night". "Lost Horizon" is about rediscovery and peace of mind. "Mr Smith" is politically and small town oriented and "Mr Deeds" deals with the same except without some political yawn. George Bailey should have had a better dosage of the "You Can't Take it With You" policy in "It's a Wonderful Life".Here is a play that exercises Frank Capra's famous adage with all humour already built in. Why shouldn't it work? The stage version was a phenomenal success, written superbly by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. If their story is slightly lacking, look no further than the delightful cast of characters. Mr Poppins, toy and mask maker. Alice's Father who meddles with fireworks. Essie the ballerina, Penny the playwright and the wonderful Russian ballet teacher. The uptight Kirby banking corporation. Then there's the "Mr Smith" duo, Tony (Jimmy Stewart) and Alice (Jean Arthur). The stand out performer here, is naturally the lovable Lionel Barrymore as Grandpa Vanderfhoff. Although the first film in which the damaging effects of his arthritis began to show, Capra had his leg put in a cast and had him move around on crutches. He relishes his performance. I have heard of complaints which discuss the fact this film fails to address corruption and greed in a similar manner to "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" which successfully played its part going against the American capital. Once again, Capra emphasises his favourite theme of the little guy up against the world and succeeds, but "You Can't Take it With You" basically does not even make a mild attempt to criticise the American system of government, past or present, even though I know very little about it. On different levels, look at this film in the light of discussing heavier issues, as the aforementioned greed and corruption. I just don't think Mr Capra would have liked it as much for one of his works to be remembered like that, especially with the basic message staring at us right in the face. Nevertheless, it is another of Capra's life saving feel good movies. All it is encouraging us to do is to have a little fun. Rating: 8/10</fullReview>

Like other would-be-likers, I kept hanging in there, fighting sleep; waiting to laugh, to cry, to stay awake. I groaned and grabbed the remote when Gramps talked whatever his name was to join along and play the harmonica. Good God! And there was that twit dancing dancing dancing...and the wrestling Russian and the black couple dancin' and every other hokey junk Capra could throw in! I couldn't even hear Jean Arthur, she talked so low and ducked her face behind her hair so often I can only conclude she was hoping to avoid any association with this stinker.To say this movie insults one's intelligence is a compliment. It attempts to tug at your heartstrings so much that it chokes you with them.Do yourself a favor, replay "It's a Wonderful Life" instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's face it--time has not been kind to this one.YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU is played so broadly and written with such simplistic and obvious platitudes coming from the mouths of its cast, that I can't possibly see why the Academy voted it Best Picture of 1938. After all, everyone knows money isn't everything.Today, whatever charm it may have had has dimmed very much over the years and it appears more dated and foolish than ever. The household of eccentric bohemians are supposed to be wildly funny, but instead they become more than mildly annoying, especially when they have anything to say--which, unfortunately, is quite often. As is often the case when a film is based on a stage play, there is too much fast paced dialog going on at almost any given moment.Not even stars like JEAN ARTHUR and JAMES STEWART can overcome this sort of Capra-corn which is so thick you could cut it with a pocketknife. You have to be in a mood to watch this, willing to suspend all belief in reality and succumb to the notion that doing nothing for a living is better than having an honest job or worrying about the rent. So simplistic are the messages trying to get through that it becomes clear we are just supposed to sit back and watch the shenanigans of a bunch of eccentrics play out to a silly and predictable conclusion.In a year that included such standouts as THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, considered a classic piece of cinema entertainment in gorgeous three-strip technicolor, it's sad to learn that Capra's stagey comedy, hammed up by a large cast that plays the comedy for sledgehammer delivery, was the winner in 1938. Furthermore, most of the unrestored prints available today are not easy to view, with a muffled soundtrack and dark prints.Whatever social significance the Academy found in this one is buried under tons of broad characterizations and contrived situations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ts easy to be cynical and sneering at this film... so I will be. The supposedly happy, carefree family in this film consists of old men who make fireworks in their cellar, a woman who dances everywhere instead of walking and a patriarch who never gets cross and doesn't stop dishing out fortune cookie advice. They also carry musical instruments and break out into song whenever the mood takes them, even in a prison. Capra wants us to think that these nutcases, because they do whatever they please and spend so much time together rather than accumulate money, are living a perfect life. If such a bohemian philosophy leaves you dirt poor and acting like a bunch of escaped mental patients, then get me a job as a 9-to-5 bank clerk pronto.If you disagree with the central premise, then you really have no room to maneuver. I suffered through scene after scene of sappy speeches and events pertaining to the views of Mr Capra, each one more tiresome than the last. Rich = Unhappy and no idea of community. Poor = Salt of the earth and always there for each other. What a crock. Capra's other films may have extolled the same virtues, but at least they didn't ram them down our throats. And they had the added advantage of having non-annoying characters and well thought out plots. Watching this is was for me akin to listening to a lecture by a BNP representative... I don't agree with your opinions, and that's all you have to offer. So... I quit. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life", so it pains me to admit that this film is a flop. It has high ideals, but is ultimately contrived and simplistic at the same time. The movie hinges on the notion that having money is less important than having friends (ala Wonderful Life), but gets a little to black and white with the characterizations - deep down, the wealthy folks are miserable people, and the poor and middle class are noble citizens. Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur have great chemistry, and there are some nice moments between them, but it all sort of gets lost in this heavy-handed morality play.</fullReview>

Despite the differences between the film and stage versions(number of roles, locations of 'new' scenes, etc.), it never does one harm to try and see both whenever one has the chance. Better yet, if some local group is producing the play, you should jump at the chance to become a part of this great American work.Contrary to many peoples belief that it goes against the ethic of hard work, this film,(and play),encourages a person to seek out and find what they do well and do it to the best of their ability. As life WILL sometimes imitate art, I've gotten into some good "discussions" with folks about Grandpas way of thinking.By all means, purchase this film, see the play, and learn from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched this a couple of times, always hoping this time would be an improvement over the last. It hasn't worked. I hate saying that. Not just because there is so much talent invested in what appears to me to be a relative failure -- play by Kaufman and Hart, screenplay by Morrie Riskind, directed by Frank Capra, a cast including Jimmy Stewart, Jean Arthur, and a host of other accomplished performers -- but because my not being able to enjoy it as much as I properly should deprives me of smiles and laughter that there are times I desperately need.Basically, Jimmy Stewart is the scion of a -- well, a not merely "rich" family, but an immensely wealthy family able to spend a quarter of a million 1939 dollars a year on lawyers alone. They're humorless, driven, and arid. All except Jimmy, who falls in love with his peppy blond secretary, Jean Arthur.She's normal, but her family and their friends are outlandish. A visit to their household is like a child's fantasy of a mad house. There is the cheerful, tolerant patriarch, Lionel Barrymore, who hasn't paid income taxes in 20 years because he doesn't want to own any battleships. There is his daughter, Ann Miller, imitating a clumsy would-be ballerina who, under the tutelage of her lunatic Russian instructor, dances wildly to Hungarian dances played prestissimo on a wooden xylophone by her sulky husband. One old man poses as a discus thrower for a lousy painter. Another builds fireworks in the basement, which we know are bound to explode sooner or later.It all sounds hilarious, and it must have been a considerable success on the stage. I understand there were a number of changes in the adaptation designed to introduce "serious" ideas into the story.Yet, it comes across as thoroughly schematic. The peasants are lively, spiritual, loved by their neighbors, generous, proud of their independence. Their goal is to "have fun." The rich are materialistic and emotionally bankrupt. Until the predictable end, when they are converted to the First Church of Epicurus and its pursuit of ataraxia.If you haven't seen it before, you might not want these comments to discourage you. Evidently a lot of people have gotten more out of it than I have. Maybe I've mistaken profundity for silliness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What, and I mean, WHAT the heck happens at the end there? You have got to be kidding me! I can't believe this won Best Picture, let alone being held up as a classic still today.Edward Arnold's moral reversal is telegraphed so far in advance you swat your forehead in amazement at how unsophisticated audiences must have been back then. And then his old rival literally haunting him before closing the big deal? And then the guy dies! The perpetuation of "money can't buy happiness" is so tritely bludgeoned into our heads (the audience) you wonder whether there was ever any room for nuance.I really enjoyed the way this movie starts. In fact, I thought I was waiting for another Hollywood screwball classic, only with a little more heart and a little less slapstick to go around. Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur are a total delight, their chemistry is absolutely authentic and invigorating. It's when old man Barrymore keeps peppering this over-salted ham of a movie with his optimism and joie de vivre that you want to jam a fork in a toaster just to make the brow beating end.Some films are dated so poorly you can barely stomach them. The house staff is a particularly ugly reminder of black stereotypes perpetuated in Hollywood. I noticed after a while that neither of the two black actors spoke a line of dialogue without a white actor in the frame.Some of the shortcomings of this film are the dated message, for which you really can't blame it. But the real problem is the 3rd act nosedive. It spends the first two acts building a mannered, satiric social comedy only to see it literally blown sky high in exchange for maudlin monologues about harmonicas and the little people.I've heard of Capra-corn, but come on. What did this beat to win Best Picture? Errol Flynn's Robin Hood and Renoir's Grand Illusion! This should be taught in film school as the classic example of how not to end a movie. Shame, it had so much going for it for the first two thirds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for all tastes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of praise for this movie and assumed it would be good; after all, I love James Stewart, I love romantic comedies, everyone else seems to love it, so how can it possibly go wrong? It can. It did. I had to force myself to sit through the entire movie, hoping it would get better. The message of the story is something akin to the more commonly known "A Christmas Carol". Unfortunately, where "A Christmas Carol" was an easily enjoyable read with a moral to it, this movie was a moral forced into the form of a romantic comedy. What it lacked in subtlety must have been made up for in something, but I can't exactly imagine it was the comedy or the romance.Where I should have loathed Kirby parents, I found myself feeling pity for the most part. The story at parts was so blatantly one-sided... even though Alice Sycamore's entire family enjoyed themselves and did only what they wanted (to a such a degree that was even illegal), there was no real consequence and no real lesson on their part learned. They may have been, in part, in the wrong, but they're still not in the wrong. This makes no sense, but whatever. It's not meant to make sense, it's comedy - so goes the excuse. The house should have burnt down when the fireworks in the basement went off, there should have been a more extreme fine and the revolutionary pamphlets were completely forgotten about after the single mention.Kirby Sr. eventually does make a bit of a change because of the ordeal he goes through (and in my opinion it was an ordeal. For me if not for him!), but there is no real change to Alice's family (whom I spent most of the movie wishing would end up in jail if not for their illegal activities, then for their unwarranted obnoxiousness). It was good to see the older Kirbys end up in jail, but the whole manner of it and the way things went made me feel very sorry for Mr. Kirby even as the moral of the story was repeatedly being thrown about by the dialog. Okay, we get it... rich, selfish, stuck up banker will die friendless and alone if he doesn't change - got it, can we move on yet? Apparently not.The comedic parts were more obnoxious than humorous, or was of such a humor I couldn't enjoy it even for the romantic parts, which I actually felt were decent.Overall, the sense of humor wasn't great, the "villains" weren't anything to be awed about (honestly, even in comedy I don't want to be caught dead feeling sorry for a villain), and there was a lack of reality that even comedy can't cure. As a comedy, it might fly for a lot of people, but to me it's a near total failure.Recommended for: people who can ignore reality and absolutely hate rich bankers so much they willingly side with eccentric old men who refuse point-blank to pay taxes. If you can get past those things, which I could not and shouldn't be forced to, then go ahead, by all means... maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did. Maybe.Rating: 3 out of 10 because that's about as much enjoyment as I got out of it (though that's me being generous, I'm afraid, it was more like a 2 out of 10, but the popcorn was good...).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Dated, It Can Be Painful To Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's another film that just doesn't date well but, hey, it's almost 70 years old. I have found most of the comedies (the Marx Brothers are an exception) of that time period aren't very funny these days. Humor has changed a lot.There is a crazy family in this film and these crackpots are pretty humorous the first time you see them, in their first scene, but not the subsequent ones. They only get more and more annoying as you hear them.The romance between Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur is sappy and bogs down the film. How they advertise that Arthur is the beautiful lead female romantic in here amazes me. She was talented actress but "beautiful" or "glamorous?" Hardly, plus she had an awful voice. She does better as a comedienne or straight dramatic actress than playing the "beautiful romantic" as one known national critic labeled her. Maybe it is just this film because normally I like Arthur, but she's awful in here.When you add Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold, Micha Auer and Spring Byington and have the famous Frank Capra directing, you would think this is going to be topnotch, but the movie is anything but impressive or entertaining, especially now in this day-and-age. In fact, many parts of this story have such an absence of credibility to them that you'll cringe watching. With the big awards it won, I expected a better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd always heard about this film, and when it came on Turner classic was delighed to catch it. It wasn't what I expected. The acting was wonderful, particularly James Stewart, giving a subtle and powerful performance. Many of the supporting characters were finely drawn. However, the film simply wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. It was a sweet romantic comedy (light on the comedy. In fact, I was surprised how many scenes in the film weren't even attempting to be funny (the film had too many speeches with hit-you-over-the-head messages). I enjoyed this film. But I am surprised it even got nominated for best picture, let alone won. If not for winning the award, I think it would be all but forgotten today, and it is pretty forgotten for a best picture winner.</fullReview>

The blame for this mess goes to Capra, who obviously had no confidence in the original script...nor in the legacy this play created when it opened in 1936 to this very day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film sure is chaotic all right!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are generally 2 types of people in this world; those who consider Frank Capra to be a genius filmmaker, and those who views him as a complete hypocrite powdered with too much sentimentality. I seem to be an exception to this rule in that I see things as they are. But one thing seems to bring everyone to agreement: You Can't Take It With You is not a good movie under any circumstances.So what is the story behind this film? As cartoony as it sounds today, it's actually about a man who gets engaged to a woman from an anarchist family following the advice from his rich, greedy father who wants their lot for themselves. The only problem is that they are a household of crazy nihilists that sees money as valueless, and cares only about living a good, fun life, because as the movie repeatedly tells us (even in the title), 'You Can't Take It With You.' That is kinda a good theme to go for, and let's face it, it's very much true, but do we really need a movie to tell us this? The theme is not that significant and it is, for the most part, common sense. The problem here though, is that the film literally criticizes those that seek profits and contrary to what the family tells us, money has value in the world, and it is important. Not only does the family borderline hates money and criticizes those that makes it, but the loony residents are supposed to be the sound mind that we are to side with (the irony is that the real world looks sane to us, but not to them. Ha. Ha. Ha.).There are a few good things going for it though; the acting is all around good (the irony that Lionel Barrymore's the hero in this film, and would go on to play Mr. Potter in It's A Wonderful Life, another Capra film). It is amusing seeing the crazy antics of that particular household too. And it makes a sound argument against the Income Tax; in a better movie, this would probably have left a significant impact on our nation. But as is, it just reached out to us without leaving a dent in the Income Tax laws in the least.So yeah, I personally didn't like this one either, and even for back then, the fact that it won Best Picture and Best Director (the film's sole wins) was considered an upset. There's very little reason for me or anyone else to recommend this film other than the possible hardcore film buff or, less likely, the most hardcore of Capra fans. At a ranking of 4 out of 10, this is film is a chaotic mess I would personally stay away from.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well deserving of its Best Picture status, this took a while to settle in for me, but once it did I really enjoyed it. Delightful and very funny at times, but it also makes you think about what you're doing in life. How free-spirited it would be if we could all heed the advice of Lionel Barrymore in the film and simply walk away from our humdrum jobs and responsibilities. Alas, in reality we must get around to paying our bills and putting food on the table. But it's still a nice dream and it's a pleasure to be carefree for two hours while watching this wonderful movie. James Stewart was fine in this picture, but he didn't really figure that prominently in it; I was much more interested in the Lionel Barrymore grandfather who long ago decided to have some fun in life and leave everything else behind, and Stewart's stuffy old rich father (well played by Edward Arnold), who eventually learns that money really means nothing in the end. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

Lionel Barrymore is excruciatingly annoying as the wise patriarch, forever spouting phony wisdoms so that when the villain, Mr. Evil Capitalist banker, finally tells him to get off his soap-box I felt like kissing him on the noggin. You Can't Take It With You is a movie that flaunts its seeming na?veté, but cannot disguise it's inner cynicism: it panders to the preconcieved notions of its depression era-audience about the virtues of poor folk and the evils of rich men and large corporations, whilst being made by a rich man working for a large corporation. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington", though replete with exaggeratedly patriotic idealism and sharing the white hat/black hat dualism of contemporary westerns, worked perfectly well because at its core it painted a true picture of government's susceptibility to corruption, a picture that rings even truer today than when the picture was made. It also boasted a script that had some real dramatic tension, beautifully carried out by Jimmy Stewart.However, this effort, released just a year earlier, tries to hang the same ideals - faceless, heartless, and greedy corporate (as opposed to governmental in "Mr. Smith") anonymity versus the charming goodness of "little folks" - on much shakier plot devices. The quirkiness of the Vanderhof/Sycamore household is totally contrived, and the aristocratic snottiness of the Kirbys is drawn with an absurdly broad brush. Jimmy Stewart, who carried "Mr. Smith", has much less to do here and does it much less effectively. The whole thing just doesn't ring true enough to give us any sense of sympathy at the final resolution. As an aside, note how the Judge, wonderfully played by Harry Davenport, foreshadows the role of the Senate President in "Mr. Smith", even to the odd way he rests his head against his right hand as he surveys the chaotic chamber before him with resigned bemusement. Too similar to be done other than intentionally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a time where It's a Wonderful Life is known now as one of the greatest films of all time, I think a lot of people forget about the greatness that is, You Can't Take it With You. Capra's films often deal a lot with the essence of community and family that trumps all. This film does just that and does it to perfection.It stars James Stewart but the entire cast is incredible. Stewart is very young and in the early stages of his career so the rest of the actors really nail each and every scene they are in. In particular, Lionel Barrymore has about as good as of a performance you can have and the entire Vanderhof family gets their time to shine. Much like It's a Wonderful Life, this film is not only very enjoyable, but it's highly re-watchable. Capra does a great job of directing his actors to some of their best performances of their career, along with creating a unique household full of what is probably one of my favorite families in film history. Everyone loves the Vanderhof's, and so do I.The film is very light hearted and I can understand if people think it could be corny, much like It's a Wonderful Life, but I don't think there's anything wrong with having a story that everyone can enjoy. It's the classic tale of Romeo and Juliet/Cinderella but it's told and structured in a unique way that really hits home. It's a predictable but really sweet script that plays out just that way on screen. I love everything about You Can't Take it With You.+Sweet story+Everyone in the family is interesting+Twist on the R&amp;J story+Barrymore carries the film10/10</fullReview>

And that sensibility you expect will certainly be evident here. This is like a cross between his "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Arsenic and Old Lace". The eccentric scenes are great, with dancing and music for no real reason. There is a discussion of income taxes and what good they serve. (Keep in mind income tax started around 1913, so people of the time knew an era without it.) And best of all, we have a rat. A rat with hair on it. That cracked me up pretty hard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A stenographer (Jean Arthur) from a family of free spirits and a bank vice-president (James Stewart) from a wealthy family fall in love. But the different lifestyles of the two families comes between the couple after a crazy night where everything that can go wrong does.A sheer delight from one of the legendary directors of yesteryear. This is the first of three collaborations between Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart. I doubt I have to tell anybody what the other two were since they're well-known classics. Well this one deserves wider praise because it's simply magical. The four leads are all perfect. Stewart and Arthur have amazing chemistry that they would repeat the following year in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. But perhaps the real stars of the show are Edward Arnold and Lionel Barrymore as the respective patriarchs of the two families. Two immensely talented actors that never gave a bad performance (that I've seen). You always get your money and time's worth with these two. As with Stewart and Arthur, both of these gentlemen would return for future Capra classics. Aside from the four stars, we have great support from Donald Meek, Spring Byington, Samuel S. Hinds, Mischa Auer, a 15 year-old Ann Miller, Halliwell Hobbes, and Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson. Dub Taylor also makes his film debut here. What a cast! It's one of those films, like Sullivan's Travels or Lady for a Day, that just gets better and better each time I see it. The first time I saw it was probably close to twenty years ago. I liked it then but I love it now. This movie leaves a huge smile on my face and I think, unless you're an extreme cynical type, it will do the same for you. It's a warm, uplifting comedy with romance, drama, and lots of little bits for people who like "windows into the past." Just a real treat for anyone who loves getting lost in classic films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most understated Best Picture winners, taking a modest Picture and Director pair, which was Frank Capra's third. It's generally considered that the award didn't mean much until the following year with Gone With The Wind, with It Happened One Night as an exception example. Capra was the president of the Academy and all. Nevertheless, You Can't Take It With You is a solid film, one that doesn't get great until the second half. It's bogged down by its stage obligations. The first forty minutes are incredibly unfocused, following plot threads that have no intention of going anywhere and its contrived eccentric family stick out like a sore thumb. Naturally, nothing about it is organic. But it owns its classical themes of greed and generational pressures like it doesn't exist in any other film. However, its best moment was later topped in the exact same way in It's A Wonderful Life's climax, which explains how it didn't have a shot at a Picture win. It's sentimental, with no sense of what makes for good visuals, but it's likable. That's Capra for you.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Reasons Why This Movie Is Not Very Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though Frank Capra movies are typically classified as comedies, yet they really are not that funny. One reason is that they come across as homilies, and as there is nothing humorous about moralizing, there is an inconsistent tone throughout. Worse yet, the moral of his movies tends to be so simplistic as to have no practical value. Some of his movies are better than others, of course. But notwithstanding the fact that it got the Academy Award for Best Picture, this is not one of them.The message in this movie in particular is that everyone ought to just do whatever he wants to do. Well, I don't know about you, but if I did what I wanted to do, no one would pay me for it. I like watching movies and writing reviews like this, and if someone wants to pay me to do so, I'll be happy to take his money. But until I retired (and could finally do what I wanted), I spent thirty-five years holding down a job that wasn't much fun. It wasn't a bad job, as jobs go, but it was not what I wanted to do, which was mostly just take it easy and have a good time.The movie centers on a family that embodies this principle of doing whatever you want to do. Grandpa Vanderhof supposedly collects stamps and is able to make money off his expertise, even though it is not clear how. His daughter writes plays, though we doubt she publishes them. His son-in-law and another man fool around with firecrackers in the basement, supposedly selling them from time to time. One of his granddaughters, Essie, takes ballet lessons, so she represents an expense rather than providing an income. And so it goes. There is only one person in the household, Essie's sister Alice, who holds down a real job, as a secretary, which would seem to violate the principle of doing whatever you want to do; but in any event, her income could hardly support the rest of the household. I suppose I should mention they have a full-time maid, who also is their cook, and they live in a house worth $25,000 in 1938 dollars, which adjusted for inflation would be over $400,000 today (at one point they are offered $100,000 for the house, or about $1,670,000, adjusted for inflation).Doing what you want apparently includes not paying your income taxes. When an Internal Revenue Agent shows up to talk to Grandpa Vanderhof because he never files income tax returns, he says he doesn't believe in paying taxes because he doesn't care for the things the money is spent on. This completely confounds the IRS agent, as if the agency had never had to deal with that attitude before. When warned by Alice's fiancé, Tony Kirby, that he might get in trouble, Grandpa says he really doesn't owe the IRS any money. I guess that stamp-collecting expertise hasn't been all that remunerative after all.By now you may be thinking that I have missed the whole point, that this is just a comedy. Well, that brings us back to my original point. The movie just is not that funny. And because it is not very funny, I had time to reflect upon the sermon being preached by this movie, which I concluded was absurd for the reasons just given.The ridiculous moral lesson of this movie is not the only thing that works against the intended humor. The movie is more manic than funny. We are supposed to be delighted by this crazy household, when in reality, none of us could stand being in that living room for more than a few minutes. You would not have to be a stuffed shirt like Tony's father or a snob like Tony's mother to be appalled that your son wanted to marry into a family like that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unjustly forgotten screwball comedy about class differences, marred only by a sappy, antiquated message that money won't buy happiness. Having no money and playing the harmonica apparently will. But then again, this was made for Depression-era audiences, so the notion of money as the root of all evil and being happy derived without benefit of money must have been a sure crowd pleaser in its time. Very populist, right down to repeated crowd shots of everyday folks in a courtroom scene. Jean Arthur lives with an eccentric, extended family that does not worry about money (although its is made plain early on that family patriarch Lionel Barrymore earned quite a bit of moolah in his time, so no one in this crazy family need worry about where their next meal is coming from or whether they will have a roof over their heads. Heck, they even have a pair of black servants! Arthur falls in love with her boss at the bank, played by rising start Jimmy Stewart. Stewart's stuffy old dad, bank president Edward Arnold, is all about money and status, nothing else. A plot element has Arnold trying to buy Barrymore's house for some nefarious project. Arthur insists on Stewart's family meeting her family before they tie the knot. You can imagine what transpires when they finally gather (collide might be a better word) for dinner at the Barrymore household. We get a little bit of "A Christmas Carol" thrown in when an old tycoon and crony of Arnold's, now destitute, confronts Arnold about his greedy and sinful ways. For this scene, the camera is stationed behind and to the left of the old tycoon, with Arnold standing several feet away intently and silently listening to him. We never get thee expected reverse shot as the tycoon delivers his sermon. Only after he finishes his speech and turns to leave, do we see him plainly. In this way, the fellow seem almost spectral and unreal, like Marley's ghost, and this makes his speech all the more powerful. Or maybe it's just me. A stellar supporting cast includes Donald Meek, Spring Byington, Mischa Auer, Eddie Anderson, Harry Davenport and several others. By today's standards, the film is much too preachy and dated. But it is still lots of fun. Wait until you see the wildly improbable jail sequence about halfway through.</fullReview>

Frank Capra has always managed to put a smile on my face and Jimmy Stewart has always been able to warm up my heart - I know how cheesy that sounds, but bear with me. This film was no exception; it did exactly what every Capra and Stewart comedy I've seen has done to me.After seeing the film I was incredibly happy. I laughed, cheered, and smiled throughout the viewing of the film. There is just such an astonishing charm that Jimmy Stewart holds on screen. The very way he moves makes my heart skip. He was the perfect gentlemen, one of the greatest actors of all time, and every movie he ever made, whether it was good in context or not, is always a joy for me to watch. Stewart gives off that amazing charm once again in You Can't Take It With You.I admit that this isn't Capra's best, but when it comes to a director like Capra, even his worst is amazing - and don't get me wrong this is hardly Capra's worst film. The film's acting is great, the story is sweet and enchanting, and of course it features the phenomenal direction of Frank Capra. It's a film that I wouldn't miss viewing for the world. Similarly, I'd recommend it to anyone who loves a Capra film, a Stewart film, or a good romantic comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie seeks to prove that thoughtless, irresponsible people are the salt of the earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take a whole room-full of marvelously wacky characters and then proceed to prove that they're normal ? it's the rest of us who are nuts! That's the formula that Kaufman and Hart employ so engagingly (if rather superficially), in this fairy tale advocation of anarchy, so superbly acted by Barrymore and Arnold we tend to accept all the moralizing at face value and occasionally believe it's true. All the same, there's maybe a bit too much of the cracker-barrel philosophizing and occasionally we are unintentionally reminded by long stretches of dialogue that what we are actually watching was originally a stage play. Despite these strictures, it's still a rewarding and entertaining movie, produced on a grand budget (around $1.65 million ? a staggering amount for Columbia), appealingly acted and characterized ? and absolutely must viewing for Jean Arthur fans who'll be pleased to find their idol so brightly and attractively photographed (especially in her close-ups).What is surprising, however, on a recent viewing of Sony's splendid DVD, is how hollow the characters actually are. Vanderhof continually passes himself off as a good guy, yet actually he has a cruel, mean streak. Notice the way he treats Charles Lane's IRS man who is simply following up two or three letters to Vanderhof which the old man didn't even bother to open, let alone read. He flays Lane unmercifully, and having driven him out of the house, he then claims that he did in fact pay his income tax, "every cent of it." Tony Kirby, also cast in the heroic mold, is equally repulsive, as the whole plot centers on a particularly mean, selfish and utterly stupid trick that he plays on every single member of the cast (except, of course, himself). Other characters, described in the synopsis as "good natured" such as the heroine's dad and her sister's husband are equally selfish, thoughtless and irresponsible. In fact, of all the principal characters, only Jean Arthur's Alice emerges with any credit. (I almost gave a tick to Edward Arnold. His utterly ruthless arms profiteer has been considerably cleaned up for the movie, but he's still hideously repulsive as the brief scene with H.B. Warner amply demonstrates. I wonder why Capra left that very brief encounter in the film? Maybe he thought Arnold was making the character too sympathetic?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all have dreams, aspirations and desires that never seem to come to fruition. Maybe it's because they seem to frivolous or unimportant or impossible for our time. Whatever the reason, we can all learn a lesson or two from the Vanderhof and Sycamore family; a family so tightly bound with one another it would make any dysfunctional family insanely jealous. What is so unique about these people is how they all do exactly what is the desire of their heart. The mother writes plays, the daughter dances, the father makes fireworks and a few other people find their way into the house and get swept up in the same fervor.The patriarch of this clan is Grandpa, played with incredible joy and sincerity by the great Lionel Barrymore, who is unquestionably one of the finest and most versatile actors of all time. He was perfect as the curmudgeon Mr. Potter in It's A Wonderful Life, and here is the complete opposite; a man who loves life and knows the importance of spending your time wisely doing something you love.What shakes everyone up is the fact that their daughter, Alice, gets involved with Tony Kirby, son of the famous and ruthless banker AP Kirby trying to seal a deal which requires him to buy out the Vanderhof house. Of course they refuse, and one very funny scene leads to another until the stuck-up and pretentious Kirby's get a culture shock when they meet this eccentric but completely genuine family. Directed by perhaps the most genuine of all American directors, Frank Capra, the film balances the story line ever so delicately, never making the Vanderhof/Sycamores seem too weird or bizarre but making them totally lovable as well. This is thanks in no small part to the acting, led by Jean Arthur in one of her most serious roles as well as the aforementioned Barrymore.James Stewart got his big break here and despite being underused, still is quite effective as the wide-eyed son who despite being born with a silver spoon in his mouth seems troubled about the way his family sees others. Edward Arnold is very good as the elder Kirby, always looking to make a deal but also gets some big news flashes in the process. This is a film that just makes you smile; some scenes more than others. But Capra knows how to use the emotional factor in his films and with great bravado, creates a stirring climax certain to put a smile on any viewer's face.The main lesson here, obviously, is to devote your life to do something you want to do, not just something you are able to. There is also the notion of young love and two very different families coming together. Here you can see the seeds of films like My Big Fat Greek Wedding and others of the type. But what Capra is able to diffuse into the story and into our hearts is something that will probably never be resurrected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think I've always wanted to live...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...at Grandpa van der Hoof (Vanderhof?)'s house. I actually think I dream of it.It's been a long time since I last read the actual Kaufman/Hart play, but time never lapses long before I find myself wanting to see Frank Capra's screen version of "You Can't Take It With You." If Robert Riskin's screenplay mutes some of the socialist fervor of the original, where certainly Grandpa wouldn't have suggested substituting "Americanism" for "Socialism," it does create a dichotomy between an uptight social-climbing society, symbolized by the "Kirbys," and the happy if rather chaotic society of Grandpa and his family.I don't think it is entirely a mistake that, in the fictional New York City of Kaufman/Hart/ Riskin that Grandpa is a representative of the city's (Dutch) past, i.e., "van der Hoof" and that the symbol of predatory capitalism is Kirby, representative of a "modern" WASP point of view that desires an exclusivity it can never really possess. I also don't think that the law's preoccupation with the unintentional--or at least harmless--gaffes of the Vanderhofs and their friends are unintentional on the part of the writers or the director. In a sense, I find it entirely fitting that people who ostensibly come from a much older heritage might find some of the statutory adventures of modern society constraining.Andrew Carnegie is supposed to have said "The man who dies rich dies disgraced," which is a hair's breadth away from "You can't take it with you." (In fact, I once proposed that a portrait of Carnegie along with "You can't take it with you" be a symbol for my non-profit management school, but they just didn't get it.)As a happy beneficiary of Mr. Carnegie's fortune, and as a lover of American cinema, I suggest that this film is one of the greatest ever made, and certainly the summit of Capra's contribution. It epitomizes the idea of the freewheeling American spirit of which capitalism is merely a part, contrasted with the narrower point of view that encourages homogeneity and acquisition. The Vanderhof/Sycamore clan lives in a big old house that has room for everyone, even for people with whom they don't agree--and others are lessened in comparison.The cast for this film is incredible, and Capra brings out the best in them. It is undoubtedly the best of all Lionel Barrymore's roles, which is saying a lot, but there's a lot of Dr. Gillespie in Grandpa, isn't there? Spring Byington, Jean Arthur, James Stewart, Donald Meek, Harry Davenport, Charles Lane, Dub Taylor, Mischa Auer, and Edward Arnold were all wonderful. It would be remiss for me not to point out that Ann Miller never had a better role--or was better in a role--in her entire career. (Whether or not this is the fault of MGM's "Freed Unit" may be debated, but I think it is.) She's adorable, and legend has it that she was 14 at the time!The film has its ironies: the whole neighborhood is depending upon Grandpa to void it's agreements to sell its property to Kirby and Co, to which it, individually and severally, has already submitted.There are also little jokes: DePinna's was once a famous New York department store, and Mr. DePinna was the Iceman that came and never left; my personal favorite is when Dub Taylor (Ed) is playing Chopin's "Grand Valse Brilliante" on the xylophone, and "Essie" (Ann Miller) says"Oh, I like that, Ed. Yours?""No, Chopin.""It's got a lot of you in it!" The thing to remember about this film is that everybody in it is SANE, and its message is that we depend upon people like Grandpa to keep us going. As I said: I think I have always wanted to live in that house: there's room enough to be oneself, room enough for others, and when somebody stops by, they find you just as you are, not as you're supposed to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra apparently took it with him</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a movie isn't a movie at all; sometimes it is just a play. And sometimes when it is just a play, it is a just a forum for the playwright's reaching. Fair enough I suppose.You'll find a lot of those in the 30's, where America was trying to find itself and was toying with socialist ideas that today seem radical. At the same time, movies were trying on several ideas in a quest to discover what they were.Both of these exploratory periods are largely forgotten today and the options they offered aren't grieved as they should have been.This play was a sentimental screed on the terrors of capitalism, and how it necessarily destroys the soul of everyone who participates. The bad guy drives competitors to death, aspires to be the world's largest arms provider, a monopoly in fact. Bankers = bad. Dropouts - good.There's an inserted bit where our hero (Barrymore) refuses to pay taxes on the grounds that they do nothing useful. And another (from the play) where inept cops arrest the crowd as suspected Soviet revolutionaries. They are tossed in a cell with folks obviously there because of financial injustices.Its entertaining enough, and if you thought "Wonderful Life" was a great film, you'll like this too. You'll probably like "V for Vendetta" also, as it is a similar simpleminded polemic wrapped in a minimum of cinematic sugar. Same core, different sugar.And it is the sugar, after all that makes this work.In the similar, later one for Stewart, "Pot O Gold," the characters weren't comical. They did comical things, but none of them were ridiculous, even the greedy capitalist who, like in this, needs to buy a house and is thwarted by happy campers.This script is different (Pulitzer-winning, incidentally). Silly characters populate the thing: A girl who imagines herself a ballerina and can't stop dancing; her dope husband who still thinks he is on the College football team; a man obsessed with fireworks; another with mechanical toys and so on. A large Russian visitor who comes for the free meals and whose opinion of everything is: "It stinks." Black jitterbugging servants.Beware, you'll like this little confection, and even buy the message within as a result. Or you'll wish you lived in a so-called "simpler time" during which this simple wrapper and message worked.If you come to these old things because you like one of the actors, let me point out Ann Miller as the dance-obsessed wife. She was 14 at the time, having lied about her age to get the job. What an amazing presence she was, even then.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An author once remarked that the best thing that can happen to a writer is for someone to purchase the rights to his property and then never make a movie out of it. The play of YCTIWY was marvelous. I loved the script so much that I, a very shy person, auditioned for my local theatre guild's production of it. (I was cast as Rheba.)I rented to movie and what I saw disturbed me. With the exception of the scenes lifted line for line from the play, the rest was unrecognizable. Why the subplot about the land purchase? Why the gradiose "commercial" for "goodness?" A smart, snappy play with its wonderful and uplifting message about the wonders of being oneself became a sticky bowl of treacle. Did they think the American public wouldn't "get it?" It was sad to see such a first rate cast in a second rate version of something that was excellent to being with. (Speaking of cast -- I guess this movie put a lot of folks to work in the 1930s. The play had a fairly large cast for a straight play to begin with, but the production company seemed to have more than quadrupled it!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dangerously beguiling, pretty meretricious nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tosh - pure but not entirely simple, and not entirely benign. Like most of Capra's output it concerns paternal and paternalist authority, and how they ought to function in an authentic American ideology where family-oriented conservatism and individual libertarianism have to come to some sort of accord. As in "It Happened One Night" the central problem is a father figure who has to be converted (the mother here *doesn't* have to be converted, except gesturally and as a joke once the drama is over - maternal authority is an irrelevance in Capra's fatherly world). The conversion can carry no conviction whatever at the level of characterisation in either film; Walter Connolly's sheer talent carries it off handsomely in "It Happened One Night", but it was expecting too much from any actor to do the same for the ludicrous role of Kirby Sr., and Edward Arnold isn't in Connolly's class.Of course it shouldn't be a drawback that a comedy is ludicrous, but this is a desperately serious, self-important comedy, scattered with deadly speechifying that the script can't then laugh off. The result here is embarrassingly juvenile as political discourse and rather too slow, talky and stagy as film comedy. Capra the director has great fun with some individual scenes, though others are very slackly edited and directed without much imagination, and he presides over lovely performances from Stewart (playing the same character as usual) and Jean Arthur (in a dullish, underwritten role), notably in their first scene together (she on the telephone); Lionel Barrymore looks generally rather joyless, which actually makes the role more palatable than as written - one gets the impression that all his jollity is forced, and that the spectral presence of his dead wife is what really drives the film. This is curious, because the principal living wife (Mary Forbes, imperious as Mrs A. P. Kirby) is, as I've said, a mere figure of fun, designed to make her husband look salvageable by comparison.The argument appears to be that all of society is one big extended family (the whole block calls Barrymore 'Grandpa', not just his own household) and the film hopes to use the model to justify a paradoxical conservatism in which the good really do know and like their place, but have also chosen it. It wants to imagine a proto-drop-out society within the heart of old-fashioned communities, in which everyone is doing what they love most, yet still have black servants; in which everyone looks out for each other, but you can allow the eviction of all your neighbours of decades' standing, to run off after your own daughter (there comes a point where nuclear family and extended family don't pull together any longer). It gets more and more inconsistent the more you think about it. But it does have a few good laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eccentrics don't have to be interesting people -- they often can be just as boring as the next guy. And this film is terribly overpopulated with eccentrics I care nothing about, and that I find more irritating than amusing. Jean Arthur stars as a lovely island of sanity in a household that includes a ballerina that can't dance, a mad bomber, a no-talent artist, and other assorted lunatics. She's in love with Jimmy Stewart, the son of a wealthy industrialist, and she's invited Stewart and his parents to dinner. Knowing she'd be in big trouble if everyone behaves "normally," she's persuaded the family members to be on their best behavior while the guests are around. Unfortunately, Jimmy and his folks show up on the wrong night, and a modicum of hilarity ensues. (I've always suspected that the TV series "The Munsters" was based more on this story than on "The Addams Family.") "You Can't Take It With You," originally a Kaufman/Hart play, was directed by Frank Capra, one of the great figures of the film industry. This film was a pothole on his road to success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let me introduce you to the family...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big Frank Capra fan and Messrs Deeds, Smith &amp; Doe are all high up in my list of all-time favourite movies, to say nothing of the peerless "It's A Wonderful Life", but watching this old chestnut again, I felt the old "Capra-magic" was less prominent than usual and that the movie had a mustiness about it of, well, a big old house, like the one at the centre of the plot! It's been said before that other superior Capra movies were less well rewarded than this one which unaccountably for me won the "Best Director" &amp; "Best Film" Oscars of its year, this in a vintage year with "The Adventures Of Robin Hood" and "Angels With Dirty Faces" amongst the shouldn't-have-been runners up.Of course it's not without its charms, with the seniors leading the way in the acting stakes, especially Lionel Barrymore and Edward Arnold, followed by the always watchable James Stewart and Jean Arthur, both, like so many others on view, Capra perennials. Capra demonstrates his gift again for crowd scenes, choreographing his players skilfully, not easy when these include a careering Negro servant, forever pirouetting ballet dancer and old man Barrymore permanently on crutches. And yet I found this satire on greed had too much of the velvet glove about it and some of the serious scenes just too bleak when set in counterpoint to what has gone before. Never mind that Edward Arnold's "Tammany Hall" prototype AP Kirby drives an innocent man to an early death; within minutes he's leading the party in a jamboree by playing a mouth-organ duet with Barrymore to salve his conscience and get us to the predictable happy-ending.Certain scenes are redolent of other films, for example Stewart and Arthur's goofy dance in the park prompted by a bunch of what look like refugee kids from "Our Town" was reworked better in "It's A Wonderful Life", while the couple's embarrassing entrance and exit at a society dinner pales alongside Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn's hilarious doings in a similar scene in Hawks' "Bringing Up Baby". I've also just watched Preston Sturges' lesser known "Christmas in July" and got more sense of community there than I got here, and it plays a full 50 minutes less! I could also comment yet again on the subservient stereotypical roles doled out to the Negroes in the cast but this was par for the course I appreciate for many Hollywood films of this era. Enough, already; for me Capra is at his best when there's a dark undertow to his work, as in all four of his other films I mentioned earlier. Here the whimsy comes over as flimsy and no amount of amusing eccentricity on display can displace the feeling that this creaky old theatrical adaptation is now showing its age and doesn't belong in the vanguard of this great director's work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding yet disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film deserves the accolades other reviewers have heaped on it except for one thing: stereotypes, especially of the black characters. OK, it stretches credibility when the family, and a large one at that, has no visible means of support yet lives in relative opulence, especially for the Depression. They even have servants! One is forced to assume, because it is never revealed, that Grandpa had been so successful when he rode back down the elevator that he was set for life. Or that his daughter's plays, or his son-in-law's firecrackers are moneymakers.Anyway we can leave all that aside; after all it is a comedy, and I must admit a very funny one. Barrymore is admirable, performing on crutches due to his crippling arthritis. And the chemistry between Jean Arthur and James Stewart is a veritable wonder. Individually they both shine in their roles. Together they are dazzling.But oh how the portrayal of the two black characters rankles. Not the fact they cooked or ran errands, there's nothing demeaning in that, but how much better of a film it would have been if they actually sat at the table with the rest of the family instead of being relegated to the sidelines. That's the major flaw here and it's a heartbreaking one given the excellence of the rest of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A colorful &amp; joyous comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Frank Capra, "You Can't Take It with You" won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1938. With a screenplay by Robert Riskin, based on a stage play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, it involves two conflicting families: the wealthy Kirbys, the father of whom is a tough, no-nonsense banker and munitions tycoon, and the carefree Vanderhof/Sycamore family, a bunch of eccentrics who spend their days passionately imbibing on their own little childish whims. In his opening scene, the kind, lovable Grandpa Martin Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore) rescues Mr. Poppins (Donald Meek) from his dull day job and brings him to his wacky home so that he may spend his time doing what he loves to do the most. This becomes one of the central attitudes of the picture.Frank Capra was a genius when it came to casting. Grandpa Vanderhof is my favorite character in "You Can't Take It with You," and who better to portray him than Lionel Barrymore? The sweet-natured Vanderhof is the most lovable and delightful character in the picture, always encouraging his family and friends to do the things that they really want to do, and believing that money should be spent on all things enjoyable since it cannot be taken with you when your time comes. (This is entirely opposite of Barrymore's Scrooge-like Mr. Potter character in Frank Capra's classic 1946 film "It's a Wonderful Life.") The heavyset Edward Arnold was perfect for the stern role of munitions industrialist Anthony P. Kirby. The super-wealthy, money-conscious Kirby learns from Vanderhof that there is more in life than business deals and that if he is not careful, he shall become a failure because of the eventual loss of all his friends. My favorite actor James Stewart, even though his role is not nearly as flashy as Barrymore's or Arnold's, seemed to be just right for the part of Mr. Kirby's son Tony. The shy, warmhearted innocence (and the light touch of humor) that Stewart brings to his role indicates that he was maturing as a young actor with only a few years of experience in Hollywood. Not to mention Jean Arthur as the friendly Alice Sycamore, Tony's secretary and perhaps the only "sane" member of Grandpa Vanderhof's clan; Mischa Auer as the pompous Russian choreographer Mr. Kolenkhov; Spring Byington as Grandpa's daughter Penny Sycamore, who writes plays that are never produced; Samuel S. Hinds as Penny's husband Paul, who spends his time in the basement with his friend Mr. DePinna (Halliwell Hobbes) lighting firecrackers; Ann Miller as ballerina Essie Sycamore, daughter of Penny &amp; Paul and sister to Alice; Dub Taylor as Ed, the vibraphonist husband to Essie; Donald Meek as the eccentric toy maker Mr. Poppins; and the two fun-loving African-American servants of this wacky family, named Rheba (Lillian Yarbo) and Donald (Eddie Anderson).Here are my favorite highlights from "You Can't Take It with You." During their first scene together in Tony's office, Tony tells Alice that he could always get what he wanted if he yelled loudly enough, and he gives her a sample. Vanderhof shares a quiet moment with granddaughter Alice before her date with Tony, and later on Vanderhof has a little fun with an IRS agent (Charles Lane) who tries to confront him about owing the government years and years of back income taxes. While sitting on a park bench during a quiet evening, Tony tells Alice of a solar energy experiment that he took on with a friend. At the posh restaurant, Tony comically describes an impending scream rushing from his feet up to his head; Alice is so frightened that it is she who does the screaming. An overwhelming mass of fireworks blows up prior to everyone getting arrested. At the jail, Vanderhof tries to console Mr. Kirby but soon loses his temper and confronts him about his accumulated wealth and power; later on in the courtroom, Alice very loudly confronts both Tony and Mrs. Kirby (Mary Forbes) for similar reasons, and chaos erupts as photographers invade the premises. Mr. Kirby's business competitor Mr. Ramsey (H. B. Warner) warns him that he will have a crackup if he's not careful, and shortly after that, Tony tells his dad that he wants no further part in his business ventures. And finally, the song "Polly Wolly Doodle" accompanies the final merrymaking at the Vanderhof home celebrating Mr. Kirby's reformation.One particular author wrote that nothing could be more tiresome than having to sit through "You Can't Take It with You" in its entirety, but I strongly disagree. As a screwball comedy it is wonderful, and its message is quite clear: enjoy your life to the fullest, and as long as you have friends, you will never be a failure. As if to prove the point, Grandpa Vanderhof says one line in the play that (regrettably) never made it in the film: "Never take life seriously. No one's lived through it yet."</fullReview>

Watching Ann Miller, Donald Meek (he was so gosh darn cute in the movie), Jean Arthur and especially Lionel Barrymore act was a real treat.

		<shortDescription>Kaufman &amp; Hart's classic play in its screen incarnation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You Can't Take It With You" is Kaufman &amp; Hart at their very best as they depict a family (and the other people who live with them) who live by their own rules. The patriarch, played by Lionel Barrymore, is an ex-businessman who believes in simple values, in following your dreams, and in loving thy neighbor. His granddaughter, portrayed by Spring Byington, writes plays because a typewriter was mistakenly delivered to the house; her husband plays with fireworks in the basement; her daughter dances en pointe around the house; the dance teacher eats with them and has the maid do his laundry - etc. It's a chaotic, fun household where the nightly prayer at dinner ends with "We have our health. We leave the rest to You." Jean Arthur is Alice, Barrymore's granddaughter, who lives with her family in the house and works in a bank. She falls in love with Jimmy Stewart (in his star-making role) and there the fun begins, as Stewart introduces his staid, money-grubbing, social-climbing parents into his future wife's household. What follows is a delightful clash.It seems that post-depression and pre-World War II, there was an emphasis on basic values and family - not so much the strict "family values" of today, but more a live and let live, and what's the point of killing yourself to make a living if you're not happy. "The Magnificent Dope" has a very similar theme. It's refreshing to see these kinds of films and to be reminded of this wonderful philosophy. "You Can't Take It With You" is a brilliant playing out of this lifestyle, filled with delightful performances, right down to the neighbors. I don't agree that it's dated - I think it's as timely as ever, right down to the references about solar power.</fullReview>

There's a sweet, charming movie in this mess somewhere, but we're effectively kept from it by an army of grotesque, ridiculously exaggerated characters who are next to impossible to root for. I wasn't surprised at all to learn that the original play had a much smaller cast; it's clear to me that a shorter film, with a half dozen characters trimmed and the remainder endowed with a degree of self-awareness, would have been twice as enjoyable. As it it is, it may have been fun to write or to film - but it just isn't fun to watch."Harvey" and "The Shop Around the Corner" -- two of my favorite Stewart movies -- played the same night, and this one suffered all the more from the comparisons. See those. Skip this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Questionable, I realize, but there's a lot to value here. Capra's idealism is the kind I might fantasize about. Even if there are problems with his films, I do think there is something to be said about the expressed ideals at the end of the films. This one concerns a Bohemian household living in New York City, led by a benign Grandfather played by Lionel Barrymore. His granddaughter (Jean Arthur) is set upon marrying her boss's son (Jimmy Stewart), who is also deeply in love with her. Stewart's father (Edward Arnold) is a bank president, and he only needs to buy Barrymore's property in order to complete the biggest business deal of his life. When the Bohemian household meets up with the cold-hearted banker and his wife, sparks fly, sometimes literally. The movie is pretty radical, basically promoting anarchy. Barrymore doesn't think he should have to pay taxes, even though no viewer can miss that members of his household pose a major fire hazard with their basement-produced fireworks. But, really, these characters are broad and extreme for the sake of comedy. In reality, You Can't Take It with You is a powerful statement of the values of individuality. The bank president villain is often thought of as shallow, but the point is that he, his business associates, and the members of his social class are set on looking at anyone who is below them as unimportant. Individualism is a cornerstone of the American culture, and, despite some major flaws in the corners of this film, its message is an overwhelmingly positive one.</fullReview>

It has been done before and usually these results do not come off very well.

		<shortDescription>THE Barrymore . . . not the other one . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes a film as immediate, enjoyable and endlessly watchable nearly 70 years after it was produced? Case in point: "You Can't Take It With You." Certainly there are other equally antiquated films that retain their freshness. But comedy is an art form that notoriously "dates" almost before it is performed.Frank Capra captured some timeless and impressive moments from his timeless and impressive cast, here. Most especially the remarkable Lionel Barrymore ? literally on his "last legs" from crippling arthritis. You'd never know it from his performance on crutches (conveniently excused in the film as a misadventurous slide down the banister in his home).More of Barrymore (the REAL actor: not the alcoholic eye-shadowed ham his brother John became) momentarily.Watch the initial scene with James Stewart and Jean Arthur. Their amazing line delivery makes every word seem spontaneous. Capra's direction is so innocently sexy as to be almost shocking! Locked in a romantic clench, Miss Arthur (as Stewart's secretary) attempts ? and succeeds ? at answering the phone with her teeth so as not to break the embrace. Though there may be double and even triple entendres underlying this brilliant bit of business (pure Capra), it plays like the innocent goodnight kiss on your first date ? though in fact it's a proposal of marriage.Or watch Miss Arthur and Mr. Barrymore in the bedroom scene, where he reveals why he'll never sell this house, and she reveals how much she loves James Stewart's character. Watch how the scene is shot, in front of a mirror. You can only play this scene this way on film, not onstage. Watch these two consummate actors play grandfather and granddaughter with a sweetness and lilt and a lifetime of love that belies the fact that they barely knew each other as actors.Watch Edward Arnold's arc from arrogant financial tycoon to lost father. He seldom got to play a range like this (though if you get a chance, catch him in an old kinescope of "Twelve Angry Men" from "Playhouse 90" on television and marvel at how LITTLE really fine actors ever got a chance to do, on film.).Supporting players are uniformly perfect. Donald Meek's "Poppins" is the embodiment of the playful, creative child who lives in all of us, finally released from the drudgery of an anonymous 9-to-5 job. Mischa Auer, Samuel S. Hinds, H.B. Warner, Spring Byington, Ann Miller, Dub Taylor, Mary Forbes, Eddie Anderson and Lillian Yarbro (as the Sycamore's black servants ? and if you think white character actors were and are ill-served in films, think about the situation in which black actors found and find themselves) ? all are superlative. "There are no small parts," goes the old theatrical chestnut, "only small actors." Not a small actor in the bunch, here.Towering above them all, even on crutches, even soon to be forced to play roles in a wheelchair because of his arthritis, is Lionel Barrymore. While his brother John, "The Profile," may have been, and be, more famous, it is Lionel who is the better actor for the ages. Lionel eschewed "stardom" for talent. He submerged himself into every role, unlike John, who made every role "serve" his erstwhile star status.Compare Barrymore's playing here, on crutches, yet!, with his portrayal of Kringelein in "Grand Hotel" a mere six years earlier. Nothing about these two characters is remotely similar. Except their humanity. Watch Barrymore's desperation in "Grand Hotel," as a man who knows he is dying and grasping at whatever is left of life's bounty and goodness . . . (his all-but-silent "drunk" scene alone in his hotel room is virtually an exercise in pantomime to rival Marcel Marceau) . . . and contrast his playing here, as Grandpa Vanderhof, who has lived and survived his beloved wife's death and his decision to leave the rat-race with easy gusto, ready humor and sheer delight at the human condition.Or contrast his thoroughly detestable "Mr. Potter" in Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" eight years later, and confined to a wheelchair.THIS Barrymore played roles long after his younger brother, John, died of alcoholism and stardom.Not to slight James Stewart and Jean Arthur. Their scenes together are magic.So is "It's A Wonderful Life," which weaves a spell that still captivates long after all its participants have left us. In this case, left us laughing, loving and longing for the days when actors and films were powerful enough to last for decades and make a mockery of Time.What? You think "Basic Instinct" or Spielberg's "War of the Worlds" will be required viewing in 70 years?--</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The stenographer Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur) is in love with her boss Tony Kirby (James Stewart), who is the vice-president of the powerful company owned by his greedy father Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold). Kirby Sr. is dealing a monopoly in the trade of weapons, and needs to buy one last house in a twelve block area owned by Alice's grandparent Martin Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore). However, Martin is the patriarch of an anarchic and eccentric family where the members do not care for money but for having fun and making friends. When Tony proposes Alice, she states that it would be mandatory to introduce her simple and lunatic family to the snobbish Kirbys, and Tone decides to visit Alice with his parents one day before the scheduled. There is an inevitable clash of classes and lifestyles, the Kirbys spurn the Sycamores and Alice breaks with Tony, changing the lives of the Kirby family.The humanist Frank Capra certainly was a shine man. His movies, at least those I have seen again and again, are very beautiful, with wonderful messages of love and harmony and many nominations and awards. I have just watched "You Can Take It With You" for the second and third time, sixty-nine years after its release, and again I loved his direction, the story, the performances, the cinematography and mostly, the awesome message in the end. Lionel Barrymore and Edward Arnold have a magnificent duel of philosophies of life, and Jean Arthur and James Stewart a perfect chemistry in this lovely romantic comedy. The crazy Sycamore family is responsible for the funniest moments, in a house that looks like an insane asylum. Men like Frank Capra give hope and make our world better, and I believe right in this moment Frank Capra is in Heaven listening to "Polly Wolly Doodle" and dancing the "Big Apple". My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Do Mundo, Nada Se Leva" ("From the World, Nothing is Taken")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite plays when well done. This movie is not. It is flat all the way through. These are good actors, but it seems like a readthrough where each one waits for the other to read his line then reads this one back with no true interaction. The zaniness and quirkiness never comes to life. Painfull for me to admit about this cast--many of my favorites, including the director--but I have seen better performances of this work in community theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie. Loved it in all it's silliness and great moral lesson. In 2016, this is a great movie for the USA culture lost in the values of "Money is king" and "Following your passion will always lead to success."The movie does a great job showing how "wealth at all costs" breeds arrogance beyond law and the common good of humanity. It also does a great job showing that the root of happiness is creativity, even if creativity doesn't lead to success, and seeking the common good of society. It shows a Utopian ideal that everyone can be happy if we allow everyone to just be themselves and each person pitches in to help the common good of everyone regardless of their station in life.A great perspective that even a "rich kid" who is in love still cannot fully grasp respect of persons despite his love. (The restaurant scene.) He had ample opportunities not to embarrass his beloved but takes advantage of her situation for the pleasure of a laugh. Hence, he's drawn to her innocent courage and freedom from fear but still is tied to the conditioning of his parents. He is own pursuit of happiness is bound by his family's wealth until he finally breaks from it.Great - awesome in fact - portrayal that the rich aren't just accepted. One has to earn their way into the hearts and lives of others regardless of the size of their wallet. And, earning your way into the lives of others is something we must all work towards.No doubt, there are some flaws against reality. One example is a person not paying their income taxes for 20+ years. Also, the viewer is left wondering how does the poor family maintain their livelihood. Friends coming to the financial rescue (but this drives the moral that if you seek the common good, there is a tangible payback). There's scenes that will offend some post-modern sensibilities - sexual harassment in the workplace, early 20th century buffoonery from black actors, Russians are uncouth, etc.Interesting how the movie pushes the common good but adds just a small subtlety of how communism is bad. The middle class is the hero and the "right way" for humanity. It has a strong Republican message but a Republican view that supports the common good of the middle class and not serving the wealthy alone.Grandpa is an interesting central character. All wise, ever loving, willing to sacrifice self, creative, free, and capable of enjoying rest, reconciling with enemies, not burdened by ecclesiology but religious. His sprained foot could be interpreted as the cross he bares for loving his children - an inconvenience that cannot rob him of his intrinsic joy. He even doesn't give into temptation of throwing a dart yet speaks the truth that hurts the ego of people who are lost in a life of oppressive wealth. He finished his work years ago and "came down the elevator" to enjoy his creation and family. He is an image of the Christian god or at least the Christian ideal. If Grandpa is the Christian God. Anthony Kirby is likened to Satan, who oppresses everyone around him and even causes the death of a person who once was his friend. He has worldly power but it cannot withstand the common good or Grandpa's wisdom and charity. But eventually, he repents of his sins.Another Christian motif is the harmonica. When one is focused on the wrong things in life, there is no song in his heart. But if one is right with God (be like Grandpa), life becomes a song which invites others into the joy of it. Definitely a classic in my book. Hollywood doesn't make them like they use to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU The film is a romantic comedy that at times treated very serious topic. The rich snobs against wacky, eccentric but, it seems to me very nice people. Conflict of family, property and way of thinking. Meeting of two different social categories shaken "most beautiful" thing in the world - love. My impression is that most Capra's protagonist finds happiness in small things. Of course, there must be a difference between a good and successful man. These little things may act strange, but certainly not negligible. Source of happiness and satisfaction is at hand, only it needs to be open.Martin "Grandpa" Vanderhof's (Lionel Barrymore) house is the film's utopian space. All are happy and satisfied, somewhat eccentric and definitely crazy. Of course, everyone is doing only what they want. Penny Sycamore (Spring Byington), Vanderhof's daughter, writes plays because a typewriter was accidentally sent to the house eight years ago. Her daughter, Essie Carmichael (Ann Miller), practices dance even though she exhibits no talent for it. Ed Carmichael (Dub Taylor), Essie's husband, plays xylophone in order to accompany her dancing. The house in which all are welcome. The basement is the right valley of creativity.Important segments of the story are the government and capital. One individual resists both. Grandpa Martin Vanderhof is incredibly calm and positive character and he "protest" in a specific way. You Can't Take It With You also subtly links class with gender. Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur), of the lower middle-class, is engaged to Tony Kirby (James Stewart), son of millionaire. This proportion is slightly idealized. How important vision is? The vision is temporary? At different moments of most of the characters accept the truth in this or that way. For this reason I do not like the idyllic ending of the film. I convinced myself that this is a romantic comedy.Capra has again been very careful with cinematography, framing and dialogue. Acting is at a high level. Of course Lionel Barrymore is masterly. The film is a good way out of the dark for two hours. It's very funny.</fullReview>

It's another time and my sense of humor doesn't fit. The movie works best with Stewart and Arthur but at times, they seem to be the side show. The basic structure is there.

		<shortDescription>Date, third-rate Capra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra's work a window on a time before American idealism was replaced by the more modern trend of cynicism, the age that was washed out by the devastating experiences of World War II, Vietnam and Watergate. This kind of early positive Americanism is long gone and it is such a gift to have Capra's work to remind us of a time long gone. In that way, his films are invaluable In 1934, Capra hit the ground running with "It Happened One Night", a film so successful and with such a far-reaching effect that it basically invented the institution of the screwball comedy and the romantic comedy. 80 years later, it still holds up. He won the Oscar for that film, and four years later won again for his adaptation of George Kaufman and Moss Hart's stage success "You Can't Take It With You", which had been so successful that it won the Pulitzer Prize. Capra's adaptation won Best Picture yet, while it contains all of Capra's trademark, time has not been kind and, in spite of its status in Oscar history it has more or less slipped into the dustbins of history.The movie isn't bad, just dated. The story is clunky with over-sized characterization and an antiquated theme about the value of friends over money. The story involves Capra's favorite kind of villain, the heartless corporate businessman, in this case a certain Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold) The C.E.O. of Kirby and Co., a bank that seems to be booming despite the depression. Kirby wants to expand his business to get in on the munitions market and needs land to do it. He has been successful so far at buying out the residents except for one hold out who won't sell even when offered four times what the house is worth.The man causing the trouble is Martin Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore), a genial Joe who plays the harmonica and refuses to work in favor of having fun. His reason for holding out on the sale is simple: He places a value on the memories that he has tied to the house over any kind of money that Kirby is willing to shell out. Kirby is the kind of bullish business man who doesn't take no for an answer and orders his underlings to get Vanderhof and his family out of the house by any means necessary.Meanwhile, Kirby's sweet-natured son Tony (Jimmy Stewart) has become engaged to Alice Sycamore, his secretary. Unknown to either party, Alice is actually Vanderhof's granddaughter. She's actually the only normal member of the family. The rest are defined by their quirks. Sister Essie (Ann Miller) dances everywhere she goes. Her husband Ed (Dub Taylor) plays the xylophone. Penny (Spring Byington), Alices's mother bangs away on the typewriter. Paul, Alice's father (Samuel S. Hinds), plays with erector sets. A defected Russian named Boris (Mischa Auer) hangs around the house and acts as Essie's dance instructor. And a new member of the household, Mr. Poppins (Donald Meek), likes to make things.Everyone in the house has a personality quirk and they are so quirky because Mr. Vanderhof allows their qualities to flourish. He describes his household as "a place where everyone does what they want." Naturally, it isn't long before the blue-blooded Kirby's and the bohemian Sycamores have a culture clash that brings Vanderhof to full-froth over Kirby's greed and lack of humanity. It's all too obvious.Nothing seems to work here. The message is inane and dated. The characters are all types, not people. The romance is dull, which is surprising given that they are played by Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur. The movie has no grace or reality. It is the kind of movie that is set up to push its message and does so with the hammer. What once seemed fresh and original has dated badly, especially in the wake of similar social message pictures that Capra would make later like "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" and "It's a Wonderful Life". What we have here is third-rate Capra, the work of a director whose films would improve over time.** (of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frank Capra does George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's You Can't Take It with You mostly justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a lifelong fan of It's a Wonderful Life, I always like to cite players from that-my favorite movie-whenever I review other movies they got involved in. Besides director Frank Capra, there are the players of James Stewart, Lionel Barrymore, Samuel S. Hinds, H.B. Warner, Ward Bond, and Charles Lane that would eventually do that one. One other note before reviewing the movie proper-Having just seen Dub Taylor playing the government official who gave Andy Griffith's Will Stockdale his draft notice and accusing him of being a draft dodger in No Time for Sergeants, here he is in his film debut some 20 years before playing a character not too different from Will as he's just as happy-go-lucky here as Stockdale was there! Okay, so after 30 years of reading about this-not to mention having once auditioned for the part of Mr. Henderson when in high school and not getting it but enjoying the performance of my fellow drama club members when playing it just the same-I finally got to see this on Netflix disc and it was as enjoyable as I imagined it could be. Besides those players I just mentioned, I also liked seeing Eddie Anderson-just before becoming Rochester on Jack Benny's radio show-as Donald, Donald Meek as the guy who quits his job to invent things, Edward Arnold as Stewart's father, leading lady Jean Arthur as the "crazy" family's ingénue, Spring Byington as Ms. Arthur's mother, and Ann Miller as the ballerina. With Capra on board, there's as much good drama scenes as comedy and while there may be some logic problems as the way things end, there's mostly a feel-good atmosphere throughout that's simply infectious! So on that note, I highly recommend You Can't Take It with You.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They really cranked them out back then, didn't they? And they are treasures, so many, even the B movies. There was depth of character and quality of life and simplicity that many today are hungry for. Today's movies seem to glorify the strong loner making it. People seem to be encouraged toward self absorption nowadays. The way this group reveled in their togetherness is an inspiration that is needed today. Watched this (multiple repeat for me) with some family not long ago. My early 20's nephew was fully engrossed and asked the title at the end. He'd never seen a black and white and thought old movies to be total duds that time and technology have vastly improved upon. Again, he was fully absorbed throughout. It's one that gives you a lift. You can't resist it. There are plain and simple elements of character and virtue (not a dirty word) that have the power to do that. This is a "feel good" movie. Why not?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be very charming and funny. I give it a lot of leeway for the fact that many of its plot devices, etc. are somewhat silly or sophomoric, after all it is a pioneering movie. The movie itself is one of perhaps hundreds from the era (1930s) that plot rich against poor, and make the poor look like innocent victims. The comparisons between the social and economic conditions in this movie and those of the 2000s and early 2010s are quite remarkable.Contrary to many reviews of Lionel Barrymore (who played Grandpa Martin Vanderhof) that I've read, I find Mr. Barrymore to be a man of the world and very charming in this movie, as he is in many movies in which I've seen him (a notable example is Key Largo, the classic Humphrey Bogart movie and another truly great film in which Mr. Barrymore plays a supporting role).Indeed I would love to escape to Grandpa Vanderhof's eccentric household and do as I pleased with my days for a while... I am a big fan of Jean Arthur (Grandpa Vanderhof's granddaughter) and Jimmy Stewart (Mr. Kirby's silver-spoon fed son and love interest of Ms. Vanderhof) as well and their chemistry in this movie was very good. Also, Edward Arnold did fabulously as Anthony P. Kirby, the antagonist to the lovable Grandpa Vanderhof.All of the acting in the movie was very strong. This is a truly underrated movie. It was a very pleasant discovery for me. This is one I can watch over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Screwball Madcap Hilarious Insanity to a Tee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You Can't Take it With You (1938)Screwball Madcap Hilarious Insanity to a TeeNot only is this an archetypal screwball comedy, where love goes wrong in all the wrong ways, and goes right by the end (of course), but it includes a cast of total nutjob characters. That is, the format is pure insanity the way Bringing Up Baby is insanity, but this isn't a clash of fairly normal types, here, but a celebration of delightful loonies. Yes, it can be ridiculous and a bit predictable, but that's the format of this kind of film. It's not the destination, but the journey.It goes without saying on a journey like this there isn't a calm moment. And good thing! In fact, the non-stop fireworks (literally and metaphorically) as well as the requisite Frank Capra "feel good about being an American" aura make this a really heartwarming movie, too. The bad guys aren't bad, the good guys get what they want, and along the way is a series of classic conflicts and confusions. Capra is a terrific thinking director, whatever his fuzzy sentiments, and he leads the viewer with cinematic sophistication, so we anticipate certain turns of plot and love them when they occur--the harmonica being a symbolic and obvious example.There is certainly an overt message behind all this--money can't buy love--but there are lots of smaller built-in aspects like the notion of community triumphing when people stick together (repeated in It's a Wonderful Life, which has several echos of this earlier movie). Or the idea that the meek inherit the earth--Jimmy Stewart being hopeless meek in the face of his father's corporate giddiness, and the terrific "regular girl" Jean Arthur a prototypical strong but humble woman.So--watch for clever and fast writing, for great (and not always hammy) acting by the four or five main characters that holds together even in its exaggerations, and for fast editing. But also watch how well filmed the movie is, both sets and camera-work. Capra was brilliant at squeezing every square inch of space out of a scene, but without drawing attention to itself (at least not until Arsenic and Old Lace, when it is part of the point to be self- referential). Even the busy, layered up sound is pushing boundaries for the time.Lionel Barrymore, the main character (in case I seem to have forgotten him) is as lovable and admirable as he is hate-able in Wonderful Life. Note how his disability, apparently from a fall in 1936 (and so not a factor in an early classic like Dinner at Eight), is incorporated into the plot. He was such a transcendent actor, directors like Capra built movies around him. Great movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Capra's first pairing with star Jimmy Stewart comes off like a well-made cookoo clock. Harry Cohn, as much of a total ass as he was, was smart enough to know what an asset he had in Capra--- by 1938 (thanks to Capra) Columbia was no longer known as the biggest pile on Poverty Row-- it was a major studio. Audiences in the 30's wanted to see a Frank Capra film after the relative failure of Lost Horizon, he scored a corker with this adaptation of the hit Broadway show (begging the question whether it can be called a 'screwball comedy"). For my cable-TV fees, it's much better than "Holiday"--- Jean Arthur is far more appealing than Kate Hepburn. Great cast; I wonder how hammy Lionel Barrymore got L.B. Mayer to loan him out? It's great to see a 20-ish Dub Taylor, an apparently even younger Ann Miller, Eddie Anderson (minus Mr. Benny), Donald (living up to his name) Meek, Stewart's perennial dad, Samuel S. Hinds (one can only assume Beulah Bondi wasn't available as mom) is on hand as Jean Arthur's dad, who oddly subordinates his paternal role to Mr. Barrymore. Everyone shines--- even a despondent H.B. Warner (Mr. Gower!!!!). Great entertainment: a 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nearly forty years ago, I had the role of Kolenkhov in my high school's presentation of "You Can't Take It With You", and it took all that time to get around to seeing the Oscar winning film today. Watching it brought back some great memories, along with a question. How is it that this film hasn't achieved the type of recognition accorded to "It's A Wonderful Life", also directed by Frank Capra? Both explore similar themes with stellar casts, and defined life's simple values against a backdrop of big business greed. One can only wonder.What's not hard to understand though is how quickly the Sycamore Family grabs you with their zany lifestyle under patriarch Grandpa Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore). He's clearly the voice of reason in the maelstrom of a New York City neighborhood in the shadow of Wall Street. He's also the conscience of a community that comes to rely on his status as the lone holdout against a major munitions manufacturer that wants to buy up the block for a new business enterprise.As daunting as that task sounds, it's the subtle and sometimes not so subtle subtext that comes across more forcefully in the day to day life of the Sycamore home. At any given moment, different members of the family take center stage, each with their own unique personalities precariously balanced above a basement filled with home made explosives. When the inevitable Fourth of July demonstration finally erupts, you've already been conditioned to accept it as just another day with Grandpa Vanderhof.Though most of the movie followed along the lines of the play as I remember it, there was a great additional scene in the park with Tony Kirby (James Stewart) and Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur) where the local kids teach them how to do the 'Big Apple'. As a couple, you just knew Alice and Tony were destined for each other, no matter what the script threw their way.And what a gold mine of supporting players! Edward Arnold as the magnate Kirby, Mischa Auer as Russian ballet instructor Kolenkhov (It steenks!), Spring Byington, Dub Taylor, H.B. Warner and most surprising of all - Eddie Anderson as household servant Donald. He and Lillian Yarbo were generally afforded dignity in their roles as domestics, though there was an unfortunate 'boy' reference thrown at Donald along the way.Even after all this time I was still able to pick off lines before they were spoken, and couldn't help recalling classmates that filled each role. It was especially a moving way to recall my best friend at the time who portrayed Grandpa Vanderhof; he received standing ovations at each performance. I found myself wishing he were watching the movie with me, but he passed away a dozen years ago. That added another dimension to the harmonica duet, a scene that already had enough poignancy to elicit a couple of tears.</fullReview>

Stubborn Grandpa Vanderhof (Barrymore) refuses to sell his home to bank magnate Anthony Kirby (Morgan), who plans to build a munitions plant over the land; affable Anthony Jr. (James Stewart) is in love with Vanderhof's granddaughter Alice (Jean Arthur) over the objections of his class-conscious mother. Eager to please his potential in-laws and placate his airless folks, Stewart convinces Alice to host a dinner at her home to acquaint the wildly disparate families?let the fireworks begin? Vanderhof's home is an oasis of sorts to a collection of eccentrics, some blood-related, who, tired of the daily grind, lead guiltless lives of blithe creativity and freedom of movement, nurtured by the patriarch's simple code: treat your neighbor well and do what you want. He's emblematic of utilitarian themes Capra will endorse again and again, and in him, Capra finds an endearing rebel who defies the notion that men must lead lives of "quiet desperation," giving timid, powerless sorts like Poppins (fittingly named Donald Meek) freedom from thankless toil. The great scenes of the multi-functional Vanderhof living room aglow with activity from all corners of the frame are simply and masterfully staged in long shots that give the impression of tiny particles of energy joyously unbound, zipping around a defined space. Here on, Capra will become more restrictive with his camera set-ups. The scope narrows in, for example, on one perfect shot in which the Vanderhofs and Kirbys are locked in a prison cell together after a hilarious night of intense culture-clashing and miscalculation, as the elder Kirby dumps a barely lit cigar in the direction of a hypnotized row of inmates who dutifully pile onto the ground to claw away at the prize. Although Capra will eventually say much more, here he indelibly expresses a troubling social imbalance that the remainder of the picture will earnestly attempt to rectify. It's a paradigmatic moment for a director not usually associated with evocative displays of visual rhetoric.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyably Offbeat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Entertaining characters, an interesting and creative story, and a talented cast make "You Can't Take it With You" an enjoyably offbeat feature. While Frank Capra, Jimmy Stewart, and Lionel Barrymore later had more famous collaborations, they also work well as a team in this picture. It must have been especially satisfying for viewers in the Depression, and it's still worthwhile now.The story makes good use of the set-up between Jean Arthur's family of eccentrics and Stewart's stodgy upper-class parents. Barrymore is believable and entertaining as the head of his household, and the house full of oddballs contains a lot of talent as well, with Spring Byington, Ann Miller, Mischa Auer and the rest all getting some good moments and some opportunities to use their talents. Some of the best sequences come when their characters are simply being themselves. Edward Arnold also adds a lot as Stewart's powerful father.Capra puts it all together nicely, and makes the story work even when the developments strain credibility. Although the movie has a clear message, all of the characters are treated sympathetically, which is not an easy task. This type of innocently upbeat feature is not appreciated now as much as it once was, but that's just a whim of current fashion that will end someday. "You Can't Take It With You" still holds up quite well for what it sets out to do.</fullReview>

This film conveys the same message, but I feel like it has more of an edge than "Life". Jean Arthur is always a delight to watch, and I think she gives this film its edginess.

		<shortDescription>Something that bankers born in 1935 need to know</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This exceptional movie was made in 1938, when my companion's parent's were THREE YEARS OLD. (She is 10 years younger than ME). Carol's parents and grandparents were bankers and she is amazed at the accuracy of the behavior of people that much older than those born in 1935. This movie is so incredible that Carol wants to purchase at least six copies: One for her banker father, one for her newspaper-publisher-daughter mother, one each for her grandmother's remaining alive best friend and one for her aunt. Plus one each to put on the dead bankers' graves. All of these people are 74 at the youngest, 95 at the oldest, and all of them can relate first hand to this movie. Carol wonders why they never explained banking that way. Why "banking" isn't personal anymore, and why, on God's green earth did these people who were only THREE YEARS OLD when Capra made this movie never were made aware of it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The classic sentimental Capra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A critique of the film; You Can't Take It With You could start with the character Poppins ( wonderfully played by Donald Meek) who is the culminated end product of The Wealth of Nations originally initiated by the celebrated Scottish philosopher Adam Smith. (B. 16 June 1723 ? D.17 July 1790) That is the capitalist's Utopia of the spread of wealth. When this wealth spreads, its gravitational pull ends with a man performing a mundane task for a pay cheque that ties him there. Ironically, Poppins is counting the wealth of his rich, miserly boss. As such Poppins is the extrapolation of Charles Dickens' Scrooge's hand found in the Auther's classic, Christmas Carol fable.This causes Poppins to rebel against his mundane life by creating innovative toys in his spare time. The problem is such innovation and creativity are hampered from reaching their full potential by his miserable job, which he feels he must do to pay the bills. That is until Grandpa turns up and (Lionel Barrymore) shows him the light.Grandpa invites Poppins to live with him and his family who are living the 'utopian' dream, full of creative bohemians. All are really a bunch of 'freeloaders' dependent on Grandpa. Likewise, Grandpa is dependent on his tenants who rent properties on his estate, for his income. Therefore Grandpa is similar to his nemeses Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnald). The difference lies in how their wealth is spread and the purposes it is used for. Where the latter wants to use his to accumulate more wealth, the former wants his to live a bohemian lifestyle in a type of pre-hippie era commune.Apart from these differences, Grandpa and Kirby both like power of sorts. Where Kirby gains his through the accumulation of wealth, Grandpa gains his through utilising his charisma and the propagation of his ideals. The mens' differences lead to a confrontation where one tries to undermine the other with their own specialised brand of power, one being charm, the other money.The power that winds up winning is Grandpa's as his is sentimental and appealing, and none threatening in an obvious way. It is further irony that Grandpa rejects the power of Bolchavic communism, Italian fascism and Amercan capitalism only to have amassed such power himself. But Grandpa's power is that of humanity, which prevails and triumphs in a predictive ending.This film could have influence Orsen Welles' Citizen Cain (1941) as it deals with the detachment from reality and humanity that obscene wealth brings. Nevertheless the film is quintessentially Capra. Its sentimental persona belies its more complex multi-layered story of power, corruption, humanity, greed and value systems.Overall You Can't Take It With You is deeply political which makes it controversial. Nevertheless, this is a great film, with a great scrip, production, direction and acting from a brilliant cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra Magic; You can surely take this DVD with you!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You Can't Take It With You was a stupendous effort by Director Frank Capra, yet it wasn't what you would call -- A Masterpiece. 8 years down the line Capra playing along the same theme improvised and perfected his work with "Its A Wonderful Life". I have the greatest regard for this director for the type of cinema he made had great emotional depth; how wonderfully he analyzed people, relationships, society and situations and presented it all on celluloid.You Cant Take It With You, is a great story which makes us realize that only wealth we really can call 'wealth' is the one we can take with us up there. The film mocks artificial boundaries set by social classes, a boundary which after 70 years hasn't been bull-dozed.Jimmy Stewart's first Capra film has him in a very subdued performance. The stars of this show are Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold and the lovely Jean Arthur. Story telling is flawless and the plot very witty. A good old gem of a classic you should watch and introspect!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say I'm a Capra fan, and I do acknowledge that his films are corny and visually boring. Yet I love them. There's something about them that appeals to me. YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU was a case in point. A much-maligned BP Oscar winner (and THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD should have won over it), this is still a fun, zany film, with Lionel Barrymore and Jean Arthur giving excellent performances. Stewart seems young and rather gawky, yet he's good with Arthur. The only thing wrong with it is that it is too long- a good 15 minutes could have been trimmed from it, and it would still hold up well. This will lift your spirits and make you smile!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barrymore is brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a brilliant performance just jumps off the screen at you, and in this film Lionel Barrymore does just that. His portrayal of the quirky but secretly pragmatic Martin Vanderhof steals the show. It is fascinating to watch the man work. His timing is impeccable and his delivery is so natural and sublime that it still resonates completely here in the 21st century.Frank Capra's greatest talent as a director, beyond the ability to handle a zany narrative with absolute aplomb, was that he would create a warm, welcoming atmosphere on the set. That is most evident here, where it is clear that all the performers completely enjoy each other's company. The great Jimmy Stewart, himself the acme of understated performance, noticeably defers to Barrymore time and again. It's clear he is simply reveling in the elder man's ability to make you laugh from the heart.Though the phrase has become a cliché, in this case it's most apropos: They Don't Make Them Like This Anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a charmer...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a movie! Full of life, joy, and the vivid differences between those determined to not take life too seriously and those who can do nothing but take life seriously and live life by artificial and pointless boundaries. This is a movie of such magnetic charm that today's movies that trawl in the quagmire of post-modern nihilism show even more the transparency of their aimless wandering.Lionel Barrymore caps off this utterly brilliant cast but I think in his own way Edward Arnold, the gruff, seemingly self-absorbed and money grubbing Mr. Anthony P. Kirby, is a kind of revelation in his role. You can see the transformation in his face as he realizes--finally--what a farce his life has been.I may be overstating this film's effectiveness, but it may not be a stretch to say it can change someone's life if they watch and truly pay attention to its message. What a great Capra movie (you'll see a lot of the same people from "It's a Wonderful Life") - sit, watch, and enjoy it!</fullReview>

This is where the heart of the story lies; when the two families philosophies clash. The story ends in a truly wonderful way that only Capra could pull off that you have see for yourself.

		<shortDescription>Adorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my view, the second best Capra movie and certainly the funniest although I belong to the minority view that It's A Wonderful Life is vastly overrated.On a technical analysis of Capra, other films may be better but few will leave you feeling so upbeat. This is a wonderful feel good film with some beautiful comedic and romantic scenes as well as some decent dramatic moments.Jean Arthur, always disarming, is at her most beguiling in this movie and the park bench scene where she playfully entices Tony to continue kissing her is utterly adorable. The hilarious nightclub scene is without a doubt one of the most perfectly crafted comedic scenes ever- I end up hiding behind my hands (right along with James Stewart) every time and few other movie scenes still have me laughing out loud 20 years after originally seeing it.While not providing the same dramatic opportunities of (say) Mr Smith Goes to Washington (undoubtedly the quintessential Capra movie which is nevertheless not my personal favourite), this film does ably demonstrate how Frank Capra knew that James Stewart would be up to the task of handling the final scenes in Mr Smith. Mr Stewart, as Tony, seems genuinely bereft in his scenes with the Vanderhoffs and his father following the dinner party debacle, to the extent that I often find myself looking at him wondering if he has lost weight! One further point to James Stewart's credit - he had the sense to recognise Jean Arthur as `the finest actress I ever worked with'.As always with Capra, the quality of the performances of the supporting cast is superb and the scenes between Lionel Barrymore and Jean Arthur are lovely as are the Vanderhoff ensemble scenes but for my money (hopeless romantic that I am) James Stewart and Jean Arthur on screen together is where this film shines - they made the cutest couple of the thirties, if not longer!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must confess this one was the first Capra's movie I saw in my life. And I must also say I really like it! I read something about him and I discovered this is a typical Capra's film once it's `funny, well produced, has a great cast and is enchanting'. Now I know I must go and look for more of his movies, and I'll do it!A young man (Stewart) falls in love with a beautiful girl and they set their parents meeting in her house. Her family is made of eccentrics: her father gave up everything in order to enjoy life, her mother writes plays, her sister dances in the middle of the room while she's assisted by a funny Hungarian teacher and her husband plays the music. They have a bunch of employees in their house who make fireworks in the cellar without any license. There's no necessity to say the young man's parents can't believe their eyes when they get there and witness all those scenes.Capra's way of showing all these facts is great. Everything is shown in such a pure and innocent way, that it's impossible to not have a good time while we watch `You Can't It With You'. The highly talented cast is also important in your enjoyment. Although the way of telling the story may seem innocent, there's a lot behind it. Capra was really worried about giving us a little more than just fun. There' a beautiful message in all those apparent madness, once the movie is about making friends and making good to other people, not only spending the time just thinking about financial success. That's the treasure the movie hides. I'm sure I didn't spoil the surprises, because you discover them as the story goes on. My rate 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Picture, Not as good as play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I should say that I played the role of Grandpa Vanderhof in a high school production of the play. I loved working with such a wonderful script, and it remains one of my favorite stories to this day.I enjoyed the quirkiness of the characters in this movie; however, they have been dummied down from the outrageousness of those in the play. The whole movie suffers from that whole early Hollywood "wholesomeness" that directors were either forced into or chose to stay in those days. Now the play was by no means dark, but it had a sort of edge that caused the family to be depicted as truly unique. Here, they're just a little strange, but nothing that would be noticed. I like how they really tried to add scenes outside the home, to make it more than just filming the play, but the added scenes don't have the charm of the original Kaufman/Hart script. They could have used a few more rewrites.The underlying story is good, and I especially liked seeing Lionel Barrymore playing the same role I did (I have to admit, he did a much better job). But if you have already seen the play, you probably will be disappointed slightly with this adaptation. It is still a worthwhile viewing, however.</fullReview>

Of course not all will be peaches and cream though as the two have very different families. Arthur's family, led by the priceless Lionel Barrymore, are eccentrics that just take life as it comes to them while Stewart's parents are well-to-do aristocrats that look down upon those who are not like them. Frank Capra is the catalyst in this funny and dramatic Best Picture winner of 1938.

		<fullReview>What marked Frank Capra movies for greatness was the fact that he was able to intermix comedy with poignancy, and the harshness of life all into one. This movie certainly does that as it is extremely funny with the crazy people who live together, then shows how life can beat you down, and then shows you how to beat it. many people say his movies are corny. Not so. they portray the reality of how life really is and for 1938, it was very difficult. His movies also show how simple life can be if you don't get involved in too many intracacies. (A lost art in itself.) As a person who was not living in 1938, but have several relatives who were adults and are still living from that era, it is a comedy that can identify with many people's problems from that time. It is a movie reflective of Frank Capra's values of getting to where he was by hard work, instead of people going to college to make movies and today give us nothing but a lot of noise and flashing lights and who have always had it easy and have nothing in their background to show anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra a Closet Commie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra was a brilliant filmmaker but his movies sure bring out the cynic in me. In `It's A Wonderful Life,' are we really meant to believe that the whole town and everyone in it would have fallen apart if James Stewart had never been born? Please! In the ever so tolerant household of Grandpa Vanderhoff, everyone is encouraged to be happy and live out their dream, but no one with the exception of Jean Arthur seems to be gainfully employed, so how do they keep enough food on the table to feed everyone? Most of the drudge work seems to be done by two black servants, but I notice that you don't see them eating at the same table with the white folks. And how come the IRS hasn't clamped down on Grandpa long ago for his refusal to pay taxes? And how would a real neighborhood feel if some nut had enough fireworks in the basement to disrupt the entire block when they go off? The movie's class-baiting, anti-capitalist subtext is so virulent you might almost suspect Capra of being a closet Red (could this household be a Socialist commune in disguise?). The sermonizing under the whimsy can get pretty thick. (I understand that the whole subplot with Arnold evicting everyone on the block to make room for a shady business deal was not in the original play.) So what's still good about this movie? The very funny nightclub scene with Arthur and Stewart is 30's screwball humor at its best, and the whole sequence in which the Kirbys arrive for dinner one night too early is exquisite comedy of embarrassment. Finally, the performances are so engaging that the fairy tail sentimentalism often persuades you against your better judgment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Liberal Taxpayer's Defense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the thing about eccentrics: They're not the best people to look to for a coherent ideology.So it is with the Vanderhoffs and Sycamores, a clan of crazy, loving, and lovable people who have decided to exit the rat race and follow their wandering muses... and boy, do they wander! Grandpa spends his days playing his harmonica and attending the graduation ceremonies of people he doesn't know. His daughter, Penny, decided to become the next George Bernard Shaw after someone dropped a typewriter at the home by mistake. Granddaughter Essie dances very, very badly, and her sister Alice, rebelling against her family of rebels, decides to become a banker's secretary (she still finds time to slide down banisters, though). Grandpa, it should be known, hasn't paid his taxes, well, ever, and his defense of this fact to the rather dunderheaded IRS agent who comes a'calling has been lauded by Tea Party types and abhorred by modern- day liberals as a polemic in favor of bathtub-sized government. Yet it should be noted that another resident of the house is on government relief and Grandpa seems totally fine with that. He may have thought through his rejection of soulless corporate America, but that doesn't mean he's right or consistent about everything. SPOILER AHEADWhat's more, for all his praise of the virtues of friendship over money, he actually betrays his friends pretty epically when he agrees to sell the house to a company trying to take over his neighborhood. While he does this only to in order to move closer to Alice, it nearly gets all his neighbors evicted!END SPOILERDoes all this mean that Grandpa is a bad person? No. Is he a questionable role model? Yes, and Frank Capra's attempt to make him a populist hero doesn't quite work. But you should watch and enjoy the hell out of You Can't Take It With You--it's touching, hilarious, and does contain genuine insights on how to live a good life. But don't go to it for a ready- to-serve political belief system. Go for the wish fulfillment: the chance to imagine doing exactly what you want with your life without fear of failure or poverty. I've got a good idea about what I'd do (drawing, acting, college classes on film appreciation, etc.), and I suspect you do too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>not only for splendid work of Frank Capra or for the high performance of Lionel Barrymore. but for the political, social, cultural analyze, for the wise manner to use a comedy as perfect tool for present realistic portrait of America. it is adventure and love and seduction and chaos and bitter references and joy and beauty in this film who seems be complete. because it has not only the ordinary Capra's charm but the force to be today more important than in 1938. same problems, more challenges. and a precise sketch about crisis, searches, solutions. and, sure, magnificent flavor of freedom. an evergreen movie. comedy, drama and a lot of humor. all as expressions of a great talent of director and the cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Truly a Wonderful Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are those who will hear the name Frank Capra and have a reaction along the lines of "Oh Frank Capra, sentimental, saccharine, manipulative rubbish". I don't make apologies when I say that dismissing a film for being sentimental is the nonsense film criticism to end all nonsense criticisms, it stinks! Newsflash, stories have been manipulating people's emotions since the dawn of time. Pulling of effective sentimentality is a skill, and I have not come across a single good reason as to why it is a problem. You Can't Take It With You is Capra at his most sentimental, manipulative, saccharine and all those other dirty words, and I love it for that. So if that's the crime of the century, then lock me up for life.The Sycamores are the ultimate eccentric family, in fact eccentric probably the right word, there are complete nuts. They live a counter cultural lifestyle of not working or playing taxes (and somehow getting away with it), and doing whatever makes them happy without a care in the world; people who aren't afraid to live. There are like cartoon characters who can twist their way out of any situation with people more in tune with reality, such as when Grandpa Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore) manages to convince the timid Mr Poppins (Donald Meek) to stop throwing his life away working as bureaucrat and start having fun. The movie feels ahead of its time and like something which would have been written in the 1960's. The family's refusal to pay taxes is ethically questionable, even though Barrymore gives some interesting and humorous rebuttals to not paying taxes (perhaps Wesley Snipes could have used some of Lionel Barrymore's logic in court), but it's a movie fantasy, it could never happen in real life.One the sweetest, most heartwarming scenes in any film ever is when Grandpa Vanderhof tells Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur) about how his love for his deceased wife, ugh, it just kills my poor little soul; a perfect display of Capra's gift for directing very intimate, emotional scenes in which the rest of the world ceases to exist. I'll also always remember Barrymore's monologue on "ismmania" as profound words of wisdom ("when things go a little bad nowadays you go out and get yourself an 'ism' and you're in business"). What's particularly striking about Barrymore's role as Grandpa Vanderhof is that he character is the polar opposite of the role of Henry F. Potter he would play in Capra's It's a Wonderful Life. Likewise there doesn't seem to be any actress whom James Stewart didn't share a great dynamic together. James Stewart and Jean Arthur share a perfect chemistry together, pairing the embodiment of the everyman and the embodiment of the everywoman.You Can't Take It with You has only earned a status of a minor classic, but in my view is Capra's most overlooked film. There's so much fun to be had with this film, it is the perfect 30's comedy. Capra-corn and proud of it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Splendid Capra!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young banker falls for an attractive secretary, who lives in the kooky, eccentric family of Grandpa Sycamore. When the banker's parents meets this family, not only are they surprised of how crazy their personalities are, but of the way they want to live their lives. And that's what succeeds the most about You Can't Take it With You. It's a classic screwball comedy, but its heartwarming message sums up the overall film as a whole, that while we may have untold riches and wealth, without the love of friends and happiness, you're a complete and utter failure. Lionel Barrymore gives likely one of cinema's most profound characters to grace Hollywood cinema, as his speeches about laid-back happiness and eternal optimism are so true, even in today's faster-paced society. There's also great performances from Jean Arthur and Jimmy Stewart, and like the message, the comedy is flawless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Capra directed this Academy Award winning comedy that stars Jimmy Stewart as Tony Kirby, Vice-President of a huge company run by his father Anthony(played by Edward Arnold). He is engaged to an employee, a stenographer named Alice Sycamore(played by Jean Arthur) She wants to introduce both families by inviting them to dinner, but doesn't consider just how different both families are, since her grandfather(played by Lionel Barrymore) is a free-spirited iconoclast who hates wealth, the opposite of Tony's father, who is also purchasing the whole neighborhood, but Barrymore is the one holdout! Her family home is inhabited by assorted eccentrics, who make the dinner quite memorable indeed...Amusing screwball comedy is undeniably contrived and fairly predictable, but still quite funny and appealing, with many pertinent things to say about wealth and happiness that still ring true today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anthony P Kirby (Edward Arnold) runs a large corporation trying to force Martin Vanderhof to sell his home for a monopolising commercial development. Vanderhof is digging in his heels, so you can imagine how well they get on as in-laws when the Kirbys' golden boy Tony is betrothed to Vanderhof's beautiful granddaughter Alice Sycamore. Tony's bright idea to surprise them and bring his parents over unexpectedly resulted in probably the most disastrous meet-the-parents ever...quirky families need prior warning if they are required to act normal. Alas there was no warning given and they all ended up in prison...how? Watch it and find out! I did rather like the judge played by Harry Davenport, quite a character, and Mrs Sycamore's use of a kitten as a paperweight is a real "awwww" moment. Donald Meek played charming inventor Mr Poppins, stuck in a mundane job and rescued by Vanderhof; though his character faded away and seemed quite pointless given the initial screen time. Mrs Kirby was very snobby and holier-than-thou, however we didn't really get a chance to get to know her much deeper than that and her development in that area was not explained. Given solar panels weren't commercially available until the 1950's I was intrigued by Tony's musing if they we could learn to pull power from the sun's rays "we could take all the power we need right from the sun". Although love in movies always faces trials, it was interesting that there were no love triangles or other potential suitors...there again things were crazy enough as they were. The film was fun to watch with an amusing mix of madcap antics (the restaurant scene is hysterical) with a warm plot and good morals. The cast worked well together, which is essential for some of the crazy scenes they had to synchronise!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Capra Goes to Wall Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upper-crusty Wall Street banker Edward Arnold (as Anthony P. Kirby) wants to buy up all the land in a happy little community, but cranky lower-class Lionel Barrymore (as Martin "Grandpa" Vanderhof) won't sell. Somehow, the townspeople and Mr. Barrymore hold out, although everyone in a twelve block area has presumably moved. Complicating matters, Mr. Arnold's new vice-president and son James Stewart (as Anthony "Tony" Kirby Jr.) has fallen in love with his stenographer Jean Arthur (as Alice Sycamore), who is coincidentally Barrymore's granddaughter. She's the sanest member of a household full of eccentric relations...Screenplay writer Robert Riskin does a fine job adapting the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart for film. Giving a special focus to Barrymore, with crutches added to allow for the legendary actor's increasing physical challenges, and the delightful Donald Meek (as Mr. Poppins) are two noteworthy additions. For the medium of cinema, there couldn't have been many directors better suited for the job at the time than homespun Frank Capra, who guided the comedy to "Best Picture" and "Best Director" honors in the annual "Academy Awards" poll. With an award-worthy best ensemble cast, it's a winner.********* You Can't Take It with You (8/23/38) Frank Capra ~ Lionel Barrymore, Jean Arthur, James Stewart, Edward Arnold</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is strictly recommended to those who love Frank Capra's films and especially It's a Wonderful Life(1946). The movie is an unofficial prequel to It's a Wonderful Life, i felt. Lionel Barrymore has given a performance that will be remembered by every movie buff.The son of a banker falls in love with his secretary, who hails from an eccentric family. I wondered how on earth would they would be a couple, considering the weird people in her family who are insouciant. They have no steady income, don't pay their taxes and make explosives without a license. Tony loves Alice for what she is and gets along with her family for being unique.Tony brings his parents to Alice's place and the Kirbys couldn't have been more terrified. When a police raid results in the accidental explosion of explosives, all the Sycamores and Kirbys are sent to the prison. Anthony Kirby disparages the lower and the middle classes much to infuriate Vanderhof. Vanderhof tells money doesn't matter when you have no friends who would lend a hand at the time of crisis. He also says "You can't take the money with you" when you die but you'll leave with the memories and the people who have made your life worth it.Alice leaves the town to stay away from Tony and her pompous snob mother. When the Wall Street collapses, Anthony's counterpart loses his trade and dies with a heart attack after enlightening Anthony that money doesn't matter in life. Tony pulls his father out of the living oblivion by offering his resignation as the vice-president to lead a more moral and ethical life with people around. Anthony cancels the biggest deal that could skyrocket his bank and goes to meet the Sycamores who are about to vacate their house and apologizes for being rude. He realizes how many helping hands the so-called "eccentric middle class family" had at the time of vacating their house for their harmony and friendship with the people of the remaining blocks. He turns a new leaf.The Kirbys and Sycamores merge into one single entity.The movie was surely a laughter riot. I love the scene in which Mr.Vandehof rejoinders to the questions put by the man from Revenue department. This movie will remain the one close to my heart for a long time.</fullReview>

From the kindly/nutty/philosophical old grandpa to the offbeat son-in-law who likes to just print stuff as a hobby and play the xylophone just for the heck of it. The whole film is full of these offbeat characters but the ending is not so offbeat. It's plain and simple...would you rather die and be known as a greedy, heartless and hated by all...or...would you rather be kind, generous and loved by many?

		<fullReview>Wealthy, powerful banker in New York City--stymied from completing a profitable merger by none other than the wily grandfather of an unflappable middle-class family--learns that his son, whom he is grooming to become Vice President of the bank, is romantically involved with the old codger's granddaughter. George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's Pulitzer Prize-winning play gets the Frank Capra treatment, meaning that the early comedic scenes are great fun while the third act is weighed down with lessons-to-be-learned. Jean Arthur and James Stewart are a whimsically off-center pair of young lovers whose fuzzy, low-keyed chit-chat bubbles with comfortable chemistry. Even better are Arthur's devil-may-care relatives: Ann Miller as her ballet-minded sister, Dub Taylor as her xylophone-playing brother-in-law, Spring Byington as her fanciful mother, and Lionel Barrymore, wonderful as her grandparent (on crutches). The film's infectious view of a hearty family living without fear is effervescent and charming...but when the crowds rise up at the end, one class of people versus another, and Capra trots out the soapbox, some of that good will begins to seem forced. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some films of course contrive to divide opinion by deliberately courting controversy and/or being little more than unashamed propaganda for whatever cause is dear to the hearts of writer and director or, to put it another way and paraphrase Malvolio, some films are born controversial, some achieve controversy and some have controversy thrust upon them. In the case of You Can't Take It With You which I watched for the first time last night as part of a Frank Capra season I found myself divided even as it unspooled. On the one hand I was prepared to succumb to its charm, applaud the eccentric family at its centre, led by Lionel Barrymore and boo their natural enemy, ruthless capitalist Edward Arnold, but even as it became obvious that Arnold was going to develop into a latter-day Scrooge, and join the metaphorical 'workers', my practical mind was saying that bankers just don't become bums in the real world however much we would like them to. It was more than interesting to watch with hindsight Lionel Barrymore opposing big business with the knowledge that ten years later in yet another Capra film he, Barrymore, would play a character (Potter) that made Edward Arnold seem more like Bob Cratchit than Scrooge. But that's the thing about movies, the best ones Entertain you first and then allow those who will to discern the message beneath.</fullReview>

It is a touch overlong, however this is such a minor fault compared to how wonderful it is. The direction is excellent, it has a well written and constantly engaging story and the script sparkles. The film looks beautiful too, and the music by Dmitri Tiomkin is gorgeous. Then there is a jewel of a cast. Lionel Barrymore is a revelation here, and Jean Arthur and James Stewart are both superb.

		<fullReview>Upon reviewing this title, i found myself rewinding certain scenes because of their beauty. This romantic brand of comedy was visually pleasing and also bestowed a good level of simple comedy. I must admit though, there were parts that i found to be extremely ridiculous, which did turn me off. There was a certain scene in the park where the little gang of kids with the acordian that stuck me. The coordination with the song and dance was really delightful. A couple sitting in a dimly lit porch, necking, and dancing with children was my favorite scene. There was a lot of humor that i enjoyed in the film, simple little humor that some wouldn't pick up on, but for me it struck a cord. I enjoyed the look back into the eyes of the social scene in the 1930's. The clash between classes, the way of words, and the styles are all something that really stuck out for me. The humor in this film is intelligent, it makes you think, unlike most mainstream comedies of todays day and age.</fullReview>

The film is slightly longer than two hours, and able to indulge in leisurely spells of spending time with the Lionel Barrymore character's family, who are constantly colourful in joyous, infectious ways. Regular people using their good nature to contrast themselves with the rich and powerful is always fun to see in Frank Capra movies, too, making the climax a touching one.

As these folks are now facing older age &amp; death, they are finding out they can't. This movie points out values our social fabric needs back as high technology &amp; greed extraordinary have given us a baseless society.

		<fullReview>So it's not like Frank Capra was known for making especially gritty films, but even at that this film is light stuff for him. It's entertaining enough but not very memorable. And the chunk of plot that was added for the movie version--the lengthy courtroom scene--attempts to open the movie up and give us some of that traditional Capra aw-shucksness, but it feels like exactly what it is--tacked on material that was never meant to exist in the first place and only succeeds in making the film feel longer than it should be.It's got a good cast though. Jean Arthur is always adorable, and I'll watch a movie just because she's in it. Spring Byington plays the dotty family matriarch, a stock role in 30's movies, very well. The best performance probably comes from Lionel Barrymore: he seems beleaguered by a world that just won't let him and his family *be*, and your heart goes out to him.Not a bad way to spend a couple of hours, but you'd do better to watch "It Happened One Night" if you have a taste for screwball Capra.Grade: B</fullReview>

At a time, when the unemployment rate was over 20%, this business was making a huge contribution to the economy, and paying large amounts of tax in the process.In contrast, Grandpa has apparently not held a job for years.

		<shortDescription>Means well... probably!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knowing Capra's other films, I have to assume he meant well. But if you watch You Can't Take It With You with fresh eyes, what seems to come across is weird capitalist propaganda.The message seems to be: it's okay that some people have ALL the money, because they're not really happy. And it's okay that the average family is getting screwed over, because... well, they know how to dance, and play the harmonica. (And the slaves really didn't mind picking cotton twelve hours a day, because they got to sing those great Spirituals. Yeah, right.) Sandwiched in between the Great Depression and World War II, that sort of message seems particularly evil. "First, we swindled you out of your life's savings, now we're going to send you off to die for us. But it's okay, because, heck, we're not really happy about it."I can't believe that's what Capra meant to say. But that's what came out.On a story level, too, there are some really ugly messages. In a film like Mr Smith Goes to Washington, for example, the Everyman character fights like hell and manages to win one small point of justice. In You Can't Take It With You, the big, fat rich bastard MIGHT not knock the poor family's house down, depending on his mood... but either way, there's nothing they can do about it. If only this dismal view were presented with irony! Instead, we're apparently meant to cheer for these beaten people, no longer capable even of facing reality.Think how different the Sycamore family would have been had a Mr Smith lived there: letter writing campaigns, protests, picketing... membership in the communist party... Whoa; that can't be right! Hmmm... maybe it was exactly that inevitable conclusion that prevented Capra from following through his own logic. In Mr Smith Goes to Washington, the villains have committed several heinous crimes; in You Can't Take It With You, the property developer is operating quite legally. Mr Smith wins out by reaffirming the inherent rightness of the system; in the case of the Sycamore family, only overturning the capitalist system would help. Fortunately, we're spared that unsettling revelation, because, conveniently, the big, heartless property developer actually has a heart of gold. See? The system works! (Unfortunately, it's the feudal system.)You Can't Take It With You has many entertaining moments, and nice performances by some of Hollywood's most wonderful stars... Just don't step back and add it all up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure why I had avoided watching this film for so many years, although I had caught snippets of it on television every once in a while. But, finally I sat down to watch it in its entirety. No question, this is definitely "Capra-corn", and it's delicious.For me, one of its most interesting aspects was the performance of Lionel Barrymore. A few days earlier I had watched a film where he was the villain, and here he was his most charming, lovable (and crippled) self. What a wonderful actor he was.And there is the bevy of character actors...some recognizable by name, others just by sight. But in this film, they are the core of the story -- a bunch of eccentrics living together in a huge house that is the target of a rich corporation...owned by the father (Edward Arnold) of Jimmy Stewart, who just happens to be in love with Jean Arthur, the granddaughter of Lionel Barrymore. But before I move onto them, let me get back to the character actors: including the delightful Spring Byington, a very young Ann Miller before her MGM years, Donald Meek (you'll definitely recognize him), and Eddie "Rochester" Anderson...just for starters.Jimmy Stewart was well established in films by this point, but he is still so young looking. He is great in the love scenes...plays them in a rather understated manner that seems very real. Jean Arthur is an interesting actress...so good...and yet I have always had the feeling that she fit perfectly in that particular era of films, and after World War II never quite fit again. Probably the strongest performance in the film, though it develops mostly later in the film, is that of Edward Arnold...watch for his change of perspective...a true acting gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With this delightful and very 1930s creation, Frank Capra produced his second Best Picture winner and earned his third Academy Award for Best Direction. It is also the third time he had been granted permission to have his name above the title. Ah Vanitus Vanitatum! Methinks the glory had gone to his head somewhat.You Can't Take It with You is, as it happens, very well directed, so let's focus a little on that first of all. In contrast to his over-sized ego when it came to packaging his productions, Frank Capra at least was pleasantly subtle behind the camera. He concentrated most on simply and clearly framing the actors with long takes and uncomplicated backgrounds. He rarely uses attention-grabbing techniques, and when he does it is usually worked neatly into the flow of the picture ? for example a whip pan in the fast-paced opening scene, or the matching up of shots between the closing of the lift doors and the opening of the serving hatch, which gives a memorable introduction to the home in which most of the action takes place. His simplistic approach to the quieter moments of intimacy gives them a lot of weight, especially when compared to the bustle of most of the other scenes.But there is much more going on here that cannot be attributed to the able hand of Signor Capra. We have another great script by that genius of the 30s screenplay, Robert Riskin. It's a fairly loose and very cinematic adaptation of the George Kaufman/Moss Hart stage play, which is in itself a lovely story. But Riskin has given it a pace that will work on the screen, as well as adding many of his own touches. The character of Mr Poppins is Riskin's invention, as are many major scenes, such as James Stewart and Jean Arthur's talk in the park, the subsequent "Big Apple" routine and the business in the restaurant. The result is faithful to the tone of the original play, but also feels as if it was original material written for the pictures.And now we come to the cast. This was an era in which most performers, leads included, were not so much chameleons becoming absorbed in character as we expect them to be today. Many of them had one persistent persona that allowed them to fit into the right kind of role. This wasn't a weakness because they still acted well and engaged the audience, and indeed it was the familiarity and likability of these players that made their pictures work. You Can't Take It with You is one of the best examples of this. Take the wonderful Jean Arthur. You could really believe this is the sort of family she comes home to when she leaves the studio at night. When you look at Jimmy Stewart across his career, it's as if you're seeing the same man at various stages of his life. Watching him here it's easy to forget that he was relatively unknown at the time, but still his demeanour must have made audiences immediately warm to him. Through and through this is a tale of characters ? the Lionel Barrymores, the Spring Byingtons and of course the Donald Meeks.Frank Capra, crafty director and shrewd producer as he was, could still not have made a joy like this without equally skilled collaborators. Although he was yet to make two undisputed masterpieces after this (Mr Smith Goes to Washington and It's A Wonderful Life), this is probably the personal highpoint of his career. Capra's failure to accept art as a committee was to be his undoing, and he would find it harder and harder to get a consistent team. Yes, the name above the title was a great one, but the ones under it were pretty special too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familiar Capra theme about not being too driven in life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a central theme that is often seen in many of Frank Capra's other films - that you should see the more simpler aspects of life and not become too obsessed with success and power. Many of the Depression era movies seem to have a somewhat anti-capitalist tone in them and it is understandable given the heavy emphasis on profit making just before the market crash. This movie has an engaged couple (James Stewart and Jean Arthur) with one living in high society (Stewart) and the other in a lower class community with eccentric relatives. The movie has a common theme of class and status conflict that comes out of attempted unions of differing backgrounds. Edward Arnold plays the rich dad while Lionel Barrymore plays the lower class grandfather. The movie's main message of not putting too much emphasis on making money and to enjoy the simpler things in life fits with many of other Capra's films. There is even a scene involving an IRS agent who tries to collect on back taxes from the lower class family. The scene was taken in a rather humorous light with the Lionel Barrymore refusing to acknowledge any debt to the government. His rationale sounds much like many of the stances taken by tax protesters of the current time. This movie seems to share the theme and casting from "It's a Wonderful Life". Lionel Barrymore who played the money grubbing villain in the later movie instead is the anti-profit "hero" in this movie. James Stewart's role in this movie appears to not be central as the George Bailey role in "It's a Wonderful Life". The movie is a good screwball comedy that won the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars in 1938. Personally, I think the storyline and plot were better developed and acted in "It's a Wonderful Life" than this movie. The later movie also received Oscar Best Picture and Best Director nominations, but did not win any Oscars. One of my favorite screwball comedies, "My Man Godfrey", also received nominations, but won no awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie with a moral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this isn't my favourite Capra film - I found it quite long and dragging - it does have a moral and is well acted and a good story. I saw It's a Wonderful Life before this and it was great seeing Lionel Barrymore play a genuine, kind character - such a contrast from Mr. Potter! It was also nice to see Ann Miller in her younger days - she was about 14 or 15 in this film. Unfortunately I found it extremely long and quite draggy in places so I was quite desperate for it to end. Great acting, good moral, great story... but too long for me. It would have been a lot better shorter. Nevertheless, a good film, but not one of my favourites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wonderful feel-good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting to read some of the comments about this movie. Since it's rated highly, obviously most of the comments are positive, but I find the negative comments pretty funny. Most people rave about Lionel Barrymore, while a few people thought he was terrible. Most people thought the movie was hilarious, others claimed it was un-funny. The story was either relevant or contrived. Certain scenes were either superfluous or poignant. The rest of the cast was either adorable or annoying. Most of the really critical comments come from people who saw the play first. It's quite common for fans of a book (or in this case, a play) to be disappointed in the movie. Maybe it's a good thing for me that I never saw the play. I happened to think the movie was terrific. It wasn't hysterical, but it was very amusing. It may have been preachy, but the message is as relevant today as it ever was. The acting was as good as it gets, at least from the main players - Lionel Barrymore, Eddie Albert, Jean Arthur, and Jimmy Stewart. If you don't enjoy this movie, you either have a heart of stone or you're analyzing it too much. Movies today that rely on potty humor (or worse) to get laughs, or special effects rather than truly talented performances to make points, can't begin to compare to this one. There's not an actor or actress around anymore (at least in Hollywood) who can deliver lines like Jean Arthur or Lionel Barrymore. It is a great film that makes you feel good all over. Who cares if every single aspect isn't 100% believable. If you can't tolerate anything less, watch a documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the 1930s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very, very funny film - guaranteed to make you laugh! A young Jimmy Stewart, plays a character not enthusiastic of following in his wealthy businessman father's footsteps and falls in love with a somewhat "normal" woman from a VERY eccentric household (kind of like the blonde in "The Munsters") where no-one has full-time jobs but does whatever he likes to do. The problem is that this is the one household that won't sell out to Stewart's father who wants to buy all the lots in the surrounding neighbourhood to build a factory. The film's message is: don't worry so much about making lots of money because "you can't take it with you" to the afterlife - spend your time enjoying life to the fullest. Like a novel of Dickens, we are presented with many quirky characters here in a comedy that is so much fun to watch. (10 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT OSCAR WINNING CLASSIC FILM of 1938 !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra deserved an Oscar for his direction of this great classic film with all time great classic actors. This film warms your heart with a great clean and pleasant story along with plenty of laughter. As well as, a sweet romance between Jean Arthur (Alice Sycamore) "Shane"'53 and James Stewart(Tony Kirby)"The Big Sleep"';78. These two actors seem to be made for each other, both being rather dippy in the head about many things, like kissing on a desk and at the same time talking on the phone. Lional Barrymore (Grandpa Martin Vanderhof) gave one of his greatest performances as a wise old man who knew that the simple things in life were more important than riches and great ambitions and gave Edward Arnold(Anthony Kirby) "The City That Never Sleeps"'53 who thought money and power was everything in this world, soon learned a very important moral lesson. Ann Miller(Essie Carmichael) "Too Darn Hot"03 lived up to her reputation as a dancer, who was rather heavy at the time. If you look real close, you will see Eddie Rochester(Donald) who was "Rochester" of the Jack Benny Radio &amp; TV Fame. A great film veteran Harry Davenport( Judge) "The Farmers Daughter"'47 proved that a Judge had heart and justice, he even tossed a coin in the collection for Grandpa Martin Vanderhof's fine. This film is about family life and about the simple ordinary people in this world who are richer than they will ever believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Whimsical, Very Capra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "You Can't Take I With You" as a high school stage production when I was 13 years old. Obviously, I don't remember much about the play itself, except that it did involve an unusual family in their home. Frank Capra's film version is yet another notch in his "feel-good" movie belt, which includes "It Happened One Night" (1934), "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" (1936) and "It's a Wonderful Life" (1946).Lionel Barrymore (great-uncle of actress Drew Barrymore) seems quite at ease at Martin Vanderhof, patriarch of the family (and host to the eccentric guests) within his home. Edward Arnold's performance as Anthony P. Kirby would seem almost cliché by today's standards. It would seem that his acquisition of property in order to construct a factory in order to force his rival to do business with him is his only goal. As for Jimmy Stewart, he's always been good in "aw-shucks" roles, and this one is no different. As Kirby's son, Tony, Stewart comes across (quite accurately) as a young man who is an idealist and dreamer, and not the future banker his father wants him to be. I should note that Tony once thought about the possibility of solar power, something as fictional in 1938 as faster-than-light travel is today. But I digress...The entire Vanderhof household consists of people who pretty much do as they wish, whether it is dancing all the time, writing plays (simply because a typewriter arrived by mistake), playing the harmonica, even making fireworks in the basement! The message in "You Can't Take It With You" is simple: The pursuit of the pleasures of life will give you more riches than all the money you make.This is a nice little film, very whimsical and very Capra. It's not his best work, but it still holds up pretty well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the funniest and heart-warming movies of the 1930's, "You Can't Take It With You" was the first teaming of Frank Capra and James Stewart. The film has a dream cast- Lionel Barrymore is the eccentric head of an even crazier hosuehold of relatives and drifters. His fellow occupants include dancer Ann Miller, her xylophone champ husband (a young Dub Taylor) Donald Meek (who creates monster masks in the basement) Samuel S. Hinds (who creates fireworks in the same basement) Jean Arthur (the sane grand-daughter. You would swear she's the model for Marilyn Munster!) My favorite scene is the verbal square off between Barrymore and tax collector Charles Lane. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

Kolinkoff is riotus, DePenna es muy Comico, Grandpa is something else, Penny is humorous, Essie is too funny with ed, and Donald and Reba are too funny together. Poppins was something to desire, and Gay Wellington was dropped, really made the film not as fun. This movie had it moments as well. I personaly love when The Kirby enter/ every man for himself bit. The stuff just before that is pretty funny too. However, my favorite scene is when the basment is blown to bits. This was a very good movie, but is not very good when they have the added scenes. The reason I say this is I was Depenna when Grandview Hights high School did it just last year. Extremely good, but not great or The Eggs Done Fell In The Sink!</fullReview>

He wants to marry her but she lives with her VERY eccentric, poor but loving family headed by her grandfather (Lionel Barrymore). Stewart's parents do not allow him to marry her...and Arnold is trying to run them out of their house.I never saw the play this based on, but the movie is wonderful! Barrymore is in top form as a warm, lovable man (a totally different character from what he played in "It's a Wonderful Life" 7 years later), Arthur is fresh and appealing and Arnold is very good too. Also Spring Byington and Ann Miller are good in supporting roles. Surprisingly Stewart is just so-so--he seems uncomfortable.The plot itself is old (rich vs. poor) but the screenplay is great and the cast give it their all. Barrymore telling Arnold off in a jail cell is a highlight. The only debit here is the last half hour--the laughs stop, the film becomes quite dark and it gets too preachy. Still it has a happy ending (totally unbelievable but I loved it). This deservedly won Best Picture and Best Director of its year. I give it a 10!</fullReview>

They have taken away scenes which were pivotal and timeless. They have taken an amazing work of a art and mutilated it, and then tried to put it back together with cellotape. A DISASTER! The only saving grace of this movie is the actor who played Tony, and some fair acting by the rest of the cast, but otherwise, this movie is a 2 on the scale.

		<shortDescription>"As near as I can see, the only thing you can take with you is the love of your friends"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd forgotten how therapeutic a bit of Capra-corn could be. I sat down to a pleasant romantic comedy about two lovers overcoming their class differences, but ended the film practically in tears ? tears of joy, as only Frank Capra could produce. 'You Can't Take It with You (1938)' was the first of the director's collaborations with Jimmy Stewart. However, the heart of the film actually centres around another familiar Capra face, Lionel Barrymore ? who, never to be forced into retirement by his painful arthritis, acts the entire film on crutches. Forget the dastardly Mr. H.F. Potter, his Martin Vanderhof is the "richest" man in town, not because he has very much money, but because his kindness and sense of community has made him more friends than he can count {this is a theme that Capra used regularly; see 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936)' and 'It's a Wonderful Life (1946)'}. But the daughter (Jean Arthur) in the hopelessly-eccentric Vanderhof family has fallen in love with the son (Stewart) of a rich banker (Edward Arnold), incidentally the poorest man in town.An evening with the Vanderhofs is something akin to a Marx Brothers movie, with each character doing their own thing without regard for what outsiders might think. While some family members test fireworks in the basement, sister Essie (Ann Miller) practices her ballet to the xylophone music of her husband (Samuel S. Hinds), as her uptight Russian instructor Boris (Mischa Auer) complains that everything "stinks." Mother Penny (Spring Byington) attempts to finish writing a play, and Alice (Jean Arthur) slides down the staircase banister. With twelve activities happening at once, it's the farce of 'Arsenic and Old Lace (1944)' without those troublesome murders. But behind all this chaos is the unmistakable unity of a close-knit family, and (as in many Capra films) it only takes a recognisable musical tune to bring together the Vanderhofs ? and the snobbish Kirbys ? for a collective performance that is genuinely charming in its sincerity. At least you can always be assured that a Frank Capra film will always leave you feeling good about yourself, the world, and the people in it.Alongside the compassionate performances of Barrymore and Edward Arnold, enjoyable performances are also given by James Stewart and Jean Arthur, such that they repeated their love affair in 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939).' 'You Can't Take It with You' was adapted by Capra-regular Robert Riskin from a successful play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. I found it interesting that the screenplay bore what appeared to be a socialist slant, with Martin Vanderhof decidedly rejecting capitalist labour in favour of performing his preferred tasks for a minimum wage. This approach, we are shown, leaves one happier and assists the wellbeing of the entire community. I'm not so certain, however, of Vanderhof's insistence on not paying income tax, on the basis that he's not getting anything back from the government ? this doesn't seem socialist, nor does it sound particularly "American," either. Even so, everybody can sympathise with the notion that money isn't everything, and that a single kindhearted gesture can go much further than a thousand dollar bills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1938 Oscar winner for best picture and director was absolutely terrific.Sociologists must have had a field day with this film for dealing with rich vs. poor in society. This topic was handled in a refreshing true spirit way by a genuinely fabulous cast.Am very much surprised that Spring Byington was the only cast member nominated for an Oscar for this worthy film. She was up for best supporting actress but to lost to Fay Bainter for "Jezebel." Edward Arnold and Lionel Barrymore should have easily been considered for best supporting actor, the latter as the unconventional head of a dysfunctional,zany family and the former as the definition of Mr. Capitalism.The picture provides non-stop hysterics as the Vanderhoff family comes into view. It turns much more serious after the hysterical scene where everyone is carted off to jail. In the following mayhem, we see the distinction between rich and poor in the cells as Arnold and his wife, fabulously played, by Mary Forbes,seems to only have contempt for the impoverished jailbirds.How Arnold eventually comes to his senses is marvelously depicted. This film was another fine example of Capra's constant subject matter dealing with Americana.</fullReview>
