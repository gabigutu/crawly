		<shortDescription>Tarkovsky's Final Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsky was without a doubt one of the genuine artist working in the cinema. With films such as "Andrei Rublev", "Solaris", "Mirror", Stalker" and "Nostalghia", Tarkovsky enriched the world with powerful works for art. "Sacrifice" was his final film, made while Tarkovsky was dying of cancer. The story concerns an elderly academic who lives with his family in a rural part of Sweden. When he learns that about an imminent nuclear war, he makes a desperate pact with God. The film is astonishingly beautiful, like all Tarkovsky's films. Images of nature, water and fire feature prominently, as does the shifting from colour images to black and white.It is important to remember that Tarkovsky is not a very accessible film-maker, and his films make great demands on viewer's patience and attention, but if you are willing to make the effort you will be rewarded by an unforgettable experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best movie I have seen so far. I watch it again about once or twice a year, like a ritual or an annual holiday I would be taking into levels of consciousness where the mind is not really required. I do not understand, and I do not feel like I have to, it is secondary. I feel touched like only pure and silent beauty can touch me, or bliss. It is obviously created around an idea of sacrifice, being both a gift to others but also to ourselves. By offering his life in order to save his family, his grandson and the world, the main character is also giving a true meaning to his own life that had mostly been of artificiality, questionings and shallowness. Every person who enters the house, he starts seeing under a deeper if not more expressionistic light... And when he meets with magic (while making love with the witch) he creates the bridge that will take him from reality into mystery. The whole film is as breathtaking and self-sufficient as a painting, or even more so, a Russian icon. It is ageless. I suppose it will remain with me for my entire life. I consider it Tarkovsky's last will, but even more so a piece of the Human Heritage that should be protected and kept accessible for future generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect example of the difference between true cinema and the Big Macs that Hollywood feeds us.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarkovsky's death bed film certainly lacks some of the fire and energy of his earlier work, but the story of Alexander's search for faith amidst the worst kind of madness is by no means dull. The cinematography and editing are obviously Bergman influenced, but anyone who says that it bothers them to see Tarkovsky borrow the style of another needs to learn more about Eisenstein, Kuleshov, and perhaps Wajda.This film serves as a stark example of the real difference between the work of the European authors and Hollywood. While viewing, keep an eye on the editing. Th film opens on a five minute long shot in which it is extremely difficult to even discern which character is speaking. The scenes are made up of as few shots as possible and the shortest shot of the entire film is about 10 seconds. There are less than a dozen close ups in the entire piece, which may be why American audiences with their limited attention spans, would reject the film. The Sacrifice might not sit well with Tarkovsky purists, but it's themes and philosophy, I feel, surpass in depth, any of the master's other works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just registered to the database, and this is my first review that I've written for it. The first film I thought of was The Sacrifice, Andrei Tarkovsky's final masterwork, and in my opinion his best. This film affected me like no other, and forced me to look at Tarkovsky in an all new light, as a spiritual creator. See this film, I guarantee it will change your outlook on life if you give it the chance. It is the most challenging, spiritually invigorating film I have ever seen, by truly the greatest cinematic poet/visionary of all time. Tarkvosky is the future of cinema, the one who carried the torch, the one whom all aspiring cinematic artists should look to, and a genius who passed far before his rightful time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmerizing, Spellbinding Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sit here, agog, with the holy terror of wonder and amazement at the immensely tender spirituality which this film has bestowed upon me. This is my second Tarkovsky film...and now I am hooked. I am not going to be very successful in explaining this movie to anyone -- even to myself, so forgive the sketchiness of these reflections. THE SACRIFICE is a revelation to me. The level of pathos I feel right now is overwhelming -- something that has occurred too infrequently in my life. This film regards the human soul as the most precious commodity possible and life as it's most ample celebration. "Time cannot vanish without trace.." Tarkovsky has said. And so the time that Tarkovsky spent on this Earth, has been well spent and he has left more than a trace for future generations to wonder and ponder at.I adore Tarkovsky's images, so lovingly photographed here by SVEN NIKVIST. Most remarkable of these images are the final settings where everything comes to a point...even THEY have dialogue made up of great silences packed with intensely significant emotions which have come from the protagonist's culmination.The choice of music here is also deeply personal and wildly original in its contrasts and penetrating meaning. In the final strains, we hear first the modern and timeless Asian sensibilities of Watazumido Shuso. After which a great silence of visual narrative we are offered a spiritual selection from some of the most beautiful music ever written -- Johann Sebastian Bach's St. Matthew Passion.All of these, combine in one's mind's eye and heart to provide the thoughtful viewer with one of the most spiritually satisfying endings of any movie I have ever witnessed.The movie seems long but, it really isn't as long as you might imagine. I suppose it is because so much of the narrative is not splashed into our senses -- ready for regurgitation. There is much we must work for. There is much for which we must contribute our own viewpoints and form our own conclusions.But then life isn't filled with dialogue in the conventional sense...it is more packed with our own thoughts and our own decisions -- as so is this film. It allows you to conclude many things on your own. Isn't it kind of Tarkovsky to have been so benevolent to us and our panoply of thought-patterns? We come to this movie all with our different characters and personalities...Tarkovsky thought of this.And he offered us a masterpiece - where we were the mental protagonist who made the endings for each us - our own -- and yet all different -- but the same, after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow but satisfying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite possibly my favourite film. Quite why I'm not always sure -- perhaps this is really a rather pretentious film ? Perhaps one in which a long time is spent without engaging the audience ? One with perhaps the most unlikely postman one might meet outside of a Bergman film set ? But, from the moment the camera opens lovingly on the icon, to the closing as the ambulance drives away, I find myself captivated, and drawn back to watch again. As with Tarkovsky's other films, certain images linger long in the memory:"little man" watering the ikebana, the levitating witch, the crashing milk jug, the roar of the jets. For those of us cursed with a lifetime of weekly wage slavery this is a fine restorative film for the spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, binding, and supremely terrifying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to find words expressive enough for Tarkovsky's final--and perhaps greatest--work. One could briefly explain some of the plot, but that would mean nothing. This is a film that speaks of terror, of faith, and above all, of binding promises. An intellectual, living in a remote and beautiful cottage is celebrating his birthday with friends and family--when war is announced. Promises of life, and of death are the main premise of the film, and one cannot walk away from it. This is the sort of film that terrifies, ensnares, and draws you in, so that no matter what the moment, you cannot rip yourself away. Filmed with supreme skill and incredible beauty (every separate shot is breathtaking), this is a film that forces you to look at your life, your premises, and your entire evaluation of existence.The question of liking or disliking this film is unimportant. Undoubtedly there will be people who will dislike it. But the one thing that is indeed impossible, is to remain indifferent to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Altogether a Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a spare and haunting work that weaves its spell slowly yet powerfully. Every shot is framed with loving care, and Tarkovsky allows the camera to remain fixed on a scene as events unfold. It's perhaps the most beautifully photographed film I've ever seen. There's very little music during the course of the movie, yet subtle, mysterious sounds contribute to an overall feeling of mystery and foreboding. The acting and dialogue are no doubt greatly influenced by the work of Bergman. Perhaps the film is a kind of homage to him.This is definitely not a popcorn movie, nor one to see on a first date. I recommend you see it when you're not distracted or impatient - when you can be fully present and mindful as events develop at an unhurried, organic, human pace. The cumulative effect is devastating, yet somehow wonderfully cathartic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Tarkovsky is one of the five inventors of cinema, and the one most disconnected from the constraints of reality. He is highly intuitive, visually rooted of course and deliberately eschews the necessity of making narrative `sense.' The magic of his earlier masterpieces (`Rublyev,' `Mirror') is precisely in how he sustained a reality with highly folded, irrational causality.But as he grew older, he became celebrated and ineluctably developed `theories' of his approach. He began speaking and writing about his work and slowly slipped into the safe harbor of making sense. This film -- his last as it turns out -- is the result.Along the way, he allied himself with Bergman, someone who always was rooted precisely in the simple narrative. Bergman's heritage is the theater. He begins with `real' life, abstracting and staging elements of it. Bergman's whole point is to make the sense of the situation easy to read so that he can intensify and embellish it. Life is real, and because we can enter the reality of a Bergman film, we can emotionally relate to it. Bergman's world is allegorical, real, and causally connected where Tarkovsky's is metaphorical, ultrareal with causal folding.So it is a strange voyage for Tarkovsky to convince himself of the logic of his theories, and to journey to Bergman's doorstep.This film has a strongly Tarkovsky-ite beginning (until the map) and end (the last 47 minutes beginning with the visit of the actor to the witch or -- depending on your tolerance -- perhaps a few minutes before with the vision of the small house). In between, there is a muddle of emotional angst that is clumsily inserted. Also, it may be my imagination, but all the cinematography seems different than his earlier work. His early eye was languorously curious, lingering and floating. Here it is Bergmenesque: deliberately fated, smooth with premeditated and goals with foreknowledge of the fate.To see what I mean: look at the documentary included on the Kino DVD. That documentary is flatly stupid in plumbing the mysteries of Tarkovsky (it elucidates his `theories'), but it does include the remarkable original shot of the transition from the witch's visit to the post-holocaust peace. The original is pure Tarkovsky: a shot of the actor, then panning to a scene with the same actor surrounded, then a continuous movement through visitors, reflections, players in the magic, the world, and a remarkable image of the nude daughter corralling chickens. Only that last image remains in the final version which is reduced to Bergman-like clarity. It is dramatically economical, but Andrei's poetry is lost. It is a dead tree planted with high hopes.This package: the film, the documentary on the film and the book, are proof that artists are often not the best source of insight into their art. This film, alas, is not "The Tempest," a self-referential perspective on an artist who understands his own magic. It is instead an echo of that artist's misunderstanding of himself.Must be seen for that alone, preferably after "Prospero's Books."Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you give this film the attention and patience it deserves, you will be greatly rewarded.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please forgive this disorganized, vague rambling...it is difficult to put into words what this film has done for me, as it is a spiritual experiment in time and character more than it is a traditional film.I will say right off that this movie is not for everyone. Tarkovsky is a fan of long takes, slow character development and awkward silences. Even though this is one of my favourite films, it was a struggle to get through the whole thing...which is, in fact, an effective medium to describe a man who is finding it a struggle to progress with his everyday life. The settings are fittingly dreary and dismal; indeed, his son seems to be the only spark of life in the film.There is no plot to speak of; the film is an in-depth character study. Tarkovsky has given the main character so many dimensions that one cannot help but wonder if it is semi-autobiographical. Elements of magic realism serve to enhance the character's despair and isolation, but there are finely-crafted human details -- such as a shaking hand that must try twice to light a match properly -- that give the film a very realistic sense. The world Tarkovsky has created is like a vivid dream.The images in this movie are incredible: watch for his use of fire, wood, earth and water, for all four elements are heavily drawn upon in his shots. There is a documentary floating around out there that has Tarkovsky discuss this film in depth; it shows the processes he invented to create some of the takes, and the stubbornness he exhibits to get everything to match his vision perfectly. I saw the documentary before the film, and I think it only added to my appreciation. His book, "Sculpting in Time," also offers insights and bits of philosophy that add dimensions to this movie.Though I regret that Tarkovsky passed before he could produce more works like this, "The Sacrifice" is a fitting epilogue to his collection of films, and perhaps the best eulogy a person could ever hope for.</fullReview>

"Sacrifice stirs the soul" "Sacrifice devastates as well as it rehabilitates"....you get my drift...An almost mythic blend of haunting imagery, rich audio cues and astounding performances, this masterwork of introspection spins a sublime poem on the conundrums of faith, unconditional love, the nature of reality and the very meaning of sacrifice. I cannot help but be moved me truly, madly, deeply.By the time a boy rests by a lonesome tree, I realized few films will come close to injecting me with such revelatory euphoria.

		<shortDescription>SPOILERS: Kierkegaard would have loved this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Read this after you see the film once, and before the second time, since this film is certainly worth seeing again!As a woman who grew up in a spare, cold climate, I don't find the landscapes bleak. We are watching the middle of summer, with everything (but the one tree) growing and thriving. The rains are relatively gentle compared to the winter snow. The windows are open to the light breezes, and the light never leaves the sky. When it seems that disaster has struck, the fen is not panicked. The dapple of the leaves doesn't stop when the rush of planes has gone by.By comparison, the interior shots are overly ordered and spare. The inside is Alexander's mother's garden, after Alexander prunes it. Everything is in order, and the beauty is pretty much gone. The moment order is disrupted, things fall apart. The English wife bursts into hysterics and declares she can't stand it "anymore." This is not the wail of someone who has suffered a sudden shock. This is the wail of a woman who has seen her foundation swept from beneath her, and is forced to confront her existential realities.Otto and Maria are obviously out of place in this orderly, petty world. We know that Maria is the best kind of witch -- but what is Otto? Is he collecting the incident that happens in the house that night? Is he collecting the incident with Maria?Kierkegaard wrote the answers to most of the questions asked, either in Sickness Unto Death, or in Fear and Loathing. Recommended reading -- if you get through this film, you can certainly get through Kierkegaard. ;)To me this is a film that pits romanticized fertile nature against the restriction of (Christian) predestination, pits hope against despair. The Japanese found aesthetics in the most despairing circumstances, even where there was not hope. Alexander feels trapped by civilization, by his ordered and cowardly life -- yet he moves to sacrifice himself to save it...or to escape? Does he redeem his family, or remove their chance to transcend their petty patterns?Resist taking the first part of the film as monologue -- perhaps you have never had a child? Little Man is old enough to think for himself -- he proves that by the end of the film. He has listened to every word his Papa speaks to him. His father is answering questions that the boy can't ask, or doesn't know that he should. Papa Alexander is trying to pass on what he has learned so his son might have a better chance (or, paradoxically, so his son can grow up with comfortably similar delusions?). At the end of the film, we realize that Alexander's son has questions that his Papa will never answer.Finally, I have to note, on the closing scene -- for those of you who are not familiar with botany -- the dead tree seems to be planted head in the earth, with the dead roots in the air. It is a project out of touch with nature, and like the rest of the film it offers a prayer for a miracle, or the evidence of utter psychosis.Now, read Kierkegaard, watch the film again, and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Andrei Tarkovsky Does Ingmar Bergman, Philip K. Dick Style?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrie Tarkaovsky's final film takes elements from Ingmar Bergman, "I Am Cuba" with a story that if not influenced by, is a kind of psychic cousin to the later works of Philip K. Dick. A family on a small Swedish island, find out the world is about to end(there's nowhere to hid and nothing that can be done)...planes heard overhead, and television warnings are all anyone knows. So far this doesn't sound too different from Bergamn's "Shame" where a couple try to escape from the world and war, on a similar small Swedish Island. The difference is where Bergman, dissects his characters down to nothingness, Tarkovsky includes mysterious post-men obsessed with miracles, a maid who may be a powerful witch, a man with the chance to re-create the universe, and a love making scene in mid-air? That Tarkovsky moves with such subtly between psychological study, religious allegory, and science fiction tropes, should'nt be too much of a surprise considering his early philosophical SF films like "Solaris", and "Stalker"(which I may re-watch, cus of this film, though I hated it before). Like Philip K. Dick, end of the world paranoia, reality manipulation, and the religious (specifically Christian) ecstatic vision all merge together in 'The Sacrifice", with a lot more force and clarity(at least for me) than in any of his earlier films. The lead character seems like a stand in for Tarkovsky himself, his views on nature, art, God, progress, and humanity, seem to match pretty closely with some he gives in the interview section of the DVD. It's still slow as all hell, but the intensity of the story helps balance out the visual pace. It's not as instantly impressive as some of Tarkovsky's other films, but I think this maybe his strongest movie, all around. It's the story of a man who saved the world, without anyone ever knowing it, and the trade off, man must make with God, in order to survive. A prayer on film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult but worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor spoilers. This is not a film for everyone, and probably not a film for most. However, if you like art, it might be a film for you. The director, Andrei Tarkovsky, viewed film as art and his films make few, if any, concessions to commercialization and marketing. If you are looking strictly for entertainment, you may find this film to be slow, boring and depressing. However, if you are looking for art, then you should not ignore this film.The artistic merits of the film are considerable. The theme is an individual's relationship to God, politics and mankind in general. How can a sensitive and intelligent person come to grips with these huge and sometimes overwhelming parts of life and still keep his own integrity in tact. Just attempting a subject like this is courageous and laudable, but in doing so the director walks dangerous ground. It is so broad that no film can truly encompass it, and wisely Tarkovsky doesn't try. Instead he shows one man's attempt to deal with it - flawed and inadequate as it may be. This is a clever way to approach it, because it stimulates you to start thinking of what your own approach might be.It begins in color, with Alexander, a very self involved and disconnected man in his later years who is forced by circumstances and a very odd mailman, to confront his relationship to God, and society. This causes Alexander to go through different mental states which are filmed in black and white or muted color. As the day moves forward, Alexander eventually sifts from a passive observer of life to someone who is committed to playing a dramatic but positive and active role in the spiritual and temporal life. With this new reality, the film returns to color. The composition of the sets the framing and the editing of the film all are carefully done to support and emphasize the theme and development of the film. The film takes place on one day, Alexander's birthday (yes, this does have a double meaning). Throughout the film death is the looming and persistent presence. Near the beginning Alexander rightly observes that fear of death will drive people to do many foolish things. We see some of these foolish things as the characters of the film become unfaithful, hysterical, and even cruel and destructive when threatened by death. Tarkovsky himself was facing death by cancer when he made this film and this was his final film. In the end, however, the film is life affirming, leaving us with a view of hope and even joy.This is a film I respect but it is not very entertaining. I am glad I watched it, but I wasn't really ready for it when I started. If you are not ready to see a film this serious and deep, then it would be easy to dismiss it as difficult and even painful to watch. But to do so would be a reaction to that same fear of death that seems to be the root of so much evil in the world. Understanding that this is a film about serious topics that effect us all and not a casual bit of entertainment can make the difference between appreciating and valuing this film or not. But even though the film had some difficult and soul searching moments, you will enjoy the end and its message of hope. The final image of the film is a young boy bringing life to a dead tree. It is a truly beautiful image and one that think will stay with me for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, Powerful, Philosophical, Art at its greatest form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsky's swan song "Offret" ("The Sacrifice") is composed of 112 long takes and sequences, almost without any cuts, planned scenes just like a stage play with enormous acts whose dialogs are rich, powerful and filled with insights on life, death, philosophy, sacrifices. It sounds like a film directed by Ingmar Bergman and there's no secret that this was Tarkovksy paying a tribute to one of his favorite directors, filming in Bergman's famous island used as scenery in many of his films; some actors who worked with him and the habitual cinematographer Sven Nykvist are present in "Offret".In one the finest performances ever captured on film, Erland Josephson lives the journalist Alexander, a worried man about mankind's destiny who tells to his little and mute son, called 'Little Man', about how doomed we are, but also tells him good things too, teaches him to plant a tree and all. On the day of Alexander's birthday the Third World War breaks in and this time we and the characters have the feeling that now the world really is gonna end. As last wish, Alexander pray to God wishing to have more time to live and in exchange he'll give up his family, his belongings and his house. I don't wanna keep wavering about where the plot goes and show the thoughts I have about the film, I'll leave that to you reader. Instead, I'll keep my focus on some of the beautiful things presented here, some of my favorite moments and the physical aspect that I found interesting about "Offret". As I said earlier, this film looks like more a work from Bergman than a work from Tarkovsky, and for the die hard fans of the Russian director might not be so appealing since he uses the visual to tell his stories in most of his classics but here he depends on dialogs and more dialogs which is quite rare in his filmography. Tarkovsky composes along with Nykvist two worlds in one: a beautiful and colorful island with green trees, a sunny place; and the devastated place with dark tons, shapes, very dreadful, creating an apocalyptical world without any kind of expensive scenarios. He uses the cinematography and a subtle and powerful special effects to destroy the world.Here are the things I won't forget about this masterpiece: 1) Alfred's prayer, one of the most emotional and heartbreaking moments ever made, filmed in one long shot; 2) the house on fire burning down to the ground, beautifully filmed; 3) The jar of milk smashing on the floor when the planes appear showing us that the war begun; 4) The story described by the postman about his 'collection' of events; 5) Alfred's monologues about art, death, life, fear. Tarkovsky's idea flying in its fullness. 6) Alfred visiting the only one who can help him, Maria the maid of his house. 7) The desperation of Alfred's family when the world's end. 8) The first scene with Little Man and his dad planting the lonely tree (which also ends the film with Little Man's first quote), meaning the creation of life, a hint of hope. 9) the ending, absolutely perfect.It is art and philosophy at its highest point. And it's sad that this Tarkovsky last film in the way that I really loved his change of style here, I was looking forward for more films like this but it simply didn't happened. Life was taken away from him very early but we're left with interesting and great masterpieces like this, "Stalker" and more. One of the most beautiful pictures ever made and must be included on a list of films that you can't get out of your head. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing end to an astonishing career.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This last film by the great Tarkovsky and seen as an article of pure faith by many, suffered from production problems, the largest being a camera jamming which resulted in the cast and crew pulling together to rebuild a set so that the film could be completed. Tarkovsky had suffered worse, not least the loss of an entire film due to a lab fault back in Russia. His chief problem was adjusting to the more formal structure of crewing in the west as opposed to the freedom afforded him back in the Soviet Union. I think the main problem affecting this film is it seems unduly influenced by Bergman and has the same cameraman. The hysterical women on the floor especially reminds me of 'Cries And Whispers'. Mimicking another's style, even one as great as Bergman's, diminished him somehow. Also, I can't pretend to understood the plot which at times seemed eccentric to the point of obtuseness and silliness, not least the rather too sudden appearance of an ambulance and the puzzling business involving a witch. Why anyone should suspose such an involvement would prevent a nuclear war is perplexing. Also the tired use of yet another levitation motif suggested Tarkovsky may have been running out of artistic steam. On the plus side there is an enigmatic soundtrack of what sounds like sheet metal work, suggesting spiritual discord perhaps?Whether one engages with a Tarkovsky film depends on whether you identify with whatever spiritual problem his character is wrestling with. Some people are more concerned with nuclear issues than others. Some may see the sacrifice made by Otto as an inspiring spiritual one against his own interests. Certainly Tarkovsky seemed enamoured of the concept of the holy fool, weak and perhaps misguided and foolish individuals who are disenfranchised but in their lowliness somehow admirable and insightful on some matters. Others of a more secular persuasion may see Otto's sacrifice as selfish (his family being affected) and merely the pointless actions of the benighted. I'm sitting on the fence. The final sequence, which for the reasons above had to be re-shot is sadly not one of Tarkovsky's best. He has this need not to edit for the audience and prefers scenes to run to their own inner dynamic. It didn't work for me.Tarkovsky was dying of cancer during the making of this film and the watering of the withered tree is actually an older myth, ruminated upon in his extraordinary book 'Sculpting In Time'. It is about 'the truth' as he sees it and is a Christian one. Unfortunately, I don't think this film was all it could have been but I see why it means so much to many. In my opinion he was perhaps the greatest film maker of all time and we are unlikely to see his like again. He believed that the gift of friendship was the most natural and important one to give as it is the one most open to us all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Spoilers*** I have read Tarkovsky's theories on film, and although I don't agree with a few of them I do, however, admire his dedication to his ideals. 'The Sacrifice' was nothing short of magnificent. I understand a lot of its shortcomings, but that doesn't in the least take away from the overall picture.Tarkovsky mentions in his writings that a movie is not a finished entity when even 2 minutes of footage remain before the final cut. His reason for this seems to be that it is more important to pay attention to the overall cinematic experience. With those 2 minutes taken away you are taking away the films natural rhythm and flow. Now, he does have incredibly high standards for his films, and in doing so creates almost unreachable standards for himself and for his fans. But, where a film like 'Solyaris' seemed to deviate from its intended message, i find that 'The Sacrifice' hits it dead on. Dead on. The film uses no gimmicks to draw you in...the opening scene is very very slow. The main character gives you a long drawn out monologue and then chides himself for being a big windbag. No pretense there. Little errors immediately become clear - the boy ties a rope to the tree and the bicyclist rides off and you expect him to get stopped by rope - but it doesn't work. You figure this is because after a 9 minute scene Tarkovsky didn't want to spend the money or time to re-shoot it...NO. This is what would've happened in real life - the child's scheme would've been flawed, because he went about it like a child would...light-hearted with no intent to hurt, just whim. In fact, I find the whole film to be childlike - and that's why so many intellectual and technical snobs aren't connecting with it. Tarkovsky let some things go their naturally...that's Tarkovsky.My praises don't end there. The performances were all so natural -the intended horror of the situation was dependent upon them...and executed to Tarkovsky's desired result, I'm more than sure. The plot unfolds very dreamlike and you have no clue as to what is real, and what is not. The end scene is a clumsy and chaotic episode where you think the director or writer just threw it together with no regard for realism...Heck no. There is more to that, and I'm just beginning to grasp some things that will probably take more viewings to better understand. But if I never do, who cares? I was left feeling as satisfied as I have ever felt from any movie. This is now one of my all time favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the soul of the artist/poet with his profound 'swan song', an elegy to life and death and the soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is perhaps too blunt a notion that Andrei Tarkovsky's the Sacrifice bears some comparison with Ingmar Bergman's films. More than a notion, it's right up there on the screen: Erland Josephsson, one of Bergman's great collaborators, as well as Sven Nykvist (probably the best), as well as certain allusions in some of the shots (i.e. the kid in the bed in black and white seems right out of Persona). But it's also the themes being dealt with, the tone in the monologues from the characters (albeit from Josephsson and usually dealing with his faith and memories), and the sense of grief and bewilderment ala Shame. At the same time, with these allusions as well as others to the likes of Nietzche and Dostoyevsky, it's through and through the work of a filmmaker so in touch with his soul as an artist, with so much to pour into a work that has relatively little plot (not that it doesn't have a story), that it floors one.And, in a sense, it's close to being, despite its darker intonations and its ambiguous, staggering ending of madness and hope, the director's quintessential work. While Stalker will probably stay as the artistic pinnacle of his career, the Sacrifice brings to a head many of the director's chief concerns while not possibly making them too patched together to make sense (i.e. The Mirror, which is nevertheless also great), as well as in a style that is meditative, calm, harsh, surreal, and always with the heart and mind of what leans toward the poetic. Once we get into the premise of the picture, which takes a little while itself to set up- an old man, Alexander, (Josephsson) and his family are at his home to celebrate his birthday when elsewhere a catastrophic war is going on, with the family left to their own devices out in the middle of the countryside- Tarkovsky explores the spaces that are there to see in the consciousness of men (and, to a degree, women) in a crisis of faith.In reality, there isn't a whole lot that "happens" in the usual plot-driven sense of the Sacrifice, but within the realm of the scenes depicted and acted, there's a lot more than any other filmmaker would meet at. A visit to Maria, a "witch" in a church nearby, takes up a fairly significant chunk out of the picture, but in it is a story told by Alexander about a garden and his mother, and around this and in this scene are the details that Tarkovsky builds with. It goes without saying his genius also lies with whom he works with, and Nykvist creates such a mood for each particular scene (sometimes the light or look of a scene will fade just a little, and everything will change, however subtly, for an instant), and such a delicate, brooding nature with the camera as it tracks along in Tarkovsky's carefully lined long takes, that it ranks up there with his very best pieces with Bergman.But at the same time, as the director mixes in black and white footage, slow-motion of a character running down a hall, a tilt up some mud and nature, a sense of time and place and horror is depicted, honestly, without the problems with usually pretentious visionaries. And as it was that Tarkovsky knew that he was dying- unlike other filmmakers who fade out after their last picture or die unexpectedly- there's a sense of self-reflection, as it comes out with Alexander and in those around him, that is sad but ultimately poignant to the highest order. Questions are raised that can hardly be answered, but one of the chief ones has the ring of naiveté until it's known that it's this particular instance it's raised: is there no hope for the spirit? What about the boy, however, might also be another sort of question, as we see the final shot starting on the boy and raising up ever so gently up the tree with the music playing on.All these and more can be raised from the Sacrifice (not to mention, of course, what does it mean to really sacrifice oneself), but it's besides all of that just a truly rich cinematic experience, one that's so rich that it's hard to take it all in all at once. It has the sustainability of its artistic force to not have the danger of growing 'dated'; to make a more leap with some grandeur perhaps, as with a poem or some renaissance painting (not far off from the Leonardo featured in the film), the Sacrifice asks to be revisited, to have the experience of the thoughts and ideas poised, and for the amazing performances and technical work. It's one of the true masterpieces of the 1980s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The overall effect should be as important as it's premise. Possible Spoilers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pauline Kael once said that "movies took their impetus not from the desiccated, imitation European high culture, but from the peep show, the Wild West show, the music hall, the comic strip - from what was coarse and common." Andrei Tarkovsky, in his relatively short career, dismissed cinema's original intent, it's coarse nature that Pauline Kael referred to, and used cinema as a way to move the viewer to meditate on his or her spirituality. THE SACRIFICE, Andrei Tarkovsky's final film, is yet another film of Tarkovsky's brilliant catalogue, which emphasizes the importance of faith and spiritual reflection. THE SACRIFICE is a hard film for some to figure out. Personally, there is not one film playing in the nearest theater from which I write this review that approaches the relevance that this film conveys. The movie is about a man with a lucrative career that takes some time off with some family and friends to an isolated location. He appears to be pretty well off until he gets message that war is imminent. He prays to God, in one of the most intense moments in film, and promises that if God ends the war then he will disown his family, burn his house down, and stay silent for the rest of his life. The war ends.... That's as far as I'm going to go because I want you to have the opportunity to see a film that rises above cinema. The film, however, does not reveal if God responds to the prayer. Whether he does or not is not what THE SACRIFICE is about. It's about the actions that we perform in order to be closer to God, and some people respond more intensely than others.Great movies about spirituality are all but gone from today's cinema. Most come off as either to corny, preachy, etc ... Unlike those ridiculous exercises, THE SACRIFICE is a smart film. It's beautifully crafted, the acting is terrific, and the direction is top notch. It is a film that has moved me to reflect on my own spirituality as well, and I can truly tell you that few movies have done that to me. I really appreciate THE SACRIFICE; it is a film that has produced an important effect in my life. Now how many movies can do that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To fully understand this film; you need to know a few things about Russians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILER: A Western viewer needs to know a few things about Russians to fully understand the meaning and significance of this film. One item of particular significance is the magnitude and nature of war. The film states that a nuclear conflict of some sort (limited or unlimited is not clear) is imminent or has already started. Certainly the noise and vibrations due to the noise of the jets flying overhead indicates that war is about to break out. Now, war damage is actually something of an abstract meaning to Americans; all of the battles fought by our military in the wars of the 20th century were in far off places. Though there were exceptions with Pearl Harbor, the torpedoing of merchant ships of the coast of the United States during the early days of WWII, and of course the events of Sept. 11, 2001 the truly great battles were elsewhere and people who lived in the center of our country, in the countryside such as shown in this movie, were not directly affected or attacked. Now, nuclear war would probably bring about death and destruction even to the Heartland of the United States but that is hard to grasp for most Americans as this sort of war has never happened.However, the Russians (or Soviets at the time of the making of this film) did suffer tremendous destruction throughout their country in WWII. And, this destruction did affect most of these people. In fact, wars in the past before WWI and WWII (such as during the Napoleonic era) have also caused terrible destruction in Russia. So, to the Russian viewing this movie, the terror shown by the actors is very well understood. War to the Russian is not generally sending troops across oceans to fight but rather fighting the enemy in one's front yard.The other matter that a Western viewer needs to know to understand this movie is the very superstitious nature of the Russian people. I had long thought that the most superstitious country in the world was probably somewhere in Africa or the Caribbean. It may be, but the most superstitious country with any sort of development is undoubtedly Russia. Those people are very sincere in their belief in Astrology and any other superstition that they have ever heard of. The movie is not being factitious when a woman is cited as being a witch. They still believe in such people in Russia, though the nature of witchcraft there is somewhat different than the traditional depiction of a witch in the West. And, quite a few employers in the former Soviet Union probably believes that one of their servant women could be a witch.And, most people in Russia could believe (for the sake of the film) that a witch MIGHT actually be able to do something to stop a war. Who the witch is and what, if anything, she can do in this case is something you have to see the movie to find out. Sufficient to say though, that belief in the supernatural is still quite common in Russia, and must be taken into account when seeing this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another cliché for self-absorbed miserable humorless intellectuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Nykvist's always spellbinding cinematography, and I have liked some other Tarkovsky films, I had no problem with the slow pace or empty shots, actually would have like the whole thing better with none of those annoying people in it. But sorry, I can only explain the misplaced reverence for this film as credit for his earlier work, and respect as his career and life was ending. However, this film is the kind of thing that has made "intellectual" a dirty word in the US. Just what we need - more artful glorification of the cliché that being an intellectual means being a spoiled rotten self-absorbed, self-pitying terminally miserable humorless neurotic, who has it all but does nothing but desperately search for reasons to feel sorry for himself. This film asks deep questions? Sorry but I was only 12 when my intellect questioned and rejected the ridiculous idea of a "loving" all powerful god getting sadistic kicks from demanding "sacrifices". This film limply accepts that lame-brained dark-ages scam of religious oppression with a whimper. But why not when the sacrifice involves every old rich white guy's fantasy of banging his hot young maid! Some sacrifice! Of course he manages to turn even that into a downer - sheesh! Can't be an "art" movie without a topless maid! Class oppression - even making the maids wear uniforms in the 20th Century - is another sickening idea that is accepted without comment or critique. The idea of there being some eco-idealistic message in burning a house is also silly as hell. He obviously had no problem owning a house that would take the energy use of a small country to heat. Guess it doesn't matter if it impresses the neighbors. And people say this is about teaching the next generation to do better? Are you kidding? It's sad that there's an art-house audience for such pap, when Greenaway can't even get a release in the US these days. So... this is the film for you if you're no longer satisfied with depressive navel gazing, and you're so desperate for miserable self-absorption that you'll bend over and stare at your own anus, so then you can complain that something smells bad, and you have a backache too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>merits a re-evaluation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story takes place in an isolated location on the isle of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Although the island has a long semi-independent history, it has been an "official" part of Sweden for more than three centuries.Many of my reactions to this film are the common ones: this film is "Bergmanesque", a little different from yet not discontinuous with Tarkovsky's others; the images are striking and almost overwhelmingly powerful; the film is long and slow ("stately" to say it positively), so much so some won't have the patience to even finish watching it.I think though the story is more complex and subtle than is often stated. Supposedly the topic is a slightly off-kilter person giving up what he loves in exchange for the salvation of others as a reaction to the specter of nuclear war. After all, his life circumstances look pretty attractive to us viewers: wealthy, respected, private, and comfortable. The ominousness of the opening dialog doesn't seem warranted.But I think it's more than that, or at least more ambiguous than that. The main character isn't just slightly off-kilter, but close to collapsing completely. His life has become unbearable. And his motives are as much about "punishment" (or even "revenge") as "sacrifice".Why do I think that? For starters, how is it that the only people that will come to Alexander's birthday party are his doctor and his postman? That guest list sounds to me like an act of desperation, an admission that he's hit rock bottom. Alexander's wife is so neurotic even her daughter and her lover chide her. His daughter can't grow up in such an isolated place; she never sees anyone else anywhere near her age. And as far as her obvious age-appropriate interest in boys, there's nothing more than a bad joke about the postman being her beau. She flips between acting like she's ten and acting like she's thirty, with nothing in between. Alexander sleeps on the couch in his office rather than in the marital bed , and everyone acts as though that happens all the time. When he bicycles to his servant's house (or at least dreams he does), along the way he sees the doctor's empty car with his wife's shawl; clearly he's aware that his wife is having an affair with his "best friend". His servant's immediate reaction is "something terrible must have happened at home", and it's apparent this isn't the first time she's seen Alexander's home situation become intolerable. And the doctor's plan to move to Australia is a truly momentous, one-in-a-million attempt to escape forever. The doctor's calm, detached, slightly ironic bearing belies the awfulness of the words he speaks about just how dysfunctional Alexander's household is.</fullReview>

When the movie was recorded i was there with my grandfather and there was nice to see a live recording when you are about 12 years of age and never been close to something similar.Unfortunaly when they was about to burn down the house they experienced some heavy rain, so they had to build up the house twice, if i remember my history correct.

		<shortDescription>My first Tarkovsky... still in awe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the gentle beginning to the harrowing yet satisfying end, this film commanded me with an inexorable pull in its sublime images. In what extent this depended on the collaboration with the Swedish cinematographer Sven Nykvist, I wouldn't really know. Suffice to say that I deeply admired Nykvist's work in such Bergman films as "Jungfrukällan", "Nattvardsgästerna" and "Fanny och Alexander"; after viewing Tarkovsky's "Offret" this admiration has turned into a kind of love I normally reserve for separate movies or perhaps actors. The shot near the end with the burning house and Alexander running around in delirium is to die for: it's unbelievably beautiful, and still hauntingly terrifying in its destructiveness. I would watch this film only for its visual (and aural) qualities and still be happy just to absorb the bleached art of the cinematography and the meticulous mise-en-sc?ne.Of course, this would all be somewhat shallow and empty if Tarkovsky had nothing more to offer. Thankfully, "Offret" has enough depth, spirituality and pathos to do its visual virtuosity justice, and even with energy to spare. Though many of Tarkovsky's cinematic elements are mystifying, they can be enjoyed and provide epiphanies on different levels of the mind and spirit, much like music (Bach not the least, exemplified by the perfect choice of opening and closing piece from the St. Matthew's Passion). The slow and elaborate pacing only heightens the tension and is necessary for this sort of cathartic journey.But for some scenes in the middle where it stumbles and just plods along for a while, "Offret" is in my mind perfect. Watch the suggestive movement of the ethereal curtains in the little boy's room, like divine breathing from without (or within?). Notice the exactness in the moving and placing of characters in a room to achieve symmetry, seamlessly done with flowing naturality. This is art done by a master, and the world seems a lesser place without him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A trinity of holy fools</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarkovsky's last film is one of those perfect last film, a last testament. Tarkovsky heard he had cancer when he was editing the film. Still, he had been sick for some time so who knows how fear of death influenced his script and filming or what he knew unconsciously?It was made in Sweden. Tarkovsky was a refugee, missing his home country, his life there and especially his young son. Tarkovsky borrows many of Bergman's collaborators, including Sven Nykvist on camera and Erland Josephson as Alexander, the protagonist. Alexander is really Tarkovsky's mouthpiece. He has the same religious and political views and the same taste in art. Sacrifice is in fact not very Swedish at all. It is a Russian film through and through, with very Russian characters speaking Swedish. Tarkovsky even filmed it in Gotland because it looked like Russia. The whole film is very personal. The little boy is like his own son who he missed terribly. The wife in the film is just like his own wife in Russia and the story about how they found the house is in fact how he found his house in Russia (and the house in the film looks like the that house).The original idea for the film is found in a script he wrote and called The Witch. In it a man dying of a cancer has sex with a witch and is cured. He leaves all his riches, family and friends and follows the witch into poverty. While Tarkovsky was filming Nostalghia he got the idea of adding an apocalyptic scene to it, an all out nuclear war. While keeping the witch in the script he added a deal with God also, which has confused many viewers. I personally don't get the confusion. It can be read in at least three ways. One that he is a desperate man who makes deal with anyone willing to make it, to safe mankind and his family. Or that he makes a deal with God to safe mankind and the witch to safe his family. And there does not have to be a crash between the witch and God. Looking at her home we see that she is quite religious. She might be called a witch but she is more of a holy fool. Otto, the post man is another and Alexander turns into the third one in the end of the film, creating a holy trinity of holy fools in the film.Then there is the whole question of what really happens in the film. Is there a nuclear war, is there any deal with God, does he really go to the witch? What is reality, what is hallucinations and what are dreams? It is hard to say. We get hints, like turning off the music and so on but even they don't work. Tarkovsky deliberately makes it impossible to determine what is real and what is a dream. He said that he wanted it that way. People would have to make up their own mind about those things.I honestly think Tarkovsky would have been most pleased if we did not make up our mind. If we just lived in the mystery, the uncertainty, the dreamlike state of none logic. These things happen and they don't happen at the same time. We have to believe and not believe. Life is full of those moments. We don't know what would have happened if we acted differently, took a different path in life, even what happens at times in our life. Life is uncertainty and it is very modern to try to kill that. In fact this love of cold rationality is killing the world, creating atom bombs that can wipe out all life on earth.Tarkovsky's answer to this cold rational anti human spirit of modernity is mysticism, art and faith. This is crystallized brilliantly in the end when Alexander wakes up. It looks like God has answered his prayer or was it the witch? Or was it all a dream? He can't be sure and he can't find out. If God has moved time back to yesterday then no one but he remembers what will happen. The telephone calls hints at that. Alexander has only one possible action in front of him. To keep his promise, no matter if it was a dream or not, if God did something or not. Otherwise God might make all of it happen again and he is for sure not going to get another chance to stop the horror. So without knowing if this was a dream Alexander burns down his house and takes a vow of silence. In the beginning was the world, in the end is the silence. And here we come back to how personal this film was. Tarkovsky had in fact sacrificed his house and his life in the Soviet Unions for his art, and he honestly hoped that art and his sacrifice could change the world.This uncertainty is also reflected in the last shot of the tree. For a moment the dead tree looks alive. The hope here is in the next generation that waters this tree of life (I call it tree of life because Tarkovsky had previously shown us the tree of life in a painting, obviously to help us make the connection). Tree of life stands for hope eternal. It was one of the two trees in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve could not eat off. They are kicked out in fear that they will also eat of it (and become like God) and it is only promised to mankind at the end of time. In Christianity Jesus Christ is often seen as the tree of life. So what we get in the end is a hope for mankind in the from of a tree which stands for mysticism, art and faith - a hope kept alive with every new generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Final farewell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrei Tarkovsky's final film is the type of thing that fans of his cinema would immediately recognize as a great concept for him to take on: a man is celebrating his birthday with his family when it is interrupted by the news that the world is on the verge of war, and everything will be destroyed. In Hollywood-world there'd be explosions. In American independent cinema there would be survival at the edges of society as the characters are forced to live together in a very small house far from civilization and certainty. In Tarkovsky's view, it is another passionate reveal of faith, fate, and free will, and the father who sacrifices himself to save the world for his son (i.e., not too far from Tarkovsky's father, who went off to war and didn't come back, and with the same burning house as in the Mirror returning this time as part of the sacrifice).This movie has, I think, less cuts and longer takes than Tarkovsky's other movies, but it flows faster because of the more characters (Nostalghia is the only other movie of his I've seen that has quite so many people around, his world is only filled with people who represent something important, the background of populace does not concern him). They come in and out of frame, constantly shifting and moving, while the camera follows the most important information. Just keeping track of where the characters are spacially can take up the larger part of the playlength; following the dialog and its philosophical tones will more than keep you busy; and then basking in the painterly beauty of his landscapes and sepia tones ought to tie up the experience for the patient viewer just fine. As usual, this movie is only for those who desire contemplative cinema that takes its time and unravels rather than reveals. The impatient viewer might find himself looking at the timecode too often, and pity for that.Otherwise, for my part, nothing keeps my attention riveted more than his use of camera. The man can make that thing float through space as if it has no mass and has no weight, but is a figment of his will to compose imagery. The Sacrifice also features one of the finest performances by Erland Josephson I've ever seen, and honestly if I hadn't had known it was him going in I wouldn't have recognized him at all (he's a very different character from, for instance, the man from Saraband and Scenes from a Marriage). The dedication at the end is a punch in the gut, too, if you keep in mind that Tarkovsky never got to return to his homeland and died just after seeing this movie completed, effectively creating a zip effect from his own childhood to his son's, through the magic of this singular film.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarkovsky's last effort is hard to place, but gorgeous to look at.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film is in a tough spot - I'll either meet someone who holds it as one of their all time favourites, or I'll find someone who knows Andrei Tarkovsky inside out and sidelines it as one of his lesser efforts. Either way, it is worth watching. If all else fails and nothing grabs you at all, Sven Nykvist's cinematography is gorgeous. Arguably the best he's done. You could just drug yourself up and turn off the subtitles and smile for a few hours.This is why I don't love it: its visual similarities with Ingmar Bergman's films make the acting seem sub-par. It sounds really horrible, because Erland Josephson is one of my favourite actors and I admire Andrei Tarkovsky's earlier films. But Bergman has this special knack for getting out perfect performances, especially from women. When The Sacrifice's dramatic scenes flared I felt uncomfortable because I'm used to a stupidly high standard. My second and lesser reason has to do with the absence of grounding within the first hour of the film. Tarkovsky's philosophical musings on art and faith have always had a strong and fundamental world to exist it- Andrei Rublev has its medieval Russia, Stalker its post apocalyptic wasteland, The Mirror exists within the tendrils of memories. The Sacrifice doesn't give you a platform to make its ideas relevant, so the first time you watch the film it is distracting trying to find out actually where we are. Some praise this dreamy ambiguity. I disliked it. It's actually more enjoyable the second time around.The disappointing thing is, if Andrei Tarkovsky and Ingmar Bergman didn't exist, and this film was the first film made by some random director, it'd probably be an all time classic. But because it is at the end of two very rich and talented filmmakers' careers, it suffers in comparison.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit (if I may say so under IMDb guidelines), much as I admire his evident brilliance, I've always found it hard (going) to love Tarkovsky's work (except MIRROR). Yes there is much here of beauty - the elaborate sequence shots; the fluid recreation of interior space. But often Tarkovsky's rejection of purely intellectual cinema seems to leave a paganistic, cod-transcendent, touch-feely melange of muddled ideology, soggy spiritualism and cardboard characters. One can only marvel at a film, though, that switches from melancholy Chekhov 'comedy' to apocalyptic fantasy to supernatural horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarkovski's last movie is too human and a strong introduction to Bach.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this "OFFRET" at the time it came out for theaters. Back then, on my twenty-something, I was perhaps like most of the other young men regarding culture and entertainment. I did mostly enjoy Pop music, pop culture, some other light appeals for my free time. I had perhaps only one aspect making a difference: I liked movies beyond this popular approach. I could go and watch Chaplin, Buster Keaton, the mute movie pictures, the classics of John Ford or Anthony Mann, Hitchcock, and enjoy it all. It was perhaps this need of the diverse that guided me to go and see "OFFRET", the first TARKOVSKI movie I really saw. The story is there, strongly autobiographical, quite upsetting, but too human, too close to all humans experiences of some moments of desperation, also of hope and belief. It is perhaps the most human movie I ever saw. It is not spectacular, it is slow, repetitive and cruel on its silences. But it is a very moving piece of art. Seen at a proper time it can make damages on a sensitive soul, but, for I would say 30% of those who see it can be felt like a big prize, from its humanity. And then it comes BACH, and the small tune that starts and closes the movie picture. It is "ERBARME DICH", the 7 minutes aria from "MATTHÄUS PASSION", for me the one choral piece of art of all history. That was really the one revelation that attached me to this "OFFRET" to all my live. Before "OFFRET" my knowledge of classical music was too small. After "OFFRET" I discovered how intense and bright can be BACH, and from BACH so many others big classical and romantic composers. I invite you all to try this experience of discovering at one time a very human and sensitive movie picture and the passion of BACH. For at least some of you it may be also a singular experience to remember, as it was for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sacrifice (1986) - An insane movie about an insane man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is beautifully filmed, in the style of I. Bergman. That is enough to make the critics rave about it.However, it is, as Shakespeare might say, sound and fury signifying nothing.An insane man becomes delusional and thinks that a nuclear WW III has started, but he can make things revert back to peacetime if he makes a sacrifice.Actually if we all would kill ourselves there would be no more war. One person's sacrifice is not enough to assuage the gods, however.If you like nonsensical films, like "Tree of Life" or "Holy Motors", you might like this one.Too bad a beautiful production was wasted on this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all - this is my first comment on IMDb. What made me write it - an explosive realization that came to my mind when re-watching "The Sacrifice" for the 3 time. "The Sacrifice" is not a movie. It is a testament, a confession, a premonition, a warning, and as such - an action. The dying genius, as this is the last Tarkovsky's film, gets out of the screen and penetrates our minds to influence the actions we - his spectators - will take. "Here the actor is, himself, his own creation, his own work of art." we hear before Alexander parts to Maria's house. The authentic meaning of this, which in the English translation can be attributed to reflections about the art, all of a sudden flashes out in the Russian version - from this point on the author makes his own final decision not to remain a mere artist, but to act, to become a creator of the future.So what is Tarkovsky's intention, what does he see that compels him to take upon that responsibility? Through a sequence of beautifully shot scenes he rubs the painful truth into our faces - the course the humanity has taken so far leads us to an imminent destruction, a theme that according to his own diaries was haunting him during the last years of his life.And though there might be hope as Tarkovsky presents it, it is up to us to find the genuine answer. The ending stands in many ways open and ambiguous - Tarkovsky dedicated "The Sacrifice" to his own son he had left upon emigration in the USSR - his home country to the downfall of which he very much contributed.

		<shortDescription>With The Sacrifice, Tarkovsky's film career ends on a high</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not quite his best film(Andrei Rublev), The Sacrifice, like every film Andrei Tarkovsky did, still manages to be a wonderful film. Like other Tarkovsky films, particularly Solaris, it requires a lot of patience- like Solaris The Sacrifice has a rather ponderous and static first 30 minutes that might alienate viewers- but if stuck with it is very rewarding.Tarkovsky's films are some of the most visually accomplished and beautiful films ever seen, and The Sacrifice certainly is visually accomplished and beautiful with positively dream-like photography, evocative scenery that reflects the horror of nuclear war brilliantly and stirring images and symbolism that are not too hard to understand. That's unsurprising though considering it's from Sven Nykvist, an Ingmar Bergman regular and one of the greatest cinematographers who ever lived. Tarkovsky's direction, which always had a rare consistency in quality(to me he never made a bad film- one of the few directors for that to be the case- even my least favourite Ivan's Childhood is great as well as his most accessible), is as usual exemplary. There is a vast Bergman influence here in terms of themes, but there is enough of Tarkovsky's style to still make it feel still like a Tarkovsky film.The music is haunting and melancholic, like with Mirror Bach has never been more effectively used on film, and the script evokes a lot of thought and succeeds in giving dimension to the characters. The story is more rigid and uncomprisingly detached than Tarkovsky's other films, but while the film is deliberately slow and long there still is a lot of power and emotional impact, especially in the truly miraculous scene with the witch and the powerful epilogue. The acting suits the film very well indeed with Bergman regular Erland Josephsen giving a compelling performance in the multi-faceted lead role. Overall, not his best film, for me it ranks around the middle of his filmography, but Tarkovsky's final film(he probably would have done more films had he not died so young) hits a high note. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the dawn of World War III, a man searches for a way to restore peace to the world and finds he must give something in return. Alexander, a journalist and former actor and philosopher, tells his little son how worried he is about the lack of spirituality of modern mankind. In the night of his birthday, the third world war breaks out. In his despair Alexander turns himself in a prayer to God, offering him everything to have the war not happen at all. Roger Ebert wrote: ""The Sacrifice" is not the sort of movie most people will choose to see, but those with the imagination to risk it may find it rewarding. Everything depends on the ability to empathize with the man in the movie, and Tarkovsky refuses to reach out with narrative tricks in order to involve us. Some movies work their magic in the minds of the audience; this one stays resolutely on the screen, going about its urgent business and leaving us free to participate only if we want to." The question of liking or disliking this film is unimportant. Undoubtedly there will be people who will dislike it. But the one thing that is indeed impossible, is to remain indifferent to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tarkovsky's high-concept parable, his last film, may seem like extreme Bergman at first?some of the same actors and crew, including Erland Josephson and Sven Nykvist, same rugged northern coastline, a plot line that had been explored before (more or less) in Bergman's "Shame." And of course, Tarkovsky makes pretty extreme demands on the viewer; you have to endure an hour or so of gaseous philosophizing and world-weary epigrams before things really start happening. Until then, the only relief is supplied by a witchy Icelandic kitchenmaid (Gu?rún Gísladóttir!) and an eccentric mailman who tells a spooky anecdote, plus lingering shots of the gorgeous set. Try not to doze off (like I did for a bit) or press the Stop button before Tarkovsky has a chance to display his full powers as a director and visual artist. Hint: there's an ominous announcement on the radio (a JVC tuner in what looks like an antique walnut cabinet) and the lights go out; as soon as Erland sets off on his wobbly bicycle ride, you're pretty much out of the woods (figuratively speaking?there's only one highly symbolic tree in sight). The haunting final scenes and the epilogue are justly celebrated, though I'll leave the mystical meaning of all this to others. I'd give four stars, at best, to the first hour or so, ten stars to the rest. Cinephiles may want to watch on DVD; the color on the streaming video on Amazon seemed a little washed out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Existential parable with a vast spectrum of interpretations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarkovsky movies aren't among the easiest films to appreciate instantly. Some argue they feel drawn-out, feature a very typical, hard to decipher imagery, a somewhat detached language, create all in all very inaccessible worlds, at least on first glance. In a way, yes, but once you get in you'll find that they always deal with essential issues of life and faith, grow on you and offer to explore new perspectives on repeated viewings, eventually leave a lasting impression. Take "Offret" ("The Sacrifice") for example.Not only was the movie shot in Sweden, but Tarkovsky also clearly channels Bergman in this one, even uses parts of his crew, which plays well into the themes at stake. But he more than re-hashes "Wild Strawberries", "The Seventh Seal" or similar Bergman works that deal with death or re-evaluation of one's life. At any rate it's Tarkovsky's last movie and in many ways autobiographical and personal. It is a deep character study and deals with the reflections of an intellectual on his past life, which becomes unhinged at some point - and the changed circumstances demand a final, definite answer. The film is carefully constructed and leads from seemingly casual conversations of a life that is in complete order to something rather different. However, while the path that leads to the conclusion might be there right in front of you on screen, it's up to the viewer to decide where to draw the line between reality, imagination or dream. The viewer also has it in hand to determine the ultimate reasons why certain things happen: whether an atheist has suddenly become pious in the face of death and God answers, or innermost convictions have surfaced, even if witchcraft is in play or the wheel of life itself just turns once more thanks to the Nietzschean eternal recurrence, a theory a certain postman ascribes to. The spectrum of Tarkovsky's "Sacrifice" is enormous and the picture is as substantial as the viewer is willing to concede.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tarkovsky is one of my favorite directors, i've been enchanted by Stalker, Solyaris, Zerkalo and Nostalghia. Tarkovsky captures beauty in his own style, always with a magnificent cinematography and bold creativity. He is truly a master and his movies a lesson to his followers. Offret is no different, everything is there like it's predecessors. I was delighted once again.Knowing of his own upcoming death, Tarkovsky turns to religion as never before. I am an extreme atheist, i can't tolerate religions. So this was a great disappointment for me. I didn't ever expect Tarkovsky to suddenly become a poor old man at the verge of his end. I found his early works to be spiritually richer than this movie. There is always some magic around his movies. Offret ruins all that magic, forces you into an expressionist Christian world and then it ends. Surely some will say i didn't get the movie, others that i have to see it again maybe when i'm older. But no. If you're a friend of Nietzsche than keep your distance from Offret's meanings and enjoy the ride on this beautifully directed movie.Still i can't give it any less than an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tarkovsky last film is still what we can expect given his previous films. This one, though, is darker in tone, certainly related to the fact that the director was dying of cancer while filming his last film. Tarkovsky is perhaps the greatest art film director who ever lived and it shows on all his films.Like The Mirror and Nostalghia, this film has gorgeous cinematography and it is worthy of watching only for the images. It is essentially plot less, though I have watched only once and thus I failed to absorb everything in this complex work of art.Given the impression it made on first watching I would rate it as inferior to Nostalghia, Andrei Rublev and the Mirror and roughly equivalent to Solaris. Still, it is great and rises above 99% of all films. Highly recommended for everyone who has the patience and the open mind to watch art films and I note that I am not the single biggest fan of art films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow pace allows time to immerse yourself in philosophical thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exiled from his native Russia, Andrei Tarkovsky shot his final film, The Sacrifice, on Faro Island, where Ingmar Bergman produced his body of work (and also lived). Tarkovsky also used Bergman's cinematographer, Sven Nykvist. He was also aware that this would be his ultimate film, as he had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Unfortunately, whilst he survived till the release of the film, he died shortly afterwards, in the same year. The subject of his concluding piece is telling of his knowledge of his impending departure from the world, and it is fitting and profound, as you might expect from the Russian master of the poetic, and aesthetic.Alexander (played by Erland Josephson - a Bergman regular, who also worked on Tarkovsky's 1983 Nostalgia), has a birthday, where some family and close island friend, Otto (Allan Edwall), come to offer their congratulations. They here on a statically-interrupted television broadcast. that a nuclear strike is imminent. With this news the family break down emotionally, and Alexander pleads to God to alter this reality, and offers himself in sacrifice to the ones he loves. This offering is seen to its fundamental conclusion when he wakes (possibly from a dream), and all is as it was, the threat of World War III seemingly never a subject of genuine certainty. Towards the climax of this film, is a one-shot take lasting several minutes, whose logistics are incredible, but Tarkovsky still manages to infuse the scene with some kind of mystical power, that I believe permeates all of his films.As you would expect from a Tarkovsky film, the pace is slow (which gives the audience time to immerse themselves within the intricacies of philosophical thought, and the profound nature of the situation). But with this comes a flurry of beautiful imagery. The muted colours reflect the setting, with its cold, and subdued backdrop. And what is it that we do when we face death - a difficult moment to comprehend? We perhaps reflect on our achievements, and speak to our friends and family. And perhaps when we die, our spirit lives on in others, or new beings. Or maybe we simply continue in the minds and spirits of our offspring, passing on knowledge, character, and morality.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

I also found Susan Fleetwood's crying fit unconvincing and I found her erotic dishevelment embarrassingly contrived.

		<fullReview>This film was actually curriculum where I studied once. This is six years ago, yet the film made enough of a lasting impression to make me dear to write about it now. I was too young to really enjoy it - or grasp it, if you will, and I must admit, parts of it seemed like a terrible drag, all tough other parts were very interesting and oozing of some sort of eerie repression, or maybe horror. The film is very demanding, and sets you back into wondering what, why and how a lot of the time. Tarkovsky, it seems, isn't about to give anything to the spectators for free on the intellectual level, and I guess many are simply put off by this. The simplest example to this might be what other commentators has perceived as a World War III scenario, but in fact there are no clear references to any war at all in this film (to my memory). There aren't any scenes of combat, and no war machinery is ever shown (for sure). What is it then, but that of a feeling conveyed? This is of course very important to the understanding of the film's underlying topic.Slow paced, difficult to understand, and confusing it may be at times, however I think it's worth the endurance, if only to experience something different, and a lot more thought provoking than the average Hollywood entertainment film. Further more, Tarkovsky's skills with film techniques are very evident and this film is, if nothing else, a good film to spot the successful use of film language on a very high and subtle level ? the way he so dynamically and dramatically uses lighting, and the way he chooses to use sound, like in the opening sequence where the dialogue of characters far away in the picture is unnaturally audible across a vast meadow. And not least the way he so subtly can convey feelings and moods with simple, but effective means ? maybe even tricking us to make connotations to some sort of nuclear holocaust. Or is it a nuclear holocaust at all?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*some spoilers are included* After I've watched this for the first time, I was confused and not very happy. I liked the movie, but I expected it to be a total sacrifice movie because I was enchanted by Lars Von Trier movies and his work which is pretty cruel in my opinion ( and that's why I adore him) and then this movie gave me some kind of easy, light, kinda sleepy heavenly feel. It slowly introduced me to the world of the eternal beauty of nature, subtle philosophy teachings and the kindness of Alexander (I loved his personality all the time). It is not perfect because of the sacrifice itself, but of the glorious images which are also some very strong symbols. I adored the fire, it really touched me and I thought of some philosophy statements about the fire itself. If you want a total sacrifice I recommend "Breaking The Waves" (Lars Von Trier), but if you want an art treasure and nature yelling at your face, this is the great movie. I gave it 9/10 because the plot was little weak, maybe that is why I love this? I don't know, but this movie will have its hands on my mind for a long, long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This turned out to be Andrei Tarkovsky's last film. Like it is almost always the case with his work, this too is about faith. Alexander, the protagonist worries about society and its lack of spirituality. The opening scene has him plant a tree with his young son. The last scene has the son, the only one not involved in the chaos everyone is, rest under it.Sacrifice is the closest Tarkovsky and Bergman came to making a film together. Sven Nykvist, the cinematographer, Erland Josephson as Alexander and Allen Edwall as Otto the postman were all longtime collaborators with the great Swedish director and Tarkovsky was apparently in awe of Bergman and his films. Through Nykvist and his magical control of light and the slow, meticulous, long shots set to Bach, Tarkovsky makes a work of extraordinary beauty. The story (or so) is about Alexander saving the world from a fatal war by making a string of personal sacrifices. We don't know how much of this is just his dream. Black and white shots are interspersed with shots of desaturated colour, the timeline is non-linear and it is possible that everything that happens is indeed a long dream. There is perhaps value in analysing the film as a study, but I am loath to do that. My experiences with such films have always been about curiosity. The questions this curiosity asks is mainly the "how did they do it" variety than the "what does he mean" kind. For instance, there is an early scene with Adelaide, Alexander's difficult wife and Maria, the housemaid who could also be a witch. Maria asks the lady if she can leave for the day. The scene is set in such a way that Adelaide paces left and right, while also getting closer to the camera with each turn. Maria is placed bang in the middle of the frame and her eyes follow Adelaide's pacing. At the end of it all, Adelaide ends up walking behind the line of the camera while Maria is staring at it. This is the sort of thing which elevates a film to a different plane. There is the story, the acting and the music yes, but this is something unequivocally cinema. The camera, the actors and their respective movements. In another scene, Alexander is shot as a reflection of a painting by Leonardo da Vinci (Adoration of the Three Kings). Apparently, Tarkovsky felt this would appear as if he was part of the painting and now he has come out of it. What a thought!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is difficult to watch a Tarkovskij film if you are already tired (having his films only in subtitled editions doesn't help), I actually fell asleep during this at a certain point in the film, had to take a pause, and continue when I got back awake. I also liked other Tarkovskij films better, like Andrej Rubljev or Stalker, but still liked this a lot.Nonetheless, Offret is really a good film, both from a cinematographical point of view, both from the story and the storytelling point of view. It's one of those Russian films where not much happens during the story, some of the scenes might seem awkward to a modern- day audience, but you still feel blown away. This and Nostalghia actually required me to check a few analises to understand better the story. They're way more hermetic than other Tarkovskij films, but no less good. I particularly loved the choice for the setting and the music (Despite it didn't show up much in the film). Anyhow, I suggest to watch Offret twice, and to read a good analisis of the thematics in the film before the second view. It helps a lot in understanding the story, the reason of certain things, and to appreciate better the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The final and my final Andrei Tarkovsky film solidifies him in my top 10 directors of all-time list. The Sacrifice feels like a tour of everything Tarkovsky, though putting itself in the ideal middle ground as to explore them all. It features science-fiction, philosophy, mortality, male- female relationships, parent-child relationships, religion, magic, long shots, rich plots, nature and wide static angles. The imagery is a particular strong point, with his always incredible cinematography, as the colour is drained from the film during the World War III sequences and brought back subsequently. It has a very delicate and patient approach, but allows itself to explode with surprises without feeling contrived.Much of the dialogue elaborates anecdotal metaphors to the crumbling of life which represent the outer view of the world and are often fascinating. My only issues are the overacting of Susan Fleetwood (who is, interestingly enough, the younger sister to Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac, one of my favourite bands, odd that a British person should star in a Tarkovsky film) and it's sometimes too mythological rather than spiritual, with Maria being explained as being a witch rather than having it ambiguous or up for interpretation. I imagine this will be a film that will fascinate me more in rewatches, but I already adore the idea of the premise.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarkovsky's last movie. Self realization and transformation of an atheist philosopher.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergei Tarkovsky has an unique cinematic diction: fragmented, complicated, anachronistic, with lengthy shots taken from static positions, long soliloquy, static frames with close resemblance of theatrical stage than a movie. He reminded me of Ingmar Bergman time and again while watching his movie ' Sacrifice', his last directional flick. Perhaps because the locale was Sweden, and the theatrical setting was reminiscent of Autumn Sonata: similar guilt complex, confessional monologues, predominant gloomy shades in shot compositions. The cinematic language is pretty dense, with layered allusions, switching between real and imaginary sequences. The movie starts with the Leonardo Da Vinci's painting Adoration of Magi used as a backdrop, on which the credit rolls, and then the camera pans along the tree stem of the palm tree to mix with the reflection of real foliages. As in Christian concept, the palm tree represents triumph over death and disaster, the movie unfolds the deadly tension of impending Nuclear Holocaust, and a barren tree planted by Alexandar symbolizes the mankind's hope for the triumph over the impending doom. Alexandar, in awe of this utter destruction, promises to sacrifice all his dearest possessions to the God. This is Tarkovsky's depiction of the inner self, truths hidden in apparently routine and mundane activities, expressed through a confessional narrative and studded with visions of the protagonist Alexandar. The visions may be mistaken as dreams, at least there are ample equivocal suggestions. But essentially the strong sense of impending doom, a nuclear holocaust, the fear for the posterity goaded the film maker...when an atheist prays for God's benevolence and eventually sacrifices his dearest mortal possessions to save the world.</fullReview>

Moreover, the pace is not an abstract immutable entity, extrinsic to the content that has to be delivered; nor is that content a mere pretext for formalistic, mannerist exercises.

		<shortDescription>Breathtaking colours and interesting 'double'-story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As always when Tarkovsky makes films the pictures are absolutely breathtaking - in particular, I feel, in this movie where colours used often are subdued and even sometimes simply appears like on a 'scale of grey'. Take note of those scenes!Furthermore the story itself is an interesting 'double'-story (as in most of his films) where the 'objective' story runs along parallel lines to the 'subjective' experience/development of the main character: in this film a man goes increasingly insane while the world around him likewise is falling apart as a (maybe THE) war commences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tarkovsky's final film has a very contemplative, sedate tone; the characters are liable to open philosophical discussions or talk about their memories from the dim, dim past at the oddest moments. The "plot" is very vague and, despite the terrifying premise of a nuclear holocaust, there is almost no urgency. Where the film excels is in its camerawork: the movements of the camera are so fluid and so "soft", that you'll often get from a very long shot to a close-up of a person without even noticing it. Some people have called it a masterpiece; such an opinion is understandable, even if I don't agree with it. (**1/2)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb cinematography, but overly heavy-handed direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie for the first time on big screen. Immediately I knew that this movie was going to pontificate on some metaphysical ideas, perhaps through "evocative" imagery, uncompromising frames, desolate mise-en-scene, or whatever means these overly serious seers employ to tell us about the world. I give due respect and accolades for the cinematographer, Sven Nykvist who also shot the wonderful "Tenant" by Polanski. This is a color film shot as if it is B&amp;W. This signature style was previewed in "Tenant." His low key lighting is the only thing that saves this film from its drowning in self-importance. Here are my biggest objections to this movie. I thought the use of monologue ( more like a soliloquoy in a theater piece) to convey Alexander's thoughts was so pitifully unimaginative. It is always better to show it than using a voice over, however voice over is a far more desirable option that the kinds of monologues I saw in this movie. If you listen carefully to what he's saying, they are inner monologues that should not have been verbalized. There is nothing more uncomfortable than some self important person telling me that there is not any truth in the world, or that we must overcome the fear of death, gee I didn't know that! They often border on cliches rather than insight. Does this director understand subtext? subtlety?In addition, I couldn't forget the fact that I was watching a Tarkovsky film. The actors moved about like chess pieces, no, they were more like arranged by the director. Two people standing in the foreground, facing away from each other, and the third enters the frame in the background, and poses in the space between them. Of course,all of them look ridiculously serious. This kind of overly calculated blocking and frames repeat throughout the whole film. The acting and blocking should organically fit into the vision of the director, and contribute to the seamless storytelling. However, this film baits for awes of the audience rather than telling its story; "what a beautiful shot! what beautiful framing!" I wish I was allowed to immerse myself in the story and experience the journey with the characters. I feel remorse at having said such harsh words about this director who is not without talent or some measure of greatness. Also learning that this was his last movie, and that he made this while in exile make me want to see the movie differently. However I believe a film should stand on its own. Some may like this movie passionately, but this is not my cup of tea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many things have and will be said about this movie. Regardless of the easy critics: it's boring, there's no action, it's self-indulging, etc.., I would only add this. There will always be 2 kinds of people (whether they are film-goers, tourists, readers..): the ones who like to "recognize" things (the same stories being told, who is the hero, who is the villain? the same places to go to, the same food...) and the ones who like act up in a retarded fashion in public. As to the film, why don't you try it? How many films have you seen that take your hand and take you to a place you've been to before? On the contrary how often do you understand everything from the very first minutes of a movie? who is going to marry who, who is the bad guy, who's going to betray, will there be a happy end? Aren't you ever fed up with this? Try and see The Sacrifice. It's about boredom as excitement. It's about seeing the world through drowsy eyes. It's a very Russian story, and what it's like to be torn between religion, ideals and the lust for success and power and money. It's about betrayal by the people you trust. It's about love.You may not like it but at least you'll have tried. Be curious! Stop being cinematographically correct. Go outside and scream at your neighbours in frustration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"sacrifice" of 2 1/2 hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is extreme cynicism-- even solipsism-- to imagine that the world exists in one's own mind. Yet, in some sense, each of us lives in a universe bounded by his own five senses and ruled over by "the Mind." In a post-nuclear-holocaust world, Alexander faces a reality that he cannot bear. In essence, he sacrifices himself by visiting the witch Maria, and one may almost regard that meeting as more symbolic than literal. Somehow, Alexander decides that by giving up everything (i.e., his home, his family, his sanity), he can save the world. He can undo the "war" simply by making it a part of his madness. In other words... if, ultimately, he is deemed crazy, the destruction will be passed off as the mere "ravings of a madman". Where normally society determines, in retrospect, what is "sane" and "insane," Alexander is given the chance to rewrite history by choosing his insanity. The question then becomes: Is he losing his grip from the start (and indeed off the deep end by the film's end) or is his "madness" consciously chosen? In that sense alone, Alexander is a sort of Hamlet; he's "crazy like a fox." We're never quite sure whether he is in control of himself or not, but the net result-- if we accept the ending literally-- is that the world goes on without him.I have a feeling that this film was Tarkovsky's way of dealing with his declining health. The watering of the dead tree is symbolic, at least to me, of the way in which one continues to do the simple, quotidian things even in the face of death (in the hope that, either within one's lifetime or not, it will yield something beautiful for others.) His birthday also marks the death of civilization and, in choosing madness (the death of the rational mind), Alexander gives life back to the world. I'm quite sure that Tarkovsky felt that, in accepting his death in this project, he was making a statement about what it meant to be alive and, obversely, how precious and fragile human life ultimately is. I also get the "Just a Gigolo" theme here: "Life goes on without me." He's comforting himself in the thought that, in sacrificing his life to his art, even in death his life will have had meaning... in the hearts and minds of the people he has touched. Alexander's visiting the witch, in some way, represents that moment in a person's life when he chooses conversion... when he decides to accept the supernatural, in fitting with Pascal's wager (i.e., risking all on the only bet that can possibly lead to salvation... be it a bet on God, or a "higher power", or Destiny, or "other"...)I'm not sure that Tarkovsky would agree with much of this. He had a tendency to depersonalize... perhaps in the tradition of a Vertov or an Eisenstein (at least in the sense of letting the "camera eye" capture reality)... in an effort to create a universal art. But perhaps "Offret", to its credit, achieves universality... describing the kind of spiritual legacy that artists, as nearly all people, endeavor to leave behind. While it may not be quite as clearly defined as Whitman's "Leaves of Grass", in which the poet literally contemplates the way in which his mind and body give back to the Earth, it's in that same general vein. What makes "Offret" unsatisfying to me is it's adagio pace, the histrionics of actors who thought that they were performing on stage and the great Sven Nykvist's wooden cinematography (which worked well for Bergman by fails utterly here.) It's a two-and-a-half hour film, of which one-and-a-half hours are a yawn (and of that "yawn"... at least a half hour in the middle is pure snooze.) It's still Tarkovsky, so I recommend it to other cinephiles, but its far from the kind of final masterpiece one might expect having seen "Andrei Rublyov", "Solaris", "Zerkalo", "Stalker" and "Nostalghia".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't work for me . . . pretentious beyond compare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the exalted praise this film gets from other viewers, it seems clear to me that I either simply didn't understand the movie, or I simply have different tastes in movies than the other people who have reviewed this film.The biggest reason why this film even gets a "3" for me was the cinematography, which was sweeping and beautiful and not the least bit afraid of absolute concentration. It's so pleasantly different from the rapid jump-cut editing of today's blockbusters here in the United States, and I was glad to look at a tree or a picture longer than most modern movies would allow.**SPOILER ALERT** My main fault with this movie is the screenplay. It's a contrived mess. The hero, Alexander, just happens to be taking stock in his life and where his life has led him when nuclear war breaks out, and the postman who's read more books and has more whimsy than your local hippie librarian just so happens to know a lonely witch who can undo all that has been done in return for a "favor"? It strains credibility to an absolute fault, and the plot line sounds like the work of a child just beginning to write in cursive.Then there are the situations and characters that take you absolutely nowhere. Alexander's wife -- what purpose did she serve other than being the obligatory hysteric in a crisis film? And her rambling about loving one man and marrying another? Where does this train of thought go? Nowhere!!!! Do we see her analyze her marriage and seek to do anything about her plight? NO!!! It's a line that makes no sense in the film and has no resolution at all, and yet ENTIRE FILMS have been made about that very feeling! There are so many lines that don't make sense in light of everything going on, and it just feels contrived and meandering.I understand there might be a cultural difference in storytelling that's at work here. Perhaps I like more concise storytelling and much less contrived plot lines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky's final 1986 film, The Sacrifice (Offret Sacrificatio), is an exercise in cinema appreciation; not because it is a great film, but because it has great moments and moments of sheer monotonous boredom. It is one of those rare films that goes to the antipodes of what is good and bad in that art form. Overall, it's a film worth seeing, but it is in no way, shape, nor form a great film; much less a masterpiece. Tarkovsky, who had fled the Soviet Union, filmed The Sacrifice in Sweden, using Swedish actors- including Erland Josephson, the star of many Ingmar Bergman films, and used Bergman's longtime cinematographer Sven Nykvist, as well. This was a wise choice, as The Sacrifice is one of the more arresting visual works anyone is likely to see on screen, especially in its interesting choice of medium shots as the dominant frame, or mis-en-scene. Yet, where the film falters is by, instead of maximizing the positive traits of Tarkovsky and the Bergman contingent, the film brought out the worst elements of Tarkovsky and Bergman. As example, Tarkovsky wrote the screenplay, and like most Tarkovsky films, The Sacrifice is long (142 minutes on the Kino DVD), but it lacks all of the subtle poesy in earlier Tarkovsky films (Solaris, Stalker) and instead indulges on overwrought scenes of terror and regret. There are early scenes where philosophic banter occurs, but the last three quarters of the film is filled with some astonishingly bad acting, which has to be laid at the feet of Tarkovsky. Bergman, who was possibly the greatest screenwriter of the Twentieth Century, was always concise in his screenplays. However, whereas that strength of Bergman is ignored, Bergman's greatest weakness is employed, and that is a relentlessly depressing view of life and the characters. One knows from the beginning that they are all doomed, and, save for the youngest character in the film, this comes to fruition, although, this is only so if one renders the most positive interpretation of the film possible. In all other ways, that ending is likely a delusion, which means Bergmanian dourness combines with a dearth of Tarkovskian poesy to make the film dark, despairing, and oftentimes dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was the sacrifice?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man makes a pact with God or something that please don't kill my family, I'll burn my house down in exchange.I'd be confused if I was a divine being. ("Why?") Either that or he'll sacrifice himself in order to avoid the fear of everyone dying. Sounds selfish AND stupid.I think I agree that the witch bit was an uncomfortable fit. She probably isn't a witch anyway, as she tries to tell him. (I think she slept with him out of pity, not with magic in mind.) So, again, he's a bit silly. And apparently immoral as well. I thought witches were anti-Christian, and his appeals to a Christian divine being suggest he cares, which makes him immoral.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hélas, an overstretched film. It has the double-barrelled attention to the beauty of shot that one would expect from Tarkovsky using Sven Nykvist, Bergman's DoP of choice. Yet the film, which is characteristically slow and unblinking doesn't have a coherent plan with which to fill up the bedrock cracks in the narrative that its ponderousness achieves.Instead we are left with morsels of might-have-been: the infamous penultimate sequence, so beautifully shot but so cinematographically confused; the isolated, breathing room in which the boy sleeps; the point of this particular choice of Bach/Leonardo da Vinci. The acting's rather good. Susan Fleetwood's hysteria at the announcement of impending holocaust is sustained, unique and horrendous. 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS IS IT!!!! When people talk about pretentious and boring films that sophisticated people fawn over, this is the best example I can think of apart from a few films by Jean-Luc Godard! While some unfairly look at Ingmar Bergman's films as being pretentious (they've been made fun of repeatedly on TV and in short like De Düva), I have seen a huge number of them and they are not pretentious. While they aren't always as great as some claim (and this is true of any film maker), but it is clear he is a great writer and director. However, this horrible film that is a joint Swedish-Russian production IS pretentious, boring and just about as much fun as eating broken glass. No,...wait,...I think I'd rather eat broken glass than watch this film again. Now I am NOT saying movies need to be fun to be watched and appreciated--it's just that if they are depressing and bizarre there should be some reason for subjecting the viewer to this.The movie delights in long and emotionally disconnected camera work. Some may see this as artistic, but I just see it as dull and lifeless. Then, when it is combined with interminably long and self-exploratory monologues, it is a recipe for total boredom. The characters rarely interact--they talk at each other or just talk into space. And the surrealistic elements of the film may seem sophisticated to some, but to me they are a giant headache. For a similar effect, read several books by Albert Camus, a couple existential philosophers and then rap yourself in the head with a mallet.If you like this film--great. I am very happy for you. But you also should realize for the average viewer (and in fact, MOST viewers), this film will be a tedious experience. In other words, this movie definitely is for a very, very selective audience.FYI--This is the third film I have seen directed by the widely acclaimed Russian director, Andrei Tarkovsky. While many love his films, I have found all three overly long, overly introspective and overly "artsy". He just isn't my taste, though if you have a very high tolerance for these sort of films, you may love them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a masterpiece at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed when I saw Offret the first time years ago. I wanted to check what time did to the film and to me, and so I rented the new DVD. Alas, the experience repeated itself. I was irritated by the slowness of both the camera and actors to the point that I watched almost the whole film on double speed (which I recommend to everyone; subtitles make sure you will follow the plot in the absence of sound). Tarkovskij is still my favorite director, I just wish he did not make this silly movie with pretentions all over. First, the plot. I learned from the documentary "Directed by Andrei Tarkovskij", included on the DVD, that the plot was concocted by putting two separate original screenplays together: one about the witch and another about the final war. With this knowledge it is easier to understand the resulting absurdity of the plot. Second, the characters' psychology. Well, there is none, but perhaps it was meant to be that way. Tarkovskij is not about psychology, he is after something else and much grander. His characters only are wooden puppets, moving on the set in somnambulic stupor to illustrate or convey the author's message, whatever it may have been. The director's dictatorial style is well shown in the mentioned documentary: he apparently seldom gave the actors freedom to enliven their performances with even small gestures. Third, visuals. Not impressive at all. The empty, bleak landscape was not exciting, although again - it was probably meant to be that way. Camera moved a lot, but slowly. There were no revealing angles or shots, with the exception of the dream sequences. In the documentary we most often saw the master cameraman Sven Nyquist standing along, while the director was sitting behind the camera... So what is all this about? Since I have been "trained" by the previous Tarkovskij's films, I guess, this film is, again, about an individual's responsibility for the state of the world. But in contrast with the early masterpieces Ivan's Childhood and Andrei Rublev, the message of active involvement is muddled here by imposition of too literal a threat of the world annihilation and the unforgivable introduction of the witch theme, which is - apart from other things - incongruent with Tarkovskij's religiosity. I am sorry that the director was carried away too far in his crusade against any kind of rationalism in the world of human affairs.</fullReview>

Artistic impulses.The message I got from this movie was that nuclear war is bad (Mr. Mackey from South Park, anyone?). Great but ultra-trivial.Entertainment amounted to zero.Artistic impulses were absent unless boring people is considered a form of art.No other movie I have ever seen was more of a waste of time.From the information on this site I gather that the production of this movie was dogged on several levels, so I will keep an open mind for Tarkovsky's other movies. Even great directors are entitled to failures.This is the only movie that I have ever given a 1/10 to so far.</fullReview>
