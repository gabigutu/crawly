		<shortDescription>You will be ashamed of your humanity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Earthlings exposes the atrocities committed against animals, that if viewed in human terms would amount to the most evil crimes against humanity, and should (I hope someday will) be considered as such. It is an important and informative film, fueled by horrific images captured through an unflinching camera lens.Go into this expecting to be overwhelmed by what you are going to see. I have seen images from the holocaust and the rape of Nangjing and read stories of torture from WW2 and these are frighteningly similar. Much to my surprise it is never preachy - nor does it need to be. The nightmarish images, which to my mind resemble a reasonable facsimile of Hell itself, with the innocent being tortured by their evil overlords, are more than enough. Evil is not the only word that comes to mind when you hear what the workers and trainers say to their sorry subjects as they inflict their torture. But I do not hate the evil men, I somehow pity them, both for the lives they lead and their loss of something I deeply value - empathy and compassion.What makes Earthlings so powerfully convincing is actually quite simple if you believe that inflicting pain and suffering on an innocent living being is wrong. This kind of suffering could be the result of something as simple as not spaying/neutering your pet. Unfortunately as history shows us, we have a lot to learn about how to treat each other, let alone the animals that share our world. Earthlings gives voice to those that are powerless and cannot speak out on their own behalf.The film makes a strong argument for some form of compromise on the meat eater/vegetarian debate, but it also delves into the issue of fur trading, animals as a form of entertainment (ie zoos), and as test subjects in the name of science. The footage in each segment is nothing short of incredible and is surely the result of years of effort, on the shoulders of many impassioned individuals, in order to be collected. To those who contributed to this effort, I salute you.Its true that Earthlings does not offer solutions to all of the problems it seeks to expose. Nor could it hope to do so. The viewer is challenged to seek their own answers and carry the voice of the voiceless to the lawmakers. I can only hope that more people see this and make changes in how they live their lives, and the laws that govern the treatment of animals. The devastating reality is that this potentially life-changing documentary contains only a microscopic portion of what is happening every single day, in every single country, around the world. This is a must see and should be required viewing in high school classrooms. In case you decide not to watch Earthlings, particularly if it is because you believe animals are ignorant and don't deserve to be treated humanely, I want you to know that ignorance is NOT bliss if you walk on four legs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi all, I'm a 20 yr old Sydney boy who was asked by a mate to watch this film. I've read some of your comments. Here is my response: I, like some of you have stated, also have a strong stomach when it comes to watching "goresome" and violent eruptions of human behaviour. Nazi-ism to animals doesn't even come close to interpreting the horrors portrayed in this film. The fundamental objective of this movie was not to sicken you and "turn you off" meat in terms of food, science, fashion or entertainment. It was to simply inform you, not only of the daily mistreating of animals on a worldwide scale, but as how humanity perceives other beings that live on this planet, and how we perceive ourselves. I am a vegetarian living in Australia (was born in India where the majority of people are vegetarians &amp; cows are sacred). Being a vegetarian in a western culture is difficult enough it is, supplementing for foods without meats (even some simple veggie burgers would have beef or some sort of meat substance in them). Also, I never had much faith in humanity especially in recent years with corrupt politics, terrorism, and general arrogant human behaviour. I could give you all a thesis on why and how humanity has failed in co-existing on a planet that us, one single species out of so many, has destroyed through what we consider "our evolution" (Pollution, waste, animal cruelty to name a few).When I saw scenes throughout this film, I was not only appalled by the graphical representation of mistreating of animals, but what upset me the most is that we, as humans, as earthlings, have no compassion or moral value whatsoever. People will state that animals are edible because of their religious scriptures, or that it will provide us with the required nutrients and supplements, or even that we DO have the right to kill an animal, as long as it is done in a civil, appropriate manner. Others will mention I am over-exaggerating, misunderstanding and being difficult with the issue. The truth is, if animals didn't exist... we would treat our fellow human beings the same way. We used humans for sport in the Colosseum in Greece. Cannibalism has arisen during times of survival or sacrifice. We bully each other during our youth, and don't realise the affects of this until we have come of age, and have suffered mental conditions from it. We believe in torture to other human beings, racism, Nazi-ism.This film is based around animal mistreating but branches off to so many other factors. I put the two things in my life first that the majority of humans in our modern world would put last, Morals and Compassion. I would rather have some sort of deficiency in my body (I may feel a little more tired than normal people, or not as strong) than to eat something that used to live, breathe and feel. Having a deficiency is a small price to pay than to kill an animal. I don't care if killing animals is done for religious, financial, social or even health purposes. Just like I would never kill another human being, I could never kill an animal. Not because of this film, not because of my beliefs, but because I feel obligated to.Fight for what you believe in with compassion, intelligence and strong moral ground! PS: Sorry if I misspell anything, I'm bloody exhausted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unquestionably the most comprehensive look at animal abuses and cruelty ever made. A very sobering look at why animal rights is something we must all recognize. Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful job narrating (he's a life-long vegan), and brings a solemn tone to the film. The video clips are hard to watch, but are undeniably happening millions of times every day, all over the world. With any luck, people will watch this film and be inspired to reject and prevent this kind of cruelty from occurring in the future. I know I will.I will give this film a 10, because even though I knew some of the information going into it, the film still covers more aspects of animal rights than I ever though imaginable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Electroshock to the Head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can totally understand how someone can have a lack of compassion for animals. By the end of this documentary I felt somewhat numb myself, from the ceaseless onslaught of horror contained within. So if you're brought up, for instance, in a hunting culture, or a biblical culture, or an "animal manufacturing" culture, or the outskirts of a bull-fighting ring, you're probably numb to the suffering of living things, too. What this movie sets out to do is climb into the minds of those who have lost perspective for whatever reason and remind them that if they're still mistreating animals, or participating in the mistreatment of animals, then they're not fulfilling a major responsibility of being human, and are therefore part human, semi-human, sub-human.Call me a softy, but I've felt for a long, long time that there's really no fundamental difference between humans and other animals. Therefore, animals experience things like pain, despair, horror and fear the same way we do. To me this just makes logical, common sense. But again, I can totally understand how someone can disagree. I, and the creators of this film, just ask those naysayers to remember, to look deep within ourselves, beyond their conditioning, that it is possible for humans to err when it comes to such belief systems. The Nazis are a good example - they treated Jews like animals. But honestly, the stuff in this documentary are the same - and far worse, in many cases - than what the Nazis did to the Jews. Nazis still had a relative modicum of respect and restraint for other humans compared to the way animals are treated by humans. If you disagree then you need to get a grip, and look at the images in this movie, and compare the number of Jews (in the millions) to the number of animals (in the billions). Let's be frank.The truth is this documentary is not going to change those who are like the people depicted in the movie who are completely blind to what they're really doing. Many humans are beyond hope in that respect. But it will change those who are straddling the fence. It will give them the knowledge they prayed would never interrupt their meals. It's not a message. It's a reality. A grim, horrific, and terribly sad reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An extremely disturbing film. I, like some other readers, felt physically ill and at one point stopped the movie - coming back to it a couple of days later.I'm sure we have all seen disturbing footage or heard gruesome stories, but what made this seem different was it was very well narrated and the content well structured. The sound track was wonderful but sombre with the likes of Moby and others of his ilk.An amazing movie... and a catalyst for all of us to consider what we can do to help the situation - no matter how small the contribution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People should be disgusted by this piece because it represents what is true in today's society and what is disgusting. If you cannot kill your own meat humanly, you should not be eating it. Lethargy and turning a blind eye hurts you just as much as anyone. This is the reason for heart disease and obesity being rampant in the USA. If you need to run and kill your own prey (and most often unsuccessful) to survive then meat is a calorie packed choice for your sustenance - if you graze and meander all day (like most couch potatoes and most in the US) than you should be eating a grazer's diet of veggies. Meat from suffering dirty animals is not necessary in a modern human's diet.And, I disagree with the otherwise eloquent poster below. I have never felt drained or tired from my diet - in fact I feel lean and energetic.... and guilt-free.In the end, there is every reason to watch this film. It is every persons obligation to know what exists in their own backyard and what they are contributing to. If you are fine with your actions after that - at least it is your informed choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At last the horrors of our animal industries are revealed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a brilliant piece of work from Shaun Monson and Joaquin Phoenix. Using undercover footage, the film shows what the animals go through to give us the products that the human race uses every day.The average Joe eats meat, but wouldn't kill an animal himself. He tries his best not to think about how it went from a living breathing pig or cow, to a rasher of bacon or a steak. Many people get through their whole lives protected from the horrible truth. As Phoenix said in the film "If slaughterhouses had glass walls, we would all be vegetarians." Well, this documentary shows what's going on behind those walls. This film is not just about animals used for the food industry, but also shines the light on - among others - the fur industry, animal circuses and animal experimentation. By avoiding overly emotive language the film has a tremendous impact and the biggest shame is that not more people have seen it - or even heard of it. Please watch this film, and tell others about it. It gives an incite into the things we take for granted.You don't have to buy it - it's free to watch on google.http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1282796533661048967Watch it all. Take an hour and a bit out of your life for this movie - it will change it. I have been vegan ever since watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary shows 'behind the scenes' of what goes on behind closed walls, when it comes to our use of animals. Right from the beginning, harsh realities are shown onto the screen. It is hard to watch this movie, without feeling sympathy for the creatures that are born to be exploited. The message in this movie is strong and insightful. I highly recommend this for those who want to know the truth of how animals are treated. Every aspect of the animals lives are presented in this film. If it does not turn you into a vegetarian, you might, at least, think about it. This documentary may as well be up there as one of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie illustrates very, very clearly, that there are acts of violence in this world that so many of use are contributing to, albeit unknowingly in many cases.I think its probably pretty fair to say that we all want a world with less violence, a world with more kindness.What can you do to make this happen? The solution is beautifully simple: Be the change you want to see in the world. (Those are Ghandi's words, not mine, by the way) If you want a world in which there is less violence, stop contributing to violence in the world.Violence begets violence....and Peace begets Peace.Deep down, we all know this to be true.It takes a willingness to change, as a person, to implement these changes. That can be scary, because to say that there is something about oneself that needs to change is to admit to being imperfect.Be brave. Do WHAT YOU CAN to contribute less to violence, whatever it is, and your world will be less violent, and more peaceful.If you only feel comfortable with a small change at first, then make that change, and you will be rewarded with a greater sense of peace. This process of change and reward may continue for the rest of your life.I can tell you from my experience, this has been, and is, a very rewarding process for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As many other have stated about this film. I still wonders WHY isn't a film such as this up on regular television?Humanity showed its faces in our more modern world during world war II and how the Nazis treated jews, gypsies and other people that didn't fit their kingdom. Stalin showed his way of tormenting his own people with starvation etc. estimated losses under stalins rule comes up to 40 million people.Now this we air on TV's we read about it in school and everybody are horrified how humans could do such acts of terror well take a look at this film and you will see that we are still doing it the only thing is we have turned to other species than ourselves. But everything from what we saw in world war ii is here and even worse things than that in my opinion.I simply can't understand how we can ignore these slaughter houses anylonger. It makes my blood boil when I see the people working in theses places, if someone where to die in pain it should be the human doing what he/she does.I fell ashamed to be among humans when I see that we are so many that are capable of doing theses sic things. OF COURSE I must add that NOT all slaughter houses do act like these but there are many and they are totally legal... its insane!I hope that someday this film ends up on TV everywhere and that humans will say NO! We did stop what happened during the nazi regime. Stop this as well!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually shocking, but somewhat lacking in logic and conclusions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to go out on a limb here and criticize this movie quite a bit, so if you think a movie concerning a worthy cause must not be criticized please stop reading now :-)Let's start with the good: Earthlings is a unique and visually shocking insight into how animals are mistreated (this word doesn't do the cruelty justice) in our civilization, with focus on food production, clothing, entertainment and research. It opens ones eyes to condemnable practices beyond anything that you thought could be possible, that however seem to be all too common in those industries. Some might consider the videos shown disgusting, however I'd dare to say that there are humans even capable of this is even more shocking than the visuals of slaughtered animals.So let's gets to the bad: The movie is in many parts very unspecific, showing atrocity after atrocity, while only rarely explaining why this happens (legal situation? slaughterers doing it for fun?) or alternatives (cost?). It also does for the most part not differentiate in any way between practices in different countries. I'm sure that many of the things shown are illegal and uncommon in some countries of the world. Naming those countries that ALLOW these atrocities by name would have been a very good idea.The film's general theme therefor is very negative - pretending the ONLY way out of this madness is veganism, COMPLETELY ignoring ANY other ways that could significantly improve the situation (for example regulations from the government). In addition to this, it claims that the despicable torture of these animals is necessary for the industry, even though the movie itself shows in a few cases that "humane" treatment and fairly painless killing of animals is just a question of slightly higher costs.Then right before in the end, the documentary completely disposes of any logic and reason: While the whole movie's theme is that animals are so much like us in regards to consciousness, pain and their body/brain, it starts to completely deny any relationship between humans and animals once the usage of animals of medical research becomes the topic. I fully agree that some (much?) of this research is morally despicable, but suddenly claiming that there is ABSOLUTELY no benefit to us humans from doing research on lab animals, while at the same time claiming they are suddenly SO very different from us is just totally absurd. Surely those scientists must all be doing those experiments just to inflict pain for their personal pleasure, after all why else would they be doing this research if there is no benefit at all? The whole reasoning presented here in this part of the movie is absurd, lacks any logic and really harms the movie's message by saying to the viewer who notices: "we don't care about truth, we care about animals!".And then, right before the end, he goes on by listing pretty much every major illness humans face including cancer then blaming them ALL on the fact that we eat meat. Well, I guess the world really is just black and white for those guys...The movie closes by reminding us that ALL animals used in the areas of food production, cloth production and science die in pain beyond belief. Every single one of them. Yeah, that really what they claim, even though their own movie in a few cases has shown that painless killing is possible and often is not done just because of slightly higher costs. Of course facts are not in line with the movies general message are completely ignored (animals can die very painfully in nature too) and the only "solution" presented here is again: Become a vegan, or you're responsible for this.To sum it up: Shocking pictures, worth seeing and thinking about. But don't expect a well researched report that gives you numbers or percents or names (virtually no effort is made to show how common some methods are), or even proposes solutions (except veganism). This movie was made to shock and to convince by shock only, objectivity was lost somewhere along the way.I'd rate it at 6.5 / 10, because even though it does not care about truth and objectivity (which I think are quite important in a documentary) it is still very much worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a crash course on animal rights...a must see for anyone who cares about animals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started reading about human rights when I was around 18 after i had been arrested I began reading the world section of newspapers. I discovered that the world beyond America is very different, many people in America have serious problems, poverty can kill here too, but in comparison to parts of Africa and places all over the globe, places as close as hati, America is heaven. So I joined a human rights group at UCONN and learned a lot. Its on thing to be aware of world issues but to really research the problems changes your perspective on life, on justice really. I had a dog for 17 years his name was comet, he was my best friend. He got hit by a car, I was getting ready to work the 3rd shift at espn the car droveaway, I'm thankful it did I don't know what I would have done to the driver. His death changed my life, like the death of a close family member it didn't matter that he was "just" a dog to me, for months nothing seemed to be right, colors were off, the sky wasn't right, my conversations meant nothing, life was dark. I don't remember how but I came across a man named Gary Francione, and read his book an "introduction to animal rights your child or the dog?". I was never the same after reading that book, I didn't know there were law professors writing about what I felt. since then I have read many books, watched hours of video of abuse and whatever else I came across to better understand the plight of animals, the unnecessary pain. I could not watch this movie straight on thru, I needed to watch it in pieces, it was the most honest film I have ever seen about the way we treat animals as things, and not sentient creatures. I didn't think you could make a movie like that, I didn't think anyone cared but I was wrong, a lot of people care. start with yourself, giving up animal products is the surest way you can help animals, learn about going vegan. good luck</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching a documentary like this is not an easy thing to do. But it is something that all people should do. The way animals are treated by humans is nothing short of horrific. The sad fact is that people don't want to be educated in this regard. It is far easier for them to remain ignorant. The question that I was constantly asking myself throughout this film, is "how can people work in these places, and inflict the level of cruelty to these animals so blatantly". Perhaps they are numb to it. But I guess the fact that they can become numb to is means that there is probably no hope for these animals at all. The truly sad part is that many of them seemed to enjoy their work. I certainly hope that I am wrong. This documentary covers *all* facets of human speciesism (a term that is referred to throughout the film). Pets, and pet abuse, animals for food and clothing, cruelty to animals in the name of human entertainment, zoos, circuses. Although I do consider myself to be an educated vegan, I did learn a lot from watching this documentary. The tone in which Joaquin Phoenix narrated was very compelling. You can tell that he is passionate about the subject.I suspect that only a vegan or perhaps a vegetarian would be able to watch this all the way through. Most people that support the industries that are outlined within the film, would likely turn it off when it gets to the graphic sections, as they wouldn't want to be put off their dinner. As the film says, it's easier to remain ignorant, so that you don't have to battle with your conscience and make the hard decisions.I urge everyone that gets the opportunity to see this documentary, to do so. It really is an education indeed. It can be purchased on line from http://www.isawearthlings.com/</fullReview>

Also the meat industry urgently needs a re-haul. I have always wondered that if people stopped eating meat, would humans evolve to become herbivores? To me that seems to make logical sense. Also there is no longer a need at least in the Western world to use animals for clothing. The sale of fur and leather is an abomination. Experiments must be ceased immediately.

I was actually a vegetarian upon finding this film, however i wasn't educated on what really happens, i had seen a few videos on YouTube, but not really. Watching this film made me Vegan and reaffirmed what i believe. Don't let that put you off the film however, many fear being ''converted'' but please don't let that put you off. It is not the film that will convert you, it is the reality, your emotions, your morals and your logic that will. I think rather than ''converting'' people, it ''uncovers'' you. It is worth watching if you want to respect your food on your plate and know what has happened to that animal, or if your are on the fence with the animal industry, or if you simply want to understand more of what happens, be that a meat eater, veggie, or vegan. It does come with a warning though - it will (if you love/like/respect animals like me) destroy your emotions. But what a tiny price to pay when you see what these animals go through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Horrible Truth Behind Our Food</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regardless of your views on animal rights or whether or not you eat meat, everyone should watch "Earthlings.""Earthings" shows the horrible truth behind where our food comes from and what these poor defenseless beings have to go through so we can fill our stomachs.Prepare to be shocked and repulsed. I realize in giving that warning, people will want to avoid this film. The truth is horrible and we have been living in lies if we pretend that we are not accountable for the cruelty inflicted on these beings on our behalf. Meat-eaters and lacto-ovo vegetarians will want to avoid this film out of guilt. Vegans will want to avoid it because they are against violence. Everyone will want to avoid it because it is hard to confront.Regardless if you watch "Earthlings" or not, we are all responsible and will someday be accountable. If you choose to continue to eat meat, dairy, and eggs after watching this film, at least you will do so knowing what you are doing to these beings.We have all been brainwashed by tradition and marketing into ignoring the truth behind where the food comes from. It is time to wake up.You can watch "Earthings" for free on the internet. There is no excuse to live our lives in ignorance.</fullReview>

This documentary is an hypnotic trip in one of the darkest face of our civilization many people ignores.This is a easy way to understand and feel the philosophical roots of a major problem for all those who won't have the chance to read Peter Singer (one of the world's greatest ethic specialist) books.Earthlings make you rethink about the animal and human condition on earth.

		<shortDescription>Another Inconvenient Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree completely with the comments hurshykalsi525 from Australia made, except for one small difference. I do not believe that eating meat is by definition the wrong thing to do. People are, biologically speaking, animals and there are plenty of animals that eat meat and therefor kill other animals. The difference between animals and most humans is that animals basically kill their prey because they need the food to survive (or perhaps need to teach their young to survive by hunting prey). Human 'civilisation' kills other animals for fun, lack of respect and greed.If this film shows anything, it is that we humans have definitely got our priorities and morals wrong! .... another inconvenient truth most people refuse to see .... or do something about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So some of the ill treatment of animals that this movie uncovered was known to me. But much was not. And to see it, rather than hear it....well, brings the point home.I forced myself to watch it, crying the whole way through. And it still isn't enough. I am not a perfect vegan. I haven't gone out to protest animal testing or the fur wearers. But it helps.What I'm afraid of is that the people who don't already believe, who don't care, wont force themselves to watch it. Will turn a blind eye. But maybe, bit by bit the world will know and change....I hope...anyway. And I think this movie is important....I could wish that everyone were forced to see it, to learn and understand, and THINK!!! Not everyone needs to agree, but it's an important discussion.Documentaries are often one sided, and evidence is usually less than scientifically presented (though the content had some insightful scientific arguments mentioned). So I was prepared, going in, for that, well, to me it didn't matter, because suffering is suffering, and that is the point.But what did rub me the wrong way was the reference to economics. Now my memory is slightly hazy on the script, but I believe the message was something along the lines that economics drives people to do bad things to animals for profit. Just to clarify: economics is a discipline that attempts to understand and predict human behavior. It is not a motivation. Greed, self-interest, whatever you want to call it...that is the motivation. In fact, economic theory can tell us how to provide incentives to change people's behavior once we know/understand the motivation. It is a useful tool, not a bad thing. Being an economist I get a little sensitive about trashing the discipline...particularly when it is so useful in the contexts that trash it. So forgive me for going on a bit of a tirade here.</fullReview>

But the problem is that most people don't have the empathy to change their eating habits.It is more likely that a vegetarian becomes a vegan after watching this film than a fat ignorant person will spend time thinking about nutrition. Most people will close their eyes and/ or tell themselves something like "Ok this is happening in USA and I'm living in Italy so it really isn't my problem" etc.There must be a change in the society to really change anything. This film should be broad-casted on mayor TV stations. People really need to know what they are doing by eating meat and how much energy and pollution meat eating is causing.

		<fullReview>As some pointed out, no answers. Just a sad reflection. But rather than pull it apart too much, I wanted to point out to all the vegetarians out there the following: Lobby groups pressed ALL governments over many years to raise the bar when it comes to allowing new pharmaceutical products onto the market. It is good to have a degree of obvious measures in place, but the rigorous testing required for government (eg FDA) approval is extremely burdensome. As a consequence, one of the best ways for pharmaceutical companies to meet these increasingly higher standards is to prove that the new drug actually treats the illness and has not or very few low-impact side effects. And how do they prove it? By testing it on animals! Yes - we know that liquid paper is harmful to the human eye because the manufacturers observed the destruction it causes to rabbit eyes. And yes, chickens are cramped up in cages in shocking conditions before they are killed and put on a supermarket hot-chicken rotisserie. But it is pointless protesting against that so vehemently, but somewhat "excusing" pharmaceutical companies doing the same thing because it is in the interest of the heath and well-being of humans. A lot of soap-avoiding vegans will still take anti-biotics. Do they know what and how many animals were sacrificed (probably in a cruel and inhumane fashion) to get that product on the shelf? There's a contradiction there that is only further fueled when the same soap-avoid vegans want more government regulation of big multi-national corporations such as pharmaceutical companies. This results in more animal testing, that doesn't necessarily catch everything anyway. How did Vioxx get through?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You would be hard pressed to really call Earthlings a documentary. It's an hour and a half of animal cruelty clips strung together with rambling pseudo-philosophical narration. Many of the clips aren't even recent and have been floating around youtube for years.Moreso Earthlings falls into the same trap that so many documentaries do. It over-saturates the audience without providing any real information. 100% about the problem, 0% about a solution. Sure there's lots of gross, graphic images from all over the world in this film but not much else. Instead of focusing on a solution and informing the audience of how to change laws or live cruelty-free the entire film is just a constant stream of 'This is bad. This is mean. Look at how mean it is.' Audiences will leave disgusted but quickly tune it out and fall back into bad habits with no outlet or information on how to change those behaviors.If they're trying to change skeptics minds, they have no chance. There's nothing concrete such as scientific reports or even a single 'expert' put forth in this movie for anyone who wants more than just ramblings about feelings and clips of animals frolicking in nature. It's just a constant stream of clips -- some of which clearly seem to date back to the 70s or perhaps even 60s -- set to music and narration.You could get the same for free from youtube with the same level of educational value. Being shocking alone doesn't make a documentary or good documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Truely man is the king of beasts, for his brutality exceeds theirs." Leonard da Vinci.Perhaps, too preachy at points and ridiculously, disturbingly graphic, but this film demands to be seen. As a warning, this is the hardest film by far I've ever had to endure, even harder than 'Nuit et Brouillard', I had to stop the movie a few times and have a cup of tea and calm down such was the relentless barrage of horrific image. I'm going to spoil a bit of the film to give some potential viewers a taste (although I'd describe it as 'fair warning' rather than a spoiler). A scene depicts a dog in Turkey being thrown into a garbage crusher. This really hit home for me, however, not in a graphic exploitative way. The message of the movie is a little more profound than that. Its central point is ignorance, it made me realise how ignorant I am and most people are about the way food and clothing is produced and made. The ultimate consequences of capitalism laid bare. Animals are treated commodities now and not as living beings. 'Earthlings' reaffirms my view that documentaries have the power to change our attitudes and to lift the veil on modern society. Even in overtly biased style still touches upon something irrevocably human and universal. All the ugly glory of the world's attitudes towards animals and the environment should be laid bare for people to know. We should know the facts and we should have the right to choose based on this information. A reaffirmation of both horror and hope in humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Response to critical comments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel the need to respond to some of the criticisms I read in the comments on here. In many of the low reviews people cite two main reasons, they call it vegan/PETA propaganda or they say it is too violent and disgusting. Obviously it is "propaganda" for animal rights activists, that is the whole point of the movie. Everything documentary, book, pamphlet, speech etc. that was directed towards a purpose in the past was propaganda too. Martin Luther King's "I have a dream" speech was propaganda for the civil rights movement, that did not mean he did not have a point or he was wrong, but he certainly did not give the arguments of white southerners equal weight did he? Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Susan B. Anthony, and every other human rights campaigner in history did the same. But please remember, none of these now famous civil rights campaigns were universally accepted in the past. Nelson Mandela was put in jail (and not just by the white South African government, the US government supported them for many many years). MLK was shot, female suffragettes were beat up and ridiculed. The pattern is the same, and the documentary identifies it in the first minute. Resistance to the truth Step 1: Ridicule (call it propaganda) Step 2: Violent Resistance Step 3: Acceptance.For all the others who say its too violent, well that is the point, it is showing the reality of the animal product consumption industry. Do you complain that a documentary about the holocaust is too violent? Get real. Using this as a criticism is honestly sickening and it shows just how detached from reality some people are. Reality does not have a Hollywood happy ending. This is what happens, this is where your meat comes from. Shutting your eyes to the reality and ignoring it will not make it go away. How many Germans simply shut their eyes to what was happening around them? Yes nature is cruel, yes lions kill zebra and eat them alive. Does that mean that we humans as sentient self-aware creatures are justified in doing the same? It reminds me a debate that Friedrich Hayek and John Rawls had about what constitutes a just society. Hayek said that nature is inherently "unfair" and the sooner "liberals" like Rawls deal with that fact the better off we will be. Rawls brilliantly responded that nature is neither fair nor unfair, it simply is nature, and how we deal with that fact is what makes our society fair or unfair.I am not saying Earthlings is the best documentary ever, nor do I completely agree with all of PETA or the documentary's positions. I am also not a vegan. This film is difficult to watch, and it should be.</fullReview>

Sadly, this is what most cowards would do.But I made a deal with myself, I promised myself that I would watch this gruesome collection of footage later. And I am glad I did. It truly opened my eyes and I was shocked about the way that our species (the beasts) treated our fellow earthlings (the animals). It shows a lot of concerning facts and I totally agree that we have to change the ways we treat animals.However, I don't agree that we shouldn't eat meat at all. We are omnivores in the end. But I do think we should treat the animals better. Give them a life worth living, no more pain and a quick death. And the documentary does stimulate me to eat less meat and more meat substitutes. So I think that's a positive thing.You should watch this documentary in my opinion. It opens your eyes and it contains footage that I had never seen before myself.

		<fullReview>I've always enjoyed and found good use in watching this type of documentaries- a type that shows you the cruel and harsh reality of these days' industry, deforestation, over processed food, and the list goes on. But "Earthlings" is not just that - it is not only a collage of different stories about how we, as humans, abuse of our power and privileges here on Earth. It's incredibly real, very harsh and also tries to soften the viewer to a different way o living, not only concerning alimentation, clothing, but also our way of thinking, our psychology. I personally liked the documentary, it showed me an insight to cruelty I could not fathom possible but as I do not lack knowledge and documentation in the areas covered by the story, I also found 3 main errors made only for the sake of the "wow factor". SPOILER! 1. The narrator uses the word "speciesism" a word from the same family with "sexism" and "racism", in regard to discrimination of other species than the human one. This idea may sound appealing and real, but let's be honest : if it were true, it's not just the human race that embraces this speciesism. If it were true, we would have to condemn every single lion, crocodile, shark, bat, bear, wolf, seal, and even dog for this "speciesim". So the starting idea of the movie is extremely wire-drawn an actually kind of wrong. 2. Part 5 of the documentary concerns the scientific research that uses animals as testers. Although it is earlier implied that animals do feel exactly the same amount of pain as humans, that they react just like us, in this part of the documentary the narrator seems to forget the earlier statement, and goes on saying that vivisections and experiments n animals should not be done, because animals react VERY differently from humans. How convenient! 3. In the same part of the documentary the viewer is shown and explained different techniques used on these laboratory animals that are not only extremely old and no longer used but also a little exaggerated.Apart from these 3 things that bothered me, the documentary is actually quite informative BUT (!) watch out, very disturbing for the majority. The fact that Joaquin Phoenix narrated only makes me sort of forget some minuses of this film, as he does a great job.To sum up, I recommend this documentary to those who wonder where the meat from their plates came from, the leather from their boots and jackets, the medicine that keep them alive. And for God's sake, you really should wonder...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will start with a common phrase that I see a lot when reading reviews...I don't write reviews, as simple as that. And honestly I would have not reviewed this movie either (the title for me says it all for who wants to see it and there are critics out there who can put it better in words than me) but some reviews on this movie are completely appalling and every time I read them I understand that there is no coincidence to the status humankind is in today...if only stupidity would hurt!Few simple examples while browsing through them:1. The movie is not about transforming us in vegetarians! People completely missed the point to this movie, its about making people aware of how completely rotten the food chain is nowadays! Please give me one example where the narrator is saying this in the movie, just one!!! 2. Natural selection?!?! Are people serious when talking about natural selection when talking about this movie and farming?!?! We are breeding to kill!!! Where is the natural selection in here?!?! 3. Another one that I liked a lot - if we wouldn't eat meat we would have not developed our brains, as brains need a lot of calories - OKAY super developed fellow human being, based on your assumption all carnivore animals should have outsmarted us long time ago as this is what they eat all day long!!!! 4. Animals are killing themselves - why can't we, its written in the Bible anyway?! - Again, are you serious?! Animals kill for food, and only when they are hungry, and this is NATURAL SELECTION (show me a wildlife obese animal). This is their only meal - NO OTHER CHOICE, plain and simple as they are carnivores. Don't forget that many do great service to earth by eating dead animals and thus avoid spreading diseases, etc. The topic is so long, that I can't believe it needs writing to some people. Even without National Geographic in your life you should know elementary life science from school!!! 5. Again, nobody said turn vegetarian - but raise your own food like our not so long ago great grandparents used to do. And yes, do hunt like our ancestors! If all of those were still true today, we wouldn't be 7bil polluting the world and NATURAL SELECTION would have taken its course! Don't forget, animals are not used just for food, they dress you, they are exposed to all kinds of testing to make sure you are 'protected' in all sorts of environments and industries, and they try and make you happy when you come from work! How many of you know how many types of dog breeds were 100 years ago?! Did all these breeds happen naturally overnight?The film mentions three big entities that governs earth: Nature, Animals and Humankind - and I am sure one day we will all kneel in from of the first one as it won't bare the atrocities that we are doing day after day to our Planet.Until then, hope more people will open their eyes to the real meaning of life and truth behind it...and looking forward to the moment when this video (its fully available on youtube for viewing) will reach the same amount of viewers of the ridiculous song Gangnam Style!</fullReview>

Thank you for showing the deeper processes of our lives.I hope this movie could help others to understand more about themselves as part of the mankind. Don't be ignorant. Be aware and respectful of your life and us, human-beings, and all others - earthlings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A harrowing experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me 3 days to finish watching this. Haven't seen a more harrowing documentary. This actually goes on to prove that humans are the most cruel of all animals on this planet. The documentary talks about animals in five different parts. They are shown as pets, as a source of food, entertainment, clothes and experimental subjects. The tortures which the animals are subjected to and the different manners of killing them are shown in their full brutality. Many of the scenes are more disturbing than any of the movies which contain so called graphic scenes. The viewer will be appalled and horrified as to what these animals are subjected to. Just closing our eyes and thinking that the animals are treated humanely before they are dispatched to the other world is naive. watch this and prepare to be blown literally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must advise that this documentary/movie/film narrows very disturbing subjects and if you wanna watch be morally prepared because you are never going to experience your local market the same way. And you will fell bad about yourself in allot of situations afterward. This was the only movie, ever, that made me cry. I saw it alone and by the end of 20 minutes I was tearing apart. I felt ashamed on the way we allow things like this to happen. I understand it's impossible to remove meat from our food chain but we could at least treat the animals with dignity and praise them for what they provide to us. They're lives!The movie will show you how immune and grotesque we as human beings can be. And most of it falls in the same category reduce cost or by other words make some people richer by taking advantage of the defenseless ones, in these case the animals and people with no other life choices that must take a apart on this...I can say this movie can change your life but the solution is not on ones single hands and changes on politics have to be implemented in order to prevent this, hopefully some of tomorrow leaders will watch this and take measures in the future.One sentence remain staggered in my head:"As long as there are slaughterhouses, there will be battlefields".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well to be honest , this documentary made me cringe in my seat and cry and saddened at parts where animals are tortured. It outlines the way in which animals are exploited in multiple nations for food,product testing etc, including where I reside (considering majority of vegans come from India).You may look at this documentary from the view as a critic or a sympathetic person, but the fact remains that we are destroying the natural equilibrium of nature around us. (No mention of poaching in this particular documentary as that also is cruel and selfish by us "humane" humans. )We can always change.. change for good and this particular documentary would make us think hard and analyze how we humans are part of a society which destroys other societies in order to just spend our lives on planet earth.Being an Indian made me default to vegetarian diet, but as I grew up I experimented with my diet and switched to white meat as I wanted to bulk up and was into bodybuilding. I was frustrated with eating vegan food and gaining bulk. Perhaps I was naive by considering that eating meat would do me good.! But now I won't and not at the cost of inhumane behavior and torture of animals . It may not be a revolutionary change but every drop added builds an ocean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some People Actually See The Movie And Do Something, But Other Decide To Just Say What They Plan And Never Do Anything. Do We Realize That We Have Just One Planet To Live in? We Can Change What We Have Created And Help Animals, The Environment, And Our Future Offsprings By Changing It. The Only Thing In Our Way To Accomplish A Better World, Is Our Ignorance And Stubbornness. We Are A Food Chain &amp; If We Keep Ficking The WWorld Up, We Will Regret It When We Are Too Late to Actually Fix It! These Are Some Ideas To Make A Change: 1. CHANGE YOUR LIGHT If every household in the United State replaced one regular light bulb with one of those new compact fluorescent bulbs, the pollution reduction would be equivalent to removing one million cars from the road.Don't like the color of light? Use these bulbs for closets, laundry rooms and other places where it won't irk you as much. 2. TURN OFF COMPUTERS AT NIGHT By turning off your computer instead of leaving it in sleep mode, you can save 40 watt-hours per day. That adds up to 4 cents a day, or $14 per year. If you don't want to wait for your computer to start up, set it to turn on automatically a few minutes before you get to work, or boot up while you're pouring your morning cup 'o Joe. 3. DON'T RINSE Skip rinsing dishes before using your dishwasher and save up to 20 gallons of water each load. Plus, you're saving time and the energy used to heat the additional water. 4. DO NOT PRE-HEAT THE OVEN Unless you are making bread or pastries of some sort, don't pre-heat the oven. Just turn it on when you put the dish in. Also, when checking on your food, look through the oven window instead of opening the door. 5. RECYCLE GLASS Recycled glass reduces related air pollution by 20 percent and related water pollution by 50 percent. If it isn't recycled it can take a million years to decompose.</fullReview>

About a half-hour into it, I really became overwhelmed by it all, but managed to keep it together and finish it.It's hard not to lose all hope in humanity after seeing the brutality in these clips. The very fact that certain people take the initiative to make these documentaries is pretty much the only thing that gives me hope; that, and people's acts of kindness I witness now and then.I'm not a vegetarian (yet...), but I've curbed my consumption of animal products over the last decade, and I plan to continue.

		<shortDescription>Monumental film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went vegan about a month ago after watching a pretty gruesome video about slaughterhouses. I'd heard Ellen Degeneres recommend Earthlings as a life-changer and knew I should watch it, but dreaded seeing it. I thought, "If that short video I saw before tore me up so much, will I ever recover from a one and a half hour video full of similar footage?" Finally yesterday, I decided I'd just watch it in five-minute increments, day by day. On the first five-minute day, I watched the whole thing, finger on the pause button ready to strike. But I couldn't turn away. Even though I was bawling like a baby at some scenes while simultaneously yelling at the people in a scarily feral voice, "How can you DO that? What are you doing? How can you DO that?? Oh my god!!" I was still thankful to have seen what I saw. It gave me an energy and purpose I hadn't felt before. Before was just guilt and powerlessness. That sense of purpose lit a fire in me to push myself to be an integral part of ending the suffering.I immediately wrote to Ellen Degeneres and thanked her for having the courage (along with so many) to speak out about the unspeakable acts that give "humanity" a very bad and sick name. But I also told her that I feel very positive that thanks to people like her, and people now like me, we can end this. I feel truly in my heart that this movement is starting to snowball. I love that glamorous superstars and athletes are speaking out about this, because it's making people take notice and stop and consider before they bury their necks in the sand, as I have done most of my life with the encouragement of those around me.Every since I was little, I felt that killing animals was just wrong in every sense. Even though I ate meat, I constantly had this nagging haze over my head knowing something was very off and that I wasn't aligned with my principles. Up until very recently I bought leather and reasoned that the animal was killed for meat anyway. (How wrong was I?) It is easy to turn the other way. But the peace that comes with finally facing what you knew to be wrong and changing your life so that you no longer contribute to the harm? So priceless and wonderful, like my soul finally settled where it was supposed to go. We drove through by fields of cows the other day and I looked at them and thought, "I will never harm you again." My greatest gratitude goes to the undercover activists who went secretly filmed these scenes -- your courage floors me. I don't know how you did it but I'm grateful you did. And to the people who created the film: what an incredible gift to the animals and the world. I just want to save and enfold those animals that died and are dying now into a world that dignifies them.So my advice? See the movie and try to get at least one other person to see it. Pass it on.

		<fullReview>This film has profoundly effected the way I view the world. As citizens of a western society we are programed from an early age to eat a balanced diet of the 4 basic food groups. Unfortunately, half of those food groups (meat and milk products) consist of the exploitation of animals on a mass scale.At times this film disgusted me, but for the most part is just depressed me. If your intent is to open your eyes to a harsh reality this film is for you. However, if you'd rather live a blissfully ignorant life, DO NOT watch this film.My gluttony has prevented me from a total vegetarian transition but I now feel a great sense of responsibility in the way I spend my money at the grocery store.

I can only believe that this is a move that appeals heavily to those already converted to veganism or something?Yes, some of the scenes were barbaric and I firmly believe in honesty about where our food comes from and where it is manufactured.I didn't feel this was an honest film however. It doesn't show the "standard practices" - some of what it shows is, and what really happens in abattoirs is gruesome - and hell, I'm glad I'm not a cow - but this smacks of propaganda rather than a documentary. There is no evenness to it.And additionally - there is no interest in it. I had to fast forward the first section as it was incredibly long and tedious. Phoenix's voice is (pretty sure intentionally) inflectionless. Monotonous.I had no problem with the subject matter - but as a film, it's just bad.Something like Food Inc gets its point across much better - and the movie has a narrative, a story, something to draw you in.This movie just preaches to the converted.Bleh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film depicts a microcosm of everything you never wanted to know about the treatment of animals worldwide, from the various meat and animal product industries to animal testing and research to the pet euthanasia epidemic.I made the transition to a vegetarian diet over the past two weeks, and I heard about and watched this movie yesterday. I cried a few times during the film; I had to pause it and take breaks because I couldn't deal with what I was seeing; and on several occasions I wanted to just stop watching. In the end, I made it through the entire movie in about three hours. This morning I couldn't eat breakfast, and tonight I am still dealing with stress and depression as I attempt to process the horrors that I have witnessed.I am traumatized. I will never look at a jug of milk, a carton of eggs, a leather belt, an animal fur, or any piece of meat the same way again.Nor should anyone.The revelations contained within this film are, without a doubt, among the greatest gifts that I have ever received in my life. I have spent twenty-nine years on this Earth living in ignorance of the oceans of blood that are spilled daily for the sake of my convenience and comfort; having now been duly informed, I have arrived at the inevitable conclusion that I can do just fine with a bit less of both. If, like me, you wish for these horrors to stop, then you need only to stop Demanding that they continue; the rest will sort itself out naturally.</fullReview>

I now know for sure that I'll never go back to meat, fish, dairy, leather etc. Too many people ignore what's happening because they don't want to know the truth.

		<fullReview>The problems with Earthlings is mostly from the effect has on people. Due to the nature of the film, people come away from it with an OMG reaction which is what the documentary was going for, but relies on emotion more then facts. Throughout the film, they say that these are the norm, however many times they will show other countries, now if people live here and support the AR movement then cool, however I can't help what another country does to it's animals, we have enough trouble trying to do it for humans. Now that isn't to say you shouldn't care, I simply believe that they presented the worst situations, said they were the norm (perhaps because they went only to bad farms?), and the solution given wasn't to improve conditions it was to not eat meat at all.Now, the computer industry isn't exactly good for the environment (even through recycling), but are you going to give up your computers or would you rather improve the industry? Just saying.If you want to get someone interested into caring for animals who doesn't, this is a good doc., but it should be used more for informing on the worst not a reason to change your diet.If you think that killing animals is equal to murdering humans you will likely disagree with me, however it isn't about you reaffirming what you already believe in, its about trying to get people to care. People will disagree with you, and this film (as they should) but it shows that we do need to improve how we treat animals."We eat animals, they deserve respect from us." -Temple Grandin</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Speak up for the silent victims</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of years ago while I was searching on the Internet I found video clips like these and that's when I started to think "Should I turn into a vegetarian?" Before that I didn't have a clue about what was going on in the slaughterhouses. After I watched this movie I've learned a lot of things and I was hurt. I kept searching &amp; watching &amp; reading. I'm 18 now and I've been a vegan for a year and hopefully will be for the rest of my life. The earlier people watch these cruel acts on animals the earlier they become considerate about what they eat, wear or do. Apart from many other informative documentaries, this documentary in particular should be shown in schools. These are not the "standard care" for animals obviously but it doesn't change the fact that it's still happening or has happened sometime somewhere. The film doesn't show any solutions some people say, that's because YOU ARE the solution. Every person in this animal activism counts. This film is the very film that urges you to think about living things, your surroundings as well as your future. In tens, hundreds of years more people will become vegan, more people will treat nature with respect because that's what people will become obliged to do with the increasing population. That's what is needed for a sustainable, healthy and a happy life of earthlings."Earthlings" gets to you and affects you in every way. Your attitude, your state of mind, your manners. If you call it a manipulation of emotions just because it shows disgusting and disturbing videos of torture, that's also fine. Because people generally don't tend to do anything until their feelings are touched by something horrible. This film provides this chance, a chance to be informed and start to do something other than what you are used to do, a chance to be finally aware and review your life choices once again. Speak up for the silent victims, speak up for our billions of friends.</fullReview>

Human beings will not suddenly become perfect if we stopped eating and utilizing animals and let them run amok. Our human nature is fallen, and as a Christian, the Bible warns that we should "not fall to hollow and deceitful philosophy of guiding spirits instead of that of Christ".Jesus taught "It is not what goes into a person that defiles him, but what departs from him that defiles him". By that he was not talking about physical excrement, but verbal excrement.No vegan film out there will make me want to give up my dietary choices.

I could never bare to finance others into the level of cruelty inflicted to innocent beings for the sole reason of tasty food (which is not tasty to me anymore after eating vegan for 4 years). This movie is a real life horror story. The worst I've seen but also the best, because ignorance hurts, it hurts a lot and it feels great to redeem ourselves. Ignorance causes pain and cruelty in our planet and it's time for us to realize it, to educate ourselves and choose. We place our vote into the world with every coin we spend. This movie is truly hard to watch, you'll cry a lot if you happen to be sensitive or not at all. It's eye opening not only as a human person but as an Earthling.Interestingly it doesn't leave you with a bad taste of mouth but on the contrary, full of hope and action.

		<shortDescription>'Earthlings' Presents an Inconvenient Truth about Human Nature!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early on, Earthlings, a documentary film by Shaun Monson, presents striking images of Nazi genocidal atrocities towards Jews, which elicit a curious cognitive dissonance in the viewer's mind - certainly the Jews were cruelly "treated like animals", but on this occasion we are moved to ask a different question: should even animals be treated this way? Or did the Nazi treatment of Jews stem in fact from the socially accepted reduction of animals to mere objects? From there on, it goes on to discuss the extent of modern society's pervasive speciesism, successively covering five expanses: Pets, Food, Clothes, Entertainment and Science. The ordering of this sequence is cunning and effective, and it helps Monson make his case about the endemic nature of speciesism in our society.Earthlings speaks to our innate sense of compassion. Something that is there inside all of us, but needs a reawakening. It is a movie that examines our spiritual conscience, personal evolution and so much more. I did have to prepare myself before I watched it mentally not to cry through the entire movie. I managed to get by with tears welling up in my eyes, and some trickling down my face, but that was unavoidable. If you have at least a bit of a heart within you, this movie is going to make you cringe at times and evoke some serious emotion, but that is not a good enough reason not to see it. I'm not going to attempt to describe the ghastly scenes in Earthlings. There were parts I missed because I had to turn away. At other times I acted like a little kid watching a horror film, covering my face with my hands, only watching what could slip through the cracks between my fingers. But this is no horror movie. Earthlings is real. Yes, it is inconvenient to find this out. Yes, it is going to make you rethink your ways, and yes, it may lead you to make some major changes in your life, but that is what evolution of the human being and spirit is all about.As a production, Monson's Earthlings is a meticulously crafted work, featuring narration by Joaquin Phoenix, a moodily effective musical score by Moby, and rare footage from inside the animal factory farming industry that must have been difficult to acquire, giving it the right atmosphere and the right facts to really drive the message home.Earthlings forcefully, sometimes disturbingly, reminds us of an essential character of our consciousness, something about ourselves that our culture often dismisses: compassion and empathy. Along the way it shows and tells some inconvenient truths that most of us would probably prefer to avoid, laying bare a mass hypocrisy that we mindlessly accept. Earthlings shows us what is right there to see, if we would only look directly and honestly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary has both good things and bad things to it. On the plus side, it represents a lot of realities that you may not be aware of. Even though I had previously regarded videos about animal farms, this was the first time that I have went through the subject of animals for human consumption in all of its span. The fact that this documentary goes beyond food, into the topic of entertainment, clothing, etc. will let you come face to face with realities that you were ignorant of, and give you a lot of food for thought. On the negative side, this documentary is highly biased. The author is intentionally focusing on the worst case scenarios and, due to his own ignorance, spreads some ignorance and common misconceptions. The point were this was more noticeable to me, was when he was discussing scientific testing on animals, were he shows that he does not comprehend what is the purpose of animal testing. One simple example of that is vaccines, as the first vaccine was developed thanks to animal testing. Also, animal testing is carried with very strict regulations when it comes to causing pain or discomfort, and is not used to replace human testing, but rather to complement it. Similarly to this bias, you have biases on the topic of food, were he only covers mass production farms; leather production, were he focuses only on the worst case scenario that is the Indian market of leather; on the fur farms in China; etc.In the end I recommend this video, as it will give you a lot to think about, and it will show you a lot of things you might be ignorant of.</fullReview>

The scale of this suffering can not be taken in. Not only do we ignore the suffering, we take our sustenance from it and adorn ourselves in it. It makes the callousness to the genocide, starvation, and suffering of our fellow human beings understandable.No talking heads, statistics, historical context. It makes its point with undercover, raw footage of the animals in the factory system. It is nearly unbearable and not appropriate for children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good documentary; ridiculous stance on basic/translational animal research</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The documentary is definitely a must watch (hence the 7/10 rating) and it certainly contributed to changing my attitude regarding meat consumption.However it must be said that its stance when it comes to experiments on living animals has a fair bit of flawed reasoning and misrepresents facts. It suggests that animal testing leads to wrong conclusions (that this is the norm, not the exception) and suggests that clinical investigation is the ONLY valid kind of investigation while experiments on animals are an "insult to true science".REALLY?! these statements are completely false; What would our understanding of biology/medicine be in the absence of model organisms like mice, macaques, fruit flies or nematodes to work on? What would our understanding of genetically-predisposed disorders and their treatment be in the absence of transgenic model organisms? Besides most experiments on animals are conducted in humane conditions and surgery is generally done under anesthesia. How can such basic/translational science research that is conducted under the approval of ethics committees be dealt with on the same level as slaughter of animals for food? their stance on experiments on living animals therefore is miseducating/misinforming to an often naive public and an unwarranted villanization of animal research which has had bad repercussions and lead to vandalism in the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a life changing video. Nothing will ever be the same in the way that you view things in everyday life, the way you analyse human behaviour especially towards animals and your visit to the supermarket is most probably going to be painful after watching this "documentary".However, this production does not deserve to be called a documentary and that too an award winning documentary. This could have been much better in terms of video quality, dialogues, censors, expert opinions and people talking about the problem at hand, interviews and so much more. There is nothing in it but I should recommend watching this once. Keep children away from this, it is too cruel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps I was expecting a deeper discussion about speciesism and the ethics of modern consumption of animal commodities, but this film fell short of the mark for me. The shock value of a lot of the footage made the narrative quite disjointed and difficult to get its point across. There was one particular scene where animals are skinned alive which made me feel ill, otherwise I've seen this type of footage before. In addition, I felt much of the arguments presented were done in a heavy handed fashion. The self-righteous tone alienated me, the 'if you're not with us, you're against us' was not conductive in trying to persuade me to make an informed decision about the issues presented.Having said all that, the film does succeed in making me think about where a lot of my animal-based consumable goods come from. On this alone, it's worth watching. I just wish that it was done in a more precise and factual manner, rather than relying on emotive language and imagery (such as in Food Inc which I found to be really engaging).Finally, I'd like to say, take the film with a grain of salt. Sure, your emotions will run high at times and wish ill upon some of those portrayed in the movie. But one should seek more information about the issues presented rather than taking the movie as gospel.</fullReview>

Not to mention they take clips from movies that are similar.If you aren't vegetarian or vegan, and you want to know why people who work in slaughterhouses don't eat meat from their company, this movie is for you.I would think this would make someone already a vegetarian/vegan an animal rights activist.Personally i think the film takes animal rights to the extreme, even criticizing pet owners as a whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I used to eat meat. I still do, but I used to too.Okay, I can sum up this film up as such: shocking vegan propaganda.Yeah, it shows a lot of awful true events that happen to animals in this world. Unfortunately when talking about this it withholds all logic and reason, instead relying on pure emotion.It makes it seem like the only way to help the animals is to go vegan. Unfortunately, we have evolved in such a way that our diet really does require meat. There are other issues with global veganism as well, but let's stick with that one. We need meat. We won't stop eating meat. Do we have any other solutions? According to the video, no.According to facts, yes! Many people would rather know where their meat comes from. For example, I buy my meat from a few local farms where one can plainly see how humanely the animals are treated. Why not support places like that? Because it won't shock. We'd rather show you these horrors that happen in Turkey. Great.Oh, and we get no benefit from animal research? Yeah, scientists are surely just a bunch of sadists. I do agree though that we would learn more about a substance's effects on humans if it were tested on humans, so! Here's the sign-up list, which chemical would you like to test, sir?Animal testing is necessary, but it CAN be done humanely. We have people come into the lab on occasion to make sure the mice are in the proper cages with proper comfort and everything. But that won't shock either.As the top species, humans require far more resources, and we should be allowed to sacrifice other creatures for the sake of our advancement. However, as the top species, I think we also have a moral duty to make those animals' stay on this planet as pleasant as possible. But that might be too logical for some people.If you're an emotional thinker and want to be shocked and disturbed, watch this. If you'd like to see sound arguments and logical solutions, don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never liked extremism, and that goes both ways.... I believe the point of this documentary is that there should be a balance and above all, animals MUST be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve. I give you the example of Indians or Eskimos, who kill EXACTLY what their needs demand, and the respect they have for their killings and the animals they kill makes them an example to me. So this movie didn't stopped me from eating meat, but going to a circus, wearing fur or leather has been out of the question for a long time... I have no religious beliefs, I believe only in Nature and in a saying: « What goes around comes around».</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What about killing in nature?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Earthlings was captivating and disturbing, i was aware of many of these farming practices however this film put the issue of inhumane farming in the wider context of "species-ism", that is the superiority complex we as humans have over animals. the film shows species-ism in areas i had never considered to be linked to the farming issue, areas such as pets, zoos, and science. Earthlings does a remarkable job in forming a coherent case against our current attitudes towards animals by simply showing our inhumane acts over and over again in a series of increasingly horrific scenes with cruelty perpetrated by humans against animals, culminating for me with the most graphic scene of a wolf who had been skinned alive turning its head and blinking with its only remaining eyelid. this shot truly shocked me. i would however like to pose one question: should we compare our practices to the standards set by humans or to the standards of nature? i ask this because you can turn on any nature program and see animals killing each other in extremely cruel ways. are the film makers saying that because we can control the killing procedure it should be as humane as possible regardless of how the animal would have died in the wild? if so should be also intervene in the wild to stop what we as humans would consider a painful death?</fullReview>

It doesn't really send a clear message about what can be done. It shows you animal cruelty occurring every day, makes you very emotional, but beyond that it offers little in terms of solutions and action. Veganism is hardly an option for the majority of people in this world, so from a practical perspective its a bit of a joke. Yet, the way it addresses the issue is very sincere, heartfelt and everyone will take away something from the movie. If you haven't seen it - you should - it will open your eyes to what our thirst for cheaper and cheaper products and more and more money does do the human soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Earthlings is a frankly unpersuasive propaganda piece in support of the animal rights movement. Heavily promoted by Farm Sanctuary and other animal rights organizations, its strategy is to parade horrors inflicted on animals without placing them in any real context, at times citing events that occurred decades ago or in foreign countries as though they reflected present day America.The film starts off weak by bringing up a series of complex issues that it fails to explore adequately, particularly the equality principle and speciesism. By only briefly mentioning these concepts, it fails to make a persuasive case that we should accept them or the film's argument.The film's presentation of animal abuse is poorly handled, with numerous examples given in quick succession without any real analysis. At times this borders on the intellectually dishonest. For example, the film portrays debeaking of chickens without mentioning that that practice is on the decline. Furthermore, in the discussion of medical experiments on animals, it relies on footage that is clearly decades old, bringing into question whether the images reflect current standard practice.Finally, the film, for all its gory images, is in the end just plain boring. Joaquin Phoenix's narration drones on and on, coming across as preachy and ultimately off-putting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering the popularity of humane animal farming. And the fact that it looks like he chose the worst of the bad venues. This film doesn't seem that relevant any longer. And there isn't much the USA can do about countries that don't follow the same laws as we do. I just can't see how people handle things in 3rd world countries is our fault. It is a given that anyone that owns animals should treat them humanely. I grew up going to my Grandparents farm in California and they always treated their animals fairly. Even when it cam to slaughtering them. So in my opinion this is just a shock film that doesn't really pertain to anyone but poverty stricken countries for the most part or bad slaughter houses that should be controlled by the FDA. They should never have been allowed to develop that way. Albeit that there were some pertinent moments about circus animals, but I don't go to circuses or zoos for that matter. And I have always thought Bull fighting was barbaric. Attention would be better focused on the people of these countries. some of them were in worse situations than the animals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose it's the "serious" face of the documentary that makes people view it as a "must see". Everyone feels like they have to rate it highly because of the sensitive subject, without judging the quality of the film itself. Joaquin Phoenix uses a juxtaposition of irrelevant images, just to cause sensation. Ironically enough, this kind of arbitrary and unfounded comparisons, like the animal slaughterhouses and the holocaust, were the tactics used by Nazis themselves in order to cause sensation (see for example Leni Riefenstahl's cinematography). In no point did I feel that I was being informed about the -otherwise important- topic of animal rights. On the contrary, what I perceived was that the director thought that the message was so important, that he felt entitled to try to brainwash the viewers, without any well founded arguments, just using an empty Nazi-like rhetoric. A lamentable option.</fullReview>

Not because i felt pity or empathy towards animals AFTER watching this documentary (If this can be called one, it was more like a never ending series of animals getting slaughtered right on your face) I gave a 3 only because of the effort of the film maker in collecting all the stuff, but apart from that, it is a continuous torture to the eyes. Unbelievable that there is hardly any story, direction or options, there are shots after shots of gore and blood except turning vegan? I do luv animals as they share our feelings and would not want to get them hurt for human industrialization. The film should have implored more about the urbanization or the real reasons of unhealthy animal slaughter instead of giving me detailed description step by step how they are killed, how the blood is trickled and.......... ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! On the other hand, i would luv to see someone making a film how these average people being normal fathers, mothers, brothers become brutal butchers. Anyway, the film is horrible visually and physically, but if it turned more meat eaters to vegans, it might have reached its purpose although i don't want more PETA hippies pushing more gore videos as best documentaries.</fullReview>

Brain requires a lot of calories.2) is the message "Kill those animals more humanely!"? It is patently impossible to kill all those chicken, cows, and pigs humanely.

It is the equivalent of showing typical human behavior while only filming in a prison or mental hospital. This is not to say change is not necessary. Cruelty is never acceptable, however presenting the problems of animal's mistreatment in this way, would have been best billed as an expose. As for pets and zoo animals, that are well cared for, fare far better than animals in the wild. The "wild" being equally both more cruel and unforgiving an environment for all earthlings as the film suggests humans are towards animals. This film portrays humans as earthlings that are different, superior, civilized and have complete control over the earth and it's inhabitants. All we can really control, is are own actions individually. In the end, no solutions were offered, only visual images of cruelty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly repugnant, offensive, and smug piece of trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Animal abuse is cruel. Cruelty to animals is inhumane, stupid, and weak. It is always weak to hurt the weaker of anyone or anything. Animals are undoubtedly the weaker of the living beings that inhabit the earth. What makes animals such fascinating and full of majestic beauty is that, unlike humans, animals cannot hesitate. They go on instinct, they learn from whatever mistakes they make, and they grow and prosper based on that. That is the philosophy of the beast. If they feel that they have not made a mistake, it is because they haven't. For example, if a cat eats a person's pet bird the owner may be angry with the cat, but the cat still found the bird to be delicious. This is what this documentary, EARTHLINGS, fails to point out. In it's first sixty seconds, it elaborates on the idea that abuse of the weak is inhuman. After the opening minute is over the film takes what it's supposed emphasis is built on, and blows it.Instead of elaborating on what makes animals weak, the film instead takes a shock approach to the material. From the second minute onward, the film takes graphic footage of the holocaust, acts of racism, acts of abuse, acts of rape, acts of pedophilia, and acts of sexism and hatred toward minorities, and then immediately trivializes all of it by juxtaposing it with explicitly violent sequences of animal torture, abuse, and murder. That is where the film lost what it had built on in it's first minute. This is no more a documentary than it is a series of footage intended to outdo all the vicious images of actual violence and murder we see everyday on television and on shockumentaries. The film is more focused on displaying extreme visual situations to pull the viewer's heartstrings in order for the viewer to agree with them. It is exploitative, it is disgusting, and it is completely unethical and dishonest. This film is nothing more than propaganda designed to get people to not eat meat.This is among one of the most disgusting gorefests I have ever seen in my life and I absolutely hated myself for sitting through the entire thing. Not since 'The Passion of the Christ' have I ever felt so disgusted at filmmakers who, rather than challenge or entertain the viewer, decide to depict a celebration of violence and torture and gore and flayed flesh. Instead of making a film about the joy of life and about the joy of animals, they decide to instead just ditch that approach and concentrate on what humans do to animals on a regular basis behind the closed doors at restaurants, at farms, in the comfort of their homes, etc. With a film with a title like EARTHLINGS, you really don't get the sense that the filmmakers even bothered to try and depict any aspect of life in a positive way. Let me just take this time to say that, despite what this shockumentary tells us, the animal kingdom is a million times far more cruel to it's animals than any human could ever even hope to be.I must confess, I spent about sixty of the film's ninety minute runtime with my hands covering my eyes. I have no desire to see actual footage of animals being tracked down, tortured, humiliated, abused, and finally killed. What I saw was far more than enough. I saw more blood and gore in the mere thirty minutes that I did manage to watch than I did in any film I can think of. This film may please those of us out there who yearn to be nauseated by a film and go to the video store to rent shockumentaries such as 'Faces of Death', 'Mondo Cane', or 'Goodbye Uncle Tom'. I can only imagine those people getting any sort of entertainment out of this. For many folks, this film will most definitely have an effect.Most people will admire how the film will show them horrible things they never imagined that they would see. Most people will watch the film, become vegans or vegetarians because of it, and then will either go and join PETA and protest KFC and protest animal/human interaction in all forms, or will proceed to go on with their life and won't change. Either way, the film is going to have an effect. The effect it had on me was utter disgust in the fact that anyone with a reputation and with money can go out and edit hours of animal torture together and call it a documentary when it really is nothing but exploitative propaganda of the lowest form.So in the end EARTHLINGS is, in reality, nothing more than junk. The film was designed to get a reaction. That is all. The film was not made for any audience, which means that it has no purpose for even existing. There is no reason to watch this. If this film makes anyone become a vegetarian, then that's their problem for allowing themselves to be manipulated by dishonesty and propaganda. I love animals. I believe that animals should not be abused. However, I refuse to call them victims. Animals are killed everyday, sometimes in very cruel ways, just as humans and plants are. Life is violent and full of misery and pain. There's nothing anyone can do about that. If you love animals, go watch one of those documentaries like 'Microcosmos', 'Winged Migration', and 'March of the Penguins' and don't waste your time with this junk that only dwells on nothing more than the simple horrors of daily life.</fullReview>
