		<fullReview>How do you film an unfilmable book? Well, you can either make it up as you go along, as David Cronenberg did with Naked Lunch, or you take this approach and make a film about a film crew making a film of an unfilmable book. The tricky tome in question here is The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentlemen - a bawdy work of wit and wonderment penned in 1760 by clergyman Laurence Sterne.Steve Coogan plays Tristram - even though he's not born by the end of the book - as well as Tristram's father Walter... and himself. Or rather, a semi-fictional version of himself. Rob Brydon also stars as himself and Walter's brother - Tristram's Uncle Toby. There are lots of other familiar British TV actors either playing themselves playing other characters or simply playing characters who interact with the stars of the film-within-the-film (for example, Ian Hart plays the screenwriter but doesn't play Ian Hart). And Gillian Anderson makes an appearance. Confused? Don't worry, you won't be.As the writer and director strive to retain the spirit of Shandy compromises have to be made to allow for star egos, historical accuracy (Mark Williams is excellent as a pain-in-the-arse military consultant), and a miniscule budget. In one cracking scene, the crew watch the 'rushes' of the underwhelming battle scene ("Look at that! There are, literally, tens of people..."), leaving the director in despair and the costume designer in tears.The seemingly complicated set-up actually makes a lot of sense, with Coogan sending up the naughty-boy persona created for him by the British press and Brydon sending up Coogan, while the film itself sends up the movie-making process. Viewers will be frequently amused but never bewildered as Michael Winterbottom pulls it all together with panache.Anyone unfamiliar with the novel won't learn much, but it matters not. Bawdy and barmy, A Cock And Bull Story embodies Sterne's work perfectly. Coogan gamely shows his vulnerable side (or maybe that's just good acting?) and shows terrific rapport with Brydon, who steals the show with marvellously mundane banter and spot-on impersonations of Coogan-as-Alan Partridge and Roger Moore. Give that man his own movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it possible to have a hot streak with a Winterbottom?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film so post-post-postmodern that Steve Coogan steps out of the screen and hits on your girlfriend in the theater lobby -- I won't say if this is true or not -- Tristram Shandy is a meticulously controlled work that, despite the film-within-a-film conceit, is very faithful to its impenetrable source. Just like Sterne's book, the engine of Winterbottom's film is bittersweet melancholy, but the engine noise, drowning out what some might consider to be a nihilistic message, is bawdy, music-hall, veddy veddy English humor.For Americans to get anything out of this movie, you will need to understand a bit about both Tristram Shandy -- at least enough to know that Coogan is playing Shandy's FATHER and that Shandy himself is only the narrator -- and about Steve Coogan's mythology. For those who are too lazy, all you need to know is that Coogan doesn't have a reputation for being led around by his brain. I have briefly met him in person and found the experience uncanny. He is so fully what he is that he seems to have a force-field around him that separates him from the more amorphous mass of humanity. In the future, when you say the word "Coogan," it will instantly paint a picture of a certain type of male. A type that women are drawn to irresistibly, because he is both a child in need of mothering, a grown Linus Van Pelt perpetually clutching a security blanket, and aggressively sexual and dirty. He's the bad boy and the baby all rolled into one. And yet, far from being a jerk or a cad, he is intensely likable.All of which goes to show that rarely has any actor been more perfect for a role than Coogan is here. Posing this hapless man-child next to a bull with a huge bazoing pretty much says it all. You see, Sterne is not a fan of the procreative arts ( and judging by his last few movies, neither is Winterbottom; "Everyone's kid is so special," says Samantha Morton in Code 46, "Makes you wonder where all the ordinary adults come from." ) The title character of Tristram Shandy remains famously unborn, and the only characters that Sterne truly loves, and who truly love each other, are a eunuch and a widow, all of which goes to show that Sterne considers death to be a blessing and human existence to be largely unnecessary, nothing but the byproduct of mindless sexual flare-ups that would be quickly forgotten except for the babies they produce, who in turn have more sexual flare-ups, and so on. In the film these flare-ups come courtesy of Steve Coogan, playing both himself as a father -- and constantly attempting to cheat on his wife, as he is famous for doing in real life; you may even recall the false alarm that he'd knocked up Courtney Love! -- and also the reluctant Shandy's paterfamilias. Between these two Johnny Appleseeds, both of whom look like Steve Coogan, entire planetary systems could be populated and repopulated.The film is short, but dense -- every scene has so many dimensions that the end result fans out like a peacock's tail. There are infinite details to sift through in its 90 minute running time, and there is a very beautifully done telescoping of time periods to match Tristram Shandy's 18th-century milieu with that of Steve Coogan's and our own modern day. When Coogan haggles over a script in the lobby of a trendily underlit London hotel, you feel somehow transported back to Shandy's father's palatial home and its elegant candlelight. The central scene of the film comes when Coogan, escaping from a costume party where the 21st century briefly crashes into the 18th, tells his wife: "I just had a nightmare." That nightmare is called our world, reality, human as opposed to divine love, the world controlled by time yet where nothing really changes except the clothes and the hairstyles, and that, despite its obvious wretchedness and pain, people are too afraid to give up; yes, the very same "cock and bull story" of the title. It is not every comedian who has something to say about the human comedy. But Coogan certainly does, under Michael Winterbottom's expert and disillusioned hand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film version of a possibly unfilmable--some might say unreadable--novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this at the New York Film Festival, where it was met with the wild enthusiasm and raucous laughter it so fully deserves.I intentionally avoided reading any reviews before I went, as I was so curious to see how Winterbottom (whose "24-Hour Party People" I had loved) would approach this bear of a book.The film begins with the two stars getting made-up and chatting about the size of their roles and the color of their teeth (the actors, who appeared with Winterbottom in the post-screening Q&amp;A at the festival, assured the audience that this opening scene, as well as their conversation over the end credits, was completely improvised). The scene shifts to Tristram Shandy beginning the narration of his life with an anecdote about Groucho Marx--and proceeds to go wild from there.The cast is made up of some of the finest actors in British television--apart from the two leads, Dylan Moran of "Black Books" and David Walliams of "Little Britain" appear, as well as Stephen Fry, Shirley Henderson, and a host of others, including a splendid turn by Keeley Hawes in a role that consists of little more than labor pains and screaming--and one American: Gillian Anderson in a couple of wonderful scenes, one as herself and the other as the Widow Wadman.As one of the actors observes in the film, Laurence Sterne had written "a post-modern novel before modernism had even been invented," and Winterbottom honors that admirably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filming the Impossible: The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman and its Nods to 8 1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Has anyone ever truly read The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman? Does anyone know what the hell it's supposed to be about? For that matter, does this review have a spoiler? Does it make sense that a scene depicting realism, for that matter, involve a man lodged upside-down in a makeshift womb? I don't know. I've tried to get past the first page of the book but I find that I go into brain-freeze, my thumb seeks solace in my mouth, and I scrunch into a fetal position not unlike Steve Coogan in the movie. I've come to the conclusion that when a work is so far ahead in the future to be rendered the apex of post-modernism, it's probably best to let it alone and have people think you're an intellectual because there it stands in plain view, a book with a handsome cover, in your bookshelf.An unfilmable novel. Hell, an unreadable at that! But here it is, the first critical success of 2006: A COCK AND BULL STORY is the film to crack the shell and open the merry chaos that is Lawrence Sterne's crazy universe. Knowing that this novel is no walk in the park for anyone, Michael Winterbottom comes up with a mockumentary that details the creation of the movie we're watching which itself is about the adaptation of the book. This loop sets the stage for a flurry of events which transpire at a crazy pace parallel to the "events" of the book. Star and co-star clash on who's the bigger star, Tristram's own birth needs more and more takes, and then there's the "minor" issue that Widow Wadman, a major player of the novel, is nowhere to be seen in the screenplay and in walks Gillian Anderson who is cast as the Widow, who's scenes wind up in the cutting-room floor anyway.Parallel to these events are others that mirror the ones in Federico Fellini's 8 1/2. Steve Coogan the actor in the movie is married to wife Jenny who has arrived to be with him during this filming with her infant son (who will play a part in the movie). Their relationship is not as strained as Guido and Luisa Anselmi but they are seen as on the cusp of being estranged. Carla's equivalent is her polar opposite, a film buff who's also part of the production crew, also named Jennie, who like Carla talks on and on about intricate, almost elaborate subtext of symbolisms that Steve succumbs to in one flirtatious scene when she comes on to him. He, like Guido, returns to his wife though, and despite the odds the movie becomes reality -- a very skewered one at best and one that leaves the audience saying, "Huh?" That is the main irony and in borrowing the original music score composed by Nino Rota it grounds A COCK AND BULL STORY in 8 1/2's sense of the absurd that continue even after the credits roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastically funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to see the premiere in North Yorkshire and it was absolutely brilliant!!!Much better and much funnier than I ever expected as I had anticipated quite a complex 'drama' type storyline based on my feeble attempts to read the book. It was fantastic though and I will definitely be getting the DVD. The DVD and it's extras were mentioned a lot, but nothing was said about it being released at the cinema...so I don't know if that's still happening? I was extremely surprised by the whole thing actually, as I have tried several times to read the book and I just don't understand it...so was expecting to not understand the film either, but it was great...it did jump around a bit, but he told you when he was getting ahead of himself so you always knew where you were and it was easy to follow.The blank page was discussed when they were talking about how to make the film longer...and they showed a blank screen for a few moments before deciding that the audience wouldn't find it that interesting...it was then that they decided that they would include the Widow Wadman scenes and talked about who should play her.Rob Brydon then had quite a funny scene with Steve Coogan saying that he couldn't possibly do the love scenes with Gillian Anderson as he has posters of her and owns the entire XF collection and she is his absolute complete ideal woman and how he has sexual feelings for her which I found rather funny.So yeah, it was incredibly funny! I have never laughed that much at a film in my entire life. The funniest parts were between Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon as themselves, and as Michael Winterbottom told us in the Q+A afterwards, they were pretty much ad-libbed. Also liked the scene in the barn where they lowered Steve Coogan upside down into massive fake womb...and then proceeded to have an argument with him about how realistic it was! :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could it have been done any better? probably not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In trying to film a movie based on the novel Tristam Shandy, it is explained that this book is utterly unfilmable. modestly rather, they show the actual process of trying to make this movie while discussing the parts of the book that displayed meaning so they can decide what scenes will be added/cut in the movie. Cleverly enough, this entire process serves as a metaphor for the actual book and the digressive nature of it. Maybe not the most interesting topic to watch, but it is done well enough for you to be curious as to how everything is resolved. If you don't get the metaphor, you will not like the movie. If you do, you might be as delighted as ever that something quite unique has just been viewed.didn't i just sound ridiculous?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the funniest and strangest films about the film-making process, this is less an adaptation of the novel, more a focused and hilarious deconstruction on Winterbottom's working methods. Coogan and Brydon are fantastic. The scene with Coogan and a hot chestnut down his trousers is worth the price of admission alone! Although the film may not be to everyone's taste - it darts around and has little respect for narrative logic or continuity (as does the book), it is a freeform little gem that really does cement Winterbottom's reputation as the most exciting British director out there. Any person who can make In This World, Code 46, 9 Songs and then this in a row is worthy of respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfilmable book according to Michael Winterbottom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tristram Shandy, the complex novel, by Laurence Sterne, comes to the screen thanks to the adaptation and direction of Micahel Winterbottom, a man that likes to take risks. The idea of mixing the goings on of a film being made based on the novel, and the people behind the project presents some original ideas about what goes on behind the scenes.This film within a film, showcases the talents of Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon, two funny English comedians that haven't been seen much on this side of the Atlantic, but who are quite well known in the U.K.The Sterne novel is just a pretext for making sense of the book, which presents tremendous challenge to the movie makers. On the one level we see the story of the birth of the hero of the novel, and on the other, we watch a somewhat conceited actor going through the process of the filming as he and the company socialize in a posh hotel.The basic premise of the film presents a problem with American audiences drawn to the film by the good notices it received from the local critics. Judging the reaction of the audience the other day at the Angelika, one wonders if the film was understood as almost no laughter could be heard in response to some of the clever and funny things happening on the screen. In fact, it seems baffling to this viewer the response of what appeared to be an audience of mostly cool NYU students.What Mr. Winterbottom gets is excellent acting from most of this multi talented cast. Steve Coogan, with his deadpan delivery, and Rob Brydon, his sidekick, come out as the winners. Their timing is impeccable and their chemistry is real. Some of the other people in the cast include Shirley Henderson, Stephen Fry, Kelly MacDonald, Ian Hart, Jeremy Northam, Naomie Harris, Gillian Anderson and some other talented English actors, too many to mention all.The excellent musical score by Michael Nyman enhances all what we are watching. Marcel Zyskind's cinematography gives the right look to the film. Ultimately, all credit for making the film the fun it is goes to Michael Winterbottom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best literature adaptation in ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Smart, funny, original. I just saw this at the Toronto Film Festival tonight, and was really impressed. Great and hilarious performances, especially by Steve Coogan, who is SO funny. But Rob Brydon is almost as great, and the two of them have a great rapport. The film really captures the anarchistic spirit of the book. Hard to imagine that anyone could come up with an idea to bring this unusual book to the screen, and Michael Winterbottom hasn't been the most consistent of directors lately (or ever, really) but this is a winner. The story is told in several layers: a film is being made of the novel "Tristram Shandy", starring Steve Coogan as both Tristram and his father Walter Shandy, but the behind the scenes drama of the making of the film is an important component. And lots of parallels with the various players real lives (Steve Coogan and lap dancers, etc.) Incredibly clever. Definitely check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of Cleverness and some Wit but -- I do fear -- not quite enough Shandy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Winterbottom's movie is an Altmanesque production depicting an English crew shooting Laurence's Sterne's eccentric eighteenth-century literary classic. It begins wittily and appropriately with Steve Coogan exchanging mocking banter with costar Rob Bryden, and then Coogan, with cosmetically enlarged and crooked nose and proper costume, becomes Shandy introducing himself. The essentials of the book are sketched in -- first of all, Tristram's meandering account of his childhood and birth (not in any logical order -- nor should they be -- and intersperced with Coogan's caustic comments on the child actors playing him at earlier stages -- which perfectly fits in with Sterne's tendency to interrupt himself on the slightest pretext); then, Uncle Toby (Rob Briden) and his obsession with his exploits at the Battle of Naumur, which include an injury whose location he studiously avoids explicating. The mishaps surrounding Tristram's birth start with his name and move on to the forceps -- then a new device -- whose clumsy use by Dr. Slop cause the altered nose. A falling window caused even more crucial damage. The moment of birth is dwelt upon -- then the camera cuts back to the crew and the focus shifts to the Coogan-Bryden rivalry again, Steve's girlfriend and their baby, his own problems in bed, his flirtation with a pale-coffee-colored lady crew member who's a great film buff. Coogan wants his shoes made with higher heels so he's taller than Bryden. The filmmakers hold endless confabs over how to do a battle scene and whether to bring in the romance with Widow Wadham (to be played by Gillian Anderson, who agrees from Los Angeles with comic alacrity). Anderson's presence brings in more money for the battle, and then both the battle and the romance are left out of the final cut. Much hilarity accompanies these details, though the main focus is on Coogan's stardom and inability to have a minute to himself. Unfortunately once Winterbottom pulls away from the birth scene, the Sterne novel, which pretty much ranks with Fielding's "Tom Jones" for brilliance and humor, somewhat falls by the wayside never to be recovered till just before the end, when it seems tacked back in as a hasty afterthought. And hasty is one thing Sterne never is: impulsive and quirky, but never, never, never -- oh, my Heavens No! -- not rushed. At novel's end, his main character, after all, has still not been born. Maybe it means something that only one member of the cast is reported to have ever actually read "Tristram Shandy" through to the end. Neither Coogan nor Bryden seems particularly eighteenth-century in their role, and Bryden's isn't a particularly inspired recreation of Uncle Toby. Nobody is amiably eccentric to the right degree. Winterbottom has made an intermittently quite funny movie that never loses its pace, but he has recreated Robert Altman rather than Laurence Sterne, and when you realize this, if you care at all about the novel, the whole enterprise, despite its frantic energy, becomes, for all its wit and good humor, a little bit of a drag. This is an enormously clever film, but what seems brilliant on paper doesn't always play for keeps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Messy and a bit too post-modern and smart-arsed for some I'm sure but for me it was just a great deal of fun and a lot of laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before getting on to what I thought of the film, let's just get some of the big problems out in the open. Firstly those looking for an adaptation of the book will be disappointed to find that very little of the content is on the screen because the script uses it more as a frame and a guide for essentially a behind-the-scenes mockumentary about making the film of the book. It does go someway to backing up the claim that the book is "unfilmable" because this film certainly hasn't managed it. Secondly, by being all post-modern and having actors playing a version of themselves the film will alienate viewers who don't get it and feel that it is all too clever for its own good; likewise it may have people feeling that it has all been done before ? indeed by the very same people in fact.However, that said, it is hard for me to ignore the fact that it was tremendous fun. Taking its lead from the novel's constant digressions, the film cannot stick on anything long and as we open the film jumping around the events around Tristram's birth, we soon find that we have jumped behind the scenes and into the lives of those involved. It is a brave move and one that doesn't totally work but it is surprisingly easy to go along with. In terms of the treatment of the novel I felt it did well because it made me want to read the book. We are told enough about the novel to develop an interest in it and know what it is about and it may be a very wise decision to have avoided tackling something that everyone says couldn't be done. Some parts of the book are told as they would have been in a "proper" filmed version but some are not ? one scene is actually Coogan's nightmare and features Brydon playing his big scene with Gillian Anderson with a Roger Moore impression.In the place of a straight adaptation what we get is a wonderfully funny look at stars, period dramas, British film-making, celebrities and so on. It has very little structure to speak of but what it does have is a natural development, humour and delivery that makes it interesting and constantly fresh. I wasn't laughing every second because it isn't that type of comedy but occasionally it was very funny, producing some great scenes and some great dry wit. The "story" (if there is one) focuses on Coogan ? his pedantic fame, his exploits and generally the exaggerated version of himself that he has played before. This keeps the film moving forward by providing one central point of reference for everything else to happen around so, although it does feel very fragmented and distracted, really it is more structured than it appears. The most amusing moments do come from the post-modern looks at Coogan's insecurities, the contrast of his family life with the exploits with the stripper etc and generally it makes the film interesting because it does convince as a "reality" of a sort. Having said that though, the film does have some hysterical bits that just hang there by themselves; for example Brydon's Coogan impressions are hilarious, as is the Al Pacino discussion over the end credits.The cast list reads like a who's who of British film and television ? some in main roles but many in semi-cameos who do the goods and then move on. Coogan is naturally the star (no matter what Brydon thinks!) and, although he has played a version of himself or addressed the camera in a post-modern way before, it still works well here. He is convincing and natural and it helps the film produce this "reality" that it really does heavily rely on. Brydon perhaps relies a bit too heavily on impressions but generally he is just as good and the scenes he shares with Coogan tend to be some of the funniest. Although she has largely been overlooked as the critics name names and hand out praise, I think that Naomi Harris deserves a lot of credit for her performance here. Left with a more serious thread to carry, she turns in a totally convincing performance to the point where I could easily believe this is who she is. She also produces an engaging thread around her desire for Coogan, despite having little to work with. I'll admit that I have liked her in most things I have seen her do, find her very attractive and did slightly fall for her "chilled, cool dressing film buff" character (ok, a bit more than slightly) but I still thought she was easily the best performance in the whole film.The rest of the cast work well within the "reality" of the film and generally produce laughs. Faces like Moran, Fry and Walliams provide some comedy but are little more than cameos. Northam and Anderson are good and support is generally very good from people like Macdonald, Hart, Henderson and others. Winterbottom pulls off the seemingly impossible of holding it all together as director and moving well within the novel and reality ? both in terms of story telling but also visually.Overall this will please as many people as it p*sses off I think. Taking the manner of telling of the novel (distracted and digressing) the film moves from a straight telling into a spoof of reality. Saying it like this sounds dull and "seen it all before" but it is an impressive piece of film-making that is brave and, even better, works. As brilliant as it is flawed, this is certainly worth a try whether you know the book or not because, simply put, it is tremendous, tumultuous fun.</fullReview>

By far the greatest bit was the piece about acting techniques. Steve Coogan at first imagines what hot (as in temperature) walnuts- or some type of nut-would feel like dropped down his trousers and caught next to his genitals. He tries many interpretations but the one that slayed the audience was when he actually dropped the "hot nuts" into his trousers in order to see how close his interpretation came to the actual reaction. it was uproariously entertaining. i was wondering if winterbottom and gilliam have ever thought to produce something together? please sir may we have some more?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, but far too many in-jokes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS The unfilmable novel. There are so many books out there that are so mammoth, there's no way it can ever be filmed. Always forced to miss events out, unable to capture the emotions, there's loads of reasons why particular books can't be turned into cinema. Still, that's no reason not to try.Rather than trying to actually film the actual book of "Tristram Shandy", director Michael Winterbottom has hit upon a superb idea. Turning the trial of the filming into a film in it's own right, Winterbottom has created a fun piece of entertainment. At the same time however, as a result of the participation of Steve Coogan, far too many jokes are a direct reference to his former comic hit Alan Partridge. This in itself is a direct stab at how people perceive him, but it's only really needed once, not however multiple times we get it.Michael Winterbottom (Jeremy Northam) is filming the unfilmable. Hiring Steve Coogan to play Tristrum Shandy and Rob Brydon as Captain Toby Shandy, he's gathered two great actors to play two great roles. How much of the film actually needs to be made though, and is it really that possible? From the offset, you can tell the film is going to be funny. Thanks to the magnificent pairing of Coogan and Brydon, you've fallen off your chair in laughter five times before the film has even properly began. It's a daft affair and that partnership really drives the story perfectly.That is, the film would be hilarious if we could get past Alan Partridge. The Coogan character of many years, for so much of the film we are constantly given Rob Brydon's impression. The first time we hear it, there is a knowing laugh. After multiple times though, and the joke begins to get lame. It's a repetitive joke, and even for those in the know, it gets incredibly tiresome.Still, aside from the in-jokes, the film can be funny for long periods. Aiding Coogan, Brydon and Northam are the best of British comedy. Ronni Ancona, Keeley Hawes, Dylan Moran, Shirley Henderson and David Walliams, the list goes on. Add to the magnificent list a brief appearance by Gillian Anderson (and thus a few "X-Files" jokes) and you know the story is going to be good.Often funny, but perhaps too focused on the repetitive poke at cast history, "Tristram Shandy" is a clever enough film. It'll keep the audience entertained, and it'll leave you with a smile on your face. That's all you need really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please read the book, don't bother with this smug, shallow film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw A Cock &amp; Bull Story at the London Film Festival last year. The film should do well: it's been very heavily publicised, has well-known comedy actors in it, and - when I saw it - the packed house loved it. The film is enjoyable primarily because of Steve Coogan's and Rob Brydon's seemingly ad-libbed comedy, but as a version of - or even tribute to - Sterne's Tristram Shandy it fails miserably. The film barely grasps the character of this (anti-) novel at all. I blame director Michael Winterbottom for this. The book's tangential narratives are too briefly handled in the first half to leave the viewer with any real sense of Tristram's gargantuan project. The film's first half races along at breakneck pace, presumably to suggest a mad-cap hilarious confusion to Tristram's narrative - but all I was left with was the feeling that the director was terrified Joe Public might be bored by the boring old eighteenth century. The all-too-jaunty pace suggests a lack of faith in the novel's comedy and a lack of faith in the viewer's intelligence. Tristram Shandy is a very funny book and the humour is evident without such forced jauntiness. Sterne is a notably playful and generous novelist, he loves his readers and never displays a lack of faith in them. The film's lack of faith, in itself as well as in its audience, is also evident in its rendering of the famous black page - discussed by director, writer and actors as to whether it is possible to put the trope of a black page into a film at all. Suddenly the screen goes black! ... but the soundtrack remains and the discussion continues, for five seconds before the audience is reassuringly given back the visuals again. If Winterbottom had Sterne's resolve and experimental touch he would have kept the screen black without sound for, say, fifteen seconds. Making your audience uncomfortable doesn't mean you don't respect them! And what of the actual discussion of the viability of putting the black page in the film? A more courageous experimental film/director wouldn't have flinched from doing it, let alone chat about it in an oh-so funny way. Can you imagine Godard having such qualms? The other big problem with this film is its film-within-a-film conceit. It's all about the impossibility of getting a film made and of faithfully rendering Tristram Shandy, which itself is about the impossibility of faithfully rendering the complexity of life - geddit? If you don't, Stephen Fry is on hand to explain this to you in the manner of a patient uncle at the end of the film. Not only is this a wretched simplification of the book's theme about art and artifice but this theme is itself just one amongst many themes in the book. Tristram Shandy handles these themes with humour and experimental elan but A Cock &amp; Bull Story sticks rigidly to its one theme, wearily restating it again and again (rather than going any deeper) in a way that is more listless than joyfully experimental. What follows on screen is a sort of comedy soap-opera of the prurience that is wrapped up with celebrity (something that has nothing to do with the novel). Some of this soap-opera is indeed very funny, but not as funny as, say, Marion &amp; Geoff or Alan Partridge. If Winterbottom had tried to stick to the novel - a truly courageous and difficult undertaking - instead of heading into the usual fundament-gazing about media and celebrity that masquerades as analysis and filmic experimentation then A Cock &amp; Bull Story would have been wonderful. As it is, the film is rather like what Steve Coogan, put on the spot by Tony Wilson, says about the novel: 'I suppose it's kind of ... a postmodern masterpiece before, er, there was any modern to be post about.' A nice joke, but one that resounds hollow when applied to the film itself. In other words, the film is generally a load of Bull: read the book instead! Corporal Trim</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not For The Scary Movie-Style Crowd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty tough review to write, mainly because this film definitely won't be for the general population. If you like potty humor and in-your-face laughs, avoid this movie. TRISTRAM SHANDY is a thinking man's comedy, with jokes inside jokes inside jokes.For those who aren't familiar with the title (THE LIFE AND OPINIONS OF TRISTRAM SHANDY, GENTLEMAN), this is in reference to the 18th century literary paperweight composing nine volumes written by Laurence Sterne (famous author John Updike has been quoted as saying, "It's the one novel I want to read before I die"). Considered a "comedy ahead of its time," it caught on quickly with the upper class and became quite a success. But as times changed so did the literary climate, and now the volumes are seen as ...well ...voluminous. Attempting to make a coherent film out of something so incoherently nonlinear certainly would present a challenge, too, so I was quite surprised to see that the books had been translated to the silver screen.Or so I thought...The amazing thing about this movie is that it did something completely unexpected: it stayed true to Laurence Sterne's style (being possibly the first example of "stream of consciousness" writing) but did so by not attempting to tell the story of Tristram Shandy at all. I found this to be one of the funniest aspects of the movie. I could picture the directors and producers in a room talking about the impossibility of turning the books into film and then someone saying, "Hey, why don't we not even try?" So, in the spirit of its original author, that's exactly what these film makers did.The story starts out with a film maker (Steve Coogan, director) trying to tell the story of Tristram Shandy while living a life within the movie itself. Basically, it's the story of a man trying to make a film about a film within a film. It can seem somewhat confusing as the audience is ripped through scenes, unsure of where and ? most importantly ? when they are. To try and tell you how the movie flows would be absolutely impossible, because it has no flow ...and yet it does. The laughs are surprising and often hidden, so a watcher might have to view it several times before connecting with all of the gags (the only exception being when they try to show how funny the film's going to be by dropping a hot chestnut down a man's pants ...seeing that might be worth the price of admission for some).I was surprisingly riveted to the screen throughout the movie, worried that I might miss something (Is the battle scene over? Will it be in the film they're trying to make? Will there be a love scene with Gillian Anderson?).I think this film might get panned by quite a few professional reviewers because it is so different than anything we're used to as movie-goers. But the high comedy can't be denied. It's sheer genius how it all came together (and watch for the running joke on poor British dental hygiene throughout the film).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so it might not be one of the worst films I've ever seen. But that doesn't mean i have to like it. I'm a fan of Steve Coogan and have been for years, but this film was absolute rubbish. I watch many films, sometimes 3 a day, and this is one of the few times i had to consider switching off before the end (like Ultraviolet and HP-Goblet of Fire).Granted, there are several funny scenes, and granted its based on a book.BUT FOR GODS SAKE, why would you make a film this boring ? I'm not sure if its the editing (done in the style of the book) but i would happily agree, that "Tristram shandy" is indeed, impossible to make into a film, so why would they bother ? All i saw was Coogan and Brydon making mediocre jokes (sometimes doing the same joke to death in one scene) and supporting cast with no real characters in, apart from Mark Williams of the Fast Show as a detail-mad Historian.Maybe Coogan should hang up his traffic cone ? Only funny bits for me were Brydons impressions of Coogan, and Pacino, and the Hot Chestnut incident. But they are not enough to save this crap film. Finally, after reading other reviews, id like to add, Anyone who berates the viewers intelligence for disliking this film, or blames it on the fact they haven't read the book, is a pretentious moron who obviously thinks too highly of themselves, even those with the lowest IQ should be able to appreciate a moving picture.Avoid it like the plague.</fullReview>

Therefore my friends and i decided to watch this film instead of Fun With Dick and Jane. We certainly regret that decision. Don't get me wrong, this film isn't completely terrible. There are some parts which are very funny, for example, when Steve Coogan gets a hot chestnut down his pants, or when he was a child and there was that 'window incident'. Now, i believe that Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon are both comic genius', however this movie does not show this. I would not recommend this to a friend or anyone really.

		<shortDescription>a highly witty look at the world of the reality of film-making and filming a version of reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tristam Shandy: A Cock &amp; Bull Story, is one of the better movies I've seen in recent memory about the mix of filming the reality of a period piece. Actually, it's a hilarious piece, with director Michael Winterbottom and star Steve Coogan at the top of their games, and in a movie within a movie no less. At first, one might scoff at the idea of their being a movie about a movie of the novel Tristam Shandy, as it's such a prestigious book, but it works because of the filmmaker's abandon with the material; it practically becomes a master's class in what to do with the reality of British humor on a situation. Coogan knows when it's right to play the card of the 'oh, I didn't know that was happening' hand, and Winterbottom knows very well how to interject the Fellini 8 1/2 style into a novel that is, according to all other accounts, practically un-filmable. This challenge ends up making it one of the more delightfully done films about the "art" of movie-making. Bottom line, Tristam Shandy is a period novel set in the 19th century where war and birthright is made paramount in a world of British aristocracy, and where that first gets lampooned (with Coogan and his co-horts sitting back as his 'wife' gives birth to what is really his character as well, with a very cooked nose) what follows that is a deconstruction of how to adapt a book into a film and how that becomes almost as interesting as the book they were originally basing it on.Now, this ends up sort of making the film clever more by half, but not quite. There's a lot about this that the filmmakers intentionally take from other movies while commenting on the very real process of making movies, where 8 1/2 music fits in very well alongside selections from Fanny &amp; Alexander and Barry Lyndon. Coogan becomes a character unto himself, as he did in Coffee &amp; Cigarettes, as does his lovestruck assistant who is attached to foreign films, and there's even a very touching scene where Coogan, in "real" life changes a baby's diapers and takes care of it for a moment. Life mirrors the ridiculousness of the film's absurd self-reflection, however, as Coogan (in one of the funniest moments I've seen in recent memory) has to prepare to climb inside of a fake womb meant for the production ("I'm climbing inside of a womb", he says I think). But meanwhile, the actual adaptation tried to wedge in room, so to speak, into the film about the film itself. So, Tristam Shandy ends up, like it or not fans-of-the-book, as a reflexive take on what it is to adapt something, to really get under the heels of a work in film-making and attempt it, and even come close, but that what goes on behind the scenes probably has an equal level of interest as the actual material does itself.Watch for the in-jokes and other movie references, including a drop-dead funny end credit sequence with Coogan imitating Pacino, and a one little scene involving a certain object when Coogan tried out a "nut" right near his genitals. It's extremely sharp film-making, and one of the better films of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy was published in the mid 1750s and can be described as post modern before the term was invented. Its a ramble and regarded as unfilmable.Enter Frank Cotterell Boyce and Michael Winterbottom assisted by Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan who adapt the book as a film within a film of the book.Anyone familiar with the BBC series The Trip also directed by Winterbottom and starring Brydon and Coogan as versions of themselves will be familiar with the set up. The both tease, spar, cajole each other and do impressions.You have scenes relating to the birth of Tristram Shandy and some of its comical and amusing, you have a battle scene with literally tens of people and suddenly the filmmakers manage to get Gillian Anderson on board as Widow Wadnam which leads to an increased budgetAs the film goes on, Coogan's personal life comes under scrutiny with a newspaper hack chasing him about a kiss and tell story, Madchester TV stalwart and music mogul Tony Wilson appears as himself giving a testy interview to Coogan and the Stephen Fry drops by as a know it all.Of course by the latter end the film just fizzles out, as if the actual writer and director ran out of gas and this viewer lost interest. Maybe there was a good reason why the novel was unfilmable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film-making as controlled chaos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie about a film crew with some people ostensibly playing themselves who are trying to film the virtually unfilmable 18th century novel, Lawrence Sterne's "Tristram Shandy. Just to confuse things further, there's a BBC documentary team in there somewhere making a doco about the production. I suppose you could describe it as a semi-mockumentary, but some of the elements are decidedly fictional. I don't think, for instance that Steve Coogan was ever hunted by the British tabloids after an encounter with a lap-dancer on location, nor did he kiss Jennie the runner (and Fassbinder bluff) while his wife was feeding their baby upstairs. Nor for that matter did Jennie then go off with Steve's verbal jousting partner Rob Brydon.Much of the screen time is occupied by the rivalry between Steve and Rob, who both seem to have a good measure of thespian insecurity. They worry about who has the bigger part, top billing, who looks taller, and who is really the star. Rob worries about a gap in his teeth, Steve about his false nose and whether the child actors playing the young Tristram are upstaging him (one of them certainly has little respect for Steve). But perhaps the lasting impression you get is the semi-controlled chaos of film production. One thinks of the director as being in charge, but the scriptwriters are on hand to protect their creation, the producers, chewing their fingernails about money, are interfering, the guys providing the 18th century battle re-creations have ideas, usually decidedly non-cinematic, of their own, not to mention the weather.Out of this chaos about 30 minutes of "Tristram Shandy" emerges which actually does manage to at least give the flavour of a 500+ page collection of rambling reminiscences and asides, with most attention being paid to Tristram's birth, which seems to have been as chaotic as the production of the film. Keely Hawes as Tristram's mother must get a mention for her full throated portrayal of a woman in labour.Michael Winterbottom, who does not appear but is impersonated by the suave Jeremy Northam (not looking so suave here) is a directorial chameleon, having made an absurdly wide range of films. He seems to have been inspired by Francoise Truffaut's great film about the process of film-making, "Day for Night" but he has done so in a completely different way, using the mockumentary format, but at the same time actually producing a film about the ostensible subject. Perhaps the prime audience for this is film buffs, but the gladiatorial verbal combat between Steve and Rob is alone worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, how post-modern, darling...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The publicity and acclaim for this film circles round the notion that director Michael Winterbottom is filming an 'unfilmable' novel (Sterne's 'Tristram Shandy'), making a witty post-modern exercise in cleverness with in-jokes, references to other films and echoes of other films about the making of films (Fellini's 8 1/2), inane comic banter, etc. But, for me, that that smacks of defensiveness and self-justification, a worry that the way this book has been approached is something that might have sounded good in practise, but doesn't work well in theory because it is too flimsy a way of working, too narrow a view of what the book is about to construct an entire film around. I'll expand: in fact, the first 20 minutes or so make a decent stab of filming the book, switching backwards and forwards in time (breaking the linear narrative structure that most films tend to use in a far more complicated way than the flashbacks you sometimes get), having Steve Coogan (as Tristram) give direct to camera addresses as he narrates the story of his character's life, and with different actors playing the same characters (Coogan, as Tristram, announces that he is also going to play his father, as there is a 'family resemblance' - a nice touch whereby he acknowledges that he is acting but remains 'in character') - certainly not that conventional, but not as irrelevant as the rest of the film, which comes across a bit like an episode of Ricky Gervais' TV series 'Extras' without the sharp social observation and cringe-worthy brilliance. The problems start when, without warning, in a pregnancy scene, we suddenly hear 'Cut' and see the film crew, whereupon we are rushed backstage as Coogan, now playing himself, goes to various meetings, doesn't have sex with his girlfriend, deals with a journalist who knows that he DID have sex with a pole-dancer (this a particularly puzzling incident, treated in a surprisingly casual way), cracks jokes with co-star Rob Brydon, complains about his costume, and so on, ad infinitum. We see Coogan and and Brydon sitting in a viewing theatre, along with various other people involved with the film's making, commenting on the rushes of the film they're making ("that battle looks like it's been filmed with about 10 men") - of course, this is a scene which is actually in the film we're watching - oh how clever and postmodern... - such touches abound. It's all very obvious, and must have sounded good in theory - "we'll echo the dislocation of the book by making a dislocated film", but it really doesn't work in practise. In one scene, Coogan is being interviewed about the film he is making:Tony Wilson: Why "Tristram Shandy"? This is the book that many people said is unfilmable. Steve Coogan: I think that's the attraction. "Tristram Shandy" was a post-modern classic written before there was any modernism to be post about. So it was way ahead of its time and, in fact, for those who haven't heard of it, it was actually listed as number eight on the Observer's top 100 books of all time. Tony Wilson: That was a *chronological* list. The problem with this is that we're not sure how seriously to take it. Is the joke, poking fun at Coogan's lack of knowledge of the project he's at work on, merely there for a laugh? Is Winterbottom making his points through interviewer Wilson's mouth (in which case, wow. Yes we know it's ahead-of-its-time, but is there any intrinsic value in that?) Is it a comment on the way we try to categorise and pigeonhole 'greatness'? Such ambiguity characterises much of the film - nothing wrong with ambiguity, but it helps if it has a discernible purpose (even if that purpose has to be dug out carefully, with an intellectual scalpel). To me, what we have is ultimately the sight and sound (oh! film-related reference! did you notice?) of a smug and self-satisfied director making yet another in-joke to be trendy and post-modern about being trendy and post-modern...This impressions is exacerbated by the glimpses we get of what they're filming (a battle scene, Stephen Fry as Parson Yorrick, Coogan as Tristram suspended in a giant womb), which suggest that it would have been a much more satisfying viewing experience to make 'the film of the book' rather than the faked behind-the-scenes/acted film masquerading as documentary of the making of the film of the book...So, to sum up. The plot summary here on IMDb says this: "interruptions are constant. Scenes are shot, re-shot, and discarded. The purpose of the project is elusive. Fathers and sons; men and women; cocks and bulls. Life is amorphous, too full and too rich to be captured in one narrative." This last sentence is roughly what Stephen Fry says when he suddenly pops up to explain what the novel is 'about'. It's a bizarre moment - almost as if Winterbottom is worried the audience won't 'get' what he's doing, so he's trying to smooth their brows and reassure them that there's a point to all this. But I'm not convinced it needed to be done this way - for me, all the behind-the-scenes ramblings doesn't really get us anywhere. The book was packed with incident and character - this has a fair amount of incident, but few very interesting characters (especially as we know that Coogan and Brydon are playing fairly unsympathetic versions of themselves and are thus 'not really like that'), and if all it's there for is to say, if it can condense the whole book into just the one idea - that life is too full to be captured in one narrative - then I'm not convinced it's worth doing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Winterbottom has a smart idea on his hands, but doesn't have a clue how to make it work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story review by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comrating: 2 out of 4Director: Michael Winterbottom Cast: Steve Coogan, Rob Brydon, Kelly Macdonald Screenplay: Frank Cottrell Boyce MPAA Classification: R (language and sexual content)Michael Winterbottom is in the business of brilliance. He hops about the lilly pads of every genre, continually attempting to innovate how we view the cinema. With his latest outing, Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story, Winterbottom tries desperately to bridge a character through two stories. His goal, as simple as it may initially seem, is to translate Laurence Sterne's 1759 novel, The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, a book infamously named "the unfilmable book". And if there's anything clear about this film at all, it's that whoever mentioned the book to be unfilmable was assuredly correct. The film opens in the make-up department, with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon playing themselves before heading out to the Tristram Shandy set, remarking on the discoloration of Brydon's teeth. We then cut to the actual Tristram Shandy film, with Tristram, also played by Coogan, walking about explaining the film's title. We then flip back to the set, where Coogan's juggling a strained relationship with his wife Jenny (Kelly Macdonald) and another Jennie (Naomie Harris), who works as his assistant. The film continues like this, flipping back and forth between movie and set, ignoring any attempt to form a linear narrative. Winterbottom's challenge is to blend Coogan's on and offscreen character into the same Tristram Shandy; to blend Sterne's novel across the set of the film, and the actual film. Confusing, isn't it? Well, it's actually not that confusing in reality. It's just annoying. Winterbottom has a smart idea on his hands, but doesn't have a clue how to make it work. The film comes across scatterbrained and ridiculous, without direction or a care in the world. It's random in its narrative and fails to bridge the gap between mock-umentary and straight-cut adaptation. It seems to be stuck in second gear, without any interest to shift up or down. That said, second gear isn't the worst of places for a film to be. Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan are both worthy entertainers and each have enough precision with their comic timing to keep the audience smiling. Coogan reprises his role from Coffee &amp; Cigarettes (where he also played himself), arrogantly striding about and taking advantage of his celebrity status. The relationships Coogan deals with throughout the film thankfully take an air of realism. He's often stuck between playing a dad, a lover, and an actor. He deals with each poorly and the consequences are skillfully handled by screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce. And although the film is fragmented and frankly irrelevant, Boyce's dialogue is never indulgent and rings true with crispy clean comic clarity (oh the alliteration!).Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story is, in truth, a difficult film for a critic. There's talent behind the pen of the writer, and talent behind the camera, and talent also in the actors' performances. But it's as though all these talents failed to agree on the proposed outcome. The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy is not adapted here. There are only remnants of that work, and fragments of dozens of other works scattered about the film's 94 minute running length. We can laugh at times and feel the sting of pathos in moments of the romance, but when looked at from afar, Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story is an ocean that was divvied up into a thousand little puddles, none of which wanting to have anything to do with the other. -www.samseescinema.com</fullReview>

I like the opening scene with the two men bantering. The idea of a film within a film can be loads of fun. Somehow, I can't find the humor in this. Steve Coogan as a fetus should be hilarious but I found it a little disturbing. Steve nails it on the head when he asks why the camera couldn't be turned upside down. The logic inside me thought the uterus could be placed horizontally. This should be funny but maybe I was having a bad day.</fullReview>

In the TV series, of course, much of the kidding between Brydon and Coogan has been enjoyed in a much more distilled form. Here there is the, not uninteresting, business of the making of a film and telling something of the Tristam Shandy story. But there seems too much of Coogan worrying about his height in relation to his old pal and far, far too many babies. Being born and crying, babies everywhere plus the excruciating stuff with Coogan in the womb. I may have enjoyed this more without having seen the TV but it seems to me this is a very brave effort to do something very ambitious with limited resources and the two main guys just itching to get it down to simply something involving the two of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steve Coogan doing Al Pacino is worth the price of admission</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts in the makeup trailer with 3 mins of Steve Coogan listening (annoyed) to Rob Brydon talk about the color of his own teeth. "Actually it's a nice colour. You can decorate a child's nursery in this colour. Quite soothing." Done with impeccably awkward timing and proper British tongue-in-cheek cheekiness, you'll either love it or hate it from the start. The rest of the film is equally bizarre, and while it may have little to do with the story of the book it's loosely based on, "Tristram Shandy" captures the same delightfully comical theme of polite chaos.If you're a fan of Christopher Guest ("This is Spinal Tap", "Waiting for Guffman", "For Your Consideration"), this will be right up your alley. "Tristram Shandy" is presented almost like a mockumentary following the backstage drama of a bunch of oddball characters trying to film a low-budget film based on an 18th century novel. Sound confusing? It is. But that's the point of the book: no matter how well you plan something, life's randomness will always win. Steve Coogan reprises the role he has played many times: an egotistical yet lovable loser who is unsuccessfully trying to assert his greatness. But no matter how hard he tries to steal the show, his nemesis Rob Brydon seems to get all the laughs &amp; attention.Fans of British cinema &amp; TV will recognize lots of familiar faces popping in &amp; out (and a hilarious scene with American actress Gillian Anderson from the X-Files). But even if you don't know who these people are, you'll have a good time.This is definitely not a madcap comedy. The humor is very low-key and subtle, even more subtle than the aforementioned Christopher Guest films. If you like to enjoy your films on a deeper level, there's actually quite a bit of structure and intelligence behind it all. In that respect it reminded me of Charlie Kaufman's confusing masterpiece "Synecdoche NY" (an oddball comedy about a about a man getting lost in the task of writing a play about himself) and the equally unconventional musical "De-Lovely" (about Cole Porter watching a biopic about himself)."Tristram Shandy" is not for those who want fast paced laughs &amp; punchline zingers, but if you enjoy real-life comedy, don't miss this. And stick around as the credits roll... as I said in my title, Steve Coogan &amp; Rob Brydon arguing over who does a better Al Pacino is PRICELESS!!!</fullReview>

From what I understand, the book is ostensibly Tristram's autobiography, but he keeps rambling off course to discuss other events. In this movie version, the filmmakers add an extra postmodern layer by making a movie about how difficult it is to make a movie of "Tristram Shandy." Oddly enough, the filmmakers actually make a pretty good case for translating this supposedly unfilmable novel to the screen. The first 30 minutes of the movie are a faithful adaptation of "Tristram Shandy"--meaning, it includes the digressions and comic asides that make the novel so distinctive. Steve Coogan plays Tristram narrating the events of his own birth, as well as Tristram's father Walter; Rob Brydon plays Tristram's eccentric Uncle Toby. For an adaptation of a long and difficult 18th-century novel, it's surprisingly snappy and enjoyable.Then things get even more "meta," when the perspective shifts to watching the actors, writers, and aides try to film this version of "Tristram Shandy." Though "A Cock and Bull Story" is always clever and entertaining, I felt it lost something when the behind-the-scenes action started up: it became slower and shaggier. The "real-world" problems facing the characters (film production running overbudget, last-minute rewrites, Steve Coogan's messy love life) are too numerous, and few of them ever get resolved. As a comparison, my favorite making-of-a-movie movie is "Day for Night," which better integrates the film-within-the-film into the storyline, and shows more sympathy for its characters.The characters in "A Cock and Bull Story," however, are caricatures of recognizable movie-industry types, and the actors seem to enjoy playing exaggerated versions of themselves. Coogan and Brydon make a classic comedy double act--Coogan the egotistical, condescending big shot and Brydon the runner-up constantly trying to knock him down a peg. Their improvised riffs are a highlight of the movie.The eccentricities of "Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story" will definitely appeal to people who like "British humor." But the nice thing about the movie is that for every dry, cerebral joke, there's a broad populist joke that involves people getting injured or humiliated--the stuff of low comedy. Best scene is where Coogan gets lowered, head first, into a giant papier-mach womb: it's both a hilarious visual gag that anyone can appreciate, and a more refined joke about the crazy things that happen while making a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Honest Crack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Laurence Stern's "The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman" is considered the first meta-fiction novel. Written in the 1700's, before the phrase or even concept of 'meta-fiction' was born, it's the story ? or, rather, Shandy's attempt to tell the story ? of his life. But as all readers know, it's a work of epic digression, the tale of nearly everything else but the life of its title character. It's also considered the most unfilmable work in the English canon. So give the restless director Michael Winterbottom respect for his ingenious attempt in Tristram Shandy: A Cock &amp; Bull Story that, while not perfect, is true to its source material in the most important ways.With invaluable assistance from his leads Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon, Winterbottom has created a meta-film: a meditation on the novel that plays as a movie-within-a-movie. After setting up the conceit with a scene of the actors in make-up discussing the subtleties of billing, and the color of Brydon's teeth, we're cast into Sterne's knotty and bawdy world, brought to vivid life with all the technical sleight-of-hand film can offer. Coogan, as both Shandy and his father, narrates the story of his birth, popping in and out of scenes as character and actor, commenting on the proceedings, interrupting them, revising them. The backstory of the drama between the actors parallels that of the movie, especially the growing competition between Coogan and Brydon, and the numerous deviations of the director, the other actors, and the crew. Winterbottom's film is a stunt that doesn't fully succeed ? the last third, especially, fails to contextualize the detours of the filmic narrative and the filmmaker's dilemmas. It simply dead ends. But it's a wildly inventive, honest crack at an impossible novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film set in quicksand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story" takes a film about making a film to the next level. The film they are making is based on a novel that, sure enough, is about writing a novel. It's a modern-day version of Jean-Luc Godard's, "Le Mpris (Contempt)"; but instead of trying to put Ulysses on celluloid, "Tristram Shandy" follows a crew as they attempt to adapt Laurence Sterne's circuitous novel, "The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman," a not-so-simple task for a novel that is famed for being "unfilmable." The structure of the screenplay is an amazing accomplishment in itself. For instance, the lead, Steve Coogan, plays Tristram Shandy, Tristram Shandy's father, and himself, all while the cast and crew nonchalantly switch between the 18th and 21st centuries.The first portion of the film is an adaptation of "The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman." Tristram Shandy recounts the events surrounding his quite eccentric childhood. Tristram watches from the sidelines as a child-actor recreates his experience of having a heavy window close on him as he is relieving himself out of a window. Why out the window? Who knows? Shandy then forms an unspoken bond with his uncle, Toby Shandy (Rob Brydon), who also had an accident in the same general anatomical area during a war.Somewhere along the line, the director, who is now actually on screen, yells, "Cut!" The first glimpse of the crew behind the making of the movie is revealed. Coogan's assistant hustles into the room, asking if he wants coffee, the Director of Photography yells about the lighting, and the producer sits close by, diligently vocalizing his various concerns.Here, we are introduced to Steve Coogan, a man plagued with self-doubt. He has a wife who struggles for his attention. He has a recently born child. He has people calling his name left and right. He carries the guilt of being unfaithful to his wife. He has an attractive assistant who throws herself at him. He is disillusioned with life. It is hard not to feel sorry for him, but at the same time, it is hard not to want to yell, "Get over yourself!" He has it pretty easy. At this point, Steve does not deserve our sympathy.The pacing slows greatly during Coogan's story, especially compared to the earlier adaptation of the novel, which has faultless comedic timing and an engrossing, quirky storyline. The cinematography takes a dramatic change also. The filming becomes documentary-like, with the entirety of filming done on hand-held and an observable over reliance on rack-focuses. Although this cinematography may accomplish the overall goal of visualizing a meta-film, it becomes a little too haughty and self-absorbed. With the already grandiose weight taken on with the plot alone, the overuse of these visual goodies ends up diverting the concentration of the viewer.As the multiple stories begin to interweave, the similarities between the new father, Coogan, and Tristram's father, Walter, become apparent; both of their families are unsteady, their sex lives are struggling, and they are wary about where their lives are headed. But, deep in the hearts of Coogan and Walter, there is goodness. And the story of "Tristam Shandy" lies in this evolution from wariness to something close to goodness.The screenplay's structure is birthed as a shapeless, oozing blob that flows into the infinite. But, as every character begins to find a footing in the quicksand, the overall shape and structure of the film can be, at the most, grappled with. What we find from this ever-evolving shape is most definitely a celebration: a celebration of human error, existence, and storytelling at its bulkiest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever without being pretentious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Michael Winterbottom's earlier film 24 HOUR PARTY PEOPLE, this is a genre-defying English film that's part adaptation of Laurence Stern's Tristram Shandy and part an on-set comedy about film-making.It stars Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon as Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon. In their opening exchange - sitting in the make-up chair, waiting to go on-set - Brydon wonders what colour his teeth are ("Tuscan Sunset, pub ceiling"). They're making a film of Tristram Shandy, though what we see of their adaptation never really gets beyond the title character's birth as it continually digresses into such areas as Tristram's conception, his Uncle Toby's military exploits and how to use the new forceps at Tristram's delivery. Coogan also plays both the narrator Shandy and his own father, Walter.This is part of the film's ingenious and enjoyable approach, designed to bewilder and alienate as many of the audience as it impresses. Also some of the jibes about Coogan's TV alter-ego Alan Partridge may be lost on a non-British audience. There's a terrific supporting cast, including Jeremy Northam as the director, Ian Hart as the film's screenwriter, Dylan Moran as the doctor, Kelly McDonald as Coogan's live-in girlfriend and Gillian Anderson as Gillian Anderson. Here's a film that's clever without being remotely pretentious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant, deliriously entertaining "adaptation" of an unfilmable book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years, it has been proved no book, no matter how long or complex, is unfilmable (for a confirmation, just watch L.A. Confidential). The only possible exception could be Laurence Sterne's The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, which has been described as both an anti-novel, for its Tarantinoesque lack of linearity (by the end of the whole thing the protagonist isn't even born yet), and a meta-novel, as the main character, Tristram Shandy, is fully aware of the fact that he's a fictional character. Another spot-on definition comes from Steve Coogan, who calls the book "a postmodern novel written before there was any modernism to be post about". How do you adapt such material for the screen? According to director Michael Winterbottom and writer Frank Cottrell Boyce, you don't: instead, you make a movie about a bunch of people who are trying to produce a film based on Sterne's prose. In other words, a meta-film about a failed attempt to adapt a meta-novel. And, as crazy as it may sound, the actual movie is pretty damn good.A Cock and Bull's Story's self-referential nature is revealed from the beginning, as the film opens with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon sitting in the make-up chair and receiving the final touches before going on camera. These moments are usually an occasion for engaging in friendly chats. Coogan and Brydon, on the other hand, end up having Seinfeld-style debates on whose name should appear first on the film's poster or what color Brydon's teeth are ("Pub ceiling" is Coogan's deadpan opinion). Subsequently, we get to see half an hour of the film-within-a-film: Coogan plays both Tristram and his father Walter (apparently because they're physically similar), while Brydon has the unenviable task of portraying the awkward Uncle Toby. Between takes, the cast and crew discuss whether to discard parts of the novel or not (Brydon is in favor of a rewrite, since he would like more screen-time), Coogan casually flirts with his assistant Jennie (Naomie Harris), the only crew-member who has actually read the book, and a reporter shows up claiming to have a story about the leading man's activities with a stripper, which might cause some trouble since Coogan's girlfriend (Kelly Macdonald) and newborn son are paying a visit on the set.The film is incredibly complex but also hugely enjoyable, thanks mainly to Coogan and Brydon's double act: the former, substantially making a parody of his own role in 24 Hour Party People, is constantly fun to watch as he moves from one surreal situation to the other (the highlight being arguably the scene where he gets lowered, head first, inside a gigantic womb - something that has to be seen to be believed), while the latter, having to play a supporting part both in reality and in the fake Shandy film, gets back at his more famous co-star by shamelessly mocking him (his Coogan impression is comedy gold, as is his take on Al Pacino's acting style). The supporting cast is equally strong, featuring stylish cameos from some of the UK's finest thespians (Ian Hart and Stephen Fry among them). With their help, Winterbottom constructs an intricate, fascinating universe, which serves as much as a reflection on cinema as a satire on the film-making process. And despite the bizarre premise, the movie isn't that hard to follow, with the exception of a few in-jokes (Tony Wilson's cameo in particular) that may be lost on those not familiar with Coogan's previous work.In short, A Cock and Bull Story can seem a little too experimental or demanding at first, but beyond the apparent post-modernism (pun not intended) lies a devilishly clever, eminently watchable comedy. Rarely has movie-making looked so funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tristram Shandy is a rare event in the mainstream media. A comedy... aimed at adults... based on a classic novel. For that it should be applauded. It has it's moments and it's target audience is likely to find it infinitely preferable to an Adam Sandler movie, as I do. But when all is said and done I can't tell you any benefit this layering provides. The Tristram Shandy movie is rapidly abandoned in deference to a "not-making of" sidebar, which turns the movie into a Steve Coogan vehicle in exactly the same way that Click is an Adam Sandler vehicle.Since Tristram Shandy is unfilmable, you need to be satisfied with a movie will stay on Tristrams birth for so long, as in the book, that no other plot point will be covered. Instead we cut to the "real-world" plot which deals with a "too many chiefs" plot line, where Coogan toys with the never-before investigated idea that actors are vain, self-absorbed people. (Jack Benny called. He wants his material back) This is not a rich vein to mine jokes from. Yeah, the humor is better and more sophisticated than a Touchstone comedy and to my great relief there isn't a fart joke in the whole movie, but in case it slipped your mind, straight guys are still very anxious about homosexuality. Isn't that terrific? Gosh I really hope we can get 5,000 more years of lazy jokes out of that idea.So it's not Tristram Shandy; which is too bad because the movie they are making is pretty funny. Instead a viewer must be contented with Coogans desert-dry musings and a fairly flat rivalry with his friend. As with most movies the first hour reflects more thought, humor and tighter editing than the rest which falls to pieces.Accusations of originality in the reviews here are bewildering. The "making of" 2nd storyline is now the de-rigeur, accepted, post-modern story structure exhausted in three dozen other better movies. Every time you rent a DVD and watch any of the extra materials you're as post-modern as this movie is. That's how limp it is in terms of originality. Even conceptually it's ripping off a previous movie, Lost in LaMancha, by Terry Gilliam, (a director whose work I haven't been able to bear since the beginning) which was about an unmake-able movie of Don Quixote. The contrast between the Tristram Shandy characters and the actors is used to (what else?) show the parallels between them. This is lifted from any number of movies but let's go with the once over-rated, now forgotten "French Leiutenant's Woman." It's unsatisfying in both.Steve Coogan has a plain but handsome &amp; open face. I'd like to see him play a dramatic role and really commit to something.</fullReview>

Those that don't find it funny, however, are remaining quiet.Well, I'd like to tell the world this: it is NOT that funny. Sure, there's a few giggles. But once you get past the self indulgent, and overly self-referential joke that the film is "about a film being made", there is nothing left to really hold your captivation and fascination.I think those people who are calling it hilarious, are just easily amused by this *clever* play on film-making. It's clever, and only mildly amusing. If you don't believe me, go see it. You won't be laughing that much unless the concept alone, and odd funny scene, can keep you amused for 90 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Unfilmable, made Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At one point in the film "Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story," the character Tony Wilson states that the novel "Tristram Shandy" is said by "many people" to be "unfilmable." This quote has been picked up by almost all reviewers and commentators, many of them ignoring the point that this is a position held by one of the fictional characters, and not that of the film-makers themselves. Indeed, until this film started to be promoted, I doubt many people ever considered the "filmability" (or not) of Sterne's novel.(I've read other, similar confusions of statements by fictional characters with facts: At one point the lead, Steve Coogan, states that by the end of the book Tristram Shandy isn't even born. This is not true -- He's certainly born by page 225 in the edition I own -- yet I've read several reviews and blogs (even on this site!) which repeat this as a fact about the novel.)However, this raises the issue in my mind what makes a book "filmable" or not: to my mind, Woolf's "Orlando" and Burrough's "Naked Lunch" are two of the least "filmable" novels of the 20th century, yet both have been made into quite fine movies. What makes these films, as well as "Tristram Shandy," work, is that more than just transferring plot and characters from words to screen (there might not be much of those), they transfer something less concrete but more important -- mood. In "Tristram Shandy" the spirit is one of playful wit and drollery, expressed in the novel by exuberant use of language and word-play, whimsical digressions (and digressions from those digressions), and reality-bending self-reference. All of these have been transposed to cinematic form, resulting in a very funny film!This is a costume-drama which mocks costume-dramas, an art-film which mocks art-films. The first 25 minutes, when Steve Coogan is mostly acting in the roles of Tristram or Walter Shandy, I think are the most laugh-out-loud funny of the movie. In the latter two third, when he is acting in the role of "Steve Coogan," the humor is drier, more droll than boisterous. The one (and just one) nagging flaw I find in this film, is that it would be more effective, and truer to Sterne's literary style, to have these two parts less sectioned off from one another, more commingled and spliced together.As a musician, I must make mention of the sound-track, which cleverly alludes to other costume-dramas by quoting the soundtracks to "The Draughtsman's Contract" (Nyman) and "Barry Lyndon" (Handel), as well "8 1/2" (Rota), like this, a film about making a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere near as funny as it should have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie deals with the making of a movie based on an 18th century novel. About halfway into it, the following dialog about the movie-in-the-movie can be heard: "Why are we devoting a year of our lives to making this movie anyway?" "Because it's funny." "Is that all?" "Yes, if it's genuinely funny, that is enough. But it has to be genuinely funny."Unfortunately, the "real" movie is not even close to being genuinely funny. The jokes are few, most of them are lame, and some jokes which are mildly amusing are destroyed by being drawn out to interminable length. Nor does the movie work as an adaptation of the novel, because very little of substance is shown from the novel, or said about it.Instead, most of the movie is taken up with the uninteresting personal life of actor/comedian Steve Coogan, presented in a very pretentious fashion. (Examples: is Coogan a bigger star than co-actor Rob Brydon, and should this be emphasized by having Coogan wear shoes with higher heels than Brydon? Does Coogan have time to make love to his wife who has turned up at the place of the filming with their child, or is he too distracted by his work?) This material is excruciatingly boring and (due to the pretentiousness) severely annoying.It is symptomatic of the lack of substance and originality of this movie that much of its soundtrack is borrowed from other, much better movies: Fellini's masterpiece 8 1/2, which also deals with the making of a movie, but in a much more intelligent (and funnier) way, and Peter Greenaway's The Draughtsman's Contract, still one of the best movies from the UK in the last 30 years.To sum up: this movie is a failure, and not even an interesting failure. You may want to see it if (in the words of another reviewer) "Steve Coogan is the most important person in your entire universe", and if you don't mind long stretches of boredom interrupted by the occasional lame joke. Otherwise, don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not good enough.There are two levels of humor here, one involving film production, and one basic to the Tristram Shandy story. There is humor in this kind of juxtaposition, especially in the contrast between the actor of Tristram and his father, and the life of their actors. But it doesn't stand out as anything special, and the dramatic quality is too shallow, if you have been seeing other recent films. The level of humor of the Tristram Shandy story itself reminds me of Vaudeville.The broken disjointed aspect of the story telling could have been fascinating (e.g. Memento), but in this case it acted as a barrier to getting involved in the characters and the story, because you jump away just as your interest is growing.The funniest parts were contrasting the life of Tristram's father and the life of the actor, the womb scenes, and the scenes in the closing credits. Also, people in the industry might enjoy the behind-the-scenes back-story about actor rivalries, costuming issues, etc.I feel this could have been so much better. As it was, I feel like I had endured an unpleasant theme park ride which was lightened up only by the scenes included during the credits.</fullReview>

Starting with the logo for "The works", showing three interlocking gear wheels, which if this was made in reality, would not work. The same has to be said for this film. This is a film of indulgence, self indulgence. On the part of the titles people, making "different" lettering. Unreadable, but different. Then the two "stars" being different, Coogan and Brydon offering a feast of pointless observation starting in the first scene about the colour of Brydon's teeth while in the make up department. Why, I will never know. Then being different, talking to screen with a pointless dialogue, about....."but then I will tell you of this later"....which never came. Jumping from an eighteenth? century battle, to before Tristram Shandy was borne, (Oh by the way, that is who this film was supposed to be about), then accompanied by twenty first century film crew mixing with the characters, then back again to the film, and so on, and NO STORY. The only laughs I could detect were the ones from the owners of the mobile catering company, who must have made a FORTUNE out of all this, laughing all the way to THEIR bank.

It is not only an exercise in stroking the egos of the actors and the director but it is also trying to be far too clever which results in a film that doesn't engage the audience. Film within a film, in jokes blah blah blah. Everything that this film is trying to do was done much better and much funnier in 'extras' the Ricky Gervais sitcom. Considering I love so many of the faces in this film it hurts me to say that no one really stands outs or gives a good performance, Coogan is overblown, Bryden boring, Moran drunk? Fry under-used and Anderson out of place. All in all this is another British example of how not to make a film. The director of such beautiful films as 'Wonderland' and 'Welcome to Sarajevo' really needs to look long and hard at himself because he hasn't made a decent film in years and this does nothing to dispel that fact.</fullReview>

It has the same fabric as the play's outer dressing and none of the muscle and blood of the thing.Alas. One of our most intelligent filmmakers, someone who thinks about film and actually has new, clever ideas. Pay attention to "9 Songs" ? if you can ? and you'll be blown away. And one of our richest books. We don't have many in English, now that Ireland is a theme park for tourists. This book is not only folded in marvelous, manifold ways (many would say self- referential, but that's unduly limiting), it is a milestone in literature absolutely. The problem with the film is aptly noted in the film. At some point, they decided that every effect, every narrative overlay, would be done for comic effect and no other. So. You'll find this amusing, slightly, with only one style of humor served up a couple different ways.You will find better humor that plays with these notions elsewhere. At least, in true folded form, they tell us why in the film. Its because the guys in charge only understand "funny." There are some wonderful metabits where "deep" cinematic effect is brought up in discussions and the "guys in charge" are completely oblivious. It isn't like that opening scene in "The Player" where cinematic pretense is made fun of, and then ruthlessly exploited. No. Here the film really does ignore everything it was intended to be.I'll have to wait, I suppose, for a Winterbottom project that has a less clever source, so he can add his own notions, rather than be faced with a warehouse of attitudes and only grab those on the bottom shelf.Every scene with Naomie Harris is worth watching, in content and style. The rest, well, watch "The Company" instead if you just want to laugh, of "Singing Detective" if you want Shandy in film.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Laurence Sterne wrote "The Life And Opinions Of Tristram Shandy", a comic meta-novel, in the mid 1700s. The novel has been described as a "postmodern novel before there was any modernism to be post about", as it is narrated by a bumbling author (Tristram Shandy) who frequently becomes sidetracked whilst writing his own biography. As the novel unfolds, its plot literally disintegrates and digresses into disorder, the author increasingly dwelling upon insignificant details and going off on wild tangents. Packed with jokes, the novel is also perhaps the only autobiography which starts with its hero's birth and ends, hundreds of pages later, only a few moments after he has been born. Think of Sterne as an 18th century version of meta-fictionist Charlie Kaufman.But Sterne's book was not only a deliberate reaction again the linear narratives of the 18th century, but a response to the determinism of Newtonian science. What he did was create a sort of "chaotic dynamical system", one of infinite possibilities, and then ironically counterpointed this with a narrator (a gentleman adventurer called Tristram Shandy) who was single-mindedly obsessed with finding "the initial condition" of his birth. Obsessed with mapping his "causality", in an attempt to find the "reason he is who he is".Of course, instead of finding an answer, Tristram finds himself lost in multiplicity, his narrative sprawling in all directions, investigating every avenue in the futile hope of finding some concrete cause. What the book ultimately finds is only a kind of indeterminism; constant new information, constant new matter. There is no fixed origin that would account for who and what Tristram Shandy is."Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story" is a 2006 comedy by director Michael Winterbottom. The film is structured as a documentary about a film adaptation of Sterne's book, which was itself a book about the writing of a book. And like Sterne's novel, the larger philosophical point of Winterbottom's film is that it is impossible to assert order to chaos, that the director/author/Trisram's failure to master his narrative is itself the plight of humanity, and that we are all the products of a series of highly absurd past events (in Tristram's case, REALLY absurd).The film stars Steven Coogan and Rob Brydon, two comedians largely unknown outside of England and Wales. Coogan contributes the acid humour and Brydon, as always, plays an endearing, lovable nincompoop. The film's plot is lightweight, and its humour very slight, except for a wonderful closing sequence in which Coogan and Brydon impersonate Al Pacino.8/10 ? The same story as "Synecdoche, New York", but more light-footed. The film borrows heavily from Truffaut's "Day for Night".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that subtly hits you over the head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tristram Shandy" is first and foremost a cock and bull story. The comedy is not delivered via a typical linear story arc or by humorous turns of phrase that are funny regardless of context. Rather, Shandy explores the ideas that humor and insight into the human condition can be gained through a film that is highly self-referential and that breaks the rules of conventional storytelling. Beyond this, the film tries to create subtle shifts in audience mood through some seemingly blatant manipulation. These are not easily accomplished goals for a ninety minute film. In fact, Shandy hinges on several assumptions that it makes about who are watching the film. If a potential viewer finds that they, for whatever reason, cannot abide by these initial assumptions, this film will be experienced as a painful bore rather than a nuanced study of the interaction of life and art.The first and possibly most important assumption is that the audience member watching the film will immediately engage the characters and scenarios without having much context. Such an engagement is similar to joining a group of stranger's conversation while at a bar. The bar's convivial atmosphere encourages socialization but actually braking into a new "world" without much prior context is difficult and sometimes uncomfortable. Shandy requires that one take the initial plunge into another "world" very quickly. If one does enter the Shandy world, they are rewarded with rich, sarcastic, and dynamic characters. If one chooses to remain aloof and simply watch the film, then the film quickly degrades into the boring obnoxiousness of being at a bar with a loud and distracting table of strangers.Secondly, Shandy functions when the audience does not pass immediate judgment on the characters. There are no real stock characters to be found here. As such, each character has a variegated personality consisting of positive and negative aspects. Again, think of the bar situation. If one introduced themselves to a table of strangers and then judged them all as boring within thirty seconds, the outcome would be awkward to say the least. Shandy works when the audience interacts with the characters as if they are new acquaintances. Just as new people in our social spheres reveal their personalities over time, the characters in Shandy develop throughout the course of the film. In addition, just as we decide if new people in our social spheres are "good" or "bad," Shandy's characters gain depth if we put them through this extended judgment process.A final assumption is that audience members are able to detect and appreciate fast paced and unexpected sarcasm. In all honesty, this is by far the most difficult challenge to the viewer. As mentioned above, the audience is being asked to quickly loose itself in the context of a somewhat banal world of these complex characters. Now, the audience is also being asked to keep on the lookout for humorous quips and behavior patterns derived from the above mentioned context. This is possibly the least valid of the assumptions. Most audiences are willing to suspend disbelief and loose themselves in the moment (at least I hope they do), yet asking a bunch of strangers to join you for some inside jokes after interacting with them for five to ten minutes is bound to cause problems. Some members of the audience may not want to be included or perhaps miss many of the jokes and humor due to lack of context. If one does realize what is expected of them, the film has a wonderful ability to manipulate and tickle you with some rather brazen tactics. For example, the actor playing Tristram is being visited by his girlfriend and newborn son. In addition, the previous night, the same actor is portrayed as kissing a lovely production assistant. The audience is given the briefest of contexts for establishing the Tristram actor as a lecherous jerk. In a following scene, the actor, director, story writer, and crew discuss how to make Tristram's father's character more appealing to the audience. In the end, the group decides that a scene involving the father holding and caring for his infant son would sway the audience to like him. Following the meeting, the actor finds that his son is crying and takes a minute to change his diaper and sing to him. The lecherous jerk is almost immediately given a "get out of jail free" card due to his kindly actions. The connection is ridiculously blatant. Film crew discusses how to make an unlikeable character more likable and then an unlikeable character does the very same thing. As audience, we are outright told what to expect and yet when it happens, the tender feelings that develop become surprisingly normal. In addition, one is tickled upon realizing the manipulation and the success of the manipulation.In regards to technical notes, Shandy is by all means a professional film. The camera work, editing, pacing, sound, and acting are all very well done. Shandy potentially falters by asking a great deal from an unsuspecting audience. It could be construed as a design flaw that a film practically needs a user's manual before watching. That said, if one does take the time to fulfill the assumptions of the film makers, Shandy is a very humorous look at the idiosyncrasies of a particular group of people.On a personal note, I will be recommending this film to my friends and colleagues. It is somewhat challenging as an experience, but leaves the viewer with the feeling that they just finished a well cooked good meal. I would rank this a 7.5 if possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>uneven but very funny at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lawrence Sterne's 18th Century novel, "The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman" has long been viewed as a largely "unfilmable" work due to its enormous length and famously idiosyncratic style. The bawdy, satirical tome, done in the form of a mock-autobiography, originally appeared in nine volumes and broke new artistic ground by employing the kind of stream-of-consciousness narration and self-referential self-awareness that would later come to define the post-modernist style of 20th and 21st Century literature. As one of the characters in the movie exclaims, the ahead-of-its-time "Shandy" was already post-modern before modern existed.The movie, "Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story," is NOT a version of the novel either but rather a droll, frequently hilarious faux-documentary about one movie crew's valiant but futile attempt to bring this unwieldy literary work to the silver screen. Writer Frank Cottrell-Boyce and director Michael Winterbottom have used Sterne's novel as a mere reference point for their own slashing satire on film-making in general and the adaptation of great novels in particular. Indeed, the movie is as much a tribute to Fellini's "8 1/2" - another film about a filmmaker's struggle to complete a challenging movie - as it is to "Tristram Shandy." The movie makers even employ Nina Rota's score from that film as background for the action rather than music that would more accurately reflect the period of the story. Talk about post-modern! Steve Coogan plays himself as the actor hired on to inhabit the roles of both Tristram and his father, Walter, in the film that is being made. Joining him is Rob Brydon, who also plays himself as well as Tristram's uncle, Toby. In the modern scenes, the two are acutely funny as they squabble over how each is to play his respective part and who is to be allotted the most time on screen. However, the best parts of the movie are the scenes re-creating the novel on film, which are done with an anarchic spirit and a freewheeling cleverness that put one in mind of Tony Richardson's "Tom Jones." With their raillery and wit, these sequences almost convince us that, given the sufficient resources and the proper talents, maybe a decent movie COULD be made of Sterne's novel (or at least a small part of it) after all.Some of the film-making sequences are enjoyable as well, zeroing in on the compromises brought about by having to balance budgetary restraints with personal egos. Yet, the movie tends to run out of steam the further away it gets from Sterne's original story. Coogan is amusing as a character when he is focused on the mechanics of his acting, but he's far less interesting when brooding about his troubled relationship with his girlfriend, his role as a new daddy or his contemplation of an affair with his attractive assistant. These scenes, which take up a significant portion of the final act of the movie, wind up draining away much of the cleverness and energy that are found in such abundance during the earlier stretches of the film. Yet, if "A Cock and Bull Story" finally dribbles away into insignificance at the end, it still provides us with an hour and a half or so of really hearty laughter as compensation. And considering how few genuine laughs one generally encounters in movies these days, that's a strong bit of compensation indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Strange Admixture of Story and Method</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve Coogan is irresistibly entertaining in this offbeat film - a movie within a movie that crosses portions of a fine novel with the machinations if turning that novel into a film. Yes, this has been done successfully before, but rarely with the loonieness and candor that suffuses this entertaining insider look at making a novel visual.Director Michael Winterbottom and the entire cast and crew making the film Tristram Shandy follow a script (by Frank Cottrell Boyce), but in a manner that feels like extemporaneous commentary on the 18th century Lawrence Sterne novel. Steve Coogan is introduced as the makeup artists are altering his nose and facial features to reflect those of Tristram while his co-star Rob Brydon is being transformed into the character of Captain Shandy. From conversations about technical aspects of shooting a film the camera splices into actual scenes from the 'movie', most of which deal with the birthing of Tristram. The purpose of the film reflects an aspect of the book about a man who is attempting to delve into the history and actions that result in the creation of the title character.The cast is strong: in addition to Coogan and Brydon, the minor roles are filled by Jeremy Northam, Kelly Macdonald, Shirley Henderson, Benedict Wong, Keeley Hawes, Gillian Anderson, Naomie Harris in addition to the costumers and makeup artists as well drawn characters in and of themselves! For many the film may feel disjointed and meandering, but give into the concept of the delightful mix of shortcuts enhanced by commentary from the actors and crew and this Cock and Bull story is a terrific costume period piece romp. It is just meant to be fun and full of chuckles. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Linear meta</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sucker for meta, so my enjoyment of this film was all but guaranteed. However, aside from a disorienting ending, A Cock and Bull Story is actually quite linear, largely giving us a 24-hour period in the making of an actual Tristram Shandy film (the original British title making the point that this is not that film; presumably it was changed because we Americans genuinely don't know what a "cock and bull story" is).Much of it, then, consists of Steve Coogan portraying himself. He's clearly the protagonist in Michael Winterbottom's film, but his most of the Coogan character's efforts are spent making sure that he will in fact be the protagonist and lead in the film that "Mark" is making. Considering that I'd never even heard of Coogan before, I was quite glad that the American DVD distributor included a trailer for the box set of his old mock talk show, which comes up several times throughout the film (and is therefore a must-view for fellow clueless yank viewers; it's the last one that plays before you get to the menu). Even with this admittedly fuzzy knowledge, I still really enjoyed Coogan's persona and the unerringly hilarious antics that the film provides. There's also a lot of good observations and snarky commentary implicit in the how Winterbottom deals with high literature and high film, and the usual cluelessness that the characters, especially Coogan, have regarding both despite the task at hand. Amazingly, there is even a bit of a plot too; it's just not Shandy's story, although I did actually wish we'd seen a bit more of that, despite my appreciation of what I did get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great postmodern romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tristam Shandy is a film that lives within its own sense of irony. A supposedly unfilmable book seems to have been turned into a fine movie, and doing so was no small feat.Not since The Icycle Thief has a movie managed to delve into the oddity that can be known as postmodernism. While the term has been tossed around for years by illiterates who have no grasp of what the word means, Tristam Shandy provides a nice segue into the definition of such a complex strain of thought. The viewer, however, is left in a rather precarious position: Is the film trying to be postmodern or is the postmodernism of the film meant to be an accurate dedication to the book? For those who haven't read the book (like myself) the interest generated by the film brings about a desire to read the book. Granted, I'm sure there are no scenes of a life-sized womb in the book, but then again, who would have thought that would have turned into such a great sight gag?Steve Coogan really stole the show in this film, easily bringing out the supposed egomaniac that was the Steve Coogan in the movie (or is this the real Steve Coogan---hard to say). While she had a small role, Gillian Anderson's addition to the latter stages of the film brought a boost as the film started lagging in the final third of the film. It was a well acted movie all together, and I felt that was a strength within the movie. Watch if you don't like straight forward films, but don't watch it if you're not good at figuring out complex story lines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This lucidly intelligent satire attacks the traditions of adapting, filming, and acting on all fronts except for the normal ones, producing an interesting wit-fest that will most definitely only find appreciation from more literary or intellectually humor-minded folks. The high britsh pedigree from the source material and insider hollywoodism's, amidst the subtle web of potent, multi-layered humor in which the movie relays it's processes would all but engage most closer-minded viewers. Using the clever contrast of adapting the novel Tristam Shandy, this film within a film plays like a pseudo documentary/sketch comedy about the making and behind the scenes antics if this "unfilmable" novel. Think of this labor of love as an English version of Adaptation, stripped down to it's core components, dealing more with the filming frustrations of creativity rather then the writing ones. Unfortunately most of this low key streamlined brilliance will be lost on the majority of American viewers, and to be quite frank: this movie should not have even appealed to me as much as it did, having no original affinity with the book on which it is based and lacking any true depth with it's detached pacing, I still found myself becoming transformed by the hypnotic scripting Winterbottom brings to life in this move for genre elevation. In the end, if you are willing to enjoy your comedies from a different, more patient angle then most, the perceptive material will have a continuous smile across your film loving face.</fullReview>

A few times I wanted to scream out, "Get on with it".

		<shortDescription>Low , Stupid, But Inspiring Helpless Laughter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is some actual Tristam Shandy from the novel in the movie, but really the movie is about the making of the movie. The actors Coogan and Brydon fight and tease each other continually throughout. The movie opens with Brydon going on and on about his teeth and his appearance to Coogan, and I thought, how am I going to get through the rest of this? If hadn't been for the $10.75 and the cold outside, I would have gotten up and left. Coogan and Brydon are just like actors I have known in real life, narcissistic and not much interested in the intellect. In the last scene they were doing the same thing and I was laughing and unable to stop, although they still irritated me. Brydon was going on and on about how he takes from Streisand and Pacino and imitates both of them. Brydon also imitates Coogan. Apparently Coogan is much more of a star than Brydon and Brydon is jealous of him, but as I don't watch British TV I'm not really sure if this was all made up for the film.Coogan has a minor love interest, Jenny, who is black and another, more serious girlfriend also named Jenny (white), who visits the hotel the movie is using as a base, with her baby by Coogan. He neglects both of them. The first Jenny is a sort of gofer who is forced to continually interact with Coogan even after meeting her rival, and is held to be ridiculous because she admires Fassbinder films. Her interest in Coogan remains even after she realized the position Coogan has put her in with the second Jenny. As an audience member I felt a little like Jenny, laughing despite myself, as if I had a hopeless crush on some jerk, and mocked by the film for expecting it to have some intellectual content. But yet it was an experience well worth the price of admission. Coogan is held by Brydon to have lost his libido, but the film delivers.What it delivers I'm not exactly sure.</fullReview>

Okay, count me among the fervent admirers.

If you've read the book, tried and failed to read the book, or never opened the book or even heard of it, I think this movie is worth a shot. (SPOILER)I loved the use of music here, especially the extensive quotes from Nino Rota's score for "81/2". It's very apropos; the film is a sort of "81/2" without the angst.

		<shortDescription>a bit too much like the entire thing was a special feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually am a Lawrence Stern fan of sorts. His only other work -- A Sentimental Journal through Europe and France is one of the top novels of all time -- chronologically speaking that is. I doubt very many people realize why Tristram Shandy contains such bad chronological order or poor story telling. It wasn't to be POST MODERN (whatever that silly term means), it was to make fun of the boring, pretentious and poorly organized memoirs by self important aristocrats that were frequently published at the time. Similarly his Sentimental journey was a parody of published travel journals -- but also in the end made an important point about travel -- get to know the people, not just the scenery. The problem with this film is it misses the entire context of the book -- so the book gets interpreted as post modern (before there was a modern to be post about), rather than very very much a part of the 18th century where it was created. Similar decontextualized interpretations are often given to Bosch painting.I don't think the idea of a film about making a film is particularly new... in fact the French Leutenants Woman was done in a very similar style (but contained more of the novel in it). So its not a new way to approach a novel. Although today we find the book unreadable, it was very popular in its day and for a while, winding a watch in public was tantamount to an sexual assault... not sure if the sex/watch connection was discussed in the film.The film was funny but I felt it was too much like one enormous special feature -- where the directors and actors and so on ramble on about how they made the film and pat themselves over the back for their own brilliance and insight. A special features with special features about it -- and commentaries about the special feature. To be honest I usually get bored about 5 minutes into those sorts of special features unless it is about the historical context (e.g., Gangs of New York), or how they created special effects (e.g., The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen), or the deleted scenes (which tell you a lot about the process of filming, but usually leave me thinking, "thank god that scene was deleted"). The opinions of actors and directors are usually not worth listening too. Even Monty Python were dreadfully boring when they were talking about how they made their film (e.g., special features for Life of Brian, yawn). One advantage of the style used in this film I guess is that we will not have anyone complaining about problems with continuity or bloopers such as having the boom visible... One of the funniest scenes in the film is when the baby is being born, when they pan back and you see the film crew and that totally shatters the illusion of the film... however it would have been funnier if it had been a surprise -- however I had seen the trailers and therefore knew already that the film was about making the film rather than being about the book.So what am I to make of spending $27 for one long special feature about the making of a movie based on a great novel? I didn't actually want to buy the DVD, but the film was never shown locally and our local rental store had only one copy that was apparently lost. So in desperation I bought it and I'm not altogether happy about my decision to buy it. I'd say, rent it if you can, but buy it? probably not.I was amused, yes, and sometimes found my self laughing quite loudly, but overall I was not pleased. I'd rather have seen a lot more of Laurence Stern's humor, than of the mockumentary about the film cast and crew. In fact I think I would have liked to have seen the film they were filming, rather then a film about the filming of a film.Note, if someone can recall the book, was Tristram only circumcised by the window (I seem to have misplaced my copy). What I do recall is that the lead weights had been removed by the nutty uncle for his military models and the window came crashing down on his manhood. I recall that the book was rather vague as to just how seriously he was injured, but my impression was that it was quite serious. I seem to recall being rather squeamish about the prospects for poor little Tristram for several chapters after the unhappy event. I was a bit jarred when they said circumcised in the film. Are modern audiences more squeamish about painful injuries than 18th century audiences?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tristam Shandy is a satire in itself and how does one satirize a satire without delving to the depths of the lampoon ala Mad Magazine? One of the reasons Mel Brooks Space Balls fell on its nose was because purists felt that the original Star Wars trilogy was in itself a parody of the epic adventure. So, here we have a pile of ego-driven albeit talented people wanting to make a movie out of the mid 18th century novel(?) that runs on for 9 volumes, all of which uses a rather ribald focus on an English country gentleman with extensive allusions and dippings from Cervantes, Rabelais and John Locke of the empiricists. I've met few people who have managed to navigate their way completely through Laurence Sterne's bloated story and I'm certainly not one of them who has but I did approach this film with a certain amount of hope that there would be some fun, as the original work itself is replete with bawdy wit. So, what do we get? Ramblings and musings and a film about how making a film that in itself would seem to be a rather impossible undertaking. I'm afraid the interest wore out rather quickly when the focus of the camera no longer concerned itself with the aforementioned Tristam Shandy and more on the zany perspectives of the two main characters, Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon, who seem determined to confuse the already confused Michael Winterbottom's perspective on how to put this project together. The outcome is ghastly. It is neither here nor there: certainly not a reasonable attempt to bring Sterne's lengthy work to light and certainly not a cogent film about making a film. In short, for those of us who are unfamiliar with British TV, the entire project falls on its nose with the sound and smell of expelled gas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie that shows great skill by its makers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mockumentary about the making of a movie of a supposedly unfilmable book. Firstly, although I haven't read it, what I got from the film is that the book (The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman by Laurence Sterne) is extremely funny. The book (and the movie within the film) begins with Tristram narrating his life, starting with his mother going into labor. However the book is one large digression and he goes on multiple tangents. The book finally ends with him being born. As entertaining as this is, the rest of the film about making the movie is just as funny. It depicts a needy actor who plays Tristram and his constant feelings of inadequacy as the movie's protagonist, and his desires to show up his co-star. The struggle of the film is creating a good movie. It is made even more difficult than usual because of the complexity and lack of plot of the book it is being based on. However this film was made with exceptional skill. In reality, the writers of this film had to write two stories. One for the movie within and one for the actual film. And they had to be somehow tied together to have a unifying idea. Strangely enough, it was done flawlessly. Interpreting the film was made super easy because overall, the theme of the film was the same as the book. In their struggle to make a good movie, the makers of the movie within sought out the help of a literary expert. The expert told them that the theme of the book is that no matter how hard we try plan things out in life we can never control what come about. This was seen in the movie within, and in the real film. The film ended with most of the people working on the film disgruntled and unhappy with the final product. But that's life. The best laid plans of mice and men?This movie was also visually beautiful and inventive. There were some very interesting shots and other cinematography that kept the eye constantly entertained. Some scenes were also very beautifully filmed, framed, and juxtaposed. Additionally there were some beautiful views of the English countryside and more. A very entertaining film, with such complexity and obvious skill that one's appreciation for it cannot help but be augmented. And remember, if it doesn't make you think, it's not worth your time.-Michael</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful a romp through film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"People sometimes say that the way things happen in the movies is unreal, but actually it's the way things happen to you in life that's unreal." Andy Warhol As much as I write about the appreciation of movies, have a screenwriter daughter and talent agent son, the actual making of a movie remains a mystery except through such famous insider films as Day for Night and the recent Adaptation and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Michael Winterbottom's Tristram Shandy, a film about the making of a film about an unfilmable 17th century novel, The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy by Laurence Stern, brings a levity to the genre, a sense that filming is an imperfect science replete with last minute accommodations, intrigues, distress, and mirth?a world unto its own for the time it takes to wrap it up and put it in the can, or computer, as it might be today.Steve Coogan as Shandy and his father is perfect for the role, a comedian just low key enough to spring ironies and sarcasm gently on us voyeurs and delicate enough to make us applaud his character named Steve Coogan remaining faithful to his wife while beset by his own wandering eye and a most attractive p.a. Like the novel itself, these intrigues come to nothing because Winterbottom keeps us all grooving through a sumptuous old Brit estate as if hounded by the inevitably hungry creditors.Central to the enjoyment of the chaos is the friendly rivalry between lead Coogan and his "co-lead" Rob Brydon, a real life comedian. Rob is well aware of his second banana status and open with Coogan about his insecurities, who good-naturedly indulges Rob's prattling about his adulation of Pacino and Streisand and his downright fear of playing opposite Gillian Anderson, who joins the enterprise only to be shocked to see how little of her survives the editing. She is responsible for leading him into the funniest line of the film when she asks Rob's character where he was wounded in the battle scene eventually cut: "Just beyond the asparagus," he responds pointing to the spot on the model.After reminding Coogan that he, Rob, is a "featured co-lead," Coogan dryly responds, "Well, we'll see after the edit." The banter between Coogan and Brydon continues even during the credits as Brydon frets about his bald spot and the excellence of his movie star imitations.It's as delightful a romp through film-making as you could hope for given the ungainly glamour of the process, the uncertainty of the outcome, and the surfeit of talent so necessary for its success or failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've never quite felt this way before.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years back I sat through a weird movie called CQ. It was this film about a visionary young director making a crappy movie. It was about the creative spark that hit people even if the outcome is complete deck. That movie came back to me while sitting through TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY.SHANDY is a kind of mockumentary/period drama about a real actor named Steve Coogan. He's a big star in Britain (really!). He's stars in the film within the film as the lead character Tristram Shandy. The film is based on a popular British novel called The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman. It's a huge novel that will be impossible to film, so of course they do. It also follows Coogan the actor whose life is as chaotic. But to try to sum up the story would be impossible except to say that it's a story about the creative process and the toll it takes on one man and the people around him. Plus Gillian Anderson has a cameo.Yet it's funny. In a British way. Not being aware of much in British humor (except for Monty Python) I missed a lot of jokes. There was a women behind me in the theater that laughed a lot. But except for her this theater was filled with old people and they didn't for the most part make a peep so I'm not quite sure how effective the movie is, but I laughed a little. I especially like the scene with the gigantic birth canal with fallopian tubes that they lowered Coogan into upside down.Yes I will admit the film was a little over my head. Not that I couldn't follow it. I just wondered if their was something more I needed to get. Was there a piece of dialogue that I couldn't quite decipher? I left the movie having seen it but amazingly I forgot most of what I had seen after I left the theater, well except for the giant birth canal.All this to say, that I would like to watch this film again sometime. With other people, and maybe as a group we could figure out if there was some deeper meaning other than that life is chaotic and tragic and our life stories are interesting even if we never get passed how we were born. Even this review is interesting, if kind of random. I apologize for that. Please somebody go see this movie and tell me what I'm missing. Because I liked it, and yet I'm not sure it hit me quite the way I was expecting.One wonders if this review is not a COCK AND BULL STORY on its own . It is as if the way this film was shot and edited together has effected the very way I will interpret cinema forever or maybe I'm just a crazy man who needs to be locked up. Please break me from this misery because I'm at a loss to quite explain the film and yet if you were standing near me I might be able to rattle on for 25 minutes about what the film was about. Hmm... I've never quite felt this way before.All this to say I recommend this film and yet am unable to put the film into any real place. Go see it you'll understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rollicking Tribute to the Spirit of The Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story" is rollickingly faithful to the spirit of the original satirical novel "The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy," Gentleman by Laurence Sterne, who was making up as he went along the literary format we now call a novel, publishing serially from 1760 - 1770. There's a joke in the film that it was listed by The Guardian as the 8th most important book and is corrected, no that was in chronological order . As an innovator Sterne had carte blanche to do whatever he wanted in relation to the reader and director/co-writer Michael Winterbottom free-wheelingly adapts that notion to film.While it's a running joke in this film about making a film of the book that only a production assistant has read the book (but then she also has a thing for obscure Fassbinder films) as well as Stephen Fry playing an on and off screen pompous character, the very broad humor is completely in keeping with the original, with easy sight gags, like demonstrations of the use of forceps, that are very much in keeping with the book. The visual techniques are also parallel to the book, such as an all black screen, freezing the action with the narrator in front, etc.The actors are playing the characters in the novel adaptation as well as actors named for themselves who have some of their same backgrounds, but they are of course all vain and egotistical and full of peccadillos. We also the see usual tabloid journalists, on set flirtations, the lead actor's visiting real baby cries all the time vs. the movie one who spends most of the film being born, animal bodies, etc.While there's jibes like the "co-lead" would only be the lead in the sit com version, it is in fact TV's self-reference that made this conception possible, from George Burns cackling at his co-stars on a precursor to closed-circuit TV to pseudo-reality shows like "It's Garry Shandling's Show," "The Larry Sanders Show," "Unscripted" and "Extras," that go way beyond breaking the fourth wall. That similar tone is what doesn't make this a movie about film-making like other films about film-making, such as "State and Main," "Day for Night" or "Living in Oblivion." Another difference is the period story, so much of the contemporary discussions about authenticity and budgets, including on cell phones, take place while they're changing into 18th century costumes or make-up. The humor, though, oddly slows down the further back stage we get, literally, as we retreat more and more to the characters' off screen lives. The comedy stops when the "Steve Coogan" character actually does become a 21st century man and lovingly takes care of his son. It is very sweet, compared to all the discussion about "Walter", Tristram's father's, relationship with his son. I figured it was intentional that an added bit that Coogan's character insists on adding to the birthing sequence literally falls flat, when there's a comment at the end that another expensive scene has been cut because "it wasn't funny." Coogan is the center of the film and carries off the different levels of the film with finesse, even upside down in a womb with a view, like Steve Carrell in "The 40 Year Old Virgin". Rob Brydon has a wonderful rapport with him as a deflating side kick, though I haven't seen any of their Brit com work to know if this is their ongoing mode, but there's jokes cracked about their relatively minor film work up to now.The rest of the cast is a delightful mix of Brits familiar from TV, like Keeley Hawes of "MI-5 (Spooks)". I couldn't tell if she filmed this before or after giving birth at the end of 2004, but it adds to the amusing reality/not reality that through most of the film she portrays the mother in labor (another actress expresses sympathy that's she's been screaming for three days). I half expected her ex-co-star/now husband Matthew MacFayden to show up as if on the set, but the final credit does say "of course" the characters are fictional.Gillian Anderson is a good sport in brief scenes. I assume it's part of the joke that they are oblivious that she's really no longer in L.A. but lives in Britain. While her "Widow Wadman" sounds like her "Lady Dreadlock" in the marvelous "Bleak House" currently showing on PBS, her dancing eyes show that she has a flair for classic comedy that should get more opportunities to be showcased. The references to "The X Files" are amusing, and reinforce the "Larry Sanders" parallelisms, as David Duchovny, her partner "Mulder", was a frequent guest.The other celebrity references come fast and furious (such as Mel Gibson, Nicole Kidman in "Cold Mountain", and so on) and I'm sure I missed some British jibes, but these are in keeping with Sterne's contemporary references. (My husband claims he didn't catch a single reference but he laughed heartily throughout anyway.) Sterne's pseudo-scientific explorations are matched with a funny take on Pavlovian comparisons to "Mrs. Shandy"s sexual moods.The score is a delightful pastiche, credited in order of appearance in the opening credits as are the supposedly jealous actors. Many of the selections are from other film scores, such as Fellini movies by Nino Rota, and "Sarabande" by Georg Friedrich Hndel and "Sommarnattens Leende (Smiles of a Summer Night) Galop" by Erik Nordgren for Bergman film references, both directors who have done films about filmmakers.The variety of protean film styles that Winterbottom has done recently is simply astounding. His "24 Hour Party People" is amusingly referred to in passing, even though Jeremy Northram is playing the director, as quite handsome if not all that in control or competent.Warning -- there's quite a number of shots of baby penises - also faithful to the novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exuberant celebration of life; forgiven for '9 Songs'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a good many years after Sterne wrote 'Tristram Shandy' that there appeared a novel as epic and virtuoso, in 'Joyce's 'Ulysses', and a bit longer for Anthony Burgess to take up the baton of typographical/literal word/picture play, with 'The Travellers'. Cinema, since so much of it is created in the cutting room, is the obvious place for mixing realities and metaphors, but this book does not look like the most obvious fodder for a screenplay; which is the reason why Michael Winterbottom and his comrades have done it. For us, the audience, there has been a build-up to this level of dislocation and deconstruction. That the 'unfilmable' Ulysses got up to the screen, for a start. Charlie Kaufman has established himself as the Pirandello of movies with 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation' flowing from his pen, but Winterbottom already got close to leaving the ground with '24 Hour Party People', where the lines between actors and those portrayed, and between the film crew and 'The Film Crew' wobbled about and at the time there was a temptation to add yet another layer of 'reality', although Coogan did say that just might be a step too far. He was smiling as he spoke. Winterbottom's 'Welcome to Sarajevo' has echoes in the scenes where Uncle Toby's (Brydon) obsessively constructed scale model of his battle experience bursts into full-scale action. A brief appearance of Tony Wilson, as 'Tony Wilson', cuts in, a flying shard from Madchester. There are two or three successful translations of the printed page tricks to the screen, but this film's main success is in capturing the sheer exuberant, breathless virtuosity of the book and its celebration of life. Keeley Hawes's performance is every bit as powerful as the part demands; if the birth scene seems overdone, it's worth remembering that in the book, there's a thick wad of pages to wade through before our hero makes his entrance, a trick that Salman Rushdie may have borrowed for The Satanic Verses. Dylan Moran as Doctor Slop manages to exude everywhere an air of pissy inebriety, just by emoting. David Walliams (Curate) and Stephen Fry (Parson Yorick) are here, as they aught to be; it's an English film with a capital E, and so their appearances are obligatory. The catty, vain and snooty behaviour of the two leads may well have been captured while they were unaware the camera was rolling, or it may have been totally scripted, but the journey matters not. It's a big Show Off, and builds towards a pantomime finale through enough sense-battering chaos to fill another forty five minutes. The thing to do then is shout yippee, and head off to the dance.

		<fullReview>When I was a kid, back during the Cleveland administration (second term), whenever a particularly thick, or particularly challenging, book crossed the required-reading list, there was always at least one kid who'd stand up and give a report not on the book but on the difficulties of writing a report on the book.The strategy itself was doomed by its own design, and its result was neither a good introduction to the book nor a good book report in itself.This movie adopts the same strategy, with the same result. Some of the people involved in the production seem to have thought that this was the whole joke of it--but then that may have been a last-ditch attempt at salvage by Stephen Fry, who with Gillian Anderson and the curator who shows us around the real Shandy Hall is the only person who seems to have heard of the book before.And, anyway, Tristram Shandy does make sense: on its own terms, of course, but then what great work of art does not make sense on its own terms.Read the book. It is Mozart in print; so don't worry if at first you cannot follow the plot. By the time you get through it, by the time you get all of the jokes on all of their levels, on all of their levels intertwined, you'll be an educated person. And a very funny one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic witty movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say that this movie is wonderful. It is very smart and a story within a story type movie. But, it's smarter than that. It constantly weaves in and out of the regular book story and the story of the actors and film makers making the movie. The acting is great. Steve Coogan is a genius. As is the co- star. Their chemistry is unbeatable. The film is very funny and demands to be watched more than once. I highly recommend this film. Warning: I've mentioned this some what already, if you are looking for a strict adaptation of the book...Don't watch this. This movie is more of a parody of movie business and a parody of how hard making a movie of the book would be. Some people who came out of the theater were very angry with what they saw. I however, was very pleased. I didn't know what to expect. What I got, was fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should I have been entertained?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sterne's novel delighted me, that's why I decided to go watch the movie in spite of the warnings from friends who saw or heard about it. Aside from a few funny moments, the movie was hard to watch -- a blatant exercise in collective onanism. I am glad I saw it, though, and I do grant the makers the difficulty of their task, i.e. filming a narrative that ought to be recited rather than acted; but what is the pay off? Should I have been entertained? If so, I have completely missed the point. I was bored to tears and kept watching the time. Finally, when the end titles relieved us, I realized I had gone to watch this movie only because, like the people involved in making it, I suppose, I have a profound admiration for Sterne's book. If nothing else, the movie convinced me to read the novel again.</fullReview>

When Woody Allen did it in "Stardust Memories", it was cute and funny.When Steve Coogan does it in "A Cock and Bull Story", it's tired, boring and pointless.Haven't we seen enough self-referential movies about making movies yet? Haven't we seen enough conceited actors and disorganized sets? Why is this supposed to be interesting or funny? It's neither.If you know and love Steve Coogan, perhaps you'd find it funny or engaging, but unless you are a true fan, I doubt you will be impressed. It's another movie where nothing really happens, but unlike Seinfeld, it's not a cute and funny nothing... it's an annoying and tedious nothing. Don't waste your time or money . Fellini does it so much better in 8 1/2 and Woody's homage outclasses and out laughs this one by miles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched for a whole 50 minutes until I walked out, hoping that something will happen. But nothing really happens in this film. This is just a pitiable collection of "jokes" not even kids laugh to.Take for example the scene where the main character's mother is about to give birth. The poor woman is screaming, but the doctor politely accepts the father's offer of a drink. While at first you might grin, the scene goes on and on and on, alternating for 15 minutes or so between the woman in pain and the doctor discussing the details of a particular battle with the father. OK I got it, what's next? Or when the baby is finally delivered, but it is feared that he won't survive. The priest decides to baptise him urgently and the elder daughter is sent to ask the father for a name. Faced with the emergency the father takes his time to think carefully of a right name... Excuse me, was I supposed to laugh? Do yourselves a favour and don't watch it; better have your fingernails pulled out....</fullReview>

WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. Laugh out loud funny? Mildy amusing in only two places does not warrant a comedy label. This is a protracted, painful and just plan boring movie. Coogan and Brydon have so much more to offer, I'd have rather watched the two of them ad-lib over a pint. Half the party viewing with me fell asleep and I was left feeling like an idiot for recommending such drivel. Don't WASTE YOUR TIME. This is overstuffed pompous drivel at its worst. Coogan's foray onto the big movie screen has not been exactly successful- but at least his previous attempts were watchable. I want the 2hrs I wasted watching this back. AVOID.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We enjoyed "24 Hour Party People," but decided to delete this one from our Netflix queue after we watched "The Trip" on streaming (hated it!). Forgot to do that though, and since our next couple of choices turned out to be unavailable?. My wife bailed pretty quickly; the whole mockumentary thing and Steve Coogan's beyond-obnoxious "Steve Coogan" persona were starting to grate a bit?though, in contrast to "The Trip," the childish rivalry between Coogan and Rob Brydon gets to be kind of funny, in a Shandyish, over-the-the-top sort of way. Then about halfway through, when it seems like you're not going to see any more scenes from the book and that things can't get any more aimless and chaotic, the whole project suddenly comes into focus. A Woody Allen?style bit in which the pig-ignorant Coogan hits on a cute film buff by pretending to be a Fassbinder fan suddenly backfires in an interesting, even affecting, way, and a cleverly set-up sight gag makes Coogan literally shrink to Lilliputian size after Brydon nails a romantic scene with goddessy Gillian Anderson. (I guess what it boils down to is that the film becomes quite entertaining when Coogan starts to get his comeuppance. ) The scenes from "Tristram Shandy" that do make it into the final cut certainly reflect the novel's brilliant and exasperating qualities; good work by Shirley Henderson as a careless nursemaid, Naomie Harris as the film-buff PA and Ian Hart as the much-put-upon screenwriter. The contrast between the pampered, narcissistic actors and the obsessive professionalism of the offscreen talent is especially striking?I liked the tireless wardrobe mistress and the Aspie battle-scene coordinator who gives every extra an "authentic" 1695 character name (one of them's "Flee-Fornication Jones" or something like that, obviously a Puritan). Summing up?it may seem like a loser at first, but stay with it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Project that almost Works...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the opening scene, a parody and rip off of Peter Greenaway's 'The Draughtsman's Contract' with its jaunty Elizabethan sounding chamber music and the actors walking around the garden early morning, in period style.Whether the viewer knows of, or even cares about the unfilmable novel they're supposed to be filming is of little matter. The 18th century novel, The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentlemen, seems obscure and impossible to follow, at least as it's presented here. That's because Michael Winterbottom's follow up to his brilliant 24 Hour Party People, but which goes in an as opposite direction as possible, neatly follows the film being made.With the current enthusiasm for period drama, with Downton Abbey et al, this is specially pertinent. And with recent TV half-hour comedies, we know that Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon make very comfortable comedic bed- fellows, with impersonating banter and sparring off each other and here, they do just that - and it's great. A whole host of almost every known face in U.K. TV comedy kingdom are somehow dropping in their comments and gags, usually pertinent to the film, some not.As I said, for most, the actual narrative elements of the novel being filmed quickly take a back seat and attempts to associate scenes with those and what they mean just gets hazy and confusing. So, for us mere mortals, we don't care whether Coogan, as actual modern Steve Coogan is a fictionalised version of the original Tristram Shandy and so the domestic scenes become dreary. We don't really need to see babies being put to bed, do we?This was my second viewing, on BBC2 and it was still interesting. As a mockumentary, a semi-serious send up of that so very British Institution, the period drama it works well, as does the loosely-written comedic interludes. Though the critics may cringe and disagree (they liked this film), it's probably too clever for its own good but I'm quite comfortable thinking that I'm enjoying a film that the literary dons do, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps Michael Winterbottom considered 'A Shaggy Dog Story', with all those connotations of a winding narrative that has little to do with its own conclusion. But then A Cock And Bull Story, for all its fourth wall assault and self-parodic expansion of the plot (the birth of a child also becomes the birth of the film) ultimately does amount to something.The film as object jumps in and out of focus, confusion our idea of exactly what it is. Opening with Coogan and Brydon in makeup preparing for the film within, the next shot is of Coogan addressing the (cinema) audience. This negation of the fourth wall comes at the end of a title sequence using music written (by Michael Nyman) for a different film. In addition to hopping across the diegesis, there is even a sequence in which the music is referred to as Bach - although the music is clearly by Johann Christian Bach ('fifty years out of period!' as a scandalised consultant notes elsewhere). As in the film there is obfuscation between father and son.The interviews that plague Coogan as he tries to make his way across the set are both entirely real. One, with the late Tony Wilson whom Coogan has played on screen, concerns another screen persona of Coogan (Partridge) and is actually available as a DVD extra - we know as its mentioned during the film. This is the depth of layering that Winterbottom's re-working dives to, showing within the film itself the self-perpetuating pretence that film-making incorporates.Thus is the metaphor drawn and the birth of the child shown to be as random - but rich - and outcome as the production of a film. I love the underscoring of key sequences with (the central part of) of Schumann's Piano Quintet, expressive, celebratory romantic music, rather than the halting, didactic funeral march music either side of it.More than most other films this one requires not only good acting but some sort of personal sacrifice from the cast, playing roles but also a version of themselves. The whole thing is couched in an already dated mid-Noughties humour, a sort of short-delay postmodernism. I think Winterbottom manages to get just the right level of this from most in the cast. It's a wonderful, if confusing, even slight film. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the Technical side: a rare success for video shooting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If few of us watching Tristram Shandy were aware that the film was shot on video and not film, this is because the content may have been carefully chosen to help us go on the journey and forget the look of the movie.We associate the film medium with the movies and we tend to suspend our disbelief accordingly. When we see video, (even hi-definition video) we associate the content with documentary.It's all in the grey matter. Video can be as good as film - even better - but it has yet to help us dream the way film does. Successive attempts to do so have lost money, which is why, once a producers have hired actors, caterers, etc, etc then they might as well pay the little extra for the box-office guarantee that film provides.Tristram Shandy, in the tradition of the Russian Ark (2002), combines dramatic content, sumptuous costumes and classical decor with an alternately journalistic style complete with presenter, unsteady hand-held camera and almost a reality TV insight into the film-making world.The trick of using just enough documentary content to woo our subconscious into accepting HD video as a drama medium for the movies got me - hook, line and sinker! In terms of our evolution from film media into a purely digital one, Tristram Shandy is a significant milestone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is fascinatingly anarchic meditation on the process of film-making just as Sterne's masterpiece is a fascinatingly anarchic meditation on the process of writing. It hooked me immediately, and though I only laughed three or four times while watching, I found myself laughing to myself for the next few days and wanting to watch it again. A good sign. I'll rent the DVD. The more I think about it, the better it gets. The only irritating aspect for me was the muddled rom-com flirtation between Coogan and one of the crew: not in the spirit of Sterne and unnecessary. I keep looking for thematic and stylistic unity in Winterbottom's diverse work, and I think I may be getting there: there seems a concern with realism as a concept: hence the straight neo-realist docu-drama of In This World (his masterpiece, I think), the self-reflexive attempt to recreate the Manchester music scene in 24 Hour Party People, the real sex in 9 Songs...

		<shortDescription>Film has it's points, but it isn't for everyone. Gillain fans may be disappointed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several viewer caveats are in order here. First off, don't let the title of the movie intimidate or mislead you. Knowledge of 18th Century English literature is by no means a prerequisite for approaching this production. Matter of fact, the fewer preconceptions you have, the better off you probably are. Which is to say, if you're expecting to see an earnest, straightforward adaptation of Lawrence Stern's novel, you will be sadly disappointed. That's because "Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story" has less to do with the actual drama than it does with the filming of this allegedly "unfilmable" work, and all the vain goings-on among the cast and crew on and off the set. Therein lies the crux of this elaborate, Python-esquire joke, if you will. Those of you with a grasp of the absurd, especially if you have a fondness for British humor, will probably not find the film's running time of 94 minutes too frightfully long. Those who don't may wish to bail out of this bad boy after the first half-hour, or sooner.Second, if your sole purpose in checking out this movie is to see Gillian Anderson, be advised that there isn't nearly enough of her to make the experience worth your while. As always, she's delightful to watch, playing both herself and the character of Widow Wadman in the drama (leaping effortlessly from an American dialect to British, then back again). Like the movie itself (or, I should say, the movie within the movie), she leaves you wanting more. The actress is definitely under employed here?I dare say, she's wasted in this enterprise. Then again, the very fact that she IS wasted is, in itself, part of the overall "joke." So in a sense, she really is NOT wasted. (Huh???) The only way make to sense of this ironic riddle is to see her within the context of the entire movie. If, at the end, you still don't "get it," if you fail to see the "point" of this movie relax; you're probably not the only one.My advice to those die-hard Gillian fans out there, who might resent wading through an hour's worth of shallow, convoluted "batter" to savor about 7 minutes worth of tasty content: I suggest you skip the PLAY button on your DVD menu, and click on the SCENE SELECTION button instead; find the two or three scenes she's in, watch them and discard the rest. Then you can pop in a tape of your favorite X-Files episode and bide your time until "Last King of Scotland" is released in theaters this Fall.The non-Gillian cast is uniformly top-notch. Certain viewers may feel that the principals (Steve Coogan, Rob Brydon, and company) were more entertaining portraying the characters in Stern's novel than they were playing/being themselves. Again, that's a question of personal disposition.For the record, I did not dislike the film. I actually found it quite a hoot (pardon the Americanism) and I'm not at all sorry that I stuck it out to the end. Neither is my wife, which is surprising since she usually hasn't much patience for cinematic oddities such as this. She would have been much happier, however, without the sudden eruption of obscenities that took place in a couple of scenes, somewhat late into the film?which, I don't mind telling you, added not a thing to what was, until then, a virtually (98 percent) F-free script."Tristram Shandy" isn't everyone's cup of mocha. It's not a film I'd recommend to someone whose tastes I didn't already know. On the one hand, the phrase, "Cock and Bull Story," summarizes the film quite aptly. Then again, you would do well to read several other commentaries to gain a fuller, more informed appreciation for what the film is endeavoring to accomplish?or whether, in fact, it accomplishes anything at all.The movie may not go anyplace, but it does have fun getting there, in a rambling, off-the-wall sort of way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Cock and Bull Story is a mockumentary imitating work on the set of a film based on a novel which is virtually impossible to adapt. The film is not so laughable as I expected. Whilst the movie is abound with wonderful, at times highly abstract ideas, some of them are not very amusing. However, they always provide wise entertainment. The English humour which is used is unusual and original, but not always penetrable for an average viewer. Therefore, Tristram Shandy works better as a documentation of work on the set and problems connected with all the stages of film production. From these aspects numerous funny situations stem. The flick also openly jeers at stardom and situational humour is frequently implemented. What deserves attention is a realization of the film. Winterbottom is not afraid to superimpose pictures, shoot at hand or apply brave staging ideas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies about movie-making is often too filled with internal jokes to really amuse an audience. Or if the jokes aren't internal, there still is a risk that the audience is kept outside somehow.That's exactly what happens here, but you buy it anyway, because Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon are really funny in a way that's very dry and "British". The story is anyway too short. One has a feeling that this production has been made a little out of the film company's mercy. They have got 1,5 hour and not a minute more. Everything feels a little hasty.It's not entertaining all the time, but there are still lots of sarcasms towards acting, directors and a movie crew, which seems much to large. It's OK, but not more than so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film about acting, but unsatisfying for ordinary folks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedy (British). Rated R, based on a good number of sex scenes, an Al Pacino imitation, and ongoing discussion of injuries to male private parts. Also the hero is depicted nude inside a giant model womb.Only perhaps 10% of this film attempts (with varying degrees of seriousness) to enact scenes from the "unfilmable" classic novel "The Life and Opinions of Tristam Shandy, gent." (by Laurence Sterne, 1767). Rather it is an Altman-like parody of the whole Masterpiece Theater / Merchant Ivory historical film genre, which it deconstructs in a Monty Python / Tom Stoppard / Woody Allen-like manner.Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon deliver a good number of funny bits, some of which have you laughing on the way home, but the film is mainly about the behind-the-scenes politics, struggles, failures, and chaos of low-budget indie film-making: the writers and producers constantly changing the script, the actors' rivalry for credit and screen time, the pressure from girlfriends, agents and gossip writers, scenes bombing or being cut, and so on.The big problem, in my opinion, is that the filmmakers don't deliver ANY continuity of the underlying film. We see all the cooks in the kitchen, stirring the pots, but at the end they don't serve up a plausible sequence of "Tristam" scenes, to make it look like something artistically valid was achieved. The viewer is left to assemble the out-of-order takes in his or her own mind. They could have easily delivered a "happy ending" wherein, out of all this confusion, their picture had integrity and was a success, but they don't. It just fizzles out into a kind of nihilist theater of the absurd.The foregoing, coupled with "British style humor," is sufficiently unsatisfying that I would not recommend this film for the general viewer. However, for anyone involved with the world of acting and film-making it's a must-see, a wonderful, satirical portrayal of what it's really like to make and star in an independent historical drama. A real "actor's film." Two days later: Watching this film is like viewing the "making of" and "out-takes" sections of a modern DVD, without the actual movie! Eleven days later: Here's an idea. Take some other unfilmable historical novel and make a similar comedy, with lots of behind-the-scenes, making-of, and out-take segments, except while you're at it, shoot a random sample of a dozen or so (i.e., not 120) dead serious, high quality, Masterpiece Theatre-type scenes. When you're done mocking everyone, flash through bits of these in the viewing room, and then at a film festival, showing the audience weeping and giving it a standing ovation! Thus you can depict that your adaptation was a thunderous success, and send everyone home happy and satisfied, without making any actual effort to adapt that old piece of garbage. Got it??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unreadable Book, an Unfilmable Movie, an Impossible Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It starts with Laurence Sterne's 1767 novel "The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman," a notoriously hard book to read. The story is full of digressions. (For example, Tristram, the title character/narrator isn't even born until the book is more than half over!) Many have speculated that the absurd novel would be impossible to adapt into a movie. Director Michael Winterbottom took up the challenge, and came up with the high-concept "Tristram Shandy: A Cock &amp; Bull Story." He took a satirical approach: about twenty minutes of the movie is devoted to scenes from the book. Then the movie digresses from the story entirely, and goes behind the scenes to the making of the "Tristram Shandy" movie. Then it becomes a movie about making a movie adapted from a book about writing a book! The best explanation for the roundabout nature of the movie (and the book) is best explained by Patrick Curator, played by Stephen Fry: in the book, Tristram Shandy tries to write his life story, but it keeps getting away from him. This symbolizes that life is filled with distractions and complications. Steve Coogan stars as Tristram Shandy, as well as his father, Walter Shandy, plus a fictionalized version of himself. He plays his own persona as a frustrated star, dealing with a girlfriend and baby, filming hardships, a few scandals, and the thought of his co-star, Rob Brydon, getting more screen time than him. The story might be hard to follow, but it fits with the original source material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I'd never read The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, I found Michael Winterbottom's film to be entertaining and hilarious. I was a big fan of 24 Hour Party people. Once again, Steve Coogan, fantastic as always, does a great job in a multi-layered role as; himself, Tristram and the father. There are some great supporting roles, but Kelly Macdonald was underused. While the film bounces between the sequences of the film and the crew making it, It falls victim to some uneven pacing but all in all, It was a good time.Tristram Shandy lies between Sweet Liberty, Mike Figgis' Hotel and a Peter Greenaway Film (mostly cause of the costumes and Nyman's musical score). This film is worth catching if it plays in your town.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very unique -- it probably helps to be a fan of British humor and perhaps a film industry insider. Don't be put off by thinking this is an old period piece with extravagant costumes and manicured English estates. It is a comedy about movie-making and movie-makers that twists and shifts repeatedly. The viewer won't get lost but some rich material may fly past unnoticed. Good performances from a fine cast. You will never read the end credits because they roll beside a hilarious verbal duel featuring stars Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon. Fans of these two should search the BBC Internet site to find some great amusements. If you like Tristan Shandy, look at 24-Hour Party People, a film from the same Director and Writer of Tristram Shandy and starring Steve Coogan.</fullReview>

The question comes to mind: "do I have to read the book before I see the film?" The answer should be no. Unfortunately, in the case of this film which is so full of smarmy inside jokes, the only way you're going to fully appreciate it is to do a substantial amount of research about Tristram and about Coogan and co. The problem is that it's not worth it. That being said, if you're already a fan of this troupe then you will really enjoy it. That's why this film is rated a ten by so many people and it's also rated a one by lots of people. If you're not already a big fan of these guys wait for it to hit the rental/HBO/etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How do you film the unfilmable?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Answer: You don't. You film the 'filming' of the unfilmable. The initial statement has to be made that I am a fan of the smart and hilarious book by Laurence Sterne, but you cannot approach this film as an adaptation or you will be disappointed. In its own genius way, as brilliantly written as it is by screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce (probably my pick for most under-appreciated screenwriter currently working), the film captures much of the cheeky spirit of the novel.Steve Coogan is perfect for this role, although perhaps not as obviously right for it as he was for Tony Wilson in Winterbottom's (and Boyce's) masterpiece "24 Hour Party People". That film shares much in common with "Tristam Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story", most obviously the fact that both films break the fourth wall ("24 Hour Party People" does it more directly, admittedly).One needs to approach this film with basically no prior expectations to like it, really. It's a unique film, and perhaps an acquired taste, but I imagine it helps if you're not expecting anything particular from it. There's no point in talking about the film in more detail- just see it for yourself.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film for our times. I haven't read the book, but folks, you've seen enough films. You know, at least to some degree, about the egos and studio politics which sometimes make for contentious or eventful shoots. You can follow this film. I've read enough reviews on this site saying that you should be of a certain character or intelligence or what-not to enjoy this film. Anyway..don't believe the hype. This is a brilliant film. All you need to know is that this film breaks the third wall. I've seen films, such as Monty Python's Holy Grail, The Opposite of Sex with Christina Ricci, and of course, TV shows such as Malcolm in the Middle, Arrested Development, and The Bernie Mac Show in which characters address the screen. That said, this is a lot more complex than those features really. The filmmakers, Winterbottom and Coogan trust their audience to go with them and humor their desires to tweak traditional storytelling narratives. That is to say, the action veers from behind the scenes of the making of a movie to in front of the camera at will. This book is apparently notoriously difficult to adapt and so Coogan and Winterbottom have thrown up their hands and said, OK, we'll make a movie as chaotic and anarchic as the book. All you need to know is that the star (Steve Coogan, is he Shandy or is he Coogan? Or Coogan as Shandy? Or Coogan as Shandy as Coogan? Or Coogan as Shandy as Coogan as Shandy? Or Coogan as Shandy as Coogan as Shandy as Coogan as Shandy as Coogan?) Don't worry about all that. Just know that Coogan has the reputation of a narcissistic egomaniac which might be somewhat mingled with his portrayal of a Larry Sanders show type fake talk-show host so that the boundaries of Steve Coogan's personality blur with the boundaries of Alan Partridge, the faux talk-show host's character and make for a wonderful messy, complex film. He is difficult to decipher and his history of depicting characters from in faux-real shows have blurred the lines of his personality. This makes riffing on who he is even more fun. One doesn't know what is real and what isn't. In fact, at first I wondered whether the actor who plays his "real life" wife in the movie was indeed his real wife. Of course I was disabused of that notion within a short time as I realized that this was something of a mockumentary. Still and all, just know that the film will provide you enough information about the basics of the book that you can understand why certain things happen, how his Uncle Toby's war injury is a recurring joke, and that beyond that, the film is a parody of studio politics, of actors' public personas, and their insecurities. I particularly enjoyed Bryden and his opening conversation with Coogan about the sizes of their noses and their roles in the film. Bryden is a wonderfully dry counterpoint to Coogan's supposed egomania and I also thought that Coogan's "real life" wife in the film was also a nice ballast to keep the film from veering too far into surreality. As some of his compadres said during a break from filming, she kept him grounded. That said, game, capable performances from an array of excellent British actors and most credit goes to the director for imagining such an innovative take on a novel that was post-modern before its time. I'm going to have to read the book now....right after I start Ulysses for the 8th time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not read the novel, but I read good things about the film, so I rented it a while back. I found it to be hilarious, with nonstop, side-splitting banter between the two leads throughout. The DVD commentary is very good too, as the cast deconstructs the deconstruction of the non-film within a film, if you get my meaning. I have not seen Coogan's other work, so I can not say if this role is typical for him. Rob Brydon is a master of sly comic timing, he really holds his own with Coogan. I plan to seek out more of their work. The humor is very British, and may not be to all tastes. Far, far better than what passes for comedy in the US these days (except "Beerfest").

		<fullReview>Hailed as one of the best films shown at the 2005 New York Film Festival (and the year) it took me almost a year and a half to see it. Now that I have a wave of disappointment rolls in. Don't get me wrong this is a funny movie but the love and adulation poured at the feet of this film at the film festival seems more directed at the idea of the film rather than the film itself.The movie is essentially a film about the making of a film based on Tristram Shandy, an unfilmable novel (which I doubt many people know as anything other than by reputation). After an opening bit with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon in the makeup chair the film switches to 25 minutes of uninterrupted adaptation from the book. Absolutely hysterical and spot on (with Dylan Moran a pure delight as a doctor with his stereotypical personality- would you want him to deliver your baby?).I think Michael Winterbottom and crew make a good run at proving that in the right hands the book could be filmed.Then suddenly the film shifts gears and we are pulled back into the film-making experience as the fourth wall is broken and the film becomes a film about the making of the film. It was here that the film broke down for me. Certainly a good deal of it is funny in a very dry sort of way, but more often than not they are funny in a cerebral sort of way and not a laugh out loud sort of way. While I don't mind admiring a joke I'd rather laugh at it. Much of the last two thirds were like that for me, I admired what it was trying to do, but I didn't really have anything other than an intellectual experience. (I also was not thrilled that a movie this intelligent often went in directions that were very predictable. Maybe I've seen one too many behind the scenes comedies) This isn't to say that the movie is bad, its not. Its a very good little film. Its just not the be all and end all that many reviewers said it would be. Maybe a second viewing will improve it.recommended for those who like dry British humor or very clever movies that aren't as funny as they think they are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So good I read the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know a great deal about Tristram Shandy before watching A Cock And Bull Story. Perhaps this is a good thing; lovers of the book may well not enjoy this film as it covers only a very few episodes from what is a very long book, distorts some of them, adds others such as extensive sequences of Tristram in the womb which do not feature in the book, and then devotes over half its length to being a documentary on the making of the film 'Tristram Shandy,' which itself then branches off into apparently unrelated behind the scenes goings on.However, consider the book 'The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman.' It starts reasonably enough with Tristram Shandy's conception - but doesn't reach his birth until almost five hundred pages later as the author (supposedly Tristram himself) finds he needs to go further back in time as each event he describes has a preceding cause which he feels also needs explanation. He gets distracted and branches off into apparently unrelated stories. He sends a woman reader back to re-read a preceding chapter for having missed a detail which only an expert theologian would have noticed. He justifies one long digression by saying that the hour and a half spent reading it will have accounted for the time taken by Obadiah going to fetch Doctor Slop from his distant house and bring him back.... and then informs us that the Doctor happened to be just outside and the two returned almost immediately - and takes another dozen or so pages telling us so.How should or could you possibly film such a book? It contains very little of what might be called a story; only isolated episodes decidedly not in chronological order. Many of these are in the film where they are just as disjointed as the book. It contains digression upon digression - well, the film certainly has these. Much of the book (despite the title) is taken over by Walter Shandy's rather forceful opinions, much of the film by Steve Coogan's. The book deliberately does not conform to any literary conventions. The film is probably not as unconventional as the book, but film is over 100 years old today and has often been experimented with; Tristram Shandy being the number eight novel in chronological order is not too far from the mark.'A Cock And Bull Story' is not really a film of 'The Life And Opinions Of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman,' but then it doesn't claim to be and wisely doesn't share the same title. The title of the film comes from the final lines of the novel which I think capture it perfectly: "L--d! said my mother, what is all this story about? ----"'A C O C K and a B U L L,' said Yorick ---- And one of the best of its kind, I ever heard."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Cock and Bull StoryHaving really enjoyed Winterbottom's 24hr Party People and the classic movie about making a movie, Lost in LaMancha, I was really looking forward to A Cock and Bull Story ? and on the whole it lived up to expectations, but it never really exceeded them. Steve Coogan managed to come across as completely unsympathetic, but this is nothing new ? indeed he has made a career of it. Rob Brydon was a revelation to me ? I thought he was great, but he did have the more sympathetic 'lead' role of the two of them. It was also good to see Naomie Harris from 28 Days Later and Benedict Wong from 15 Storeys High, getting some screen time.The plot within a plot device worked pretty well on the whole and built on a strength of 24hr Party People which was rather underexploited ? Coogan speaking to camera. But where Lost in LaMancha was the tale of a team of people with a vision, battling the odds to create a masterpiece ? Cock and Bull portrayed the crew as a bunch of chancers who had no idea what they were attempting to do. Perhaps this is a true reflection of the cottage industry approach to film-making in the UK in contrast to the corporate goal-based approach of Hollywood productions.All in all Cock and Bull was a very polished in-joke for media types. Certainly the audience in the Electric Cinema in Portobello Road were bang on the demographic. But Winterbottom, Coogan, Brydon et al are talented folk and are able to reach out to a larger audience, and as a result this felt rather self-indulgent and a squandering of talent.</fullReview>

If it was made with eyes wide open and written, to begin with, as a post-modern comment on the nature of it's subject; as well as it's stars then fantastic. I do wonder though; it reminded me a lot of Adaptation a film about an unfilmable novel which became a film about adapting an unfilmable novel. I think it's possible that everything that was a negative about filming the book became a positive in the new version. The budget, or lack of, for the battle scene; financial pressure to have a big star.Anyway regardless of any clever post modern devices; the film was hilarious.

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Director Michael Winterbottom follows actors Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon around as they attempt to film the essentially unfilmable novel The Opinions of Tristram Shandy. An uneasy task is made harder by things going wrong and creative egos getting in the way.This is one of those comedies that wants to be really big and clever and the novelty is never lost as the film goes on. I've always liked Steve Coogan and he wasn't stepping out of his depth by trying to make a film like this. But by and large this film sadly doesn't work. The plot has a lot of interesting angles to explore but it plays out with no cohesion or narrative and hasn't come together well as a script at all. A lot of the jokes fail to hit the mark as well, with only Coogan's black female assistant providing some of the memorably funny moments. Recognizable TV comics, including Dylan Moran, David Walliams and Jeremy Northam are trotted out by the bucketload in an effort to brighten things up but change nothing. Sadly this emerges as just another example of Coogan's work coming off better on the small screen than on the big one. **</fullReview>

And I'm enjoying it almost as much as the movie. I think I understand Sterne's purpose. The act of creating is itself action.

		<shortDescription>"A-Ha!" (Sorry Steve!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film within a film is yet another diverse offering from director Michael Winterbottom, who seems to refuse to do the conventional these days. Following Code 46, an intellectual science fiction film, and an essentially pornographic romance story with 9 Songs, two films that didn't go down too well, Winterbottom strikes gold by re-teaming with his leading man from 24 Hr Party People, Steve Coogan. Here he creates an amusing, interesting and intelligent satire of the British period epic, and shows the attempts of a crew of filmmakers trying to film the un-filmable book, The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, by Laurence Sterne. It's a book no-one would have dared to attempt filming because it's almost unreadable let alone transferring it successfully and understandably to film. Here Coogan plays himself, playing the lead role of Trsitram Shandy.The flits between segments from the movie and then from real moments behind the scenes. Some have used the term documentary, but these scenes are not done in documentary style, it feels that way because it's almost voyeuristic. However it does have that feeling of Spinal Tap about it. The film also brilliantly sends up Coogan's own real life image, of a wild boy trying to reign himself into being a family man, and Coogan is quite willing to make a fool of himself here (he is accused in the story of engaging in bizarre sex acts with a lap dancer). Coogan plays himself as a man with a bit of an ego and something to prove as an actor and also a family man, and someone who hates the mere mention of his most famous creation, Alan Partridge, as people take delight in doing impressions of him and bellowing out "ah-ha!" Coogan gives a very good performance, adding a dimension to his acting and playing not merely for laughs.Joining Coogan are a who's who of British acting talent making cameos, to supporting roles with Naomi Harris, Keeley Hawes, Shirly Henderson, Dylan Moran, Jeremy Northam, Mark Williams, James Fleet, Mark Williams and Ronni Ancona. Gillian Anderson also appears as herself. However the star here is Coogan's friend, and occasional co-star, Rob Brydon, whose stock will most definitely rise following this film. Brydon is almost a peripheral figure in the piece and that is one of my few complaints. When Brydon appears he clearly gets on Steve's nerves, for the simple reason he is taking focus away from him. The chemistry between the two is excellent with comical bickering and Brydon delights us by giving several superb impressions of Coogan, as well as impressions of Al Pacino. This film runs off Coogan and also off Brydon, these two keep the film ticking.This film while intelligent is also hilarious at times. There are some classic comedy scenes here, from Coogan's impression of a boy who's just damaged his penis, to himself with a hot chestnut down his trousers. Not to mention the sight of Coogan suspended upside down in a giant replica womb! Brydon also delights with his almost Woody Allenesque neuroses regarding the casting of Gillian Anderson, late on into the movies production. This is because Anderson is Brydon's number one fantasy woman, and the fact he has posters of her on his wall and all the X-files on DVD.This is essential British cinema and a good start to the year for my cinema viewing pleasure. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Approach To A Genuinely Unfilmable Novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed 'A Cock And Bull Story'. Sterne's 'Tristram Shandy' is, as is continually noted in the movie, pretty much unfilmable, and the digressional, episodic structure of the film-within-a-film format ? while not a shadow of old Larry's comic masterpiece (one of the few texts genuinely worthy of the term) ? captures the essence of his quixotic wit. In the novel our titular hero segues from anecdote to anecdote, furnishing his back-story and supporting cast with so much detail that he never getting past the incident of his birth ? the consequence being that the story of the 'Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy' never gets started. Here there's so much banter about who billing, stature, shoe-size, excisions and additions to the script and other (rather more satirical, with regard to the film industry) interruptions that most of the story the writer and director set out to tell are excluded. We end, fittingly enough, with the screening of Tristram's birth scene to the befuddled cast and crew. The promise, via voice-over, in one scene that more footage will be available when the film is released on DVD is a further knowing nod to the spirit of the deeply digressional source novel.Steve Coogan, as himself/Squire Shandy sends himself up quite royally, ably assisted by the (far funnier) Rob Brydon, and I do think it would be a great shame if this pair don't work together again. Their professional association is well known, and Coogan (in some senses the Welshman's mentor) has made cameo appearances in 'Marion and Geoff', but an effective comedy duo on the big screen is something British cinema has lacked for a long long time?and Coogan makes a surprisingly good straight-man. Their over-the-credits ramble about who does the better Al Pacino impression made me laugh out loud. Rare in the cinema.The supporting turns are very good. Too many to mention, really, as the film's cast list is like a 'Spotlight' supplement. Kelly MacDonald is nicely understated as Coogan's girlfriend, and Shirley Henderson strops quite nicely. Keeley Hawes looks lovely as Tris's mum, and, being Keeley Hawes, even manages to get her kit off unnecessarily in one scene. After remaining fully clothed in the BBC's recent 'Macbeth' she probably felt she had to?just to preserve her reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastically funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading other reviews here at IMDb I am staggered at how polarising this film has proved to be. 'A Cock and Bull Story' was one of the most brilliantly-managed funny films I have seen in a long time. And like all good comedies, the film also had pathos and heart.The disjunctured, non-linear narrative was an apt adaptive style for Sterne's masterpiece allowing for the digressive qualities that make up the original. The conceit in this case - the analysis of the meta-textual film-making process, in conjunction with the 'adapters' re-creation of the source - was ideally suited to the material. In addition, we had a separate textual narrative in play, the narrative of Steve Coogan (as Steve Coogan)'s own confused and digressive life. In this sense the film played pitch perfectly to both needs - the process of text-to-screen adaptation itself (with an intelligent twist), and, most aptly, afforded additional modern relevance by utilising modern-day obsession with celebrity culture, the drive towards self- narrativisation, to express the key tenets of Sterne's original story - how each life is ongoing, unmanageable, shifting, mutable, haphazard. Sterne's text effectively prefigures postmodern ideas of intertextuality, reality is slippery, unfixed - to the point where no narrative, no story of a life, can ever be truly or truthfully related. Winterbottom's response, however, is far from disorganised - this is tightly controlled stuff masquerading as loose and ramshackle. There are clear points the film aims to put across, including the impossibility of closure, man's relentless ego, hence we have a radio news broadcast at one point reminding us of the interminable nature of the war in Iraq, and the dubious fate of terror suspects. This is a sharp reminder of how our inability to manage and control our own personal narratives and our self-presentation, has extended beyond ourselves - we create and participate in a bigger picture which is unruly, reckless, unmanageable, prone to digression, subject to ego. By the same token, the presence of Coogan's baby, his realisation that being close to the mother of his child - even if it is only for then, that moment - is necessary, warm and comforting. Even the Tristram Shandy story can only resolve itself by reaching the point of childbirth - the delivery of a new life into this chaotic world - a baby who will become the confused and confusing (yet utterly realistic) Tristram Shandy. Life goes on regardless.Seriousness aside - thankfully - 'A Cock and Bull Story' does just that; ensures seriousness is constantly put aside. Po-faced comments on postmodern textuality (not too far removed from what has been written in this review) are delivered deadpan by Coogan, to be laughed at and ridiculed. Stephen Fry's small role as the curator of Shandy Hall tells us in mockumentary style what Sterne was writing about, and why - and indeed, what he tells us, goes straight to the heart of the matter, but is rendered humorous by Fry's comic old bluffer mode of acting. The pretentious twaddle spoken by Coogan's sexy production assistant Jenny (a splendid Naomie Harris here) is debunked at the end of the film by her 'real-life' shallow twaddle, discussing her pay-as-you-go mobile phone.Acting performances are strong, multi-layered, interesting. Steve Coogan is fabulous as the loathsome yet pitiful Steve Coogan - a brilliant piece of acting as he brings a sneaking sadness to the role, a quiet desperation behind the ebullient point-scoring with Rob Brydon. His final concession of (self)-defeat - allowing his and Brydon's shoes to go unchanged - is a wonderful, underplayed moment; effectively the climax for his character's development within the narrative arc (what there is of one) within this film. Rob Brydon as Brydon-Uncle Toby is simply superb here - granted, he has the funnier, more sympathetic role, but he is still something of a scene-stealer (although, 'Coogan' would be happy to know that it is still 'Coogan' who is very much the lead star). Again, Brydon brings humour, comic banter, but also a slight sadness and even a faint anger at Coogan's comparative celebrity, which underlines his performance with the requisite depth and interest it would need. There are flawless performances throughout the highly talented supporting cast - including Jeremy Northam as the twitchy, uncertain director, Kelly Macdonald as the sweet, tolerant girlfriend, Naomie Harris as the earnest production assistant, Gillian Anderson as the imported glamour, James Fleet as the star-struck producer, Shirley Henderson as the cryptically comic maid, Dylan Moran as the drunken doctor, Keeley Hawes as the poor benighted mother, constantly in painful labour, and Mark Williams as the over-enthusiastic historical battles expert.In sum, a smart, funny and strongly-acted piece of work. It is unlikely to be a widely accessible film by virtue of its deliberately contrived media parochialism - you need a degree of prior knowledge in Coogan's work and comic personas for example. Also, the appearance of David Walliams as the curate prompted an automatic snigger at my cinema viewing, because of the current popularity of Little Britain. This film seems to be trying to make a pseudo-pretentious point about postmodernism, offering a seemingly shambolic, made-up, impromptu, disconnected sort of narrative, which is then debunked by the over-arching reality that this film is actually tightly-controlled, ultimately on-message and a surprisingly streamlined narrative, (while pretending to be otherwise) - indeed, this (perhaps) is the real point the film is making about postmodernism itself - Postmodernism as ironic messiness, as style over substance, as witting sham. Yet, the film has enough heart to ensure it never becomes too weighty or laboured.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easy watching, uneventful 'film'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Winterbottom attempts to film an unfilmable book and achieves this by including very little of the book in this expensive-looking featurette.While easy to watch, the main point of irk for me is that this is not like a film at all but more of a backstage documentary that would appear as on extra on most DVD's for 'proper' films.I'm not at all sure what the point of this film was, sickeningly self-indulgent, Winterbottom seems to have hired his favourite comedians, past &amp; present, and stuck them on a film set and filmed them doing bugger all.50% of the film is Steve Coogan, the rest is a mix of Rob Brydon taking the mick out of Coogan, occasional scenarios from the book it was apparently based on, pointless scenes of fake interviews with, yet again, Coogan and re-enactments of on-set production meetings.What destroys this film totally is we are constantly reminded the battle scene was never included because it simply "wasn't funny"?but neither is the rest of this glossy featurette.Winterbottom's lingering shots of Ashley Jensen had me thinking they must be dating as there is no other reason for an extended close up of a character after they have finished speaking.The over-use of Alan Partridge 'jokes' lead me to think they were trying to induce a Coogan/Partridge comeback, a thought I confirmed by checking IMDb after watching the featurette and discovering there is an Alan Partridge movie in pre production.Blatantly a directionless director with too much freedom, Winterbottom needs to think about what the hell his intentions were when he made this film, as at the moment it comes across as a dewy-eyed fan featurette of British comedians and little else.</fullReview>

I left the theater after 30 minutes to find others in the lobby waiting for friends and relatives to bail out of a really bad movie.Here's the joke (save your money): the novel isn't about anything at all and (this is the wildly creative part) the movie is about how hard it is to film nothing at all. The acting is bad, the script is ridiculous and the storyline nonexistent. If you want British humor, watch the Best of Monty Python on PBS Wednesdays. Cheers!</fullReview>

Comedy is a word that i use lightly here for this, as the laughs are few and far between, and if like me you have not watched much of Steve Coogan's TV Shows or any of the other raft of comedy programs on the BBC then you won't get the jokes most people seemed to laugh at.A poor effort,disappointing where even the lovely Kelly McDonald couldn't even bring the film up to scratch for me.

		<shortDescription>A brilliantly complicated, simply funny comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're not familiar with Steve Coogan and his work as Alan Partridge you're going to be disappointed. If you're only familiar with Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge you're going to be disappointed. Steve Coogan plays himself brilliantly, perfectly in fact. The petty disputes of an actor, about something so mundane such as the height of his shoes ("It's an issue of status") are expertly portrayed, whilst anyone watching this really feels the irritation of being pigeon-holed as a one character man (most people who interact with Coogan as Coogan in this film seem to think he actually is Alan Partridge).The film's plot is truly anarchic, but this is entirely intentional, and as ironic as it may seem this anarchy is beautifully orchestrated. The book of Tristram Shandy, that the film within the film is based upon, sets out to tell the life of events of Shandy, however through continuous distraction and procrastination never gets further than his birth. This is addressed in the film as well, but the characters themselves are all distracted and procrastinate as well...this is a the film of a film of a book, which is all loosely based upon the same book!In terms of actual comedy this film is hilarious. There's great physical comedy (Coogan, a hot chestnut, the genital region), there's superb character interaction and there's just a comedic genius in the obnoxiousness of Steve Coogan as Steve Coogan.The show-stealer, without a doubt, is Rob Brydon. His impressions are spot on (of Steve Coogan/Al Pacino/Roger Moore) and he is funny as the 'modest' Uncle Toby and as himself. The chemistry between Coogan and Brydon is spot-on, with totally improvised opening shots and closing shots.David Walliams, Mark Williams, Stephen Fry and Dylan Moran all have memorable bit parts. Mark Williams is especially funny as the historical adviser ("What did you think of Cold Mountain's battle scenes.....SH*TE!") and for those who know Dylan Moran as himself can enjoy his last line (Q"How many drinks do you have a day?" DM "...er..a number....").It isn't the fantastic acting or simply the comedy that made this film so enjoyable, however, it was the story it told. Coogan is an insecure, unfaithful and utterly self-centered brat in the beginning. Yet when, like Walter Shandy does in the book, he realises that however much you try to plan something, control life, it makes no difference it will always lead it's own anarchic path. Only after discovering this does he find peace, his libido and the film feels naturally resolved.Tristram Shandy: A Cock &amp; Bull Story is laugh out loud funny and I really would recommend anyone who's interested in film or comedy to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie about the making of a movie and the movie in question is "Tristram Shandy", the novel they said was unfilmable and which isn't filmed here. It begins like a deconstruction of the novel in filmic terms, part Tony Richardson's "Tom Jones" and part Karel Reisz's version of "The French Lieutenant's Woman" but it soon abandons that approach in favour of a reasonably straightforward account of the film-making process in which the two stars of the film within the film, Steven Coogan and Rob Brydon, play themselves or rather are acting 'characters' called Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon since this is fiction and not a documentary. It is never as funny or as 'post-modern' as it thinks it is and somehow it is the 'Tristram Shandy' sequences which come off best. Still, it is as idiosyncratic as anything Michael Winterbottom has done, self-indulgent and bold at the same time. It will do until someone actually films "Tristram Shandy".</fullReview>

The idea of making a movie about the making of a movie sounds interesting and that is what made me rent the movie in the first place. However, then one should at least pick a piece of literature that lends itself to this kind of topic. Instead the producers picked a novel that really didn't lend itself to making a movie, which I guess is the whole point of the movie in the first place. However, it didn't work in this case and if you haven't seen it don't waste your time renting or even worse, buying the DVD.

		<fullReview>I suppose "TRistram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story" was (is?) a real book, but I am not familiar with it. I actually wanted to see the movie because of the "Cock and Bull" reference. One of the explanations of the phrase involves patrons at two Stony Stratford hotels a block from each other, the Cock Hotel and the Bull Hotel, trying to outdo each other with tall tales. About 10 years ago I stayed at the Cock Hotel for a month, and hoped to see it again. No such luck.The critic Ebert gives this movie 4 stars, he obviously enjoyed it. I give it a much lower rating. It reminded me at times of the Monty Python approach to comedy, at other times the Cris Guest approach, in movies like "This is Spinal Tap". The dialog and scenes often seem improvised. Maybe I just was expecting something totally different.Anyway, the main actors play themselves, in the process of making this movie which had always been considered "unmakable." Maybe that's the joke, they didn't even make it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tristram Redux</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tristram Shandy," by Laurence Sterne, is a complex and funny mid-18th century serial novel, partially about the creation of a novel. "Tristram Shandy," by Michael Winterbottom (director) and Martin Hardy (screenplay), is a complex and very funny 2006 movie, wholly about the making of a movie. The devilish thinking giving birth to the film must have gone like this: here's an utterly complicated work of literature, the action skipping back and forth, asides following asides, the reader frequently being addressed, all in an early bloggish, stream-of-consciousness style - a most unlikely candidate for a movie - so let's introduce a whole new set of characters (the actors as themselves), and see who keeps standing at the end. (Apologies for the Sterne-ish writing; it's contagious.)With a fine cast of English stage actors, mostly not well known to American movie audiences, Winterbottom (of the ambitious but not altogether successful "Code 46") has a joyride here, taking the pivotal story element of Tristram's birth, first presenting it as a Masterpiece Theater scene, then pulling the camera back to show the action being shot - and next, we get involved with the comedy-drama going on among the cast and the production people. Steve Coogan (Alan Partridge himself) is both Tristram and his father, making the transition with an explanation to the audience, and for a good part of the movie, he plays "Steve Coogan," the actor for whom Tristan is the role of a lifetime... even while making a mess of his "real life," complete with the mother of his baby son ("we are not married"), Kelly MacDonald, and his would-be amorous production assistant, Naomie Harris. When action returns to the making of movie-within-the-movie, meaning and mirth deepen and widen. Rob Brydon plays Toby Shandy and himself, absolutely hilarious in both roles. Jeremy Northam is the director, surrounded by wonderful actors in minute, but sharply drawn roles, playing characters that are essential to the making of a film, but virtually unknown to the public... except from movies about movies. I find nothing funny or noteworthy about Gillian Anderson, a grossly over-rated actress, but the circumstances under which she is added to the "Tristram" cast had me on the floor. I am looking forward to the DVD because the good stuff goes by so fast, you want to rewind time and again, even while enjoying the fast ride. Here's a portion of the opening sentence of the novel, a style giving Thomas Mann or James Joyce a run for their money. "I wish either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as they were in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they were about when they begot me; had they duly consider'd how much depended upon what they were then doing; -- that not only the production of a rational Being was con- cern'd in it, but that possibly the happy formation and temperature of his body, perhaps his genius and the very cast of his mind ; -- and, for aught they knew to the contrary, even the fortunes of his whole house might take their turn from the humours and dispositions which were then uppermost; -- Had they duly weighed and considered all this, and proceeded accordingly, -- I am verily persuaded I should have made a quite different figure in the world, from that, in which the reader is likely to see me. -- Believe me, good folks, this is not so inconsiderable a thing as many of you may think it; -- you have all, I dare say, heard of the animal spirits, as how they are transfused from father to son, &amp;c. &amp;c..."If your eyes glazed over already, take the easy way out, and see the movie instead.

		<shortDescription>cinematic romp through 'tristram shandy', in which Steve coogan plays himself in a behind-the-scenes loot at a production of the same.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>just saw this at Denver film festival. wonderful surprise as hadn't heard much about it - despite it having a who's who of my favourite British actors. Steve Coogan is outstanding but then so is everyone else.hats off to Michael Winterbottom and (writer) martin hardy for presenting an 18th century post-modern novel in a post-post-modern format in a lively and emotionally engaging way. they prove that the satirical humour and wit of mid-18th century england fits perfectly with contemporary Britain: the anti-self-portrait, self-obsession and paranoia hidden beneath bitten tongues.not to mention the joyous camera and edit: subtle observation most of the time, hectic when needed.an inspiration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seattle International Film Festival preview - David Jeffers for SIFFblog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tuesday November 15, 7:00pm The Harvard Exit, SeattleTristram Shandy begins and ends with two bickering actors. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon start off crabbing over who gets top billing and end in a ridiculous competition of dueling Al Pacinos. Michael Winterbottom's attempt to film Laurence Sterne's unfilmable novel tries hard to be part Fellini and part Rob Reiner, "A book that thick doesn't have an index?" It is terribly funny and tremendously annoying at the same time. Nino Rota's score from Amarcord is amusing for a minute but seems lazy and gauche after forty. Coogan as the adult Shandy narrates the birth of his character, over and over, and over, and over, and over, and over. At one point the filmmakers place him naked in a giant cutaway womb! The combination of idiotic humor, dirty jokes and hysterical laughs make Tristram Shandy a genuine guilty pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go see this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I highly recommend everyone to go and see this movie when it comes to your city, town, whatever! It's a great movie! It was very funny, witty, and contains a lot of British humor. It's a little hard to follow at times, but it's so entertaining. Gillian Anderson has a cameo role as herself and as Widow Wadman, and she is brilliant in her screen time. Steve Coogan is brilliant as well. This was the first time I had ever seen him in anything before, and now I'll be following his career. I had a chance to attend this movie at the New York Film Festival this year and got to watch it with the cast, and attend the Q&amp;A as well. It is so interesting on how they went about making this movie. I'm not sure how to sum it up without giving spoilers, but they say that Tristram Shandy is a book that cannot be filmed. The only thing I can say is that Michael Winterbottom succeeded---he definitely did the book justice!! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite let down!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i sat down in the cinema to watch a cock and bull story i was expecting to laugh for the remainder of the day. But what i saw frustrated and bored me so much it wasn't true. I'm a huge fan of Coogan and Brydon and i would strongly recommend watching any other of their films or series but stay clear of this film. The film is mildly entertaining at the best of times but i think that is because the weak narrative lets any comic timing down. In parts of the film Coogan and Brydon are obviously improvising and the results are very funny. My advice to anyone thinking about watching this film in the cinema's is "don't".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose when you engage an unfunny comedian to play the lead in an unfilmable novel you get what you deserve. Clearly there ARE those who derive some sort of pleasure out of watching Steve Coogan being arrogant - as good a definition of 'typecasting' as you'll ever see - and possibly ATTEMPTING to be funny and if there are ENOUGH of them then this travesty may find an audience. After all there are those who find Lee Evans funny and as you don't see them out in the daytime they may well fill the cinemas after dark and help this to get its neg cost back which is more than it deserves. All too often lately and more especially since the inception of 'lottery' funding the question 'how did THAT ever get made' raises its incredulous head. Don't ask me, pal, I don't DO the lottery. I USED to but then they started using my money for crap like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard of the novel that this was based on.The director Micheal Winterbottom has done a few decent films.This is not one of them.There were a few humorous moments BUT enough of themI am not a Television watcher, so I am unfamiliar with Steve Coogan.Let me be kind &amp; say I will not go out of my way to watch any other film he was in.I also was confused many times in watching this, as I was not sure what was happening.This had a short run on a few screens in 2006. To those who missed it, you did not miss anything.Ratings: ** (out of 4) 64 points (out of 100) IMDb 5 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>oceans 12 all over again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>if you loved oceans 12, you're probably going to love this one. it has the same constant muttering of movie stars, haphazard scenes flung together, god-awful smugness, and random cozey-talks that goes nowhere. which is why i don't like this movie. it actually has a few bright moments, e.g when actual parts of the book is strung up. but they're watered out with too much middle-movie nonsense. as for the "novelty" of being a film about making an impossible book into a movie... thats already been done so much better.its called "adaption". go see that one if you like the idea of this movie, but didn't like oceans 13.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely horrible, horrible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I played the lottery, I'd be pretty miffed that this film was 'made with lottery money', as surely the point of the lottery is that some of the money goes to good causes? This is a shockingly bad film. Steve Coogan used to be funny. Given a decent script and a good cast to work with, he can do amazing work ('The Day Today', 'Knowing Me, Knowing You' spring to mind) but what is it with Coogan and his movies that whatever he touches turns to mud? This movie is an absolute mess from start to finish - and I'm talking as someone who, as a fan of Coogan, was looking forward to seeing this film. The direction (such that it is) is jumbled, the acting is so-so.... but what was the point of making such a pile of unintelligible rubbish? There have been good reviews and the interviews that Coogan &amp; Brydon have given were enough to make me go and see it. We are thrown a curve ball of the worst kind with this travesty of a movie. My weekend was saved by seeing The Butterfly Effect for the first time but honestly... avoid this film at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can save each and every one of you ?6..by recommending you DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!! I have just sat through the entire film (i'm told it only last 94 mins, i'd have sworn it was 3 days!!) and i wanted to kill myself afterwards. It is not funny, it is not entertaining and it certainly is NOT worth the price of the tickets. Steve Coogan is painfully up his own 'backside'. everything about this film reeks of Steve 'i'm only doing this so i get a listing in film, it has to be better than my last few efforts and with this cast, how can i go wrong' Coogan. Well, i'm sorry, but you can go wrong, and OMG you did!! It has a plot with no point, no character that you can get attached too..it's utterly humiliatingly embarrassing for all who's name appears in the final credit..and that is a lot of big name stars. I apparently missed one of the best bits (i gave up and went to the loo to escape) and can still say i'm not sorry to have missed it - it featured one of three scenes with Gillian Anderson, who was the only reason i went in the first place.I really, honestly can not stress this enough...DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. What i do suggest is everyone holds off until the DVD release. Then, all put in say 50p each and buy a copy of the DVD. We then all take a turn of watching it all (i'll only do this to see the bit i missed while at the loo, featuring Gillian) and then we post it on to the next person. Anyone.....?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tristram Shandy is, supposedly, unadaptable. On the strength of this effort, there will be no need to revise that verdict.In an attempt to capture the prototype postmodernism of the novel, Michael Winterbottom has interwoven the rambling story of Shandy's birth (which draws in the fate of various members of his family and surrounding ensemble) with the supposed 'real-life' story of the cast and crew making the film. So, we have Steve Coogan in a pair of breeches addressing the camera in full-on Laurence Sterne mode, and then Steve Coogan in a conspicuously fashionable t-shirt and jeans, making a fuss about his character's shoes and having a casual affair with one of the production girls. On the way there are plenty of in-jokes about Coogan's other projects: Alan Partridge, Around the World in 80 Days, visits to lap-dancing clubs, etc.The thing about all this is that it would be absolutely riveting viewing if Steve Coogan was the most important person in your entire universe. To me, however, he is a moderately famous comic with too many cars who is best known for not impregnating Courtney Love. Therefore, sitting through the long and indulgent sections of A Cock &amp; Bull Story that were about him was a bit of a trial. If you haven't heard of Steve Coogan at all, so much the worse - none of this is going to make any sense to you whatsoever. It's a messy, irritating movie, which forces its impressive cast to the margins as they all have to flutter around the gigantic ego of a bitter and dislikeable central performance.</fullReview>
