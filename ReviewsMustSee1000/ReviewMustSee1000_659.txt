		<shortDescription>Landmark near masterpiece of the cultural clash between nature and civilisation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Nicolas Roeg's (`Don't Look Now') cinematographic skills and admiration pay especial tribute to Walkabout's powerful combination of Australia's awesome scenic diversity and the sensual Jenny Agutter, and the whole effect is embellished by John Barry's sublimely magical score. I would hasten to add that as well as being very pleasing to watch, enhanced by Roeg's voyeuristic use of the camera, Agutter provides a skilful performance as a prejudiced unworldly teenager, who is naively unaware of the sexuality she exudes whether naked or wearing her high cut school skirt. Although it was a somewhat amusing shock to recently discover that a body double was employed for Agutter in the shower scenes for `An American Werewolf in London', no such deceit was used in this film. Immediately after filming `Walkabout', Agutter reprised her BBC serialisation role of two years earlier as Bobbie for Lionel Jeffries' sumptuous version of Edith Nesbit's `The Railway Children', ensuring her immortalization as an iconographic beauty. She graduated thirty years on into the role of the mother for a Carlton TV production and is currently involved in producing a film script about the life of the author.On a deadly picnic into the desert a father (John Meillon; `Crocodile Dundee') inexplicably snaps, shooting at his two children before torching his car and turning the gun on himself. Now the children, absurdly kitted out in their formal school uniforms, are lost and carelessly lose their provisions, except for the transistor radio with its inane babble being another illustration of how hopeless our technology is against nature. Fortuitously they stumble upon an oasis and find their only saviour in the form of an Aborigine (David Gulpilil; `Rabbit Proof Fence') on a rites-of-passage walkabout. The seven year old boy (Lucien John, the director's son) happily has a child's ability to communicate with the Aborigine despite the language barrier, something his older sister never grasps, deftly demonstrated on their first encounter when she is increasingly frustrated by the lack of comprehension of her demands for water. Roeg crosscuts stunning kaleidoscopic images of the physical landscape and its critters, with the killing of animals and the domestic butchering of joints of meat to give a stark contrast between nature and civilisation. However, given this was his first solo effort, his overworked montages can be a little irritating and confusing, and show off the cinematographer rather than the director in Roeg.The director emphasises the unrealised sexual tension by explicitly marrying shots of both the teenagers with suggestive trees in the form of intertwined human limbs, as well as providing us with a diverting interlude involving a group of meteorologists. The deeply sad misunderstanding of the two cultures gives poignancy to the film that is its strength, especially delineated by the Aborigine's tribal courtship dance for Agutter, which only serves to terrify her and increase her distrust. Her lack of emotion for their former helpmate is staggering. When faced with a dangling corpse the girl asks trivial questions of her brother about his breakfast whilst pointlessly picking ants off the body. The tragic outcome is also indicative of the current state of Aboriginal life expectancy with a higher proportion dying through accident, assault and self-harm than any other Australian demographic group.The failure of her parents to prepare her for the change from childhood may have contributed to the tragedy, and it is only on reflection years later, living the same life as her parents and similarly caged in an apartment block, that Agutter's character senses that maybe she missed her chance. It is interesting to note that the children are deliberately English to highlight the cultural clash between the European settlers and the original inhabitants of this ancient land, and I wonder if similarly white Australians would have had any more understanding of the indigenous customs of the Aborigine boy. `Walkabout' is a far more visual depiction of sexual awakening colliding with alien cultures than that other famous picnic that goes horribly wrong in Peter Weir's `Picnic at Hanging Rock' (which this predates by four years), with its metaphorically implied unease centred on a sacred Aboriginal site that eventually destroys the established order of a Ladies College.`Walkabout' is as relevant today as when it was released in the era of ?70's industrialisation with the Kakadu National Park once again under threat from a new uranium mine on its boundary. The Northern Territory's tribe Mirrar is currently involved in this dispute over land rights and excavations, although mining was temporarily ceased on Aboriginal land in the mid 1990's. This is a sensitive issue as Australia's economy relies on the export of uranium in the production of nuclear power, and Aborigines oppose the exploitation of the Earth's resources for profit. The company at the centre of this discord also operates the Ranger mine which is depicted along with the rock band Midnight Oil (well known for their campaigning land rights missive `Beds Are Burning') in eX de Medici's `Nothing's As Precious As A Hole In The Ground', a recent acquisition by Australia's National Portrait Gallery.Despite last year's rush by some of Hollywood's well-known directors returning home to make Aboriginal films, including Phillip Noyce's `Rabbit Proof Fence' (released 21 February) about the ?Stolen Generation', and `Yolngu Boy' which did well at a film festival in Colorado, I sadly suspect very few of us in the UK are likely to see them. Apparently there has not been a commercial success for a black-themed movie since 1955's `Jedda', the first Australian feature to star Aboriginal actors. If the hope of a ?70's New Wave style revival is to be realised for Australian cinema, surely it is time for the industry worldwide to wake up to the fact that a wealth of film exists outside of Hollywood, and that the viewing public may actually welcome some variety.With the release of the director's full cut in 1998 both the DVD and the video are unusually available for the UK as well as the US from Amazon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>INNOCENCE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Goodness gracious it's amazing how many reviewers missed the most obvious aspect of the film. This tale is about innocence and it approaches that from many different angles. As for Roeg practicing camera tricks-maybe today these are tricks but at the time the style was a pioneering method of telling and showing psychological elements, wasted on todays audiences. Roeg presents innocence in juxtaposition with the hardness and neuroses of society, not as WHITEMAN BAD but as society, modern society makes us very neurotic by taking away our innocence. Roeg makes an brilliant point and stylizes a mostly nonverbal experience by letting us journey with children all on the cusp of some new stage of growth. This movie is a small masterpiece!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very beautiful and mysterious film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In Australia, when an Aborigine man-child reaches sixteen, he is sent out into the land. For months he must live from it. Sleep on it. Eat of its fruit and flesh. Stay alive. Even if it means killing his fellow creatures. The Aborigines call it the WALKABOUT. This is the story of a 'WALKABOUT'." Thus begins Nicolas Roeg's 1971 debut feature, "Walkabout", one of the most beautiful, mystical, and magical film I've had the privilege of seeing as a filmgoer. Seeing it again recently on the beautiful Criterion edition DVD, I was once more captivated by this film as it slowly worked its magic on me. The "plot" of "Walkabout" is simplicity itself: a teenage girl (Jenny Agutter) and her little brother (the director's son in real life, Lucien John Roeg--billed "Lucien John" on the credits) are stranded on an Australian outback as their father, who took them out for a picnic, suddenly and inexplicably commits suicide. The two of them are thus left wandering by themselves and it looks as if they will die in the vast wilderness--until they encounter an Aborigine boy who is on his "walkabout," an Aborigine rite of passage into manhood. For a time these kids travel together as a trio and the Aborigine's skills in hunting and finding water allow them to survive. And although the girl and her brother will eventually find their way back to civilization, for a brief unspecified length of time the exotic Australian outback becomes a wondrous and mystical place where their story of survival unfolds. If you've seen this film, you know that the brief synopsis above doesn't really touch what is so special about "Walkabout." And that is because "Walkabout" isn't really about plot, like more conventional films. It is one of those rare films like Peter Weir's "Picnic at Hanging Rock," Terrence Malick's "Days of Heaven," and Wim Wender's "Wings of Desire" which are all about evoking a kind of sad and bittersweet emotional response from us. I think that is what "Walkabout" is mostly about. The overall impact of this film "hits you in the heart" and very impressionable viewers might be stirred in their emotions to the point of swooning in the scene at the end where the girl, now a married woman, remembers her idyllic days happily swimming in one of the outback's water holes Nicolas Roeg was not only the director of "Walkabout" but also its cinematographer. And his photography in this film is unbearably beautiful and sumptuous. "Walkabout" is without a doubt one of the most gorgeous color films ever made. Shot on location in the Australian outback--perhaps one of the most exotic places on earth--"Walkabout" has a visual grandeur that is reminiscent of passages from David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia" and John Ford's "The Searchers." Never has the "voodoo of location shooting" (as Werner Herzog likes to call it) been more manifest than in this film. In fact, the exotic and unique location in which it was shot, coupled with Roeg's masterful cinematography, feels like one of the main characters in "Walkabout." The film's location adds a mystical (almost spiritual) and meditative dimension to it which lingers in the viewer's mind--haunting it long after the film is over. If Roeg's photography is one of the film's main characters, so is John Barry's legendary and justly famous score. Maybe it's the harp used in the score, or the subtle billowing quality of its composition (i.e. the way its beautiful melody gently builds and builds), but the music in this film simply soars. It moves me like no other score I've ever heard. It feels completely transcendent, as if it exists outside time and space altogether--but gently swooping down from time to time, "kissing" this film's images with aching sweetness. All of the above elements work together to form a film-viewing experience that inspires both beauty and awe in us. The film's message is not necessarily that life in the outback is better than life in a modern civilization, but that no matter where you happen to find yourself (even if that happens to be a wilderness like the Australian outback), if you have resources that meet your basic needs, it can become your "home" for a time. And that afterwards there is bitter-sweetness in reminiscing about those "good times" you were fortunate enough to have--to which you can never return again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Australian outback comes alive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superb cinematography, the Australian outback comes alive in this film of self discovery and regret. Agutter plays the English girl brilliantly, incapable of comprehending anybody or anything that doesn't conform to her middle-class values and upbringing. Roeg is also excellent as her brother, adapting to each and every change in circumstance as only children can. I have watched this movie many times, and always get something new from it. Highly recommended to anyone, although parents might want to watch it before letting their kids see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this is a sound film, and the characters talk to one another, this film could have been made just as well in the 1920s. It does not really need sound.The film is about nature, and man's relationship with it. If a civilised person were left out in the desert, then they would soon die. But, as this film shows, there are people and creatures living out there quite happily.The film has been criticised for having a weak beginning and a weak end. But where does the story of this film start? And where and when would you end it? Yes you can end it when the two children get back to civilisation. But does the story end there? No. Because of their experiences, things are never going to be the same again. And for them, the story has not finished, it is only just beginning.I have seen this film several times and I notice something different every time I see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as comments about Roeg's going overboard with his message of "nature/aborigine good, industrialisation/white men bad," this is a simplistic way of reading it. First of all, every director has his or her own style, and Roeg started as a cinematographer--his movies tend to contain long, meditative (or, boring, depending on one's view) visual passages. Roeg floods the screen with cascades of images, by turns repetitive and contrasting, much as a poet uses the sounds and rhythms of words, as well as their semantic content, to create "meaning" in the context of the poem.To expect Roeg not to dwell on images is to expect Tolstoy not to go off on 20-page rants about how the lack of Napoleon would necessitate another to fill his historical role. One overlooks idiosyncracies in one's friends.I found the movie much more powerful than I expected. My only disappointment with the Criterion DVD release is with the commentaries. I would love to have heard more about the story, and it would have been nice to have heard from David Gulpilil, whose role as the aborigine was a watershed in Australian cinema, as noted in the IMDb article on his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding commentary on cultural clashes, though a bit puzzling at times.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sometimes puzzling, sometimes enigmatic, but always interesting movie, although it is a bit easier to understand if you've read the novel on which it's based. Jenny Agutter is particularly good as the English girl who suddenly finds herself stranded in the desert with her younger brother, and was at just the right age--about 16--to play the part. David Gulpilil as the aborigine youth "gone walkabout" who rescues them is also excellent. The uncomfortable contrasts between European and aboriginal cultures are undeniably accurate, and the use of A. E. Housman's poem, "Into my heart an air that kills" adds additional poignancy to the already bittersweet ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful lead character and a film with a subtle message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first remember seeing this film as a late teenager in about 1979. Therefore what most vividly stuck in my mind was the lead character played by a beautiful blonde English girl, Jenny Agutter, Specifically the nude scenes of her swimming and washing.On a less superficial level it is a film with a point-something along the lines of the graciousness of Aborigines and their ability to live in harsh surrounds, and the destructive nature of suburban life in a flat in a major city.I think it would be a film, like Jedda, that will always be on reference for the Australian Outback, Aboriginals and the modern society which brought a European civilisation to their land.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's this talk about "Walkabout"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late sixties and early seventies there was an unusual kind of excitement when you went to the movies. It probably had not happened since movies were first invented and has not happened since in commercial theatrical releases. This was the feeling of "I don't know what is going to happen next"! What happened one day was completely unexpected when I first saw the opening of "Walkabout". The introduction gave almost no clue as to what was to come next, but it was visually and aurally fascinating. The rapidity in which the plot shifted gears made you more sympathetic to the plight of our main characters. The sudden appearance of the Aborigine boy in the nick of time and his taking them under his wing. Then surprises of all surprises--our heroine does many nude scenes. Then her final look of yearning at the end suddenly explains it all. All the while Roeg is doing a travelogue of the Australian outback. This movie is pure genius from beginning to end. A must for any movie collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh the 70s...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before specifically talking about the film, I just have to ponder the following question: Why do all films that take place in the 70s feel so 70s? Considering the fact that this movie was made in 1971, one must conclude that Roeg was a trend-setter. For my personal tastes, he went a little overboard with the freeze frames, jump cutting, radical though hardly subtle politics, and juxtaposition of jarring images. Aboriginal tearing into meat, Australian white butcher cutting meat in a sanitized setting, back to the Aboriginal, back to the butcher, and back again to the Aboriginal. And what's with all the scenes involving decomposing bodies? Yes, savage innocence, evil imperialists, death, nature vs. industrialization, corruption of a purer way of life, we see all these themes, but it would have been preferable to see it without being visually and aurally clubbed over the head like the poor animals in the outback are.Disregarding that aspect, I quite liked the story of two white children, one very young, the other pubescent (and lingeringly shot), who get stuck in the Outback after their patriarchal and borderline psycho father is blown up. They then struggle to make it in the wild, and come upon an Aboriginal boy who is on a "walkabout", or a rite of passage journey that boys that age traditionally undertake in order to prove their worthiness as a man. This of course, becomes their walkabout, and they too become "wild" and free. Eventually, they make it back to "civilization", the first sign of this being a beautiful shot of the girl (whose name we never know- thus making it even more symbolic), coming into a clearing and gliding her hand over a man-made fence while walking backwards. What could be more symbolic of the Western values of property and ownership than a fence? She is ecstatic to be near an environment she holds dear, but her younger and more adaptable brother is less so, and the Aboriginal boy is even less so, which leads to tragic consequences.The movie feels dated, not only in terms of camera-work but also thematically. It's no longer the job of white people to romanticize "savage" peoples, but rather to allow peoples to define themselves. Perhaps Roeg, in some small way, recognized this, thus choosing to have the Aboriginal boy speak his language and not provide us with subtitles. We could never understand totally, though we can sympathize.cococravescinema.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roeg's first masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nicholas Roeg's trademarks are very clear: beautiful cinematography, extensive inter-cutting, a willingness to be mildly experimental and a basic thematic preoccupation with the sudden collision of different cultures or lifestyles. Whether these characteristics are sufficient to sustain a director's career, or to form the basis for distinguished achievement within commercial cinema, remains problematic." - Chuck Kleinhans (1974)Apparently Roeg's preoccupations weren't enough to sustain his career. In the 1970s he made a string of great films, but by the late 1980s Roeg had all but disappeared from cinema."Walkabout" (1971), regarded by many as Roeg's finest film, offers a deceptively simple story. Here a father drives his young daughter and son out into the Australian desert. He harbours sexual feelings for his daughter and so, in an attempt to end his lusts, plots to kill both his children. His murderous plan fails, however, and the kids escape. The father then puts a gun in his mouth and commits suicide.The two children thus find themselves stranded in the middle of the Australian Outback. They make their way across the desert, but are unprepared for this harsh environment.Luckily, an adolescent aboriginal boy on his "walkabout" (a tribal rites of passage) finds the two kids. He helps them forage for food and water, and gladly escorts them back to civilisation. But like the father, the aboriginal boy soon becomes sexually attracted to the young girl. He's seduced by her beauty, her short school skirt and pale skin. He performs a mating dance, but due to a lack of understanding, the girl rejects the boy's ritualistic advances. The boy commits suicide.Slowly Reog's themes coalesce: "Walkabout's" entire male cast seems seduced by the film's female protagonist (Jenny Agutter), the girl an innocent siren who lures men to their deaths.The first male to fall under the girl's spell, of course, is her father. This unhealthy romantic interest is the only reason presented for his insanity. Later, the girl's brother will spy on her swimming unclothed in a lagoon. Not even his young years can spare him from her enchantment. Then there's the aboriginal saviour, who toward the end of film performs a vibrant mating dance. It is in this relationship where the film's sexual contrasts are made most clear. Roeg's males are beholden to the unreachable girls whims, needs, and beauty. As such, there is sense of unattainability apparent in each relationship: father cannot be with daughter, brother with sister or "savage" with lady. It is even accentuated through the girl's attire: her school uniform is prohibitive of romantic interest.The film is bookended by two strange deaths, which are both suicides and seemingly caused by the girl. However, she does not seem bothered by these deaths and simply accepts them as being part of her nature. This adds a tragic dimension to everything that happens in the film, making the girl's eventual salvation depressing rather than hopeful.Roeg's second big theme is that of communication. The urban kids rely on verbal language and find security in the constant warble of a portable radio. In contrast, communication with the native is effective only through crude physical gestures. Thus, the cultured and the pre-industrial can't communicate. It's this lack of communication, an inability to converse on the same wavelength with the female, that dooms the man. He withers in the desert, while she walks free, blissfully unaware of the power she holds over him.The film is also obsessed with creating fleeting juxtapositions. A burning car is crosscut with a roasting animal carcass. The urban children are first seen together in a swimming pool next to an ocean, whilst later they'll be surrounded by the arid desert. Western clothing is contrasted with the native's nakedness. The native hunts with spears, whilst a team of European scientists (also on a sort of Western walkabout) are shown hunting game with rifles and jeeps. Similarly, shots of the native cutting apart a kangaroo for dinner are contrasted to an urban butchers shop.These juxtapositions are simple (wet/dry, naked/clothed, technology/primitive) and Roeg never develops them into anything beyond a superficial language, but they do help to elevate the film above the typical siren fable (mermaids, lady in the lake etc).In a typical "sirens allegory", it is simply female beauty which poses a deadly threat to man. In "Walkabout", this threat is expanded. The film's not simply about the rapturous beauty of women, but rather the desires of man to conquer, master and possess. Looked at this way, the film can be broken down into clear compartments: man seeks to conquer woman, but fails. Thus, man goes on a "walkabout", a masculine rites of passage to prove his manhood (native boy, scientists etc). Through this rites of passage, man learns to conquer environment, and through this, superiority is gained over woman. Woman submits, man is happy. Only woman does not submit; preternatural and ghostly, she mocks his pretence.9/10 - Makes a good companion piece to Welles' "F For Fake", Malick's "Days of Heaven" and Altman's "3 Women".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what is life changing about this film is you get to experience the life of an aborigine in his natural environment. with no help from anything except the land itself and thousands of years of culture behind him, he hunts lizards and kangaroos with handmade spears straightened by his teeth. he drinks water right out of the dirt with a straw stuck in the mud. its amazing. and it changes you. you see as if for the first time, the power and the credibility of what the native aborigine represents. he doesn't need clothes, or money. he just needs to be a part of his world, which he is at total peace with. what could be more sane than that.juxtaposed against a father taking his children out for a picnic in the bush who cracks up and commits suicide, leaving his children stranded. in their innocence they actually do pretty well for themselves, coming upon an oasis, but it dries up the next day. thats when the aborigine arrives.the children see him as a life saver and even though they don't speak the same language, the little boy in his desperation points to his mouth and says glug glug glug and the aborigine laughs hysterically and goes back to the dried up oasis and starts sucking water out of the ground with a straw, then gives them a drink.so begins the journey where the children learn the ways of the aborigine. but they are not aborigine. they are very Australian, at least the girl is. eventually the aborigine brings them closer and closer to civilization, which seems absolutely barbaric by comparison. the aborigine does not kill for sport, and he uses everything and takes nothing more than he needs. the Australians, kill for the enjoyment of killing. finally the aborigine sees a road and touches it with his foot, he sees a steer and tries to kill it but is almost run over by some white hunters, who kill just to leave the animals rot.this vision of depravity so terribly affects the aborigine, so devastates him that he goes almost mad. he returns back to the hut that he brought the girl to, possibly out of his love for her, and he dances a dance of desire for her. the girl gets scared and starts to hide from him in the shack. you get the real sense of houses containing shadows that cut people off from the direct experience of one another that they had when they were out in the wilderness under the stars.he dances and dances, but she ignores him, rebuffs his gentle advances. she falls asleep and the next day the boy finds that the aborigine is not moving. he is up in a tree, apparently dead.the girl and boy make their way back to civilization, which is horrifying. the movie abruptly ends with the girl older now thinking back to the time she had in the wilderness.i am not giving this movie justice. just suffice to say it breaks your heart. you feel the loss of the aborigine. the impact is tremendous because this is real. he lost so much. yet the world doesn't seem to care. why in gods name cant we care about what we have done to the people who have given us the gift of showing us how to live in harmony with nature. happy. without doubt. full of joy. we cannot improve on this. man living in harmony with nature is perfection. what can we say about our own civilization, filled with suffering and people preying upon each other. our world is hell compared with what the aborigine has in his hands, or had. we made sure that our misery became his misery. as the earth is used up this movie is more and more relevant. but we have become so crippled we cant even cry for what has gone, never to return. what a loss! Why don't we see it? the innocence is gone. we killed it. we killed it. we killed it.</fullReview>

The subject matter of the movie forces us to confront differences between the modern world and the primitive world; yet it underscores similarities between the two cultures. There are also some very nice techniques used in this film - for example the screen wipes used as the small boy relates a story to the older boy. A thought provoking film shot from, and that looks at the world from, a perspective that is rarely seen in cinema.

		<fullReview>---Some Spoilers Ahead---This film is simply fantastic. Nicolas Roeg's direction is stellar. At some point in the film, he realizes that the characters and story line take a life of their own and opts for an approach to the film's cinematography(Keep in mind before directing, Roeg was a cinematographer)that is stunning. This film is interesting on other levels as well. While the story may seem simplistic, there are many layers to the film's message. One is a linguistical approach. The film examines language barriers, yet it portrays a boy that hasn't been indoctrinated into social norms. He transcends this, and has no problems adapting to the aborigine's culture. There is a racial layer attached to this film as well. We see that the aborigine boy, who is tall, handsome, and black, will never be accepted by the socially indoctrinated English girl. His unwanted romantic overtures are what leads him to commit suicide. The film makes a brilliant commentary on 'civilized' societies corrupt and dacaying ways in the scene where the boy and girl come out of the wilderness and their first glimpse of civilization are ruins of twisted, industrial machines left to rot in the boundaries of where the outback and civilization meet. There are so many great things in this film, I would need to write a book just to cover them all. This is a must see for any person that enjoys thought provoking, intense, adventurous film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It made a refreshing change to find this film on TV this weekend. I knew nothing about it but from the beginning I could tell it would be interesting and good. First, it had that early 70s feel about it: edgy, a bit experimental, with long brooding shots of people and places. Second, the opening shocking scenes drew me in to wondering what would happen to the two children. Third, Jenny Agutter looks absolutely fantastic: who cares about the slow pace when you've got such a beautiful face (sic) to look at? As the film progressed, I particularly admired the young boy's performance - remarkable considering the conditions he had to perform in. There are also many great shots of Australian scenery and wildlife. I was a bit irritated by the obvious attempts by the director to "raise the heat" but I concede that much of it was justified. The film does appear to drag (even more!) towards the end, but I was fascinated by the abandoned places.At the end I saw that it was a Nic Roeg film and that explained quite a lot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those films that initially seems quite simple but is actually very complex and asks many questions,Walkabout is a stunning piece of cinema. The actual plot is pretty straight forward and can be described in a sentence,but it deals with important issues and leaves the viewer to ponder on things. It also features some of the best photography {by it's director} ever,so that even if you're not interested in thinking and questioning what you have just seen,you can just sit back and let the images wash over you.Indeed,many of the best sequences in the film emphasise image and music above dialogue,such as the {slightly controversial} scene where Jenny Agutter takes a nude swim in a lake,intercut with shots of the protagonists journey,while John Barry's simply heavenly theme plays {his score is one of his most evocative}.It's beautiful and soothing,and not gratuitous,Agutter's nudity is there to make a point,to empathise her character's sense of freedom,brief though it might be. The scene also contrasts the behaviour of the Aboriginal in the film {who despite being not 'civilised' goes nowhere near Agutter during her swim} with a group of male scientists in the desert {who ogle and leer at the one female around}Other imagery in the film is more jarring,with the director Nicolas Roeg perhaps overdoing the amount of shots of slaughtered animals,and equally the use of sound is occasionally forced,such as the oft heard sound of a radio being tuned. One is sometimes unsure of what Roeg is trying to say.However,the major themes of the film are unavoidable and pertinent. It contrasts 'civilisation' with 'savagery',and asks us to decide which is best. No Noble Savage clichés here,the harshness of the Aboriginals life {look at all the flies that buzz around him}is not avoided. There is the way that 'civilisation' encroaches on nature and often ends up just exploiting it. Perhaps however the film is more about communication between cultures,or lack of,and it ends up being very moving,a possible romance that doesn't happen because of simple lack of understanding,in fact Agutter doesn't really bother to communicate properly with the Aboriginal at all {but note how her young brother and the Aboriginal do understand each other}. The final scene is extremely sad and poignant,but watch it again and decide if it isn't just idealised memory rather than real memory. Even right at the end,Roeg gets us to think about what we are being shown.The acting by the three leads is astonishing,especially by Lucien John {Roeg's son} as the young boy. Perhaps a few of Roeg's stylistic quirks may annoy,and it's certainly not a film for those after action.However,Walkabout is an fascinating and rewarding experience that will probably linger long in the memory long after many other films have faded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Coming-of-Age Drama Set in the Australian Outback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WALKABOUT is quite simply a stunning cinematic experience. Directed and photographed by Nicolas Roeg, it tells of an English schoolgirl (Jenny Agutter) and her brother (Lucien John) getting lost in the Australian outback, and encountering an Aborigine (David Gulpilil), who looks after them and ensures their survival. In an opening title-card Roeg tells us that a "walkabout" is an aboriginal ritual whereby young men leave their families and set out on their own to discover themselves as well as prove their masculinity. In this film all three adolescents are in a sense on "walkabout": while the Aborigine learns to hunt for himself as well as provide nourishment for the other two, the schoolgirl learns to divest herself of her Englishness, as well as her inhibitions, as she swims naked in a rock-pool. Her brother sets aside his worldly toys and learns how to gather leaves, as well as pick up some phrases in Aborigine language so as to be able to communicate successfully.Roeg sets this coming-of-age story within the larger theme of the destruction of the natural landscape by humankind. The film opens on the streets of Sydney, choked with cars and box-like apartments; this contrasts starkly with the wide open expanses of the outback where the sun shines pitilessly all day, and both human beings and animals have to learn how to eke out an existence as best they can. This they achieve partly by cunning and partly by making use of natural resources; by civilized standards, they might seem primitive (for example, the Aborigine's wooden spear) but they are stunningly effective. Brought up in the genteel tradition of public (in American, private) schools, the girl and her brother find the Aborigine's behavior rather distasteful at times, but gradually they learn how to adopt his mores.Yet the Aboriginal way of life, just like the life of the animals that people the outback, is under threat. This is emphasized through a series of violent juxtapositions and stop-frames, as white hunters come in their Land-Rovers armed with shotguns and kill anything that moves indiscriminately. They gut and skin the corpses, leaving the skeletons to rot in the burning sun, infested with maggots. Roeg makes a powerful point by juxtaposing such sequences with more mundane images of a butcher in a city shop cutting meat for customers, as if to remind us of where our weekly meat actually comes from. The film ends with a similar image as the schoolgirl, now unhappily married to a respectable white Australian, is shown cutting meat on a chopping-board while her husband prattles on about his latest promotion at work.The film contains some stunning visual images: the sight of the Aborigine shadowed against the setting sun reminds us of his intimate connection to the land. An aerial pan of the rock-pools, showing the schoolgirl swimming naked (not without a certain amount of scopophilic desire on the director's part) shows how she has happily cast off the trappings of civilization and returned to nature. A long shot of the girl and her brother trying to climb a mountain reminds us of human insignificance in this vast and deserted landscape. And finally, at the end of the film, the three youngsters are shown happily bathing once again the rock pool, all of them naked, all enjoying themselves without a shred of racial or sexual prejudice. This image offers us a glimpse of what could be, if only we were to set aside our perception of (culturally constructed) differences.Even after forty years, WALKABOUT communicates a powerful message to audiences about the importance of communal living as the source of social and moral harmony. A true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stark, uncompromising arid beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An urban, slightly sleazy father takes his two public school children into the outback for a picnic. He's in a suit, and has brought some paperwork. His kids are in their stiff school uniforms. Clothes, demeanor, action and the Volkswagon Beetle all jar with the hostile desert location. Something is wrong. We find out what when Dad starts shooting at his son, before blowing his brains out. Sister and brother barely survive a trek through the desert, before crossing paths with a teenage Aborigine on walkabout. It is a rescue of sorts, but danger still stalks the three youngsters.Walkabout is a disturbing film, a difficult piece to get to grips with. It isn't Swallows and Amazons, but nor is it Lord of the Flies. Like the interpersonal relationships between the characters, the film itself is frustratingly unknowable. Images of Australian wildlife snarling, spitting, preying on each other, or just staring disinterestedly, provide the undercurrent of tension between the human sojourners. Jenny Agutter takes a utilitarian approach to her rescuer, the supremely impressive David Gulpilil. She cares for her brother (though little else) in that stilted, clipped, emotionally stunted manner that British public schools cultivate. Her brother seems bizarrely unaware of events, notwithstanding his lack of years, but adapts better than his sister, forging a bond and rudimentary communication with the Aboriginal boy. The rescuer remains inscrutable, benevolent but uncomprehending as he tries to take Agutter for his own in an ill-fated courtship ritual that does not cross the cultural boundary. The woman is as functional to him as the kangaroos and lizards he hunts, though less easy to snarl.Roeg's vision may be a bleak one. Ultimately, he seems to say, we can never know each other. To have human contact is to be hurt, perhaps brutally so. The film ends with Agutter many years later in urban suburbia, apparently as estranged from her be-suited, mustachioed husband as she was from the Aboriginal.And yet there are glimpses of hope. The playful climbing of the tree, the clowning around between the two boys, could be mere lulls in the tedium and brutality, or a sign that we can make a go of things. Most optimistic of all is the upbeat ending, the three children bathing naked in a water-hole, carefree and lacking any of the sexual tension that made the teenagers' relationship so charged. An idyllic illusion, perhaps?Walkabout is challenging, provocative, and despite those clunky 1970s transitions, stands out as an all-time classic. It defies categorisation. Experimental and uncompromising, it is a film that demands re-thinking with every repeat viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Australian outback as art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Technically speaking this film is great: Beautiful cinematography, excellent acting from the three main characters, and compelling editing. That is the easy part to talk about. Much more difficult for me, after literally just finishing the movie less than 5 minutes ago, is to quickly process and review the story. It is a quiet film (another way of saying moves at a deliberate pace) when they are in the wilderness, and moves at a much more frenetic page when they are around civilization. Any scene of killing an animal for food in the wilderness is interposed with a butcher slaughtering his food, most likely grown on a farm and not caught naturally. The whole movie is like this, comparing what was to what has become. There is a lot I do not understand after one viewing, but just like a modern painting or sculpture I feel that the point is not to understand everything, rather to be moved to some type of emotional response. In that it succeeds without a doubt. Rating 26/40</fullReview>

		<fullReview>See WALKABOUT and let yourself drift into what I consider genuine film art. This film is so painfully beautiful I thought I was going to faint whilst watching. It is also genuinely erotic and frightening....and quietly unnerving. Jenny Agutter is rightfully acclaimed for her mesmerizing performance (and we are rewarded with an exquisite nude scene at the end). Gulpilil aged about 16 in the film is both mysterious and bewitching and gives a major performance of simplistic wonder. This is both heartbreaking and extraordinary......and a real Australian experience, which may explain why international comments might be perplexed. A great film companion piece of the other end of the outback spectrum is the brutal male drama WAKE IN FRIGHT also known as OUTBACK. Seek both and then add THE TRACKER and RABBIT PROOF FENCE to get a real grip on Australian existence. Gulpilil is in 3 of these masterpieces and he is rightly lauded in each of them. Today he still lives under a tree in the outback having just completed the breathtaking TEN CANOES.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... to my youth.I saw this film when it first came out, and my hormones were just starting to spiral. Much of what was being presented I did not understand because of my youth, and it made deep deep sense. No, not an oxymoron. A more cliché'd response would be it resonated with me.Clichés and me aside... this is a beautiful tone poem. I just saw it again after years and it was so deeply impressionable then, the sense of awe and fulfillment came rushing back each scene. My partner asked me why did the father start shooting at the children? Why did he commit suicide (sorry, spoiler)? Why this? Why that? I kept saying to sit back and let it waft in like a breeze. It is a tone poem. Which is my review. It is a tone poem. The segue into finding the ramshackle house in nowhere's-ville says it all. The Ab carrying the radio. The Ab with the preppie jacket wrapped around his waist. The girl barefoot. The young boy barefoot and sunburned. I mean, the metaphors were simultaneously slamming one upside the head like a cast iron skillet, and gentle breezes at the same time. I could go on and on. This is simply one of the great films, ever. It strips away yet simultaneously must utilize modern conventions to convey the story. The sexual references at the same time sledge hammered into the lens yet human beings are wired to respond to these slices of life. The only thing wish is for me, and yes it is a selfish aspect of the review, for me... I want to be able to step through the screen, through time, and go back to the moments I first saw this film and experience the feeling of wonderment and awe I felt then... except I felt them again 40 years later. Selfishly, I also would want to be able to step through the screen and stand with the actors as they scenes are happening, again. It stimulated me to want to be transported... into the scenes, into the presence of the actors, into the Australian countryside, into time. Even the credits reminded me of greatness... Phil Ramone produced the music. A Rod Stewart song. The endlessly beautiful didgeridoo. Hardly clichés. These are ephemeral things that speak to us. Which is the point of my review. This is a movie that speaks to us regardless of..... anything. Time. Historical knowledge. Anything. It speaks to us. I want to go Walkabout.</fullReview>

The direction by Roeg was spell-binding and he brought incredible work out of the 3 young leads, Agutter, Gulpilil and Roeg. The cinematography is magnificent and the score - more important than the spoken script - is a perfect example of how music and image can support and reinforce each other.My only regret is that there are not more directors of this class to give Jenny Agutter the platform to show her talent as one of Britain's finest actors (and incidentally still one of the most beautiful).</fullReview>

Actually only the aborigine saw her. But it would be interesting to know what he said. It was in answer to her question asking if he had trouble.I first saw this movie in the 70's and it intrigued me from day one eventually drawing me to Australia for an extended visit and camping trip thru the outback.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stunning cinematography (most of the time), and some good points made about the disconnect between cultures, but also incoherent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walkabout is one of those much adored 'cult films' from the late 60s and early 70s where the approach taken by filmmakers on supposedly unapproachable subject matter gets tackled head on and with the ferocity of true art. If it's a great film or not, I suppose, will be subjective. After hearing nothing but raves about the film (albeit not having read some of the negative, or just bits of critical, commentary on it on this site), it seems that the strongest thing that can be recommended about Roeg's work is that it is undeniably original. You won't see something like this at the cineplex, not by a long shot. It's also one of the strangest films from the period, from any country, where mood based on editing and on what is somewhat interpreted or not between the characters is what's meant to be striking hardest. But that doesn't make it strange- what's unconventional about the picture, for better or worse, is Roeg's complete faith in ambiguity, and leaving his storytelling as something of fiction presented as documentary. Think of it as a National Geographic special with two English kids and an aborigine thrown in to drive the imagery forward.But the same lack of exposition that Roeg tends to favor makes his film a little too incomplete. I find it a little odd to hear Ebert say that the film has "superb storytelling", when to me that is probably its least effective area. The premise, for one thing, except for being some obscure abstraction doesn't make much sense: a father has his two kids in the car, and stops so that the kids can have lunch. He looks like he's a geologist, looking at maps, as his daughter (Agutter) sets up a picnic and his son (Roeg's son Luc) plays with toys. Suddenly, he starts shooting at the boy, and the son thinks its a game. The daughter runs with the boy away, as the father then sets the car on fire and shoots himself. Talk about a bright way to send your kids packing! I understand Roeg's motivation for pushing the story like this, at least once the rest of the equally abstract material starts to come forward in the film. But just an inkling of motivation, of explanation, might make it not so much of a deterrence. Once the kids set off on their journey through the Australian outback, however, then things start to gain some momentum, with photography that reminds one of the desert scene in The Good the Bad and the Ugly (or, for that matter, Lawrence of Arabia, which Roeg was an photographer on).Once finding an oasis, and finding it drying out, the kids look like they're in trouble. But an aborigine boy around the same age as the girl comes upon them, helps them get water, and travels along with them. The distance of communication is one of the stronger themes Roeg presents the audience, as the kids keep talking to the aborigine (Gulpilil, who says only one word of English) despite their not being recognition of understanding. It's intuitive, after all, and that too becomes part of the kids' experience on the sort of not eventful adventure. It's refreshing, in a way, to see Roeg not take certain images into incorporation directly with the kids or the aborigine- cutaways to random lizards and sunsets and scorpions and kangaroos don't enter into the plot, per-say, as much as they serve as little visual notes along the way. The distractions come though in Roeg trying to get a lot out of making comparisons between civilized life and the aborigines, in rapid-fire cuts meant to make stark trade-offs between cutting of meat or gatherings (a group of aborigines surrounding the burnt car). And a very random scene with a bunch of scientists feels like the one scene that should have something, anything, to do with the rest of the film, and it doesn't aside from maybe one unnecessary note of sexual tension between the male scientists and a female scientist.The sexual, and just curious, nature of the aborigine and the girl is one of the strangest but most successful of Roeg's touches; it's never said explicitly, but it can be felt as something that builds up over the course of the film. The boy is oblivious, to be sure, as he's the purest innocent in Walkabout, which is important as he's sort of the guide for the audience as something kind of to identify with. But this cultural split, of not quite knowing the other, leads to this curiosity that is more directed from the aborigine to the girl as opposed to the other way around; there's one scene in particular when they're at the house, and the two of them go between rooms, the way its shot and the body language suggests to a point that makes Antonioni look tame by comparison. The very end, as with the beginning, feels rushed and a little stilted when compared to the moments of clarity and (successful) experimenting with moving the film forward via atmosphere, but it must be said that at least Roeg never makes it dis-interesting to watch. It's a pure expression of how one looks at an environment, as an outsider, and relates it to what is from that person's world (or rather, Englishman Roeg in Australia, not too different in terms of looking at it like the English kids). It looks intuitive, if anything, which makes it all the more remarkable on such a tiny budget. By the end, there's almost a feeling of 'well, that was quite, um, something', but mostly in a good way: Walkabout explores what happens when people leave their cultures and connect on some weird plane of existence, and if lacks some strengths as a first (solo) directing outing via fleshing out the story and themes, there's more to it than would usually be expected from a more conventional filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A world full of danger and empty of humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, simply put, is definitely a product of the 70s.It details, roughly, the story of a young girl and her brother who, after a disturbing and tragic event of which I will not spoil, find themselves alone in Australian wilderness, having to survive against all the relative dangers that come with being in such a predicament. The movie, however full of natural dangers, however, does not focus so much upon the survivalism or even will to live so much as upon a coming-of-age involving a very dangerous and empty world.What makes it really distinct is not only said disregard for the civilities of survival-based exposition and important dialog, but the structuring of the film around three general editing devices that pull out a self-consciously artistic sense of malaise: jump cuts, graphic matches, and montage editing. Several times the movie jumps ideas, locales, movements, pacing, shots, with seemingly very little reason, but which is usually just begging to be analyzed and commented upon. This style of exposition is never anybody's favorite, and it's probably for that reason that this film isn't the most well-known film out there.Now of course the film seems to have this strong anti-human tendency, or even a strong anti-nature tendency, but neither of those readings really seem to pull through. All there is in the film is what is, dangerous landscapes and abandoned buildings. This fits completely with the coming-of-age malaise, the ever-present danger and the feeling of complete abandonment, but trying to fit in some sort of anti-human, anti-nature reading into this film is largely missing the point because it's not really taking into account the point of view of the protagonist, the young girl. Can one honestly say she wasn't as intimidated by the nature aspects as by the human? Whatever the case, it is marked mostly by that deranged 70s artistic feel that is more famously felt in such works as Easy Rider and Taxi Driver, which means it's definitely not one of those things that sits well or can even be digested in one sitting.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie because I saw "Rabbit Proof Fence" and wanted to see more films featuring David Gulpilil. He didn't disappoint in this film either - he has an incredible presence on screen.This film comments on so many racial and cultural issues in Australia, and in a way that's so subtle that it unnerves you with you knowing why - I haven't read the book its based on, so I can't comment on whether it stems from there.Two English kids (Jenny Agutter and Lucien John) are taken from their comfortable home in what seems to be Sydney (the harbour bridge is visible in one shot) and taken into outback South Australia by their father (John Meillon), and no explanation is made for this. (Outback SA is MILES away from Sydney, yet they still have their school uniforms on. Why?). The girls sets up a picnic, the boy plays with his water pistol, and suddenly their father starts shooting at them. They escape, and his voice calling after them is especially chilling, but when they don't materialise, he shoots himself and sets fire to the car. The girl knows, and keeps it from the boy. She gives him lemonade and tells him to look after his school blazer and shoes.They're doomed from the beginning - no water, no way of finding their way home. They discover a water hole and fruit tree and camp there, but by morning, the fruit and water are gone - we can only assume its a metaphor for the way Australian settlers ruined their ecosystem. They are rescued from almost certain death by a young aboriginal man (David Gulpilil) on 'walkabout', a coming-of-age ritual. He appears to live a completely 'tribal' existence in that he walks mostly naked and hunts his own food, and can't speak english. The only one able to communicate with him is the english boy, because he's an innocent, not yet corrupted by civilisation as his sister has been.The aboriginal boy leads them to eventual safely, and finds a friend in the other boy. The girl, however, treats the aboriginal boy like a servant and is afraid of him. When they reach safety, the boy dances a tribal dance for them and they don't understand why.The scene where they last see the boy in the tree is especially chilling - the coldness of the girl, and her complete lack of sadness over it. Its as if she's happy to be safe and that's it, and the aboriginal boy has outlived his usefulness. Which is why the final scene, of the girl looking back at an innocent memory of the three of them swimming naked together, doesn't fit.But, maybe civilisation and order is what we cling to in times of adversity, but when we're in it, its a cage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Walkabout" was on my mental list of movies to see for some years, mainly because the critic Ebert has it on his list of great films. I saw it this week, on DVD borrowed from my local county library. As some others have commented, it is not easy to understand what exactly this movie was getting at, but the commentary on the DVD, by actress Agutter and the director, helps much. The characters have no names, they are father, white girl, white boy, black boy.Jenny Agutter was cute and 18 when this was filmed in 1970, playing a school girl about 15 or 16. Much of the film has a voyeuristic feel to it, early filming showing close-ups of her short skirt as she climbed up rocky walls. Later we see her hanging upside down on a tree branch, fully exposing her pantyhose over her white panties. Then later there is a prolonged scene where she is swimming nude alone, but the camera shows quite revealing shots of her bust, her bottom, and her crotch. Later there is a scene where she is dressing, still topless, and near the end she is fully nude as she gets up and walks. Jenny was lovely at 18 (and may still be at 53), but almost anyone would classify her nudity in Walkabout as "gratuitous." She and the director explain how the scenes were necessary to advance the story, and I agree, but they could have been done with a bit more modesty and not lose any impact. Don't get me wrong, I am not a prude and thoroughly enjoyed Jenny's nude scenes, I could watch 2 hours of just her running around and swimming with no clothes on. But in trying to objectively evaluate the film, I think the director just likes to film sexy scenes.some SPOILERS follow, don't read further if you want to be surprised.This movie is about two different stories, and the protagonist in each meet up quite by accident. First we see a girl (15?) and boy (6?) whose father has gone crazy, takes them to the outback for a picnic, starts shooting at them, girl runs to hide with boy, dad shoots himself and torches car, girl and boy with very few supplies start walking, find water hole, fruit, but things are looking gloomy. They just want to survive and get back to their comfortable lives.Second story, native Ozzie at 16 is on traditional 'walkabout' lasting months as his entry to manhood, has to survive on his own, or not. Meets boy and girl, shows them how to get water, kills animals and cooks for food, they don't speak the same language, can't communicate easily. Find a deserted house with water well, they become a temporary family.The "communications" gulf comes to a head. The black boy has decided as part of his entrance to manhood he will take the while girl as his bride and does a courting dance. She has no idea what he is doing, is afraid, next day white boy and girl find him dead, hanging in a tree. he had failed in his quest. They find a road, eventually get back to "civilization."At the end, we she her, in kitchen preparing a meal, husband comes home, smal talk about their kids, she has a mental flashback to her, and brother, and black boy all nude, living happy, at swimming hole. She finally realizes that she might have had a happier life but she as many of us became trapped in the mold that we were raised in.In images but not words the film comments on the absurdity of killing wild animals for trophies, wasting our natural resources. Near the end images of bricks of a building are alternated with images of rock formations in the outback, drawing the contrast in lifestyles, natural vs artificially constructed. A thought-provoking film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the characters in this film. The subtle human interaction is so interesting, a study of human interaction similar to watching a documentary of the wild animals on the Serengeti Plain. Jenny Agutter is perfect as the proper and quiet schoolgirl who is tougher than she looks. She steps into the leadership role effortlessly when she leads her brother through the outback after their accident. Lucien John is my favorite character, what a grand little man! He is so charming and masculine at such a young age. I especially remember when they first meet the Aborigine and he commands his sister to "Ask him for water!" David Gulpilil is the Aboriginal version of Nanook of the North, the noble native who is unspoiled by Western civilization. He exudes innocence and wonder, with never a lascivious look to his attractive young damsel in distress. Nicholas Roeg captures man at his purest form in this film, like Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden before they ate from the Tree of Life. The entire experience is enhanced by an angelic soundtrack.I have a few criticisms of the film. The montages can be a bit gimmicky. They could have done without the butcher inserts because they draw away from the natural beauty of the setting. The images of the animals being killed were a bit gory too. My biggest criticism is with the ending. The suicide seemed totally unbelievable. I bet it was even unheard of in traditional Aboriginal societies. Despite these lapses, Walkabout is a totally mesmerizing and utterly refreshing film that is unlike anything that I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A timeless film that handles topics of love, family, tolerance, prejudice, coming of age, and violence in a way that it should be made mandatory for all students (junior high level would get the most out of it, but there is much for younger and older children as well). At the heart is the relationship between a young boy (the director's son) and a teenage girl (Jenny Agutter) who had been shielded from the harsher aspects of life, but through a consequence of events must explore the world eyes opened and unprotected. The love between brother and sister (and the parental responsibilities of the sister toward the brother) will touch your heart. If you have a sibling (especially a younger brother-older sister relationship) this film is a must see. There are also scenes of violence against animals that can be disturbing but they are presented to introduce such facts of life to the audience. Since it would be impossible to shield such acts in other films or TV, this film is excellent to introduce discussion. The most talked about scene in the film is toward the end where brother and sister bathe nude in a pond, but it is welcomed for it's beauty and acceptence of the natural environment and presented almost in a biblical manner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A damning indictment of civilization's arrogance towards nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An uncompromising film full of so many social messages &amp; metaphors its difficult to know where to begin.Firstly, we shouldn't confuse the title "Walkabout" with the principle story of two middle-class children wandering around the inhospitable Australian Outback. This isn't a walkabout at all!Although never fully mentioned the walkabout refers to a rite-of-passage for young Aborigines who must survive on their own in the Outback for a number of months, hunting for food, finding water and generally being able to survive the harsh &amp; extreme conditions before they are truly marked as an Aboriginal Adult.Secondly, although the main visible theme of the film is one of survival for all three teenagers it hides various secret agendas that you don't initially think about unless you see the film again.The opening scenes for example show us that for all the great progress civilization &amp; technology has provided the "cultured" western world with, we are now no more than human termites, living in high rise buildings, living our humdrum clockwise lives; where everything is done for us by other human "termites" at our behest. We have become processed into a clockwork world where our daily lives follow on repeatedly the same boring existence.The film concentrates on one particular Nuclear family, where the father is far from happy with his lot, although its never clearly explained why he is in such a depressed state. Unexpectedly he takes his two young children (15 year old Agutter and 6 year old Roeg) on a picnic in the Outback. As the children prepare the table their father takes out a rifle and begins to shoot at them before taking his own life.After the initial shock the children realize they have no transport, no telephone, no compass, no map, hardly any food &amp; water, or any idea as to how to get back home.So inside a few minutes director Roeg shows us in quite explicit detail of our dependence on others to make our mundane lives safe yet routine. And yet once we are taking out of that environmental context, along with even the most basic forms of modern technology ( a car or even a map &amp; compass, we are lost in what may as well be a completely different hostile world.But the story doesn't just use that rather obvious juxtapositional cliche, Roeg investigates other diverse cultures &amp; rites that are not all that apparent to our eyes. In spite of the arid conditions the two children are so indoctrinated in their previous middle-class existence they retain their school uniforms, with collars done up and jackets worn because perhaps to their brainwashed minds it would be socially unacceptable to be seen untidy.Eventually their saviour is found in the form of a young Aborigine boy (David Gulpilil) doing his "Walkabout" to earn his manhood. Even though they cannot communicate with each other he provides food &amp; water for them eventually becoming nothing more than their servant even though the two English children show very little appreciation of the fact he has saved their lives. So again Roeg hints at racial, culture &amp; class stereotypes. That in spite of being dependent on this "native" the children are arrogant &amp; ignorant of his human empathy, and instead use him like a slave based purely on the fact he is so "alien" to their rather blinkered culture &amp; upbringing!Another juxtaposition, and perhaps a rather more visually obvious one, is that of sexuality, puberty &amp; adolecence. It's no coincidence that Roeg opted for a teenage boy as the Aboriginal saviour of about the same age as Agutter. Both sexually naive but becoming more &amp; more aware of the opposite sex. The subtle hints are few &amp; far between because Roeg doesn't want to turn the film into some kind of mucky peepshow. However, he does let the camera roam over Agutter's young body,( uniform or not). He then lets us examine Gulpilil's more basic attire yet more aethetically pleasing form before we both see all three children skinny dipping in a pool. The sexual chemistry is so heavy you just feel as if its only a matter of time before the two investigate each other further resulting in a consummated sex scene.But again Roeg refuses to take this rather hackneyed route, so typical of most Hollywood rites-of-passage movies. Instead, he keeps the abstract sexual awakening at a safe distance not wanting us to lose sight of the main story.The ending is perhaps its weakest side because it all becomes painfully predictable &amp; cliched far too conveniently. The contrasts between a man-made brick wall and that of 1 million year old rockface, for example, is clumsy &amp; cheap. After sending out so many subtle metaphors throughout the movie, Roeg throws it all away in a couple of minutes dumbing-down at the end.However, the film generally is a true masterpiece of different cultures, worlds, customs &amp; human needs. Agutter &amp; Gulpilil are both excellent in their parts, while Roeg's cinematography and John Barry's haunting music lives in the mind's eye long after we have forgotten the film's message.Civilization needs Nature more than Nature needs civilization. The more &amp; more we take away from Nature the more dependent we become and we lose our sense of being human &amp; independent. Roeg's message is clear but we have still yet to do anything about it.****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remarkably potent little film about a couple of very proper English kids who get lost in the Australian outback and hitch up with an aborigine boy on his initiation quest (or "walkabout"). My mom took me to see it when I was ten, and I've been haunted by it ever since. With some understated yet disturbing themes of alienation and violence, as well as the first scenes of full nudity I had ever witnessed on screen, I've sometimes wondered whether mom knew what she was getting into when she took me along. According to the trailer in the letterbox edition, Parents' Magazine recommended the film "without reservation" for young and old alike, because it depicts "facts of life." While that may be true, times have changed, and I can't imagine anyone today describing this subtle and unsettling story as "family fare." Incredibly tame, on its face, by today's standards of sensory overload, its essential world-weariness and maturity is no longer a didactic priority in our age of overconfidence. Watching it recently, I was on guard for signs of the myth of the "noble savage"--the hackneyed, simplistic, and generally hypocritical pretension that pre-industrial and non-Western peoples are morally superior to decadent moderns, which is demeaning to both modern and "savage" alike. There are instances of it here--most notably when a couple of rifle-toting, four-wheeling hunters decimate the landscape--but the overall emphasis is on the parallels between aborigine and Western life. Even scenes of the transience and decay of modern civilization are mirrored by the life-and-death cycles of the wilderness. With so many underlying similarities, the real question is why the teenaged English girl cannot embrace, figuratively and literally, the young black man who has saved her life and provided so selflessly for her, even while her younger brother, in all his innocence, has never doubted that they are a family. Is it race? Culture? Or does it reach to more fundamental questions of boy and girl, man and woman, human and human? This film has held up remarkably well over the past 30 years, and is well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One to Watch Again and Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years ago, I saw this movie in the theater. I was pleasantly surprised to see it offered in widescreen as a video. This starts out in an urban setting, and ends in an urban setting, but sandwiched in between is a fascinating tale, with minimal dialogue, excellent photography and first-rate performances from the main three characters, all young. In many ways, this is a "return to Eden" or "what if we could live out our basic desires and dreams?" story. There are painful moments, as there is meant to be, as well as moments that allow us to see inside the souls of the white girl and the Aborigine boy. The sexual tension is primarily implied, and to a great degree in the mind of the young lady -- a kind of racial statement. But for the prudish, be alerted: This movie has nudity involving a teenaged girl. But as Judith Crist said in her review, "The nudity is tastefully handled. Parents and children should watch this together and have a discussion." Most of all, we are given a sight of the Australian outback as the Aborigines have known it for centuries. It is beautiful and primitive in its imagery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I said, I recommend this movie to everyone that ever get into discussions about movies about. I first saw it back in high school on an independent TV station and never heard of it again until I read Paul Theroux's book "The Happy Islands of Oceania". In his book he talked about how it had a cult following, but had been kept out of circulation for years due to some sort of legal entanglements. Whether this is true or not, I was very pleased to see it become available recently on video. I've rented it about 4 times since then to show to friends.Roeg's cinematography is stunning. The contrasting juxtapositions of stone age food procurement and industrialized food procurement are one of the best points made in the movie. My favorite part of this movie is the screen wipes Roeg uses while the little boy is telling the Abo a story as they walk along - stunning symbology! The Aborigine hunting techniques are fascinating, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Walkabout at the cinema when it first came out. I am nearly the same age as Jenny Agutter and in 1971, when we were both 19, there was very little nudity to be found in provincial England: I confess that my main motivation for going to see Walkabout was because I had read that Ms Agutter would be displaying her all in it (as, indeed, she did). However, even as a rather callow and unworldly youth, I managed to perceive that there was rather more to this film than simply Ms Agutter's youthful (and extremely beautiful and rather touching) nakedness.It has taken further viewings over the years, as I have become a little less shallow, to appreciate more of the depths within this movie.The stark beauty of Australia, the brilliant performances from the three young principals, the simplicity and complexity of the story, the underlying thematic complexities and, ultimately the multiple tragedies of the outcome - all I knew back then was that I had watched something special, and even now I am finding out more reasons why it was so special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicholas Roeg's (1971) film, drawn from James Vance Marshall's (1964) book 'The Children' is set in the desert or 'outback' of Australia sometime during the fifties.It's a powerful and disquieting film which confronts the situation of two city children (Jenny Agutter and Luc Roeg) who are orphaned and stranded in a remote and inhospitable area by their father's suicide.At once alone and traumatised, they are befriended by a teenage Aboriginal boy (David Gulpilil) and they accompany him on a journey into territory that is completely unfamiliar to them.Numb to the crisis of being so suddenly orphaned and abandoned, they become focused on ensuring their own survival in an environment with which they ill-equipped to deal.Though their new friend is very much at home in the outback, he is on a journey of his own and at a crisis of a different kind in his own life. He is a alone and vulnerable in a way that is not evident at the beginning of the film.As he completes his task in re-uniting these lost children with people of their own culture, events somehow take them back to where they were at the start of the story.A great film that begins to disentangle the roots of our natural humanity; bridging all cultures and every epoch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish and memorable outdoor adventure story - but spoilt by the need to spring sudden shocks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoiler Alert*An Australian father takes his son and daughter to the Outback and while there commits suicide leaving them stranded.What a strange concept for a film and what a strange director to deal with the subject in Nicholas Roeg; whose C.V includes such a range of films from classic downwards.Generally speaking, his habit of disorientating the audience for no reason does grate and probably has more to do with trying to pepping up the mediocre than adding anything to the story. Thankfully he stays within reason here apart from a reprise scene at the end which serves no obvious purpose.For quick summation this is a three way relationship story: A boy (Luc Roeg) who knows little and doesn't, therefore, differentiate between normal and abnormal and his older sister (Agutter) and an aborigine boy (David Gumpilil) that saves their lives by showing how to live in the Outback.The concept of a couple of kids (although Agutter was really 18) out on their own in the wilderness should have been enough for the script, so why make the father in a would-be murderer. A plane crash was enough for the book so why the drastic change? Trying to add a cheap tension device?This is 1970, but the sense of age is not apparent and the ecological aspects of the piece have never been more pertinent. Here the native Australian kills for food, the white settler for no clear purposes. But why? I couldn't answer that question any more than I can answer why the father acted the way he did in the first place. Don't we deserve to know for sure or at least have more clues?The culture clash and tribal culture come in to sharp focus, but we are given so little before-the-action to work with. Both parties are together, but in their own little world. The aborigine leads them to safety and makes a play for Agutter, but what follows isn't a standard love story, but another tragic culture clash. This story didn't need the start or the end it got for it to be a great film. To see the great Australian outdoors in such fantastic detail with a touching score by John Barry (whose Irish family used to be a neighbour of ours once-upon-a-time!) would have been enough. We could have got the message without the nudity and the violence: or at least made it a little less lingering.Walkabout is one of those films that you will remember forever and is better than many films in the IMDb top 250, but this is not life with the boring bits cut out, more life with a sense of time and place and the quiet moments have to be included to make it seem real. However this is a flawed piece of work which is a great shame, because it could have been a classic with a bit more control, explanation and moderation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most compelling visual and dramatic masterpiece ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 50 years of seeing movies, nothing has affected me like Roeg's Walkabout. If you have ever dreamed of running off and living in the wilderness, this film is for you.The landscape of the Australian outback is the real star of this beautiful film. It must be seen on the big screen to be enjoyed properly. Just wonderful cinematography, outdoors--no special effects (except for a unique "storybook" sequence, the like of which I've never seen anywhere), no lighting. The astonishing beauty goes on and on; I can never get tired of looking at it.On top of that, the story is moving and memorable. Two very proper, white, schoolchildren get lost in the outback, and encounter an aborigine youth who is on a solo walkabout, an adolescent rite of passage. Relying on their new friend for survival skills--an interesting relationship without any language in common--they have to follow his long trek. Naturally, the trip becomes a rite of passage for the white kids, too.The story points up how completely we have lost our sense of place by our addiction to the artifices of civilization. A portable radio, tuned to an educational station, provides the only source of "civilized" information to the youths--its conspicuous irrelevance to their actual life an ironic commentary.The way the lost kids ultimately find their way back to civilization is not dramatic--but the way their return affects their native guide is a real shock. And that seems to be the climax; but there's a further kick in a deliberate anti-climax, forcing us to dwell on the sense of loss that is entailed in the return to civilization."Excellent" is not a good enough rating for this movie. To me, it is absolutely transcendent, virtually in a class by itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great visual experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this (director's cut version) for the first time on a screen measuring 60 x 30 ft and it made a great impact - the only way to see a strongly visual film like this. Survival in the harsh but ruggedly beautiful Australian outback is the principal theme, not just humans in the environment, but men versus creatures and creatures versus other creatures. The symbolism is often heavy and obvious while the imagery is often subtle.The 17 year old girl and younger brother are abandoned by their suicidal geologist father. They are both dressed in school uniforms, clothing reflecting an alien culture and not very practical in the environment they are in. At first the girl insists that they both maintain a smart appearance so as to give a favourable impression to others - but there is no-one around. She wears white stockings which emphasize her "whiteness" in contrast to the darkness of the native aboriginal they later encounter. There is also much subtle eroticism. At one point the girl tells her brother they should eat salt - she puts some into her hands and cups them for her brother to tongue. "It doesn't taste like salt" he says. In a later scene where the aboriginal is present she climbs and grasps the limbs of a tree with her legs and swings her lithe body around. However, she does not comprehend the aboriginal's sexual desire for her. These small examples demonstrate that there is so much contained in this film it requires several viewings to absorb it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating masterwork; one of the best of the '70s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Australia (where the movie takes place), when a male Aborigine turns 16 he is sent out on the land to survive by himself.When I looked at the cover art of the DVD and heard David Gordon Green mention this film on an episode of Charlie Rose, I immediately started imagining what the movie would be like. I had envisioned something of a cross between the visual splendour and muted emotions of "Days of Heaven" and the subject matter and politics of "Rabbit-Proof Fence." And that turned out to be a pretty good assumption.In the opening shots of the movie, which take place in a modern city, there's a didgeridoo in the background. Right away we can tell that Roeg (this is my introduction to him) is a visual storyteller, shunning traditional narrative. There's no dialogue -- the only words come from a weird radio show that must be educational (the host talks about cutlery and dinner etiquette) -- and the camera focuses on two children coming home from school.Once the two children get home (a young boy and a gorgeous adolescent girl who seem to be English, not Australian), the father takes them on a picnic in the Australian outback. He seems to have a strange relationship with the children, and when his son mock-shoots him with a water gun, the father inexplicably abandons the two, permanently. From here, the film gets more mystical: the children come across a tree and water site, and the boy eats a berry from the tree, saying, "Tastes like meat." Roeg puts us in an almost surreal, dreamlike state, and I found myself questioning almost everything I was seeing. When an Aborigine comes jogging down a sandy hill, I wasn't quite sure if he was real or a mirage. Turns out he is real, and obviously he's the boy on his walkabout, though the film is more about the walkabout of the two children, than of the Aborigine that finds them.There's a failure to communicate between the children and the Aborigine, though the boy is able to understand him more than the girl. I liked that the kids had no prejudice towards the Aborigine, too, even if the girl has a little English snobbery (and some possible sexual shyness). On the surface, we're just shown the everyday doings of the three for the majority of the film, until suddenly, one day the Aborigine starts acting strangely around the girl. He starts doing a dance that indicates something we'll see later on.There isn't anything to give away. It's not a movie that has any real emphasis on plot, and I like that. Roeg is interested in his images and his quirks, like when the boy tells the Aborigine a story, and Roeg decides to edit that sequence by wiping away with a turning page from a book.I couldn't stand seeing the animals being killed and beaten for the purposes of a movie, no matter how good. I hope that the Aborigine actor (David Gulpilil), who made his film debut here (and who, coincidentally, played the tracker in `Rabbit-Proof Fence'), was actually a traditional Aborigine like the character he plays, and that Roeg merely filmed his regular activities.Roeg's influences are curious. More than once I felt the inspiration of The Lord of the Flies, though that may be more due to the novel or screenplay (which Roeg didn't write). The children here, however, are unlike those in The Lord of the Flies in that they remain civilized (although the girl does become monotonously serene near the end). While Roeg's contemporary is probably the less prolific Malick, he's differentiated, in one way, because he, unlike Malick, has no narrator (except for the very end, where he has some unseen man reading poetry to make sure we understand the profound nature of what we've seen -- a rare misstep). Like Malick, he relies on visuals, as well as an enigmatic narrative (and a an absence of a clear timeframe). In some instances, Roeg seems almost like a scientist. Whereas Malick would focus on the lush greenery of trees, and animals dying nobly somehow, Roeg focuses on creepy crawlies and more graphic sights, like an animal being opened at the gut, having a hunter stick his hand inside and feel around some organs, and having its blood drain out. Roeg, who did his own (incredible) cinematography makes the barren land look remarkably striking.Early in the film, Roeg's direction is often like that of Kubrick's in the scarier moments of "2001." There are a number of long zoom-ins in the film, as well, that remind me of Kubrick. Another similarity is the buzzing insects highlighted a few times in the film that sound like the horrible noise that comes with the appearance of the monolith in "2001." Roeg's direction makes the early part of the movie fascinating -- I had no idea where he was going. It could have turned into as weird a movie as "2001" at any moment. He symbolically shows a wall, a setting sun, and I really have no idea what it means (if anything). To be honest, there's a handful of heavy-handed symbolism, like one scene where the Aborigine's preparation of a piece of meat is paralleled by that of a modern butcher preparing a piece of meat. The blatantly obvious theme of the movie, that of aboriginal vs. modern industrial, is sometimes interesting, sometimes tedious. Thankfully the movie is much more than a simple summary. Some bits seem to serve no real purpose; we see a group of scientists or meteorologists or archaeologists that seem to exist only so the boy can find one of their escaped weather balloons. One group of hunters (possibly related to the group of scientists) destroy, with heavy gunfire, a number of wild animals, only to leave them to rot.But what makes this a masterwork is what can't be explained.For all movies like this, that aren't really `about' anything, but essentially seem to encompass everything, it doesn't really matter what you say -- you won't have any idea until you see.****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Roeg wave of angst. A great many films are incompetent, so I have my own private parade when I run across one that has a coherent vision and the skill or artistry to make that vision real. This is such. At the end of my parade starts the encounter group I have with my different selves over whether to accept that vision, to enter and inhabit that world.Many of my selves are attracted to Roeg's world. This is a film about the problems of film, about peering into a different world using pure vision. Good. And he uses an all- too-common mode for representing such engagement: sexual attraction. Self-awareness as sexual awareness, and that self-awareness of the character folded into the self- awareness of the viewer and his/her position as distant.Parts of me point out the novel slant on this: interesting plots that are artificially twisted around this notion of separate worlds peering at each other. Other parts celebrate the amazing efficiency and richness of the visual grammar.Where I have problems is the reduction of the grand universe of engagement to the limited playground of sexual obsession. Here and in "Man Who Fell" we have this conceit. When I saw this in 71, I thought it was a cool conflation, because I was part of a whole social movement that made the same mapping. Thirty years later that seems thin, even dangerously, addictively sophomoric. You, dear viewer, may not have the same legacy and need to so aggressively reject this mapping. It may be simply a convenient narrative device. In which case, this will be a fine experience for you.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

But if you look closer, you'll also find a story about civilization, communication and the harsh beauty of nature. Close-ups of creatures dwelling in the desert reveal the circle of life. Death and life are closely related. But what makes us people different from these creatures? Our ability to speak perhaps? But what happens when you can't communicate? Through civilization we learn how to talk, how to walk and how to dress. But we don't learn how to survive in the harsh nature of the wilderness. Which boundaries can love transcend? The characters have no names and very little background information is given. But that's a good thing. This is a timeless story and palpable for all viewers.

		<shortDescription>The Mystery of Communication</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A teenage schoolgirl and her younger brother are left stranded in the Australian outback by a strange sequence of events. Their father, who has driven them far into the wilderness for a picnic, suddenly takes out a gun and begins shooting at them. After they run away he sets the car on fire and shoots himself in the head. Lost in the desert, they would seem to have little chance of survival, until they are discovered by an Aboriginal boy. Although he cannot speak any English, and they do not speak a word of his language, they manage to communicate using sign language and the Aborigine uses his tracking and hunting skills to help the children.Although the film was made by an English director, Nicolas Roeg, it was shot in Australia on an Australian theme and can therefore be seen as one of the earliest films of the Australian "New Wave" of the seventies. Roeg's photography of the outback recalls that of Peter Weir in "Picnic at Hanging Rock", perhaps the best-known "New Wave" film. This was Roeg's second feature film and shows many of the techniques for which he was to become famous, especially extensive cross-cutting and the symbolic use of montage. One of his themes is the contrast between the children's safe, ordered life in Sydney and their ordeal in the desert. The film opens with a brief montage of scenes of the Anglophone city, a place of military parades, of school uniforms, of butcher's shops, of radio broadcasts and of swimming-pools He then reverts to some of these images later in the film; for example, shots of the Aboriginal boy butchering a kangaroo he has killed are intercut with shots of a butcher chopping meat, possibly to indicate that the preparation of food is something fundamental to both cultures. The film is notable for its photography of the landscapes and wildlife of Australia. During the early scenes, when the children are on their own, the bush seems like something alien, harsh and threatening. Later, however, after the Aboriginal boy has joined them, and especially after they discover a lush green oasis, it still seems alien but in a different way. It has now become a place of wonder, of life, even of plenty for those who can understand its secrets. (From a reference to Remembrance Day we learn that the action takes place in November, the Australian spring). The shots of the animals and birds also seem to have symbolic meanings. Creatures like snakes, scorpions, an eagle hovering overhead and a thorny devil seem to symbolise the dangers confronting the siblings, while a possum and a cockatoo in the oasis speak more of nature's bounty. There is much that is mysterious about the film. It is never really explained why the father should have killed himself or have tried to shoot his children, although it is hinted that money troubles may have played a part. It is not explained how the family, originally from Sydney, should have made it so far into the outback. (References to Adelaide suggest that we are now in South Australia). We do not even learn the names of the main characters; they are merely referred to as "the girl", "the white boy" and "the black boy". Yet these gaps in our knowledge should not be regarded as "goofs" or "plot holes". They merely add to the air of mystery which is an important part of the film. In his review Roger Ebert described it as being about "the mystery of communication", and I think this was a perceptive comment. When it comes to the basics of survival, food and water, the siblings and the Aborigine are able to communicate despite their lack of a common language. When it comes to matters of the heart cultural differences get in the way. In a key scene near the end the Aborigine performs an elaborate dance in front of the girl. She simply interprets this as a strange ritual and tells her brother that this is the Aborigines' "way of saying goodbye to people they like", unable to understand that he has fallen in love with her and this is in fact a courtship dance. Difficulties in communication can also arise between people of the same cultural background. At one stage in their wanderings the children find a deserted mining town where they meet an elderly white man but are unable to make him understand they are lost; his only concern is that they are trespassing and might damage "company property". To say that "Walkabout" is simply "about" communication, or "about" cultural differences, or survival, or the relationship between Man and Nature, or the clash of urban civilisations with other, older ways of life would be to oversimplify the film, even though it is "about" all those things and others. It is not a film with a single, obvious meaning, but a hauntingly beautiful, complex cinematic poem in which many meanings can be found each time one sees it. It marked the emergence of the lovely Jenny Agutter as a major star, confirming the promise she had shown in "The Railway Children" the previous year, and of David Gulpilil as the first Aboriginal film star. Mention should also be made of John Barry's fine musical score. It also marked the arrival of Roeg as a major auteur. Although he has not always fulfilled his early promise, "Walkabout" is a masterpiece of the cinema. Roeg was to follow it up with another masterpiece, "Don't Look Now". 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A teenaged girl and her young brother lost in the Outback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walkabout is an unusual film; there are few characters and we never learn the names of those. Set in Australia a father drives into the outback with his teenaged daughter and young son; as the boy plays and the girl prepares a picnic the man starts shooting at them. The girl grabs her brother and they take cover; unable to kill his children the man sets fire to his car before shooting himself. This leaves the two children lost deep in the outback with no idea where the nearest town is or even where there is a road. They head off together heading for high ground hoping that they might see a sign of civilisation. They can't see anything so set off again and eventually find an isolated fruit tree next to a small waterhole. They eat and drink before going to sleep; by the time they awaken the water has dried up and the birds have stripped the fruit. It looks as if they will die here until an aboriginal boy finds them. He doesn't speak a word of English and they don't speak his language but he lets them tag along with him and shares the food he finds with them. Ultimately they find a farm but it has long since been abandoned; it is however near a road and that will inevitably lead the two siblings back to civilisation? whatever that is.This is one of those films that viewers are likely to declare a masterpiece or terrible; I'm inclined to the former view. There is something strange about it; director Nicolas Roeg has filmed it in a way that makes the landscape both beautiful and ugly at the same time; the camera often cuts away to show wildlife; sometimes alive other times dead and decaying. The landscape they walk through often feels so dry one gets thirsty just looking at it. When they meet the young aborigine his language is left unsubtitled so it is as alien to the viewer as it is to the two siblings. As the three of them travel together the aborigine hunts and kills several animals; we also see a white hunter shooting and cutting open a water buffalo; these scenes might disturb some viewers as they look real. Given the '12' certificate some viewers might be a little surprised to see Jenny Agutter, who was sixteen at the time of filming, totally naked; the scenes are innocent though so shouldn't offend anybody. That isn't to say there is nothing sexual about the film; the way she looked at the Aboriginal boy showed that she was coming to terms with her burgeoning sexuality even if she never acted on those feelings. While not everybody will enjoy this film I think it is one of those that all film fans should watch once; even if you don't enjoy it there are interesting things to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Australian survival story may stick with you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walkabout was a movie prominently mentioned when I asked for the greatest Australian movies ever made. Actually there seems to be some dispute over whether it's really Australian or just British. The director, Nicolas Roeg, is British; he went on to direct the classic Don't Look Now (1973). On first viewing I didn't think the movie was great, but parts of it stuck with me all day, particularly actress Jenny Agutter who was stunningly beautiful (and at times totally naked). I gave it a second viewing on Christmas and was won over by the whole film.The basic story is that an English teenage girl (Agutter) and her little brother (Luc Roeg) are stranded in the Australian wilderness after their father goes crazy, burns their car and shoots himself. They wander in search of civilization, encountering only an Aborigine boy (David Gulpilil) who helps them out despite language and cultural barriers and a rough environment.I suppose one could argue that there isn't much reaction from the kids at their dad's death. The girl kind of hid it from the boy and certainly she had to be concerned with getting to safety, but one brief shocked closeup from the girl might have been a good idea. At any rate, Walkabout then becomes in part a survival story and in part a coming-of-age story. The girl and the Aborigine both appear to be 16, on the brink of adulthood, and eventually there is some sexual tension and then tragedy between them. The Aborigine boy performs a dance for her, but she doesn't understand and he kills himself. This is sad, but as we see at the end, clearly the whole incident will stick with the girl for the rest of her life. While in a kitchen with a man, she thinks back to skinny dipping with her brother and the Aborigine out in the Australian desert. It is intriguing to think that, despite the hardships, she didn't regard the experience as only a misery. Walkabout has an exotic background and capable photography, and I look forward to seeing the movie on Blu-ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walkabout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Cannes Film Festival, Golden Palm nominated director Nicolas Roeg (Don't Look Now, The Witches) this is a must see classic. Basically a high school female student (The Railway Children's Jenny Agutter) and her younger brother (Luc Roeg, son of the director) (we never hear their names) are taken for a drive by their geologist father in the outback of Sydney, Australia. Without warning he starts shooting at them, and when they hide he sets the car on fire before killing himself. Now the sister and brother are stranded, and they are walking across this land hoping to find help. On their journey, they meet and are guided by an Aborigine youth (David Gulpilil), who is himself on "walkabout", a banishment ritual from his tribe. He helps them live off the seemingly arid land, e.g. how to get water, and hunting for food, and we mainly see the differences on culture between the girl and the youth. Eventually they do reach a place for help, and it skips to a while later, but she imagines what life could have been like if she, her brother and the youth were still in the outback, naked playing in a deep pool. The landscapes in this film are extraordinary, and the creatures that inhabit it are good too. What is also good about this film is the interesting use of camera-work, in moments documentary style; and editing, tiny points where you see the screen turn into pages turning, flashing images (of a butcher) appear when the youth is killing an animal, and freeze frames. It was number 17 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two children are left to fend for themselves in the Austraillian wilderness where they meet an aboriginal boy on a Walkabout, an initiation ritual. The story itself is unremarkable, but the film making particularly the editing is what tells this films story which is far grander in scope than it would initially lead you to believe. Civilization, technology, innocence, sex, communication, death, rebirth, the cyclical nature of time, are all illuminated in this film through visual and auditory juxtapositions, so many mirror images and sounds end up in this film that it almost overwhelms the story, thankfully it walks that razors edge with a grace, daring, and sense of purpose you just don't see today, at least not at such a technical level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film kind of reminds me of how a lot of movies were made back in about 1970. The abrupt cuts to parallel situations, the back to nature living in the wild themes. Speaking of cuts, they probably would not have killed the animal for a movie these days. The movie suggests that our industrial society is killing us inside and that we are unable to get back to our natural state. The 6 year old boy can learn to communicate with the Aborigine but the 14 year old girl with the immaculately pressed skirt and never-greasy hair, cannot because she is contaminated by the industrial culture. The rusty mine equipment once again reminds us of the decay of our rotting culture. I wish some solutions or answers were presented.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a crush on Jenny Agutter. I rented every movie of hers I could find. Walkabout is a challenge. Two kids are lost in the Australian outback. They are led to safety by an Aborigine on his walkabout, a desert journey he must make to prove his manhood. The movie reflects the racial equality coming into vogue after the Vietnam War. Director Nicolas Roeg highlights the sexual tension between Jenny and the black Aborigine. It is curious that a decade later Jenny would play Desdemona in Shakespeare's Othello. Walkabout draws a sharp contrast between civilization and nature. The city seems unnatural and artificial at the film's end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bonjour Tristesse Tropique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicholas Roeg has this thing for sex and hidden menace. He even turns the fork of a tree into an obscene photograph. And the teen aged Jenny Agutter is no help either, running around in this skimpy skirt or in her underwear or sometimes nothing at all, which is nice. Meanwhile anything can happen. There's death around every corner.It's a simple story on the face of it. A father -- one of those Richard Cory types -- takes his kids (Agutter and Luc Roeg) for a drive into the desert. He parks the car for a picnic in the middle of nowhere and tries to shoot them -- rather a shocking moment since the film hasn't set it up. Failing that, he sets fire to the car and blows out his brains.The two kids must get home but they go about it in the dumbest way imaginable. Instead of following the car's tire tracks back to a road they take off in a random direction. And, really, since they were driven inland from Sidney (Adelaide in the novel), they ought to head east towards the sea, meaning they should walk towards the rising sun.But, man, these kids are out of their element. If it weren't for their accidentally running into aboriginal David Gumpilil, they wouldn't get very far. Fortunately he knows how to extract a living from what seems to be a most unpromising environment. He hunts and he gathers, as hunters and gatherers do, and there are some unpleasant scenes of real animals being speared to death. It's like watching a movie in Anthropology 101. Still, Gumpilil kills only to eat, and otherwise lives in harmony with nature.Roeg's film alas contrasts Gumpilil's cheerful optimism and, finally, his mortal love for Agutter, with the ways of the white folks. They seem uniformly nuts, wasteful, and unfriendly. They shoot and kill buffalo for no evident reason and leave the carcass to actively rot -- and I mean "actively." A nice close up shot of a decomposing buffalo's mouth crawling with maggots. Gag me with a spoon! The ways of the white folks are represented mainly by abandoned farmhouses and an abandoned mine, filled with rusting junk.It's an odd story. For all the troubles they've been through, neither Agutter nor her brother seems particularly disturbed. After their father eats his gun, there's no reaction to it, and there is only the briefest reference to it late in the story. Luc Roeg asks Agutter why his father killed himself and she brushes it off with, "I don't know." I don't know why he's dead either. I don't know why Gumpilil props himself up in a tree and dies after courting Agutter in this spooky manner. Maybe it was something he ate. If Roeg's view of Western civilization is justified, somebody should have explained to Gumpilil that it's best for him to have nothing to do with any of them, Agutter's definitive nubility notwithstanding. But these two deaths, like many other things in the film, go unexplained, as they might in real life.There's a tacked-on epilogue with Agutter married but still dreaming of her walkabout. A. E. Houseman's poem makes it all seem wistful and full of contentment, although that's not exactly what the film has shown us. What we've witnessed is a tragedy in slow motion, sometimes languorous. When musing about the largely unexplained and partly accidental character of the narrative, the director had an interesting observation. It's rather like life, isn't it? It has a beginning and an end. "You're born and then you die, and everything in between is an anecdote." In any case, you are guaranteed to have a hard time shaking this one out of your memory.</fullReview>

The nude scenes are necessary as they give a sort of innocence to the character and are entirely believable. The scenery is superb and true to life. The story is hard to believe but truth is really often stranger than fiction. I really couldn't see where the scientists with the balloon came into the story and it was as though they had edited it from another film. The whole scenario is very simple but I had no trouble believing it. I have just rented it again on DVD and enjoyed it as much as I have done in the past.</fullReview>

It could almost be an illustration of Simon and Garfunkel's classic song Sounds of Silence, the way it deals with lack of communication - and the contrast between rural and urban societies.Just make sure you see the uncut DVD version, as the trimmed TV version misses out a key scene near the end which throws an entirely different light on the story.********SPOILER ALERT!!*************It's where the Aborigine boy meets a friend whom the girl doesn't notice, and it becomes clear that she's right on the edge of a community rather than miles away as she thinks. The boy is therefore not taking her back to civilisation as she wanted him to, but has his own purposes in taking her on his walkabout.

		<fullReview>Abandoned in the Australian Outback, a fourteen year old girl and her little brother stagger around until they are saved by an Aborigine boy on his six month walkabout. Director Roeg captures the details of the sunburnt landscape, the flora and fauna, and renders them like Ansel Adams portraits. Roeg's mysterious cinema tricks must have impressed Terrence Malick (Badlands, Thin Red Line); Malick often peels Roeg's images out of this film and pastes them right into his own work.The story is mainly a vehicle to get Roeg into the Outback with a camera. And given that he served as David Lean's photographer on Dr. Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia, the setting is a safe bet. Maybe the THIS IS AN ALLEGORY gets thick at times, but the spare dialog, especially the long silences, constantly draw attention away from any obvious literary device. Besides, Roeg's rich cinematic vocabulary (jump cuts, deep focus, parallel motion, stills) give the film such a sense of wonder, there's no telling what he wants us to think. Walkabout has so much gorgeous scenery that you'll want to hit pause, grab a Fosters, then sit back marveling at the pretty pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Social Commentary - ***Spoilers***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Walkabout" is, on the surface, a survival move. Two kids, one a teenage girl and her school-age brother, are taken deep into the Outback by their father, presumably for a picnic. Tragically, he is over the deep-end psychologically, and intends to kill them. His plan goes afoul, they escape, and instead he kills himself after torching the car, stranding his kids in the desert. They are left to their own, limited skills as the try to make it back to civilization. They don't fare too well and are soon on their last legs when an adolescent aborigine, on his rite-of-manhood walkabout (living off the land by oneself for months), finds them. The two kids accompany him on his walkabout, hoping to get back to civilization. But this is more than just a story; it is a metaphor for the clash between nature and industry, between primitive society and Western. This is 1971 so guess who the bad guys are. And symbols are everywhere in every scene. Sometimes the director stops the plot and films a symbol; an insect, lizard whatever. Psychosocial politics aside this is a very well made movie on every level. It's a movie to view with friends, and then talk about. Maybe see it again. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in 1971 when it was released, and it made an imporession on me that lasted until the present. How many movies can I say that about? Two or three. Does that put this on my top-ten list of best movies? Yes, in retrospect, I think it does. The scenery and concept are spectacular, and the three children are perfect. The storytelling is cryptic and in many cases opaque -- what does the director mean us to conclude from that bit of sound, that brief intercut. Maybe I resented not understanding at first, but 30 years later I appreciate the magic. This movie planted seeds in my heart and in my spirit that have taken decades to grow. It was fascinating to revisit the film for a third or fourth time with the stout outgrowths in control of my life. This is a big movie, even if it doesn't seem so at first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Outback has never looked so inviting, nor scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1971 Nicolas Roeg made a stunning cinematic masterpiece which was set in the Australian Outback. Filled with Roeg's usual camera artistry and symbolism, this film lacks some of Roeg's usual heavy handed pretentiousness. In other words, you've got the best of Nicolas Roeg's talents in one film, that every film student should be required to view at least once in her's or his' life. The story is really simple actually, it has Father (John Meillon) who drives his daughter (Jenny Agutter) and son (Luc Roeg, the actual director's son) into the Australian Outback for a desert picnic (huh??) just so he can attempt to kill them and then kill himself (double huh??), incidentally they are left stranded with no way to get back (the car went boom with the dad!), and they journey forth to explore (in the surrealist of ways) the blossoming of the girl's sexuality while walking to civilization (triple huh???). But it's completely brilliant! On their way they meet up with a young Aborigine, who is on an old Aboriginal rite-of-passage (that he must survive the Outback). This Aborigine helps the girl and her younger brother survive the trek. While the movie does spend most of it's time traveling with three of them, the scenic photography is absolutely breathtaking. I would never have thought that the Australian desert could look so surreal and beautiful. The film explores many issues of budding sexuality of both the Aborigine and the girl, the class system of master and servant, the wastefulness of the modern man versus the original Aboriginal tribe, and the man made world versus the natural. For example, in the beginning we see the girl swimming in a swimming pool that's part of the home, but if you look beyond the picture you can see the wide open ocean which is not as desirable to swim in. We as human beings prefer our civilized world to that of our natural habitat. It seems somehow like a rite-of-passage for the girl as well, to be immersed into a natural existence to be then fit to live in the civilized version. But in this film, everything civilized is looked at as a grotesque example of modern man. After a while we see so much beauty in the Outback, that the living standard for all three seem to be so much more desirable. To be honest, anyone who has seen this film could write a thesis that would go on pages and pages. So I'll keep this short, and say that it's really a hypnotic masterpiece filled with stunning imagery and ideas that can't be shaken off easily. I can't recommend this film enough. The acting by all is top notch as well, with a great haunting soundtrack by John Barry (which strangely has a similar score to "Diamonds Are Forever" that was released the same year!) Not to mention a great "Head Film" to boot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I *finally* got to see this film all the way through. The photography is beautiful and the story can be enjoyed on a most basic level, but what struck me about Walkabout was what it *didn't* say. Roeg wisely pulls his camera back and avoids graphic "suffering in the desert" details or the separate story of the search. The subtlety emphasizes that this film is an extended allegory. My favorite plot device: the children's only link to "civilization," a portable radio, is first heard playing the things a middle class English girl in Australia might listen to--music, lessons, etc. As isolation sets in, it degenerates to a meaningless babble about economics, philosophy and civilization (the same announcer? a different one? is she imagining her father's voice? We don't know). The film is about non-communication throughout. The family is isolated before the fact. The young tribesman can't comprehend the girl's non-understanding of his culture. And the rather depressing ending shows us that the social and cultural isolation we all live in does not easily change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beautiful. Just beautiful. When I was expecting another particular survival story, Roeg showed me an amazingly peculiar one. Set in the harsh regions of Australia (The exact location in the continent, in my opinion, doesn't matter) two kids, a 14 year old girl and her 6 year old brother, are abandoned by their father (He also tries to kill them but fails) who eventually sets their car on fire and kills himself. With no means of transport and no civilized humans around, the kids simply head out into the wilderness. They soon encounter an Aborigine boy who's on a "Walkabout": an Aborigine ritual which involves surviving in the wild for months with the aid of hunting skills after the adolescent reaches a certain age. Thence begins a beautiful and pure journey where the three characters try to outlive the harsh environment with the hunting skills the Aborigine boy possesses. Right at this moment, I am spellbound by this film's images and I will admit that I got to witness a new face of cinema today. Instead of showing us a sweet conventional survival story, Director Nicholas Roeg dwells on narrating the story in a different and thought-provoking manner. The film has been given a complex and layered narration that is a bit ambiguous. Through smart editing and significant number of freeze frames the director, during the Walkabout journey, tries to compare the two completely different cultures of men. One scene is particularly my favorite where the film alternates between the Aborigine boy butchering a Kangaroo and a butcher in some civilized city doing the same. These astonishing moments question the very nature of human beings. Whether we are lost in some unknown, remote and harsh region of the world or are behind the brick walls of the concrete jungle, we are all simply trying to survive in this cruel world. Roeg never even gives us a clear idea why the father attempts to kill his children and suicides. Though, that is a clear indication of the fact that the father couldn't survive in the civilized world. He was too weak that is the reason why he gave up his life.This film leaves the complexity of the civilized world (Symbolized by the car burnt down by the father) and follows a journey on the beauty of companionship and purity of life. Yes, Pure is the keyword here. We are transported back to the age when everything was "Pure". The film's wonderful finale is the most powerful testament of this aspect. Sometimes certain situations arose in the film when the children are extremely close at getting discovered and saved by civilized people but aren't. At this point, Roeg's camera briefly focuses on these people and shows us what they are doing. There are certain thought-provoking messages hidden in these scenes which, of course, I will not reveal here and will allow you, my dear readers, to discover it's beauty by yourselves. And then there's the spellbinding cinematography and Roeg's amazing direction. Both capture the wilderness very meticulously and the "pillow shots" (A curious shot where the camera focuses on the surrounding elements, for brief moments, of the environment where the action takes place) makes the film more believable. There are beautiful shots of birds, trees, reptiles, the stark desert, the sunrise/sunset, etc. that fills the film with fresh images of mother nature. Walkabout is a beautiful and complex near-masterpiece film from the land of Australia. Just walk into Walkabout and you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film yesterday night and at the end of it I was puzzled. I couldn't understand the whole meaning of it... it took me a while to understand the sense of the story: this film wants to show how the two cultures (white people and Aborigenes) just can't "touch"... It shows how non existing the contact between them is. I absolutely love how it was shot. I like when the camera, what the viewers will see... is what they see, or they saw, or they're seeing: it gets you more into the film. The film, I think, wants to shock, and its bond to! I think that the message is that the white culture is destroying itself, and white people destroying themselves. When the father tries to kill them, he does it (I think) because he's gone mad, because he doesn't have a scope... Because the life in the cities, in the civilized world is frustrating compared to the "Walkabout" in the wild... When in the first shots you see the girl at her school, when you see her face, and when you compare it when she's with the Aborigenes, it's completely different, and she is happy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicholas Roeg's 'Walkabout' is a unique and remarkable film. Stunningly photographed (by the director himself), it presents the greatest contrast I've ever seen between Humankind and Nature. The point has been made that the film bears some resemblance to '2001: A Space Odyssey,' and as odd as that may sound, it's a valid comparison. Instead of two insignificant men hurled into the immense void of space, here we have a teenaged girl and her younger brother lost in the vast emptiness of the Australian Outback. Dialog is spare in both films, and secondary to understanding its meaning. And the meaning in both films is not handed to us on a platter, so that the viewer must work to draw his or her conclusions, a task that proves to be eminently worthwhile.As was the case with '2001,' the actors are subservient to Roeg's overall vision, which is the star here. But in this film the principals are on the screen almost all the time, and no one who sees it is likely to forget these characters: Jenny Agutter as a properly-raised schoolgirl who can't leave the propriety of "civilized" behavior behind even in the primeval environment she finds herself in; Lucien John (Luc Roeg) as her younger brother who demonstrates a child's extraordinary capacity to adapt to situations that older persons would find almost impossible to deal with; and David Gulpilil as the Aborigine youth who finds them on his "walkabout" and provides a link to a primitive past that is still a part of all people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some of the best cinematography I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Australia is beautiful, though of course for the girl (played by Jenny Agutter) and her small brother (Luc Roeg) one can see how it would be hell. There seemed to be stretches of nothing in the movie, though, then things would just happen. The plot seems to be desperately trying to make a point, but I'm not certain what it is. The relationship between the English girl and the Aborigine boy on his "walkabout" was poignant and very well-played. The little white boy was a perfect foil for his sister, and is probably what keeps her sane. The end is terribly baffling, so don't expect a real resolution here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film can be described in many ways, though it's not for the regular movie-watcher. The structure of this movie resembles that of "2001: A Space Odyssey" in that it consists mostly of images and has very little dialogue. This is a very pretty movie to look at. There are so many breathtaking images to see in this film that it's impossible to list them. The cinematography in this film is almost other-worldly. While watching this film, it seems as if you're being transported to another level of reality. Jenny Agutter is a beautiful sight to see. She looks so stunning in this film, back in the days when she had really long hair. For some people, this film may be hard to "get". But then again, it's not for everyone....it's not a conventional film. It does get kind of tedious after the first hour or so. Nonetheless, it's a great film. A film like this demonstrates just how wonderful the art of filmmaking can be. Sometimes images speak louder than words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Staggering in its vision and scope, but not very emotional...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinematographer Nicolas Roeg turned first-time director here with a highly visceral and thought-provoking film about two Australian city children stranded in the hot, dusty Outback. They meet a young Aborigine and hope he will lead them back to civilization. Lots of artistic shots of insects and extreme closeups of fascinating reptiles have convinced people this must be a masterpiece (funny, Randal Kleiser's "The Blue Lagoon" had similar shots, and no one praises that!). The story exposition is rather muffled, and the finale is pretentious, but Jenny Agutter certainly gives the film a boost (her beauty is astonishing, especially in a memorable nude swimming scene). Overall, Roeg's position on these characters and their plight feels somewhat indifferent; he's as aloof from them as he is from the audience, and the viewer may walk away feeling they were abandoned as well. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

Tedious pacing (meant to be "deliberate"), obscure editing tricks (meant to be "inventive"), TERRIBLE, confusing storytelling (meant to be "elliptical"), poorly defined characters (meant to be "symbolic"), in an allegory that probably only Roeg himself understands fully, yet it has people writing (quite eloquent) essays on it.

		<fullReview>If a nature documentary Attenborough style chooses the choicest shots, the majestic voice-over and score to elicit maximum excitement and wonder, Roeg's Walkabout does the opposite. It does not seek to amaze, but present an unflinching look at the Australian outback, where at any time you could be hundreds of kilometres from the nearest petrol station. Roeg shoots with a tenacity for the fauna and flora; horny lizards bathe in the ember sun, wombats prod at sleeping children, ant and flies are ever constant. The temptation to err and fleetingly capture Uluru in all its size and iconicity is rejected. He will zoom into a random incident of an animal devouring another, giving it no symbolic power but simply showcasing the harshness for what it is. And then he will zoom out from our characters, contextualising them and making them tiny amongst the crimson red hills of sand. Barry's score, with its cacophony of bleeps, high pitched shrieks, radio static and echidna paws trampling up dust, adds a hallucinogenic mood and makes the great stretches of land vast and infused with a haunting beauty. The trees respond to this and seem to shiver in the hot wind. Sometimes, he will forgo hard cuts and dissolve cliffs and mountains and other scenery against each other, as if to represent passing of time. But he never puts a definite marker on these periods; a crucial element of the story is the vagueness of this perception, as the pair wander confused, lost and desperate. Prior to this wandering, there is a wordless intro of sorts, where we survey the image of modernity in 70s Adelaide, but against the backing of a didgeridoo. Roeg is selective about inserting hints of this world with our main narrative. As our nameless Aboriginal boy on his walkabout hunts and skins a kangaroo, we crosscut over to a butcher who mimics the same actions; who tears at tendons with his hands rather than his teeth, but the intent is the same. Dangling and playing around trees is compared to a group of Indigenous women having their fun in the now burnt husk of the car. And in one moment where the two collide, and Barry's score kicks into a haunting gear, and we freeze-frame on animals escaping and reverse this again and again. But I do think in this instance it is a tiny bit over dramatic - it may be in little Luc's perspective, but is the objective of hunting quite so different? And then there is something which they both share, because it is the inescapable nature of humans. Jenny Agutter was 17 by the time that filming began and it was even more appropriate, as she neared adulthood. She has to continually reign in his younger brother, whom is oblivious to the situation, as well as deal with her developing sexuality. The sensual glances from the Aboriginal boy (and I think from the father too at the beginning, very subtly, who has recognised her physical growth) mirror those of the weather scientists towards their female colleague. Two teenagers will share glances at sensually formed branches in the dark, and as she explores the ruins of an old shack and the burial mounds of the inhabitants, he ha a wide grin on his face as he looks over. Roeg intercuts this with a extreme closeup of a termite burrowing its way out of the dirt ground, as if trying to form a conscious connection between the two worlds, but it is in vain. Likewise, when he performs a ritualistic mating dance, with clay smeared body paints, she shys away because she does not understand. But in some ways, in the stripped dialogue between the siblings, she does know a little. She is embarrassed of her nudity and hurries to clothe herself as he dances to the didgeridoo, but earlier, she is much more at ease twisting and sliding her way through the crystal clear pool, and there is almost a conscious sense of display at work. She understands a little then, but does not fully grasp this experience, even as Roeg fast forwards and presents us again with the image of modernity, inside that identical dainty little kitchen for the housewife. And we dissolve again, and she flashes back to that idyllic time in the pools. It is a remarkable achievement to make a film so balanced, so unbiased, so thoughtful of both sides - Roeg does not attempt to fetishsize the mystic power and authentic natural living of the Aboriginals in the outback, and there is no reward for the pursuit of it after throwing away the cityscape life. The boy is resourceful, but not in a wondrous way. The modern citizens are not caricatures for the way of harsh contrast (except perhaps for one fleeting moment at a plantation). And Roeg, having done this in 1971, as a British director, has a remarkable sensibility for the cultures involved, even as Aboriginal racial tensions waver today. The final scene is poetic powerful and completely devoid of any cultural, racial or sexual prejudice. But it becomes lost in time and memory. It is a dream, after all.</fullReview>

The father is disturbed and starts shooting at his kids. He sets the car on fire and kills himself. They walk off into the wilderness. With dwindling supplies, they find a watering hole and a fruit tree. When even that has gone, an Aboriginal boy (David Gulpilil) encounters them.This is visually arresting. It's about the life in the desert more than any rolling sand dunes. The story is about Jenny Agutter's character. This is her walkabout. It's her coming of age with her sexuality. It's also her protective instincts with her brother. The movie starts with her protecting her brother from her father and her father's death. It also lays out the differing cultures. The intercutting between various sequences delivers its powerful message. It's a truly memorable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsettling but compulsive viewing - 74%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other than spawning a franchise of Aussie-themed pubs/clubs in the UK, the only thing I associate this movie with was the sudden (and it has to be said, sustained) interest in Jenny Agutter in male viewers across the land. But "Walkabout" is like many of the dramas that emerged during the early Seventies in that it's well made but doesn't always make a lot of sense. It reminded me, weirdly, of "Vanishing Point" although there's less that happens here - the minimal cast, largely improvised script and uncomfortable setting makes for a much more visceral experience. And while its tale of cultures clashing makes for compulsive viewing, there is a sense of unease about the thing that might put you off.Driven by their father (John Meillon) into the Australian outback for a picnic, a teenage girl (Agutter) realises that he has other motives on his mind. As her father opens fire on her and her younger brother (Luc Roeg), they both run for cover before she sees her father shoot himself in the head and set fire to their car. Stranded in the desert and surrounded by the creatures that live there, they slowly wander through the terrain hoping for rescue. But they encounter a Aboriginal boy (David Gulpilil) on his walkabout - a rite of passage where they must live off the land before becoming a man. Aided by their mysterious friend and his survival skills (despite not sharing a language), the children's hopes for a return to civilisation increase."Walkabout" can, at times, be a brutal watch as animals are seen speared, shot and dismembered in graphic detail. It offers an unflinching look at a land and people largely untouched by our civilisation, one that often seems as alien to us as anything from outer space. But the film doesn't shy away from turning the spotlight on us, asking you questions that you might not like the answers to. Are we any better than the Aborigines because we hunt for sport with rifles and jeeps as opposed to spearing animals for food? Despite the lack of anything really interesting happening, the film is a compulsive watch thanks largely to the young cast. Agutter leads in a fearless performance as the bewitching schoolgirl although little Roeg (director Nicholas Roeg's son) also does well as he seems to have most of the dialogue. In between scenes, close-up shots of endless bizarre animals add to the unusual atmosphere while Gulpilil's performance feels frighteningly authentic.It can feel a bit of a head-trip but "Walkabout" is a good example of a movie working despite having little behind it. I wouldn't call it entertaining - it's much too bleak for that - but it's certainly interesting, both from a narrative and production point of view. With no effects, very little music other than what can be heard from the transistor radio the children have with them and little to explain what is actually going on, the film has to work hard to hold your attention and it succeeds, just. It's an unsettling attempt to compare our society with one that will be utterly foreign to 99% of its audience and while it's a brave thing to look in the mirror, it might have been nice with Nicholas Roeg wasn't using one he'd borrowed from a circus tent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exit from Eden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been written about the cinematography of "Walkabout" and it's certainly a beautiful film, with amazing visuals of nature in the Australian outback, but also contrasting shots of the built environment of modern civilization. Certainly anyone interested in a visually stunning film should check this out and few will be disappointed.Looking at it as a broader film, it's still very interesting. The story of a brother and sister abandoned in the Australian outback and surviving with the help of an Aboriginal teenager, it feels like an experimental film at times but has a coherent and easy to follow story at its heart. I chose to interpret it as a pretty straightforward story about humans rejecting their simple roots as hunter/gatherers to live in the built, civilized world where meat comes from the butcher, and the regret at having made that trade off, at having given up Eden to live tediously in the city. The film certainly lays on this sort of symbolism heavily. This sort of story might be enlightening if I hadn't seen and read it so many times before, but nevertheless it was done powerfully here and provided me with something to think about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that is beautiful and strange in equal measure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After attempting to kill them and then subsequently committing suicide himself, a man leaves his two children stranded in the middle of the Australian outback. A chance meeting with an Aboriginal boy who is out on his walkabout initiation offers a chance of survival for these kids who are completely out of their depth in such an unforgiving environment.Walkabout was directed by famed cinematic innovator Nicolas Roeg. Along with films such as Picnic at Hanging Rock and Wake in Fright, it formed part of the cinematic movement that has since been described as the Australian New Wave. These were a collection of films made in Australia that explored aspects of the country that had hitherto not been dealt with cinematically. Walkabout is notable in several ways, both stylistically and thematically. It contrasts western urban civilisation with the primitive indigenous culture. The clash is most obvious between the city children and the Aboriginal boy. But despite the fact that the latter is unsubtitled the whole time and whose actions aren't always clearly understood, it's the city culture that is presented as insane. For instance, the opening voice exercises that the girl school work on seem quite bizarre, while several of the white characters we meet along the way act in ways that are at best strange and at others coldly callous. The film often contrasts the beauty of the natural world with the functional human habitations and the rotting junk they leave behind. The children connect to the Aborigine differently too, the young boy is able to communicate and relate to him in an instinctive way that the older girl cannot as she has already been too processed by her culture to the extent that she finds it much harder to connect. The implication is that the civilising effect takes us away from something pure, some kind of innocence the youngster has not as yet lost.As it is, the girl (Jenny Agutter) and the Aborigine boy (David Gulpilil) become a source of sexual fascination for one and other. But while there is palpable sexual tension, theirs is a doomed romantic attraction. The boy never understands that what the girl really seeks is to return to her home. The language barrier prevents communication beyond the basic but the boy clearly thinks his encounter with these white children must be simply part of his walkabout initiation; another part of becoming a man. Sadly, this leads him to engage in a tribal mating dance thinking it is the logical thing to do, which unsurprisingly freaks the girl out. The result is his suicide because he thinks he has failed the ultimate test, the tragic irony of course is that he has inadvertently carried out a great deed worthy of any man in saving these children from certain death. He seems oblivious to this just as he is unaware what the children really seek, illustrated brilliantly in the scene where he encounters a white girl near a settlement, the children never see her nor the white community, never knowing how close they are to what they seek.Walkabout is an adventure-drama that is very minimalist in most ways. It has nameless characters, a basic narrative and sparse dialogue. The scene where the father tries to kill his children is partly so effective because there has been absolutely no build up to it. The small cast all do excellent work but ultimately its director Roeg's film. This one-time cinematographer ensures that this is a movie that is visually incredible at all times. The Australian outback is the right shape to fit a widescreen frame beautifully and Roeg makes the most of this when he captures the landscape, plant and animal life in consistently interesting ways. His famed bold editing techniques are evident too with some juxtapositions of images that sometimes highlight themes and other times disturb. He also uses freeze frames to add to the beauty but which also adds to the strangeness. It's also one of those films with abundant nudity that never feels exploitative in any way but natural and important to the overall whole. In the final analysis, this is one of the most beautiful looking films you are likely to see and for that alone it's worth watching. It's one of those films that just gets better and better every time I see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicolas Roeg's "Walkabout" seems like an extraordinarily raw survival adventure at first glance, what with the tale of two youngsters duking it out in the Australian outback with only an Aborigine lad separated by his tribe as their only hope. What it fully explores, what resolutions it conjures up ? I can only explain briefly here as I am still pondering myself. Had Hollywood made this film they would have transformed it into an overly simplistic and pretentious tale that ends with both sides learning from one another ? the children learning about nature and its 'holiness', and the indigenous lad picking up a few modern skills or two, and of course he and the girl get together. This is not that movie.I've been away from home for about two years now, studying abroad. I wouldn't consider myself an actively social person ? not in the slightest. During my time abroad I have met countless people ? all of them interesting, some of them I have trouble communicating at first. It isn't just that I find most of these situations awkward ? there are some beliefs and ways of people that I simply cannot comprehend about them ? and for that matter, I wouldn't blame them for feeling the same way towards me and others too. We all have our own opinions, thoughts, beliefs, dreams, hopes ? we all pick different variations towards those. If we were to meet a person who is willing enough to understand us without compromising their own beliefs, then we are blessed. "Walkabout" is about the failure of this communication system. None of these characters are able to fully understand one another, even though two of them are brother and sister. At the end of the movie all three are ultimately lost, one way or another, and will never return to the way things were.How they get lost is presented in a series of thought-provoking thematic explorations Roeg and his writer Edward Bond concocted (in a mere 14 pages reportedly), basing off a novel by James Vance Marshall. The two children are abandoned in the Outback by their suicidal father, having been corrupted by and finally given up on modern civilization. Now as nature seeks to claim these unprepared youths, a lone Aborigine male who happens to be wandering the wilderness stumbles upon them.This boy sees them and is intrigued, and they as well. The little boy imitates the young man in certain survival skills ? the girl does not communicate and is aloof with her own thoughts, naively unaware of her blooming sexuality that is now captivating the young man, and perhaps her father too, in the wrong way. The failure of communication becomes complete when the girl rejects the boy flatly as he performs a mating ritual in front of her, in a desperate act to charm her.A quick internet search also reveals the meaning of the title 'walkabout' ? a rite of passage where adolescent Aborigines go on a journey into the wild for about half a year in order to attain a certain level of spirituality. The film examines this by asking whether such enlightenment can be destroyed by the presence of a toxic communication. The boy and girl were raised by civilization, the young man by nature. Both clash, both fail to understand each other, and ultimately both end up getting more lost than before, because once they were lost in a sea of ignorance and presumptions, now they are forever lost in uncertainty and wonder, permanently changed, never being able to return to the way things were ? haunted by the very idea that will haunt them for the rest of their lives.In between the main plot we have side-views of how mankind has completely lost their touch with nature ? one shows a research team who loses a weather balloon, another shows a plantation. Roeg's cinema- verite camera makes these scenes and people in it feel pessimistic and unwholesome ? I believe that was on purpose and helped prove the point that the future has overwhelmed the past and left their people confused and lost. One of the plantation workers even sees the young indigenous man, but he does not respond. The film wisely refuses to answer the question 'why did he do that?'Roeg was a cinematographer before he made this film, and his unique cinema-verite style gives the wilderness scenes a raw edge that shows off the Outback as a place of unforced beauty. There are random shots of animals in the outback, none of them taken in a cutesy-manner, and shows them as graphically nature would ? survival of the fittest. There are some brilliant sequences where Roeg and his editor Antony Gibbs juxtapose the hunting and slaughter sequences with random shots of a butcher simultaneously chopping meat. Times have changed but some things stay the same, even if the tools are different.Roeg's film is profoundly beautiful, unmatched by many, but also deeply pessimistic. It is a tale of losing yourself into nature, but not one where the outcome is positive. The stakes are much higher than a matter of life and death. It's about living and wondering, whether we can truly understand what it feels to live in an environment where nothing makes sense to us, and can transform us in ways that makes us fail to appreciate what we have left. A brilliant thought, yes, but very, very depressing for the lonely and misunderstood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walkabout if you have to, but see this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember a review written about this film when it was first released in Australia in 1971. I won't mention the lady's name, or the newspaper she represented but the review was terrible and I remember thinking to myself "well, nobody will be going to see THIS clunker". How that lady must have eaten her words! Today, "Walkabout" is thought of as a modern classic, and since I've just had the privilege of watching it for the first time, it I can understand why. Mysterious and beautiful, "Walkabout" is a stunning meditation on white civilisation in an age of so-called "reason", which appears to be dragging nature over an apocalyptic cliff of indifference and destruction. For a film with such threadbare narrative structure, "Walkabout" never bored me, as if there was always something going on even though it wasn't being directly talked about on-screen, and perhaps these are the best kinds of films, but unfortunately they are few and far between. As directed by Nicolas Roeg the visuals of the Australian outback are outstanding, as two children abandoned by their father, seek to get back to civilisation before they die of thirst. The young boy and girl encounter a young Aboriginal man whose help becomes indispensable to their survival. Aboriginal culture as represented by renowned actor David Gulpilil is portrayed as a harmonious representation of living within nature's means, whilst white civilisation is portrayed as giving nothing back in its efforts to progress away from so-called "savagery". John Barry's music is outstanding and I was also entranced by a number of experiments on the soundtrack in which the sound seemed on the face of it at least, to have little to do with what was going on visually. With the wonders of modern technology (ironically enough), I will soon be watching "Walkabout" again, in order to fully appreciate it's many moods and meanings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something new every time you watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film dozens of times, more or less since it first appeared on TV in the mid 70s, and each time see more in it - perhaps a reflection that, as I the viewer get older, I understand more of what is being suggested.You start with the nature (an it is glorious), and then the political undercurrent, perhaps the unspoken sexual imagery, the communication failure, the cultural misunderstandings, the wisdom of the white boy (younger and more open to new ideas), and so on. Many other reviewers have commented on the same.One thing that I notice on my latest viewing. Compare the images of the waterhole halfway through, with the images at the end, when The Girl "remembers" them. They are different - very different. The Girl swims alone in the former, but at the end she is with her brother and the aboriginal boy. They communicate and smile with each other - which almost never happens in the main film where The Girl in particular barely attempts to get to know her guide and saviour. And then the quotation.Is the director also saying here that these memories - that maybe all memory - is idealised? That Nostalgia - what we "remember" - is what we want to, even if - in truth - it never happened that way? That The Girl is wanting to return to a past - the Land of Lost Content - that never actually was?As I say, its a beautiful, wonderful film that would be impossible to make today for half a hundred reasons - and a film that can be watched a dozen times, and still appear fresh. Both simple, and complex with layer upon layer. A masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "Walkabout", some people may wonder what the point of it all is. This story of an English girl (Jenny Agutter) and her younger brother (Luc Roeg, director Nicolas Roeg's son) getting stranded in the Outback and befriending a young Aborigine (David Gulpilil) on his walkabout - a rite of passage for the Aborigines - could to some seem to be the sort of movie that they made just for fun.But I don't think that that's the case; only we Americans make movies "for fun". One thing is that the movie appears to be making the case that Australia is exotic - and they do just that. But there's something that appears frequently in Aussie flicks: communication issues. In this case, the Girl can't figure out how to communicate with the Aborigine, but her brother can, even though he doesn't speak the Aborigine's language.Anyway, this movie is a treat just for the scenery, if nothing else (although there's much else). It's quite impressive in every respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tremendous piece of filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw WALKABOUT at an impressionable age and it has stayed with me ever since, not least for its haunting scenes of animal killing and desolation in the Australian outback. WALKABOUT, Nicolas Roeg's masterful exploration of Australia and the people who inhabit it, is one of the most visually stunning films ever made.Roeg brings the harshness of the environment to life in a series of devastating shots that reveal the true heart of the country. His is a world of scorched deserts littered with the corpses of hunted creatures and inhabited by only the brave or foolhardy. In many ways, this is a horror film, bookended by gruesome death and yet containing some moments of pure joy within.The plot is simple: a schoolgirl and her younger brother are lost in the Outback and forced to fend for themselves in a hostile environment. Along the way, they meet up with an Aborigine (played by David Gulpilil, giving a truly great performance of real depth) and the rest of the film chronicles their adventures.Roeg uses this as a basis to explore numerous themes, from the plight of the oppressed indigenous peoples to the contrast between civilisation and the wilderness (to give you a clue, one is utterly condemned and the other fully embraced). Agutter plays a prim and proper, slightly irritating character but Lucien John is excellent as the boy and as previously mentioned, Gulpilil steals every scene he's in.WALKABOUT is one of my favourite films and a real visual experience that transcends cinematic boundaries to become a work of pure art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Casts a Long Shadow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This visually stunning 1971 movie anticipates many of today's main social and environmental topics.At its core, Walkabout is about cultural dominance: the capacity of European culture to dominate both nature and other peoples. Central to this dominance - as the film indicates - are discipline (the girl's fortitude in confronting the outback), conformity to rules (her rote recitation and dress code), hierarchy (unquestioned obedience, even to a deranged father), subjugation of nature (wild animal slaughter), private property (the station in the outback, the despoiled mine), white privilege (the aborigine is useful and nothing more), but most of all, dominance requires replacement of instinct with institutions and nature with technology. Older viewers will recognize counter-cultural themes of the 1960's. Nicholas Roeg has organized these ideas in interesting ways that keep eyes glued to the screen. However, there is a real need to pay attention to the visual imagery which in Walkabout amounts to a dominant text, with the rather sparse dialog acting as a subtext. Or put another way, in Walkabout Roeg is making a movie, not writing a play. Thus the opening sequence of imagery indicates reasons for the father's derangement and suicide, while crotch shots of the tree indicate the mating potential of boy and girl, a tension that is otherwise hard to convey since the aborigine boy speaks no English.Roeg's wise refusal to sentimentalize his characters gives the movie much of its strength. Instead, the main characters are treated in straightforward, non-judgmental fashion. Nevertheless, as other reviewers point out, the movie does make a statement. Namely, that the girl comes to regret her return to 'civilization', failing to realize at the time the natural paradise she had found on her walkabout. This rejection amounts to a telling commentary on the price the dominant culture has exacted from us in its demand for well-ordered 'progress'. While I agree with the spirit of the point, I think Roeg has idealized the contrast. After all, swimming, fishing, and roaming, look good from the standpoint of the closeted office in the big city. Yet millions of rural people to whom such simple pleasures are in some semblance available, leave those surroundings for the excitement only a big city can provide. In that sense, the girl's regret at movie's end can be taken as a coming to terms with the problems of modern European culture, rather than a return-to-nature as their oversimplified solution. Anyway, however you might choose to cut it, the movie is certainly worth a look see.</fullReview>

You can take each scene and event as that or see the entire film as one great artistic and philosophical allegory.It is pleasing on so many levels, yet incomprehensible on so many others. Could it all be a dream or someones recollection of a life. Could it be just one life or all of humanity, to include Nature her self?In fact it is moving and yet confusing.

		<fullReview>I caught this on TV recently, and was struck by how different it was from my expectations. I had thought that it would be an adventure story, which it was, but with a feeling that was closer to some of Peter Weir's films than to a normal desert survival story. The opening sequence, in particular, is quite odd. SPOILER: A schoolgirl and her younger brother are taken to the desert by their father. He seems completely ordinary, a bit stuffy, but then he starts shooting at his children and ultimately shoots himself in the head. No explanation is given for this: it simply happens, out of the blue, and sets the story in motion. For the rest of the movie, the sister and brother make their way across the desert and eventually are helped back to their home by an aborigine. The movie was directed by Nicolas Roeg, which explains the strange violent elements, but there is also a delicacy here in the desert images that is very different from anything in films like The Man Who Fell to Earth or Performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thinkabout...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Nic Roeg's without always claiming to fully understand every nuance of his films. The closest I think I got to him was in the thriller "Don't Look Now" which, despite employing his trademark juxtapositions, followed a more defined narrative to a definite conclusion, but there's enough in "Walkabout" to keep you constantly interested, even if often confused. Leave 'em thinking is Roeg's dictum.The movie starts memorably with the apparently unexplained violent suicide of an Australian-based English businessman unaccountably taking his children into the outback, ostensibly for a picnic, but in fact to murder them and commit a traces-covering flaming suicide. This shocking and unaccountable action is explained with a tiny bit of exposition near the end, but the movie is more about his teenage daughter and pre-teen son's escape and journey back to civilisation and encounter with a young Aborigine boy on "walkabout". The main point appears to be are they heading back to civilisation or away from it in the wild.Many people, probably with intellects and perceptions exceeding mine have already posted here on Roeg's themes here. I would certainly number amongst them the clash between civilisation and primitivism, the loss of innocence, a young girl's sexual awareness (personified in Jenny Agutter's journey to experience, partly responding to the different strains of nature bursting out all around her and brought to a head in the person of the young Aborigine, whose thwarted fertility dance to her only frightens her and leads him to the film's second shocking suicide) and as someone adroitly put it, a wonderful travelogue of the Australian outback, which we get to see in all its wild, strange beauty at different times and from a host of different perspectives.The acting by the three children is remarkable. Although almost none of their actions or dialogue are in any way natural, somehow they convince you that this is actually happening to them. It's a remarkably physical performance by David Gulpilil as the young Aborigine as he hunts the native wildlife for food, the squeamish should be advised that there's a lot of animal butchery here and it's obvious that a lot of animals were harmed in the making of this movie! And yet even this contributes to another of the film's themes, the survival of the fittest and the natural order of things. Yes there are many obscure-seeming scenes inter-cut into the narrative, like the weather-research party's lust for the only female member of their party or the group of Aborigines swarming over the burned-out car at the original death scene and yet they make a sort of sense in retrospect. Unquestionable of course is Roeg's cinematography, with shots from every conceivable vantage point, keeping the viewer's eye alert at all times. Sure there are longueurs at times but this is a film less about story than images and on that score it certainly succeeds.There are an abundance of ideas at work here and as I stated earlier I'm not sure I got all of them, but the fact that I'm still thinking of them says a lot for Roeg's skill. An art-house movie for sure, but what's wrong with that? Roeg never deliberately sought a big box-office "hit" and that's a credit to his singular artistic vision. Memorably eulogised in Mick Jones' excellent "E=MC2", Roeg has his admirers and I certainly count myself amongst them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tale of wilderness survival is essential viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Walkabout" is an often disorienting experience that offers the audience a bare amount of exposition. There is a violent unsettling act early in the story of wilderness survival that sets the story in motion, but is never explained. The question of why is important, but not knowing the answer is just as necessary and in not providing an answer director Nicolas Roeg is stretching our brain muscles and removing the safety netting. We start the movie disoriented, lost and this is a deliberate choice by its creator. "Walkabout" is a dangerous movie about seemingly irrational acts of violence and the violent and rational cycle of life played out in nature. It's also about man's uneasy relationship with the frequently violent natural world and how this relationship defines us.Nicolas Roeg is a master craftsman who in this film is more comfortable conveying meaning through montage than filmed conversation. "Walkabout" opens with a dialogue-free tour of modern-day (circa 1960s) industrial Australia. Machines click clack, cars honk, and butchers slice with cold mechanical precision. Even the film's lead (played by Jenny Agutter and referred to as Girl in the credits) is trapped in a mechanical role as she and her classmates steadily drone and sputter in a classroom voice exercise. The modern world is cold, angular, gray, impersonal. Contrast the cold grays of urban Australia with the brilliant rust-colored sands of the film's wild outback setting. These are two vastly different worlds and successfully moving from one to another proves impossible for everyone in the movie.The film's simple story finds actress Jenny Agutter and the director's young son Luc Roeg abandoned in the Australian outback and details their attempt to survive. During their journey they meet a helpful Aboriginal teenager on his walkabout, a rite of passage where a young man is left to the wilderness to survive on his own. A nagging question tugs at us throughout the film as we wonder if the Aboriginal teen is irreparably harming his quest as he becomes more involved in the lives of the two city dwellers. As the trio wanders through the wilderness, the children, who arrived in the outback in formal school uniforms, slowly shed their outfits as they begin to adapt to the natural world.As mentioned, "Walkabout" is a story about violence and Roeg's film is filled with much violent efficiency as insects strip down carrion, rust reclaims abandoned mining outposts, men slaughter wildlife for sustenance and sport, and the native peoples of the outback pick over a burnt and abandoned automobile. Those who would claim "Walkabout" is a simplistic fable about returning to nature and living simply neglect how unforgiving the outback is in the film. It readily consumes anything that stands still. Life in the wilderness is short and brutal, but Roeg does seem to be saying that the trappings of modern life are noise that distracts us from our finite nature and inevitability that the land will one day reclaim us for its own.The existence of the British interlopers is simplified as they focus on the essential concerns of finding food, water, and shelter. In an existence stripped down to essential needs, a sexual longing quickly develops between the Aboriginal teen and the girl he is shepherding through the wilderness. Roeg's treatment of this inevitability is frank, insistent, and sure to make many viewers ill at ease although it never seems forced or unnatural. This is a film about being guided by essential needs when removed from the concerns of modern existence. Roeg's frank examination of sexuality is more anthropological than titillating.The film is finally beautifully elliptical. "Walkabout" is about cycles--renewal, destruction, repeat. The film is bookended by unsettling deaths the causes of which the movie does not explain, but which can be readily discerned by the attentive viewer. "Walkabout" works on a basic emotional level while viewing it, but then expands in significance after the film is turned off and reflected upon. "Walkabout" may be a hard film to love as it is deliberately disorienting and holds that life is brutal and short. But it is a film that is hard to not to appreciate as one peels back its layers after viewing. Most multiplex bon bons quickly pass from memory once we have stepped outside the theater, but "Walkabout" plants itself firmly in the brain and lives on long after the movie has ended.A great work of art and essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the Outback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Mad Max and Crocodile Dundee, Australia's Outback received little cinematic attention apart from this film. The scenery is evocatively photographed and the unforgiving harshness of the land is on full display as two English kids in rather impractical school uniforms try to make their across its dry and empty vastness. An aboriginal teen befriends them and shows them how to get water and how Australia's odd creatures are not just curiosities - they're food! The story plays out, however, as the story of English-Aborigine relations in microcosm: the older child (Jenny Agutter) insists on speaking only English, and takes advantage of the Aborigine's knowledge and skills while treating him as an inferior, almost a servant, and putting her own comfort ahead of everything. The drama plays out to a suitably tragic conclusion, as any story about British Colonial attitudes clashing with locals might be expected to do. Beautiful to look at and think about, this is a rare and special movie experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating Dream-Like Fable Of Lost Children In The Australian Outback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When their father goes crazy and tries to kill them, a teenage girl and her young brother get lost in the Australian Outback. They are befriended by an Aborigine boy who is on a walkabout, his quest for adulthood in the wilds of nature. Can they get back home ?This is probably my favourite of Roeg's many fine films (a toss-up with The Witches) and like so much of his work is visually dazzling, thematically fascinating and a completely unique movie. The story is so sparse as to be almost non-existent; what matters is the landscape and the unusual relationships between the white kids and the native, who can't speak each other's languages and don't understand each other's cultures. Although they are separated by these immense barriers, they become friends through the simplest and most basic requirements of life; food, shelter, leisure, purpose. The film alternately shows their happiness together and reinforces the differences of their backgrounds - all the white people we encounter are either living meaningless rat race lives, exploiting others or killing animals for no reason. Like a few other films (Badlands, Southern Comfort, much of Werner Herzog's work), the setting is really the fourth character in the movie, full of amazing vistas of sand, rocky canyons and lush groves filled with plants and animals - echidnas, cockatoos, wallabies, scorpions, frill-necked lizards, a wombat which snuffles at the children while they are sleeping. The landscapes are hypnotic and dazzling, giving the movie an unreal, dreamy quality which somehow makes is seem more naturalistic, almost a documentary. The three actors - although what they're doing almost transcends acting - are all terrific; Agutter is hauntingly beautiful, perhaps the best representation of repressed sexual awakening in cinema, whilst Gulpilil is charismatic and iconic (and is in several other great films). Whilst credited as Lucien John, the boy is really Roeg's son, and oddly it's him who really bridges the characters and holds the story together - in what other big studio movie does one eight-year-old boy speak two-thirds of the dialogue ? Featuring a rich John Barry score, this is extremely well directed and photographed by Roeg (his first solo effort) - a rich, moving and beautiful film. Based on a book by James Vance Marshall and shot in amazing locations all over the magical land of Oz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tragedy that has withstood the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few things about this Nicolas Roeg film that date it as having been made over a quarter of a century ago. Could there be a more dramatic clash of cultures than two young urban Australians being stranded in the outback and meeting up with an aborigine? The aborigine is on a "walkabout" (which is presented here as a rite of passage whereby an aborigine lives by his wits for an extended period in the outback). The young city dwellers are a young boy (Luc Roeg) and his sister (Jenny Agutter); how they wind up being stranded in the outback is one of the unforgettable surprises in the movie. None of the characters is ever given a name which elevates the story beyond the particular.The boy is around ten years old and his sister is a young teenager; the aborigine (David Gulpilil) is about the same age as the girl. How these three interact forms the core of the movie. The boy is young enough that he has a more flexible world view than his sister. He is ultimately able to establish a crude form of communication with the aborigine and has a more accepting and natural relationship with him. Even at her young age the girl as been acculturated to the extent that she cannot get beyond the strictures of her upbringing. She worries about her school uniform and getting back to her society, whereas the boy is young enough that he could almost flip and join the aborigine. The film makes you think about just how shaped by your society you are.Gulpilil ennobles this film. His relationship with his new companions is deeply felt. He becomes their protector and is prideful in his hunting abilities that allow him to be such. He has a graceful athleticism that is a joy to watch, particularly in his prolonged courtship dance. As the result of people from two different cultures being unable to bridge the divide between them there is a tragic ending.In addition to an absorbing story we get a travelogue and nature picture. Director Roeg is an artistic cinematographer/photographer in addition to his skill as a director. He shows us much beauty in the landscape--many of the movie's frames could be blown up and mounted as photographs. We also are treated to a variety of wildlife photography that could serve as a segment on the Nature Channel.The only downside for me was the sappy Musak score played during the idealistic scenes. This is puzzling since the rest of the score is inventive and quite effective.The ending, with the girl back in her native society and married to a businessman, packs a final punch. As her husband is excitedly talking about his potential advancement in his company the girl is reflecting on a particularly idealistic moment in her travels with the aborigine. Has she come to realize and appreciate more fully what was happening between her and the aborigine? Is the emptiness she feels in listening to her husband prattle on provoking a longing for a simpler more meaningful life or, as implied by the final quote from a Housman poem, just a pleasant memory made poignant by the realization that that pleasure can never be repeated?We are left with much to ponder about cultural barriers and potential unfortunate consequences of resultant misunderstandings. This is a relevant message for a world that is becoming more globally interconnected.The pressures of living in a complex modern society versus the rewards of a more self-reliant primitive existence are starkly contrasted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never heard of the director Nicholas Reog until this film and I remember seeing it a long, long time ago on the ABC in its full uncut form. I only just got this on DVD last year and have only watched it twice since then. I find it an interesting experience. The director seems to have some kind of fascination with Ms. Agutter and while I can't blame him I have to wonder if some of the scenes they did with her are really THAT important to the film. The scenes I am thinking of are the nude swimming at the end of the film, though that is part of her remembering her time in the desert at the end of the film.There are a few animal killings in the film as we see the girl and her younger brother met by a local Aborigine played by David Gulpilil and through the film we see his reaction to this girl as she and the boy travel with him, and his later suicide as she is ignorant of his sexual desire for her.I'll probably have to watch this film again in full without interruption to get the full impact of it. One scene that did bug me was the one with the weather balloon. It looked out of place with the rest of the movie and I still wonder to this day why it's even in there. It serves IMHO no purpose.That notwithstanding I did give the film 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An introduction to two view points on life in Australia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many visitors to Australia are surprised to find large cities here. They imagined it was all bushland with kangaroos and koalas and aborigines playing their didgeridoos. This film relates how two city children find themselves lost in the great outback where they learn about the aborigines and important aspects of survival..The film makers insist on showing us the contrasts between the cities and the bush. We see a woman cutting up meat in her kitchen and then an aborigine throwing a kangaroo leg on an open fire, we see walls of brick and mortar and high rise buildings and then a massive outcrop of red rocks pushing up towards the sky, we hear the honking of horns and clatter of traffic and then the call of birds wheeling across the empty plains.The two children a girl ( Jenny Agutter ) and a boy (Luc Roeg) are a delight. Decked out in their College uniforms, they make a strange pair in this harsh landscape as they desperately seek water and hopefully a guiding hand to help them on their way. The film makers keep reminding us that we are in Australia as they inter cut with shots of lizards and other crawling animals.The third and perhaps most important member of the cast is Gulpilil a young aboriginal boy who speaks no English. He springs about like an animal and is adept at spearing kangaroos and fish. He befriends the children and feeds them thus saving their lives. Later in the story the children seek help from a white man who for some reason is very annoyed at their presence and completely shuns them. I just could not believe that scene. The people of the bush are the friendliest people on earth and will always give a hand.There are a few nude scenes in the film where the three children refresh themselves in natural pools. Tastefully filmed and with no sexual implications, the camera work captures coloured reflections on the surface of the pool which is quite beautiful.If I were making this film I would delete the verse of poetry which is spoken at the end. It is not necessary. We enjoyed the film. We got the message. Let's leave it at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware of animal slaughter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've already watched the film, then you know what I'm referring to. If you haven't seen it yet, you might want to be prepared for some rather graphic hunting scenes. Some such scenes fit well with the main ideas - juxtaposing aboriginal life with "civilized" life. But a few such scenes are gratuitous (i.e. we've already seen the kangaroo speared and terrified - we don't need to see it clubbed repeatedly in the face - in closeup, no less). Fast forwarding is advised.I've noticed that the film has taken more flack for the nudity than for the animal killings, which makes some sense because the killings are (we assume) in accordance with aboriginal life, while the nudity is contrived by Roeg. However, it seemed to me that the nudity was essential to the point of the film; a civilized girl is immersed in primal, physical existence for this walkabout episode in her life. I also felt that the camera was more discreet than voyeuristic; i.e. nearly ever shot is distant, not closeup.MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD. The film deliberately leaves itself open to interpretation. I did not see it as white/civilized/bad versus aboriginal/primal/good. I felt the point was to demonstrate parallels between the two, to show us that we are not so different as we thought. We see, or overhear conversations about, the civilized folks hunting or preparing animals for food. Then we see the aborigine hunting for food. We see the civilized people flirting and sneaking glances at each other. We see the White Girl and Black Boy doing the same. Note also the closing freezed-frame image: phallic, obviously, but also an image of parallels or pairs, suggesting connections rather than separation.At any rate, it's not a masterpiece on par with Roeg's "Don't Look Now" or "Man Who Fell To Earth" but it's certainly an engaging and memorable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best unintentional travelogue.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting Nicholas Roeg film that sort of invites conversation, as the film piles metaphors upon double meanings, upon foreshadowing etc. The story is simple, when a brother and sister find themselves stranded in the Outback of Austtralia, they find leadership, and maybe more, from a bushman who is doing a walkabout to prove his manhood.As I said, this film has a whole pile of double meanings, and the film sort of grips you from the start with it's Koyaanisiqatsi like urban-images (of course, that film didn't come out til much later) and then suddenly we're transported into the desert to meet our 2 characters, who's Dad, shall we say, makes a very curious decision. Anyways, the 2 characters are then lifted off into the desert. And what a desert it is! I'm not too sure what kind of research Roeg did for this film, but you feel you're in some sort of mind-warping travelogue here, with visions of animals, the climate and the weather of the outback.Simply stunning.I'm not going to say much about the story, but there's a whole lot of interesting foreshadowing going on, especially with the father character. Although if you foreshadow to much into it, eg, Love = Death, you start wondering if that was the intention of the film. Again, this is a nice movie that will make you THINK.The cast here is remarkable, Jenny Agutter shows what a real amazing actress she turned out to be (She was in American Werewolf In London and Saturn's Run among other things) and her brother is played by the director's own son, Lucien, who shows a natural youth curiosity of the things around him, and his performance hardly see,s forced at all.Now, much has been said about the rampant nudity and violence (which aren't connected) in the film. And while much of it makes some sense in connection to the story (eg, it's organic) I wouldn't go as far as one critic suggesting to take your whole family to it.</fullReview>

Particularly to those who found it to be a "hippie" or "anti-technology" lecture. When the girl is grown at the end she "remembers" swimming nude with the Boy and the Aborigine as wistful poetry emphasizes her longing for this innocent state. But that innocent scene NEVER TOOK PLACE. She swam nude, but alone, and would not have tolerated an intrusion from the Aborigine. The idyllic state she longs for is not a memory, but a fantasy. I think this detail brings a deeper level of complexity to this emotional movie, despite or because of its minimalism in terms of script and dialogue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a mess. I loved this movie at times, and because of that, I also came to hate it in the end. Imagine if Kubrick's 2001 had been re-edited by George Lucas and you'll get an idea of what a messy director Nicolas Roeg is. I first heard of this movie when I saw it under Roger Ebert's great movies list. I started watching this, and for a good part of it, I thought I was watching a masterpiece. In the way that it perfectly mixed images and music, and made interesting use of camera angles, and didn't follow an obvious plot, reminded me of 2001, and I thought maybe it would be just as good. Roeg's cinematography of the sand and the sun, as well as John Barry's great music definitely deserve to be noted. Many scenes in it are beautiful and interesting. In particular, the opening scenes of Adelaide, with the dijeridoo music, the swim scene, the sunset, and the very sad tragic mating dance scene. I was a little confused by the way the father shot at the kids, and the kids dont say anything, but that was sort of settled when they talk about it later, so that was OK. But then the movie sort of begins to commit cinematic suicide. In the second half of the movie, the flow is definitely interrupted by scenes that have nothing to do with the characters we've been following. Like when suddenly, the aboriginie sees one white person, then there are a bunch of white people who are forcing aboriginies to work for them. And the montage of animals getting shot. But that was only a little distracting, it wasn't so bad, it just seemed to be trying a little too hard to communicate the message that Australians are hurting the environment and the Aboriginies. I already got to like the environment and Aboriginies just from watching them in the movie. Those obvious scenes sort of killed the point that was already made quite well, and more subtlely. But anyway, those aren't the worst issues. Here's what kills the film. In the end, we see the girl in her apartment, and after a whole film of being dressed messily, she is now in lots of makeup, looking very civilized. Her boyfriend comes in and starts saying something about his monetary situation. The girl is gazing off. She flashes back to the swim in the desert. The John Barry music starts. Not a bad ending, I thought; I was about to forgive the film. But then, out of nowhere, comes a narrator, who we have never heard before, reading a poem!!! That was the last straw. The movie just overdid it. It has good ideas in it, but then it tries to make them too clear and obvious, and in the process, makes them seem almost stupid. THE NARRATOR APPEARS OUT OF NOWHERE AND READS A POEM!!!! I just can't get over that.</fullReview>

Ms.Agutter's natural charms are showcased here rather better than in any of her subsequent films I have seen. My younger friends of the '90s would describe her as a "total fox" in this movie. The photography is spectacular, the basic plot fairly simple, but the undercurrents and symbolism are a challenge at first viewing. The ending is sad, but perhaps predictable.

		<fullReview>The film to me signified loss, the loss of innocence, freedom and magic at the heart of the life of children. The film is truly beautiful and contrasts between the cold concrete world of adults and Western society against the natural world and spontaneity of the life of children. Housmans Poem "into my heart an air that chills from far yon country blows" offers an insight into that lost world, the door may sometimes seem ajar but it is truly shut. The scene where Agutter's mind wanders off as her husband talks to her in their flat and we see her mind's eye remembering her time in the outback with her Auborigine rescuer and her younger brother are truly heartbreaking as she realises that she can never return to the land of lost content the happy highways where she went but cannot come again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story but badly told.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked Walkabout a lot, but, having said that, I also think the film is full of flaws. To understand what was happening, I found myself making a great deal of assumptions.Warning - Spoilers follow:Ok, obviously the father went crazy, tried to kill his children, failed, then torched his car and put a bullet in his own head. Perhaps beginning the film so abruptly is good because it startles the audience, but why not spend a few more minutes setting up whatever problem the father had along with why he and the kids were in the middle of the outback dressed the way they were with such an outlandish picnic lunch. A little more information from the director would have helped.If the director had a voyeuristic thing going with Jenny Agutter, why not try to at least hide that a bit. I thought the constant upskirt camera angle and panties shots a bit much and although Jenny Agutter's nude scenes were seriously sweet, they added nothing to the film. Perhaps they added something to the director's experience. Plus, adding the nude swimming scene with the girl, her brother, and the aboriginal boy at the end of the film, when it wasn't shown earlier, seemed out of place and explained nothing.Why were we introduced to the weather people? Did we have to meet them so we would understand what a weather balloon was when the kids found it later?I assume the aboriginal boy was doing a courting dance of some kind and when it failed because the girl had no idea what he was doing or why, that's why the kid hung himself in a tree. Unfortunately, I didn't pick up on the fact the boy was at all interested in her from the movie.I thought the rather abrupt end of their walkabout experience was out of place, too. They finally make it to a mostly abandoned mining town, meet a rather strange guy, and then end up hanging around the abandoned mining equipment.....then we jump right to the epilogue?Is it just me or did alot of this film end up on the cutting room floor? I can't believe someone would direct a movie this way on purpose.Were all the Animal Planet shots really necessary? It gave me the impression Australia is swarming with critters.I liked the story. I just wish someone else had told it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did they not stick to the book?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film was beautifully photographed, I found the storyline irritatingly pretentious especially as by deviating from the book, the story became confusing and full of huge loopholes. Why did they change the plane crash (which made sense) to the drive in the desert? This was the first blunder.To begin with, they took a drive, while wearing their school uniforms, with an elaborate picnic from Sydney (as identified by the bridge) to the central Australian desert, a good 2,000 miles away, in a little Volkswagen Beetle with no air conditioning and not a speck of Australia's ubiquitous red dust on the car or them. Then inexplicably, the father tries to shoot the children who don't seem very bothered, as though this happens every other day, perhaps when daddy has had a drop too much to drink. Daddy doesn't try too hard and when the children scamper off he torches the car and shoots himself. The plane crash in the book was much more believable.The children then set off to walk home, not along the road which they would have driven on, no, that would have been too easy. Along the way they run into a young aboriginal youth, from the Northern Territory by the look of him, and this is where the story really picks up. The young man is doing his best to stay away from the white man, and takes the children with him on a long trek running close to, but just out of sight of "civilization" The children do not know that they are really quite close to rescue, and the boy does not tell them. Perhaps with the communications problem, he does not understand. The film reminded me many times of "The Emerald Forest" where the little boy disappeared into the jungle and was found by Indians who were silently watching the road being built only steps away from the heavy construction equipment, and yet so very far.This film is the best Australian wilderness film since "Jedda" a 1950s film about the attempts of a white couple to raise an aboriginal child in a white man's world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful image of a film but, like a poster, if you look behind nothing is there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roeg's first solo film as director ( the earlier 'Performance' was co-directed with Donald Cammell ), shows off to good effect what he learnt as a cinematographer. His concentration on this aspect though, causes big cracks to appear in other areas of the film which ultimately are serious enough to undermine all the cinematic beauty and force 'Walkabout' into the category of grand failure.Jenny Agutter plays a teenage schoolgirl who is left to fend for herself and her young brother when their father cracks up and kills himself after driving them out for a desert picnic. This allows for numerous striking images and wonderfully composed shots as the two urban, civilised, fair-skinned children walk through the beautiful savagery of the outback. We are treated to numerous close-ups of lizards which try and divert our attention from the dialogue which is minimal and often trite. The young boy ( played by Roeg's son ) seems to have ability but his role is severely hampered by sound problems which render many of his lines impossible to understand. Agutter's delivery is bland and her performance doesn't have the power to make her character work - her nude swim is by far her best scene which doesn't speak highly for the film as a whole. David Gulpilil takes all the acting plaudits as the Aborigine boy, but he isn't given enough support to function at a high level. In the second half of the film even the imagery starts to become laboured - particularly all the scenes of urban decay.The basic premise of the Westernised brother and sister finding their civilised education useless in the wilderness, having to rely on the primitive savagery of the Aborigine to survive, should have been a solid storyline - but there is too much pretension and everything is overcomplicated and laden with unnecessary symbolism and double meanings. This results in the film becoming boring and dull to sit through - one for the cultural snobs to debate over and delight in it's paper thin glossy coat which conceals a very fragile effort that won't stand up to any deep probings.Roeg's next film did manage to successfully fuse his talents into a fully-realised production and the results were excellent. 'Don't Look Now' proved to be the only shining star in a directorial career full of unfulfilled promise which, by the the mid-90's, was reduced to the occasional Made-for-TV movie.  </fullReview>

A beautiful film, that will stick in the memory for a long while after. It has to be mentioned how stunning Agutter looks in this film.

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Beautiful Looking Movies Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walkabout (1971) *** 1/2 (out of 4) A girl (Jenny Agutter) and her young brother (Luc Roeg) find themselves in the Australian outback trying to survive after being left out there. Soon they run across a hunter (David Gulpilil) who is out there on a "walkabout." Nicolas Roeg's WALKABOUT is without question one of the greatest looking films that you're ever going to see. I've often said that this film did for the outback what Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODDYSEY did for space. I mean, whenever you think of a dessert setting your mind can't help but go to the images on display throughout this poetic look at struggle.For my money the greatest thing done by Roeg is just the atmosphere and setting that he creates. There's not too much dialogue but what really moves the film is the beautiful music score and cinematography. The images that we view are breathtaking from the opening scenes to the closing ones. The stuff in the outback is beautifully captured and there's no doubt that the setting comes to life. The music score also perfectly captures the innocence and beauty of everything going on.The performance by the three leads are another major plus. Agutter rightfully became a name after this picture and it's easy to see why. The role here certainly isn't flashy but the actress is able to do so much with such little dialogue. Her eyes certainly tell you everything you need to know and there's a very intelligent performance. You can see her intelligence without her saying a word. Both Roeg and Gulpili are equally as great in their supporting roles.WALKABOUT is certainly a very poetic film that has some of the greatest images that you're ever going to see. It's really a film full of life and the way it plays out holds your attention from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has just appeared on the BBC Iplayer. For its age I thought it was quite good and stood the test of time quite well. It is however totally let down by the voyeuristic content, primarily, but not limited to, Jenny Agutter. She may have been 17 when filming this but why on earth does she wear such a short skirt, why does the director dwell on her legs so much much (i started to get concerned when there was the view of her getting the picnic out of the car) - she is presumably playing a schoolgirl and these shots are totally inappropriate and add nothing to the film whatsoever. I get the swimming scene and what these add, but it too is far too long and the shots dwelling on her bottom are a total disgrace. It really made me feel quite concerned. I'm not a film buff and have joined IMDb today just to register my comments. Some of the nonsense on these posts supporting the film in this regard are really quite deluded.The UK film board had an opportunity to ban this film and that was a missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delirious rumination o nature and sexuality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walkabout takes a premise that brims with condescending racism and Oscar-bait melodrama: a pair of white Australians are lost in the wilderness, but saved by a silent and resourceful Aboriginal, who teaches them the ways of nature and leads the young woman to a sexual awakening. It doesn't so much escape from these trappings as sweep them aside by making the whole narrative elliptical and bizarre, more reminiscent of a heat-drenched dream than a realist narrative.Roeg's visual gifts are the main attraction here, from the dissonantly- edited montages to the brutal close-ups of natural life. Walkabout is not a film that asks you to sit back and admire the beauty of a natural vista, but rather one that rubs your nose in the violent struggle for survival that is the wilderness. Jenny Agutter manages to wrench the viewer's attention away from the bizarre visuals, with both her beauty and her strangely detached air. David Guilpilil's Aborigine does certainly fall into the "noble savage" archetype, but there are some moments in the film which suggest that this too is an illusion.Walkabout is a film that at first seems instantly dated, but then suddenly becomes too strange to fit in comfortably with any time period or movement. For fans of experimental cinema, this is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two young children are stranded in the Australian outback and are forced to cope on their own. They meet an Aborigine on "walkabout": a ritualistic separation from his tribe.Louis Nowra wrote, "I was stunned. The images of the Outback were of an almost hallucinogenic intensity. Instead of the desert and bush being infused with a dull monotony, everything seemed acute, shrill, and incandescent. The Outback was beautiful and haunting." I could not agree more -- National Geographic cannot make a film more rich and vibrant than this.Roger Ebert asked rhetorically, "Is it a parable about noble savages and the crushed spirits of city dwellers? That's what the film's surface suggests, but I think it's about something deeper and more elusive: the mystery of communication." Is he on to something? I do not know... there is definitely a communication element -- its importance is debatable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Poignantly atmospheric and esoteric..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>English cinematographer and director Nicolas Roeg's second feature film which was written by English theatre director, poet, theorist, playwright and screenwriter Edward Bond, is loosely based on English author David Gordon Payne alias James Vance Marshall's book from 1959 and premiered In Competition at the 24th Cannes International Film festival in 1971. It was shot entirely on location in Sydney, Australia and is a UK production which was produced by Si Litvinoff. It tells the story about a father who one day goes on a picnic in the Australian wilderness with his two adolescent children. What the children thinks is going be a nice picnic, suddenly turns into a battle for survival when their father pulls out a gun and starts shooting at them. The schoolgirl grabs a hold of her younger brother and manages to hide them behind a rock, but after hearing that her father's car explodes and seeing that he shoots himself, she realizes that they are left to themselves. Intending to get back to Adelaide where they live, the two of them begins to walk into the wilderness and gets lost. The siblings are surrounded by crawling animals, worn-out by the heat and are becoming dehydrated, but suddenly they notice an aboriginal boy who is out on his walkabout coming towards them.Acutely and engagingly directed by British filmmaker Nicolas Roeg in the first film he directed on his own, this surreal and ethereal fictional tale draws an exceedingly mysterious portrayal of an abandoned brother and sister's eventful journey of discovery through the Australian wilderness and their encounter with a young aboriginal man. While notable for it's distinct and naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by Nicolas Roeg, fine editing by British film editor Antony Gibbs and use of sound, this character-driven and finely tuned adventure drama which was executively produced by American producer Max L. Raab (1925-2008) examines themes like coming-of-age, human relations and cultural differences and contains a great score by English composer John Barry (1933-2011). This sparse study of character which is set against the backdrop of the Australian outback and where two siblings are looking for a way to get back to their home, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent and fragmented narrative structure, substantial character development, minimal dialog and the unconventional acting performances by English television and film actress Jenny Agutter, producer and Nicolas Roeg's son Luc Roeg in his debut feature film role and Indigenous Australian actor and traditional dancer David Gulpilil in his debut feature film role. A poignantly atmospheric, memorable and esoteric independent film from the early period of the Australian New Wave in the early 1970s.</fullReview>

First of all it takes an audience with an attention span, so modern viewers shouldn't bother with this one. It has a slow pace but not as slow as 2001, but comparable. If 2001 was an outback film, it would look something like this, however Roeg uses far more cuts than Kubrick. Some graphic scenes involving animals. And, it's realism makes it feel as though you are watching a documentary or wildlife film...truly a spectacle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So near to being a masterpiece, and yet so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neither before nor since have so many great images been wrung out of the Australian landscape. It's an unattractive landscape and there is not, I would have thought, a lot that a cameraman can do with it; but each image is not only striking, but striking in a unique way.Not that the photography is faultless. Every so often Roeg seems to get carried away by his own craft, so we get pointless freeze-frames, distracting hand-held camera shake, and the like. And the SELECTION of images is often heavy-handed beyond belief. The shot of the aboriginal boy killing and dismembering the kangaroo is interleaved with shots of a Sydney butcher likewise cutting a kangaroo into bits - as if to indicate that blacks and whites share the common bond of cutting up animal carcasses. Well, duh. And this is far from being Roeg's most embarrassing conceit. The low point is probably the very end, where a narrator appears out of nowhere to tell us what a character is feeling when it could hardly have been more obvious - by reciting poetry.Still, if you can shoulder Roeg's artiness there's a lovely story about an English teenaged girl and an aboriginal teenaged boy. The English girl's brother tags along for the ride. He acts a source of dialogue in what would otherwise be an almost wordless film - in other words, he's a complete waste of space. Somehow the film loses momentum during the second half, and it's clear that SOMETHING is draining away energy fast. My theory is it's the boy. Roeg must also be blamed from straying from the point but he wouldn't have done so had the boy not been there. It's a pity, because all along I had a retinal image of a knock-down brilliant movie. The actual film comes so very close to matching the retinal image. Unfortunately the few differences prove fatal: `Walkabout' is simply a beautiful piece of cinema with a good premise, an arresting beginning, and a conclusion that WOULD have been moving had it not been preceded by so much tedium.</fullReview>

The Good: beautiful scenery, cerebral context, Jenny Agutter was pretty &amp; a decent actress as well as David Gulpilil, as the aboriginal boy; interesting adventure of kids lost in the Outback. The Bad: for those that don't like cerebral films, it moves slowly, taking in scenery and nature, often with long moments of silence or just musical score and the musical score leaves much to be desired; also, there are some scenes in the beginning and end that you have to ponder and aren't spelled out for you (I basically understood, but many reviewers were confused); The Ugly: the movie often shows the killing &amp; gutting of animals; it also splices in flashes of modern civilization, for example the aboriginal boy hacking up an animal he just caught, with flashes of a butcher chopping up meats (although I think I understand why the director did this, I felt that it was intrusive &amp; interrupted the flow); also, parents beware, there is a long nude scene of the girl swimming (Jenny, was playing a 16 years old in the film, but the actress was 18 years old), although it is tasteful, she is shown in full frontal nudity and is also shown naked a few other times in the film (Trivia: the actress was embarrassed during the nude swimming, so most of the crew had to leave while filming that scene, but later they all went skinny dipping together.) So, although it has some artistic quality, I didn't love it (or hate it.) I probably wouldn't recommend this film, because it will only appeal to a certain group of movie watchers...a 5/10 (middle of the road) in My Humble Opinion! 2014</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, but I have some problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A teenage British girl (Jenny Agutter) and her little brother are taken deep into the Australian Outback by their father for a good, old-fashioned murder-suicide. When the kids get away, the father goes ahead with his own death, figuring they'll probably die in the desert. They last by themselves long enough, but soon an Aboriginal teenager comes upon them and helps them survive. The film is more a collection of images and impressions than a narrative. Roeg likes to compare the savagery of nature with that of civilization. The big problem with the film is that a sexual tension develops between the Aboriginal boy and the white girl. That's actually the main thrust (excuse the pun) of the latter half of the film. Honestly, though I'm sure Roeg was being daring for his time, the conceit in itself is pretty racist. The story is basically one of interracial lust, with the white woman interested but unwilling and the black man super-horny for white meat. Really, Aboriginal women do appear in the film, and I would assume that that culture's standard of beauty must be extremely different from our own. And it's funny when the Aboriginal boy, to attract Agutter, does a goofy mating dance to attract her. Perhaps that is how they do it, but to me this little bit animalized the boy to a nasty degree. I should also say that the little white boy, played by Roeg's son Luc, is one of those painful little brats who chatters on endlessly. My thoughts at the beginning, when the father was taking pot shots at him, was that this murder-suicide was entirely justifiable on account of his son's annoyingness. Really, the boy is only there through the rest of the film so the black boy can't bone the white girl. Okay, I have a couple of seemingly major criticisms of the film. Honestly, I enjoyed Walkabout quite a bit. While it's racist attitudes toward sex might be offensive, hell, it is a genuinely erotic film. And it's simply beautiful. Its images are haunting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simplistic, pretentious and dishonest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie reminded me why I so passionately dislike Nicolas Roeg. Though Walkabout is thankfully free of naked rock-stars (no Jagger, Bowie or Garfunkel), all his other kinks (jerky editing and obtrusive photographic effects) are fully in place and, as usual, hinder rather than improve the movie. The story of two kids lost in the Australian Outback hooking up with a young aboriginal boy would be interesting enough if told honestly and directly, but unfortunately Roeg doesn't seem to know the meaning of those words. No, Mr. Visionary Director had to contrast the oh-so-pure aboriginal culture with the unredeemingly evil modern society, sketched in the most simplistic and caricatural way. Is there anything more obvious than cross-cutting between the native way of hunting and two white hunters shooting at buffalo from a pick-up truck? Is there anything more cringe-inducing than representing the re-entry into Western civilization of the two white kids by a montage of brick walls? This is first-year-of-filmschool symbolism! And yet, somehow this movie is still highly regarded by some critics.Make a movie in which all aboriginals are mean and nasty and you'll rightly be considered a racist. Make a movie in which all white people are mean and nasty and suddenly you're an enlightened filmmaker. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great wildlife; unlikely plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the beginning with the choice of a picnic site in the middle of an arid plain followed by a suicide and a burning auto, there were many unbelievable occurrences in this film, which seems to have some sort of "classic" status. The two "children" (Agutter is a beautiful young woman) pick up their belongings and trudge off into the outback, without showing any particular distress over these horrific events. One wonders how in the world these young people manage to emerge from their wilderness adventure with school uniforms still fresh . Such things bother this reviewer. Also what was the point of having the bit about the scientific expedition with the one beautiful woman being ogled by the men? The picture's thesis about corrupt civilization and the superiority of the natural man has been already stated. I found many similarly gratuitous elements in Walkabout (1971), but the photography and the wildlife were great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated and tedious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this when it was originally released. The fact that I recall nothing beyond Jenny Agutter sportingly going naked beyond the 1971 norms should have been warning enough. I just rewatched, having seen a recent documentary about the wonders of Nicholas Roeg's auteur skills.Well, the cinematography is occasionally striking, but it's mostly routine, and the film is frequently intercut with irrelevant wildlife closeups that would have been rejected from any David Attenborough documentary, even in 1971. The acting, from all three principals, is unremarkable (to put it very kindly).The story (is there one?) is ridiculous. The father of two young kids dramatically tops himself (and torches his car) in front of his offspring. (In real life, parents who commit suicide with their children around usually take the children with them.) Then the kids, to show just how gormless they must be, wander off into the Australian hinterland instead of simply following their car's tyre tracks back to civilisation.I think we're supposed to be gripped with watching the burgeoning of young sexuality; personally I find Jenny Agutter's splendid legs the only attractive thing to watch.After an hour of this flat, dull, pointless film, one wants to switch off, but remains glued to see if something remotely interesting is going to happen and wipe all the negative feelings the tedium has generated. Spoiler: nothing does happen. The whole thing is strongly reminiscent of those boring, pretentious French films that had pseudointellectuals raving in the 1960s and 70s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A random walk in the desert.That's pretty much what this movie is. Starts randomly, continues randomly, ends randomly. The start was so implausible - clearly just a plot device to get the kids lost in the desert - that you have forewarning that this is not going to be a great movie.From then it's just random occurrences, some of which never get linked to the main plot. (Eg I still haven't figured out what the horny scientists and their balloons had to do with anything).I could have liked this even if it turned out to be what I suspected it was going to be: am overly politically correct essay on the clash of cultures between whites and native Australians. But, while it shaped up to be that one stage, that theme pretty quickly disappeared. However, we did have the director's massive overuse of jarring match cuts just to keep remind you about it, without progressing the discussion or actually saying anything constructive about it.Similarly, the director had a secondary urban vs rural sub-theme going through the movie, all through jerky back-and-forth match cuts. Yeah, yeah, we get it, and got it early, so no need to keep reminding us: city bad, country good, whites bad, natives good.Nope, the main plot is pretty much a random one. Kids stranded in desert, wander around, random things occur, meet native boy, wander around, random things occur.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did you ever someone who is intelligent and well-spoken but who just won't stop talking. And the more he talks the less sense he makes, and yet he speaks so eloquently and with such style that you feel compelled to listen, even though the headache growing in your brain screams at you to run away. That's a lot like Nicolas Roeg's films. And that's a lot like "Walkabout". Beautifully shot, very stylish, and yet so...soooo vague. One vague scene drifting into another. One ponderous moment oozing into the next. As it just goes on and on and on...and the buzzing in your head gets louder and louder. I've encountered this with Roeg's films before, to greater and lesser degrees. I am aware of the beauty of what's on the screen and of Roeg's talent, but I can't get past this feeling that he doesn't really want to make a film that's about anything. And the ponderousness of the stories becomes oppressive. "Walkabout" is supposedly a classic. I admit it has very good cinematography. And Jenny Agutter is lovely, but beyond that I don't see a lot else. The whole nature vs. technology metaphor is so pounded into the viewer's skull you want to scream "all right!! I get it!! I get it!!" And Roeg is the king of mixed signals (not in a good way, either), as in one scene we get shot after shot of the aborigine teen slaying animals intercut with full frontal nude shots of sixteen-year old Jenny swimming around while muzak plays (???) That nonsense of showing beauty/slaughter intercut was old by 1969, so Roeg was not doing anything new. Honestly, I would avoid this movie. It's just frustrating. If you want to watch something good, check out some of the films of Donald Cammell (who co-directed "Performance" with Roeg), he is less well-known, but was a far superior director.</fullReview>

The precipitating incident, in which a father takes his children to the desert and tries unsuccessfully to kill them, makes no sense as there is no attempt to give it motivation. The resulting trek through the bush likewise seems to serve no point other than as an excuse for showing extended shots of Jenny Agutter swimming naked. There is no real plot, no character development, no psychological point, just a series of images and lots of long, boring silences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers!After hearing so many good things about this movie, and also finding out that just about every review I could find on it gave it glowing remarks, I anticipated seeing the director's cut of this movie on DVD.I mean, what wasn't to like? Jenny Agutter (sic), a beautiful actress also from Logan's Run &amp; American Werewolf in London... David Gulpilil who you can see in the US in Rabbit-Proof Fence.Unfortunately I came away very disappointed. Part of me could not appreciate the style that Roeg filmed it. It's one of those movies that you hear was groundbreaking at the time, but watching it 30 years later, you feel it just didn't age well.I'll give it this.. the stars of the movie did a fine job, and as I read once, it was almost like they were not acting..However...Watching the movie, there are many many many many cuts away from the primaries, to see closeups of ants, slugs, bees, snakes, lizards, scorpions, etc.. etc.. etc.. After the 40th time, I actually said out loud "Okay.. I GET IT! THEY ARE IN THE OUTBACK!!" As if all the sand, dirt and isolation DIDNT already give that away.What I found most odd was what the professional reviewers called the 'sexual tension.' Let me start by saying Im no prude, nor am I always against your gratuitous nudity, but... the camera just seemed to love Jenny's crotch, and undies.. even before they came across the Aboriginal boy and the 'tension'. At the watering hole, it made special point of watching her put her undies back on.Later you have several other nude scenes, including through the water crotch scenes of Jenny as she just, for whatever reason, decides to take a nude swim in a pond.. a scene where she is changing, or just sitting around an abandoned farm house topless when she finds out the aboriginal boy is watching and quickly puts her top back on. To the end where the movie where she flashes back to this time later in live when the three kids decided to have a nice nude swim together.Again, she's supposed to be like 15 years old. I felt like Pete Townshend, and that the cops were going to bust me for just watching this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On balance a good film but one part troubled me a bit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Walkabout" is a film that begins with no real context and the characters NEVER have any names nor do you really learn much about them other than they are English. A man takes two kids (one about 6 years-old and the other practically an adult) into the Australian outback for a picnic. However, inexplicably, he tries to kill them and then kills himself. The pair (you're not even positive they are siblings) are forced to fend for themselves---two city kids in the middle of no where. Eventually, an Aboriginal teen on his 'walkabout' (a rite of passage into adulthood) meets them and saves them. Then, he helps them find their way back to white civilization, though the way back is very circuitous."Walkabout" is a pretty good movie. The scenery from the outback was very nice and the film was quite the interesting adventure. Considering we do NOT have wombats, kangaroos, wild budgies and the like here in the US, it was nice to see all this as well as learn about Aboriginals. Now I am not saying it's a great film, as it's very thin on story and seems to meander quite a bit--especially when they kind of make it back to civilization...kind of. Its resolution at this point was very slow in coming and the kids found white folks but didn't seem keen on asking them to call the police or some other authorities and this made no sense at all. Also, I did get tired of all the shots of animals being consumes by flies and maggots as well as the meat slicing clips. I got the imagery but felt it was occasionally driven home way too hard--subtle, it wasn't. But, on balance it is well done and worth seeing.Finally, I have one thing about the movie that did bother me a lot. There is a very, very long and unnecessary nude scene with the girl (Jenny Agutter). While Agutter was about 18 when the film was shot, her character's age seemed about 16. I don't know how old the Aboriginal guy was supposed to be, but the little boy did a couple brief nude scenes. And so, I am worried that pedophiles might REALLY, REALLY enjoy this film. Perhaps I am sensitive since I used to be a psychotherapist who worked with sexual abuse victims--though I do think filmmakers need to think about these things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually good but the `nature good development bad' chant gets a bit monotonous after a while and the plot is just forgotten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two English children are taken out into the desert for a picnic by a man who then tries to kill them. They flee into the outback after he kills himself and try to fend for themselves. They are close to giving up when they are found by an Aborigine boy who is also alone in the outback undergoing his `coming of age' ritual. They follow him and bond with him as he helps them survive.I had heard good things about this film, as many people will have done, so decided to watch it. The basic plot is not that well developed (the characters are not even given names) and the reason for them being in the situation they are can only be guessed. However this is not a film that is really about the main narrative but more about the heavy subtext. I'm sure to Australians there are issues of race around this film but to me, an outsider from these issues, I took it to be about nature versus industrialisation rather than white and black. The film doesn't really hid this very well and every scene is punctuated with this message in some way or another. While the narrative was enough to keep me watching, this message got a bit heavy after a short time.I stayed watching to see what happened to the boy and girl, but the film kept labouring the point about nature/aborigine good, industrialisation/white men bad. After half the film I thought it would do something else, but it just kept making the same point over and over, even letting the narrative go more and more (if that's even possible) towards the end. When Roeg contrasts the mountains with an abandoned mine I was ready to quit. In fact the film even abandons the ending I was waiting for, and goes with a flash-forward in time that hammers it's point home just in case I was too stupid to get it!The cast are OK but have not much to do. Agutter is good, even if her nudity was not called for on this occasion. Roeg is annoying and irritating but that's the point I think, but the film screws Gulpilil by not giving him a character to speak of and just uses him as a walking allegory.The film looks good and uses the outback well, and it looks about as good as washed out desert can be made to look. Some have said this is reason enough to watch it - but I think this is not enough by itself. The narrative is OK but is never really the focus and it shows throughout right up till the disappointing ending. The subtext is worthy but Roeg laid it on so very thick that I could only wonder if he thought we were all thick.Overall this film looks good and has a worthy message along with a plot with potential. However everything falls by the wayside as Roeg hammers home his point over and over again to the extent that I wished he would at least have had more than one point! Maybe worth seeing once as you may be the type of person who will fall in love with this film, but I found nothing to watch once I'd been told the point for the 15th time (10 minutes in, sadly).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched the film for the first time last night. I consider myself to be of above average intelligence concerning art in general, and film in particular. This film has echoes of those Italian cannibal films of around the same time period- but with even more tedious plot and more self-indulgent (and pointless) camera / editing tricks. For those who derive sexual gratification from upskirt camera shots and killing animals- this film is for you. Maybe zooming the camera in on every passing crotch and breast passes for high-artistic endeavor in Australia, but the extended nudity, and self-described eroticism of a 14 year old actress surprises me that the DVD is available in the States. Like nearly every film I've seen from Oz- it's long, boring, looks like a 13 year old boy was holding the camera and alludes to a lot of social and racial issues that are not relevant outside of the Southern Hemisphere.</fullReview>

If the editors would cut these scenes the duration of the movie would come down probably to 40 minutes and it wouldn't be that interesting any more :).
