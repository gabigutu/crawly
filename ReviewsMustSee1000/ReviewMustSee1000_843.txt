		<shortDescription>A few hair-pin turns before the 16 blocks are traversed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a remake of "The Gauntlet," though the theme is a familiar one. There are, in fact, several movies with similar plots; "3:10 to Yuma" and "Narrow Margin" come to mind. A reviewer emailed me that "Midnight Run" not only has a story like "16 Blocks" but Bruce Willis' character Jack Mosley has a name that is a composite of the movie names for two of the leading roles in "Midnight Run": Robert De Niro's Jack Walsh and Yaphet Kotto's FBI Agent Alonzo Mosely. This, of course, may be mere coincidence. Though the story may seem like déj? vu, the action is fast paced making this an exciting film to watch.Anyone who doubts that Bruce Willis can act needs only watch his standout performance in "Pulp Fiction" to see what depth this actor can bring to a demanding role. The role of Jack Mosely may not be challenging to Willis, but he still gives it all he's got which is plenty. Playing the part of an over the hill New York cop with a game leg, nothing to live for, and a drinking problem seems easy for Willis to make it all believable.The criminal, Eddie Bunker, Jack must deliver to testify within a certain time frame is played with gusto by hip-hop artist Mos Def. Eddie is the most verbose prisoner ever. He rattles on and on about anything that comes to mind, some of it funny, some of it trite. He also has a riddle that is not answered till near the end of the film.A standout performance is delivered by David Morse as the leader of the dirty cops, Frank Nugent. Morse is in danger of becoming typecast as a dishonest lawman. I'm hopeful he will become more diversified in his roles since he is such a talented actor.This is another winner from action director Richard Donner. If you like his other successful concoctions such as the "Lethal Weapon" flicks, "Superman," "Conspiracy Theory," and "The Omen," then you will certainly enjoy "16 Blocks."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I underestimated 16 Blocks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't entirely sure this movie would stick out from the rest but I chose to go since I had nothing else to do. Hell am I glad I was bored. 16 Blocks is a wonderful thrill ride with lots of action/suspense and mild comedy. Any Bruce Willis fan would love this like they did Hostage. Willis plays Jack Mosley, a drunk/hungover cop that seems to have lost his touch. He gets all the scrap jobs that no one wants and one of these jobs brings him straight to Mos Def who plays Eddie, a very hard to understand, very talkative guy who has apparently witnessed something and is due to testify at 10 sharp. It's about 2 hours until he has to be at the court house which is 16 blocks away and a hell of a lot of cops standing in the middle. Mosley doesn't entirely know what to believe, the kid or his ex partner of 20 years but he puts his faith into the kid and the thrill ride begins. Hands down the best dirty cop film I've seen in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was an excellent surprise. It starts slow, but stay with it. Your first look at Bruce Willis as the burnt-out over the hill cop tells you this will not be the normal shoot-em-up cop drama. The plot starts building almost instantly, unlike many movies where you have to wait through thirty minutes of fluff before the story goes anywhere. The characters in the movie are surprisingly endearing, honest and genuine. They're just normal enough to identify with. Not the standard super evil villain and valiant good guy. Bruce Willis is awesome in his role as the tired underdog struggling with the morality of torn loyalty. Mos Def, whose character's voice was a little aggravating, played an excellent supporting role. The relationship he develops with Willis'character is both surprising and humorous. Overall, the movie was tense from the start and is filled with suspense, humor and a great deal of drama. It takes some unexpected turns and has a great ending. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oustanding Performances by Bruce Willis and Mos Def</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Bruce Willis' finest films yet. He plays a tired old cop who is handed the menial task of driving Mos Def, a criminal, who has to testify in court. Little does he know, he winds up running into very much trouble. Although one might think that this movie cannot be suspenseful because it takes place within the radius of 16 blocks, many twists and turns occur which make it very interesting. Mos Def also delivers an outstanding performance through the use of his accent and his hilarious anecdotes throughout the movie. He adds a lot of depth to his character and to the movie as a whole. Thus, the audience is able to sympathize with him. Overall, this movie was excellent and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a great fast paced thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>16 Blocks is intense, suspenseful, and even funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Willis is known for being a great action movie star. Richard Donner is known for being a great action director. The combination of these two should create great hype. I saw this the first day it was out and I guess it almost lived up to my expectations. Bruce Willis portrays Jack Mosley, a alcoholic cop who, after a long day of work, has to escort a prisoner to a trial for a testimony. Mos Def plays Eddie Bunker, the prisoner with a dream of becoming a baker. They have to go 16 blocks in a little bit over a hour. They encounter multiple attempts on Eddie's life, and Mosley begins to suspect other cops of this. 16 Blocks is an intense thrill ride with multiple twists. Great camera angles that create more suspense help you really understand what they are going through. David Morse did a great job playing the dirty cop. The only problem is that it has some parts that would make you laugh. This may take away the seriousness of the movie from some viewers. It can be corny and predictable at times, but 16 Blocks is a good flick and you should see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certainly a decent cop - thriller; it's quite entertaining despite some actions sequences that are really unlikely (they could also be called brainless). In fact credulity is put to the test a lot of times, nevertheless "16 Blocks" is a kind of movie that makes you reflect on what you saw. Bruce Willis plays the unusual part of a broken down cop ready for both rehabilitation and retirement, weary of working and living as well; Bruce has never looked more unkempt and scruffy but his part his acting is really persuasive and cogent. The ending could (should) have been less predictable but the job is in my opinion well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen a movie in years that would be able to touch me as deep as this movie did. Here you won't see piteous freaks or ill children. Just two adults: one elderly white cop and one young black guy (even not really a criminal). But I'd never believe how touching one action-packed day of their lives can be! There are dozens of a-cop-and-a-criminal movies like this but they are all not nearly like this! They are stupid and I never liked that kind of flicks. This movie is splendid. It really should be something to make such a fantasy/sci-fi fan like me to like a criminal drama (not really a drama, read further). Maybe the very idea of the film is plain, maybe the plot has somewhat unrealistic turns (who proved that real life hasn't?) but the characters and their behavior is so real, full of senses and inside thoughts that their acting touches the very soul! And the thing I really loved: unlike many "high art" movies this one ends realistically WELL because, maybe I am too naive, God is kind and life is not a movie. Such a movie ends well: it was really a kind surprise for me! My bow to the director, he's genius. The actors as well. Someone is still able to shoot truly remarkable movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>saw preview in NYC. Fun action flick. somewhat derivative but some good audience laughter in right spots and applause when appropriate. should have good broad based appeal. didn't fall asleep which, these days, is a good sign. Bruce Willis does weary hero well though its unclear why his character does what he does. Mos Def is funny and engaging but nasal voice is annoying after awhile. Best job is by David Morse who is completely believable as a NYC cop though somewhat unbelievable in terms of what he will go through to do what he feels he must do. Others have drawn parallels to The Gauntlet with Clint Eastwood and there are definite similar themes and scenes but , obviously , more updated and , actually fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some good elements but they fail to fully come together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"16 Blocks" features an aging Bruce Willis as a broken-down, burned out NYPD detective assigned to transport the key witness in a police corruption trial from his jail cell to the courthouse where he is scheduled to testify 16 blocks away. However, something goes terribly awry when the cops who are the targets of his testimony attempt to knock off the witness, forcing Willis and his charge to run for their lives through the crowded streets and deserted back alleys of downtown Manhattan."16 Blocks" deserves points for at least attempting to provide a bit more in the way of characterization and theme than we are used to in run-of-the-mill police procedurals, but the film winds up falling flat despite the best of intentions and some first rate performances by Willis and Mos Def as the man whose life Willis feels compelled to protect. For even though the low-keyed approach writer Richard Wenk and director Richard Donner have taken towards the material should have made this a more believable and realistic film than most in its genre, the filmmakers keep undercutting that truth by having the two fleeing gentlemen go through so many hairbreadth escapes that we begin to think that not only are these NYPD officers corrupt but amazingly incompetent as well. Moreover, the schmaltzy, humanity-of-man ending, with its theme of mutually achieved salvation and redemption, comes across as a contrived piece of sentimental uplift that never rings true or convincing.What's good about the movie is its occasionally witty one liners and the performances by the actors in the two lead roles. Willis, craggy-faced, gimpy and sporting a noticeable middle-age spread, is subtle and subdued in the role of a man who has grown apathetic and cynical over the years, and Mos Def makes a very compelling character out of Eddie Bunker, the criminal-with-a-heart-of-gold who never stops talking, but whose deadpan, singsong delivery endears him to the audience. The actors alone compensate for the underdeveloped script and the overall sense of ennui that permeates the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People Can Change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, the alcoholic and decadent detective Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis) is assigned to deliver a prisoner to the court sixteen blocks far from his precinct in 118 minutes. Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) made a deal with the D.A. office and will identify and testify against a dirty detective. While driving to the tribunal, Jack is attacked by a group of corrupt cops and protects Eddie.In spite of being a flawed movie, "16 Blocks" is a good entertainment with lots of action and an optimistic, hopeful and commercial message in the end that people can change, with the redemption of Eddie and Jack. Mos Def irritates with his accent, and Bruce Willis is totally different from his usual shape, inclusive with a "tire" on his belly. It is funny to see all the damage caused by the bus in Manhattan and no press and no interventions of Ada MacDonald (Brenda Pressley), who was interested in the case. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "16 Quadras" ("16 Blocks")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was good action flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Saw this Movie and was happy with how it came out. A good movie definitely worth seeing. a lot of action, tied in with a lot of twists. In that sense i mean you go "oh hes about to get caught" when the unexpected comes up. Was good acting as well all around, Bruce Willis made a fine Hero, or anti hero if you could call him that. The beginning started off fast and the ending came on slow. in my opinion the way a movie should come on. About the pg13 though, F bomb was dropped once (twice if you count a replay of it saying) The musical score also did a nice touch to the scenes. Dropping to low sad tones when death is about to occur, and jumping to a pulsing drum run when escape is occurring. Overall i give an 9/10 as very little was wrong if anything at all. I mean as a matter of fact besides maybe length or questionably of motives, i would say there is no problems at all found in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from all other variables this film is ruined by one thing and one thing only: Blabbermouth Mos DeF.My god, this is the first time I have EVER seen a fair-budget movie been wasted by something like this. For a couple of weeks now my headphone has got a nasty screek which is annoying, but it's not half as bad as the continuous blabber in the most annoying tone of voice I have ever heard. After a good fifteen minutes a was yelling to my screen to shut him up. After 30 minutes I was praying to God to keep him quiet. After 45 minutes I was about ready to jump out of my window.Thank God I got the sense to just press the eject button. And I think I will now play some deathmetal albums volume up to get rid of that nasty blabber echo still in my head.Avoid this like the plague.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ummm....It's been awhile since I've seen a movie that bad... wow...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I start? Bruce Willis should not be allowed to grow a mustache. But no, that's not my main complaint.The main story in the movie is that he (Bruce) has roughly 2 hrs to transport a prisoner from the cell block to the court house, yet the cops are trying to stop him. OK, good idea. I'd watch the movie based on that.The movie is slow from start to finish. I don't mind slow movies with a purpose. King Kong, for example, is slow in the beginning, yet I love it. 2001: A Space Odessy and The Birds are very slow, yet I find them good movies. This movie was slow because of poor writing. If you want to see some well done writing that is done in real time (1 hr video is 1 hr of story), watch 24.But it goes down hill rapidly. Bruce Willis plays a depressed detective that really doesn't give a rip about his job. He's always tired. He's old and run down. He doesn't "snap out of it" enough to make his character interesting.The prisoner, Mos Def. What the crap? Does he have mental problems? Is he a little eccentric? Is he just annoying? It's not clear. And what is up with his voice? The story was not written well. There were a lot of continuity errors. Like Bruce calls for some help, yet not only do they never show up, but they're never mentioned again. It's like it never happened. Then there were times where they acted like they had 5 minutes to get to the court house, times where they acted like they had 5 hours, and time where they acted like they'd given up on making it, or the time had already passed.Far too many times, the bad guys were able to guess exactly where Bruce was going, yet it seems way to perfect. Almost like, he's a white male, aged 40, I bet he went to his old friend from college that works at K-mart for advice. That's not what happened, but it was way to precise of a guess to be written off as smart bad guys.O, and the ending was predictable. There was a slight twist that I didn't see coming, but nothing huge. In the end, Bruce's character is still his old tired self, except he now likes his birthday.The only movies I've seen that are worse are, Bulletproof Monk and Sphere. Bruce, I hope you get back to some real movies soon, like Sin City, Six Sense and Pulp Fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you watch this movie be sure you are able to mute the sound. Not only that Mos Def only talks about opening up a bakery and baking cakes for children's' birthdays he does not even stop talking about it throughout the whole film. If I was Bruce Willis in this movie I would have shut him myself just to make him quiet. Apart from that the film contains lots of illogical behaviour from different characters. To sum up one can say that the flick was good in the first twenty minutes. Then Mos Def begins to fall on ones nerves what makes the the film worse and with the beginning of the bus kidnapping it loses any existence authorization. I wasn't as angry after watching a film as I was after watching '16 Blocks' for a long long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willis tries a change of pace.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we first see Bruce Willis dragging himself up the stairs, his weariness as a human, and a cop, is evident. He is a spent man, a drunk, a Schmo, uncomplainingly taking on the scut work his brothers hand out to him. As it is Bruce Willis, and as we have seen the preview, we know that there is going to be an Epiphany moment around the corner. It comes when he is asked to look the other way as his buddy's (most prominently David Morse, as the sociopathic ex partner) rub out an informant that Willis is dutifully transporting to the Court house.When it comes, Willis keeps the brakes on, and continues to move slowly up to his crowning moment. Perhaps too slowly. For an action movie there is much down time, time enough for Def Moses to steal the movie, which is O.K., because in this movie Bruce is content to let his Co- Star have all the best lines, and most of the best scenes. Thankfully both stay in character, so that the unexpected ending fits into the movie without jarring the mood of the piece. The mood is just like Willis's character: dark, weary, and dispassionate. It is, in the end, a movie that focuses on character rather than action. Just when I thought that the movie was going to have me accepting the epiphany as a typical Hollywood cliché, it offers an explanation that is quite believable.I like my action movies to go at breakneck speed with occasional breaks to catch my breath. This one takes so many breaks that the pace often slows and my interest started to wander, but it had enough twists and "unlikely" moments that allowed our heroes to escape, that it kept the interest from waning too much.Too often I had a hard time hearing Def, as he speaks in a street patois that, like most popular music, is ironically lyrical: it has a beat but the lyrics are hard to focus on. Like Bruce he keeps the brakes on, and I am grateful he did not go down the road of playing his role in the obligatory street wise, hyped up, smart ass jive mother******. He lets his character grow likable, and has the patience to let us catch up with him.************SPOILER*****************The premise of the movie is too laughable. Who is going to believe the testimony of a lowly Black "Hemmorhoid" over the word of dozens of New York's finest?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why won't that guy shut up?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The annoying voice was bad enough, but the fact that he NEVER shut up at any point in the movie made this thing unwatchable. As they flee in the streets and hide from people trying to kill them, they still have time to sit and babble endlessly, and always loud enough to ensure that anyone looking could find them. Without ruining the movie for anyone who wants to witness this trash for themselves, I will say that the bus scene is the most absurd and annoying of them all.Mos Def ruined the movie all on his own, but Willis didn't really do anything stop him. He could play this part the way he did in his sleep, and it looks like he did. The man playing the archetypal "bad cop" was just as lazy adding nothing to the hackneyed script and even contributing to its unoriginality with clichés of his own. This character's mindlessness, particularly in his final scene, was idiotic to the point of insult.To be fair, the plot was interesting enough. If it were a little less cliché and unrealistic, and much better done, this movie would be as good as any run of the mill action thriller-type. I did find myself trying to add complexity and originality to the story as it went, though. As it is, it has to be one of the biggest wastes of time and $7.00 available to the general public.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly terrible movie.In most suspense films one is asked to"suspend disbelief" at some moment in order for the film to continue to entertain and keep you involved. In "16 Blocks" you are asked to suspend disbelief in the first 10 minutes of the film, regarding the basic premise of the movie. I found the premise and the execution of the plot of the film to be an imposition upon me, my time, and my money. It is poor movie of the week TV fare.Bruce Willis is so obviously an alcoholic mess from the start that I shudder at the thought that the "blue wall" of police solidarity would close around him even for a moment. It is a shame that David Morse, an admirable actor in so many ways, is stuck in this mess.Why don't movies come with a money back guarantee. This one certainly should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly decent for a familiar Hollywood cops 'n' bad guys thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>16 BLOCKS is a neat little Hollywood thriller that might not offer the bulldozing excitement of a DIE HARD movie or the fantastic stuntwork of a MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE flick, but which still generates plenty of suspense from its straightforward premise. It tells the story of a cop and a criminal, two men who have to cross New York before their deadline runs out. Of course, there's a lot more at stake than it first appears, and gradually director Richard Donner weaves a story of friendship, betrayal, skeletons in the closet and, above all else, the need to "do the right thing". It's a story that's character-focused throughout, with the emphasis on the developing relationship between Bruce Willis' detective and Mos Def's criminal. Some might find this emphasis off putting, but I for one thoroughly enjoyed it.Bruce Willis is much as we met him in DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE (and indeed there are many parallels and references to that movie in this one); he's washed up, past his glory, except here he's even worse, saddled with a paunch and a gammy leg. Once the bullets start flying, Bruce's character takes a turn for the better and he becomes the everyday hero we all know and love him for. I was prepared to dislike Mos Def's high-talking criminal but, surprisingly enough, he's one of the best things in the film, and he really makes the criminal character his own, adding warmth to the feature. David Morse, off our screens for too long, is as great as ever as the corrupt cop who becomes the nemesis of the heroes.While the film is not action-focused, there are some highly impressive set-pieces which strive for realism ? the stand-out scene being the bus hostage rescue, of course. Elsewhere, the layer of gritty realism ? no pyrotechnics here ? and the endless cops-vs-robbers stealthy sneaking around generate plenty of tension and also excitement. My only real complaint is with the ending, which could have been handled a little better, but then it chooses emotion over action and it's a character-focused finale rather than one with big bangs. I remember a few years back when the film S.W.A.T. attempted a similar storyline; the difference is, that film was a piece of crap, and this one is rather good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average Cop Movie is Average</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story: The story is fairly archetypal within the police procedural genre: A beat down cop defends an innocent on the run from the polished but corrupt police establishment. There are many, many cop movies that share this premise, and most of them are written so much better. I'm going to get crucified when I say this but even Street Kings had a more inspired version of the same story, and LA Confidential has no fears of this movie ever catching up to it either. The archetype works, so this story isn't bad, but it just feels adequate and lifeless. C Acting: Mos Def's character annoyed me so badly that I kept hoping his character would die in this movie, and the worst part is that I know he can do better, like he did in Be Kind Rewind. Bruce Willis does an effective job of playing an alcoholic cop, but nothing terribly memorable here. The real show stealer was David Morse as one of the most likable villains in the history of movies. He's doing a horrible thing, but he just seems like such a nice guy while doing it, and he'd probably even invite Willis over for supper after the dust settled, assuming he got his way. He's good... and he bumps the acting category up to C level.Direction: The atmosphere is very depressing, which was probably by design for this story. There are lots of awkward pauses, lots of Willis giving confused looks and looks of disdain for his life instead of a reply to of character's dialog. Again, this is perfectly acceptable, but not exceptional. It's average, and average direction gets a C.Visuals: This is probably the strongest part of this movie. The visuals make use of lots of shadow, which assist the atmosphere of depression. The Godfather has no worries of losing it's title of best use of shadows in a movie, but this is really this movie's strong point. BOverall: This movie is okay. Average. If it's on TV and you've got nothing better to do, watch it. If your local library has it, rent it. I wouldn't pay anymore than about five dollars to watch this one. And you certainly don't need to be searching this one out unless you're a huge fan of some member of the cast or crew. C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intrigue , action and suspense with a sensational Bruce Willis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film concerns an experienced but tiring cop named Jack (Bruce Willis) about his retirement . The aging detective is assigned the last mission , transporting sixteen blocks away a foul-mouthed delinquent , from the precinct until the court . He is aware that the African-American young named Eddie Buken (Mos Def) is allegedly to testify against NYPD agents . He made a covenant with the D.A. office for identifying corrupt detectives at courthouse . Meantime , along the way , they're attacked by vicious gunfighters and pursued by all N.Y.C policemen and they find themselves under siege into a bus and surrounded by the SWAT . Then , they team up to flee , trying to get out towards the trial building .The movie displays suspense , action ,thriller and is very entertaining . The film's writer, Richard Wenk, has reported that he originally conceived of the project with himself as writer and director and, before shopping it around to anyone else, first approached Richard Donner because they had a struck up a good relationship when Donner really liked his rewrite of a script for Lethal weapon 4 (1998) , even though that script was not used . It's a special buddy movie between a dreary , boozy cop magnificently played by Bruce Willis and a fast-talking prisoner well acted by Mos Def , detaching an agreeable chemistry . Although the film is principally interpreted by two main actors also contains exceptional performances by its entire secondary cast , especially by David Morse and Jenna Stern . Living musical score adjusted appropriately to the action by Klaus Badelt and adequate cinematography by Glen McPherson . The movie produced by Milennium (Trevor Short ,Boaz Davidson , Danny Lerner) usually producers of low-medium budget but here was lavishly filmed . The motion picture was professionally directed by the veteran Richard Donner . He's an action cinema specialist with numerous titles (Assassin , Conspiracy theory , Timeline , Lethal Weapon I..). Rating : Better than average . It's a must see for Bruce Willis fans in spite of his characterization as an old man .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great film....honestly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had everything that makes a good thriller and also becomes a memorable film with the great ending that really left you with a great feeling about friendship and change. The acting was great. Of course Bruce Willis wont get any credit at all for his performance because " hes ot a good actor" which is just ridiculous and i don't even wanna go off on this because it will take too long. Mos Def was great too even tho the voice was a bit testing but in the end it also proved memorable. David Morse was in my opinion the best part about the movie...the guy is just so cool and rather witty at times as well. A great movie and even though the movie didn't gross 4830385954 dollars like some cruise movie....it should prove that bruce willis and his films will go down to be much better then those of the box office boys like cruise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Police Drama Of The Decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Donner is back with one of the best police dramas of all time.Bruce Willis is back too, with the role of his career. Forget Willis's past. This is his magnum opus. He plays that character he's played so many times before only this time he knows what works and what doesn't. His performance alone is worth watching this movie. He plays the old washed-out, alcoholic cop that finds a chance to redeem himself and takes it. This is the equivalent of Clint Eastwood's role in 'The Unforgiven'.Mos Def is excellent too. He shows real maturity and control over his performance. David Morse is the icing on the cake. He plays the villain you hate to love. His performance is worth an Oscar for supporting role.The harmonious combination of all these elements is because of Richard Donner being behind the camera. Of course he has done the 'Lethal Weapon' series and with '16 Blocks' he gets the chance to show the dark side of police stories. The most important element in the movie is the sense of realistic intensity, projected by Willis' outstanding performance.Seeing Steve Kahan in the movie made me feel warm inside. I wish Richard Donner would make films more often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, slightly underrated on IMDb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has a good mix of action and dialogue. The story is really good and original compared to a lot of movies in this genre. The plot is not too complicated but still has suspense throughout. Bruce Willis does these action films really well, I think its his screen presence. Mos Def has good chemistry with Bruce Willis, although he speaks just a bit too fast for me. There are humorous and also serious scenes which makes you feel for the characters and you sense a friendship forming. The villain also has quite a few lines and is well acted with strong emotion and adds to the impact of the story. If you want to watch a decent action movie after a long day in the office, this is it. It is currently rated 6.6 which I think is a bit harsh, probably 7.5 :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis gives one of his best acting performances as the alcoholic cop Det Jack Mosley I was not so convinced by the irritating performance by Mos Def of small time crook Eddie Bunker, who apparently is due to give evidence against another policeman at the courthouse 16 blocks away. Now if they had accepted evidence by video link? Anyway, Willis has to defend attempts by his colleagues to eliminate the witness. Cue a struggle of good against evil.I loved the pace of this film (at least in the first half) and Willis's believable performance. David Morse is good too. The scenes between Willis and Morse must have pleased the team.The camera-work is first rate and the editing tight. There's a basic flaw in the plot in that Bunker's testimony would be easily pulled apart by a half decent lawyer. But let's not let that get in the way of things here. We'll assume the bad cops don't have access to a good legal team.All in all, it's a good but not great film. It descends into sentimentality at the end and ultimately the chemistry between the two leads isn't quite there. I also got a bit fed up with all the cake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who would have thought they could pack so much action into such a short journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great movie! Bruce Willis plays a washed up cop given the assignment to take a witness (Mos Def) from the holding cell to the courthouse, a mere 16 blocks in two hours. The catch is that the people who have something to lose upon this witness' testimony have no intention on letting him make it there. The thrill is in watching just how much action can take place on such a short journey, and in holding your breath to see who is going to win this dogfight.Willis' character is quite flawed, Mos Def's character is more than a little bit annoying, and some of the other cops are more than a little bit evil. There are some twists throughout the movie that save it from being too formula-driven, and some scenes that made me jump in my seat. I found myself drawn to the characters despite their obvious flaws, I thought they were well developed. Willis did a good job matching his acting to his physical appearance (he didn't act the part of some super hero). It has action and some thrills, Willis is at his acting best, and overall this film is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willis and Def On The Run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Donner's '16 Blocks' turns out to be a pleasant surprise. I thought this would be another ditsy Bruce Willis action flick but it is better than that and more layered. Right from the beginning the story sets into motion, getting straight to the point rather than dilly dally with useless subplots. Its got that element of suspense and action but the characters, especially the two leads, are also properly defined. I liked the way the Mosley and Bunker's relationship develops and it is portrayed with some great humour.In addition to that, they're very human. Bunker is just anyone who wants to start his own business to make his dream come tree. Mosley is just another washed out employee who's been in his profession for too long and has made some mistakes for which he thinks its too late to redeem himself.The chase sequences and shootout scenes are shot well. I also enjoyed the sequence in the bus, especially Bunker's interactions with the passengers. Easily, the highlight of '16 Blocks' is the camaraderie between Mosley and Bunker. Bruce Willis is great as the washed-out sleep-deprived copper who unwittingly finds himself caught in a web of morality and loyalty. Mos Def is splendid as the aspiring Baker, whose had his issues with the law, but all he wants is his own bakery. David Morse is good too, especially in the sequences where he tries to smoothetalk Mosley into giving up Bunker. Jenna Stern makes a nice appearance as Mosley's sister.Some of the action sequences are over the top but that doesn't make '16 Blocks' less exciting but the film is mainly likable for its characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>16 Blocks sort of went under the radar when it was originally released. I guess at the time it was released, there was great ambivalence towards movies in general, but this is changing. However, in the current marketplace, this film would probably not have fared very well either. Bruce Willis plays a tired, aging cop - which is appropriate for him, being a tired, again action star - who is transporting Mos Def sixteen blocks to the courthouse where he will testify against police corruption. Obviously this task is quite more involved than just driving the distance, as becomes obvious right from the outset. Overall, this is your basic action film, but at the end it becomes much more. The acting is brilliant, the story complex, and the editing is good. I don't think it's worth repeat viewings, but it is definitely worth the rental. Make sure to watch the alternate ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 16 Blocks (2006) made by Richard Donner (whose films include Superman (1978), four Lethal Weapon movies, Maverick, Conspiracy Theory among others), Bruce Willis plays Jack Mosley, a tired broken drunk detective in NYC. One morning, after his night shift is over, he gets an assignment to escort a witness-criminal named Eddie (Mos Def) to a grand jury hearing which 16 blocks away from headquarters is. The witness has to get to court in next 118 minutes but on the way somebody wants him dead and they have all means and determination to have it happen. The kid, like everyone calls Eddie is going to testify against corruption and drug dealing within the very police department where Jack used to work and where he has long time friends and colleagues, including his former partner for many years, Det. Frank Nugent (David Morse). Now Jack and Eddie are against New York's bravest and time is certainly not on their side while they are on the trip through 16 Blocks in Chinatown to make it in time to court and preferably alive.For the first 70 minutes I loved the film but then, the creators made an implausible turn in the script which made me cringe but even the way it turned, the movie was fun to watch -the combination of Action/Crime/Thriller almost always makes me happy. The DVD features an alternate ending which I like a lot and I wish it could make it to the theatrical release. It is more logical and fits the film but I can understand why the movie makers decided to go with the different ending. Another thing - you can't go wrong with Bruce Willis. The guy was born to play the tough cops who never give up and who are good in saving the city, the country, the world, the humankind or just one petty criminal and to give him a chance to re-start his life and do something out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie I have watched a couple of times. Firstly what stands out is the versatility of both lead characters. Mos def plays an almost innocent young blood who just fell on the bad side of luck. Bruce Willis plays a cop who never faced the harsh realities of his past actions is drawn by the soft nature of Mos Def. The audience's empathy with the character grows and what made me like the plot was the pursuit of doing the right thing in the face of obstacles. Credit to the whole cast really. Direction of the movie keeps pace with the plot and the ending is as touching as is the beginning shocking. The movie deserves a second look for all those who think it is a 6/7 because it is much more than a cop movie as the plot is far more in depth than what is seen on the surface. Even people not a great fan of Bruce Willis this one is one to be enjoyed and is not your run of mill the cop chase!! Popcorn please...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>16 Blocks is a smart action/thriller movie. The characters behave like "real people" would in such a situation. Even the villains behave believably. The action is well-staged. The suspense is high. It's not just a guy movies. Women will like it too.SPOILER ALERT: The body-count is low, and this is one of the things that helps with the believability. In many cop/action movies, there are so many people who die, that after a while, as a viewer, you get desensitized to the whole plot. In this movie, everything is real.The performances are strong. Bruce Willis plays the old, tired cop character he did so effectively in Sin City and some other movies. His character is so depressive that he's hard to watch at times. Mo Def plays an annoying small-time criminal, and is purposely annoying, though that character can get wearing too. David Morse is brilliant as the cool, level-headed bad cop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is terribly, wretchedly, god-awfully horrible. In fact, I can't recall the last time I saw a movie that was so bad. Please, for the love of god, don't watch this movie! The worst part is that I had a vested interest in liking this movie. Let me explain. The bulk of this stinker was filmed in Toronto, and some of it was even filmed in my apartment building. The scene where Mos and Bruce get chased into the Chinese dude's apartment, and the elevator scene - those were filmed in my building.It was definitely interesting to see how Hollywood works "up close" (example: painting over our ancient stairwell, only to re-paint it with fake "handprints" and grime - like the original wasn't grimy enough). I even got to briefly meet Bruce Willis, which was a cheap thrill, although there was no eye contact - his gaze was downcast the entire time. I guess he was getting into character... I also found it interesting that a 10 minute sequence in a movie would inconvenience our entire building for several weeks - no elevator, cables and equipment strewn everywhere, etc.In any event, I was pretty pumped about getting to see my humble abode on the big screen. Unfortunately, that's the only enjoyment I got out of this terrible, terrible movie. It almost doesn't bear discussing, it's simply that bad.The plot is clichéd as all-friggin-hell. Everything reeks of paint-by-numbers script-writing and characterization. Trust me, this is nothing you haven't seen fifty million times before. There's absolutely no suspense, drama, or interest. I just wanted it to be over as quickly as possible. And Mos Def is simply maddeningly annoying and deserves to have his Screen Actor's Guild membership revoked.This movie is beyond bad. In fact, it surpasses bad and achieves the status of disturbingly bad. What can you say about an "action" movie where the most exciting scene consists of a bus speeding down an alley destroying air conditioning units? Avoid this tripe at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I almost gave up on this movie after about 15 minutes because of the annoyance of Mos Def's voice. What was up with that!? By the end this became an okay crime drama as Bruce Willis plays a burnt out (alcoholic) NYPD detective escorting a small-time crook the (16 blocks) to a grand-jury session.Willis is impressive with his burnt-out-edness. His character does not resemble any kind of action hero here; unfit, overweight, unattractive, shuffling, gasping for a drink. Well done. And while I like David Morse his character was a bit over-the-top. I mean, I get that they're crooked cops but really, shooting wildly into a crowded NY street and a bus full of civilians. Did the bad cops think they were completely above the law or any repercussions? That they could just do whatever they wanted without consequence? Reminded me a bit of that opening scene with Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L Jackson from "The Other Guys" except that was a comedy. I will say that this grew on me by the end though. 06.13</fullReview>

He's roped in to bring witness Eddie (Mos Def) from jail to the courthouse to testify. It's a distance of 16 blocks. Then people start trying to kill Eddie including Jack's former partner Det. Frank Nugent (David Morse).This is a surprisingly tense thriller from director Richard Donner. Bruce is playing an older drunk John McClane. Mos Def is pretty fun as jittery talking machine. David Morse has great intensity. The cat and mouse game is very compelling. And the chemistry between Jack and Eddie develops very nicely. This is a great tense thriller.

		<shortDescription>Solid Action Pick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Willis does an excellent turn on "16 Blocks." For an old guy, he still got it here. He plays Detective Mosley, and Mosley's reason for hi-jacking an MTA bus coincides with his desire to successfully escort a fast-talking witness, Eddie Bunker (played with sublime brilliance by Mos Def), from police custody to a courthouse. The title of the film is derived from the distance--"16 Blocks"--between the police precinct where Bunker has been held to the courthouse where he is due to testify.Relative to the plot: aging cop must escort witness 16 blocks, going into the film I had doubts that Director Richard Donner and Writer Richard Wenk would have enough skill to pull off an action-packed drama, let alone edge-of-your-seat thriller. But, giving credit where credit is due, they surpassed my expectations, and then some.Like Det. Mosley, "16 Blocks" delivers the goods.Of course, one does have to look the other way during some of the movie's sequences, especially the never-ending string of escapes that the gimpy detective and his ever-chatting custodial responsibility make in the course of their short trip. Believe it, Houdini would be impressed by these two if he were still around. Even after Mosley wedges the hi-jacked bus into an alleyway with no outlets they manage to elude their pursuers. But, as we all know by now, that is the nature of "thrillers." Most often the pursued are trapped in no-escape situations by slipping out the back door, or high-tailing it up a stairwell, or, as aforementioned, hi-jacking a city bus.Willis and Def, the two lead characters in the movie, carry the movie, and do so with a combination of dead-pan humor, knowing exchanges, and sheer will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just happened to catch this one on a recent Saturday afternoon, and began watching it, purely out of curiosity, wondering how I missed it's theatrical release, back in 2006. I quickly became interested in it, and I must say that I was very impressed.This is a very well-made movie, expertly handled by director Richard Donner, and Richard Wenk's script - Though not totally new material - Is excellent. A witness with damaging evidence against the police department is remanded to the custody of an aging, weary, ne'er-do-well, booze-soaked detective for escort to the trial. The witness is, of course, a marked man, and the alcoholic detective, soon discovering that he's considered expendable, is nonetheless determined to finally prove himself, do the right thing, and accomplish his mission, with the odds heavily against him.Sound familiar? It should, since that's the basic plot-line of Clint Eastwood's 'The Gauntlet', from 1977. There's even a chase scene involving a bus. However, though not completely fresh material, Wenk re-works it very well, turning it into quite a taut piece, with plenty of action. The acting of all involved, is first rate, and I was particularly impressed with Mos Def's performance as the affable, small- time crook, who has made up his mind to go straight, and realize his dream of opening a specialty bakery.Impressive photography, and a great music score enhance this thoroughly enjoyable movie, and I highly recommend it to Willis fans, or fans of action movies, in general. 7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mos Def-initely Worth A Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You are driving in a hurricane, and you come across a bus stop. At the bus stop there are three people: Bruce Willis, Mos Def and David Morse. In the car there is only room to save two of the people from the storm. Who would you take? This 2006 action movie opens to show an aging and alcoholic cop, Jack Mosley (Willis). He has one simple assignment to accomplish. He needs to escort a witness, Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), from police custody to the courthouse. He has two hours to drive 16 blocks. A simple enough task. Until Mosley comes to the realization that the witness is testifying against other officers from the NYPD. Mosley's friend and colleague, Frank Nugent (Morse), is at the head of a group of cops attempting to kill Bunker before he has a chance to testify.The script is smart and well paced. Dialogue between the two leads is well delivered. The cinematography is not overly impressive although it is nothing to be scoffed at either. The score in the movie fits the mood and story, but there are no stand out tracks either. Aside from the script, the acting is the most impressive part of the movie. Each of the leads delivers a believable and deep portrayal of their character. There is amazing character development from Willis, and the confrontational scenes between Willis and Morse are impressive. There are only two minor issues to be found with the acting. At times Mos Def's voice is slightly whiny and annoying, and Willis at times sounds as though he is out of breath. This is understandable for his character, but it can also distract from the actual script.Overall the movie is an impressive addition to the collection of any action or crime-drama fan. So if in a hurricane with room for only two additional people in the car who would I take? I would give the keys to Willis and let the three of these leads keep going.</fullReview>

Mos Def was funny to watch and also some of his jokes were good. Bruce Willis was hard to recognize at the beginning and delivered a realistic role as an alkalized and old cop that will have finally justice.

That alone would make it only a 4 out of 10 movie. Two characters are half-good-half-bad ? that gains one more point. But yet I had to add two points more because of the final development of it: It is really satisfying, that there are a few movies, in which the bad guys are not simply killed, but facing their legal punishment by law instead (as also seen in "The Negotiator" (1998)). The "change" of Eddie &amp; Jack is also part of this lovely happy ending. So my résumé: worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Action Packed Trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Willis has starred in several suspenseful action thrillers including the 2005 release "Hostage" and the earlier "Die Hard" trilogy (the 1988 original being my personal favorite). In my opinion, this intense police drama qualifies to become a member of that acclaimed group. A few IMDb reviewers have indicated that the character portrayed by Mos Def was aggravating and detracted from their enjoyment of the film. His character was indeed annoying at times, but I felt that was exactly how the character was intended to be and the film would not have been nearly as effective without that ingredient. From my prospective, his performance rather than detracting from the production, substantially added to the overall presentation.The films' title is based on the distance required to transport a key witness from a precinct house to a courthouse to give crucial testimony in a criminal case. Although viewers are not initially aware of the fact, this testimony might prove very damaging to selective members of the city's police department. Willis plays aging detective Jack Mosley who has a serious drinking problem. Mosley is assigned the task of transporting the important witness across town. Rapper Mos Def plays a petty criminal, who also happens to be the key witness in the case. David Morse portrays a high ranking police officer, who is intricately involved in what transpires on the courthouse journey and who also happens to be Mosleys'former partner. All three actors give high level performances boosting the overall quality of the film.A couple of events, which transpire on the courthouse trip, are somewhat unrealistic, but most are suspenseful and a few create some edge-of-your-seat type excitement. The most significant event that occurs on the journey, is the relationship that develops between the shop worn detective and the slightly undesirable witness that he is escorting. The building of that relationship is what the film is really about. I believe and IMDb rating of between 5 and 8 would be fitting for this absorbing action drama. I personally gave it a 7 out of 10 and would recommend it for Bruce Willis fans and for all action movie enthusiasts unless they have an aversion to story-lines involving police corruption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Donner was at the top of his game in the 1970s and 80s, creating classics like The Omen, Superman, Ladyhawke and the original Lethal Weapon. But since then, his creative output has gone into decline. The Lethal Weapon series is a mere shadow of what it once was, and his subsequent films are running on empty. 16 Blocks is a partial return to form for Donner. Granted the film suffers from a few flaws, but it's an enjoyably twisty affair, and it has a bit more zest than Donner's other films of late.In a part Bruce Willis could play in his sleep, he is NYPD cop Jack Mosley. A burned out, drunken shell of a man, instead of collaring criminals, he spends his time staying out of trouble. All the important jobs are passed over him, and he gets the assignments nobody else wants.In this case, he is assigned the job of escorting Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), a fast talking informant to a courthouse 16 blocks away. He has to be there within two hours otherwise the Grand Jury will dismiss the case. The case being corrupt cops on the force. And they don't want Eddie to get there. Led by the ringleader Det Frank Nugent (David Morse), it becomes an escalating series of shootouts, chases, and crisis situations to prevent Jack and Eddie from making their deadline. And dead is the operative word!16 Blocks is a bit formulaic and it doesn't really stretch itself. But it is also an occasionally inventive endeavour, the pace moves at a gallop, and the acting from all concerned is excellent.Willis slides into the role of a world-weary cop with total ease. Nothing he hasn't done before of course but if the formula works I say go with it. And he brings subtle dimensions to Jack's character. Willis shows a talent for minimalist acting with the role that really impressed the hell out of me.His demeanour is expressed through creases on his forehead, the dull glaze in his eyes, and even his moustache seems to communicate his feelings. All things about him that are gradually revealed to us as the plot progresses.Mos Def plays a much trickier part. A jive-talking lowlife petty hood that holds the key to bringing down half the precinct. His performance didn't always ring true with me, and his helium voice grates more often than not, but he is also an oddly likable character. You sympathise with his situation, because of the information he has been saddled with. Something he never wanted in the first place. His ambition to start his own bakery was a bit hard to swallow though.For me, it's David Morse who's the scene stealer. I've seen him play nice guys in films before, and that's what he plays here. A wonderfully twisted nice guy. He never raises his voice. He always speaks in conversational tones, and is ever pleasant. This is what makes him an effective villain. The way he lulls you in. He wants to be your friend. He wants you to confide in him. And then shoot you the minute your back is turned.Morse's scenes with Willis are cracking. It could be argued they have greater chemistry than Willis does with Def. They have a long working relationship together, and there are times when they both seem regretful that it's come to this.The action scenes are handled capably by Donner, something he has long experience in. There is even a bus scene that looks like it wandered in from Speed. Jack makes some bad choices through the course of this film, and the bus is one of them. But the fact that he's so willing to surrender himself makes his final redemption in the last scenes more gratifying and believable.16 Blocks takes us down quite a few blind alleys. Too many really. Some like the ambulance switch are distracting to say the least, but when it gets it's plot twists right, 16 Blocks is an effective thriller. The ending is a mix of something shocking and something predictable, and it ladles on the sentiment a bit too heavily in the final act, but overall 16 Blocks delivers for the most part. It's talky nature sometimes reminded me of the excellent Collateral, even though it never reaches the overall sophistication of that film.But it's nice to see an action film that's a bit more character based in this day and age, and there's a couple of good songs on the end credits to hum along to as well. Not a bad way to spend an hour and a half, and one of Richard Donner's more rounded films in recent years.Good stuff!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis is becoming a specialist when it comes to tired cops with alcohol problems. He does it with humor and self irony and you find it impossible to dislike his characters altogether. "16 Blocks" is another example.It's not a great movie, but it's clever handicraft. You have no doubts about who are the good and the bad guys and the story is out of proportion. But there aren't any dead moments.Mos Def is making something special of his part as the convict who is supposed to be moved 16 blocks from his cell to the court. He's funny in an unusual way and you may think, believe it or not, that such a character can exist in real life. Which isn't common in movies of this kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In an age where the greats of old are seemed to be forced to make way for young, mostly incapable actors, it is refreshing to see an aged actor do what he does best.16 Blocks begins off on an intriguing note. Police have surrounded a bus, in which Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis) is sitting. He begins to talk: this is his story. We are thrown back a short distance when Jack is assigned a menial job. He has 118 minutes to transport Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), an important witness in police custody, to the nearby courthouse sixteen blocks away.The following minutes are slow and tedious, the perfect representation of Jacks life. He's old, appears to have no wife, and his favourite pastime is the consumption of alcohol. However, when Eddie is nearly killed, the movie starts picking up to a nicely balanced level. 16 Blocks is not an action-fest as much as it is a slightly emotional drama, of two men only trying to do the right thing.Def, Willis, and David Morse (Frank Nugent), are all wonderful actors, who, while individually are awesome, are able to bounce off each other, to create some highly solid acting. In an age where the greats of old are seemed to be forced to make way for young, mostly incapable actors, it is refreshing to see an aged actor do what he does best, and this is exactly what Bruce Willis does. Granted, his acting is not Oscar worthy, but his entreating style seeps into 16 Bocks.The only real problem, is the lack of any direction, it seems to have been done before, with no real change to the cop-thriller formula. Also, the basic story seems to lack credibility, but none of that seems to matter as 16 Blocks is a fun watch, especially when the tense scenes lack the use of any real music.So don't let your appeal for attractive teen actors cloud your vision of 16 Blocks: because for the price of seeing Def, Moore, and more importantly Willis at their best, is enough to make you move one extra block in your ticket selection, and spend 105 minutes enjoying what is a highly entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping and more twists than a pretzel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those of you looking for a clean pated and fit looking Bruce Willis can stop right here and forget it, he is made to look balding and paunchy for his role as Jack Moseley, an alcoholic cop who's weeks away from retirement.Mos Def the rapper was very true and irritating as the motormouthed wanna-be baker Eddie, who saw some dirty cops in action and now he's willing to talk about it in court...David Morse as the relentless crooked cop sporting a goatee and never without gum was very convincing - a far cry from his days in St Elsewhere as a noble doctor or his part in the CBS series "Taxi" where he was an ex-cop helping people anonymously.The DVD version of the movie has deleted scenes with director Richard (Superman 2, Lethal Weapon 4, etc.) Donner explaining why they were done and why they nevertheless ended up on the Cutting Room floor.But the alternative ending that Donner also commented on seemed more appropriate and triste than what was used publicly. I understand there was a similar approach with "Casablanca" - two ends, but they got special sets of test audiences and learned people wanted the version as we know it today! There was another version where Bogey and Bergman left ol' Viktor Laszlo and Claude Rains munching Sahara dust.16 Blocks (what Willis must travel from precinct to courthouse) has lots of action and lots of bullets plus just when you think you have the plot figured out, then the picture changes up on you - it's definitely worth the watch!! http://tinyurl.com/3464k/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold-blooded, neat thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I looked forward to that one for Bruce Willis is a bit like wine : the older the better. His performance as drunk cop is a perfect dirty version of his all-time hero McClane. And yes, he never ever looked that ugly. The aspirin-evergreen has changed to breath mints, receding hairline, mustache (ewwwww...) and he limps right from the beginning. And Willis is perfect for that role. His counterpart Mos Def acts fine enough for the "rapper in movies"-standards and does really well. Unfortunately....to be honest: his voice is horrible. He is squeaky and sometimes barely understandable. That's also why parts of the dialogue go down the drain. Too bad, because they are well-written (for an action flick). Not as witty and humorous as Donners legendary "Lethal Weapon" trilogy, but, hey, this is a much darker thriller. The story surely has some nice enough twists to keep the viewer glued to the screen. What makes this one better than the average (apart from Willis) is the excellent work of Richard Donner. He shows a formidable sense of timing and turns the script into a breath-taking roller-coaster ride. In his hands the premise of a confined (and heavily guarded) space to cross in a small time frame builds up a tension (bullets can fly any second...) that can walk over some plot holes without giving away the whole movie. The action itself is fine but has the problem of copying some of the genre's gems (like Eastwood's "The Gauntlet" that gets an almost explicit homage). Lucky enough that "16 Blocks" adds enough own ideas to avoid the term "copycat". One last huge pro for this movie is the bad guy. David Morse re-enacts (and improves)his part from "The Negotiator" and makes this the cold-blooded, dark cop thriller it is. His performance is worthy for "L.A. Confidential" and it can't get much dirtier than that. A++ for David Morse. To wrap this up: a good actioner that tops most of the 2006 big screen blockbuster productions. Definitely worth its while and the better part of 7 out of 10 points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid thriller. Very good acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing you'll notice about 16 Blocks is how Bruce Willis looks. He looks TERRIBLE. That is by design, however, as he plays an aging, alcoholic detective who is regarded by his fellow officers as "someone we don't need". This is the type of character we'll be seeing more of from Willis as he's now getting too old to play the conventional hero. Though I have heard there's another Die Hard on the way. If his performance in 16 Blocks is any indication of where his career is headed, he should be fine.The story opens with Willis being asked to secure a crime scene after his fellow officers have just cleared it. He's asked wait in a tiny apartment filled with drugs and dead bodies until the uniformed officers arrive. As soon as Willis is alone, he locates a bottle of booze in the residence and starts pounding it down! You gotta love that! After his "work" at the crime scene is finished, he thinks he's headed home, but wait. He gets handed another assignment that figures to be a piece of cake. He is asked to drive a petty thief 16 blocks to a federal courthouse so he can testify before a grand jury. He has less than two hours to get him there before the jury's tenure is up, but it's only 16 blocks. How could he not make it? Of course, things do not go according to plans. The young thief, played to perfection by Mos Def, is high-strung and an extremely talkative individual. Riding three blocks with the guy at first would seem to be too much for anyone to take. The traffic between the jail and the courthouse in incredible, and of course Willis has to stop for another bottle of booze at a liquor store! As soon as he steps inside the store, things go straight to hell. Hit-men aligned with the corrupt cops our witness will be testifying against show up and try to kill him. Willis then finds himself in a spot where he is forced to defend this petty thief against numerous corrupt cops. David Morse plays the ringleader of this bunch, and he fully expects Willis to help them kill the witness. After all, Willis is just as corrupt as they are. There is just something about the young jive talker. Willis refuses to let his fellow officers harm him, and the film becomes a protracted chase picture from there.Willis is certainly outstanding as an aging cop with a heavy conscience who knows he has to do the right thing. Mos Def as the young thief is annoying at first until he begins to grow on you just like he does to Willis. He actually steals the film. Richard Donner keeps things moving, but never fast enough to let you forget this is a character study more than an action film. The New York streets are a main character of their own. How in the hell could anyone live comfortably in such a claustrophobic environment is beyond this author's understanding. But millions do, I suppose. The DVD has two endings, and I would have used a combination of the two, myself. Neither one quite gives you the payoff you think you're entitled to.It's difficult not to be reminded of Clint Eastwood's The Gauntlet when you watch 16 Blocks. We have a similar plot.... and even a scene with a bus!!!! 8 of 10 stars from the Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Crime Thriller with a Difference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This solid crime thriller has two things going for it and one thing going against it. One the plus side it has two different sort characters, on the negative side has one different sort of character. Bruce Willis plays an aging, alcohol ridden cop who is required to take a witness 16 blocks to testify against some crooked cops but encounters a lot of resistance along the way. Mos Def plays one of the most unusual characters in recent film, a character that is both puzzlingly repulsive but at the same time very real and authentic with a core of sincerity and honesty making Mos both a positive and negative element in the film. Bruce Willis' character is a lot different from his earlier action characters who walks with a limp and definitely looking and behaving over the hill.Unfortunately, the movie takes not take much advantage of the street smarts of Willis supposed character and his character almost becomes a stereotypical alcoholic cop (until the tie in at the very end). Overall, this is a decent movie suggestive of "The Gauntlet" (1977) and "The Negotiator" (1988). David Morse interestingly starred in the last movie and this movie. But it is Mos Def that really makes this movie stand out for both good and bad. Seven out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the better movies I never heard anything about!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had remembered sitting in the theater and seeing the ads for this movie thinking "Man, I haven't seen Bruce Willis in a movie in a long time, hope it's good". When it came out it must have come and gone really fast cause I never saw it advertised on TV or heard anyone even mention it. I just happened into Blockbuster yesterday and there it was on the shelf so I picked it up. It was a good movie. The story was good. The characters were good. The actors played well off each other. The guy who played Eddie had a really annoying voice but he was such a likable character that it didn't ruin the movie as I thought it might (didn't know if I could sit through a 2 hour movie and listen to it). This is one of those movies that had an alternate ending as well and actually both were good. As I said in my summary, this is one of the better movies I never heard anything about. Rent it, you won't be sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Detective Jack Moseley(Bruce Willis,looking literally sad and hungover)is about to be done with another long overnight shift at an unspecific(?) New York City burrough. More specifically,he's a whole four minutes close to getting off duty when his superior charges him with what is perceivably a "baby-sitting" job:transporting one Eddie Bunker(Mos Def,very good here) sixteen blocks(hence the title) from the precinct holding cell to the court house. Moseley protests but takes the job. On a stop at one of his favorite haunts--a liquor store,of course--Moseley discovers that his transport has a price on his head and that this job isn't going to be as easy as it once seemed.Thus begins this perilous journey that pits Det. Moseley and Eddie as the mice against the cats that are a group of dirty cops led by a very familiar presence:namely, the detective's former partner Det.Frank Nugent(David Morse). The chase ensues up,down and through various buildings in downtown New York City,with plenty of close calls and judgment calls that tempt the addled and weary Moseley to let go of his charge,who seems less like an ex-con and more like an unfortunate loser,caught in the crossfire of a war between cops.Director Richard Donner and writer Richard Wenk are able to craft an effective story that wends some familiar elements of crime,action caper films and they dial it down to be more of a dark,tension-packed character story. Willis is effective here,and Morse is professional as usual as a hulking,yet intelligent bad guy,but it's Mos Def who wins out here,pretty much inhabiting every element of the film that he's in,child-like and yet street smart. This film is too slow to be a real action fest,too jarring to be a pure drama,it is a hybrid of genres and a worthy one at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not A Typical Willis Cop Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not your typical Bruce Willis action movie. A flawed, heavy-drinking cop (Willis) reluctantly carts a rambling witness (Mos Def) from police custody to court. It's a mundane enough task until other cops start trying to kill the witness - and soon his badge-bearing escort - because the testimony stands to hurt the police department. From then on it's an urban adventure as the good guys try to outwit the bad guys to ensure the testimony can take place before it's too late.It's really too bad this movie wasn't a big theatrical success. It could be that audiences just weren't excited about seeing the 51-year-old Willis as a member of law enforcement for the umpteenth time. But while he is yet again a cop, our star (who looks like hell, but on purpose) certainly pulled off something different here. It's not perfect, but it is often smart and fun with interesting character interaction. Like so many Willis films before, there are even one or two instances where you'll ask yourself, "Okay, how does he get out of this one?" and struggle to come up with an answer - until that answer unfolds before your eyes. Def, a hip-hop artist off screen, can be annoying but is enjoyable enough as he races down streets, through hallways and on a bullet-riddled bus with Willis. And David Morse is positively hateful as the cop leading the charge against the two men. Another plus is that producers didn't pad out the film, letting it properly run at a tidy 95-or-so minutes.Both Willis and director Richard Donner (Superman, the Lethal Weapon series) have done much better, but they've also done much worse. Chalk up "16 Blocks" as a pretty good movie that deserved more attention than it ever received.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, let me start by saying that I dig Bruce Willis and really haven't found one of his films I didn't like. 16 Blocks was a fun movie to watch but there was really nothing new here.I know I am showing my age, but didn't Clint Eastwood already do this movie in 1977 when it was called The Gauntlet? Bruce Willis was pretty much the same character he played in the Die Hard series, (#4 is coming soon,) with a drinking problem. And while Mos Def was very fun, it sure seemed like he was just doing an impersonation of Flava Flav.Bottom line though... despite everything being ripped from somewhere else, right down to David Morse playing a baby-faced, you're-supposed-to-think-I'm-a-good-guy-but-I'm-really-a-bad-guy character, it was a fun flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A surprisingly good little thriller, 16 BLOCKS provides a tight, minimalist script, fine directing, excellent camera work, and standout performances by Bruce Willis, Mos Def, and David Morse. It is enough of a twist on the usual cop chase films to make it fresh, exciting, intelligent and touching.Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis) is an old drunk, a cop with NYPD who is given only minimal duties because everyone knows he has a problem (and why then aren't they doing something about it...?). He is assigned to escort a prisoner, petty criminal loquacious Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) from his cell to the courthouse 16 blocks away where he is to testify against some bad cops. Little does Mosley know it is a setup and very soon it is apparent that the bad cops headed by his old partner Frank (David Morse) are out to kill Eddie so that he can't testify against them. Jack and Eddie have a face-off in a bar where Jack has a conscience change and decides to go against his fellow bad cops and get Eddie to the courthouse. It is the getting there, involving hiding, running, commandeering a bus, etc that creates the bulk of the film.But as much as the action portion of the thriller is satisfying, the feature of this film is the extraordinary gradual development of change in the character of Jack and of Eddie as they both, as 'outsiders' doomed to careers that seem dead ends, interrelate, bond and change. Both Willis and Def give superb performances and the film is well worth watching to just see these fine actors in parts that give them room to demonstrate their considerable skills. Richard Donner paces his film well and there is not a dead moment in the movie. The cinematography by Glen MacPherson and the musical score by Klaus Badelt as well as the fine supporting cast make this a polished work. There is an alternate ending (originally shot to be the first choice ending!) that makes the film take a different slant, but the film as it stands is a fine one. Grady Harp</fullReview>

It takes a few minutes to adjust to seeing him as a worn out, alcholic cop however, once you do you realize what a great actor he is. Most of Willis's films don't show how great of an actor he can be. There is of course his co star Mos Def who does a fine job as well in his role. They work togeather well. The movie pretty much starts with action and it doesn't stop. There are many surprises throughout the movie that keep the suspense going.

A lot of predictable scenes and then a lot that were not. As soon as I was going to right this film off and give it like a 2-3 there is a twist. A good twist that will carry you through the duration.This movie might have gotten a 7 but Mos Def's voice (Don't know why they made him talk like that) was beyond irritating. And for those of you who have seen the movie know what I mean.

		<fullReview>NYC Detective Jack (Willis) is still in an alcoholic stupor when he is told to take a witness (Mos Def) to the Grand Jury which is 16 Blocks away. Problem is some other cops don't want this witness to testify because he will incriminate them. Oh, oh! Jack has his work cut out for him.This is a slow movie, but the pace is not deadening as it still keeps your interest. Not much violence and that is a rarity these days. I guess Bruce Willis' role is somewhat a departure from what we saw from him in the past, and we are not sure what he will do so we stay glued. In any event he does a great job as do everyone else.I am not familiar with Mos Def and I did find his constant talking about nothing very annoying. He never shuts up, but I guess the talking served its purpose. No, I don't really believe that. He was downright annoying and if I were Jack listening to all this as I am trying to get him somewhere, I might have done something to shut him up. Duct Tape comes to mind. Yes, it was that annoying. I am still annoyed hours after watching the movie. I didn't look at this annoyance as comic relief, I looked at it as most annoying. The director could have done something else.They were only going 16 blocks so car chases were out, but there are some interesting scenes with a NYC bus.No love interest for Willis so no sex and no nudity. Very little language as there were some GDIs and a couple F bombs. Got to have them, you know.Overall, pretty good entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a real surprise for me. I had never even heard of it till I stumbled upon it here at IMDb. I was not expecting much, but felt it engage me from the first few moments.The plot - Bruce Willis (Frank) plays an ageing, dishevelled cop. At the end of a night shift he is asked to take an imprisoned witness, Moss Deff (Eddie}, to the court house 16 blocks away. They run into trouble quick, as the jury's tenure ends in 2 hours and people do not want him to make it. It sounds simple and standard, but it twists and turns, changing it's direction enough to be different. Willis plays a drunk, ageing cop, so this is not an all action shoot-em up. It plays out the story and glimpses in to the case and their histories through dialogue. There is action too though.The Acting - Both Willis and Deff put in excellent performances. They have a real development in their relationship as the movie goes on you can feel. They grow on each other as much as on you during as the movie goes on. All the other cast members are great, but over-shadowed by the brilliance of Deff and Willis together.I have heard some describe this movie as slow moving, but I do not understand what they mean. Were they looking for two hours of Willis a-la Die Hard shooting match? This movie has a real story to tell and it uses dialogue, something sorely missed in movies these days, to play it out. An excellent film and a worthy addition to any DVD collection. A good film to watch with friends.</fullReview>

Lets try that again?.In Bruce Willis' latest film he plays Detective Joe Hallenbeck who is teamed with Jimmy Dix and ex-football star where they have to stop the assassination of a dirty Senator?wait still not right. Oh I got?In Bruce Willis's latest film he plays Officer Jack Mosley who is responsible for taking Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), 16 Blocks (I couldn't guess the distance that they had to travel) to the court house so he can testify against some dirty cops.The movie opens up by showing how Jack Mosley is a down on his luck drunk officer who has been reduced to being everyone's bitch at the department. After working a long shift he is asked to perform the minimal task of taking Eddie Bunker 16 Blocks so he can testify against some dirty cops. But this minimal task isn't what it is all that it is cracked up to be. After stopping to get a quick drink, Jack is forced to be a cop again because Eddie is attacked by some individuals that are trying to stop him from getting to court. This scene really launches the movie because from this point forward it is non-stop action. The movie has some good twists including the ending. But I am not going to ruin the movie for you.Mos Def does an excellent job in this movie. More than likely when the script was brought to Mos the director asked him to come up with a unique voice that would really define his character. I am convinced that Mos decided to cross the lingual skills of Mike Tyson and Flavor Flav. At times his character become annoying because he talks non-stop throughout the film but overall I really enjoyed watching him on screen. Because of his roles in 16 Blocks and the Italian Job, Mos is starting to climb up my list of favorite actors.In true cheesy critic form I could use statements like "16 Blocks is a Heart Pounding Thriller", "Bruce Willis has done it again" or even something like "Some guy that you have never heard of gives it 5 stars" but this isn't that kind of review. Overall I really liked this movie. It was non-stop action from beginning to end and there are several moments that put you on the edge of your seat. I would recommend anyone who is looking for a film that will entertain them for 2 hours to spend the $8.50 to see it.The biggest problem with this film is that I yearned for another Die Hard movie after watching it. This film demonstrates that Bruce Willis is still a great actor. Right around the time that Striking Distance came out people were saying that Bruce Willis' career was over. Well about 30 films later he is still going strong. Bruce Willis' should get an award just for being able to overcome the role he had in Hudson Hawk or we can just thank Quentin Tarantino for making Plup Fiction and reviving the careers of Bruce Willis, John Travolta and pretty much launching the career of Samuel L. Jackson. But then again what do I know?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be suspenseful, thrilling, endearing, action packed and at times fun. Bruce Willis is great and once again delivers a superb performance and Mos Def(he should really think about changing his name if he plans to stay in acting) was surprisingly good. David Morse is an all around great actor but I have a hard time with him as a bad guy, although he does a good job, after seeing him in a movie like Green Mile him being a bad guy just doesn't quite fit for me. There were a few things that I found unbelievable but that is to be expected with Hollywood. The last thing is I think this movie could have had a better name. In my opinion this is a must see film, top notch work I would watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yesterday i was supposed to be having a quiet night in with the dog, my girlfriend was going to see Tristan and Isolde, a great film i saw last week! Forr some reason she couldn't get tickets so we decided to see Silent Hill however it didn't start for two hours so we asked what was on! We were keen to avoid Scary Movie 4 and Slither and having already seen ice age 2 we was left with 16 blocks and boy what a film!It was well paced and though like most films of this kind didn't shock was full of suspense Willis was once again awesome as he was in hostage, and the only flaw in his performance was the terrible moustache! The other parts were well played however there was a certain annoying accent that although adding a lot to a character also started to grate a little! This didn't detract from the overall value of a movie that kept me entertained. The major bonus was that the film was about rather contentious issues but did not let it become a purely politically correct movie in fact was much more - a very entertaining and engaging suspense thriller Quality!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I watched this movie not knowing what to expect. First glance seeing Bruce Willis as a weary cop you do make a double take to see its really him, and he pulls of the role of a weary, tired and distant cop very well. Eddie's voice can get somewhat annoying at points, but he pulls off the role well, though you do somewhat expect him to turn around out of character, and change into a different person - ala Usual Suspects! Still, a great film, certainly one to watch at any time. No real re-watch ability, there's nothing to miss, and everythings laid outright away! Loved the film though, and if you want something that contains messages, action, dirty cops and great acting by many involved, then certainly watch this film!!9 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this yesterday. I had not heard anything about this film, so went in open minded. The film has lots of great action, whilst still having a real human element and great twists. The story is set around the relationship of Willis and Mos Def characters, Willis being the washed up alcoholic cop and Mos Def as the criminal turned informant. The way that the day pans out and the growth in their relationship as the film develops is the central plot. Due to Mos Def character testifying against the police, they are trying to kill him, and therefore Willis is in the predicament of saving the kid or protecting his old partner and the police force. There are many great action scenes and the human elements of the film, brought my wife to tears. I would recommend this film to all. Miss at your peril!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay there are only seven basic plots and everything else is a variation of one or more of them and let's face it it WAS about fifty years ago that Van Heflin and Glenn Ford took that 3.10 to Yuma so who's gonna remember it now except the odd smart-ass like me. Putting that to one side this is an entertaining take on the plot and they reinforce the parallels in a reasonably subtle way; in 'Yuma' Van Heflin was a rancher (or some other ordinary occupation that meant he was unfamiliar with guns and/or violence and Glenn Ford's convict had a gang of professionals trying to spring him. This time around Bruce Willis IS familiar with gunplay given that he's a cop but the twisteroo is that he's burnt-out, worn-out and an alcoholic to boot and the professionals trying to prevent him taking criminal-turned-witness Mos Def to court are rogue cops, including Willis's own ex-partner and rather than spring Def their aim is to waste him and prevent him giving testimony that will take them all down. Like I said we've been here before but full marks to all hands for attempting to - and more or less succeeding in injecting a freshness into a jaded premise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>16 blocks was a surprisingly good movie There was a good storyline and it delivered throughout the movie. I definitely recommend anyone who likes Bruce Willis to watch this as it is a very entertaining movie. The watcher found out right from the beginning what was going on and you weren't left in the dark about any aspect of the movie. The actors portrayed the characters convincingly. The only downfall to the movie was that I wasn't to fused on knowing who the bad guys were straight away. It would have been better if you were left to depict who they were on your own, but I guess you don't see that in to many movies, being so upfront with the characters so that is a kind of good difference in this kind of movie. The title 16 blocks was very clever in that he had to take the witness 16 blocks to reach the courthouse, not realising that he would have so much trouble along the way. There are plenty of Bruce Willis famous one liners and his co-character (the witness) is amusing to. It is good to see that 2 totally different actors (and characters) can bounce off each other and actually make the movie believable. The movie theme to me was original to a point, that is I haven't seen a movie like this before so to me that is good, but I'm sure that there have been movies made similar to them. Thumbs up and I will be watching this movie again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you want your Bruce Willis-NYPD-drunk fix? Well you get it in 16 Blocks. This is Bruce Willis doing what he does best. He is the flawed everyman. He plays this role frequently and plays it well. What else do you get from this film? Mos Def. While I still find his name somewhat comical, his performance was excellent. The plot, in high concept form = detective must get witness 16 blocks in X amount of time to testify against a bunch of dirty cops. The film is typical action fare. Unbelievable events. Unnecessary explosions. That is what makes films like this great. They are a non-stop roller-coaster rides, pure escapist entertainment. Downtime is definitely what this film is lacking. There isn't a good point to leave the theatre. Director Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon franchise) is an expert when it comes to making a film like this. I feel he did an extraordinary job with this, considering that some of his past action efforts (LW4) felt rushed to production with phoned in performances. There was also a slight change to his usual visual stylings. There seemed to be a bit more of a gritty feel to this film, including a bit of hand-held work. If you like suspenseful action flicks this one is for you.Thursday Night Movie Club Rating: $7.00/8.00 "Mischief. Mayhem.

The accelerating pace through teeming traffic and ghost-gray laundry, tight shots in tight dark elevators, a squabble over which Chinese shirt to take as a disguise--masterly.

		<shortDescription>ignore the haters, this film is great entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>16 Blocks is way better than Bruce Willis's last film, Hostage. It's a very well done film in terms of direction, writing, camera work, and especially the acting of Bruce Willis and Mos Def. I really recommend this one to a fan of action and crime movies. There are a lot of twists and turns in the movie, which will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie. It's entertainment that Bruce Willis hasn't provided for a long time.Jack Moseley (Willis) has been working a long day, drinking on the job, no less, and he's about ready to just fall off the edge of sanity. His lieutenant comes to him with a quick, and seemingly relatively easy task: escort a witness 16 blocks to court by 10 a.m. so he can testify. Little do we know that there are people out there that want the witness (Mos Def) exterminated before he gets to court. The movie shows the aging Moseley go to any length to get the witness, Eddie, to the court on time to testify. What ensues is some pretty intense action sequences and the classic good guy versus bad guy battles.You'll notice that this movie is a blend of the movies Collateral, In The Line Of Fire, and Speed. You'll also be impressed with the great acting of the movie. Bruce Willis hasn't really come out with anything good in terms of acting for a bit, and he erases all doubt here. He is at his best when he actually isn't talking, because he says about 100 words in the whole movie. His facial expressions are excellent, reacting to each word of each line individually and with the most precise movements. His counterpart, the witness Eddie, played by Mos Def, turns in a great performance as well. Def changes his normally deep voice into a high pitched Truman Capote like voice for the film, and while you think you'll get annoyed by it, you don't. Mos Def is also funny when he needs to be, but is also great in the scenes that call for him to be serious. David Morse (The Negotiator) also delivers a good show as Jack's ex-partner and the movie's main villain, a man trying to stop Jack from revealing the truth about events from years earlier.There are a few turns and twists, but not one gigantic story turner. The one at the end (no spoilers here!) will be a little unexpected, but you won't be able to predict everything about the movie. The only thing that keeps it from getting the 10 (which I don't give out too often anymore) is that it is a tad bit predictable and there is one scene that is a bit unrealistic. But other than this, the direction is fantastic, and the writing is even better. Another thing that makes the sudden twists so good is the camera work, which gets an A+ from me.I wasn't really going to see 16 Blocks, but since V for Vendetta was sold out, I settled for this, and damn am I glad I did. 16 Blocks is great entertainment for any moviegoer, and especially the fans of Bruce Willis and Mos Def. Have a good time watching this one....I know I did! 9/10 --spy</fullReview>

Just when things start to get over the top, something happens to release the tension and lighten the mood. Dear God, someone was actually awake in scripting class.At first, I thought that Eddie's accent was going to kill it for me, but his lines are so well-written and delivered that his annoyance level drops from an eight to about a three in his first five minutes.</fullReview>

You go to see the signature of Bruce when you go, you expect his eyes to show you that he's going to take an impossible situation and make up a really f*cked up solution as he's verbally and mentally raping his assaulters.But the reason you go back to seeing him time and again is because he manages to make each character he portrays into something new every time. And it doesn't seem to matter to me that he's usually found playing a detective or a cop or some public protector with a whakt secret/home life or some thing like that tending to add to the character he portrays. Alright, so Mos Def is annoying at times but you gotta love that s.o.b., he was the same skinny endearing s.o.b. in 'The Woodsman' except here he's a little more voice impaired this time making him more endearing.I got into the film halfway through and still enjoyed it. Willis has several more films left in him that utilize the same character sorry to say. I like the whole Law and Order kinda tie in here where more than the local pigs get at each other. Testimonial witness is endangered minus the Harrison Ford schlepping along. Bruce is not too old to come over and kick your ass for not going to see this film, but I would sneak into a couple of others afterwards if you've ever seen Law and Order or any other of his films that are similar to this cop flick.This one gets a ten, too. That's right b*tch, a ten. Kill me for it. Maybe Bruce'll figure out a way to get me out of the situation, and Mos Def will bake me a cake after I survive your raid on me. You don't know anyone who bakes a cake simply for people who get shot at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many movies these days come up a few blocks short of that miracle mile. Be it casting, character development or the story in general, you're lucky if you are able to stretch your legs, let alone walk the dog.16 Block will go down as a classic. It's a well done movie that showcases the acting ability of underground raper Mos Def solidifies Bruce Willis' ability to do more than blow up buildings and shine the spotlight on a personal favorite of mine, David Morse (Bait, The Rock, Green Mile).The beauty of this movie is how things flow. You know the plot going in. A cop has to get a witness 16 block. The question then becomes Will he make it, how will he make it, who will survive the journey and whom will they meet along the way.This is a great movie and reveals a great deal about people and their ability to change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action-Packed Crime Thriller? Mos Def-initely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If NYC bus drivers drove their MTA buses with the dogged determination that Det. Jack Mosley (played by a paunchy Bruce Willis) displayed in this action/adventure/crime/drama/thriller, the folks at the NYC MTA Complaint Department would have little to do but punch IN and OUT on a daily basis. Mosley's reason for hi-jacking an MTA bus coincides with his desire to successfully escort a fast-talking witness, Eddie Bunker (played with sublime brilliance by Mos Def), from police custody to a courthouse. The title of the film is derived from the distance--"16 Blocks"--between the police precinct where Bunker has been held to the courthouse where he is due to testify.Relative to the plot: aging cop must escort witness 16 blocks, going into the film I had doubts that Director Richard Donner and Writer Richard Wenk would have enough skill to pull off an action-packed drama, let alone edge-of-your-seat thriller. But, giving credit where credit is due, they surpassed my expectations, and then some.Like Det. Mosley, "16 Blocks" delivers the goods.Of course, one does have to look the other way during some of the movie's sequences, especially the never-ending string of escapes that the gimpy detective and his ever-chatting custodial responsibility make in the course of their short trip. Believe it, Houdini would be impressed by these two if he were still around. Even after Mosley wedges the hi-jacked bus into an alleyway with no outlets they manage to elude their pursuers. But, as we all know by now, that is the nature of "thrillers." Most often the pursued are trapped in no-escape situations by slipping out the back door, or high-tailing it up a stairwell, or, as aforementioned, hi-jacking a city bus.Willis and Def, the two lead characters in the movie, carry the load, and do so with a combination of dead-pan humor, knowing exchanges, and sheer will.Playing the grizzled, alcoholic NYPD police detective, who is on the verge of retirement, or suicide (whichever comes first), Willis hits all the right marks. There's something in his face that plays perfectly to the tone of "been there, done that" without playing that tone as stereotypically jaded. That's not so surprising as Willis has shown his chops in a handful of previous flicks. What is surprising is Mos Def's performance as the inscrutable yet amiable Eddie Bunker.Def's character brings to mind the character played by Mel Gibson in "Conspiracy Theory" (produced by Mr. Donner). One moment you think the guy is full of hot air and fantasy, but in the next his obtuse ramblings make sense. Thanks to the believable relationship these two build in their short time together, Def gets to deliver several of the movie's most hilarious lines, made all the more poignant in light of Willis' response, or lack thereof.By movie's end, these strange bedfellows act in unison, achieving their individual goals by the only means left available to them. (I won't divulge their choice as it would give away too much of the ending.) Suffice it to say, this surprising movie succeeded as an action/adventure/crime/drama/thriller on the shoulders of its leading characters, and the talents of Donner and Wenk.Work to the wise. As one might be tempted to do upon meeting Det. Mosley, don't underestimate what you see at face value relative to the movie's seemingly skimpy plot.While "16 Blocks" might not seem enough distance for hold one's interest, escorted by Willis and Def, one's adventure is anything but uneventful.</fullReview>

This is not a put down. this is praise. very well made. good story. and NOT morally ambiguous, a phrase that I have learned to hate. Mos Def's performance is Oscar worthy. He's very funny and touching. Willis is excellent as the weary cop who sees his last chance to do something right. There are some problems. The minute David Morse comes on the screen, you know he is up to no good before he opens his mouth. And when Willis and Mos are on the bus, why doesn't Willis just call in the police negotiator and explain things to him. But if that happened there would not be a story because the movie would have to end then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>16 Blocks is a great cop thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"16 Blocks" was a very good movie, but there were some annoyances that severely took away from the movie-going experience. For one- and this has happened a lot to me- the sound and the music was very loud, but the dialogue was extremely soft, so soft that you had to strain to hear anything. And there were numerous people sitting there playing with their cell phones and talking, once a cell even went off. And a person two rows behind me was chunking loudly on their popcorn while talking. I mean really, you pay $8.50 to see a movie and you can't even hear the dialogue, and you hear people playing with cell phones. Jeesh! Aside from that, the movie itself was very well done, entertaining, intense, fast paced, and had some great characters. Bruce Willis was great as an overweight, alcohol-addicted, cop named Jack Mosley who is transporting witness Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) 16 blocks to testify against Jack's precinct after seeing them doing some nasty things. But now the entire NYPD wants Eddie dead, and Mosley is there to protect him.Mos Def does an excellent job as well, his nasal voice he made for the film made it hard to understand him though, but he sure was lovable. Director Richard Donner did a superb job with character development, making us care for Jack and Eddie despite their flaws. Something that was admirable as well was that the director kept the language to a minimum when he could've gone all out, and, while gritty, the violence is most of the time bloodless. Plus, believe it or not, there is even a message in this thriller; it's that bad people do change. Eddie repeats this to Jack throughout the movie, as Jack goes from drunken, depressed jerk to an unlikely hero. This is a very good movie that I think many people will enjoy.I give it 8 out of 10."16 Blocks" is rated PG-13 for violence, intense sequences of action, and some strong language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think 8 blocks should have been enough torture for anyone.The movie becomes pretty boring at a certain point. One of the reasons for this is the quite predictable storyline, which holds only a few surprises.I really hope that there won't be a sequel to this movie. I would be very careful if they would produce one and call it "32 blocks" ;-) A lot of people who have seen this movie might agree to this. Also some of the actors - who by the way acted way below their usual performance - did not play their roles very convincing, in my opinion. Talking about the actors... Mos Def really becomes annoying after a while.I personally would not want to watch this movie twice and I would certainly not walk more than 1 block to see this movie.

		<fullReview>I am a die hard Bruce Willis fan (no pun intended) and it certainly wasn't him or Mos Def that kept this movie from being spectacular. Bruce Willis gave a very good performance, despite the fact that his role closely represented the same character he played in "Sin City." Mos Def performed incredibly well. Certainly his best performance to date.The performances of both Bruce Willis and Mos Def are probably the only element that kept this movie from completely bombing. Any other cast and it would have been a flop (duh)."16 Blocks" is a great action movie if that's what your into. The way I like to put it however is it's a good "twist(s) on an already overdone and cliché story line." I would go into further detail but I wouldn't want to spoil it for all of you. With plenty of suspense there isn't a dull moment that I can remember. This movie is definitely worth seeing if you like Bruce Willis or Mos Def. If not, then save your 9 bucks and rent a movie instead. If you are a Bruce Willis fan then maybe its worth it. If you're only a Mos Def fan and don't like the Bruce man then maybe the matinée price would better suit your tastes.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Mosley is an aging cop who has degenerated himself to a dead beat work horse of the police department. Indulging in drinking, even when he's working, Mosley is a man cruising along the rock bottom of his life and work. One day at work, Mosely gets another routine and uneventful assignment - bring a witness, some petty crook named Eddie, to court by 10am. He's got 118 minutes to do it and only has to go 16 blocks. Simple? Sure, Mosley even stops to pick up a bottle of booze along the way there. But then... the unexpected starts to happen and Mosely must snap out of his delirium because this witness is wanted dead. And not just by anyone, by fellow cops.Film goers might be initially unimpressed with this film where Bruce Willis plays a "lone cop at the bottom of the barrel." He's done the cop role many many times - Die hard 'nuff said - and the cop with problems is also a re-run from Willis - Strking Distance &amp; Last Boy Scout. But don't let that get you down, this film is no way in the shadow of the mentioned films. Director Richard Donner directs the film with strong characterization while keeping the action exciting, but critically incidental to what the characters go through. A good example of this is the scene where Mosley realizes that he could very well be in deep sh*t as he just shot a guy who tried to kill his witness - a circling shot with dissolves whirls around Mosely who stands with jaw agape. No sound, the character is still, and really nothing obvious goes on in the frame, yet you still get the feeling that Mosely has: "holysh*t, I just shot that guy." You can tell that he pulled out his gun and fired like he was trained, but that critical realization afterward propels the film as much into the mind of Mosley and Eddie (who is also shocked here) as it propels into the street of lower Manhattan.Donner also chooses his settings carefully with key scenes taking place in basements and at Mosely apartment - not just in some random alleyway. The films takes leaps and dives throughout all of its settings like Mosely and Eddie do within themselves and this subtle touch is very effective. It shows how wild of ride it is for them, how low they have been driven by what they did or what has happened to them, and how close to home it may hit in the end. That makes this one of Bruce Willis's best performances. While not as high-octane as his many previous efforts, this film is clearly not meant to be, and that doesn't at all detract from the film's entertainment.And it is not just Willis giving a fine performance. David Morse gives a typically strong supporting role, but mention must be made of Mos Def. There have been plenty of action films with rappers and hip-hop stars, even two in late 2005, and a film goer can only be skeptical with Mos Def playing opposite Willis. But, in a pleasant surprise, Mos Def actually plays his part not just for the cool. In fact, he is kind of an annoying brat that you'd like to smack over the head. Especially if you're a cop trying to get him to court and bullets are flying at you. This refreshing approach breathes a sort of life into the movie and the film moves even farther from "goofy action movie" category. And don't get me wrong, I love goofy action movies - The Last Boy Scout is one of my all time favorites and so are Donner's Lethal Weapon films - but enough is enough and it is a real breath of fresh air to see a great action director, an action star, and a rapper (or hip hop guy, I am not good at distinguishing that sort of thing) deliver a film that is good both dramatically and action-wise. 8/10Rated PG-13: violence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Def's Subtle Homage Adds Hidden Depths to Well-Paced Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK: I guess the history of film's "dark ages" literally is so little remembered that Mos Def's subtle homage in 16 BLOCKS just flies over the heads of the mostly deaf (to history) critics, both professional and amateur. "Irritating", "annoying", and "aggravating" are the adjectives most often used to describe Mos Def's performance as Eddie in Richard Donner's latest film: a well-paced urban cop thriller which takes ordinary action-film clichés and raises them to about the pinnacle of their potential (while still remaining clichés).A handful of the professional critics noted the similarity of Def's performance to those of the stereotyped cringing menials presented by actors such as Stepin Fetchit in Hollywood films of the 1930s. But these critics make this connection almost invariably in a disapproving, condescending tone.No one, it seems, gets it (or perhaps a few I have not read, but many, at least fail to recognize the significance of what Def has attempted-- and I believe successfully-- to do). Watch him in the film: how he walks, how he talks, his "irritating" voice: Mos Def IS Stepin Fetchit. It is a very special kind of homage.In interviews over the years, Mos Def has time and again spoken about the African-American actors from those long-ago, racist years of Hollywood's early sound era. He is fully aware of the shoulders he stands on, and of the legacy he has inherited (from Fetchit to Bill "Bojangles" Robinson to Hattie McDaniel, Dooley Wilson, Juano Hernandez, Leigh Whipper, Dorothy Daindridge, Sidney Poitier. through to the success stories of today-- Lou Gosset Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Cuba Gooding Jr., Denzel Washington, Hallie Berry, Morgan Freeman, Jamie Foxx, and so many more). So his Eddie in 16 BLOCKS is played as though Stepin Fetchit in his prime were somehow transported into the 21st century and given a role commensurate to his talents. "Look!" Def seems to be saying. "See what this guy COULD have done!" It is Def's subtle homage to the great Styepin Fetchit (Hollywood's first black "star"-- for what it was worth at the time) adds hidden depths to 16 BLOCKS, and it compliments Bruce Willis' affecting performance quite impressively.See the other reviews for more specific details about the film. But in the end, remember: Mos Def's "irritating", "annoying", and "aggravating" performance is a very special kind of tribute, and it works!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruce Willis keeps getting better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still believe that Bruce Willis is one of moviedom's most under-appreciated actors. Yes, he works a lot and makes millions doing it, but as he moves through his career, he just gets more impressive in his performances. I thought his work in Hostage was magnificent but here he's even better, especially early on the film, when he's tired and sore; at the start of 16 Blocks, Willis--who's portrayed some of the most macho characters in films over the last 15 or so years--is almost unrecognizable. He's old, all of a sudden, and got this little pot belly that probably came from his character's heavy drinking. But it's not just the make-up job and a (I assume) prosthetic gut, but his entire demeanor. At one point, when another character asks him an annoying riddle, he snaps, "Life's too long and you make it seem even longer." It's the perfect mantra for his character, and we believe it--that the character is done living and can't wait for it all to end--because of Willis' performance. The rest of the film is an amazing ride, sort of Die Hard meets The Odyssey. The plot simple: Willis's character, Jack Mosley, the tired cop even more tired after a night's work sitting in an apartment where some drug dealers have been killed and waiting with the stiffs until the medical examiner can get there, has one more chore to take care of before he can knock off and go home--most likely to drink himself to sleep. His job: transport a witness, Eddie Bunker (Mos Def, in an amazing performance) 16 blocks from the jail cell where he's been held to the courthouse where the witness is to testify before a grand jury probe of a crooked cop. There's a deadline (of course there's a deadline); Willis has to get him there in less than two hours. The simple transport job gets more complicated when it turns out that people want the witness dead before he can testify--and those people are cops, led by Mosely's former partner, Frank Nugent (David Morse, who--as he always does--turns in a riveting performance that's marvelously restrained). The scriptwriter, Richard Wenk, really knows how to structure an effective film as, once the chase begins, the film doesn't let up until nearly the end: time after time, you wonder: how's he going to get out of this? Okay, he miraculously got out of that last mess, but he can't possibly get out of this mess, can he? The only reason I give this film a nine instead of a ten is because there is one moment, late in the film, when the film uses a kind of tired trick on the audience; in case you're not as cynical as I am, I won't reveal what that moment is--but you'll recognize it just as soon as the moment begins to unfold. Sitting in the theater, I recognized exactly what was going on as it was going on and I felt annoyed more than anxious for Mosley and Bunker. That may be a small quibble, but it's enough to keep this film from earning the perfect score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Story/Plot - Jack Mosley (Willis) has passed his prime and isn't getting much younger or fitter. He is given the assignment of transporting a trumped up fast talking criminal from his police cell to the court house. The court is only 16 blocks away, a short distance for some but for this journey it becomes a suicide mission when Mosley discovers that the criminal is testifying against his colleagues in the force.Mosley is now aware that the whole of the police department want this criminal dead. Will Mosley be loyal to his colleagues or will he go out of his way to protect the criminal. Never has 16 blocks seemed so far.My verdict - A very enjoyably, fast paced film, exploring the world of what a cop would do when faced with protecting a criminal who is due to testify against his colleagues. The story line has you on edge with the adventure that is being portrayed. There is no lack of action and the adrenaline just keeps on pumping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Mosley, a burnt-out detective, is assigned the unenviable task of transporting a fast- talking convict from jail to a courthouse 16 blocks away. However, along the way he learns that the man is supposed to testify against Mosley's colleagues, and the entire NYPD wants him dead. Mosley must choose between loyalty to his colleagues and protecting the witness, and never has such a short distance seemed so long...The thought of Richard Donner returning to the big screen to make an action film he could do in his sleep is appealing, but the fact that it stars Willis, makes this almost unmissable.It's a simple set up, Willis has to get Mos Def to the court before a certain time, with all the cops after Def, wanting to kill him.It should have been up there with Die Hard and Lethal weapon, but it turns out to be entertaining, but very slow in places.Willis is great as Jack, a man carrying the whole world on his shoulders, here's a man who ha s a chance of redemption, and that is in the form of Bunker, who has to be the most annoying character of 2006.When you start to sympathise with Morses character, things are not looking good. There was on point where I felt empathy toward Bunker, when we first meet Morses character in the bar, but soon after he became Ruby Rhod irritating.But it's a fun movie, the director is back on form after Timeline, and the bad guys are your typical ones from the eighties.Don't expect the earth, just be prepared for a good thriller, with a good performance from Willis, and you'll enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willis, Def make great team in Donner's slick crime thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally published on March 1, 2006:Bruce Willis does his best Sylvester Stallone "Copland" impersonation as an alcoholic, out-of- shape, burnt-out New York City police detective who's tired of living in Richard Donner's entertaining thriller, "16 Blocks." Willis is Jack Mosley, limping, looking haggard and hung over as he is called to babysit a couple of corpses that were formerly drug dealers. After that all night duty, he is ordered by his lieutenant to pick up a prisoner in the city jail and transport him to the federal courthouse.He doesn't want to do it, but the guy has to testify in front of a grand jury before 10 a.m. So the plot is set up which has more twists and turns than Lombard Street. According to his superior officer, the distance he and the prisoner have to travel is just 16 blocks, hence the title.The con is Eddie Bunker (Mos Def, "Dave Chappelle's Block Party"), a bumbling, stumbling idiot who sounds like a cross between Jerry Lewis and Daman Wayans homeless wino character on "In Living Color." Everything goes fine until Mosley stops to buy some booze at a local liquor store. As thugs try to knock Eddie off, though, he comes out of his alcohol-soaked stupor long enough to kill one and escape with his prisoner from another.After ducking into a bar, Jack finds out Eddie was to testify against some very crooked cops, including Lt. Frank Nugent (David Morse, "Green Mile"), Jack's partner for 20 years. When Nugent threatens to frame and then kill Eddie, something awakens deep inside and Jack realizes he cannot allow this to happen.He then shoots one of the officers and escapes. Now on the run, he and Eddie must fight a battalion of dirty cops and make it to the courthouse before the jury is excused at 10 a.m.The plot then takes us through several New York City locations, including Chinatown, as well as a series of close escapes by the two protagonists. As they flee, Eddie gabs on and on about his dream to open a bakery in Seattle (specializing in birthday cakes). Jack, moody and depressed, just listens without saying much of anything.The chemistry between Willis and Mos Def is very good. It's a bit annoying with the rapper chattering on constantly, but his irritation begins to charm the hard-boiled officer who complains early in the film that life lasts "too long," but by the time they part, he has a true fondness for the young man. This is not surprising, though, since Donner helmed the ultimate cop/buddy/grudging-respect film series, "Lethal Weapon." I was also as pleasantly surprised at Def's performance as I was last year by Andre Benjamin's work in "Four Brothers." It seems that some rappers CAN act. His stuttering vulnerability and sincere emotional effort was a true breakthrough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast paced thrilling cop film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't have much expectations from this film but was just looking for an entertaining thrilling action film, and this film does just that. The film starts off pretty slow then immediately gets better and is more engaging. The action in 16 blocks is fast paced and the story is intriguing enough with a couple of twists to keep you entertained. The film also throws in a few comedic elements between the dialogue of Jack Mosley (Willis), and Eddie (Def), such as conversation's about Eddie becoming a baker, an on-going joke involving a bus pick up, Eddie wanting to visit his sister in Seattle, and other things. The character development is pretty good in this. At first Jack doesn't like Eddie and is just quite doing his business then a few mis-encounters and accidents then they start forming a nice relationship. Bruce Willis was pretty good in this film, he was convincing as his character, same with Mos Def, he played his character well and stole the show. In my opinion, had someone else played the part of Eddie, the film wouldn't have been as great. Mos Def's voice and mannerisms alone was great. Though the film was somewhat predictable through the beginning to middle, yet surprising at the end. I enjoyed the end but was stunned how it ended (I didn't see that coming). Overall this film is great, and for those who haven't seen it, should check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Much better than I expected!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had not heard much about this film before I watched it. It had been lurking in my DVD collection for some time before I decided it was time it got an airing. I got it on a whim, you know, 'it's got Bruce Willis in it so it can't be that bad', kind of thing. And now I've watched it it's turned out to be a pretty good purchase. But I digress, here's a little about the plot before I tell you what I thought of it.Detective Jack Mosley is a broken down cop, he drinks and does as little as possible to get through each day. He's just finished a night shift when his Lieutenant persuades him to do one last job, get a felon from the precinct to the Courthouse. 16 blocks in two hours. Little does Jack know that this little job will uncover things certain people would rather kept quiet. The criminal is a young guy called Eddie Bunker who's wanted to testify before a Grand Jury. It's only when someone tries to kill him en route to the Courthouse that Jack discovers exactly what he knows. It seems Eddie has evidence of a senior officer taking bribes and a lot of other cops involved in the scheme are out to silence the witness. As you can imagine this makes things really tough for Jack. I think that's enough about the plot, don't want to give too much away.I found this a very thought provoking whist at the same time a very entertaining film. Well made with the streets of New York looking great as they always do. Great performances from the entire cast, in particular I liked the performance of Bruce Willis as Det. Jack Mosley. I thought Mos Def was really engaging as Eddie Bunker, although I did find his accent a little hard to follow at times. Also, David Morse stood out as the Mosley's ex-partner who is leading the pursuit and plays a really unpleasant bad guy.This is a film about redemption. The Jack Mosley character has given up because he has no purpose in life. During the film he finds a purpose and in the end does the right thing. It's one of the best performances I've seen from Bruce Willis in years, very understated and very poignant. Over all, as I've already said, I found the film both thought provoking and entertaining and as such I can also recommend it.My score: 7.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a story of a policeman Jack Mosely (Bruce Willis) who is nearing his service tenure and probably bored by his life and job. He keeps on drinking daily and on the job too, just to pass of his day. One day he is given a routine task of escorting a prisoner (Mos Def) from jail to the magistrate's office so the prisoner can record his testimony. Detective Jack Mosely later on comes to know that this prisoner is suppose to testify against many of the policemen who had done many bad things in the past. He decides to save the man and tries to make it to the magistrate's office in time, the detective risks his own life in the process, as the bad policemen are hell bent not to stop them from reaching the court.The movie has some good moves done by Bruce Willis and the bad men to outwit each other, which keeps you interested in the movie, but at the same time some scenes are too long and take the interest out of their move.Bruce Willis does a great job. Mos Def looks a perfect blend for an innocent looking prisoner who wishes to open a cake bakery one day. Mos Def voice is distinctly different, which suits his role.It's a movie which tries to showcase that if a person decides something he can achieve it, no matter how big the obstacle is. It is the person's determination and grit which helps him to achieve great things. The movie is good but the speed of the movie could have been better as it's a bit slow.http://moviesopinion.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pursue-mix-hostage situation. Although there is nothing visually stunning or anything special about this movie, it has sufficient good, clean action. Throughout the movie there is a slightly boring tone. But keeping in mind that it plays off in JUST sixteen blocks of the city, it really had me tensed up! Once the movie's opening arrested my attention, it didn't let go. The suspense is moderate but suiting and the film presents light humor throughout. I really liked it a lot. I was frequently surprised at the way it plays out towards the ending, and mostly loved it for its noticeable lack of cheese. For constant chase scenes, great dialog, realistic acting by Bruce Willis and the smoky atmosphere, I give '16 Blocks' thumbs up for being a satisfying pursuit film with a deeper message.If you liked this I would recommend The Fugitive, Hostage, Inside Man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie kept me glued to my seat even though I saw "Gaunlet" with Clint Eastwood many years ago. I think what held it together for me is that even though the story is basically the same, there are so many other elements that are so different this one held up as if it was unique.Bruce Willis does everything well - from Moonlighting to Fifth Element and this. Mos Def does a great job. David Morse knows his subtle expressions that made his character stand out. (Personally I think he should star in his own film. Alas, not being a producer...) And, of course, the streets of NYC are unique for their lack of space!The plot seemed thin to me. I think that's because the director decided not to build the characters of the movie - i.e. you had no history by which to believe them. Perhaps they both had to do with each other. Regardless, as I said above, the elements, all put together, made this movie stand out apart and on its own as a strong drama. 9/10.-LD______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Numerous twists and turns--even up to the end you wonder how it will all end.....good escapism and pure Willis in short. Sometimes "Eddie" was a bit difficult to understand...and the plot often thickened. Willis and Eddie were part Houdini--which after a while becomes unbelievable. How convenient that Willis' character knows so many people in the city and happens to be in the right place at the right time. Amazing, too, that someone with his physical limitations and inebriation can outwit so many cops who appear to be in top-notch condition - time and again . Again, though,it was fun in the Willis tradition and worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Donner's '16 Blocks' is an old fashioned film. Entertaining, though, if more than a little predictable. The cop and crim buddy movie has been a major staple of action/adventure for two decades, and this really has nothing new to say. Like most films of the genre the ride is more important than the destination, and director Donner, and actors Willis, Morse and Def make it an interesting journey.In yet another unflattering role, Willis is (unsurprisingly) at the heart of this film, and the interplay between his borderline-corrupt drunken cop and his slicker former partner, Morse (superb, as ever ? an actor who is finally getting the roles and credit he deserves) is genuinely engaging. Sadly Def's role is nowhere near as well drawn, and has few real chances for development. This is a shame, as it means we never fully engage with his character, and he becomes little more than a glorified plot device to focus our attention on the oft-iterated moral that people can change for the better if they really want to.As always, Donner uses the city excellently well. New York itself defines the distinctive physical character of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis) is a hard-bitten. hung-over cop who's developing a bit of an alcohol problem. On a day when he really didn't need it, he's asked to escort Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) a chatty, edgy petty thief, over to a court-house where he is due to testify. Along the way Jack behaves unprofessionally and stops to buy some booze- only for men with guns to start firing at his car. Fleeing from the violence, Jack and Eddie take refuge in a back alley bar, only for Jack's old colleague Frank Nugent (David Morse) and some other cops to track them down. Here Jack learns the truth- Eddie is due to testify against some crooked cops and Nugent and his pals can't have that. Jack does his duty and upholds the law- but at the expense of betraying the 'code of silence' and making enemies out of his fellow cops. This begins a wild chase across New York where everything comes out and shocking truths are exposed.Yay, a new Bruce Willis action movie hitting the big screen. But what's this? 12A? That can't be good. But although the low rating will tone the hard-core stuff down, and even be the deal killer for some, 16 Blocks comes to us from the directorial hand of Richard Donner, the 76 year old director of, amongst other things, the Lethal Weapon movies. The film has an old-fashioned look and feel to it through-out, which may cause further distancing to the younger audience who may be more used to the flashy, kinetic Matrix movies, but to those who can see past this, we have an enjoyable and at times surprising little movie on our hands here.Willis is on pretty good form, certainly not the best type of work he's done with the hard-bitten cop role, but, as others have noted, a role he could pull off in his sleep but maybe one he's just a little tired of playing. It's also a bit of a nag that we never learn the reason why he's so embittered, although I think we're meant to infer it has something to do with his wife. Def has the best character of the movie, a typically edgy, quipping but also unexpectedly endearing black sidekick who refreshingly doesn't spout tonnes of gratuitous foul language and give another negative stereotype of his culture. Morse is also a good lead villain, doing his typical stony-faced, low pitched act to good effect.Ultimately, this boils down to good old school entertainment from an old school hack, with a good sense of tension through-out, a few good action scenes like they had in the old days before The Matrix went and wire-feud everything as well as an unexpected sweet, sensitive ending that leaves you on a high note. A prime slice of old school fun. ****</fullReview>

I turned around and bought another ticket. I watched it again. It was as good the second time as it was the first time. Bruce Willis fits well into the role of an aging drunk cop, but the screen stealer is Mos Def. Not only does Def create a unique voice for his character,he also causes one to believe that it is his real voice. He plays a much different character than in the roles he has played in the past such as left ear from the Italian job. 16 Blocks has many twists and turns that each paste you to the edge of your seat.

		<fullReview>The basic plot has loser cop Bruce Willis trying to get Grand Jury witness Mos Def the 16 blocks from the lock up to the court house. Of course complications arise as hit men try to kill the witness, and the situation is revealed to be tied police corruption. The question is can cop Willis make it the 16 blocks in time? There is little that one can say critically about this movie. You either buy the premise or you don't. This is a movie that just jumps into action with a minimum of set up. We know the characters since they are more types than people, so we don't need to know much to get the ball rolling. If you can take the film as little more than a fast paced popcorn film, you're golden. If you want more than stereotypes then look elsewhere since this film will disappoint, because you'll have seen it all before (though to the movies credit the outcome is not always certain, which is nice.)

It sometimes touching ...) , the story is not very original but the movie itself is great . The way it's filmed , the action , the lines , everything is interesting . You live and you hope with the characters , will they make it ? Will they be on time ? Once the first gunshot is fired , you are a part of it . No time to go back . The rhythm is nervous , not annoying , no time-out . You don't have the time to look at your feet , to be bored , you're glued to the screen and amazed by some scenes that are really what action should be ! Plus , the music is great especially the theme we hear when Mosley has the blues . It sounds like the Martin Riggs' one , in fact but more moving with a guitar sound that let a tear in your eye . We feel like the 80's cinema is back , for a moment ... We miss it often , and it's good to see a movie which try to go back in time . A buddy movie , packed with action and some emotions , directed by a man who made people cry and laugh (Lethal Weapon , see what I mean ? :p) . Don't think , don't do anything but watch the movie . You won't regret it .( I don't :p)</fullReview>

Hype, first week sales, then no one went to see it. Why? Because no one appreciates great films these days.Everyone was caught up in the epic dramatic sequence that has dominated the screen as of late that no one has any appreciation for the classic, whodunit-action flick. A constant stream of gunfire and chases is what movie making thrived on for much of the 90's and that beautiful constant has been embraced totally with this movie.Critics comments aside, which as far as i can tell rated this movie as mediocre at best, need to realize that this is what films that entertain the masses look like. Between Mos Def's annoying but believable street-smart hustler to Bruce Willis's half drunken yet well-meaning anti-hero cop, this movie not only brings together the old and the new, this movie makes movie going worth the 12 dollars i paid. I need constant action, i need a clear goal for which the protagonist is striving.Go see this movie, rent it, buy it, whatever. You will very happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taught, with excellent dialog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was an excellent film, and it's good to see Richard Donner directing again. The dialog comes alive with excellent performances all over the place, specifically from Mos Def, who is steadily becoming one of Hollywood's most versatile performers. The message is good, and has a great ending, leaving you satisfied.The story unfolds, with layers slowly revealing themselves naturally, not forced. And the real story is the metamorphosis of the two leads, Willis and Mos Def. While they are not necessarily two savory characters, they do see that in themselves, and they have a positive effect on one another. Also amazing was Morse's performance. Long a reliable character actor, I think it's a shame that he hasn't had a chance to flex his talents as a lead yet. I hope that chance for him is around the corner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of Bruce Willis and I have greatly enjoyed Mos Def in the Italian Job and Hitchhiker's Guide. Even so I went into this movie with pretty low expectations. The previews didn't really grab me and the preliminary reviews were very mixed. I decided to give it a shot anyway and I'm glad I did.The two leads create believable performances in a pretty outlandish scenario. Bruce Willis' character is a washed up desk jockey who is drowning himself in booze. Mos Def is a street rat with dreams of better things for himself. His constant optimism is at first very irritating to Willis' morbidly cynical character, but eventually begins to rub off on him in subtle ways.David Morse gives an understated performance that makes his sinister motives that much more interesting.Overall this is not an instant classic but very watchable and entertaining with quality performances from Mos Def, Willis and Morse that make it very worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! This was actually a great movie! I was walking into the theater not really knowing what to expect, because I hadn't heard any reviews or previews for it, but it was excellent! Bruce Willis is pretty good in this movie as a down on his luck cop who is asked to take a witness 16 blocks to the courthouse to testify. Mos Def, who is absolutely fantastic in this film, plays s witness who hasn't exactly had a squeaky clean record. On his way to get Eddie (Mos Def) to testify, Jack (Bruce Willis) runs into some trouble with some crooked cops who want Eddie dead because he's going to testify against a few cops. Jack and Eddie are now running all around New York City trying to escape the cops who are now trying to kill both of them. Jack must get Eddie to the courthouse by 10AM, otherwise the trial is dismissed and the cops go free. It is a movie worth seeing in the theaters and worth buying! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Donner has finally made a 'good' movie. In a time when there is an abundance of garbage coming from Hollywood, in was refreshing to pay to see a contemporary thriller which wasn't an insult to my intelligence, told a plausible story in real time, &amp; had solid, believable characters. Bruce Willis gives a stoic, journeyman performance, ironically without having to do much on screen, Mos Def gives his character a sympathetic, human portrayal, while David Morse comes across as a genuinely menacing heavy, in a decided departure from his usual portrayals. Definitely a good date movie worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging Thriller Anchored By Tight Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"16 Blocks" overcomes a strained plot and wincible use of an obvious Toronto as a ludicrously pretend New York City to be an involving thriller. It's like "The Shield" crossed with "The Gauntlet" set in a fictional Manhattan.Our attention is kept rapt in the performances of an understated Bruce Willis and Mos Def. Compared to his flashy action roles in previous Richard Donner directed films, Willis's alcoholic, paunchy, gimpy cop is similar to Clint Eastwood in "In the Line of Fire", particularly when you can see him thinking on his feet, such as in a very engaging hostage sequence with its ironic reference to "Speed".Mos Def, who has been good in small roles in such dramas as "The Woodsman" to "Lackawanna Blues", makes his character an effective chameleon with a heart here instead of what could have potentially just been a bug-eyed comic motormouth. His two essential explications of the plot fulcrum, however, are difficult to discern.Even though we have seen some of these plot twists in other movies, the snappy editing and music help build up tension encased in a temporal and geographical countdown. Donner effectively keeps a quiet background to the exchanges between Def and Willis, as their relationship raises this from a conventional action movie, almost bringing it to the level of another corrupt cop morality tale about doing the right thing, "Training Day". David Morse has played a lot of villains lately, but he's snarkily silver-tongued here, even if his desperately calculated actions start straining credulity.I was relieved that there is no silly romantic side story, even as Jenna Stern gets a brief turn as an earthy paramedic.The over the credit songs nicely includes songs by artists who featured in the dialog.As someone who walks those alleged 16 blocks in Lower Manhattan frequently, the Toronto stand-ins were distractingly obvious, from the quaint awnings to non-diverse extras on the sidewalks to wide streets in front and alleys behind buildings. The number of bullets shot in this couple of hours is more than the NYPD probably fires in a year, let alone around civilians. I cannot imagine that Latino drug dealers leave around copies of The New York Times, but at least a careful production assistant did have some bus passengers reading a Chinese-language newspaper in Chinatown (though I don't think they usually carry around tape). A parking garage with elevator access in the old building 100 Centre Street was a laugh, let alone the lack of security in this building. I am particularly fed up with Hollywood movies that impose on NYC the sound of police helicopters as a dramatic device when that's an L.A. thing; in NYC helicopters are primarily heard at rush hours over the bus and tunnel exits. At least the interior production designs were nicely grungy, particularly in the recreated old tenements and subway station.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining 90 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, let me get this out of the way first - you've got to love Mos Def to qualify to see this movie, not so much love the man (although that won't hurt) but his voice....because you're going to hear a lot of it. This rapper was so low-key in "The Italian job" (the remake, off course) that you won't remember him as the expert on explosives. In 16 Blocks, he simply doesn't allow you to forget him for one second, with the rocket mouth routine that starts before you even see his face, but only his arms resting comfortably on the cell bars. It's a minor miracle that Bruce Willis' character doesn't shoot him at one point or another. So, if you can't stand Def's voice (which one critic describe, most unfairly, I hasten to add, as "making finger nails on blackboard sound like Kenny G") stay away from the movie at all cost, for the good of your own sanity. However, if you like his voice, you're going to love this movie. Done.This movie is not unlike "Assault on precinct 13", but is less somber. Both are about a cop who has a problem of some sort trying to protect a key witness from a group of fallen colleagues. 16B places its emphasis a little more on action, is lighter, but has its good share of tension. 16B's plot is simple ? over-the-hill cop Jack (Bruce Willis) escorting witness Eddie (said Def) through 16 blocks in Manhattan to make it in time to the court where a case of police brutality is on trial. We follow the duo in an exciting chase sequence through Chinatown, and then a short lookalike of "Speed". But the bus soon comes to a standstill and the movie makers lay on you a sequence from "The negotiator". Then you get some more of "Speed". The final twist is something that has been around probably from the time the first movie was made, and then used in every other movie that was ever made. And yet, while you've seen just about everything in this movie, they are so well put together that you are probably willing to be taken along for the ride.There are messages too for those who want them. One is the often-asked question of "does the end justify the mean"? And here we have resounding heroism of the Gary Cooper or James Stewart kind, and Bruce Willis is still one who can pull it off. The other is that no matter how bad a guy has been, he can change so give him a chance. I don't think I need to tell you who champions that one. And then the movie sends you home with just a touch of warm sentimentality and I'm sure you won't mind that either. After all, you've had good entertainment for 90 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But you can be smart every day.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caution, mild spoilers ahead:Bruce Willis plays Jack Mosley, a depressed, alcoholic cop who attempts to deliver a grand jury witness, Eddie Bunker(Mos Def) to the courthouse without both of them being killed. This film has a ridiculously implausible plot but quick dialogue such as the following exchange: Frank, pointing the gun at Jack; "You can't be lucky all the time." Eddie, pointing the gun at Frank's back; "But you can be smart every day." The film editing is sharp and viewer is misdirected as the suspense builds. In an ironic homage to "Speed", a bus full of passengers is held hostage but does not go very far. What seems like a week's worth of action is compressed into two hours as the two protagonists race to the courthouse before the grand jury is dismissed. Mos Def talks non-stop in a great role as the altruistic petty criminal. Bruce Willis is fine as the washed out cop who rises to the occasion to do the right thing. Lots of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>16 Blocks is a fine movie. On a technical level I'd give it an 8 out of 10. I do recommend that people see it, but it just send me. As a fan of Bruce Willis - and who isn't - I think he does a great job. In fact, Willis impresses me with a performance that is not a cookie cutter of his other work. That said, he is Bruce Willis, this is an action movie and he shoots people.What really makes the movie stand out is the purposeful setting of much of the action in small places. If Die-hard is the king of large setting public space action, this is the king of action in hallways, back alleys, and garages.I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, but it just didn't send me. That's why I give it a 6 and not an 8. Usually I look for a few thrills that send me over the top and I just didn't find that in 16 Blocks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action-thriller by Richard Donner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What worked: After the pile of flaming feces that was "Timeline" Richard Donner has stepped up to the plate again but this time stepping his game up and delivering arguably his best film since his "Lethal Weapon" series. The acting here is top-notch, Bruce Willis should get some credit for the amount of believability he brings as worn out, drunken cop (Jack Mosley) who is having a really long day and wants to rest, but before he can do that he has to take a witness (Eddie Bunker played by Mos Def) to court, 16 Blocks away in 2 hours but after an attempted murder of the witness fails. Jack's day goes completely awry as the people such as crooked cops who are willing to do anything to prevent Eddie from making it to court. Mos Def also shows he has screen presence as Eddie Bunker, he turns what most actors would have made an annoying character and turn him into a lovable yet questionable hustler. David Morse is great as usual as Frank Nugent, Jack old partner. The action scenes are completely character driven they are not there for sake of being there, rather the action scenes propel the story forward, and they are very tense yet realistic, An example is the bus scene, very tense.What didn't work: They are some small plot-holes here and there but they don't ruin the experience of the movie. And some scenes do need a certain level of disbelief but only a few scenes. And Jack's motive for doing what he was doing is isn't properly solved. But these are rather small and they do not detract from the overall experience of the movie.Overall: This is a great action thriller by Richard Donner, recommended 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In '16 Blocks' Bruce Willis plays Jack Mosley. He is a washed-up detective with an alcohol problem that does not care about much of anything. When he gets the assignment to transport Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), Jack thinks is just a cake walk assignment. What he finds is that his fellow officers want Eddie dead and are willing to take Jack out to do it. Jack must make a choice.This was a surprising good film. Willis does a great job portraying a burnt-out cop. However, I was really impressed with Mos Def. I did not know that guy could act. His character was annoying, but very well received.The best part of this movie was that is was not predictable. It does have a few surprises. I think David Morse (Frank Nugent) was not particularly convincing, particularly in the end. But beyond that, it was really good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story with some minor action...an entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Willis knows how to deliver. He's a screen presence to be reckoned with although I know many will argue his artistic merit, he always entertains me and I happen to think he is an incredible actor and has proved it many times in films like Twelve Monkey's, The Story of Us, In Country and I could go on. But of course he is best known for his action films which 16 Blocks at heart certainly is. Directed by action master Richard Donner himself. One of the big things with 16 Blocks is the interesting (and yes perhaps slightly predictable) story that keeps things flowing quickly. The action is a more subtle than a blow everything up outright action flick but it's still there.Bruce Willis plays a washed up, over the hill, alcoholic detective that no one really takes seriously. He's given crap jobs and swept under the rug as a nobody. But as Willis does masterfully you can't help but see that flash of brilliance, that smart cop buried underneath the emotional trauma. He's just great to watch and plays this role perfectly. He delivers one liners like no other actor can. Mos Def plays the prisoner that Willis has to escort across the city so he can testify against what turns out to be a group of corrupt cops who now want to kill him pitting Willis against an entire city of the men he works with. It turns out Mos Def has been acting for a long time and I can't say I've ever seen any of his films. He does a decent job and I think he's a great actor but MY GOD he now wins the title for the most annoying voice I have ever heard. For the first half of the movie I could barely understand what he was saying his voice is so whiny and high pitched. His character has several moments of real tension and emotion and he still pulls it off but the voice is so distracting. The chemistry that is so necessary for this movie between Willis and his character is decent but not quite as strong as I would have liked. They have a connection but it never gets quite as good as it should be. David Morse wins for giving the stand out performance of the film as Willis' former partner and lead adversary against him. Morse is brutal and cold, and calculating and he does an incredible job as the "bad guy." Morse is a veteran and him and Willis have good chemistry against each other but again you don't feel as much of a connection that you want to. These guys are supposed to be partners and best friends for the last twenty years and you don't quite get that from them. The only downside to this film is that lack of character intensity between the main players.16 Blocks is the ultimate cat and mouse movie with some terrific chase scenes, some intense driving scenes, and the final shots inside a crashed bus put you on the edge of your seat. The story is intriguing and the best part of the film is the extreme twist in the end. You never see it coming because for the most part the film is pretty run of the mill predictable but then you get hit with a really interesting twist. Willis' character is very emotional and fun to watch. This is definitely worth seeing for fans of Willis or Morse or just somebody who likes a good cop movie. One of the better ones in the theater right now. Worth seeing!! 7.5/10</fullReview>

The movie works. 16 Blocks left me satisfied on many levels. Mos Def's "performance" seemed completely absurd at first, but eventually won me over. Bruce Willis even managed to bring something fresh to the seemingly stereotypical burned out drunk cop character. Richard Donner still has it and should be praised for delivering a film that rejects the rampant cynicism of our time.

		<fullReview>16 Blocks is a smart action/thriller movie. The characters behave like "real people" would in such a situation. Even the villains behave believably. The action is well-staged. The suspense is high. It's not just a guy movies. Women will like it too.SPOILER ALERT: The body-count is low, and this is one of the things that helps with the believability. In many cop/action movies, there are so many people who die, that after a while, as a viewer, you get desensitized to the whole plot. In this movie, everything is real.The performances are strong. Bruce Willis plays the old, tired cop character he did so effectively in Sin City and some other movies. His character is so depressive that he's hard to watch at times. Mo Def plays an annoying small-time criminal, and is purposely annoying, though that character can get wearing too. David Morse is brilliant as the cool, level-headed bad cop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was my second time watching this about 3 years apart and I couldn't remember anything about it just who was in it, so yea its that easy to forget.Its about a guy being transported from jail to court by an officer. He is going before a jury to turn states evidence against a crooked cop, but the crooked police force obviously does'nt want him to make it there and Willis has to do all in his power to see that he does.Richard Donner is an amazing director and has done some of the best and most iconic films of the last few decades, but here he did little to please. The directing was rather boring and nothing stands out. All I can say is there was a lot of cat and mouse running around in this film. The writer is a nobody, Richard Wenk, oddly he wrote one of my all time favorite vampire movies though - 1986's Vamp. Here in 16 Blocks, he told a story that has basically been recycled a million times.Bruce Willis is always good, even in a bad movie hes good. He plays a drunk, bored with life detective here and does it well. David Morse once again teams up with Willis, this time as a crooked cop/ ex partner of Willis' character. Morse plays the same guy over and over in his films but he does play the part well. Mos Def plays the role of Eddie. Mos Def is a great actor in my opinion, he stands out and I love the way he talks, its unlike anything I have ever heard. Bruce Willis wanted Ludicrous for the part and I hate that no talent having P.O.S. and would not have liked this movie at all had the part went to him.It is definitely worth a watch if you like the cat and mouse type of action/ thrillers. It's another great role for Bruno fans and it's not too shabby. It is however Donner's worst that I have seen, or at least recall. I watch so many movies, it takes a lot to impress me and this one didn't do a heck of a lot for me so I give it a 3 star rating...</fullReview>

And that you have chosen the right of those twos that rule the world.

		<fullReview>In their own way the original Lethal Weapon trilogy is a masterpiece. At least for what it is. It is the ultimate cop-buddy story with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover becoming the characters everyone is compared to.After a period of under par movies Richard Donner came back with another cop movie. This time staring the other great of the 80s cop movies genre - Bruce Willis. But forget whatever you have seen - this Bruce Willis cop is rundown, limping on one leg and a veritable train wreck. All he has going for him are his street smarts and a bit of luck.His unwilling sidekick is wittingly and enticingly played by comedic genius of Mos Def (Eddie Murphy eat your heart out). The plot is brilliant in its simplicity - Eddie (Mos Def), a small time criminal, is to be transported by 10 AM to a court house placed 16 blocks from the precinct. Mosley (Bruce Willis) is the cop assigned to transport Eddie to his destination. Not more than a few blocks later it turns out this may yet be Mosley's hardest assignment yet... And in the meantime he will have to make penance for past sins...Smart, funny, intense and nicely played out this movie is really suggested to anyone who misses the 80s cop movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis, non-stop action, and New York streets - it's a formula that's worked before, and it works again, better than ever, in "Sixteen Blocks," a 2006 film that also stars Mos Def and David Morse. Willis plays a drunken, hungover cop trying to get a witness down to the Grand Jury, a mere 16 blocks away. Unfortunately, the witness is testifying against a bad cop, and the whole police force is out to get him. Dodging them makes sixteen blocks seem like a thousand.The three leads are terrific - Willis is Frank Mosley, about as used up as you can get, and he's wonderful as a sad man who sees his life as basically worthless. Hip-hop artist Mos Def is a natural - offbeat, funny, warm, and touching as Frank Bunker, a small-time crook with a nasal voice who wants to testify and get on with his new life; and David Morse, the kind doctor of "St. Elsewhere" is great as a desperate, mean as dirt cop.Richard Donner directs a good script at a brisk pace, but it's not just about buses crashing, it's about the characters, too; there's a slight twist at the end as well. Not that you'll be tempted to stop watching.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Even the watered-down, "Hollywood ending" version is better than most of the action movies is distribution, especially Willis' recent efforts.Mos Def gives one of those Oscar-overlooked performances. His character is unforgettable. Willis provides some interesting twists to the usual cliché "burned out cop". David Morse provides his usual flourish to the thankless "dirty cop" role."16 Blocks" grabs you by the throat and doesn't let up.I give the "alternate ending" version of "16 Blocks" a strong "8" and the theatrical release a weak "7".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the first 20 minutes are decent, then it falls apart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the start the movie plays against the stereotype for a Bruce Willis action movie. Instead of the invincible wise-cracking hero, he plays an old alcoholic burnt-out cop, who spends his time doing errands and paperwork for the real cops. In the early scenes Mos Def does a great portrayal of an annoying, mentally-challenged petty thief. Then, all of a sudden, it becomes a standard chase movie. Good guys run from bad guys, bad guys catch up, good guys make a lucky escape, lather, rinse, repeat.In between the running and escaping there are these strange and very dull scenes where they hide for a while. In some of them, Mos Def gives a rambling monologue while Bruce Willis grunts now and then. In others, David Morse gives a rambling monologue while Bruce Willis grunts now and then. They play contemplative theme music over these scenes.The solid beginning left me more disappointed than if the movie had been bad all the way through. The realism of the first 20 minutes just contrasts how contrived and formulaic the movie becomes.There are references to Willis's character's 20 years on the force before the movie, and they seemed a lot more interesting. Maybe if they had spent most of the movie on that, on what happened before, it would have been good. But the movie is called "16 Blocks", and that's what you get, a 110 minute slow-motion chase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruce Willis? I won't go! Ohhh, okay.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Willis' (Moonlighting) voice appeals to me as much as newspaper on the bottom of a budgie cage. Other than watching The Sixth Sense (twice), I've always preferred to not watch anything with him in it. Admittedly, it's my age - because I should probably know who Mos Def is but don't. Why did I bother going then? We were running out of movies to watch in this city. I put off, ignored, then agreed to go see it with a persistent movie buff.I liked this movie. Mos Def played a dense, not-very-bright criminal. Initially, I wondered what was up with the way his character talked. Then you got used to it. He portrayed a one dimensional guy very well. That's his character's world.Bruce Willis goes with the current trend (ie: The Matador) of NOT wearing makeup to hide aging. His haggard, alcoholic, biding time, waiting-to-retire character was believable. There are some obvious clichés that you see coming, hope that they're not coming, then you cringe. Yet the ending manages to tie up the story in an interesting way.It's a flaw - in suspending reality into the theatre, when you wonder why there's no other options? You start using logic and it takes some entertainment out of it. All in all, I enjoyed watching this movie. It was not a waste of $10.00 admission to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The reliable Richard Donner scores again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a lot of respect for Richard Donner. He's a solid cinematician. His "Inside Moves" is one of the finest dramas ever, his "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet" is one of the greatest 'Twilight Zones', and "Lethal Weapon" is a textbook example of action film-making. Add his highly underrated "Radio Flyer" to the roster and drop in "Superman", too. With my respect for his talent in place, I ventured into "16 Blocks" and came out satisfied."16 Blocks" is not some sort of revelation, but it is a solid, involving, even emotionally engaging action drama with an emphasis on characters. Bruce Willis is terrific as a weary cop who makes a decision that puts his life and the life of his charge, Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), in jeopardy. Willis must get Def to court so he can testify against a bunch of crooked cops. The head of the crooked cops is the great David Morse, a fabulous actor who first worked with Donner on "Inside moves" where he played a semi-crippled basketballer. In this exciting Donner vehicle, Morse is dynamite, and is almost as memorable as he was in "The Getaway" remake where he played the unforgettable Jim Deer.I found Mos Def's character annoying initially. His tinny voice and non-stop banter reminded me of Joe Pesci's character in "Lethal Weapon 3". Fortunately, because there is more to the film than first meets the eye, Def redeemed himself by the film's third act, quickly negating my reservations about him.As the film is rated PG-13, it is not overly brutal, but the action sequences are directed with the enormous confidence one expects of a seasoned director like Donner and it is handsomely lensed by Glen MacPherson.Willis, who is very comfortable in his skin these days, is a joy to watch, and knows just when to let his fellow cast members take centrestage.The director of the original 'Gilligan's Island' has added another entertaining big screen action drama to his proud resume.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis is back. But, this isn't your typical Bruce Willis film.Bruce Willis plays a tired cop, Jack Mosley. Now, he has played a drunk, new york cop, many times before. But who doesn't love it. Plus, this guy is different. He isn't your typical hero, rather than being a John Mclaine rip-off.Mos Def plays a fantastic, if not annoying, "bad" guy turned partner. The relationship Eddie Bunker develops with Jack Mosley is great (and often comical).The action in this movie is also interesting. It isn't your usual Bruce Willis runs into a room and blows everyone away.16 Blocks provides a fantastic story with great characters at every turn. The movie keeps you interested and isn't just an action movie. It is a smart thriller and an entertaining film.While it may not be an Oscar winner, its certainly the best film of 2006 so far.Oh, and its Yippe-Ki-Yay.Now lets do Die Hard 4!</fullReview>

It was a fairly standard formulaic action plot, and they made attempts to change some things around a little so it was not stale (take away a love interest, insert a sister ). The script was great, direction needed some work (sadly Richard Donner could have done better), and the actors kept me totally involved. I thought they didn't use Bruce Willis as well as they could have. Their was so much great writing for the other guy, and barely any material for Bruce WIllis. I would have liked their connection to be a little stronger. I ignored all of the lame typical stereotypes, like the alcoholic no good cop introduction. I admit, it had a lot of weaknesses, but the story was interesting and well-written, so I was thoroughly entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film very much. What intrigued me the most was Mos Def's character.Bruce Willis (who is getting very old, mind you) plays a burnt out cop who is hooked on drinking and has a pointless, boring life. Mos Def plays a frequently convicted criminal, who has plans of change even though no one believes him.Our story starts off like a mindless action movie, but turns into an emotional friendship between 2 men who are almost the complete opposite of each other. It takes the means of Bruce Willis wanting to do the right thing and Mos Def believing he can still do the right thing no matter how many wrongs he has done, to pull this movie through.Ed (Mos Def) has witnessed a crime pulled off by some dirty cops and is on his way from jail to the courthouse (the 16 Blocks) to testify. Obviously these cops (lead by David Morse, a great performance) can't let this happen. All Mr. Willis has to do (having previously been partners for about 20 years with Morse) is turn a blind eye. But not today.And so the movie takes off from there, the action scenes pretty good, not too hard to guess what's gonna happen, but there's a few surprises and twists. My only qualm is the slower scenes were too slow, especially the whole bus scene. But if you think rapper-turned-actors can't act, Mos Def will prove you wrong. A decent flick Mr. Willis, nothing definitely worth remembering after a few months, but a good one to get some popcorn with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruce Willes Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People Can Change.Veteran director Richard Donner (the first and best "Superman" and "Lethal Weapon") does an excellent job of moving things along in regards to the plot as well as crisply addressing the psychological, moral and social implications of his characters actions in the terrific "16 Blocks." And it helps tremendously to have Bruce Willis and Mos Def in the leading roles. Willis: gutted, disheveled, disgusted with life and his job as an NYC detective, Jack Mosley... swigging out of a 5th of Canadian Club at 8 AM, limping from an injured leg, looking and acting every bit as a man who has given up on life and waiting for retirement so he can put a bullet through his head. But there is a lot more going on in Jack's head and Willis is very much up to the task of giving him a truthful inner life that both grates on your nerves as well as touches your heart. Though hampered by a cartoon character voice, the excellent Mos Def gives small time crook Eddie Bunker emotional weight and depth. Eddie's motto? "People can change" ...a mantra that will resonate all through this film. Donner has tackled some weighty emotional and social issues here: redemption by way of the truth, save a life and that life becomes your responsibility...themes not usually associated with this type of police action picture. In fact"16 Blocks" reminds me very much of Sidney Lumet's sublime "The Verdict" in its juxtaposition of the casualties of basic human nature and its failings and the morality or lack thereof of Justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>16 Blocks is the kind of movie you can really only watch once and even at that you'll be correctly guessing what happens next as it goes through loads of familiar developments with a lot of unsubtle foreshadowing. I'm surprised that Richard Donner managed to make a film so tepid.The rapidly ageing Bruce Willis plays a downbeat, alcoholic cop who is talked into transporting a witness (most definitely Mos Def) to the courthouse to testify against dirty cops. Only those dirty cops make it very difficult for them to make this seemingly simple, short journey.Since the film runs 102 minutes and they have 118 minutes to get to the courthouse, it's not strictly in real time. But it did very much remind me of Phone Booth in terms of brisk pacing and bustling New York backdrop. A suspension of disbelief is seriously required as a few completely implausible things happen.I mean, how the hell do the dirty cops constantly manage to catch up with them. Do they have secret homing devices and teleport machines? Why did Willis not shoot any of them in the foot so they couldn't follow? Why didn't he identify himself properly on that bus full of complete moron passengers? Richard Donner has proved himself a master of action in the past but this PG-13 rated movie is just packed full of jittery, blurred, badly-lit, incomprehensible shoot-outs. A harder nature and bad guys that DID more evil instead of talking about already doing it would have made a better movie.Rent this. And completely forget about it the minute you switch the DVD player off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Escorting a Witness to the Courthouse-How Hard Can It Be?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Detective Jack Mosley" (Bruce Willis) is a burnt-out New York City cop who is given the simple assignment of picking up a witness in custody named "Eddie Bunker" (Yasiin Bey) and taking him to the courthouse which is just 16 blocks away. What neither of them realize is that the person Eddie is going to testify against is a high-ranking member within the police force who has no intention of allowing him to appear in court alive. Neither does Eddie realize how many other people might be affected by his testimony. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this scenario has been used several times in the past with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, although this particular picture certainly had its fair share of action, the overall plot became more unrealistic the further the story developed which greatly affected the film as a whole. To be sure, Bruce Willis turned in a fine performance and some of the action was quite intense, but the movie itself lacked the realism necessary for me to rate it any higher than I have. Slightly below average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess you can think of "16 Blocks" as "Midnight Run" played as a straight action movie. That kinda sounds like a joke, but it's a fairly accurate comparison. Except instead of buddy movie, it's beaten-down Bruce Willis and Mos Def racing against both clock and crooked cops. The action unfolds in bursts and the movie would probably feel a lot more generic were it not for the character study involved.To that end, it's pretty good. Willis (hard as I am on the guy) is great as a burnt-out cop with a conscience. There's no smirking his way through this movie. And Mos Def wrings surprising sympathy out of such a limited role. I can't say whether either one of them steals the movie, but both put in the effort. And the capacity for change is a theme we can all get behind.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Action, Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of those special occurrences that happens rarely. Yes, it's a Bruce Willis movie - and yes it's packed full of action/suspense - but what's unique about this film is the performances given by Willis, Def and especially David Morse. Willis is not his usual buff self with unearthly capabilities, but a real man with real problems. Mos Def plays the stereotypical five-time loser - BUT has a big heart and REAL motivation to change for the better. Every movie like this needs an audience captivating villain that makes everything gel - and gives the main characters credence in everything they do. David Morse is that man. David has been in several movies, but is rarely recognized for the influential roles he brings to life. There always a few actors in Hollywood that are key to successful films, but never see the light of day in regards to recognition. David Morse is one of those actors. He shines in this movie as the "bad cop". Everything he does in the movie is top notch. He really plays the role well - and makes you believe every moment. He's the catalyst that gives Willis' character credence.A great, intelligent film. I highly recommend it. The buddy relationship that forms between Def and Willis is special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruce Willis protects Yasiin Bey from David Morse and other cops</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"16 Blocks" (2006) is neo-noir fare on the lighter side. In this fanciful story, Bruce Willis, a reticent dirty cop who has been a partner to another very dirty cop, David Morse, and in fact part of a clique of dirty cops, is accidentally asked to transport a witness, the talkative Yasiin Bey, to a grand jury hearing 16 blocks away. But Bey is to be a witness against these very cops. Willis won't let Morse and others dispatch Bey to eternity. That's going too far for him. He's fed up with himself and his life and he can act with greater moral strength because he's fallen so low, into alcoholism as well. This leads to an action story in which it's Willis and Bey against Morse and his crew of cops, a pursuit in lower Manhattan through crowds, streets, and Chinatown.Bey provides a constant comic element as his buddy relationship with Willis grows and they discover what they have in common and not.This is a serious, but not too serious, and fun film at the same time. Willis and Morse fans will be well-rewarded by seeing it. It bears the stamp of Richard Donner, an experienced director of this kind of film and story mixture.</fullReview>

However, in the case of the story line, I was very wrong.This film starts off getting you to know Jack Mosley as an alcoholic Detective who doesn't have much time for the criminal he has to escort Eddie (Mos Def). However after a certain event the film really gets going and is very tense and exciting as Mosley tries to get Eddie to court within the ever decreasing deadline.The film still has plenty of action, just not as much as I personally expected. This wasn't a let down, just different to my expectations. The story for me was the main strong points of the film. Very unpredictable and went along a good pace.

		<shortDescription>16 Blocks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Donner and Bruce Willis joined forces for this exciting chase action cop drama about a boozing detective's (Willis) protection of a witness to police corruption (Mos Def, sensational), sought after by one of the corrupt cops (David Morse) and his plainclothes team all over 16 blocks of New York City. Taking place during a period of time as a day ("real time") unfolds, as Willis and Mos Def will have to avoid cops constantly in this cat and mouse as Morse and his guys are persistent but always outsmarted. Morse uses his influence within the force to convince his cop colleagues that Willis has gone off the deep end. Donner is a real pro at staging action within confined spaces, traffic, alleys, buildings of all shapes and sizes, and certainly captures this authentic feel of a chase within a crowded and busy city. Willis is on his game as a down-on-his-luck detective holding on to his integrity while Morse surrendered his own. Mos Def surprises due to his ability to show a flesh and blood character that is undeserved of his fate, likable and genuine, in his situation due to what he knows not for any serious type of criminal behavior. Morse just wants both men dead and will do whatever it takes to see that they don't make it out of the chase alive. I think this is criminally underrated and especially well made due to the way Donner follows the leads throughout the city with the dirty cops in intense pursuit. It presents a seemingly unsolvable problem for the heroes, so the fun of the film is showing how they could possibly escape Morse and his sorry bunch of no-good cops. The bus sequence is especially a highlight due to the complexity for which Bruce and Mos Def find themselves, as a busload of passengers and cops surrounding them presents quite a difficult dilemma. Willis' revelation regarding why he's so debilitated and weary adds a surprising wrinkle to the film as he has a shame that has motivated him to defend Mos Def and challenge Morse over his safety. Facing responsibility for your actions and owning up to past transgressions could be Willis' salvation, Mos Def's character serving as a factor in his rescue from the doldrums.</fullReview>

However, here the concept fails as the crew takes itself too seriously and overdoes virtually everything.The first thing that comes to mind is Willis' makeup. He looks like he's still wearing his Death Becomes Her makeup. He's just plain ugly, he looks way too old to still be holding a job and there is no strength hidden behind those features.Mos Def, who is also well cast, has dialogs pushed down his throat that must have made him wince. He can do so much better. Now he's just another whino. Very annoying.Overall, aside the casting and the idea for the movie, there is nothing to tell here. It's run-of-the-mill stuff and you have to squeeze out some enthusiasm to keep focused on the movie. Five minutes into the movie you know how it will end and not much later you know both the plot and the bad guys. With the uninspired execution the movie lands before properly taking off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought 16 Blocks was going to be one of those movies that would be a prime example of a Die Hard ripoff. But actually if you can get through the first ten minutes, the movie is a different kind of movie than Die Hard. The movie tackle themes such as police corruption, which is big these days apparently. The movie itself features plenty of action and shoot-em-up scenes and there are quite a few showdowns between Bruce Willis's character and the NYPD, which make things quite interesting.Richard Donner's film is about a washed-up, alcoholic NYPD detective named Jack Moseley who is given a simple task of escorting a witness sixteen blocks to a courthouse where a trial is taking place. But those sixteen blocks are the hardest blocks to walk because Jack has ex-partners who want the witness, a fast-taking dude named Eddie Bunker dead.Bruce Willis does a great job as the washed-up cop. Then again, he should because he played John McClane five times in the Die Hard installments. As for Mos Def, it might take some time to warm up to his character. He has such a grating voice, but his personality is quite sweet and I felt the bakery subplot to be touching. David Morse plays a good role as the corrupt cop always on Jack's tail.Overall, 16 Blocks is a highly entertaining action movie if one can forgive the action movie clichés and the annoying voice of Mos Def. The film breezes by in its rapid storytelling and there are a few moments of humor to be had. The film is expertly directed by Donner, who knows a thing or two about action movies. This film is not the Die Hard ripoff I was expecting. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

I can think of a half a dozen Clint Eastwood films alone that fit this description. Also, Bruce Willis in another actioner also seemed redundant. I am pleased to say that this film exceeded my expectations. Both Jack(Bruce Willis) and Eddie(Mos Def) have a shot at redemption in this film which made it worthwhile. Also, the action scenes, which seemed to throw everything except the kitchen sink at the viewer, were exhilarating. I for one was kept guessing right up until the end on how it would end. Even envisioning one or more of the principal characters being killed did not worry me as the selflessness of both Jack and Eddie had made any impending death noble. I watched the film on DVD which contained an alternate ending. This is well worth watching as it shows the director and writer's originally planned conclusion as well as a THIRD character's selfless shot at redemption. Some of the film's humour comes from the film sending up Donner and Willis's previous actioners. Overall, this DVD is worth renting if for nothing else but a look at the intended ending.</fullReview>

Bruce Willis does his best subdued, older, drunken McClaneisms to continue his dominance of the startled, off-kilter, reluctant hero he has learned to personify and demonstrates through many amazing intuitive expressions that always lends even the most crazy scenarios he is involved in a certain amount of realism in his big budget action awareness. His costar Mos Def has taken some slack in the acting department, some of it is justified, some is not. The ridiculously nasal intonations and rampant half thoughts chosen for his character do suggest some sort of past problems, but the delivery does tend to be taken advantage of in an actory sort of way and usually cannot help but detract from the intrigue. Mos Def deserves credit for separating himself from most rapper/actors in finding decent work throughout the years, and does deliver some fine nuances in his otherwise overdone take , but clearly Bruce Willis and underemployed David Morse anchor the intensely sketchy plot details, which eventually begins to loose ground, yielding to an exciting but borderline absurd climax (though definitely select theatrical release edition for 1st viewing epilogue's sake).</fullReview>

And Mos Def was great as the lovable annoying guy. That being said, I (obviously) wouldn't classify this movie as a must see. The story just wasn't there for me.

		<fullReview>The plot is similar to Die Hard 4.0; Bruce plays a cop who is assigned to make sure Eddie, a witness appears in court but bent cops stand in Bruce's way.I was surprised to find Bruce very endearing as the drunk cop who tries to fight for what he believes in, while Mos Def is very convincing as the convict who wants to change and make cakes for a living. I found Mos Def's voice very odd and towards the end sweet...The action sequences are mostly gun fights and will keep the average action fan watching.The best scene in the whole film is towards the beginning when Willis uses a shot gun underneath the counter to take out a cop. Unexpected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Toned down Bruce Willis action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Willis, Morse and Mos Def normally but they play off each other great in this one. I was pleasantly surprised after hearing some negative press about it.It doesn't take long for slacker detective Willis to find out that some bad dudes are after his prisoner. With only 16 blocks to go there are enough twists to keep you guessing whether he's going to make it. Is Mos Def the good hearted simpleton he tries to convince us he is? Truthfully, because it's set in the gridlocked streets of an urban US city, the action pace is sometimes not as quick as I might have liked. It reminded me a bit of Cellular (Chris Evans and Kim Basinger) played at half speed. I loved Cellular, so I only liked the slower 16 Blocks.Worth a watch to see Willis kicking butt without the Die Hard persona.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Mosley: tape recording, "This is Detective Jack Mosley, Shield number 227. I guess this will be my last will and testament. This is for Diane. Now, they're gonna come talk to you and they're gonna tell you things. But what they tell you isn't really what happen. So Diane, I think you should know what really happened. I was trying to do a good thing." All he wanted to do was go home and get a drink.But at 8:02 a.m., hungover NYPD detective Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis) is assigned a seemingly simple task. Petty criminal Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) is set to testify before a grand jury at 10:00 a.m. and needs to be taken from lock-up to the courthouse, 16 blocks away. It should take Jack 15 minutes to drop him off at the courthouse and get home.But when assassins try to take Eddie out, Jack realizes there's more to this assignment than he'd anticipated and he calls for backup. Homicide detective Frank Nugent (David Morse) and his team are first to arrive at the scene. Eddie suddenly goes pale. One of the detectives on Nugent's team is the man he is supposed to testify against. In an instant, Jack's quick trip downtown turns into the nightmare of a lifetime: the criminals that want Eddie dead are actually cops.16 Blocks is right up Richard Donner's alley, the helmer of the Lethal Weapon franchise so its no surprise that he nailed this film from the get-go. This time however, there's no buddy cops and psychopathic albino jack rabbits involved, its only a man and his prisoner against a hundred renegade NYPD cops. The man, Jack Mosely is portrayed by Bruce Willis, the everyman hero who is assigned a seemingly easy task that turns awry in a quick second, it is no doubt that Bruce has mastered the role of being a cop well with the success of the Die Hard saga and a couple of stand alone cop roles in some other films. The only thing that's different from his other cop roles is that he's not bald. Bald or not bald, he still kicks a$$.The prisoner, Eddie Bunker is portrayed by Mos Def, a surprising turn from the rapper but effective nonetheless. The plot is an amazing thrill ride with the perfect combination of action and suspense and a couple of mild comedy here and there. It is a tense ride from start to finish and you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so it comes straight from the movie, The Gauntlet. No matter ... different characters, new action, slightly different situation and even a slightly different plot (did I give anything away?). Hey, Bruce Willis is the broken down worthless cop, not Clint. This movie rocks. Great action flick. The actors exhibit real feelings (brought a tear to my eye). Not just your phony shoot em' up flick. Doesn't quite carry the action and drama of Bruce's Die Hard flicks, but this film does a better job of grabbing the heart. It has a great storyline. There were no empty time periods where I drifted away from the film. It pulled me in and held me there, right from the start. The intensity builds gradually and no, you won't predict all the twists even if you try. I was impressed. Bruce did a great job. Mos Def was superb. The relationship that develops between Bruce and Mos Def drives the film. Definitely no waste of time here. Thank you IMDb for helping me find it on TOP RENTALS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant acting by Willis, Mos Def and David Morse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Extraordinary casting combined with Richard Donner's expert direction elevate this thriller to must-see status. When we first see Bruce Willis, his hair a thinned out ash blond, wearing a weary matching mustache, his appearance rings false. Surely this can't be proper make-up for Willis in a 2006 film. But wait five minutes and you'll forget the surprising character design: this is another towering, convincing Bruce Willis performance. But there's more to come for film lovers who cherish the opportunity to see great actors impeccably directed. Along comes Mos Def as a wormy, can't-stop-talking seemingly mindless convict. Again, the character feels wrong at first, but morphs into something akin to Dustin Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy. Def affects a voice and manner of speech along with a physical bearing that are truly inspired and seamlessly realized. Finally, perhaps the single most underrated or underused actor working today: David Morse. He is so explosive, so powerful a villain, he seems to menace you in your seat. Morse always delivers. He should be ranked with Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins as our best character actors. See this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i bought this movie because i remember seeing trailers for it at the cinemas and was never able to actually go see it. i was not disappointed and definitely believe it was worth its money.basically Detective Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis) has to deliver a witness to the court case through 16 blocks of New York traffic. Jack didn't want the job but had to take it.the witnesses' name is Eddie Bunker, played by Mos Def, who does a really good job in this movie. Jack at first finds him extremely annoying at first but when his loyalties are questioned the two grow closer.this movie is quite entertaining in itself. Bruce Willis as always does a good job playing a cop. Mos Def is funny and brings good life to the character and the chemistry between him and Bruce are great. David Morse at Detective Frank Nugent as well does a good job.the plot is simple but made very entertaining by those three actors and some of the smaller characters. a great watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember the special relationship that existed between Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier in "The Defiant Ones?" We see a similarity there between "prisoner" Mos Def and the officer(Bruce Willis) who is assigned to bring him to the court house to testify against other police. Obviously, there are groups out there who don't want Mr. Def to be able to testify.Def is absolutely amazing in his role and I would not be surprised if he garners a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for it. His non-stop talking first annoys Willis but as the story unravels, it is almost a blessing in disguise.The film is action packed with a marvelous bus hostage situation which quickly resolves itself.David Morse is excellent as the partner of Willis who is willing to commit murder to protect other people. In fact, he also goes all the way regarding killing.Corrupt cops has always made for interesting movie going. This film is no exception.Willis is most engaging. At the beginning of the film he looks like an aging alcoholic cop. As the film progresses, his physical appearance seems to improve drastically even when he is shot in the hand. I guess you look better when you have redeeming qualities.</fullReview>

Yet people here loved it. Go figure.Anyway, 16 Blocks was an incredible movie. The story line, the acting, the plot development, etc., etc., etc. Bruce Willis played his character true to reality, as did every other actor. I did not have high expectations when I went into the theater, but was thoroughly please when I walked out. Anything short of an 8.0 average for 16 Blocks is a travesty.

He's more laid back, quiet and has a look on his face that is just appropriate for the character that he's portraying in this movie.I also loved Mos in this movie. His voice might very well be the most annoying thing you've heard in a long time, but I can promise you that as the movie wears on, him and his character will grow on you. By the time the ending credits roll, you will definitely have a smile on your face.One of the better movies that I've seen in quite some time. Check it out for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad cop, worse cop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, this is a Bruce Willis movie. That means he is the star, he does everything, he is the man, he saves everybody. However, the effects are not completely exaggerated, he doesn't play the energetic action hero anymore and, yes, he lets someone else do stuff (on his brilliant ideas, of course :) ).What this gets you is a believable cop movie, with the little problem that this should not happen in this day and age when instant communication is at the push of a button. That gave me the feeling that the film is a remade idea from an older movie and people here did point out The Gauntlet, a film that I didn't see or I just don't remember.There are some good actors here, including I would say rising star Mos Def, Bruce Willis (who's best effort is still Moonlighting if you ask me) and last but not least David Morse, who somehow got from the Prototype to be cast as a cop a lot. One could even recognize Conrad Pla in a very secondary role.The movie is neither too good nor too bad. It makes for good entertainment, but I wouldn't rate it above a TV movie.</fullReview>

Bruce Willis plays an alcoholic, overweight cop who has to escort a criminal (Mos Def) to a courthouse while being attacked by rogue cops. It's a conventional setup for a thriller, and with a little bit of ingenuity, it could have worked. However, Mos Def overdoes his irritating accent and the ending is simply ridiculous. Bruce Willis tries hard to make the material better than it deserves. The film works for about an hour before the dubious finale. This is watchable if you maintain low expectations.Overall 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epiphany under fire forces viewers to actually think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the better movies I've ever seen. My wife and I watched, transfixed, throughout this intense drama.Bruce Willis gives one of the best performances of his career, on a par with his role in "Pulp Fiction." He is absolutely believable as a cop trying to do the right thing despite overwhelming pressures and odds. The always impressive David Morse brings to his performance the steady professionalism he displayed in movie versions of Stephen King novels.Perhaps the biggest cast surprise for me was Mos Def in the role of "Eddie Bunker" who gained my substantial respect with a terrific job as co-star.Despite all that quality, the strongest asset of this film however, is the work of the writer, Richard Wenk. While watching, the viewer may become particularly aware of the power of this screenplay because of the subtle tributes to the late brilliant writer, actor and ex-con, the Mos Def character's namesake. It is hard not to think of Bunker's authorship, acting and presence that he lent to classics such as "Reservoir Dogs" and Dustin Hoffman's "Straight Time." There are riveting touches throughout, as graceful and gripping as the briefest flash of empathy that forces the viewer to think, to interpret, brought offhandedly in the person of a Transit cop.It's hard to recall another action movie that shares the authenticity of this work. Even while the characters evolve, the true core of this story is in its quietly drawing of the viewer into that process of evolution, the birth of epiphany under adversity. Even while one is watching carefully, that direction may only become fully apparent in the final scene.This writing is simply brilliant. It reminds one of the strongest works of Nicholas Roeg.</fullReview>

Bruce Willis plays an Alcoholic New York cop with one mission, do his job and go home the bottle. Different from his usual cop roles where he is the strong confident hero...Acting along Willis is Mos Def (more know for his rapping ability than acting) who showed me he could really act in the Drama "Something the Lord Made." Def plays the 'baddy' that Willis is trying to help from jail to a courthouse to testify against some crocked cops, but does come with one annoying voice though...

		<shortDescription>Solid and entertaining even if on a basic genre level ? could have been more exciting though and has a strange bit of voice-work from the usually reliable Def</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite having just worked a nightshift and having drunk his share during the night, weary and useless cop Jack Mosely is assigned the task of taking a witness up to the courthouse to testify if a trial. Unbeknownst to Mosely though, his constantly jabbering witness (and indeed to Eddie Bunker himself) is actually testifying against one of a group of corrupt cops. Not willing to allow his men to go down, Frank Nugent arranges for Bunker to be picked up on-route and killed. However, suddenly finding something within himself, Mosely protects Bunker and the two of them find themselves on the run, 16 blocks away from their destination but facing an army of cops willing to kill them both to protect the truth.Despite lukewarm reviews, I decided to go and try this film and found it reasonably enjoyable despite a host of problems and things that could have been done better. The basic plot set up a potentially tense race against time and I had hoped that it would manage to be consistently fast-paced and thrilling. Sadly the film didn't manage to achieve this because it seems to start and stop far too often to keep things moving and the quieter moments meant to develop character are a bit too cloying and clichéd to engage. The action also stalls here and there, mainly because it paints itself into corners far too often and then relies on unlikely jumps to get it back to where it was. It has enough forward motion to be entertaining though, but you do need to go into it not expecting too much because it doesn't deliver.The cast try to carry it but without a great deal of tension or characterisation they are not given that much help. Willis turns in a solid but unspectacular performance with a clichéd cop turn that is interesting in some regards but obvious in others. For some reason Mos Def has decided to turn in a convincing performance but to do it in a hilariously annoying voice ? a decision that is made worse by the script requiring him to say 50 words for every 1 that Willis says; his performance is pretty good but that voice was a big mistake and I'm not sure whose decision it was to do it. Morse is a good presence who does well even if his character does make a great deal of sense.Overall an average film that doesn't totally work or rise above the level of cliché but is quite entertaining nonetheless. The action is a bit stop/start and not as consistent as I would have liked but it works on a basic level, which is all I was looking for. The performances are solid enough (although Def's voice calls out for a dubbing) and Donner's direction is good enough if only he had stayed away from the cloying sentiment runs throughout and also passes for an ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Donner + Bruce Willis = high expectations. Although the story was intriguing, the script good and the photography nice, Mos Def's affectation killed it for me. His Mike Tyson-pitched, nasally whine was so distracting... no, so irritating, that the movie-starved bunch I was with was asking for Mos' character's demise from when his character was first introduced. Why didn't Bruce hit him? Oh, yeah, he was too street-worn and depressed. To make matters worse, for us anyway, it seemed like Mr. Def improvised story after story so that he could JUST KEEP TALKING. Ahhh! Now, in case the filmmakers read this, I'd like to know who's behind that choice. Mr. Donner? Or does Mos Def, who I think an excellent actor otherwise, have so much clout now that he can dictate this kind of decision for his character. Tell me, I wanna know. And Mos, for what it's worth, please don't do that again. You're way to good. Rating is a 4 out of 10 because of the whine. Without the whine, maybe a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Review: 16 Blocks (2006) Goes the Distance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Opens: March 3, 2006 -- Here is a police drama that's not too different from others like the "Die Hard Series" and "Lethal Weapon," but has a witty script, good timing from director Richard Donner, and a terrific role by David Morse as a corrupt cop.16 BLOCKSReviewed by Harvey S. Karten Warner Bros Grade: B+ Directed by: Richard Donner Written by: Richard Wenk Cast: Bruce Willis, Mos Def, David Morse Screened at: Warner Bros., NYC, 2/23/06People like other people who are good, but they love evil-doers who redeem themselves even more. A drunk turns into a president, a drug addict returns to acting in Hollywood movies. They're born again, and they have our sympathies. "16 Blocks," a police drama that some will compare to the "Die Hard" series, centers on an aging detective, bum leg, alcoholic, irresponsible, crooked, burned-out, a guy just trying to fill in his time before his pension takes over. Can such a fellow change: convert from a bad cop who joined a half dozen of his buddies on the force including his long-term partner in crimes of embezzlement and manslaughter and cover-ups, whose soul has been crushed, who knows he's done wrong? A man who would agree with psychologists who insist that therapy or otherwise, human nature at its core cannot be altered? "16 Blocks" deals with this issue that has concerned psychologists, social scientists, philosophers and theologians-- a riveting police drama which despite the usual plot thrusts of the genre is beautifully crafted by scripter Richard Wenk and directed with an unerring sense of timing by Richard Donner ("Lethal Weapon," "Kojak," "The Fugitive"). The story exudes palpable chemistry between a worn-out detective who has lost whatever spirit he had before he became a bad apple (his crimes and misdemeanors are barely specified) and a low-life thief who has spent half his life in jail and is scheduled to be a key witness at a grand jury hearing investigating wrongdoing within the NYPD.Mos Def, a versatile hip-hop artist turned thesp whose roles have included those of the bandleader in "Lackawanna Blues," a CIA head in an episode of "Cheppelle's Show," and a hostile parole officer assigned to a sex offender in "The Woodsman," turns in an adept performance as Eddie Bunker, a motor-mouth whose nasalized, attention-deficit chatter could have been taken from a recording of a hyperactive 10-year-old. As Eddie Bunker, he appears to have difficulty connecting with human beings, babbling stream-of-conscious phrases that he probably knows are not going over. Throughout the story, he insists that he "has an important appointment," which seems not to be in the court house, and regularly adds that his aim is to give up the life of a petty criminal to become a baker in Seattle. Detective Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis) is assigned to take him from the jailhouse to the court, just sixteen blocks away, unaware that the man's life is in danger of extinction from the barrels of cops who cannot let him testify. Jive-talking the detective from the back seat of a police van, he regains focus when shots rings out around him. Even the sleepy-eyed half-drunk Mosley becomes alert as though he had just taken a ten-hour nap and a shower. During the next two hours?from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. on a sweltering Manhattan day?the two are immersed in an adrenaline-pumping drama, the convict now realizing that the only man between him and a 32 caliber shell is the detective escorting him to the courthouse. During the chase, which takes place equally on foot and in vehicles, the two men plan actions that will lead them to safety, while a goon squad led by Detective Frank Nugent (David Morse) is in hot pursuit. During those 120 minutes, Jack, who is falsely thought to be using Eddie as a hostage, runs through Chinatown (a must for police dramas), smashes cars in the way of a bus that Jack has commandeered and is under fire, and best of all, goes through a series of dialogues with his partner, played with the requisite degree of restraint and witty repartee by Nugent. (Remember that in any good movie, the villain has the best lines.) Filmed largely in Toronto with a number of scenes in Manhattan, "16 Blocks" features a powerful performance particularly by David Morse as a fellow who has too much class to take Jack down when he has the opportunity, delegating that function to one of his flunkies. Morse, known to patrons of the indies for his emotionally dead role as John Booth, a drunk driver being sought for revenge after killing a little girl in "The Crossing Guard," raises his voice only once, relying instead on trying to convince Jack to do the wrong thing, i.e. to allow Nugent to execute the thief before he can show up at the grand jury. "16 Blocks" certainly does not have the resonance of such complex films as Paul Haggis's "Crash," which features Matt Dillon as racist officer Ryan, and Mos Def does not have the complexity of Haggis's Thandie Newton, but this is a smart, sophisticated police yarn that compels attention on its own measure.Rated PG-13. 99 minutes © 2006 by Harvey Karten Member: NY Film Critics Online</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main reason this movie could be said to stink is that it uses the same ideas as a thousand other movies that were made first. The thing is, though, that if I didn't know when those movies were made, I would think they were derivative of this one. It starts off simple, seeming like just another "deliver the MacGuffin against all odds," but--without introducing spoilers--suffice it to say that the hero finds himself in a deep conflict between what his inner self tells him is right and what would be oh so easy. Particular mention can be made of the perfectly cast villain, who acts as nothing less than a voice of reason, making logical, reasonable arguments for why the hero should give up his quest! Also note that the hero tries to avoid killing people even when they're trying to kill him. A must-see if you're not normally an action fan but are open to the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know about anyone else, but I've been a big fan of Mos Def's music for quite some time, and it felt just to see him in a movie that brings to life the portrait he's painted before through his music of corruption in the system. I recall a line from a song by him with something to the effect of, "You can't tell the cops from the criminals." And I believe this movie did a great job of bringing that lyric to life through the story told in 16 Blocks. It's almost as if Mos Def purposely scouted out this film, because it embodies his message in his music. Great work, good movie, Bruce Willis did exceptional as always. Glad I saw it. Hope others enjoyed it as much as I did.</fullReview>

He is an underrated actor who deserves every plaudit for playing this part perfectly. However, MOS DEF STEALS THE SCREEN when he appears as the fast-talking witness to a police cover-up. He delivers his lines in a credible, flawless manner...comical and at times sad. He lends the thriller a compassionate and funny presence. You'll laugh and cry. The special effects are exciting and believable. Few scenes are predictable and the ending is what every viewer wants after watching this story unfold. The other actors are wonderful!!! Don't pass this movie by. I purchased it for my collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruce Willis is still good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But this film is not as good and tight as other Bruce Willis films. No where near as good as Tears of the Sun. Hostage was also far better. also the story of corrupt police is getting old for Willis. on one hand Willis seems to support 911 victims in his real life talking. But this film rips the police department again. It is so old.It also glorifies and glosses over the real evil that our police encounter every day in real life and is designed to make one sympathize with the criminals. Also the story is shaky and not as action packed as hostage which was way better. The courts are overwhelmed with crime and here again the police are portrayed as bad guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost in Transition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering that here's a film with a dramatic core that's overtly geographic, "16 Blocks" is an oddity indeed: there's absolutely no sense of topography at all. The remorseless inching, block by city block, of hunted and hunters towards both destination and denouement is entirely foregone.It's like seeing "3.10 To Yuma" or "High Noon" without a single reference to a ticking clock.Or having Keifer Sutherland go through an entire 24 hours without consulting his wristwatch.Quite how so great a disconnect occurred betwixt concept and execution is inexplicable: the director is not inexperienced; the script is not without intelligence; and the actors certainly fulfil their obligations.So. . . just what happened to "16 Blocks"? Is a new vogue in movie-making about to be ushered in -- a remake of "Phonebox", for example, set entirely on a baseball plate? Or "Field of Dreams". . . set entirely in a phone box?Baffling.But then, so too is the movie's rationale: though 'The Gauntlet' remains one of the best Worst Movies ever made, Eastwood's performance was at least fuelled by a palpable adrenaline. Whereas in "16 Blocks", Willis's is fuelled -- if that's the right word -- by nothing stronger than, er, Prozac.Under-playing, of course, is infinitely preferable to over-playing (unless in a farce) but Willis is here so muted as to be well-nigh catatonic. In theory, this certainly provides a counter-point to Mos Def's infinitely more voluble character, but in practice, doesn't work at all: for a considerable amount of the film's running time, neither the subdued Willis nor the excitable Def are remotely comprehensible.No wonder that many viewers are going to wonder if "16 Blocks" has taken a leaf out of a quite different tree -- "Some Like It Hot" comes to mind -- and instead of chronicling the aftermath of a massacre in a Chicago garage is chronicling the aftermath of a massacre in a New York bakery.It's definitely something to do with cakes.Indeed, it might even have something to do with a mild bout of food poisoning, for Donner's directorial hand is anything but steady and his vision, anything but fresh: the device of the Substitute Gunshot -- where you think someone has been shot by someone else, only it turns out it's someone else who's been shot by someone else -- is OK once in a movie, but twice is pushing it and three times, even more so.(As for the device of the Substitute Ambulance, well; perhaps Donner really was feeling so unwell that he started fantasising about Medicare.)Pushing it, too, is the notion of the burnt out NYPD cop. Because it's not a notion but a cliché. And as a cliché, really needs a darn sight more than Willis could ever be expected to provide: he may be good on the sardonic smile, the throw-away line, but if you're going to put substance into a role like this then you need an actor infinitely more capable of the visceral, the angry.(Yes. I still miss Lee Marvin.) Sorely miscast, then, Willis does the best he can do, and if on too many occasions seems more on the verge of tears than the verge of shooting anyone, well, that's more likely Donner's fault than his: a director who seemingly briefed his lead to act as though he was going to lash out with nothing more homicidal than a Kleenex tissue has only himself to blame for the outcome.Donner's treatment of Mos Def's character is, however, even more bewildering: it's as if the sense of disconnection that permeates this movie, and so thoroughly undermines it, has here been taken to its directorial limit, so that in several scenes the character doesn't so much resemble a frightened witness running in fear of his life as an unintelligible half-wit who is entirely disconnected from the reality of people trying to kill him, such is his obsessive preoccupation with recipes for, er, birthday cakes.It could be post-modernism, of course. But I doubt it. Even so. "16 Blocks", or "15 Cakes", or whatever it was the narrative arc here embraces, does rate higher than the minus 1 such a filmic mess might otherwise merit.Clichés notwithstanding -- and oh ye Gods, "people change" stands a good 10ft higher in the mind's eye than even Willis's character -- Richard Wenk's script is actually quite polished. And Mos Def's performance is anything but shabby. The movie also gets a point for eschewing the modish juvenilia of foul language: it's a welcome Mutther Effing free zone.3/10 then. Though sadly, no candles on any cake for anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt so strongly about this movie whilst watching it that I had to register on IMDb and let others know how I feel when it was only 50 minutes old. I couldn't get past how annoying Mos Def's voice was. I seriously thought it was a joke and would change at any moment. This took away any enjoyment of the movie whatsoever. I ordered it on cable because I like Bruce Willis but I will be contacting my provider and asking for my money back. I was trying to compare it to the worst movies I have ever seen but cannot think of one that is anywhere near as annoying as this. I am by no means a harsh judge, I even took some positives away from DOOM but this is in another league altogether. Avoid it like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very clichéd film from the outset as an alcoholic cop transports across (yes 16 blocks) New York to give witness to police corruption. Just pause for just 30 seconds and imagine could possibly happen...yes you are correct. The other New York cops (who for some reason are also all corrupt) make many failed attempts to kill him but for some really weird reason seem to know exactly where he is going. Are they using some supernatural technique to locate them??? well it would probably make this film more interesting to watch. This film actually annoyed the hell out of me and it is rare for one to do this. The reason? I couldn't understand a single word they spoke. I actually had to have the subtitles as they constantly mumbled their words. I was fairly sure that New Yorkers could speak intelligible English. The other thing that annoyed me was that the Mos Def's character couldn't stop talking and it wasn't anything useful. I felt so angry that I had to write this and warn many others...do not watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie today, opening day in my hometown. And I really liked it very much ... fast action, great intensity, fine acting, crooked cops, New York streets, redemption in the end ... what's not to like?Cinematography was great, pacing perfect. The action is fast-paced with lots of plot twists that are just right without being over the top. Acting is fine, with Bruce Willis fine as the alcoholic aging cop with a limp who still packs a punch. David Morse did a good job too. But the really superb acting performance was that of Mos Def ... in fact, he really dominates this movie, with a wonderfully appealing characterization and absolutely splendid job from beginning to end.This is simply a great movie ... if you like action flicks, check this one out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better Bruce Willis films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first thought was: "great, another Bruce Willis film. oh yea." Then I watched "16 Blocks," and I was pleasantly surprised. I was pretty much in suspense throughout the film. Bruce Willis plays a middle-aged (and burnt out?) NYC cop who is assigned to transport a criminal to testify in court. It's from the jail house to the courthouse, located 16 blocks away, where much of the action takes place.You will definitely be rooting for the good guys, and perhaps finding yourself applauding at certain scenes. It was an entertaining film. Not sure if I would pay $10 (I saw the sneak peek for free) but it is definitely worth renting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unnecessary remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake - revised, updated and relocated - of "The Gauntlet", a mid-'70s action film starring, and directed by, Clint Eastwood, about a burnt-out cop who dedicates himself to preserving the life of a witness to police corruption. Eastwood's film was really not much more than a "B-movie', but it was well made, and Eastwood used the film as one of his earliest efforts to work through the problem of a character development - how it is that people stuck in a rut somehow manage to redefine themselves in response to unexpected crisis.In "16 Blocks), that noble theme is reduced to mere slogan - 'people do change'. And this slogan is the only real gesture the film makes towards any sort of real character development. In fact the characters are all the same at the end as they were at the beginning; and I don't believe for a moment the arbitrarily tacked on ending that supposedly reassures us that - hey, 'people do change'. Thank you, slogan; roll credits.Don't blame the actors, they're actually doing their best; they're just not given anything to work with. The dialog (lacking in any real spark of interest) is partly to blame; but the real fault of this impoverishment of drama is director Donner's. It's clear from the get-go that he doesn't care a flying squirrel for this picture - his comments on the DVD added material almost state this outright. So he just comes in, tinkers with some machine, and heads home for dinner - who cares what the result is? - where's the paycheck! But that doesn't simply abuse the production company getting the money together for this project, it abuses the audience that has come to expect some degree of professionalism from Donner - but here, he let's us down.Lesson to be learned: Only make films when you think you can bring something interesting to the project.Skip this, see "The Gauntlet" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most disappointing movie I have seen in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie was painful from beginning to end. The plot was predictable, characters were one-dimensional, and the action was passable at best, but the worst part was having to listen to Mos Def's character as a ultra-stereotypical black small time criminal with a thick street accent banter on and on and on about nothing the whole length of the movie. Not that my expectations were all that high, but I was hoping for at least some pleasant cheap entertainment. I honestly had no idea that Bruce Willis' career has sunk so low that he would consider doing this caliber of a movie. The dirty NY cop genre has been done to death, and this movie certainly did not introduce any new or interesting spins that would make it worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so vomitrociously awful that words are barely adequate to describe the gut-wrenching nausea that still lingers in the pit of my stomach from suffering through it even as I type this review. There was virtually no redeeming value in the entire film, paper thin character (characature) development, slow pace (negligible action in this "action" movie), and lifeless storyline. Mos Def is the worst actor I have ever seen in my life, bar none. His highly chronic-influenced, slurred-speech delivery constantly reminded me of the "Home Boys" from in Living Color who sold hot merchandise on their infomercials except they were actually funny, where as Mos is the real deal, and it's just torture to sit through. The attempts at making him "the Stupid but Lovable Guy" fail so badly it's disgraceful. Then there's the plot. It's so cliché'd and uninteresting it barely warrants mention but let's just say if you've ever even seen even one "crooked cop" movie, then you've seen one that was much better than this one, it is simply at the very bottom of the barrel. I can't believe this is the "Lethal Weapon" guy as those are some of my favorite movies of all time, interesting, intelligent, witty and insightful. In sum, AVOID at ALL costs and you'll be VERY glad you did.</fullReview>

Not to mention Frank chews his gum like a cow eating saltwater taffy. What. The. Hell. My boyfriend watched it so I was subjected to some of the garbage. Mos Def really does seem mildly retarded.

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis plays a drunk cop used to turning a blind eye, in what anyone with half a brain will figure out as being the Big Twist before half an hour has been played out.Regrettably predictable with an incredibly annoying witness Willis is supposed to escort to testify (the name "Mos Def" made me think he's some kind of rapper, which the producers probably figured would bring in a bigger pre-established fan-base), it's hard to not want corrupt cops to just shoot the bugger in the face and put him out of our misery.Willis, of course, tries to do the right thing throughout, and refrains from seriously injurying New York's not-so finest, which added a nice touch to the action scenes and growing resentment his fellow detectives feel towards him, but unfortunately, the tension never quite develops to the level it should be at, rendering what could have been an excellent film very much a middle-of-the-road one.The ending is somewhat touching and unexpected, but it's best watched alone, as then it's a much more engrossing film than if viewed with company who could easily be unimpressed after 45 minutes and divert your attention elsewhere.</fullReview>

If I was Willis I would had shot him dead as soon as I sat in the car with him!It soon becomes clear that there are cops who are out to kill the witness and its Willis job to save him and deliver him to court. Hot on the tail are dirty cops led by Willis's ex partner (David Morse).The film is directed by Richard Donner and together with Willis you might have expected some bone crunching action mixed with humour instead it is a run of the mill thriller rather po faced, Mos Def does not provide the laughs but actually is irritating.

		<shortDescription>Not As High As Its Idea !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the 24 hours plot for a movie whatever the genre was. (Willis) got his share at the Die Hard series. When I knew that this movie's events take place in just a little bit more than an hour and half, factually and dramatically, and it's a thriller too, I became totally obsessed.There are previous similar cases like John Badham's (Nick of Time), which was satisfying on so many levels. But here even the presence of one of my favorite directors (Richard Donner), along with (Bruce Willis) in a situation of making an effort through a role, didn't help this movie to live up to its incredible idea.I think it's in the script. The clichéd characters contributed to make it flat. Even the character of (David Morse) saying the same words again and again without the magical -never been thought about- solution : go inside the character. One of the tackiest goods from America is the usual prototype evil man who is forever evil and forever without a reason but being evil ! We didn't go either inside the character of (Willis), movies can success with cool charisma, couple of nice lines, some hot scenes, but never been thoughtfully remembered without a good building for the character, despite the great rare efforts of (Willis) at it.Moreover, the script didn't give us other minor characters to leave any kind of humanly deep meaning. Obviously it's straight pure thriller from Hollywood, but even this same Hollywood taught us that through other movies, yet this one wanted nothing but being THE B MOVIE, THE PASTIME SHOW, THE BANG BANG FLICK, however not as huge, crazy, intense, as its likes by (Willis) or else.The movie didn't even try to present the features of the city and its people. Plus my strong feeling about the way of making the whole thing; sometimes you'd feel that it doesn't go anywhere (the whole of the bus situation till the fabricated end of it!). Absurdly it looked weak after the precise scene of killing the first assassinate in the street, since that the rhythm ranged between slack and intensive. Even what supposed to be the wonderful twist (Willis discovering that he was saving the one who'd testify against him) wasn't done cinematically well.Then that cold anticlimax !!, like the filmmakers wanted it uninteresting and too light to feel the romantic relationship along with the transpiration of the characters through real friendship, or anything else that frozen scene with that frozen photo ! As you see, it's an idea that had been developed lukewarmly into a whole movie which wasn't that crazy action or that humanly sweet.I've got to ask where is the music? There is an exceptional lack of music all over it, since we're talking absolute Action and stuff. Most of the shots seemed in close-ups, it consolidated the absence of cinematic case, like another TV action. And the editing wasn't hot enough, as I noticed a fat pretty lady walking behind Willis and Def in the street with particular clothes, then I watched her again behind them in another street with another clothes !, that Never happens in resembling flicks ! And casting (David Morse) as the evil guy in front of (Willis) wasn't a prosperous deal. There is unequal charisma that may tell you how (Willis) even alcoholic and wounded must triumph eventually whatever what. (Morse) is fine actor no doubt about that, but less charismatic to feel that he can beat (Willis) or even threaten him seriously. On the other hand, it's so hard to the extent of impassible to determine who was better, Willis or Mos Def?! Because both, especially vocally, made a finer job. As for Willis, he played the role of (a guard of one troubling target exposed to kill) at (Mercury Rising - 1998), so he had to be, not only to look, different. Despite the routine writing, I enjoyed his successful attempt and his brilliant acting which's something we didn't use to have from him lately (or ever, regarding the types of his movies throughout the last 20 years !) That was one challenge in a movie was not much of a challenger itself !I loved the scene of Willis's intro (at the Latino murdered guy's apartment), that was gold. Also the moment where he kills the first murderer, as the bottle of wine/his long slumber shattered on the sidewalk, it's certainly the greatest moment of this movie, as well as one magical moment of cinema. Or the surprisingly shoot at the bar by the hidden gun/Willis's old but effective idealism. And finally the scene where Willis ? the gifted star and actor ? tells Def at the bus bitterly and wittily : "You're Killing me !". Sorrowfully they were detached perfect works, that still few outstanding glances through a ride wasn't as special as its potentials. In one word it's above mediocre yet not high.Question : is it a remake of (The Gauntlet - 1977)? with witness must be killed, a drunk cop, even a bus has been besieged by dirty cops ??, I think not. It's whether a huge homage, or just laziness !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With Intent to Act...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Has Bruce Willis been taking acting lessons? Rather than Just Another Tough Guy Infurio role, in 16 BLOCKS, Willis has put some nuanced daylight between himself and The John McClane. His detective Jack Mosley is haggard, worn-out, somber, morose, sporting a paunch (which looks suspiciously like a pillow), washing down meds with cheap whiskey, and so out-of-shape he loses breath climbing stairs. It is almost hilarious to see Willis play so debilitated.Yet the John McClane id still ebbs in this character's veins ? when faced with Saving The Day, he will. But not willingly. Roger Ebert describes The John McClance best: "It's going to be a pain in the ass for me to do this, but I couldn't live with myself if I didn't." What he has to "do" in this Richard Donner-directed actioner is transport a witness, Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), sixteen blocks in two hours, to a courthouse to testify. What starts as a seemingly mindless, shitkicking assignment turns into a gauntlet-run as everyone who DOESN'T want Eddie to testify comes at Eddie and Mosley hell-tilt with murderous intent.For that dramatic knife in the guts, the people who don't want Eddie to testify are ? THE COPS. Twisting the knife: they're led by Mosley's ex-partner, Detective Nugent (David Morse).The first plagiarized movie plot that comes to mind is Clint Eastwood's THE GAUNTLET (1977), and I'm sure there are a thousand other movies in this "running the gauntlet" genre, yet this movie's 105 well-paced minutes, written by Richard Wenk, rush by on the strength of the performances.Willis has always had the acting chops ? in this movie and in HOSTAGE (2005), he actually throws them down; and we all know how sturdy David Morse is (DANCER IN THE DARK, THE GREEN MILE) ? at one point, his conflicting emotions are incredible to behold, when he confronts his ex-partner, Mosley, but cannot shoot him, then gives the order for someone else to do so ? but the acting revelation here is most definitely Mos Def.Never let it be said this guy is "just a rapper" ? his attention to the Eddie character is indicative of his talent as a full-blooded, mustered ARTIST ? from his adenoidal motormouth, to his browbeaten stoop, to carrying around a scrapbook with scrawled birthday cake recipes because he wants to "go straight" and become a baker ? Mos Def is a sensation!His best line can also be applied to what he and Willis wrought on their characters throughout this entertaining ride: When Nugent thinks he has the drop on Mosley, "You can't get lucky all the time!" Eddie then ambushes Nugent, "You can be smart every day, though!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An engaging but disappointing film. There's all the tension and action one would expect from a Willis-fronted pursuit thriller. Donner catches New York very well. The only landmark is an early background view of the Brooklym Bridge: from there on Donner goes for claustraphobically framed shots of back streets and corners. I imagine this is a faithful and affectionate capturing of New York.Willis acts well despite a badly assembled prosthetic tummy. Mos Def is OK. Alas, both suffer from the contemporary malaise of the thriller genre, requiring actors to obscure their lines in delivery. Despite Willis/Def's best efforts though enough of the script remains audible for one to tell that it's a bit of a patchwork - indeed the ending itself is a late alternative.There is one bonus in the late appearance of Jenna Stern as Willis' sister. She's an almost obtrusively beautiful woman who also manages to act convincingly and with impact in her 3-scene role. This is the sort of stand-out that made the career of Julianna Moore (in The Fugitive). I'll look forward to more of her. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story is alright, but the rest is dull and uninspired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching 16 Blocks unfold reminded me a lot of a new episode of The Simpsons. You can see that the ideas they are setting up are different, and you can see the actors/voices are attempting to try something new too. But at the end, predictability sets in and it just feels stale and dull. Not that it is atrociously bad by any stretch, just that it has no zest to make it anywhere near as memorable as past works. That is exactly what 16 Blocks feels like.Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis) is a down-on-his-luck detective who is more accustomed to drinking on the job, then actually doing his job. You get mere hints that he actually did something before this point in his life, but now, he's just an old guy who cannot catch a break. Just as he punches out, one of his senior officers asks him a favour. He needs to transport Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), a witness, to a trial sixteen blocks away before ten o'clock. It is only eight at this point, so Mosley does not think much of it. But when he stops to buy some booze and ends up shooting a would be assassin attempting to kill Bunker and then finds out that many of his fellow officers, including his ex-partner of twenty years Frank Nugent (David Morse), he realizes that the trip is going to be a bit harder than he thought.The film is not incredibly original, but the story is interesting enough to at least hold some interest. But as the thrilling action film it tries to be, it really does not please the audience the way it should. Yes, I did enjoy the fact that the film did not need to rely on blowing everything up or shooting everyone in sight, but it just felt very dull for all of the actions on screen. This should be a break-neck thriller. It sure is paced like one, the story is attempting to be one and the actors are acting like it is one. But it just is not meant to be. The visuals are slow, and joyless. And the dialogue is clunky and at times, just silly. Nothing they say really sounds too "detective-esque", and everything just does not sound grounded in realism. And when things do, the characters brush them off. In one instance, Willis' Mosley uses some newspaper to great yet simplistic effect, and a fellow officer mentions what a good cop he must be because of his knowledge about what he's doing. Well of course, he has been on the force for over twenty years, you should expect him to know at least a few easy things.Another thing that is wrong are the way these characters are framed. Mosley is supposed to be a drunk in bad shape. Yet he can still be trying to run Bunker to the courthouse, despite still being drunk? Adrenaline can only go so far, never mind the fact that the guy barely talks and has the interest level of watching paint dry. And Bunker? We are supposed to sympathize with him because he wants to change, and he keeps harping on the idea of the signs pointing to how easy it is to change. And then how he wants to start a bakery. And then how he is not a bad guy. And then how he is. And then...it just goes on and on. Let this guy focus on one thing at one time already. Trying to make a clear-cut one-dimensional character a three-dimensional one just by sprinkling on some extra character traits does not make up for the fact that he is still one-dimensional. It is almost as if the writer is trying to make excuses for why his character is written so shoddily.What did not help of course with Bunker is the voice Def uses for the entire movie. It is a bit like the regular lisp-thing he uses all the time, but babied down. He sounds like an eight year old, but he is acting like he is in his thirties. It just does not jive, and it gets annoying way too fast. Def himself is alright in the role, but he really does not have much to do except go on the tangents about changing. Willis is okay as Mosley, but he played this same role before in Die Hard with a Vengeance, and he was about one hundred times better in that. It did not help of course that he drags himself through this role, and he actually had enthusiasm for John McClaine, but that is besides the point. Their chemistry together is even worse. Def just continues to keep chatting to Willis throughout the entire movie, and since Willis is too busy giving his best block-of-wood impression, Def just keeps talking to no effect at all. These guys are clearly not buddies, so why try to play them off as such? Morse is underwritten as one of the villains, but being a great character actor, he makes him his own and does very well for himself. He is not too evil, but he does a much better job of being the antagonist than Willis and Def do as protagonists. At least he had the good sense of having some form intensity instilled in his character. Unfortunately, there really are no other actors to speak for, as they all have tiny bit parts, or just do barely anything at all.On the whole, 16 Blocks is a film that could have been made so much better than it was. As it is, the story is alright, and the villain is great yet underwritten. If they beefed up the villain, forced Willis to have some flare and ensured that Def dropped that stupid voice of his, than this could have been a far better picture. As it stands, it is just dull and uninspired.4.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apart from Mos Def, this is a pretty good action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has just arrived recently on Portuguese theaters, a movie I've been waiting to see for a very long time, especially considering it's a Richard "Dick" Donner movie. It tells the story of an out-of-shape,old and depressed police officer(Bruce Willis) whose given an assignment to escort a witness(Mos Def) to a grand jury by 10 am all that in just 16 Blocks, nothing too fancy. After Mosley(Willis) makes one short stop to buy some booze, he realizes that there might be something very important about that witness for someone to send hit men to kill him(some dirty cops are involved too), so getting to the courtroom becomes an important priority. What's next is an entire movie full of chasing, shoot-outs, tense moments and some minor comical relief all of this to provide a great action movie. The story is simple and straightforward, nothing too fancy, but good enough to keep you going on the edge of your seat for roughly 2 hours. The acting is gold, Bruce Willis almost vanishes when he plays Jack Mosley as he delivers the strongest performance in the movie, even without much dialog and even if everybody else's performance was below-average he could carry the movie on his own, David Morse plays the dirty cop(who's Mosley's ex-partner)who wants the witness killed at all cost, plays a respectable villain and one of his lines("F**k the truth!"), is easily up there with Jack Nicholson's "You can't handle the truth!". My reaction to Mos Def's character is mixed, some of his lines are good, but his annoying voice-acting puzzles me, it kinda like he's playing Dave Chapelle and Bugs Bunny at the same time and it feels like he's a bit out of character during the entire movie which has a hard time blending in with most of the serious presentation seen on this movie, a somewhat different voice could work, but fortunately most of the movie make up for this short-coming. But in a way, he works well with Bruce Willis's more serious and no-nonsense know-how, as they have great chemistry. As far as action movies go, Casino Royale was pretty dull compared to this one. For cop/thriller movies, you will enjoy this one, I know I do and putting this movie on my DVD wish list just became a big priority.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring movie - watch Die Hard again and don't bother with this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Bruce Willis movies and he rarely lets me down, and Richard Donner is awesome too, but hes been making more boring movies than exciting ones in the last while.I had heard very little about this movie when I bought it and I just got around to watching it and it was the perfect 5 star out of 10 movie cause it wasn't awful nor was it good - just right in the middle.A lot of gunfire and big budget bus crashes couldn't save this movie because the characters were dull and I could care less about any of them. Mos Def sucks as an actor and even Bruce was dry in this movie.It was worth a watch I guess cause it's slightly different than most, but then again you will not see anything you haven't seen somewhere else. Just watch one of Donners great directed movies or a good action movie like Die Hard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Bad as the Gauntlet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read other user reviews before I watched this movie. I was ready to dislike it. But, it wasn't really bad at all. Yes, it does borrow from lots of other movies: The Gauntlet (a really dreadful stupid movie), Witness, Midnight Run, The Getaway, 48 Hours, maybe even Sugarland Express a little.It was mildly entertaining, but with some serious faults. Mos Def does not quickly capture our hearts, due to his irritating nasal monotonous voice; and he never shuts up! Willis was maybe a little TOO world-weary. For some reason, David Morse's little beard annoyed me, although his was a good performance. I found the fact that everyone in the picture referred to Eddie Bunker (Def's character) as "the Kid" a bit wearing on the nerves, as he is clearly not a kid. And the ending was a bit confusing. It seemed to imply that Willis somehow planned to go thorough all this, even when he clearly only got the escorting job by chance.It is Willis, however, who carries the picture. Weary or not, his skill and screen presence made the difference. Def, despite his non-stop banter, in the long run does a decent job conveying the humanity of a minor street hood trying to get his ticket out of the 'hood punched.It was OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big, dumb, and loud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Willis is a jaded, drunken cop whose conscience inexplicably kicks in when he takes the mission of transporting a witness across town to testify to a grand jury about police corruption. In the process of this moral transformation he (among other things) shoots other cops, who are all out to kill the witness to stop him from testifying.The attempt here is to amp up the Chase Movie to the emotional pitch of, say, "Speed." Certainly the director has chops for this type of film, but mostly it's used here to construct successively louder and less believable confrontations. And, speaking of "Speed", this includes hijacking a bus.There's not really wrong with this film -- it keeps moving and the gunshots and violence will at least ensure you don't sleep through it. But there's also little to recommend a movie where you can't believe the action or the motivations, and where you've seen it all done before. The ending (which I won't spoil) attempts to both provide a positive resolution and explain Willis' actions. A neat trick, if you can pull it off. This movie, however, can't.As I said in the subject line: big, dumb, and loud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A decent action thriller with a solid performance by Willis and a truly grating and irritating one by Mos Def. Seriously, I could not understand half of what he was saying. Nearly ruined the movie for me. Luckily, the story was interesting and the pace tight, so that I enjoyed the film overall. Not a moment was wasted, the suspense and thrills were kept up throughout, and the action scenes were exciting. The plot was intriguing but made little sense, and the characters were mostly unrealistic, but that's something to expect from a film like this. Willis has done far worse. Nothing special, just a generic action thriller. Fair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was disappointed with this movie so many times during the screening. An example of what I elude to in my summary is: Jack is on the bus surrounded by the police (some of which I know are the crooked ones) and this is presented to us a a conflict to be resolved? How about getting the commissioner on the phone and telling him about the crooked cops and the need for the DA's offices involvement. There is no reasonable explanation or suspension of disbelief that would explain why he didn't to that. Sorry this film was a waste of some good talent and a few good performances.

		<fullReview>What a disappointment! I was waiting for this movie for so long, always trusted Bruce Willis as a great actor and now suddenly - such a shallow film. This is not only Bruce's fault, although the way he plays is not so convincing. Tell me, do you know any other Bruce's facial expressions except for a cat-like smile and a frown? The plot is so predictable, that it becomes boring after 15 minutes of the watching process. I could almost immediately foretell what happened next before it actually appeared on screen. Another big failure was the performance of David Morse. I also was and am his admirer, but here again, like in Bruce's case, there is no deep or sincere actor's work. What we see is just an exchange of dialog lines, then some shooting, then again some dialogs, then again running and shooting. And the biggest disillusion came in the disguise of Mr. Def - his play was almost irritating. Please, do not give him roles where he has to talk so much. Very sad that this film failed to live to the expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gauntlet Remade ...But Still Watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resting heavily on the shoulders of THE GAUNTLET (Clint Eastwood, 1977), 16 BLOCKS gives us a standard Bruce Willis action film and does so admirably. Not overly so, but a positive nod is deserved.Jack Mosley (Willis) is an old, alcoholic cop who's always done "the right thing" for his department. And now he's assigned to take a fast-talking thug named Eddie (rapper Mos Def) just 16 blocks for a court appearance. Trouble is, though, Eddie is scheduled to testify against some crooked cops who live and breath right in Jack's backyard. Jack is unaware of this and soon discovers he's got much more than just a simple escort job on his hands. People (cops mainly) are trying to kill Eddie. Jack quickly has to make a decision: protect Eddie and "do the right moral thing," or let his fellow brethren have their way with him and "do the right thing for the department." Willis plays the aging cop well. He grumbles and drinks and generally hates what he does. The dirty New York offices and streets were shot well and gave an overall sense of the uncleanliness of Jack's life (including his past, which comes up toward the end of the film).Mos Def plays the irritating convict and his grating voice bugged the crap out of me. He sounded very nasal and whiney but, in contrast, this added a strange upbeat quality to a film that could've gotten too dark.I also like the fact that Willis isn't trying to play the "young stud" anymore on film. He's getting older and I'm happy to see him in roles befitting his age.The alternate endings on the DVD are worth watching, too. Personally, I would've gone with an alternate ending rather than the one seen in theaters. But maybe that's just me...</fullReview>

AND AND on top of the fact that they work when you are fast forwarding because that was the only way I could get through this movie!! it was utterly horrible save for the last 15-20 minutes where it was actually somewhat interesting.I could not stand the way that Eddie (Mos Def) - what was that supposed to be?? a NY autistic accent? give me a break... by the time they were cornered down in the back alleys of the subway system I had to put it on mute and just read the captions! to be honest if I had to listen to him for an hour I can see why everyone wanted to shoot him... I probably would have done the same thing myself.I would say that Bruce Willis' portrayal of a working drunk was pretty good but hey how hard can that really be?? his character was flat and had no depth until the very last scene of the movie. The only point in the film that I felt had any real emotional impact.I would only save a lower rating like a 1 for a movie that should have the production company PAYING me to watch it - where I've actually written and asked for my money back! This film is not that bad, but really I felt it was like torture of some kind having to watch it.</fullReview>

It had interesting characters, an interesting story, a low level of over-the-top twists/explosions/impossibilities and it was shot with quite a high level of realism (lighting, settings, extras...) but.Why did they have to make it so unclear? Sometimes it was simply impossible to see what was going on through a mixture of darkness, extreme close-ups and fast-editing. Good grief, I'm only 35... are my eyes *that bad* already? Not only my eyes - my hearing must be going too. I had to *concentrate* to understand the dialogue throughout the entire thing! Not one person spoke without mumbling... and of course Eddie's speech has already been discussed enough here. My take: he's supposed to be annoying, but it was just too much.So for me this movie was pretty good, a little clearer sound &amp; vision would have made it very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'16 Blocks' is the kind of a movie you know isn't going to be great from the moment you walk into it. But, I had hope it would be greatly entertaining. I like Bruce Willis a lot and Mos Def is probably one of if not the best rapper turned actor. But when those ending credits started to role, I said to myself, "There's a lot of stuff I'd do differently with this film if I directed." The film is entertaining through-out, but it is also very annoying. It's annoying in the sense that the movie becomes way too preachy towards the end and gets awful sappy in parts. They overplay the bond between Willis and Def the way an Oscar-winning drama would, but let's call a spade a spade, '16 Blocks' isn't any near that quality. Mos Def's character's dialect is also very annoying. He sounds like Mike Tyson on a blender, and frankly after fifteen minutes it REALLY gets to you. As for the action sequences, '16 Blocks' shines. Great car wreck/chase scenes and awesome shoot-outs prevent '16 Blocks' from ultimately plummeting into the 'D ' range. Grade: C+ (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 3/03/06)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello Moviegoers, This week Marsha picked the film so we saw 16 Blocks,the girl likes a little adrenalin in her movies. 16 Blocks stars Bruce Willis playing a version of his generic cop role. Take his Die-hard character throw in fifteen years of alcohol abuse and more than a few ethical lapses. Presto. The real life of the party in this movie is Mos Def as, frankly, is often the case with any movie he is in, Lackawanna Blues, The Italian Job, Monster's Ball, Hitchhiker's Guide.In this picture he is a squirrelly little thief trying to survive the 16 block trip to court in lower Manhattan. His portrayal of a certain NY type is just perfect, kind of a black Ratso Rizzo.Other than the characters it's not much of a movie, a predictable little crime movie. You know, a couple of gunfights a chase scene, in this case with a city bus, nothing spectacular in that department. Just skip it. 16 Blocks ho hum. Better luck next week.This IS K-PYGThis is 1340 KYNS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I enjoy a good action movie, I am sad to say, having just seen this film this weekend, that this one was mediocre. Bruce Willis and David Morse were once again cast in roles that must feel like wearing an old glove. Willis, as the weary, baggage-heavy, usually alcohol troubled cop, and David Morse as the villainous cop, a la his role in The Negotiator. I think Willis is a decent actor, but often he is cast in films where he doesn't always shine. To be fair, this movie was mildly enjoyable, but very predictable. This being my first time seeing Mos Def, he was interesting, but his character got to be irritating at times. If you are interested in seeing this, please wait until it is available via rental or cable. Overall, I would have to give it a C, neither bad, nor great.</fullReview>

The only thing that spoilt the movie for me was the amateur filming - it looks at times as if the cameraman is holding a home movie camera. The swaying to and fro gives you the front row experience even if you are seated near the back.At one stage they are in a Chinese laundry and you find yourself thinking about the drunken cameraman and not the story, to the point where it gets confusing as to what is really happening. My recommendation is to wait for this movie to get to the dollar theaters or else wait until it comes out on DVD.This is not the only movie to suffer from this amateurish filming - what has happened to our standards of film-making? Pay the stars a bit less and the technical crew a bit more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis does a good job portraying a jaded, washed up and alcoholic detective in the twilight of his career. The fundamentals of the plot are sound - what should be the mundane task of escorting a witness to court becomes a fight-and-flight battle for survival.Unfortunately, the plot doesn't develop in any particularly thrilling manner and there are few surprises along the way. That said, it's perfectly watchable and sufficiently entertaining to prevent one reaching for the "stop" button......with one possible exception. Mos Def (Dante Terrell Smith)For reasons I cannot begin to fathom, Mr. Def decides to play his character's voice with a really grating, nasal twang. It sounds like his character has a severe cleft-palate. I found myself almost rooting for the bad guys, hoping a well-aimed round would silence him once and for all!</fullReview>

But someone does not want that, and they do anything in there power, to stop them. It's satisfying to see "Bruce Willis", in a little more old and lazy edition. Where he dosn't tear down, and entire army of terrorist. But instead use clever, and twisting ways to do it. It's a decent action movie, and i can recommend it, for any "Bruce Willis", fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis plays an aging, out of shape, alcoholic cop. He is asked to take a witness to court. What he doesn't know is the witness is going to testify against other cops including himself. Other cops start trying to kill him and the witness. So, if this witness is against cops, then why are the cops taking him to court. And why did they pick someone to take him to court that is not in on the plan. And of course the lead dirty cop is the ex-partner of Willis.Other questions, why doesn't Willis simply take a taxi to court? Why doesn't he call the DA and tell her not to talk to anyone and come pick them up or call the press to help him get to court? And I don't think cops would really be that awful by wanting to kill the witness, when all they have to do is keep him from getting to court.But, most of all, why do the cops think the jury would believe a career criminal who talks like he isn't very smart over a bunch of cops. Makes no sense.FINAL VERDICT: Not the worst movie out there, but still not that good. I don't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Richard Donner knows how to make something simple interesting. 16 BLOCKS is a crime drama that has its twists and turns. Out of shape with a serious drinking problem, detective Jack Mosley(Bruce Willis)wants to go home and call it a day...but he is assigned to escort a petty criminal Eddie Bunker(Mos Def)from the precinct to the courthouse where he will be a witness to put a dirty cop away. The trek will not be routine; it turns into a complex journey when cops start shooting at the beer-bellied cop and paranoid criminal. There are some exciting moments, but it is the chemistry between Mosley and Bunker that sustains the movie; and there is a few laughs along the way. Supporting cast features: David Morse, Casey Sander, Jenna Stern, Cylk Cozart and Brenda Pressley.</fullReview>

The cold and callous cop who doesn't mind killing as many people as he has to in order to avoid getting in trouble. In the end, everyone is happy. The only redeeming qualities about this movie was the fact that I only paid 3$ to see it and that it gave me an excuse to drink (depression brought on by the fact that people like such terrible messes).If you want a movie that goes bang and you don't have to think about, knock yourself out on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis acts as Jack Mosley, a drunk Police Officer that seems to be stumbling through his shift waiting for his next fix of Alcohol. He is assigned all the jobs that no one wants. Five minutes after his shift ends he is given the job of transferring Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) to the Courthouse that is just 16 Blocks away. He has 2 hours to do this easy task. Practically the entire film then takes place in the next two hours while Jack Mosley tries to get Eddie to the Courthouse while trying to avoid the dirty cops trying to kill them.Mos Def is the only saving grace of this poorly scripted Movie that seems to be drawing on influences from Speed (long drawn out joy ride)and Assault on Precinct 13 (dirty cops vs good cops battle it out in close quarters for witness). Mos Def's Character is a very talkative low level career criminal who is very hard to understand and is seeking to go straight. He has apparently witnessed something (its never really made clear what and indeed he is unsure too) and is due to testify before a Jury about Crooked cops.16 Blocks is very disappointing and predictable. Only worth watching on a Rainy Sunday afternoon when you are hung over from the night before and don't want to do any thinking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am giving nothing away that is not already in the trailers for this movie by saying Bruce Willis plays an aging cop who is asked to take a suspect (Mos Def) 16 blocks to the court house. The bad guys are basically trying to stop them getting there. If this sounds like the plot of The Gauntlet I don't think its just some wild coincidence.Lets digress for a moment. If you have seen Dumb and Dumber there is a scene set in the truck where Jim Carey says "Do you want to hear the most annoying sounds in the world?" and then he makes a truly annoying sound. Thats how Mos Def speaks in this movie! I found his incessant nasal drawl utterly annoying. Mind you he could have been reciting Shakespeare for all I knew. I could barely understand what he was saying. English subtitles would have definitely helped.In brief this movie could have really worked for me if Mos Def was battered to death by an angry cinema audience early on and Bruce Willis had to carry his body for 16 blocks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>16 Blocks is about a washed up detective who is assigned to transport a witness 16 blocks from the jail house to the courthouse so he can testify against crooked cops. However, the cops involved will stop at nothing to make sure he doesn't get there.16 Blocks is a small film, not really a blockbuster action film. It's more of a character driven drama. The concept of the movie is okay, even though it has been done before in other movies. Richard Donner directs some pretty good action sequences as always. He's really good at directing this kind of film, and he does a good job. I thought that the characters were really engaging. They were characters that you can really get to know. The whole theme of this movie is that people can change, and it plays over well. There are some really good lines too. The script isn't bad.Bruce Willis is alright as the aging cop, but it wasn't his best performance. As for Mos Def, I think Richard Donner could have found a more talented actor for that role. David Morse was probably the best performance in the movie as a crooked cop.Overall, this movie isn't really exciting to sit through, but it's alright for a one time viewing.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Many directors get their start in TV and my contention is that if they don't escape quickly, TV pacing remains with them throughout their career. Such is the case with Richard Donner. His best work has been in the "Lethal Weapon" series, "Superman" and "The Omen", all of which have a made for TV feel. "16 Blocks" is nowhere near the quality of those previous named films and flirts at times with being a total disaster.Bruce Willis is miscast as an aging, drunken, couldn't care less, police detective who's philosophy is that "Life is too long". Willis has long been the poster child for macho actors in need of heroic roles. Sometimes he brings a little dignity ("The Sixth Sense" "Die Hard"), but usually it is just showboating that makes me cringe. How can one man spend his entire career in exceptionally unbelievable situations?What saves this movie from being an absolute waste of time is the immense talent of Mos Def. He runs circles around more experienced actors and is pure joy to watch on screen. His unique speech pattern brings charm to what could have been "just another criminal" character. While I am totally disappointed in the film as a whole, I look forward to more of Mos Def and less of Richard Donner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great throwback to 80's and 70's thrillers. Interesting twist and turns throughout this amazing thriller with the gun scenes being the most subtle elements and the most reoccurring. Mos Def is amazing in this movie being a less known actor he does a great job in his part. Not much dialogue to the movie but it doesn't need it because of great action scenes. Bruce Willis comeback movie. Some scenes left my jaw open on how Bruce and Mos are always avoiding traps and bullets. Definitely the best movie with bad cops of this era and it was funny howthe names of characters are names of writers. I was actually scared in the movie and although it pairs up the two actors this is not a Jackie Chan buddy movie.</fullReview>

These guys are obviously living in a small pond.The plot is interesting take a witness from point A to point B (ie the 16 blocks) but there is trouble in between (the bad cops).The cops are pushing bullets to this kid and he can't stop talking, may be the director wanted this (he obviously has a yapping wife and wanted us to experience it ;-)). Lets give that to the story. Then in one scene Jack lets out all the hostages and still the police wanted to storm the bus. Duh why, he is alone inside. And again this is NewYork when is the news crew. I can go on and on .....I totally understand that its a film, and a film tends to take a few liberties, But this one takes too much of "Cinematic Liberty" Also its not the actors that I'm complaining about, Its the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand how this film got such high marks. It was really boring. The plot sounded exciting enough: a cop tries to escort a witness to a courthouse 16 blocks away to testify at a trial that's set to begin in a couple of hours all the while they are being chased by armed men trying to kill them. Sounds exciting doesn't it? Too bad it wasn't.This film was like a cross between Midnight Run and 48 Hours, except Bruce Willis and Mos Def were not nearly as likable as Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy and their chemistry, well, what chemistry? Anyway, after some introduction of Jack and Eddie (yeah, those were their names in this film, apparently as a homage to the characters in Midnight Run and 48 Hours), the film looked like it was going to take off. Jack picks up Eddie from the halfway house to begin a normally routine journey to the courthouse when they are immediately being shot at just a block away. And now there should be non-stop action from here on out, right? Wrong. With our protagonists under time pressure to make it to the courthouse in time for a trial and guys trying to kill them, we still saw them take time out to chill for a bit here and there. We saw them lingering at Jenna's apartment and then chit-chatting leisurely in the bus. It was tough to get the sense of impending doom for these characters when they did these things. Wasn't there a trial about to happen in a couple of hours? Weren't there guys on their heels trying to kill them?The pacing could've been better. And something else early in the film bothered me. To see Jack turn on his partner of 20 years to protect a criminal he hardly knew in a blink of an eye didn't make sense. We needed to see more of Jack's character and his relationship with his partner so we could believe something like that could happen. We knew nothing of Jack's past and his partner so it was tough be believe he could turn on him.And oh yeah, Bruce was his same smug self and Mos was really annoying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a Bruce Willis fan and only purchased this DVD as it was filmed in Toronto and it was very very cheap.For me, and the only main comment I have is, if he was going to testify against cops, is it really a good idea for cops to be holding him, transporting him to the court for him to testify. Wouldn't he have been sequestered somewhere else like a hotel room or private residence?? Someone in previous comment said that they should have gotten into a cab to take them to the courthouse and been there in less than 10 minutes?yes, I totally agree, except, the closer they got to the court house, do you not think the cops would be checking the cabs including the trunk. I only got 50 minutes into this before I bailed?. Oh so bad, very very bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good entertainment, a bit shaky of a story line, better acting then expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>16 Blocks is a 'beat the clock' film. Jack Mosley has 118 minutes to deliver a police informant who has cut a deal with the D.A. to testify against a group of corrupt detectives and cops. Things become complicated when Jack's ex-partner comes to kill Eddie, the man being escorted, and now must go 16 blocks with Frank and his group of cops chasing after him, all of whom are corrupt and will stop at nothing to keep Eddie quiet.Bruce Willis is a great actor and this is one of his less appreciated roles. I found him to be very intriguing with his virtually silent mood and his many problems. Willis, even with what seems to be fewer lines then usual and far from his comedic role in the Die Hard series. What Willis' character has is not much of a personality and a much darker side to him then shown in the film. I found what he did with his role as Jack to be a top notch performance for a film like this.Mos Def, who plays Eddie, gives, in my opinion, the best performance of his career. He's a non-stop talking kind of person who seems to have little care in the world for anything besides baking and talking. I wasn't expecting Mos Def to do much of anything on screen but when Eddie and Jack began to get hunted his brilliant acting became clear. I found his acting to be a great example of under-appreciated acting in films.The film is heavily under-appreciated which I have trouble finding out why. Yes the plot is a bit shaky. I'm pretty sure corrupt cops who are trying to silence a witness would not be attempting to kill him in broad daylight on the streets of New York City but then again I'm not a cop and I'm not a corrupt one at that. Also some of the shootouts seemed a bit unbelievable especially considering the amount of risk some of the characters put themselves into and how little they care about it.Overall the story was a bit shaky at times but still managed to work. I found Bruce Willis' and Mos Def's performances both very strong. It's an entertaining flick. There is a lot of action and violence which I'm sure a lot of people won't mind seeing. What makes the film a little better then the typical action shoot out film is that you end up caring for some of the characters, such as Eddie. Overall not to much wrong with the film. It's a case of a sub-par story line with good action and good acting around it.3/5 Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A Decent Film, But Doesn't Have Anything In It To Make It Memorable"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Mosley is an aging detective who's seen more downs then ups as of late. As he is about to leave, a senior officer asks for a small favour; help move Eddie Bunker, a witness, to a trial 16 blocks away before 10:00. Sounds easy, but as usual it doesn't end up being that easy. Now Jack and Eddie are on the run from crooked cops and Jack's friend Frank.16 Blocks was a film that seemed to come out of nowhere. There was no hype about it, no talk about it, no ads for it anywhere. It kind of just hit the theatre and left in a blink of an eye. The only reason you ever heard of it was because of the star, Mr. Action himself, Bruce Willis. It wasn't bad enough to make big headlines, but it wasn't good enough either. It was just...there. 16 blocks is one of those films that if you were to ask someone if they had seen it, they would vaguely remember. That's the films main problem, there is nothing in it to make it memorable. It's a by the book film that runs it's running time and gets out of there. The whole film feels like an excuse to have one more project on your resume.Willis does his usual routine here as a cop, the only addition is that he wears some make up to make him look a little bit older. Nothing to complain about in his performance, but nothing to cheer about either. Willis gives a basic performance, for a basic film. The same problem applies to Morse, everything he does in the film, we've seen him to before. Neither actors really give you a reason to want to see the film, other then if you're a fan of their work. Mos Def is the only one who tries to do something different here. Whether it worked or not is up for debate, but he is the only one who puts in the effort. The bad news is that while Def tries to bring new dimension to the character, the fact of the matter remains is that the character is one dimensional and boring at that. Having Willis and Mos Def together didn't really bring anything to the table either. Their chemistry is mediocre at best and can easily be forgotten after the film is over.Donner, much like his actors, directs the film with no passion. It seems he knew what he wanted to do, but either got lazy, or didn't care enough to make it work beyond the means of the film. What we are left with is a film that doesn't try to go further to entertain, but just sees that bar and does as little as possible to reach it. I give Donner props for not having any characters jump through the air holding two guns while cars and buildings blew up in the background, but what he did give us is a by the numbers, restricted action film. I felt bored, but at the same time respected the scene I was watching. It was an odd feeling to say the least.The film has many moments where the scene is showing two different things at once, but is made to have you believe that they are together in one piece. Having this done once is cute, twice is overdone. I can't remember how many times they actually did this, but I'm sure it was more then twice. Which shows a lack of talent on the directors part.Can I recommend 16 Blocks? Sure I can, but it is hard to. What can I tell you that I already haven't? 16 Blocks doesn't try to entertain, it only does cause it has to. Everything that you can find wrong with it, you will. It's hard to tell if it will be entertaining to the mass audience cause viewers today expect so much more out of their films. 16 Blocks doesn't give more and doesn't want to. Everything about it seems rushed and by the numbers. Nothing is overly original and the ending falls into the category of being too predictable. You can tell that the filmmakers had something good to start with and if they had given just a little bit of effort could have walked away with a suspenseful thriller, but too many things were half-hazardously done that we will never know how good it could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taking its cue from Midnight Run, Collateral, Precinct 13 and even The Defiant Ones (amongst others), 16 Blocks tries to be a tense thriller. Both the screenplay and the acting however ensure that it fails.Bruce Willis is sluggish and unconvincing, whilst Mos Def with his constant punch-drunk drawl, annoys from the off. He was OK in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005), so I was surprised by this. David Morse and others did little or nothing to help.Turning to the writing, this extract of poor, illogical and unconvincing dialogue says it all.Eddie Bunker - Hey Jack...Why d'you do that? Jack Mosley - Do what?Eddie Bunker - Shoot that cop! Cops don't shoot other cops...especially over nobody like me. Yes they really said that. How touching. Poor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serious crime thriller derailed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The engine behind the story is a common one. A cop (Bruce Willis) is to pick up a convict (Mos Def) and take him to court to testify in an extortion case. He's given this assignment because he's a washed-up, burned-out boozer of a cop. He discovers, though, that the case involves half a dozen other cops involved in the crime, including his ex partner (David Morse) and the precinct captain. They want to take the witness and dispose of him. Willis acquires a case of conscience and absconds with the witness, intending to deliver him at his appointed hour. (Cf., "The Gauntlet".) The other cops chase him and his prisoner all over town. There are multiple shoot outs and a bus chase through crowded Manhattan streets. Bruce allows Def to slip away, and he testifies himself, dooming the bad cops. All's well because it ends well.Yet the plot, although built along familiar lines, has some odd quirks and even some epileptiform seizures of its own. Whether they're deliberate or unwitting is impossible to tell. For instance, dramatic effectiveness, however shallow, calls for a single bus chase ending with a climactic crash. Instead this chase is interrupted by what appears to be a final crash in media res, and after a longish pause for some gloomy negotiations, the bus takes off again at slow speed, knocking off a dozen external A/C boxes in an alley, crash boom bah, before stopping with its open front door lodged precisely against the open door of what happens to be a building that Willis' sister, who drives an ambulance for the NYFD, shows up at, and -- well, let's say there are some things man was never meant to know nor, apparently, is the viewer.Bruce Willis ought to make a good burned-out cop. God knows he's had enough practice playing loser cops. But there's always been an edge to his performances before. Yipee tay yay. Here, however, he tries to play it straight and it doesn't work well. Compare Al Pacino in "Insomnia." David Morse gives a professionally understated performance as the gum-chewing evil cop.Regardless of plot imperfections or other performances, however, the movie is sunk with all hands by Mos Def. I've seen him in something else in which he did an impressive job. But here he's miscast and is a total disaster in the way his character is written and played. He has the personality of a paper cup. I have no idea what anyone was thinking when they allowed Def to carry on in this whiny non-stop Stepin Fetchit imitation. Sometimes he stops rambling and tries to smile and get a frightened little girl to calm down. A scene that's supposed to make us feel a warm glow and create a more fully fleshed and endearing character leaves you with the impression of an actor trying desperately to be a nice guy, failing to project anything more than the effort involved. It's as fascinating as watching some guy rotate your tires.If you start watching it, you'll probably want to stick around to see how things turn out. (Predictably.) And the director avoids the usual cascades of blood. On the whole, though, you can find better examples of the genre. Try John Cassavetes' early version of "Gloria."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"16 Blocks" gives Richard Donner a chance to do a straighter cop film than the latter-day "Lethal Weapon" movies were.This also lets Bruce Willis have another shot at his Everyman character and have a hero who's closer to "Unbreakable" than "Striking Distance."No Superman he, he's a balding paunchy guy who just wants to go home.Always good to see the Willis who can act rather than smirk.It's a pretty stripped-down storyline, but Donner and writer Richard Wenk give as much emphasis to character as to action.This means it isn't exactly "Die Hard" thrilling all the way through.But it does make the movie somewhat more interesting than it might otherwise have been.Mos Def's witness is irritatingly talkative, but that's the idea.David Morse is terrific as the leader of the bad cops out to stop Clint and Sondra... er, sorry, Bruce and Mos.(Face it, they are running "The Gauntlet.") For fans of '80s TV, it's a kick to realise that this essentially pits David Addison against that nice Dr. Jack Morrison from "St. Elsewhere." And props to the makers for not trying to spring a "surprise" twist on us about his best friend being a baddie, but rather showing it early on.Especially since they save the real twist for much later.It could have been a minor classic had it ended with the bus under siege as set up in the opening, rather than carrying on for about 20 minutes after, and Klaus Badelt's score is dreadful and completely outclassed by the snippet from "Ladyhawke" over the logo for The Donners' Company at the end.But there are worse Richard Donner movies out there, like "Timeline."And worse Bruce Willis cop movies, like the aforementioned "Striking Distance" and "Die Hard With A Vengeance."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is Die Hard 19 without the balls. Richard Donner directed the Lethal Weapon films with abandon, but this one lacks the pace and, in my opinion, interest of the others.It can't work out if it's either a thriller, an action film or a social commentary. There are story threads that would make any one of those interesting, but it still wants to do all of them at the same time.Bruce Willis does what he does. He plays a drunk policeman (sound familiar?) in the wrong time (sound even more familiar?) in the wrong place (if you're reading this and haven't watched Die Hard then go and watch it now!).There are really clever twists and thoughtful turns, but, when push comes to shove, there's nothing better in this film than ones that Bruce has done many times before.And we've seen him in more dire straits than these. There's a semi-obvious plot, but there are also many twists that are still really entertaining.16 blocks is entertaining. There are some wonderful twists and clever turns. I don't know who this 'Mos Def'is, I thought he gave a convincing performance, but I wanted to shoot him through the head throughout for his annoying nasal voice. (And yes, I get that his character is supposed to be a loquacious sidekick). There were times when I was really hoping he would die of his gunshot wounds, just so I wouldn't have to listen to him anymore. That's why I give it a 6. It keeps the pace on and is thoroughly entertaining, but falls short of either an action film or a thriller/drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"16 Blocks" is a run of the mill, by the book "action" film. There are few surprises and the film would be utterly worthless if not for the supporting cast of Mos Def and David Morse.Those two actors bring in performances that light up the screen whenever they are on. Bruce Willis plays a tired, alcoholic, cop who for no apparent reason, decides to do the right thing; so his performance is pretty tired.I don't know where Mos Def went to acting school, but he could probably teach master classes. His character is a small time thief who want to open a bakery, and it is the most likable character in the film. Without him, this film would have been a total bust.The directing is nothing special and I was distracted by the shaky camera work. For an action film, there was not enough action or suspense. The story was pretty predicable.Nonetheless, "16 Blocks" is a decent enough film if you can't find anything else to see.</fullReview>

Very similar plot "A hard but mediocre cop is assigned to escort a prostitute into custody from Las Vegas to Phoenix, so that she can testify in a mob trial. But a lot of people are literally betting that they won't make it into town alive".

Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis), a burnt-out detective assigned the unenviable task of transporting a talkative convict from jail to a courthouse 16 blocks away. However, along the way he learns that this man is supposed to testify against Mosley's colleagues, and the entire NYPD wants him dead. Mosley must choose between loyalty to his colleagues and protecting the witness, and never has such a short distance seemed so long.I appreciate not only Bruce Willis but the director and the whole story as well. The camera angles and the sound effects are also brilliant, for it made a great influence on those explosive action scene. Another remarkable element of this movie was the characterizing of those lead characters.16 Blocks is a wonderful thriller with lots of action, suspense and mild comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>16 stars but i can only go up to 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WOW!, that was what i expected and more. the Richard Donner action and the clever lines plus the beautiful visuals make a movie to be remembered heres the math. RD action + Cool Dialogue + crash from a bus = THE BEST! Richard Donner had made quite a few movies i didn't like in fact i hate all his crap but this, this was art. Mos Def is a nice young star (The Hitchikers Guide To The Galaxy) and he just makes it work, i mean the way he talks you get Chris Rock doing that I'm out of there in 10 minutes (ha 16 minutes i'll shut up) you get Chris Tucker doing that i wont pay to see it if it had nudity. Bruce Willis is god just acting without a care and David Morse putting them in Jeopardy every 5 minutes just keeps you at the edge of your seat without giving you a chance to sit back. But heres the twist i don't like these kind of movies, i only saw it because Mos Def is in it but this right here, This is great i thought all action movies just wanted to show you a cool stunt but the way Richard Donner makes this into a Stunt action with good action and plotting almost makes up for his other so please BUY THIS ON DVD. You will not be disappointed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of Bruce Willis and have enjoyed almost all of his movies. Die hard is an extraordinary movie, but this one lacked that flare. There are a few new additions from ordinary action flicks, but i won't delve deeply into it or no one will ever read my reviews again. Other than those few short instances the movie I think severely drags. It's basically just run away from the bad guys and have a small climax of a showdown in the end. Movies like this make you think you wasted your money in the theater. This one just lacks the greatness that the others obtained. All the critics have given extremely large raves about this movie but I believe the only reason they did it was because Bruce Willis stars in it and he's running out of time until retirement. I'm warning you if you like movies that are not very exciting and develop a plot at an intermediate level then this one is for you. I prefer movies with action and adventure such as the Kill Bill films and the Punisher. This movie severely disappointed me and I think everyone else should know exactly what type of movie it is. I give it 1 out of four stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, I fell victim to a misleading movie trailer, promising action, a compelling plot, and mos def speaking in a seemingly well-versed manner. For the first time in my life, I fell asleep in a movie theater. I woke up to the occasional S.W.A.T. team flash bang or gunshot, but the conversations, stemming from the garbage device, corruption in bureaucracy, lulled me into a peaceful slumber unparalleled in relief. Thanks to hindsight bias, I can safely state how I "knew" this movie was going to be a disaster right from the start, as my eyes burned watching one of my most highly-regarded action heroes engage in one of the worst displays of boredom and senility ever to tarnish the silver screen.The plot centers around an aging cop, married to the badge, who's forced to carry out an assignment as he checks out for the day. This assignment, reflecting the sheer excitement of the film, is to transport a prisoner 16 blocks to his court hearing to testify in a case, slowly unfolding through the progression of the movie. After being attacked by a couple of suspiciously shady carpenters, our protagonist learns that a sinister plot to frame a small-time thief simmers on the brink of execution. The audience is then immersed in a fantastic realm of novel themes in film, such as corruption and morality, as Willis and Def hijack buses, engage in pseudo-philosophical discussions of character, and drink. A lot. There may have been more to this film, but I was probably dreaming about Aishwarya Rai rather than actually watching real plot development or an insight into character. We're given brief insight into an alcoholic who likes things right, and a story about progressing through corruption against all odds, with a physical manifestation (the 16 blocks), just for kicks.If you're like me, then you'll wait for V for Vendetta next week, instead of hastily storming into a theater, hungry for on-screen gore. If you want to watch Garden State with a black dude and a fragmented plot, storm away. But if you're desiring a film with brilliance (a term probably coined by a Miss Karen Kyer), then you've probably typed the wrong title on Google.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wouldn't walk 16 Blocks to see this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>16 Blocks is an average thriller from a director who is capable of much more. Richard Donner has made several great movies, such as Superman, Lethal Weapon, The Goonies and LadyHawke. But with 16 Blocks, he turns in a passable excuse for an action movie that hits all the cliché notes for a film of it's type.Bruce Willis plays Jack Mosley, a New York cop who is on the edge of death, it seems. He has a bum leg, a serious drinking problem and he shuffles around as if he is about to pass out. He has been given a relatively simple assignment by his lieutenant: transport con Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) 16 blocks to attend a Grand Jury session before 10 AM when the session expires. Stopping on the way to the courthouse to buy some booze, Mosley is forced to shoot an individual who is about to shoot Bunker in the car. Mosley quickly realizes what is going on: Bunker is set to testify against a crooked cop, and Mosley's ex-partner, Frank Nugent (David Morse), will see to it that Bunker does not make it to the Grand Jury, because his testimony will take down Nugent and several other dirty cops. Mosley must now protect Bunker from friends and co-workers of his while trying to ensure Bunker makes his court date.16 Blocks is mostly cobbled together from pieces of better movies into a relatively unsatisfying package. You can see where it is going not long into it's running time. There isn't much suspense or surprise in store for you at any point along the way, it's just going through the motions. It doesn't help that the characters are rather thin. There is some back story introduced for both Mosley and Bunker, but nothing that is developed too deeply and that isn't your typical cop movie cliché. Mosley is the cop on the ragged edge trying to do a "good thing." Bunker is your typical fast-talking con who isn't really all that bad, we discover. Nugent is the bad cop who will do anything to stop Bunker from testifying so that they all don't get taken down. There are some occasional moments when the film tries to build some suspense, but all those instances are just too obvious to cause much reaction. The film transforms into an exercise in tedium long before the end credits are in sight. More than once in 16 Block's running time I found myself wondering how much longer this film had to go.Acting-wise, the performers are mostly capable. Bruce Willis makes us believe that Mosley is about two steps away from the grave. How his character manages to regain some of his strength by the end of the film is a bit baffling, but Willis sells his character well, overall. Morse is capable as the bad cop. He manages to project menace without going completely over the top as other actors in similar roles might do. The weak point on the acting front is Mos Def, who is borderline annoying as Eddie Bunker. He uses a voice that is whiny and grating, causing you to begin to hope that he will just keep his mouth shut.16 Blocks isn't a total waste of time, but it isn't much worth recommending either. Hopefully director Donner will live up to his past promise next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong Crime Flick fails in the final quarter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Willis is a has-been cop who gets a tedious assignment escorting Mos Def (amusing here) from county lock-up to the courthouse. Along the way somebody tries to kill Mr. Def, and soon the two of them are running for their lives. Pretty strong crime flick fails terribly in the final quarter due to script problems: Willis reveals at the end that he knows something that, if true, makes the entire picture beforehand meaningless. (He might've done exactly the same things, but for completely different reasons and with different emphases and motivations.) Not every script needs a last-minute twists.Outside of that (and that's a big "outside of that:") this is very entertaining. I've seen reviews and comments that knock Mos Def's performance as mannered and actorly, but I know guys just like him, it's actually quite true to life. Willis has become an excellent actor (albeit one with limited range) and he's in fine form here, completely without vanity, too (his gut's hanging out, he's sweaty, limping, etc.) The two characters bounce up against each other nicely, until the end the theme of redemption and personal transformation is handled reasonably subtly and well, and for most of the movie people behave in a satisfyingly intelligent manner, too.Until the ending. The ending here is really bad, so bad that I can't recommend the movie.</fullReview>

Hostage was OK but Tears of the Sun was a tired remake of the typical war movie with no punch and now 16 Blocks.Let me say this loud and clear. Mos Def's character is freaking annoying.

While that may be good enough to be a top earner I am not going to bother picking this one up at the video store and would love to get my $7.50 admission back.His performance has none of the flair he normally displays and reminded more of Sly Stallone in Cop Town.

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis is very believable, and so is Mos Def, or David Morse, for that matter. The nice twist at the end was a surprise. For a chase movie it kept our attention, the bus stuff was okay although it wasn't totally believable, but the paper on the windows was clever and Willis's sister as a paramedic with control of her own ambulance was quite a piece of deus ex machina. The pacing was good, the bad guys were reasonably bad, and Willis being a flawed character was also a good touch. Mos Def did get on your nerves but just when it seemed too much the scenes changed and he wasn't going on so much any more. Many good screen shots, kudos to cinematography, and the dialogue okay as well, you know, since Pulp Fiction all criminals and cops are always having these long drawn out discussions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mos annoying character ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>16 Blocks would simply have been an average to mediocre action/cop movie if were not for one thing- the incredibly annoying performance given by Mos Def as Eddie Bunker. His performance, mostly his voice, drags this movie down from being a watchable workman like movie into a chore to sit through. His voice sounds like what you would expect one of the South Park guys to come up with if they came with a character who was meant to be an annoying mentally challenged, gay, black heroin addict with a speech impediment. But he isn't played for laughs; worse, I think he is meant to be ultimately endearing and the characters is motor-mouth type who is more or less talking non-stop throughout the movie. Believe me, you'll wish it was Mos Mute and not Mos Def in the role. To make matters worse the character is insipid and badly written- a clichéd nice guy from a bad area who grew up bad but wants to make good if he can get the chance. In this case he wants to start his own cake baking business, which he won't shut up about. Unfortunately the movie is largely centred around this character and his relationship to Jake Mosley (Bruce Willis) so given how irritating and badly written he is and how much screen time he has the movie is pretty much scuppered.Aside from that the movie still isn't particularly good. Willis is going through the motions as a burnt out alcoholic cop who finds himself in the thick of it when he tries to do right thing. He isn't bad but we've seen it all before. The rest of the cast is adequate but no one stands out, even capable actors such as David Morse seem to be sleepwalking. The basic premise is serviceable, even if does get a little silly- these bent cops sure lack subtlety at times. There are a lot weak plot points and dumb bits in 16 Blocks. Most noticeable for me was the scene where the cops shoot out the tires of a speeding public bus full of people in broad daylight- corrupt or not there is no way I can imagine the police, corrupt or otherwise, doing something like that or at least thinking they could get away with it. The police tardiness in raiding the bus after all the hostages are off is another weak point. I would be a little more forgiving of these kind of plot points if the movie were a little more thrilling but the action and suspense sequences are really nothing to write home about- Richard Donner does seem to have lost his touch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>33 years ago in the land of SERPICO and FUZZ, corrupt NY cops and world weary city antics were sort of interesting. Even FORT APACHE THE BRONX in 1980 had something going for it. Today a film like 16 BLOCKS is a waste of time and effort, making it and seeing it. Really, who cares if Bruce Willis is channeling Willy Loman from DEATH OF A SALESMAN (or Gil, the loser salesman from The Simpsons) in some really contrived idea in Copland. What is the market for this? Multiplexes? Teens? Fellers? Beer drinkers? Who? I just thought this dull grimy drivel was dull grimy drivel. Bruce Willis with a gun. Yawn. Corrupt cops he battles against with a jive talking black criminal. Mega yawn. If 16 BLOCKS did not exist I do not believe for a minute anyone would think of it otherwise. It was one dinosaur cliché from grubby cop films after another. I was happiest when I left the theatre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll begin by saying that I thought the movie was well acted. Bruce Willis and Mos Def both did very well. Unfortunately, I couldn't enjoy the movie because there were just too many things a rational person had to ignore to buy into the plot.First, if practically everyone at the station (except Bruce Willis) knew what Mos Def going to do, why didn't they get someone who was in on the plan to take him to the courthouse? Secondly, when did it change from Mos Def testifying against one dirty cop to him testifying about widespread corruption in the precinct? And at what point did Bruce Willis realize Mos Def was going to be testifying against him? Why would IA not be all over this matter, and why would IA let a witness against corruption be held in custody and escorted to grand jury by officers he would be testifying against? Also, why didn't Bruce Willis keep calling the DA, news media, the Mayor's office, the Governor's office, etc.I could go on and on about having to get him to court before the Grand Jury was dismissed, why he didn't tell the hostage negotiator who gave him the cell phone what was going on... it never ends. This storyline was more far-fetched than the Neverending Story. I just thought it was horrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willis at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lethal Weapon" series director Richard Donner and wisecracking action-movie icon Bruce Willis shift down from the high-octane crime film spectacles that made their reputations for a thriller steeped in mortality and redemption. And lots of guns. Willis plays NYPD burnout Jack Mosley, a detective shuffling through his job with equal parts apathy and inebriation. At the end of a long night shift, he's handed the "nothing job" of escorting small-time loser Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) from lock-up to courthouse. The loquacious Eddie actually is the star witness in a grand jury indictment against a corrupt cop that, apparently, could reverberate all the way up the chain of command. And sleepwalking Jack is the patsy in a conspiracy of fatal witness tampering led by his patronizing former partner (David Morse), a coolly duplicitous cop with a Mephistophelian air.It's hardly a new story and Richard Wenk's script doesn't add much to the redemptive drama as Jack is roused from his moral coma and takes on what seems like the entire police force to get his man to the court alive by his 118-minute deadline. The lean plotting, however, discards the cute twists and physics-defying superhuman feats that pepper so many American action films for a more down-to-earth drama. The real-time countdown provides tension and momentum and the physical repercussions of each violent collision gives it a semblance of credibility.Willis is a long way from "Die Hard" here, playing the very vulnerable Jack with desperate determination and a panic barely held in check. And if Willis and Def lack buddy-bonding chemistry, they also discard the cliché of comic friction."16 Blocks" never quite transcends its origins as a high-concept action thriller, but the clean professionalism of Donner's direction, the low-key turn by Willis and the street-level heroics make it a satisfying piece of genre film-making.Those looking for another "Lethal Weapon" franchise from Donner won't find it: There's no room left for a sequel here, just an ending that feels satisfying and right.While "16 Blocks" may not last much past the month, it stands above much of what we've been offered this season. Hiding among all the uniforms and bullets, it turns out, is an actors' movie, and two actors more than capable of hitting their marks.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard that Richard Donner ( famous for "Superman" , "Lethal weapon" and "Goonies" ) went from one studio to another pleading for a chance to direct a movie . Finally somebody gave him a chance and "16 blocks" was made.This movie is a remake of "The Gauntlet" with Clint Eastwood . The change is that the movie takes place in modern times and the witness is a black guy instead of woman.Bruce Willis is great as the drunk cop . He REALLY looks like his barely standing on legs and like a guy tired of life . On other side his got experience playing all those outsiders that don't want to , but will always do the right thing. David Morse ("The Green mile") , an experienced actor is also good in the supporting role of cop.The problem ? Mos Def. He's annoying . VERY ANNOYING . He talks a LOT , mostly dumb things . He's got a incredibly whiny voice . HE CAN'T ACT . I loved Sandra Lock in original movie . Here Def does a lot to make the audience hate his character and he succeeds . The movie tries to give him some depth , but seriously all this crap about signs and his dream is just laughable.The screenplay is terribly predictable . You can see most of the twists from miles away . Sometimes a miracles happen just to help our heroes move along . Those are the "signs" that Mos Def talks constantly . Signs that screenwriter exists.The movie is also badly directed . Action scenes are lame and the movie is photographed on constant close-up. It's very tiring after a while and distracting.Better watch the original with Eastwood . I give this one a 4/10.</fullReview>

It also doesn't change the fact, that R. Donner has done a good job tying the plot together and bringing out another good performance from Mr. Bruce Willis.Nevertheless, there are some flaws and the movie tends to be a bit cliché from time to time. While I love the fact, that Donner and his scripting partner treat the viewer as an adult person (not everything is spelled out but rather shown, with looks and or cuts to items), the story here and the redemption within isn't something new.

		<shortDescription>Great script and potential, poor execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie, but I was disappointed with various aspects.1. The opening scene where Mosley is asked to attend to the crime scene? Is this realistic? Let alone for a cop with alcohol issues. Also this period should have been used to give a back story and some character development.2. Bruce Willis acting drunk. I feel it was overacted and I could tell he was playing a drunken cop without the need for the drink bottle(s). The first time we should have seen the booze is where he stops at the shop to make a purchase.2.1 In my experience of people with alcohol issues, certainly to the extent of drunkenness displayed by Willis are self conscious. For example the subway scene where he is trying to explain that he can "do this" he should be making up excuses or he could randomly breakdown into tears etc.2.2 He should have had more difficulty finding the key. The camera angle could have been used to show they key, but Mosley fail to find it and perhaps try and break down the door unsuccessfully before Mos Def finds the key.2.3 Again considering how intoxicated Mosley was supposed to be and the extent of his drinking issues his house should have been a mess making it difficult to find the gun.3. Mos Def's acting is excellent here, but he doesn't find the right balance and the accent is annoying. Perhaps this aspect could of been improved with a higher calibre actor.4. A few of the scenes don't blend well into the film. The scene where he handcuffs the cop in his house adds no tension or surprise. The room 5e doesn't really explain how Morse knew exactly where to be when they were leaving.5. THE ENDING(S) there's too many of them! Its almost as if the filmmakers couldn't decide which direction to go in so they merged them all together. The hostage negotiation scene is wasted. Mosley should have been frantically explaining over the phone what had happened only to find either the hostage negotiator doesn't believe him and refers to his alcohol issues or perhaps reveals he is part of the conspiracy and Mosley being a drunk. A different tone of delivering this message.6. Overall the film doesn't convey the message that people can change very well and because of the inconsistent measure of drunkenness acted by Willis its difficult to imagine him being one of the dirty cops. The lack of chemistry doesn't help. I can't help comparing this to De Nero/Pacino.7. Can you count how many times i've referred to alcohol. The should of been a smaller plot device or required a much better performance to carry this off.... I am a fan of John McClane :)</fullReview>

However, the story goes full circle and the viewer sees why Willis' character is the way he is! (burnt-out) What drives the film forward is the great supporting acting of David Morse as the pragmatic dirty cop. The dialogue between Morse and Willis develop the protagonist somber/brunt out character development for the film's conclusion. The film answers the question can people change? The answer is yes for the convict Willis must move to the courthouse becomes a baker, and Willis comes clean as a cop. The riddle in the film who do you save the grandma, girlfriend, or best friend (hero) who saves your life is answered. You save the hero. I believe the answer of the question goes this way if you save grandma you are sentimental. If you save the hero, you are a practical thinker. If you save your love, you are an emotional person. I believe the film is about doing the practical right thing over the sentimental or emotional thing. Good thesis, the film is okay to. I give 16 blocks 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story on first sight seemed to me like a classic Bruno type film, however, if i dug deeper and fully realised the films intention, it seemed like this time the director Richard Donner didn't want to make Bruno look like a cartoon hero which he in most cases has been (5th Element, Die Hard, Armageddon etc.). I know 16 Blocks isn't Bruno's latest film, but at least in this case it feels like it is, because he looks 10 years older than he actually is and that's to say the very least, I mean receding hairline, complete with a moustache, that looks like it is going to fall off at any moment and feels like it came straight from Kevin Kline in "The Pink Panther" which really isn't a good sign. But I'm not saying that it's a bad thing, no, it actually makes the character look like he could actually exist in real life, and I'm pretty sure there's a cop in NY just like the character, only without the ability to use different makeup artists after each scene, they did a good job, I'll give them that, but they should have at least tried to keep the make-up persistent, but no, it changes from no make-up, obviously for close-ups, to a pensioner who has missed his notice of retirement and is now running the streets and his fellow cops are desperately trying to explain the situation to him. Apart from the problems in the film crew Bruno himself used his well-known bored and annoyed face throughout the film, and didn't really put any effort towards making the film into something special. I mean he had no lines where he would have made his classic remarks or action sequences, i mean the 10-minute-killing-sprees, which he usually pulls off with ease. Even in Armageddon where he was supposed to be a cold earth digger, the script office managed to put in some "Die Hardish" jokes for Bruno, but this time there was nothing to even bring a smug smile to my face. That's odd, or at least that's what i thought when i finished watching the film, but after it all had settled in i had a crazy thought, maybe the intention was to bring out Mos Def as an actor, if that was the case in my opinion they failed even more on this end, i mean, the abnormally whiny voice that he was supposed to have in the film obviously seemed fine for Mr. Donner, but it got really annoying after the first few scenes. The only thing Mos did good was the part where he held a gun on Mr. Morse's neck, that's where his Brooklyn origin really shined through, before - and after that he just didn't act like he had been just locked up for weapon possession. OK, he was supposed to be a man who is really trying to change his ways, but that's nothing special, people try and fail changing themselves every day, and a whiny voice, believing everything is a sign and opening a bakery just doesn't make his act believable. After going through the film with a raised eyebrow i thought, well, the ending just can't bring any sense into all this and I'm afraid that it really didn't make any difference ? OK, Bruno smiled at the end, but I'm not falling for that trick, and it was one of the corniest ending to a film i have seen for a long time. "They lived happily ever after" - that sort of stuff. I'll call it "nothing special" and move on to more important things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt about it, Bruce Willis isn't the same wise-cracking all-action hero he used to be. Now in his fifties, it is becoming harder and harder for him to pass himself off as the invincible good guy he used to be. Of course, he hasn't done bad for himself given that he started off working behind bars in New York but sometimes, you see him in a movie and he comes across as nothing more than a bartender - I'm thinking primarily about "Color Of Night", a film so bad that I almost couldn't forgive him. While this film isn't anywhere near as bad as that, "16 Blocks" is a perfectly acceptable thriller that does what it can with clearly limited resources.Willis plays Jack Mosley, a run-down alcoholic cop that nobody seems to have any time for - including himself. Due to finish his shift, he is assigned a dead-end job by his superior to escort an anonymous criminal called Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) from the jail-house to the courthouse sixteen blocks away. He has to testify to a grand jury in a little under two hours but after an apparent assassination attempt, it soon appears that this is a little more complicated than it looks. Jack discovers that Eddie is due to testify against a number of corrupt cops, including Jack's former partner Frank Nugent (David Morse). Can they get to the courthouse in time and intact?Sounds simple and in many respects, it is. It's a straight-up, no excuses action film which offers a tense and thrilling ride through New York's seedy underground from the director of the "Lethal Weapon" films. But for some reason, it's not quite that simple. The story meanders quite a bit and there are moments when the tension does seem to slacken a little. Having said that, the action is impressive (as you'd expect from a veteran action director) and the acting is... well, competent. Willis and Def are OK but neither seem particularly engaging. Morse, however, is brilliant as the dark and shadowy cop with a past he's desperate to keep secret. And while the story is almost insultingly simple, there is a slight twist at the end which makes "16 Blocks" more than the sum of its parts. It isn't a big film with big explosions and big actors (besides Willis, anyway) but it doesn't need to be.I can honestly say that I wasn't expecting much from this but it took me by surprise. It's not hugely fantastic but so long as you don't expect too much, it will do everything you ask of it. It's a great blokes' film, perfect for a rental night in with your mates and a few beers. OK, so it's not "The Godfather" but it never pretends to be. It won't light up Willis's CV but it is a perfectly acceptable action film with just enough to keep casual viewers entertained. Nothing special, nothing exceptional, nothing worth getting too excited over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis can be the surprise in this film ,and Mos Def too,they booth acting very well,maybe the show is not enough,but this film is rather a drama,like an action film.Richard Donner is a very good and talented director.(I think the first Superman film was very very good).The screenplay sometimes can sell us the used elements like they are fresh.Against this the situation about the cop and the black criminal man (who wants to change hi's life,want to became mister good American)is very very old,or used.The bad gay now is David Morse,and he is very good I think.It's sure this film of the director Richard Donner ,will not as famous as Superman ,or Lethal Weapon series,but still enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good story, good action, fairly deft twists from the writer. However, Mos Def's vocal aberrations are a serious detriment. His character's voice is almost unintelligible, especially in the opening scenes; so much so as to distract the viewer from the developing story (my viewing companion,my wife left the room and did not return. On the whole, her loss). If this actor has a speech handicap, then I apologize; if he doesn't, then the director should apologize for allowing him to impose that voice on the audience. Almost ruined a good yarn. Willis is just fine as the fading, sorry-for-what-I've-done and give-me-another-drink cop. David Morse is excellent as the head of the dirty cop squad and he brings the same implacable quality that we see in his role in "House". Of course one is required to suspend an unusual degree of disbelief during some of the chase scenes - but so what? Suspend it and buy-in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where Jack Mosley discovers that letting go is easier said than done...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is 101 minutes of convoluted action with half a dozen shoot-outs, multiple car crashes (with some truly daring and finely timed stunts), an unrelenting foot chase through the crowded streets of New York City, a hostage situation, and multiple surprises and twists that keep the viewer engrossed even in some of the quieter moments ? of which there aren't many, anyway.Which all adds up to a top-notch action-thriller that Bruce Willis fans will just lap up, myself included.This is the basic story: Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis) is a run-down, aging, over-weight near-alcoholic cop who's nearly always given the menial or dirty jobs to do; he's been a low level detective for twenty years, and it shows -- with his jaded looks, grubby clothes, unshaven appearance and a general don't-give-a-damn attitude to all and sundry. This is a cop at the end of his rope, and time on the job...So, he's ordered to ferry a witness to the Grand Jury courthouse that's sixteen blocks from his precinct. Protesting, but resigned, he sets off with his overly garrulous witness Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) at just after 8 a.m. The appointment at the courthouse is for ten ? plenty of time, he thinks, even contending with morning traffic in the Big Apple.Poor Jack, however, has more than traffic to contend with: there's eight of New York's finest out to kill the witness before he gets Eddie to said courthouse because Eddie is about to give incriminating evidence about one of them and that evidence will take them all down.There are a number of themes running through this narrative but the most important one is that of loyalty. When Jack finds out that there are eight of his buddies ready to kill him and the witness, he's gotta ask himself some questions, right? And, who's telling the truth in this situation: motor-mouth Eddie or Frank (David Morse, who gives the image of affability a new twist while he desperately tries to stop Jack's run), Jack's one-time partner and colleague from way back when? Frank's such a nice guy ? how could he possibly want to see Jack dead?The biggest question, for the viewer of course, is: will Jack deliver the goods (the goods being Eddie, that is) to the Grand Jury before 10 a.m.? Well, that's what had me on the edge, naturally, but I'll leave you to see the movie to find out ? and savor the surprise I felt when I learned the truth.Never mind the big holes in the narrative (and there are a few) ? just concentrate on the action and Jack's seemingly impossible task to beat the odds. Having said that, you may like to know that there are two endings: the one that all cinema-goers saw, and the one I also saw on DVD. I'm still mentally debating which one I liked better...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only for Willis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This trite, formulaic, derivative movie is worth watching ONCE because Richard Donner is a pretty good director (even if some may have doubted he still had the chops after the atrocious "Timeline"), and Bruce Willis, in my eyes, is watchable in just about anything. His role here of Jack Mosley, a world weary aging cop being no exception. What sinks the film is Mos Def as a recovering crack head convict that Jack has to transport the titular 16 blocks. His voice and mannerisms are pretty damn annoying throughout and sadly drags the film down exponentially. And as I said before writer Richard Wenk's script is extremely derivative which hinders the movie as well. For your Bruce fix watch the superior "Hostage". For a similar, yet VERY superior film, watch the Clint Eastwood classic "The Gauntlet".DVD Extras: Deleted scenes with intros &amp; commentary by Donner and Wenk; Alternate ending; &amp; Theatrical trailer My grade: D+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So i just saw a screening of this movie, and my first thought that struck me was its similarity to Phonebooth. In a way, I would say I was right. This movie was exactly what I expected it to be. Both movies lack a deep plot and the title pretty much sums up the movie. So, if you lack movies that don't require a lot of thinking, this is the movie for you. The movie isn't entirely brainless however. Bruce Willis does a nice job as the head hero and there is good screen chemistry that develops between him and Mos Def. So, if your looking for a film with some interesting twists and action, but very little plot, then this is the movie for you. Because the storyline was poor, I give the movie a 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth the trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Willis has always, in my mind at least, kicked an absurd amount of ass. Just when I thought he was getting to old to keep kicking ass and taking names, lo and behold he stars in Sin City, a movie in which he beats a man's brains into the floor. Yes, Bruce still kicks ass, and I'm going to keep on watching Bruce do his thing. So of course I'd see any movie that this man is even remotely attached to. 16 Blocks just happens to be the most recent addition to that list. Does Bruce keep on his ass-kicking streak? Willis plays worn-out alcoholic cop Jock Mosley, who is given the assignment of transporting witness Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) to the courthouse before the jury lets out at ten o'clock, two hours from when he leaves. The problem is that Eddie happens to be testifying against a dirty cop and certain individuals are looking to protect their interests, which means taking Eddie out. It just so happens that this is just the incentive Mosley needs to get back on his feet and do his job right for the first time in ages.Yeah, the fact that a worn-out and half drunk cop could take on this many cops is fairly unbelievable, but that's really the least of the plot's problems. There seem to numerous amounts of outs that Mosley could have taken to warn the good cops or the court he is transporting Eddie to. When it does finally pull something quite smart and dramatically well done, it decides to completely betray that little bit of ingenious, dragging on for another half hour past when it should have ended (you'll recognize where it should have ended as where the flash-forward in the first scene takes place).For an action movie, the action really isn't all that good. Mostly, it is shots of Bruce Willis shooting at dirty cops yet never hitting one. How this movie manages to remain interesting with a body count of almost zero is thanks to the scenes between Mosley and Frank Nugent (Morse), Mosley's ex-partner and leader of the group out to kill Bunker. The tension present within Mosley shows itself brilliantly there, and makes the movie worthwhile from that perspective solely.Willis is more than up to the task of playing a person this conflicted, and even without saying all that much gets his point across by looking at his face. Mos Def may well be the most annoying person on the face of the Earth in this movie, but it is exactly what the role called for and he breezes through it. The true standout here is David Morse, who is so good that you sometimes end up rooting for him over Willis on many occasions, which truly marks a good villain (in this case anyways).Despite good acting and good directing, 16 Blocks still ends up as a lame-duck action movie. There is a decent basis, but it ends up doing itself injustice with fairly boring action sequences and a weak final third. Still, not all is lost thanks to the great scenes between Morse and Willis, so if that alone interests you, this one may well be worth a rental on video. Other than that, avoid it. It's not a disaster, but it too mediocre to recommend.Overall Rating ? 58%</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this film would be one of the best films this year, with Bruce Willis (jack) and mos def (Eddie) as the main characters, it was already promising.Even though the plot and the script is fairly good, a lot of other factors makes this film a mediocre one. For example the annoying camera angles, the hand-held camera-movement ruined the film-feeling for me, I often felt like I was watching the "behind the scenes/how the film was made" instead of getting the feeling of being IN the film. I can also add that the nasal voice Eddie has (mos def) really gets on your nerves throughout the film.At the end of the day, it's a film with good acting-performances, but it doesn't really engage you. If you are a big fan of Bruce Willis its worth watching though. Other than that, not highly recommended.</fullReview>

I want my money back! When I go to a movie I want to see something new. I never go to re-makes, I usually wait and rent the DVD. The only reason I gave this a 2 and not a 1 is the performances of Bruce Willis and Mos Def. Even the most stellar performances can't overcome the feeling of being ripped off when I paid to watch this. I wonder if Michael Butler and Dennis Shryack are upset about this plot theft? If you have seen the Gauntlet and don't like re-makes, then this movie is definitely not for you. Wait for the DVD or TV release.

		<shortDescription>Why didn't Mosley hail a cab?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like all good action flicks, 16 Blocks requires steadfast suspension of disbelief. If you can achieve this, it's a great ride delivered by professionals --- with the exception of amateur actor Mos Def, who has the most annoying voice on earth and the worst delivery, so bad that it was hardly worth Mr Wenk writing his lines for him. However, if you're suspending that disbelief, Def's amateurish acting fits his ill-defined role in the flick. Of course, you also have to have failed to notice David Morse playing the identical twisted role in a dozen other pictures but, hey, that's okay, he does it well. Bruce Willis carries the picture effortlessly as a corrupt cop who gets the chance to go straight. If your disbelief suspension falters, you will find yourself wondering: why the heck doesn't Detective Mosley hail a cab and phone the court sheriffs for witness protection? I guess there wouldn't be a story then, and the big climax with 40 people on a bus would be silly nonsense. It is, but it doesn't matter. Heaven knows how much it cost to set this movie in New York, which used to charge legendary amounts for the privilege, but 16 Blocks is worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Die hard as an old manImagine John McCain as an old drunk with a pot belly and you have it...another Die hard movie, Die Hard as an Old Man. It's the same plot line that's as thin as Bruce's hair line. The same improbable escapes while mortally wounded, exhausted, cornered, and on and on, with the same plot holes (they're cops with other cops all over the force on their side and they know where he is going, but need to surround him rather than just calling ahead and having other cops cut him off...Not to mention his being surrounded and always miraculously escaping). It's just the same old movie we've seen 100 times before...And I like it anyway. Obviously I have issues. :) The surprise is Mos Def. A man with a name that sounds like something out of Star Wars does a great job of acting here. He gives a performance that is older than himself, with an ageless quality. But after a while it started to remind me of those old movies of the 40s with the black guy following the white guy around to add comic relief. Only with better grammar than the guys in those old movies.Maybe it's like a fairy tale. You keep hearing it over and over again, but you enjoy hearing it again and again. And maybe this story of John McCain/Jack Mosley or whatever his name will be in the next movie of the same plot, the not-always-so-good guy finally doing the right thing and finding grace in life is a sort of fairy tale. Maybe we like it and keep watching it because it's our story, too, knowing that we're failed human beings and hoping we will do right and help to make things right for others in the end. Maybe it's a good story to hear and tell over and over, about the possibility of change. Maybe it's a good story for a birthday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"16 Blocks" isn't masterpiece of movie, it is just one ordinary thriller with few exceptions. What makes those exceptions are actors. First, Bruce Willis. I think he was great because he changed his way of acting. He is not some super cop in this movie and he doesn't do any extraordinary things. He plays cop who is also alcoholic, without any condition, only with brains. This role is very different from what Willis used to play (Die Hard series and all those movies where he's in top condition and he rules the movie). Here Willis lets other actors to shine. Mos Def definitely surprised me. Maybe this is the best raper-actor role (I liked Eminem but he acted about his life and that isn't hard). Mos Def shows us great range of emotions and also I don't want to forget David Morse, who is great supporting actor. This movie has action, suspense, good actors and solid director (Richard Donner); and it doesn't top to be the best action movie. It is simply one very good story turned into OK movie with few very good roles. The only thing I didn't like is the ending. But hey, this is movie not real life.</fullReview>

Unlike most action movies, this action film is character driven yet it has enough action to satisfy you.I think I'm being lenient on this movie because I'm feeling good. Why? The movie had me feeling good when it ended. There are a lot of plot holes in here but I slightly didn't mind them. It's a movie right? It's called movie magic, as they say.What I also like about this movie are the ingenious attempts of some action scenes. Some went over my expectations and some didn't. The clichés are here and boy, there are many, but I didn't care. I don't know why. By the end of the movie, you just feel happy.

Add in the fact that Mos Def was quite annoying and I began to wonder how the movie got such good ratings.I realized early enough that I would have to put reality aside for this movie and just enjoy the ride. I was amazed at how Bruce Willis was transformed into such a miserable shell of a character on screen. Mos Def's character eventually grew on me and actually became lovable."16 Blocks" turned out to be a good movie with a great message - You can rise above adversity in life and become successful. I remember reading about the late Recording Artist Barry White as a kid and how he was once a gang member before he turned his life around and his talent was allowed to shine through.The successful, feel good ending and the closing credits with Barry White singing brought a tear to my eye and sent chills up my spine.

		<fullReview>16 blocks is a fast paced feature film, loaded with action, I found this film to be average for Bruce Willis, I was not entirely convinced in his role as a corrupt cop, but I think the film is overall; acceptable. Unfortunately this film is the kind of move that you will forget I had to watch it twice before I could write this review, I'm not trying to be critical but it just wasn't the type of film that catches ones attention. I would say this is a good film if you want raw fast paced action. The plot seems to be fair but I would have to question why cops would fight each other with guns, shooting up bars, cars and anything else that got in their way of attaining their goals. This film reminded me of the Clint Eastwood film with the same basic plot line (The Gauntlet, 1977).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A depressed cop with a midlife crisis ( Bruce Willis ) has the task to transfer a con ( Mos Def ) to another prison. During the ride they are attacked by a group led by the police force, with the intention to stop the criminal from lacking information on their dubious methods of working. Since Die Hard we all know that it is a bad idea to start a fight with Bruce Willis. He'll grab his guns and will shoot everyone and everything that comes in his way. And that's pretty much the thing he does in this movie.That being said, I must add that there is a sensitive side to this piece of film. Before the exploding things, nasty firefights and violence starts, the main focus of the movie is on the relationship between cop and criminal. Mos Def is excellent as the annoying bugger, maddening the character of Willis with his endless talking and positive thinking. When the action part starts, you like these two men, opposite as they are. You don't want to see either of them getting killed. You want to give Mos Def another chance in life, starting his own bakery. And you want Willis to overcome his negative spiral of self-destruction. And that's the strength of this movie; though it is just another action-movie, it does have some emotional, psychological touch with the audience. Something that a lot of movies in the action genre seem to forget...It reminded me of the original '' assault on precinct 13 '', and that sure is a good thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the "Picnic at Hanging Rock" incident last week, anything was gonna satisfy me not containing teenage girls playing about on a mountain."16 Blocks" is the story of a cop who is asked to take a witness to court just 16 blocks away. This simple task soon goes horribly wrong when it's evident some people don't want him to get to court. It turns out the witness is heading off to testify against some cops. Mosley (Willis), the cop given the task,is worn out and fed up with his job,but soon regains some spunk and decides to do all he can to save the witness while he's being pursued by some co-workers, most notably Nugent (David Morse, one of my favourite actors ever).The movie keeps moving along, has some non-obvious twists and is reasonably fresh for a genre that's been done to death. Pretty much every time I predicted to wifey what I thought was going to happen, it didn't occur, which is pretty refreshing, especially in light of the recent episodes of "24".

Some cops are not as honest as they should be and when an eyewitness now in custody is scheduled to give evidence against them he must be silenced at all costs. A tired old cop Jack Mosley who has turned to alcohol reluctantly accepts the job of transporting the eyewitness Eddie Bunker to the court-house 16 blocks away.When the cop stops his car in order to lift his spirits at a bar, the prisoner is left unattended which gives the pursuing police an excellent opportunity of killing him.Fortunately for the prisoner Jack returns just in time to fell the policeman with a single shot. After that incident the chase is on for both Eddie and Jack as they race on foot towards the courthouse.It seemed strange to me that the prisoner was not shackled or restrained in any way but ran side by side with the cop along the busy street choked with traffic. Every possible trick was used by the film writers to enhance the excitement of the chase. The cop and the prisoner were darting to and fro through buildings and alley ways, but the pursuing police seemed to know at any moment exactly where to find them. The chase was so long it was starting to get a bit boring. One can stand only so much noise and confusion.From time to time the cop and Eddie who happens to continually ask many questions exchange views about the future. The prisoner believes you can make changes to your life and he says it has always been his dream to open a bakery where birthday cakes etc can be made. From that point on it is predictable that a cake will appear somewhere towards the end of the story. As for the cop who is indeed in a rut believes that nothing is ever likely to change.To give some light relief to the chase the screen writer introduces a growing respect between the cop and the prisoner. It is certainly a change from the noisy confusion of the relentless chase. When analysed there is not much story in the whole script. I'm glad it was only 16 blocks. Another four would have been just too much to take..Yes, I was right about the birthday cake. It was a huge one with a myriad of candles. It is said that you know when you are getting old when the candles cost more than the cake. Happy Birthday, Jack!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whew! That was a long 16 blocks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An over the hill cop with skeletons in his closet has the seemingly simple task of taking a witness from a precinct to a courthouse. Should be easy enough for a cop close to retirement and not trying to get into too much. Right? Wrong. It was an adventurous and time consuming 16 blocks of travel, and in that 16 block journey Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis) had to face some serious demons and make a monumental decision. Mos Def plays Eddie Bunker, the witness. Mos Def is certainly moving up in the world of Hollywood. After a magnificent performance in the HBO original "Something the Lord Made", Mos Def did a decent job in "16 Blocks" as well. This movie offered some suspense and drama. The drama primarily came from Mosley's internal and external struggle with his past. It is a good movie with an imperfect protagonist trying to make things right: a man you can get behind wholeheartedly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great movie. Bruce Willis played a burned out boozer. His only job was to get a black witness from jail to the courthouse. He played his character well. The movie was VERY unrealistic though in terms of how much the cops were trying to kill the witness. I have to say, I wish they would have used Ludicrus as the witness instead of MOS DEF. Mos Def was the most annoying "side kick" ever! I am not exaggerating. This was absurd! He constantly talked, even in the old Chinese man's apartment. It was funny when Bruce Willis thought he could go drink some booze during a fast drive to the courthouse at the beginning. David Morse has aged and delivered the goods as usual. I suggest THIS movie to fans of DIE HARD!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very, very decent action film, really.I knew I was going to like this movie in the first two minutes when the cat has its appearance on the couch. Any action movie starting with a cat starring as itself curled up on a couch is a success for sure. And I wasn't mistaken.The plot certainly is simple - Bruce Willis starring as a worn out police officer has to get Mos Def starring as a chatty witness supposed to testify against very bad and mean policemen to a court room which is only 16 blocks away. Full stop. It turns out to be quite a distance.Still, I was surprised to find that it worked out so well.Mos Def chats all along, and Bruce Willis is the silent not-so-super hero, that is the division of tasks and also this works well. You may argue that both characters do no acting but are just themselves, but then again, why bother, they fit nicely into this story.With several chases with and without cars, and several twists and turns in the plot (none to make you jump and shout, but still some twisties), the storyline had my full attention all the way.Also credits to David Morse, he did fine.This is not a thriller, and not a drama. If you expect nothing else but classical features of an action movie (good v. bad, a chase, good wins at the end, some laughs, some explosions and some stunts), you shall not be disappointed here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Wished Mos Def Was Mos Def Mute. Did He Ever Shut Up?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that really ticked me off about this movie the most was not the fact that it was a complete knockoff of 48 Hours, not the fact that Bruce Willis is constantly being typecast as a disgruntled old cop (despite not looking that old to begin with), but Mos Def's character. Don't get me wrong, I like Mos Def. He's a great rap artist, and he was good in movies such as "Bamboozled" and "Something The Lord Made". In this movie, it seemed as though his character was intended only for comic relief. Mos Def may be a good actor, but he's not very funny in this movie.His character just kept talking and talking, and the problem with that is you're supposed to want this guy not to get killed. That's the whole plot of the movie. Mos Def is supposed to get transported 16 Blocks without getting killed. Since I really hated Mos Def's character, I really didn't care if he got killed, thereby making the film not so thrilling to me. There were some good plot twists, but Mos Def's character and his "blah blah blah" personality ruined it for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remember "The Gauntlet"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life and death situations are always common in life. When a New York cop(Bruce Willis) and a con(Mos Def) are schedule to go to court, they get blind-sided by assassins from every direction. Mob hit men and rogue cops seems to try to prevent someone from telling something. The duo must rely on each other to stay alive, and bring whoever responsible to justice. The culprits are the cop's partner(David Morse), the captain, and several others. He says he was also responsible, but during the situation there, he decides to get wise. The con is also a talent baker, and he always like to keep him promises to people who help him. And he does. The cop had an issue on birthdays, anyone would when they get older. So when they took a picture of him with the picture of the ex-con, he knows that will be a keeper, for life. Perhaps one day, he'll go out to the West Coast, and check on his progress as a baker. That cop won't be a poor man when he go into retirement. The scenes of the movie reminds me of the 1977 cop movie "The Gauntlet" only with a twist. East Coast, fewer cops, and total trust from outsiders. Not as much bloodshed though, yet the movie has star power. Warner Bros. really outdid themselves in this movie. Great! 4 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought 16 Blocks was a great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My neighbor gave me two movies to watch..Al Gore's film on the environment and 16 Blocks. 16 Blocks, belongs on par with Scorcese's "The Departed." Wow! I didn't get 16 Blocks the first time I watched it, (not paying attention; on my PC) but when I took my time and paid attention, what a film. Oh, yeh...see Inconvenient Truth too. Mos Def was good-and Bruce Willis is maturing nicely into roles. Remember in younger roles he played sort of the dysfunctional, rouge, offbeat, always in trouble kind of cop? In this he played the 'older' cop whom was sort of reaping what he sowed you know in later years in life; his motto was 'life is too long'. He was burnt out, sort of a walking shell of a man, guilt ridden from bad things he had done as a policeman- and Mos Def's character bought back the cop in him from Die Hard, but older now..lol..that was my take anyway.I liked the journey of 16 blocks that they took us of character development. Bruce's character (Mosley) is hanging on by a string, yet the positive thinking Mos Def's character (Eddie) no-doubt has Mosley do things he long ago gave up on. At one point in the film Eddie says, to Mosley after evading the bad guys, "Mosley, What did that cop mean when he said to you, 'Why don't you just do what you always do.?' Mosley this isn't what you always do is it?" Eddie was referring to Mosley's attempts to save Eddie's life.I thought this was a great choice for Willis-and it was brave of him to take this vain-less role of the old injured cop. Bruce can act! He shows us in this film, with his conflicted emotions toward fellow police officers he's know for years and compassion he shows for a the kid Eddie whom he knows for 3 hours. Watch this film-you won't be disappointed-you will want it for your DVD collection. jjanrae</fullReview>

Since 9/11, so many movies have focused on the heroism of the NYPD, which obviously many deserve...

Although the witness was at times illegible, I found the movie highly entertaining.

		<fullReview>I can be a very harsh critic when it comes to film. However I thought that "16 Blocks" was a really good film I think more than anything I was geared towards the message in the film. I think it was very positive and I think that the public needs to see more of it. I also thought that the action in the film was good also. I thought i carried a very basic storyline, but yet left room for a little creativity and additional suspense. I thought that the characters were well written. My favorite in the whole film was " Frank Nugent". I thought that David Morse did an excellent Job in playing Frank Nugent. Talk about a classic bad guy, wearing a good guy mask. Bruce willis,and Mos Def also did well. I thought that it was a few funny parts in it too. A good action packed film, that makes you feel all foofy inside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's got a great storyline, great acting, and the twists revealed were timed perfectly. Yes, Mos Def has an annoying voice, but that aside, all the actors were great!!! Wonderful!!! I can't believe this movie didn't get that popular. Bravo!!!At first I thought, Wow this movie is going to be CRAP, so I just popped it into my DVD player as background noise, only glancing up every few minutes or so. (I really only got the movie because my favorite actor, David Morse is in the film.) But in the beginning after Mosely fired at the man standing at the window of the squad car, I was hooked into it. We're lead to believe this man is a completely washed-out drunk loser cop with almost no motor skills, and in the blink of an eye, he's got a pistol drawn and he takes this guy out. I almost spilled my coffee all over my laptop, it was such a shock!!! I quickly then rewound the movie, turned off all the lights in the house and glued myself to the tube. It was worth it. I even found myself tearing up when Eddie was talking to the little girl in the bus. Maybe not Academy Award material, but definitely worthy of a round of applause for all involved!!!David, you're my hero. Even when you play a bad guy.~Katie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We've seen it all before...but it's good enough to see again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films like this one are a penny a dozen, but they sometimes offer something in the way of entertainment - and Richard Donner - director of the likes of the Lethal Weapon films and Superman, certainly knows his way around an action flick. The main problem with this one, however, is that it's just too corny, and for some reason the director has decided to put more emphasis on the characters rather than the action sequences, meaning as an action film it's not particularly thrilling; and as a character study, it's all a little bit too silly to really be taken seriously. Thus...the film misses both of its intended targets. The plot focuses on weary copper Jack Mosley, who is just about to go home one day when the lieutenant asks him to do one little thing; namely, transport a witness 16 blocks from a police station to a courthouse. However, they soon come under attack from a group of armed assassins, and after finding out the witness is planning to testify against fellow policeman, Mosely decides to battle through his fellow cops and get the witness to the courthouse.It's easy to call this film a Bruce Willis vehicle, as that's essentially what it is. Willis plays a character who is older than usual in this flick, but other than that; it's just business as usual. I wonder if Willis thinks he's an actual policeman these days? Willis is joined by someone called Mos Def, who I'm guessing is some sort of rapper. Def has the most irritating voice I've ever heard, and his performance is mostly just irritating all round. David Morse is an actor I like to see, however, and while his role here doesn't really allow him to act...that's not really his fault. The plot moves rather quickly and generally the story plays out well. The film is strung together by a series of set pieces, which range from interesting to not particularly good...the centrepiece sequence involving a bus unfortunately being one of the latter. Richard Wenk's script obviously wants to be more intelligent than it is, and little anecdotes such as the one involving Barry White are more silly than intelligent. But even so, this isn't a particularly bad little flick, and its hell of a lot better than the Willis vehicle released this time last year...namely, Hostage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Richard Donner offers nothing new...but the result is still a fun action flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember that old Clint Eastwood film The Gauntlet, in which the craggy-faced one must take on endless bad guys whilst escorting a witness to court? The makers of 16 Blocks obviously do, so similar are the two movies. In this action-packed thriller, however, the policeman on escort duty is an alcoholic, the witness a cake-baking chatterbox, and the bad guys are cops desperate to stop the witness from naming them in court.Director Richard Donner gives us a rather workmanlike effort which delivers plenty of crashes, bangs and wallops, with everything rumbling along nicely to a satisfying conclusion. Bruce Willis gives a fine performance as ageing cop Jack Mosley, but Mos Def grates the nerves with his extremely annoying nasal accent.Those expecting another Die Hard will most definitely be disappointed, but the majority of action fans will find 16 Blocks a reasonably entertaining way to pass the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started to watch 16 Blocks, not even knowing what it was about. When I started to watch it throughout the first 40 minutes, I was like "Oh, great, another crooked cop film". After that though, during Mos Def's incredible performance, I really felt for him and Bruce Willis and was rooting for both of them to escape these evil men who just wanted to protect themselves by killing innocent people to keep their mouths shut.Over all, I really have to say that it is a well paced and great action movie. But like I said, it's really Mos Def that takes the show. I almost just cried for his character, especially when he says the line "People can change", you truly believe him. He and Bruce Willis are just the most lovable characters and made a great team. So, I would recommend this film when you get a chance.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>take Clint Eastwood's The Gauntlet, put it in an urban 21st century setting, and you get this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film, but at times I almost didn't know why. There are at least a few 'standards' (I'm tempted to say clichés, but are they exactly that is arguable) that keep the film a little too inside the box to really break out and be as terrific as it could be. However, there are good scenes, and a central conflict, that keeps the story moving along with enough intensity to keep someone on for the ride. I really liked how there was this equalized determination of the 'job-to-do, come hell or high water' mind-set of Bruce Willis's tired, middle aged cop character, and the dogged ex-partner played by David Morse. Some of there scenes, or just scenes with them on their own paths that obviously intersect with each other, adds some strength to what could be a lot more pedantic and downplaying to the audience. And it also provide Willis with one of his better roles in a while, as a character without a lot of lines (for a reason that is quite clear after a while through Mos Def's Eddie Bunker, funny name by the way), is able to give off a weary presence, like John MacClaine ten years after the last Die Hard without the wit but with all the will of a man on the edge.I don't think the picture is flawless, and this isn't necessarily the blame of director Richard Donner, who has the intelligence with his camera to try not to focus on anything not having to do with character or story. Perhaps it is the script, which gives makes Mos Def the typically blabbermouth comic character, and puts one twist too many for the audience's sake. At the same time there are spots and gaps in the script, or just points that maybe I didn't agree with, the structure worked very well, and the three main male characters of Willis, Def and Morse work off each other to a realistic effect (realistic-movie kind I mean). And, like the film mentioned in the one-line summary, it has that basic premise of The Gauntlet, and yet is competent enough to have its own voice and character. It's impressive that, for example, Donner uses the busy downtown Manhattan streets as another kind of character, of the tension that is all around the cops targeting their one lone ranger, so to speak.In short, worth watching for its audience, with a decent story and good performances. You may like it more than I did, or less, but it isn't ultra high-voltage action, isn't over-stepping with its style, and has some of that good spirit of a lean 70's Eastwood type film, but with the cool presence of Bruce Willis. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film wasn't a original film by any standards, especially when it comes to some films like these that came before it, I think they did a better job. Bruce Willis fan will like this movie with his character of one of those hungover cops that has almost nothing to lose. The movie revolves around Det. Jack Mosley(Bruce Willis) trying to get a witness to a specific destination, while the corrupt feds try to kill the witness and Jack Mosley if they really have to. The dialog in this movie wasn't that sharp and the character Mos Def played got a bit irritating with him talking about random stuff that is very irrelevant and hard to buy into when people are trying to kill them. The movie did have a moral and it didn't feel like they were trying to force it or anything like that. The film felt like watching a game of tag and might sort of get dull after a while and seemed to drag. It was also unrealistic and predictable, so it just comes down to being a very average film.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trouble with cobbling together bits stolen from other peoples cop movies is that unless you are extraordinarily good,all you will end up with is a Pick 'n' Mix selection that is going to annoy admirers of the originals and disappoint those who were hoping to find something fresh and individual in your work. Step forward Mr Richard Donner,he who so astutely exhibits his impeccable liberal credentials in movie after movie whilst having a higher body count than Mr Sam Peckinpah. Anyone visiting this site will be perfectly well aware of Mr Donner's sources in "creating" "16 Blocks",but his blatant cynicism is to be gasped at.Mr Bruce Willis - no less - as a "burnt - out" cop...... That's daring for you.Like a balding Steven Seagal,Mr Willis staggers through the movie with total disinterest,often smiling secretly to himself,no doubt overjoyed about the good money he was receiving for such old rope.Mr Mos Def tries valiantly to retain our interest,but his part is so badly written that you can imagine him crossing his fingers as he delivers some of his lines.Mr David Morse as the evil corrupt former partner of Mr Willis (there's another daring innovation)is the only actor who brings any authenticity to his role.He has the superficial charm and good humour wheeling - dealing cops often possess. Otherwise "Renta - bent - cop" supplied the smaller parts. Endless shots of Messrs Willis and Def being pursued through restaurant kitchens,Chinese Laundries etc etc pall very quickly. Now I know movies are created to make money,but "16 Blocks" is an object lesson that greed is not,in fact,good.It certainly gives the impression that it's makers are in the business to earn a few quick bucks,which I'm sure cannot be the case.Can it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was terrible, but good things first: Mos Def was alright; Bruce Willis was pretty good, he really can look like a totally f***ed-up alcoholic (especially in the beginning, in the end they gave him a more "healthier look" to symbolize the change of his personality). That's it with the good things about this movie. All the other actors were boring; the plot is was if they had a computer-application running to deliver a mediocre script made out of 5 other mediocre movies: it starts at point a and it ends at point b, no surprises, one straight line from a to b; absolutely no no no tension; absolutely no action-scenes; absolutely no twists; absolutely no laughs; absolutely no feeling between Mos Def and Willis; an incredible kitschy ending; moreover this film had as many plot-holes and totally illogical scenes (Willis talking at the phone that he will kill everyone in the bus, but everyone looks as happily as if he's singing a birthday song for his pal Mos Def; he runs around in the city like n alcoholic, but he can grab anyone's telephone and run into any apartment and doesn't even have to say he's a cop, people just smile and are happy to help that sme3lly bastard; Willis' character is sometimes so illogical and unbelievable that it's not ridiculous but sad, that Willis even agreed to play that in the first place x_0).I did not expect a good movie, because I assumed that it's only mediocre from the beginning. I at least expected a mediocre movie. This was not mediocre, this was as interesting as a bottle of coke that stood in the sun for three days, meaning: bad, really really bad.Only Willis and Mos Def made me give 3/10 points for that, even if they were not really good, nevertheless the editing and the boring script ruined most.Better don't watch if you value your time and braincells.PS: Might be something for adolescents though, like 11 to 12 years old, but only the dumb ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first read the description of this movie, my reaction was negative. I could not believe that they would try to remake The Gauntlet. Eastwood and Loke played the perfect parts of a story of a burned out cop trying to buck the odds and get a witness to the courthouse. And where is the love interest in this one. Is Bruce Willis playing a gay cop? But I was soon on the edge of my seat watching two incredible performance. Willis was outstanding as a burned out cop. Perfectly believable. Mos Def was also outstanding as the petty criminal who just wanted to open a bakery. At first I just wanted him to shut up! I expected Willis to slap him and say the same thing. But his patter grows on you and really contributed to the movie.Thius was certainly more believable than The Gauntlet. Doing it in 16 blocks was better that traipsing across the Southwest. It still strains the possible, but it all comes together at the end with a surprise that really was innovative.Highly recommended, but do see the original, too.</fullReview>

Before I saw this movie and another great movie called "Lucky number Slevin" I thought Bruce Willis was someone who wasn't capable of playing anything other than a manly bad ass...but I was dead wrong.

		<fullReview>The saying goes that you can count on two things in life: Death and taxes. Well, let me offer a third option to the popular adage. There are three certainties in life: Death, taxes and the knowledge that Bruce Willis will play a cop in a movie that stacks him against all odds but eventually has him coming out the unequivocal victor.To back my theory, see Hostage, Sin City, Die Hard (1 through 3), Striking Distance, The Last Boy Scout (OK, he didn't play a cop in that one, but it was close) and Mercury Rising. Each film had our reluctant hero fighting the forces of evil while fighting back his own internal demons.Well, the former Mr. Demi Moore is back in our local theatres with the new Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon series) vehicle, 16 Blocks. And guess what? Willis plays a cop (Jack Mosley) that is assigned to escort a witness (Mos Def) to the courthouse whose testimony will bring to an end the long careers of many men in blue. The only thing standing in the way are 16 New York City blocks and what seems to be the entire police force which are willing to consider Mosley collateral damage as long as the witness never makes it court in the two hours allotted to the plot.Along his journey, Mosley will confront his partner of 20 years, take a bus and its passengers hostage, put hundreds of residents of the city in peril for his own personal redemption, and oh yeah, he shoots a cop or two probably just to ensure the movie gets a PG-13 rating.What surprised me with 16 Blocks is that there were no surprises, and for that, I shouldn't have been surprised. Now follow the bouncing ball on this one. For some reason this side of Jessica Simpson being a star, I thought that since Donner and Willis had done this movie genre over and over and over again, that these two must have seen something interesting in the script in order to sign on for something that is more routine than the local bus schedule. Nope. Notta chance. In fact, as the movie progressed, I could have sat and pulled a Mystery Science Theatre on the developments as there was not even one surprise in the entire film (well, maybe one quick one that was there for comedic support and not for plot development). Every cliché was accounted for in full including the hidden recorder and the misrepresentation and consequences of someone reaching into their pocket for what is not a gun.So, if the director and main star's only envelope pushing will be the one that they pass to the bank teller when cashing in their cheque for the film, you hope that either the action sequences or the supporting staff pick it up a notch to keep our interest.Nope. 16 Blocks fails there too. David Morse as former partner Frank Nugent does a great job as Mosley's nemesis, but he brought nothing new to the table and did the same character in The Negotiator back in 1998. Then there is Mos Def as the witness who is supposed to hold the key to all the violence that ensues. As Eddie Bunker, Def is so irritating that he makes me yearn to listen to Adam Sandler whine for two hours while having someone run their nails down a chalkboard than have to hear Def's squeaky voice talk incessantly about become a baker.And that just leaves the action scenes to criticize. Sure they were OK, but how many times have we seen them before. The bus scene, see The Siege. The cops after other cops, see The Negotiator. And trying to get a witness somewhere while the whole world seems to be coming at you with bigger bullets, see Midnight Run.In fact, I recommend seeing all three of those films. Sure, you can travel to the theatre to see Willis put on a good performance (thus the two stars), but why not travel less than 16 blocks to your local video store and pick up the same thing with different actors.www.robertsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excruciating excursion into the vocal deficiencies of Mos Def and Bruce Willis fake Moustache</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike the other reviews listed here, I am not an employee of any of the companies that should be ashamed to be wasting precious materials such as silver to produce such a turgid waste viewers time.I would like to start by saying that we are not attempting to defame this film. We are trying to save you 97mins of your valuable time.Who would have thought that Bruce Willis was unable to travel 16 blocks (WARNING: This may count a spoiler...but not more spoiled then the films script) without ruining large portions of the cities infrastructure when he could have simply got a taxi. Maybe he shouldn't have purchased that wine bottle at the beginning, that way he would have had enough money for the fare.The premise of this film is good but the execution has more problems Bruce Willis's fake moustache. One of the chief problems is that the person Willis is protecting has one of the most annoying voices since the dawn of sound recording. It's hard to engender sympathy for the hero when the person he's protecting is providing an aural irritant worthy of assassination (the only mystery is why Bruce Willis consistently prevents this).Richard Donner might have developed in his old age, short term memory problems. This would explain the continually repetitive coverage of every scene. But it doesn't explain why they didn't overdub Mostly Def (Mos Def) with Barry White. Maybe he has gone deaf as well. David Morse looks extremely upset throughout the movie. By the end of the film his career is 16 blocks further back from where it was before he signed on. I have avoided discussing too many details about the plot because I don't want to show up how awful the script is (Think about what would happen if you added an er onto the writers last name....Thats right, it's Richard Wenker!) and there is very little script or plot development in the film.Maybe this is Bruce Willis revenge for nobody watching Hudson Hawke!Oh, and the alternate ending is much better.AVOID!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Bruce Willis is on, he is really ON! So, was Bruce Willis ON? Well, he was ON duty... he was ON the bus...he was ON peoples' nerves...he was ON "the list"...he was ON this movie. But he was NOT ON the mark! Or rather the movie was NOT ON the mark.It was interesting to see Bruce Willis play an old guy. I figured, "Yeah, he looks old, but he is going to kick some butt later". Well, you are going to have to see the movie to see if he "kicks butt" in your own opinion. In my mind this was not the kind of "butt kicking" you would see in Die Hard movies. You won't hear no "yippee-ky-yo" or "yippee-ty-yay", whatever it was.The movie was good for gratuitous violence, a talkative but lovable "bad" guy(Mos Def), a couple scenes that may make you jump, and a lovable, bad, sad-sack cop(Willis). Except for the major stars, the performances were so-so. Perhaps Willis played his part too well because I found his character to be too subdued.I do wish Willis had been more active in this movie. He could have shown a little more energy once the fun began. Matter of fact, he SHOULD have shown a little more enrgy because just like a lot of old men, this movie had a spurt of energy but pooped out way too early. Now that I think of it, there sure were a lot of old cops in this movie! I guess that helped make Mos Def the highlight of this movie.See it, it's good enough. 6 out of 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best films I have seen in a while. Though i wouldn't categorize this film as a "fast-paced thriller" but more a film about people. Don't get me wrong, the action is great, the humor is perfectly placed, and the acting is phenomenal, but I have to give most of the credit to the writer, Richard Wenk, for brilliantly creating such great characters. Bruce Willis is Jack Mosely- an aging NYPD detective, with a bad leg, and a serious drinking problem. He is assigned the seemingly easy task of escorting witness Eddie Bunker to the nearby courthouse to testify-merely 16 blocks away. What we find out after an attempted execution of Eddie, is that he is testifying against some of New York's finest... The action quickly picks up and the plot is set in motion when Detective Frank Nugent's (David Morse's) team shows up at the bar Jack and Eddie are hiding out in. When Jack begins to understand exactly what is going on, the incredible cat and mouse game begins. Willis does a phenomenal job as Jack, and carries a great performance throughout the entire film. Def is equally charismatic and wonderful, and despite other's opinions, his voice brings a lot to his character and is DEF. not annoying! David Morse, as usual, delivers an amazing performance, showing proof that he will only continue to grow as one of the best dramatic actors of this era. This is a story about people. One who had everything but gave up, and another who never had anything, but never gave up. Together they learn and grow from each other and is is wonderful to watch. Bottom line: The characters? Amazing. The acting? phenomenal. The story? absolutely great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good and entertaining for what it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically everything about this movie indicates that this was just an in between movie. An in between movie for the studios, an in between movie for Richard Donner and an in between movie for Bruce Willis and Mos Def. You can tell this mostly by the movie its cheap and simplistic look, as if the entire movie got shot in only a couple of weeks time. It was obviously not a movie they expected to sweep any awards or break any box office records. Nevertheless "16 Blocks" became a pretty big success, for the simple reason that this is a fine and entertaining movie.Not much was to be expected from this movie, since it featured a simple concept, Bruce Willis with a mustache and a very limited budget. Perhaps this is why the movie surprised me positively. Because my expectations weren't anything too high I simply set back, not fully knowing what to expect from the movie. "16 Blocks" turned out to be simply well made entertainment.The movie is very simple and therefor also easy to follow. It's entire story mostly relies on one single concept of burned out cop Bruce Willis trying to get Mos Def on time to the court house for his testimony, 16 blocks away from the precinct. Yeah of course more happens in between but the movie at all time keeps its focus on its two main characters, which means that the movie also has no distracting plot lines or too many unnecessary characters. So its simplicity is one of the movie its best elements.It's simplicity can also be seen back in the movie its visual look and style. The movie features hand held camera work and the streets of New York were obviously not closed off during shooting and the people in the background are obviously no extra's but real life citizens, who often look surprised as seeing the camera or Bruce Willis running around between them. Because not much got set up for the movie, the movie also has a fast and rushed feeling, which again is consistent with the movie its main concept.Lots of people were worried about seeing Bruce Willis as a 'loser' burned out cop and other people were mad that he kept on doing movies like this, pushing the filming of the new fourth Die Hard movie more and more back. So expectations and anticipations for Bruce Willis in this movie weren't too high from anyone but he simply does a good job, which is no big surprise, since he of course always has been more than a capable actor. Mos Def also does a good job at playing a different kind of character. He could had played his character very simple and safe but he picks a different approach with his character, which also works out refreshing for the movie. It also was good to see David Morse in a big successful production. He acts and plays his character as he had never been away from big respectable box office successes. Simply a good and entertaining movie to watch.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was great from the beginning to the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been a fan of Bruce Willis and he does not disappoint in this entry. Willis plays Jack Mosley, a washed-up has-been police officer/detective and he has been assigned to transport a criminal from his cell to a local courthouse (16 blocks away) where the criminal (Mos Def) will testify about a certain situation that some people that Jack knows don't want to get out to the public. This movie is just non-stop action packed awesomeness from beginning to end. I seriously was so into this movie that when I was feeling that it should be over soon, I glanced at how long I was in to the movie and there was another hour still to go! I type that meaning that this movie is a thrill ride and does not let up at all. Recommended to any action fan who appreciated the Lethal Weapon series (another Richard Donner Project) or any Schwarzenegger action flick from back in the day. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Donner's best, but he makes it work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to directors, Richard Donner is among the best. The man has dabbled in just about every genre: horror, comedy, drama, fantasy, and of coarse, action. Few directors know action like Donner. His Lethal Weapon series has continuously helped reinvent modern cinema. However, after his adaptation of Timeline failed, he went through a dry spell. With the announcement of 16 Blocks, I was hoping that Donner would come back better than ever. While that didn't happen, 16 Blocks is a rarity in the 2000s: an action thriller that is exactly suspenseful and actually well directed. The key to enjoying 16 Blocks is realizing that there are dozens of clichés in the script. One must get back the lack of originality and the Mos Def using an annoying voice for the whole running time. If those two major pitfalls can be ignored then it's very easy to revel in Donner's top-notch direction. The opening scenes set up the pace for the film, which is fast, furious, and tight throughout. I'd love see Donner team with Willis again, preferably on a Die Hard flick. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes it is just the man.Its not a new thing that movies promote personality and that certain personalities find their time.One type is the everyman. James Stewart was of this variety. Not a great man or suave. Not a lover or hero.Bruce Willis mines this type. I have no idea what he is like in person; it hardly matters. Exploiting a personality type in your acting is pretty orthogonal to skill in acting and in most cases fights it. How can you find a character when you bring your own template? But when the template has general utility, and when you have enough power to have roles bent to your strengths, who then it can work. And the vehicle doesn't quite matter unless it is so bad it detracts.This is. It detracts.Yet the character is true, more true than it has been in many projects. A noir character; a hapless everyman caught up in events that could only be caused by an audience turning life into a movie. An everyman, who (until the noble end), merely hangs onto the next second, and then the next.What makes this character work is our recognition of the man and our acknowledgment of him. When we recognize him, we anchor a personality type. So when we see him in a role, it is always in reference to that type.So we notice whether he stands a little in front of or behind that incubated type. The type is based on a puckish familiarity with the audience. This type looks at the camera and silently conveys "you know I'm just acting here and isn't it a joke." The type comes from comedians who shift back and forth between being in a group and then quickly shifting outside the group to observe it and make (funny) comments. I think the tradition is Jewish but the best comedian in this tradition today is Chris Rock.So when we see Willis in a role, he is either in front, as here, or behind as in "Sixth Sense" where he makes fun of his making fun. "Last Man Standing" is another example.Its odd, huh, how some of the best acting has nothing at all to do with the traditional dramatic values of character, story, motivation and instead has to do with metaissues of how we sit in the world and what we allow ourselves to say about it.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruce Boy Shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think one of the few actors who continually improves his acting with every movie is Bruce Willis. In this movie, he is a NYPD detective entrusted with bringing a witness to the courthouse, who is in jail only 16 blocks from the courthouse. His superior promises Bruce overtime. So, Bruce, who is half drunk from drinking a bottle in his last assignment and who has stayed up all night, reluctantly agrees to pick up the witness. I will not spoil the fascinating plot that ends up with Bruce shooting two policemen and being almost executed by his fellow cops. But, police corruption has always been a danger, in all societies. For example, the film Serpico concerns such corruption in the same setting of New York City. It is truly hard to be a policeman in an urban center, and my heart and prayers go out to the NYPD dedicated public safety workers. But, there is always that temptation for some to abuse their power and position and go to the "dark side." And, surely the temptation to eliminate an inconvenient witness to a crime by policemen, for example, is only too real. Bruce is utterly believable in his role and comfortable in his borrowed skin. If Bruce doesn't win an Academy Award for this role, Bruce will never win one. The black supporting actor, Mos Def, who talks like Mike Tyson, is remarkable, too. The photography is brilliant, with many superb closeups and action sequences including a sequence with a New York City bus that brings back memories of Keanu Reeves in Speed. This is truly a stunning, thrilling, and touching film, that should be required viewing for those interested in a career in Criminal Justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resurrection of Tired and Wornout Plot Line, Well Done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though this is undeniably a well acted, well directed action film, it has all been done before. In 1977, "The Gauntlet" starring Clint Eastwood (who also directed if I remember correctly) and Sondra Locke (as a feisty prostitute) had to run a cross-country gauntlet of Mob figures and cops on the Mob payroll. And the last part of the trip was in (TA-DAAAA!!!), a BUS. This vehicle survived machine guns, sniper rifles, hand grenades, and everything that could be thrown at it, sound familiar? The plot of whiskey-soaked cop and bad-boy (or girl) character, who is under the protection of the cop and inexplicably forms a close and intricate bond between the two is not new or even fresh. The on-screen action is great, the actors lure you into the complicated warp and weave of their two-dimensional lives, but I can't help the nagging feeling of Deja Vu. Perhaps us old fogeys shouldn't have such long memories, then we could enjoy the "NEW" movies. Sorry, just my humble opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willis, Def make great team in Donner's slick crime thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Willis does his best Sylvester Stallone "Copland" impersonation as an alcoholic, out-of-shape, burnt-out New York City police detective who's tired of living in Richard Donner's entertaining thriller, "16 Blocks." Willis is Jack Mosley, limping, looking haggard and hung over as he is called to babysit a couple of corpses that were formerly drug dealers. After that all night duty, he is ordered by his lieutenant to pick up a prisoner in the city jail and transport him to the federal courthouse.He doesn't want to do it, but the guy has to testify in front of a grand jury before 10 a.m. So the plot is set up which has more twists and turns than Lombard Street. According to his superior officer, the distance he and the prisoner have to travel is just 16 blocks, hence the title.The con is Eddie Bunker (Mos Def, "Dave Chappelle's Block Party"), a bumbling, stumbling idiot who sounds like a cross between Jerry Lewis and Daman Wayans homeless wino character on "In Living Color." Everything goes fine until Mosley stops to buy some booze at a local liquor store. As thugs try to knock Eddie off, though, he comes out of his alcohol-soaked stupor long enough to kill one and escape with his prisoner from another.After ducking into a bar, Jack finds out Eddie was to testify against some very crooked cops, including Lt. Frank Nugent (David Morse, Green Mile"), Jack's partner for 20 years. When Nugent threatens to frame and then kill Eddie, something awakens deep inside him, and Jack realizes he cannot allow this to happen.He shoots one of the officers and escapes. Now on the run, he and Eddie must fight a battalion of dirty cops and make it to the courthouse before the jury is excused at 10 a.m.The plot then takes us through several New York City locations, including Chinatown, as well as a series of close escapes by the two protagonists. As they run, Eddie gabs on and on about his dream to open a bakery in Seattle (specializing in birthday cakes). Jack, moody and depressed, just listens without saying much of anything.The chemistry between Willis and Mos Def is very good. It's a bit annoying with the rapper chattering on constantly, but his irritation begins to charm the hard-boiled officer who complains early in the film that life lasts "too long," but by the time they part, he has a true fondness for the young man. This is not surprising, though, since Donner helmed the ultimate cop/buddy/grudging respect film series, "Lethal Weapon." I was also as pleasantly surprised at Def's performance as I was last year by Andre Benjamin's work in "Four Brothers." It seems that some rappers CAN act. His stuttering vulnerability and sincere emotional effort was a true breakthrough.</fullReview>

The camera pans round Jack once, and his gun is clearly empty as the slide is ratcheted back the way clip fed and/or semi automatic weapons do when they're empty. The camera pans round once more, Jack hasn't moved, but the slide of the gun is back in the normal firing position, and the gun has been reloaded as Jack fires it more shortly after this scene.

		<fullReview>(Synopsis) New York police detective Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis) is on his way home when his lieutenant assigns him a simple task of escorting a petty criminal, Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), from lockup to the courthouse which is only 16 blocks away. Jack has been a police officer for over 20-years, and now he is over the hill with a bad leg and a drinking problem. All Jack wants is to get a bottle and go home. What Jack doesn't know is that Eddie made a deal with the District Attorney to testify against a fellow police officer at his station before a grand jury. A van with two hit men are following Jack as he leaves the station, and their job is to kill Eddie before he can testify. Jack prevents the assassination, and they escape the scene and run into a bar. Jack calls for backup, and his ex-partner Frank Nugent (David Morse) and his team are the first to arrive at the bar. Unfortunately for Eddie, one member of the team is the cop Eddie is about to testify against. Jack must choose between his fellow cops or protecting the life of a criminal.(Comment) If you are a fan of Bruce Willis and like his type of movies, you can go see this. This is another of Bruce Willis's traditional semi-hero movies. We love movies where Bruce beats the bad guys. However, I did not like the movie that much, and the main reason was the annoying nasal voice of Mos Def. Every time he opened his mouth, it hurt my ears. As for David Morse, his acting was top notch and very convincing as a cop. What wasn't convincing was some of the script. I know when an officer is down; all of a sudden, you would have hundreds of cops on the scene, not just Nugent's small team. The movie has a lot of action and some funny spots.

		<shortDescription>Over-run with clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>16 Blocks By Dean Kish Imagine if you will, you are sitting at your desk and you're a struggling screenwriter and your project is to write a screenplay using the clichéd techniques such as "slight of hand", "misdirection", "archetypes" and "caricatures". It's just a test to see if you can do it.Well during the writing process you may find yourself drifting towards the "cop genre" because hasn't every cop show or film suffered from over-use of technique at some point or another. So you choose to write a screenplay about cops and just for originality let's make all of them bad and one guy is against the corrupt system. (insert: sarcastic tone here) Now that you have your genre you would probably choose the "buddy-cop formula" because well it's perfect and has been done to death.After the test is complete, you hear that "over-the-hill" director Richard Donner and star Bruce Willis have read the script by mistake and are interested in making it a film. Well that's perfect both are quite familiar with the "buddy-cop scenario". Donner created the "Lethal Weapon" franchise and Willis starred in "The Last Boy Scout".But it was a joke, a test to see if you could really use every cop cliché known to man. Then they offer you $4 million for the script. You are dumb-struck and shrug your shoulders and take the money.If you haven't realized it yet, the script you just sold was "16 Blocks".Basically "16 Blocks" must have been created something like what I described above. The whole film is just one big over-used and stomped on cliché. First you have the alcoholic cop (Bruce Willis) who is looking for redemption and trying to become a man once more. Second you have the wise-cracking sidekick (Mos Def) who is in trouble with the law and has to deal with this bloated drunk who would rather breathe on him than save him. Then here's a twist, the cop's old partner (David Morse) is this corrupt guy who is trying to cover everything up. Throw these caricatures into "real-time" 2-hour cat-and-mouse scenario and you have "16 Blocks".There are so many things wrong with this movie it's hard to say what's good. I have to admit I liked Willis, though. His grumbling, bloated cop-drunk is done very well. And the film not for one moment makes him an actual action hero. This man is a loser and the film never apologizes for that fact. It's a solid performance and it's probably the only thing the film does correct and makes sense.Mos Def has a lot of potential to be a good character actor. "16 Blocks" is not a good example of that. Basically the best way to describe his performance is that it's like watching a Chris Tucker movie after chugging a half bottle of Nyquil. I think the filmmakers were trying for a Chris Tucker or a "48-Hrs" Eddie Murphy but instead just got an overly annoying nasally-congested comic relief. But come to think of it, he wasn't really that funny.I like David Morse. I am not scared to admit that. After witnessing his sleep-walking performance in this film, I am beginning to change my interpretation of the man. He was a solid actor until he became a carbon-copied duplicate of every villain performance the man has ever done. I know he can change, what do you think? The person who should probably be ashamed the most is Richard Donner. This guy needs to retire from directing and stick to producing. After 2003's "Timeline", I forgave him stating that the man is a legend and brought classic films like "Lethal Weapon", "Superman" and "Maverick". But now I think the man should just stop embarrassing himself and ride off into the sunset. The man is a legend so let's remember him that way."16 Blocks" should be studied by screen-writing students as a warning what not to do. If it does garner cult status I bet it will be as a movie geek's drinking game like take 2 shots every time there is a cop flick cliché and take three drinks every time Willis shoots or takes a drink.

		<fullReview>Here is another example of the trash that Hollywood is turning out these days. Bruce Willis and David Morse are very good in their parts, but could not believe the performance by Mos Def who mumbled through his part in this weak movie. Instead of a good script we have more shoot-em-ups, blow-em-ups in this movie. It is a story of a washed up cop who finds his conscience and fights the bad guys. There were more bullets flying in this movie than there was speech. This movie just dragged on blowing up a bus, cars etc. Evidently those going to the movies now a day would rather see action than a good story line. Save your money on this one and just pass it by. It is a shame to see David Morse in a bomb like 16 Blocks. I can understand Bruce Willis whose career is on the decline appearing in this Bomb.</fullReview>
