		<fullReview>This movie got an Oscar for the script (among the others, by Pietro Germi, the gifted director). However, the real importance of this movie can be demonstrated by saying that an entire genre, "la commedia all'italiana" (Comedy, Italian style) is named after this movie.A major issue of this genre is to make fun of our traditions and culture (I am Italian) despite the radical changes our Country was having during those years ('60s, '70s).The main issue of Neo-realism (Rossellini, De Sica, Visconti) was to describe the tragic reality of miserable lives after the catastrophic WWII. Then the Italian economic boom of the '50s drove Italy into modernity and wellness. Commedia all'italiana wanted to remind us that despite this modernity we are always the same Italians we were before, with all our intelligence but also with all our defects."Divorce, Italian Style" is set in the most 'conservative' place of Italy of that time, where traditions like family honor were still predominant despite all modernity. In the first shots of the movie we see an environment suffocated by the heat of the Sicilian climate. People spend part of the day in their apartments waiting for the cool evening. This motionless environment is highly metaphoric, as it shows that nothing really changes in this land, suffocated by the weight of old traditions. Probably this is not so true today, but at that time certainly was. However, don't be scared by this introduction. The movie is FUN and it turns into a fast-paced rhythm shortly.The protagonist loves his cousin and wants to marry her, but he is already married. So he plans to murder the wife, pretending to do that for a 'legitimate' defence of honor. What is amazing is that all the village, all the people in the movie support murder for the honor of the family. They even induce him to kill. And what is sad, is that the law at that time was really soft for those types of murders.To summarize this movie has these characteristics: 1) VERY FUN. You can't stop laughing even if the script is tragic (this is a characteristic of masterpieces) 2) WELL ACTED: Marcello Mastroianni gives one of his best performances. Stefania Sandrelli is beautiful as ever, Marcello's wife is ugly and a nuisance as her role imposes, and Leopoldo Trieste is another great actor of Italian cinema.3) WONDERFUL STORY: the script won the Oscar and it is truly very intelligent 4) SOCIALLY COMMITTED: it is an accusation of a wrong law that supports a wrong tradition (the law was changed shortly after).I give this masterpiece a 10 out of 10, and I strongly recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hilarious spoof of marriage and the family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Pietro Germi's movies (a long time ago), I thought he was a misogynist who portrayed women as grotesque monsters that make men's lives miserable. Thirty years later, after the women's movement, I have come around 180 degrees, and see him as a feminist before his time--showing how the patriarchal family destroys women (and men)and exposing the absurdity of "family honor"--and doing it with humor. It doesn't just apply to Sicily. The Sicilian setting and ambiance is a big part of this movie, however--watch for all the little details of gestures and interactions, and the great shots of the sunbaked town, baroque churches, and interiors of the decaying houses of the aristocrats. Mastroianni is terrific, and so is the supporting cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)Divorzio all'italiana is a richly textured satire of Sicilian macho Catholic life styles starring one of Italy's greatest actors, Marcello Mastroianni. He is a bit Chaplinesque in this tongue in cheek exploration of how to dump your wife and marry your 16-year-old cousin. His wide-eyed, dead pan expressions combined with vulnerability and suave, leading-man good looks made him the heart-throb of women for decades. He plays a bored baron stuck with a baroness (played fatuously by Daniela Rocca) that he cannot abide. It should be noted that today it IS possible to get a divorce in Italy, but at the time it was very difficult, perhaps easier to get an annulment, and so we have the premise of the plot.Stefania Sandrelli, who became one of the great ladies of the Italian cinema, plays the cousin. She was only 15 when the film was shot but could easily pass for, say, 18. She is sensual, sweet and a bit naughty. In the final scene, famous for its fitting irony, the last thing we see are her feet. I won't tell you more, but the movie is almost worth seeing just for that final scene.Rocca's Rosalia on the other hand is more syrupy than sweet and would qualify as clinging. She could smother a lumberjack, and although it is not polite to comment unfavorably on a lady's looks, I must note that she seemed to be having a bad facial hair day, everyday. Her impersonation of a country baroness nonetheless was unforgettable. I also liked 16-year-old Margherita Girelli as Sisini, the maid. Her coquettish ways helped to lend a French bedroom farce flavor to the film.But what really makes this one of the great monuments of the Italian cinema is the witty and delightful script by Ennio De Concini (it won an Academy Award in 1962) and the detailed, textured direction by Pietro Germi. The picture that Germi paints of life in a small Sicilian (or southern Italian, for that matter) village is picturesque, much imitated, and indelible. The crowded ornate clutter of the old estate, the sun-drenched streets and the monolithic stone and mason churches haunt our memory. True, the film starts a bit slowly and drags (at least for modern audiences) a bit at times, but don't make the mistake of giving up on this. The latter half of the film is wonderful. And remember, if you had to go to film school, Divorce Italian Style would be on the syllabus.So see this for Mastroianni of course but also because no film education would be complete without having seen Divorzio all'italiana.The Criterion Collection DVD includes a second disc with a documentary on Germi's career, an interview with Ennio De Concini, and screen-test footage of Stefania Sandrelli and Daniela Rocca that I just had to see. There is also a booklet with reviews of the film from Stuart Klawans, Andrew Sarris, and Martin Scorsese. Scorsese's review is adoring and nostalgic since he is from Sicily and since the film had made such a lasting impression on him as a 19-year-old. For him the film was not so much a comedy as a true reflection of a life he and his family had known. He writes, "Every detail in Divorce Italian Style is so truthful and right that all Germi had to do was heighten everything a bit to make it funny."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the best Italian comedies ever made, a movie you can watch over and over again... Mastroianni gives an excellent performance as an impoverished Sicilian aristocrat determined to get a divorce from his wife. There is only one complication - divorce is illegal in Italy at the time. However, there is also a law that justifies the killing of a wife if she is caught during an act of adultery. As with most others Germi's films, this one is a unique mix of situational comedy and social drama. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love Sicilian style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine the life of Baron Ferdinando Cefalu, an impoverished middle aged man who has fallen in love with his young cousin Angela. In the society of Agramonte, Sicily, of that time, being poor was endurable, but the pangs of love Ferdinando feels in his heart, is consuming him, but his bigger problem is he is married to Rosalia, a woman who truly loves him, or so it seems. What could a man do in Ferdinando's shoes? Nothing, since in the Italy of those years divorce was not allowed, either by the state, or the church.The only possible solution to solve Ferdinando's problems is in trying to kill Rosalia. In the Italian penal code of the times, people could plea guilty in trying to avenge their honor and would get lesser sentences. Rosalia, who has no idea of what's going on, has a secret of her own. Years ago, she had been in love with Carmelo Patane, a man who went to war and on his return found that his beloved Rosalia had already married Baron Ferdinando! It's the Baron, who discovers the letters Rosalia likes to read on the sly, late at night. Ferdinando devises a plan that will bring Carmelo to repaint some of the frescoes of the old palatial home, hoping Rosalia and the painter will try to reacquaint themselves, as it's obvious that even though Carmelo is married, he still loves Rosalia! The Baron, who has bought a tape recorder, and spies on his wife and the painter, knows the end is in sight and gambling on getting a short jail time, goes ahead with his plans. Little does he know what his life with Angela will be like!"Divorce Italian Style", directed by Pietro Germi, was a satire about Italian law that allowed such practices to take place. In a complete Catholic society, people got married for life, literally. Since there was no divorce, couples who found out they were not compatible had to keep on staying married because divorce was not an option. Pietro Germi and his collaborators take a look at how, with some clever research, imagination, and ingenuity, an unhappily married man could get a release from those restricting marital vows.Marcello Mastroianni was perfect as Baron Ferdinando Cefalu. The actor clearly knew this man and the mentality of men like his character. His facial expressions are worth the price of the rental of this wonderful Criterion DVD. Mastroianni, one of the best film actors of his generation gives one of the best performances of his career. Daniella Rocca, who plays Rosalia, makes a great contribution to make this film the winner it is. Leopoldo Trieste, another important figure in the Italian cinema, appears as Carmelo Patane, the painter who never stopped loving Rosalia. Stefania Sandrelli, is seen briefly as the object of Ferndinando's passion and love.The DVD transfer has kept the film black and white cinematography of Carlo DiPalma and Leonida Barboni intact. We can see the sunny Sicilian town in all its splendor as captured by the camera of these men. Pietro Germi, the director and co-writer, delivered a film that is a classic because of the humanity, love and humor that went into this tremendously satisfying work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Baron Ferdinando Cefalu is very much in love with his cousin, Angela, and wishes to marry her. The only problem? He's already married. Since divorce is outlawed the Baron decides to get rid of his wife with a lesser crime: murder. "Divorce, Italian Style" is a pitch black satire of a chauvinist society and Italy's hypocritical judicial system.Marcello Mastroianni, best known for his starring role in 8 1/2, is delightfully woeful and sarcastic as Baron Cefalu. His expressions and his nervous tics provide several good chuckles. Daniela Rocca is perfectly annoying as Baroness Cefalu, making it quite easy to take delight in her husband's murderous fantasies. Stefania Sandrelli is quite good as Angela. Her scenes with Mastroianni are especially passionate and, since this was one of Sandrelli's earliest films, they show a real talent in the making.While I did laugh at "Divorce, Italian Style" (as well as that amazing Criterion cover art), don't expect a straight up comedy. It does make a serious point about the failings of Italy's judicial system. I will also admit that watching Baroness Cefalu drown in quicksand was an unpleasant sight, and not funny at all. Watching her get blasted into space = side-splitting laughter. Watching her drown in quicksand = uncomfortable.However, don't be detered from this film. If you've never seen any of Mastroianni's films this is the one to start with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely a classic film, but not just an Italian classic! "Divorzio all'italiana" centers itself around Ferdinando Cefal? (Mastroianni), a 37 year old baron in a small town. Although he's a baron, his life is not completely perfect as his father has squandered much of their money, and his extremely clingy wife Rosalia stands between him and the only thing he loves, his 16 year old cousin Angela. To add salt to the wound, 1960's Italy does not allow couples to divorce, which leads Ferdinando to seek desperate measures. After a town scandal erupts, when a woman murders her cheating husband to protect her honor, Ferdinando is inspired to set up his wife with a lover in order to kill her and "protect his honor." The rest of the movie chronicles Ferdinando's attempts to find someone who would fit the bill."Divorzio all'italiana" is a satirical look at Italian society and its seemingly backward laws which force people to do stupid things and its fallibility at justice. In its social commentary of Italian laws/society, Concini, Germi, and Giannetti (the writers) create well fitted, stereotypical characters that are much needed in order for the message of the film to get across. Ferdinando plays the evil nobleman, Rosalia as the annoying wife, Angela as the desirable secret teen lover, etc. The beauty of the story not only lies in it's scathingly funny humor, with Ferdinando's clever plotting and hallucinations of killing his wife, but also in its ability to transcend time. Nowadays there are no laws that forbid divorce in most societies, but even though that crucial point does not relate to modern audiences, the film is still able to conjure emotions for the characters' plight. Another great thing about the film, is the idea of a protagonist character with typically antagonist characteristics. Ferdinando is definitely a bad man, but the story plays with the audience in making them want Ferdinando to succeed in his plot. To add to the underlying theme of the film, the failure of Italian laws, is the theme of "justice" whether it be from the law or from a simple reversal of fate. Definitely watch the film up to the very end, as it closes with an ironic yet justified twist of fate for the characters involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When America First Met Marcello</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my lifetime I have seen about ten to twenty films with Marcello Mastroianni in them, including two made before he made "Divorce Italian Style", but for me the film that imprinted himself to American film audiences was this one. His Baron Ferdinando Cefalo is one of the cleverest homicidal figures in movies, and yet one of the most bumbling. One can say he succeeds despite himself. Set in Sicily, then as now the poorest area of Italy and one of the most backward, the film shows how the Baron is bored by his present wife Rosalia (Daniela Rocca), a good woman but somewhat overwhelming in her unwanted affection. Rosalia is not unattractive (in a lightly heavy manner), but she is certainly not currently able to get more than a mild interest in her husband in whatever she is doing. The Baron is quite interested in his young female cousin Angela (Stefania Andrelli), a vibrant and young woman who is about to go to convent school. Baron Ferdinando would love to marry Angela, but how to get rid of Rosalia? Divorce (as Americans know it) is not liked in Catholic countries, particularly in the most backward sections of them. But the laws of the day in Italy (say about 1955 or so) have a crazy version of the so-called "unwritten law" regarding shooting adulterers...except the Italian version allows for the shooting of the guilty spouse by his or her wronged spouse, and the granting of a relatively light sentence (believe it or not three years!). The problem is that the killer must catch the adulterous pair in their act of guilty passion when they are doing it. And there must be sufficient emotional pressure on the perpetrator to justify a case of sudden homicidal impact. Baron Ferdinando has to orchestrate out of artificial methods the exact situation to enable him to legally kill Rosalia. He presses ahead, and his society is shown for all it's secrets and backwardness.First, he studies up on the law and recent cases, even checking out the grand Italian lawyer with his flowery oratory style who he will use (later on we hear the lawyer's possible future speech describing some of the actions of the Baron as he pursues his dream). Then he has to find a good patsy - who is the other man? Here he finds this fellow is gay, that one is happily married, that one (in the choir) has...well a physical problem. Finally he selects an old friend of Rosalia, a painter from Messena named Carmelo Patane (Leopoldo Trieste). The Baron gives Carmelo a restoration job in his villa (I'm kind when I call his ramshackle home that), and then makes sure that Rosalia and Carmelo are left by themselves a lot.In his way he tries to be modern in this 18th Century atmosphere. He tape records the private conversations of Rosalia and Carmelo to see if they have finally broken down to commit their adultery. This is far more tedious than he hoped, as Rosalia tries to maintain her loyalty to his husband, and Carmelo keeps a major secret from Rosalia. As they break down there is also the problems of the love-sick maid who Carmelo is also attracted to. And as each problem arises we watch the Baron try to figure out how to overcome them.When the crisis arises finally we see the locals at their worst, with the men laughing at the Baron's being cuckolded, but everyone freezing out him and his family because his reaction is to take to his bed. But he is only waiting for the right moment to avenge his honor. When will it occur, or will it ever occur?Italian cinema had been part of the international film language since 1945 with Neo-realism, and masters like Rossalini, De Sica, and (later) Fellini. Some of the films of the 1950s, like the original "Big Deal On Madonna Street", included Mastroianni in the casts, but others (Vittorio Gassman, Toto) were the stars or shared the fun. This film put him on the map for our audiences, with his proper, well dressed, soft-spoken minor aristocrat, with his "tic" (he clicks his mouth when something unexpected or unpleasant occurs around him). With slicked down hair and droopy, trimmed mustache, he looks like a man whose been losing at gambling tables all night at the rate of one lira an hour - no smile, but no real feeling of great loss. It was a memorable dead pan performance. He never quite repeated it (most of his characters were far more lively in their antics), but it stamped itself on American audiences. Soon his series of films with Sophia Loren cemented him into the position of Italy's leading romantic male film figure and great farceur. He never failed to live up to those two views in all of the films he appeared in until his death in 1996.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. It's one of those masterpieces in which everything - direction, acting, script, music - is so flawless, the result is almost miraculous. This wickedly funny gem by Pietro Germi is one of the greatest Italian comedies, and also a biting satire.Sicilian baron Fernando Cefal? (Mastroianni, exceptional) falls in love with Angela (Stefania Sandrelli). To marry her, Fernando needs to get rid of his annoying wife Rosalia (Daniela Rocca), so he manipulates his spouse into betraying him with Carmelo (Leopoldo Trieste); according to the old Italian penal code, any husband who killed an adulterous wife would get a mere three years sentence.Mastroianni carries the movie with a note-perfect performance as the baron, a deadpan, amoral man with an utterly phoney sense of honor. Pirandello would have loved this two-faced character. Supporting actors are wonderful too, from Daniela Rocca as the archetypal obnoxious wife to Leopoldo Trieste as her awkward lover, from young Stefania Sandrelli to minor players in small roles (like the pompous lawyer or the mob boss).The Academy Award-winning script has an hilariously cynical streak. The soundtrack is genius and used in an unforgettable way - who can forget the sardonic march as Cefal? struts around the town while everybody whispers behind his back?10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marcello Mastroianni is superb in comedy about dishonored husband...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DIVORCE Italian STYLE is one of the funniest films I've ever seen on the subject of how to dissolve a marriage--Italian style, of course. Seems those Italians have a way of forgiving murder if the spouse has cheated and is found in the act--which must give rise to some pretty unsavory stories in real life as well as here.But however unpleasant the subject matter may seem, this is the merriest romp of a comedy I've come across in a long time. It's so artful in the way it gets inside the mind of the impoverished aristocrat (MARCELLO MASTROIANNI) living in palatial ruins in Sicily and desperately devising a way to get rid of his boring wife. He devises a plan that goes awry when "La Dolce Vita" comes to town and, with all the men in the village attending it, his wife takes that opportunity to run off with her lover.It's a masterful job that Mastroianni does here, giving little signs of distress with a twitch of his mustache, a frown, a concentrated gaze--in other words, bewitched, bothered and bewildered as he contemplates how to go about getting rid of his freedom so he can pursue a young girl he's enamored of. All the events leading up to the final act are hilariously Italiano in style--those little devils knew how to take advantage of the judicial system.Summing up: A sheer delight from beginning to end, thanks to a masterful job by Marcello Mastroianni in his Oscar-nominated role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would you do if you've been married for many years, lost any romantic interest in your less than attractive wife, and fell in love with a beautiful young girl? Divorce, you'd say but there is one thing, you see - in Italy in 1960s there were no divorce. So, once again, what would you do? Made forty five years ago about an old Italian Law that had declared divorce illegal but would give a minimum sentence for killing a cheating spouse, "Divorce, Italian Style" is hilarious, melancholic, biting, clever, and belongs to the best comedies ever. First, Germi was going to make a tragic film and there are many elements of tragedy in "Divorce, Italian Style". After all, two people who are in love and happy together will be killed because of the strict and unforgiving traditions that made their way into the laws of the country. Pietro Germi directed a movie that is saturated with the merciless boredom, suffocating heat and humidity of a small Sicilian town where seemingly nothing ever happens and where Baron Fete Gefalu leads the life of not so quiet desperation with his wife or 13 years, Rosalia who had bored him to death. To make the things worse, his 16 years old angelic cousin Angela (one look at 16 years old Stefania Sandrelli in her early role and you can forgive or at least understand Fete) just returned from the nun school and he is desperately in love with her. As we know, love moves the sun and the planets and it made Fete's mind invent the plan on how to get rid of Rosalia which was deliciously simple and deadly funny. What Fete did was unspeakable but HOW Marcello Mastroianni played it was one of the greatest comedic performances I've ever seen. To watch his face when he was imagining all sorts of creepy accidents to Rosalia and to hear him narrating the movie was Delight from the opening scene to the incredible and brilliant in its irony final.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a moment in Pietro Germi's Divorzio all'italiana (aka: Divorce Italian Style) that pretty much defines everything, that sort of defines what a black comedy is all about: a certain woman murders her husband because he had run away with another woman, that certain woman murdered him while he was out with his new love. And that certain woman had something similar with our main character, Marcello Mastroianni's Baron Ferdinando Cefal?, and actually after the murder she crossed path with Ferdinando. The moment that sort of defines everything is when these two, the certain woman and our main character, are together since is Mastroianni delivering a really great laugh, is Ferninando being like "" ...certainly and certainly is the way that Mastroianni delivers the scene that makes it so fantastic and hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marcello Mastroianni stars a Ferdinando Cefalú, a baron of a dishonored family who lustfully longs for his cousin, Angela(the luscious Stefania Sandrelli). He has a wife, Rosalia(Daniela Rocca) who longs for attention and probes constantly of whether he loves her not. She is such an annoyance, he begins a scheme to corrupt her finding an old love from the past, a painter restorer Carmelo(Leopoldo Trieste). Divorce in Italy is a no-no, but if a spouse is caught in the act of adultery, murder might be seen as merely a way of saving one's honor at such a disgraceful act. This is Ferdinando's desire..to match his wife and her former love together and, upon catching them embracing, murdering them so that he can rightfully pursue Angela. Hilarious consequences ensue.This film is quite a treat..it doesn't miss a note. There's a very funny plug for Fellini's "La Dolce Vita"(starring Mastroianni)towards the end of the film which is supposed to be a set-up for Ferdinando's catching them together at his home as he is away to the cinema. The ending has a great sense of irony as we see this man approaching 40 doing what he can to be with a 16 year old teen who is the daughter of his sister. That seems a bit taboo in itself, but the film is about exposing, and poking fun at, taboos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Divorzio all'Italiana (1961) features Marcello Mastroianni's truly sparkling performance as an infatuated Sicilian Baron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Divorzio all'Italiana (1961)is the story of a man's gradual decline,the Sicilian Baron Cefalú who,disgusted with his wife (Daniela Rocca) and her advances,aims at a very young woman's charms,and he finds her in his own household.To be with her,the fretted Baron has to get rid of his boring wife.So,the movie is in the "how to kill your ..." scheme.Good-looking,sly,randy,lithe, almost young,Marcello Mastroianni wants to escape from his marriage's mire;his smoldering passion for the graceful Stefania Sandrelli (here,a teenager) breaks out,after a series of fortuitous encounters with the child:he runs into her in the street, on the beach,in the church.The girl's secret diary confesses that the erotic feelings are mutual.The film records this crescendo,the multiple factors that compete to bring the two hearts together.But Stefania Sandrelli's grumpy father has no respect for privacy,and reads her diary ....Marcello Mastroianni's role as Cefalú is brilliant,staggering, astonishing, much above the sarcastic,shameless story.In his bright 30s and 40s,Marcello Mastroianni,here 37 years old,and one year after The Sweet Life,made several sex comedies (Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow ; Matrimonio all'Italiana ,1964;Oggi, Domani, Dopodomani ,1965;L'Uomo Dei Cinque Palloni,1965;Casanova '70,1965;A Slightly Pregnant Man,etc.), giving constantly radiant and wonderfully inspired performances that are among cinema's gems.One can not speak about Marcello Mastroianni otherwise than with infinite respect.He belongs to the rank of the greatest film actors ever,on a par with Pierre Fresnay,Louis Jouvet,Michel Simon,Simone Signoret, Jeanne Moreau,Gérard Depardieu,Erich Von Stroheim ,James Cagney.Now,one word about my favorite actress,Stefania Sandrelli.I admire her since I was 18 years old.Her stunning role as Angela is one of the two definitive expressions of her sexuality (the other being Teresa Rolfe in La Chiave, 1983). Divorce, Italian Style is the sheer definition of the level of showmanship that even the popular Italian cinema reached in the '60s.It evokes the Meridional communal existence ,the family life of a Sicilian baron,and his retreats counterpoise his family life (wife,sister,genitors,etc.).The strength of this brutal and gruesome sex comedy is its low-brow self assurance.Yet,it has a finesse,a cynicism that do not recommend it to the adolescence's mind;it is simultaneously brutal and of a certain fineness,it demands,to be enjoyed,interest for life.The music is languorous and desirous in the first half,and funeral in the second.In Divorzio all'Italiana (1961),the nudity,that is Stefania Sandrelli's ,skimps to a naked spotless shoulder,and her body is more bright,tender and luminous than ever.The erotic run in this movie,the sex race,is symmetrical to the one to be found in another famous Italian sex comedy,Mal?na (2000).The barrister is the same,his pleading ,his declamation arise from the same chasm of ridicule.The provincial society is,also,the very same."Divorzio ..." is a more cynical,derisive, biting satire,Pietro Germi is a more brutal and corrosive satirist than Giuseppe Tornatore, and less indignant.Having already done remarkable ,defining roles in The Night ,The Sweet Life ,White Nights ,Chronicle of Poor Lovers,Marcello Mastroianni's role in "Divorzio ..." is a fashioned,vigorous,resourceful and vivid expression of his charm and intelligence.He is drowsy,sagging,bored,he becomes tetchy and devilish,then bewildered,then blasé.At first,he seems an almost entitled,in his exasperation,gentleman,but then,he comes out as a dullard,a rather disgusting profligate,a wanton dolt. Gradually,the philanderer Cefalú looses our sympathy.On its level,this vulgar and lively,fast paced comedy is somehow flawless.But its real value comes from the quality of its two leads. The entire cast is deserving and skilled (Daniela Rocca,Margherita Girelli,Leopoldo Trieste ...),but Marcello Mastroianni and Stefania Sandrelli are,here,at their energies' peak;an early one,for Stefania Sandrelli.I remember Mastroianni dreaming of transforming his wife into soap,or of sending her in space as a laughing Gagarin.Quite fallow jokes,but Marcello Mastroianni gives them force.Daniela Rocca had a short career,only a few movies in the '50s and '60s.Pietro Germi made several interesting movies,the last one is from 1972; he died in 1974.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest Italian comedies I have ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a bizarre tribute to my mom on her 75th birthday and her 46-year-marriage to her only love, my father, who died in 2011, and to her subsequent loyalty and devotion, with stubborn refusal to even contemplate having another relationship, I decided to watch 'Divorce Italian Style'. It was hilarious and highly enjoyable. It certainly deserved its Oscar win for Best Screenplay, as well as its nominations that year both for Best Actor (Marcello Mastroianni) and Best Director (Pietro Germi).The latter tends to get thrown under the bus and ignored altogether when it comes to mentioning pivotal Italian directors of the period. Not so. Though this is thus far the only film of his I have seen, the guy--both in terms of script writing this comedy and behind the camera--is a sheer genius. Do yourself a favour and watch it today!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serenading Black Comedy is Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer, director Pietro Germi crafted a comic masterpiece in Divorce Italian Style, a 1961 black comedy that mocked the archaic Italian divorce laws along with the extreme measures one man takes to detach from his spouse. It a mordantly hilarious, as well as every other kind of hilarious, from start to finish as Germi's energetic script pursues a bungling murder plot while making a humorously acerbic commentary on class, family, the justice system The Catholic Church and Sicilian custom, all carried along by the most romantic music score of its day.Baron Cefalu (Marcello Mastroianni)has become bored with his wife (Daniella Rocca) and enamored with his 16 year old niece Angela. When she reciprocates the baron looks for a way out in a country where divorce is illegal. He eyes honor killing as a way out but has to find a way to get her to be unfaithful. The plot now unfolds with one misstep after another by Cefalu that nevertheless pays off.Shot in the sizable town of Catania, Sicily everyone from actor to extra performs exceptionally whether going into operatic outrage, trading glances, hand gestures or even crowd gathering, with wonderful naturalism. Mastroianni gives arguably the finest performance of a superb career with his iconic lothario self parody that only he could carry off in such a sincere manor. In addition he manages to transcend eras by chipping in one of the best silent performances of any era as well. The tragic Daniella Rocca is comically touching, while Leopold Trieste as a sly artist and Pietro Tordi as a lawyer give excellent turns along with all the household figures making the most of their brief scenes as well as the youthful Stephania Sandrelli transitioning from beatific to sensual.With its spirited narration and the determined energized Cefalu's zany plan consolidation Germi hits one target after the next with sharp comic precision as he swiftly covers a lot of ground.Adding enormously to the film's dark vein is the subversive employment of Carlo Ruscitelli's melodically beautiful but syrupy backdrop that may momentarily deceive us into wishing the nefarious Cefalu well.Well paced, beautifully scored, perfectly set and cast but most of all flat out funny Divorce Italian Style clicks on all cylinders from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a scorching social commentary using a jaunty allure as a beguiling front</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may sound snobbish to call this a "backwoods" spoof censuring the uncivilised marriage system not that far time ago, but the Sicily populace shouldn't take it too personal since it is a truthful recount of that provincial and religion-brainwashed era, we can only progress when we are not ashamed to face up our own shortcomings. DIVORCE Italian STYLE was a massively successful comedy at its time, with sleek camera-work in monochromatic glamour and an engaging score by Rustichelli, even conquered the demography overseas, and harvested three Oscar nominations (including BEST LEADING ACTOR, BEST DIRECTOR) with one win for its original script, quite a phenomenon for a foreign language picture.A do-nothing baron Ferdinando (Mastroianni) intends to kill his annoying wife Rosalia (Rocca), so that he can marry his young cousin Angela (a fourteen-year-old Sandrelli, it is not just incestuous, also borderline pedophiliac, the noble family's fortune is in decline, however this inglorious bent runs deeply in their blue-blooded genes). Like father like son, the film cunning reveals, his hoary father Don Gaetano (Spadaro), shares the same voyeuristic habit to the same subject within their family. So, what is Fefe's (Ferdinando's nickname in the family) plan when divorce is not an option to get rid of his wife? The only solution is to bloodily murder her during a crime-of-passion for her infidelity, for which he will only serve for some shortened years in prison. This is exactly what the story unwinds when conveniently he finds out Carmelo Patan? (Trieste), a painter recently arrives in the town, is actually an old acquaintance of Rosalia, who admires her as if she is the reincarnation of Madonna. Obviously, Fefe is a morally corrupted person, but in a comical way, viewers cannot help rooting for his murder plan thanks to Mastroianni's first-class force-of-personality, with a hovering doubt of whether he will do it or not. Injecting a sublime likableness into Fefe's stalemate, Mastroianni unleashes a superlative demeanour of drollness, his comedic knack is unparalleled in the film, who would have expect that it was under the hand of Pietro Germi, whose directorial prowess in comedy hadn't been tested at then. One of the takeaways is Fefe's habitual twitch on his left cheek, which I have a personal affinity with.Another functional trickery to render sympathy towards Fefe is Germi's caricatural portrayal of Rosalia, (Rocca, was Germi's lover then, whose career would be truncated after the breakup, which unfortunately would also traumatise her mental state), deliberately uglifies her with a prominent moustache and a manually designed unibrow, she emerges as an insufferable shrew who is also overly love-wanting. Rocca sacrifices her voluptuous appeal for being a generic laughing stock, yet, Germi unexpectedly proffers her with the most meritorious virtue amongst the cast, she is the one who is brave enough to elope with her paramour, in sheer contrast with Fefe's cowardice in nature and subjugation of the small-town's parochiality which overtly he despises. It elevates her as the most integral character, and overshadows all the others in this rotten family. That's why her denouement is rather shocking when the cruelty submerged under the farcical guise finally takes a whoop to generate something other than genuine laughters, in fact it is a scorching social commentary using a jaunty allure as a beguiling front. It is further solidified by the killing ending, literally in the last ten-seconds, utterly outsmarts our trepidation of impending bathos. Truth is, this sterling comedy again is a sound testimony that a film can be wholeheartedly diverting and at the same time, sates audience's intellectual appetite as well, well done, Mr. Germi and his team.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Matter of One's "Honor"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSING IN THE guise of a movie, this film gave us a fine example of the fine Art of Satire. While it exists on the surface as a highly interesting, captivating and truly funny story; it's much more. The method it uses is instructive and sheds light on a social condition that existed in Italy at the time. That issue was the lack of a Divorce Law in that country.WE WERE TREATED to a showing of this film on a local TV station's Sunday Night Late movie. The year was circa 1966; making this DIVORCE Italian STYLE approximately 5 years old by then. We (I) were about 19 years of age then, which means that there was a lot that we didn't understand at that time. We, of course, believed that we were big, grown-up and highly sophisticated at that age. But then again, didn't everyone think of themselves like this? (Can you say "Sophomoric", Schultz?) THE STORY CONCERNS the trials and tribulations of a Middle Class gentleman, Marcello Mastroianni, who is dealing with what is often called "Middle Age Crazy" or "Male Menopause". Although he has a very attractive Wife (Daniella Rocca), he is not content and falls for a teenage temptress (Stefania Sandrelli).THE GREATEST PORTION of the movie involves Signore Mastroianni's lamentations over his unfulfilled desires, plotting how he could 'remedy' the situation and his managing to avoid detection by all, including the girl's family. (In a bit of little used today example of Black Humour, he dodges the bullet of being discovered by her Father's receiving the wrong bit of mail, with Father's being driven to a fatal heart attack while reading it.) IN A SORT OF side bar to the main plot, we see what may be the greatest gag in the film. Folowing the denunciation and warning about the immorality and blatant sinfulness of a motion that is soon to be shown at the local movie house by the local Catholic Priest, the next scene consists of showing large numbers of locals literally running to the theatre, many carrying their own chairs.BECAUSE OF THE sentiments connected with divorce, combined with the law on its legal standing, it is accepted for an offended spouse to kill the adulterous mate. It was in turn considered a crime of passion that carried a light prison term.THE 'SOLUTION' TO his problem has Mr. Mastrioianni attempting to figuratively 'push' his wife into an affair with a former flame. The events leading up to his consummating the solution are most amusing and the setting leading to a great ending.IN THE END, the man doesn't exactly get punished for his misdeeds and fanciful philandering; but he does (or soon will) find out that there is so much truth in the old adage: "The Grass always looks Greener on the Other Side of the Fence."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You May Be Surprised By How Easily You Can Be Sold On "Divorce"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Divorce - Italian Style," released as the 286th addition to the Criterion Collection, is a film that is heavy on theme but doesn't preach to you. It's a film that is stylized but never calls attention to itself. Most importantly, it's a film that screams "classic" without so much as a subliminal whisper.Marcello Mastroianni's Baron Fernando Cefalu is a man known by all and watched by all, like any celebrity, with judgmental eyes. This is probably why he's stayed with his overbearing wife (Daniela Rocca) for fifteen years. But, as his age shows through his suave looks, he begins to question how much longer he can take it. In comes Angela (Stefania Sanderelli), his much younger cousin whose ever-so-slight passes at him force him to decide to either take a risk and pursue her or accept his current situation as a dedicated husband with a reputation to uphold. While he makes up his mind. . . he fantasizes about various ways to kill his wife, eventually finding one that's practically achievable and sets forth to make it a reality.Don't worry if this infidelity plot sounds familiar to you because the film is perfectly aware of that, even being nearly 60-years old. Also don't be concerned if such low-stakes social dramas don't interest you. In fact, that would actually make you the perfect candidate for this particular film for it's a satire, a damned great one at that.The usual complaint for the films, or harlequin romances, "Divorce" satirizes is that if the characters aren't developed that well, it's difficult to care whether the situation works out or not, especially if it involves a murderer for which it's hard enough to have sympathy for as it is. Director Pietro Germi and screenwriter Ennio De Concini set up the film in a deceptively simple way that avoids this conflict, effectively making you root for the Baron based on the situation alone-- it's even said that American audiences who saw this in its original release were laughing throughout without the assistance of subtitles because of this technique. The viewer merely needs to be introduced to the Baron as a man who can't get a wink of sleep in his own bed without telling his wife how much he loves her until she's satisfied, which is never. With that, the viewer is already thinking about their own escape plan, not realizing that the most painless strategy is murder. In a sense, the film makes you forget this too as its coying sense of humor distracts you from the horrible end task.An example of this is, after the Baron finds out that he must set up the murder to look like a crime of passion (in order to get the shortest jail sentence), he attempts to find an unknowing participant to pin an affair with his wife to. This results in him looking to anyone and everyone, from subtly alluded-to homosexuals to a man who's already having his own affair with the Baron's housekeeper, each time resulting in hilarity.It also helps that the actors are so perfectly cast here. Marcello Mastroianna is akin to the Italian Pepe le Pew, balancing his cartoonish good looks (of which he's in denial of in the film) with just enough sympathy to make his bastard character seem almost noble. To avoid commenting on what less-than-attractive physical traits Daniela Rocca brought to her character as the wife *cough* facial hair*cough*, let's just say this reviewer was convinced by her very funny performance that the Baron deserved to aim higher. Also, the supporting cast, with a special shout-out to the man who played Angela's father, absolutely nailed it as the archetypal Italian characters you would picture while listening to Adam Ferrara's stand-up comedy.The DVD, while lacking a commentary track that would be perfect for a film of this short-but-sweet length, features a good set of special features and a pristine transfer one would expect from the folks at Criterion. There were a few distracting scratches on the corners of some of the frames, but it's doubtable this was avoidable considering the film's age, though it still looks quite beautiful today. Martin Scorcese and others contribute essays to a booklet that rivals the short interviews on the supplementary disc as well, complimented by cover art by comic artist Jaime Hernandez of Love &amp; Rockets fame.Overall, this film is a masterpiece of comedy in the tone of later successes like Alfred Hitchcock's "The Trouble With Harry" and should not be missed regardless of whether you enjoy simple black humor or are looking for answers to why many of today's similar comedies ("The Bounty Hunter") fail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a dark comedy that is sure to please</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marcello Mastriani plays a total jerk in this film. His loving wife is a good woman. Perhaps she isn't beautiful (she's got quite the 5 o'clock shadow), but she cares about him even when he is obviously indifferent to her. Instead of loving her, Mastriani has fallen for his MUCH YOUNGER cousin (ewww). But, in Italy at that time divorce wasn't easily obtained, so he plans on murdering his wife. He reasons that if he convinces everyone that she was cheating on him, that his prison sentence would be pretty short and he could then marry his cousin. Well, along the way things go a little bit different than he had planned--particularly the brilliant ending of the film.This film is NOT for the sentimental or those looking for a romance. No, it is very very very cynical and dark but quite funny. Give it a look. A very funny script and lots of delicious twists make this a must-see for fans of Italian cinema. My daughter, who usually does not watch Italian films, saw this with me and absolutely adored it--saying it was now her favorite foreign comedy. While I wouldn't quite go that far, it is darn good and clever throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stunning b/w cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Sunday afternoon respite from my more usual, of late, darker and edgier, exploitation movies, allows me to watch again, after a gap of many years, this post neo-realist gem from director, Pietro Germi. Still shot in some way as the neo-realist films were, with stunning b/w cinematography, much location shooting and those streets filled with emotionally charged locals, but without the sentimentality that could mar the earlier films. A comic opera of a tale, full of family honour and dishonour, male entitlement and female subservience. Not that light for a Sunday afternoon then! but this is deftly done with light touches and strong sense of humour. The heartfelt traditions and cornerstones of Italian society, or more especially, here Sicilian are bring gently mocked. Marcello Mastroianni is masterful in the lead and Stefania Sandrelli utterly lovely as the young girl of his fancy. This was an early film for her but she is still working and was to star in the same director's later Seduced and Abandoned, Bertolucci's 1970 The Conformist and also appear in a favourite giallo of mine, Black Belly of the Tarantula.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Italian male melodrama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Divorce Italian Stlye embodies a numerous amount of film theory, as well an interesting take on the melodrama, particularly male Italian melodrama. The films contorts the theory, and also conforms to the melodrama, such as;(Contortion), It plays against the theory of moral family structure through apertures, the resolution of the family at the end has not been achieved in this film. Though is plays with an situation, in which Fefe gains the love of his younger, 16, cousin, implying older men desiring younger women, and indirectly pedofila and the desire of the man who desires youth and childhood. How this film confirms to the melodramatic theory is that the film deals and is shot in in-closed places and of the home. This is an indication of the fight or flight theory, as well as, the aspiration for freedom and assimilate to the norm. This film is shot wonderfully, being filled with many visual pleasures with a profound script to support it. The actors portray the characters of the script, giving a believable, compelling, truthful, and blissfully entertaining. Divorce Italian Style is an odd and amazing amalgamation of melodrama with black/dry humor.</fullReview>

Mastroinni, sporting a pencil-thin mustache, seems to be trying very hard to make it funny, but is let down by a witless script. Rocca, also sporting a pencil-thin mustache (no kidding), as well a uni-brow, plays the nagging wife. Sandrelli is the cousin, and nobody makes an issue of cousins having an affair (Oh those Italians!). Everybody overacts and the humor is forced and rather cartoony. Good comedies are marked by two traits - they are funny and they don't overstay their welcome. This one fails on both accounts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good movie that, alas, got on my nerves...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by declaring that I liked "Divorce, Italian Style"...sort of. I come to both bury and praise this movie at the same time, if such a thing is possible.It's not a bad film, by any means. In fact, it possesses many of the greatest strengths of foreign cinema - it's got plenty of wit, bite, intelligence, and the kind of cold insight into human nature that is often lacking in glamorized Hollywood films. In short, it's well done.And yet, it annoyed me. Something about the enormously cynical plot - which involves an unhappily married man (Marcello Mastroianni) trying to break free from his clingy wife - bugged me. Perhaps I got just tired of Marcello's world-weary persona after a while; it initially amused me, then started to grate. It's tough to watch such a superficial weed of a character for a whole movie.And perhaps I also got a little tired of the wife, who is depicted as an endlessly cheerful weirdo with a hideous unibrow and a mustache. Cheerful, and fawning. Extremely fawning. In fact, the film contains innumerable close-ups of her fawning face. But here's the problem - how many shots of a fawning woman with a hideous unibrow does any normal viewer want to see? After a while, it just got too ugly for me to look at.Perhaps I'm being frivolous. But I'm trying to suggest, in my own clumsy way, that the movie was a little too grotesque for me. The characters were a little too bizarre, the shouting was a little too loud, and the satire narrowly missed the mark. I wanted to like it, really... but it ended up irritating me. Shame, really - but I'm sure that many Italian movie buffs will love it despite my grumblings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film If You Love A Great Scheme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Divorce Italian Style is blessed with a wonderfully devious and elaborately orchestrated murder plot with an illicit advantage, organized by a man who secretly feels no pride towards his proud and scrupulous culture, which he takes full and calculated advantage of. I love it! Though I am well out of the long-lived phase wherein I was absolutely obsessed with movies about cons, heists, stings, double-crosses, and things of that sort, I am still taken by any movie with the razor sharp wit to effectively portray the sneakiest possible ruse with an advantage with no moral value but great fulfillment. I am a good person, and I do not like bad people, but I am most certainly attracted quite strongly to any display of what sneaky, manipulative people do.Divorce Italian Style lets the audience in on everything that our wicked protagonist plots. We observe, chuckling and engrossed, voyeurs with our tongues in our cheeks, as drama ensues and chaos ushers in and the only ones who have any idea are us, the observers with director Pietro Germi's effective god's eye view that he provides us with.The movie is also well worthwhile because of how lovingly and hysterically it portrays its culture. Italy is portrayed as a place where everyone is melodramatic, impetuous, outlandishly prideful, and bearing a temper the length of a millimeter. The hilarious observation of its own culture is the whole reason the scheme and the comic genius of it work so well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Divorce Italian Style is a pretty good film. It begins kind of slowly, but really picks up towards the end. It is worth seeing for several reasons, foremost among them, to see Marcello Mastrioanni in anything is worthwhile. It is also interesting culturally, although, be warned, this is not meant to be any kind of cultural document from Italy. In fact, I believe the film is taking place in Sicily because of its more conservative nature. I don't think that these customs were common even there, but the Italian public could accept it better if it were happening in Sicily. There is one part of interest to any film enthusiast: the characters in the film go to see La Dolce Vita! Of course, Mastrioanni was the star of that film (they don't show any scene with him in it). We see priests condemning La Dolce Vita and blaming the cuckolding of the main character on it. We also see a woman looking sideways at her boyfriend when his eyes are oggling Anita Eckberg. His response: "No, no, no, I don't like her. She's beautiful, but she has no soul."</fullReview>

I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, so I won't give any of these moments away.

Then Fefe goes to prison for about 3 years, then gets married with Angela. Later Angela cheats on him with the sailor who's sailing the boat they are on. The whole movie is funny since the beginning.

There were many strange customs depicted in the film that made me wonder if life in Sicily at that time was really like that or did they take liberties for comedy sake. Who cares? Who'd have thought that Marcello M could possibly be THAT funny? But he is and I can't help thinking that perhaps Peter Sellers borrowed a bit of that personality for his Inspector Clouseau. I wonder how many people realize that if you take away the murder aspect of the plot and just leave the seduction of the niece, it would be a carbon copy of Lolita.
