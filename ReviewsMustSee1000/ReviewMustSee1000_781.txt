		<fullReview>Anyone who's ever written off Marilyn Monroe as "just" a dumb blonde are directed to this film immediately. Yes, at first glance, Lorelei Lee is a brainless piece of fluff, given to such malapropisms as "Pardon me, please, is this the boat to Europe, France?" But upon closer inspection, this girl is no dummy. Rather remarkably for the chauvinist times, Lorelei and Dorothy (played by the incredibly underrated Jane Russell) do things on their own terms, and when Lorelei "plays dumb," it's because she knows that's what men expect--and she uses it to her advantage. But enough of the heavy analysing; above all, "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" is FUN! It's clearly of the Fox, rather than the MGM, school of musicals--MGM made the "art" musicals ("An American in Paris," "Singin' in the Rain"), while Fox made the "vulgar" ones ("There's No Business Like Show Business"). From the opening number ("Two Little Girls from Little Rock"), we know we're in for a visually opulent, noveau riche zircon of entertainment--witness the gaudy black, red and blue color scheme. Lorelei and Dorothy's costumes are at the extreme end of 50's fashion; designer Travilla will never go down as a contemporary of Dior or Balenciaga, but as a precursor to Bob Mackie. And yet, this is still a very funny (and essentially very warm) movie. There are few screen friendships as believable and as lovable as Lorelei and Dorothy's--maybe only Lucy and Ethel's on the small screen really surpasses it. "Let's get this straight," Dorothy warns, "nobody ever talks about Lorelei except ME." And Lorelei returns the compliment: "Dorothy is the best, loyalest friend a girl could ever have." Pretty heartwarming stuff! In a nutshell, Lorelei and Dorothy are nightclub entertainers who head for Paris when Lorelei's romance with millionaire Mr. Esmond (Tommy Noonan) flounders due to his father's interference. Shipboard, Dorothy is romanced by Malone (Elliot Reid), who, unbeknowst to the girls, is a private detective hired by Esmond to keep an eye out for potential scandal. Meanwhile, Lorelei meets Lord Beekman, aka "Piggy" (Charles Coburn), probably the dirtiest dirty old man in the history of film. Piggy just happens to own the 2nd largest diamond mine in South Africa, and soon enough, Lorelei is coveting the gorgeous diamond tiara owned by Piggy's wife, Lady Beekman (Norma Varden). Various mixups and mayhem ensues, with Lorelei and Dorothy eventually stranded in Paris. And that's where Marilyn Monroe gives her penultimate performance: the legendary "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend" sequence. Even today, after scores of parodies and tributes, this number captivates. Not since Rita Hayworth's "Put the Blame on Mame" in "Gilda" was there such an intoxicatingly sexy marriage between star, song and persona. In this number, Marilyn is by turns playful, alluring, seductive and charming, but NEVER conniving or hard-edged. And therein lies her appeal: even when proclaiming "I prefer a man who lives and gives expensive jewels!", Marilyn is never anything less than adorable. She's not a gum-snapping, man-eating golddigger; she wants pretty things, and knows how to get them--but not at the expense of being nice. She may peruse passenger lists with single-minded focus ("Any man with '...and valet' after his name is definitely worthwhile"), but she's still a likable character WITH a motivation behind her actions--which always remain entirely innocent. Special note must be made here, too, of Jane Russell's contributions to this film (not the least of which is her seen-to-be-believed solo, "Ain't There Anyone Here for Love," in which she's surrounded by posterior-pumping beefcake). It would've been very easy for Russell to either throw the film entirely to Monroe, or push too hard for her own spotlight at the expense of onscreen warmth and camraederie. Wisely, Russell does neither. She simply turns in a snappy, effortless comic performance that more than holds its own, and projects a marvelous sense of sisterhood in her scenes with Monroe. This is a small comic, musical gem; the sum is greater than its parts (the songs themselves are weak; the comedy is sometimes obvious), but you cannot deny its sheer entertainment value. This is a perfect example of star power (Monroe's AND Russell's) turning a rhinestone into a diamond.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marilyn's "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" was one of the classic musicals of the 1950's... She comes into it looking like a winner, and leaves as one? The picture has been set fully by the tone of her personality? Her personality infuses every corner of the film as if she has even picked the scenery to work for her? The movie rises above its pretext, its story, its existence as a musical, even its music, and becomes at its best a magic work, yet it is a light-hearted satire of the old adage that when a woman goes bad, men go right after her? The film crowned Monroe in her position as the nation's new 'Love Goddess' with the promise of many sparkling hits to come, and Jane Russell's career continued, with less fanfare, but very successfully for several more years? The story was simple: Dorothy (Jane Russell) and Lorelei (Marilyn Monroe) work together as entertainers and are also good friends? Lorelei's millionaire fiancé Gus Esmond (Tommy Noonan) sends the girls to France, but his father (Taylor Holmes) hires a private detective, Malone (Elliott Reid) on the same boat to spy on her during the trip? When the three meet, Dorothy falls for Malone, much to the chagrin of Lorelei, who cannot understand Dorothy's indifference to men with money? On board, the girls get into trouble when they meet an old playboy Francis Beckman (Charles Coburn), a diamond merchant?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable no-brainer of a musical with Monroe and Russell at their peak...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell are so terrific in their musical comedy roles that they make the men (Elliot Reid and Tommy Noonan) look even more pallid than they are. But let's fact it. Nobody's watching them anyway when the spotlight is on Monroe and Russell as just "two little girls from Little Rock". Fox knew what to do with the two lovelies when they cast them as the gold diggers aboard a ship bound for France with nothing on their minds but the pursuit of men with money. Jane has a wonderful song-and-dance routine with Olympic hopefuls in "Ain't There Anyone Here For Love?" and Marilyn gets to do a now-classic routine with "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend". Charles Coburn has some amusing moments as an old-timer with a yen for Marilyn who has a yen for his wife's tiara. "I just love finding new places to wear diamonds", she says in that sweetly innocent Monroe voice. And Russell tops everything off with an imitation of Monroe in a courtroom that's guaranteed to draw chuckles.It's all done up in vivid technicolor. The girls wear eye-popping costumes and look ultra glamorous together (exact opposites), and the songs aren't bad either. Pure escapist entertainment of the '50s kind with enough humorous moments to keep you entertained by the silly shenanigans. Fans of Monroe and Russell will love this one.One of the funniest moments: Monroe stuck in a ship's porthole while a little boy holds a blanket around her as she makes small talk with Charles Coburn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute 1950's Fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A gold-digging, or rather diamond-digging, "dumb" blonde, played by Marilyn Monroe, and her singing gal pal, played by the vivacious Jane Russell, provide mutual support on a love boat cruise, where they flirt with, and woo, eligible and preferably rich, men, in this musical comedy from the early 50's. The story is thin and nonsensical. But that's OK, because the film's strengths lie in its comedic script, its dazzling musical numbers, and the inclusion of the visually stunning M. Monroe, as Lorelei Lee.Superficially, Lorelei "seems" like a not very bright "babe", especially in some of her comments. For example, she counsels Russell's character by saying: "I want you to find happiness --- and stop having fun". But there is a subtle quality about Lorelei that suggests that she may be smarter than she lets on. One wonders if Monroe, who was quite intelligent and bookish in real life, was really acting in this film, or just being herself.While there are several lively, and memorable, musical numbers, they are all lead-ins to the lavish, eye-popping musical finale. On a stage adorned in garish colors (orange, pink, and black mostly), a breathtakingly glamorous Monroe belts out the popular song: "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend". Her singing (partially dubbed) is not quite as credible as the performance of Carol Channing in the Broadway version. Still, the film's finale is a cinematic spectacle, a veritable feast for the eyes and ears. "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" is not a heavy weight "message" film. It is instead a pleasant and entertaining bit of fluff, where the emphasis is on fun, music, and glamour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talk to Me, Harry Winston, Tell Me All About It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it will never compete with the likes of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, GIGI, or MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, this 1953 confection is nonetheless a real charmer. Based on a popular Broadway show which was itself based on the famous novel by Anita Loos, GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES tells the story of two cabaret performers--blonde bombshell Loreli Lee, who is determined to marry for money, and brunette beauty Dorothy Shaw, who prefers to marry for love. When Loreli's engagement to a millionaire's son goes awry, the two set sail for Europe, and comic complications ensue. The story is traditional fluff, pure and simple, and there is nothing in the least innovative or unexpected about the film as a whole--but it is all extremely, extremely well done.The score is bright, including such tunes as the famous "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"--and all the musical numbers are cleverly staged and filmed. The overall look of the film is also eye popping: the ladies are dressed to perfection and the color cinematography is truly joyous. The script is full of comfortable wit, director Hawks keeps it moving at a nice clip, and the cast includes such enjoyable performers as Charles Coburn, Tommy Noonan, Norma Varden, and George Winslow. But what really makes the film memorable are Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell, who simply sparkle with star quality and play their with roles in a twinkle-in-the-eye style.Monroe and Russell have remarkable chemistry on screen, and although neither were really singers they each had enjoyable and very distinctive singing voices; their performances are so pleasantly amusing that you can't help but smile. Both also had a way with comedy, with Monroe offering her quintessential 'not so dumb blonde' and Russell matching her all the way as the wise-to-you brunette determined to keep Monroe out of trouble. And so well do they work together it is hard to pick a favorite between the two. Call it fluff, froth, foolish--but even jeweler Harry Winston couldn't refuse this good time, even at the risk of a diamond or two. Thoroughly enjoyable for any one still capable of a smile.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You don't need to be a Marilyn fan to enjoy this wonderful film.A great light hearted comedy that pairs up Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe in their prime.The performances are outstanding- Marilyn's precision comic timing along with Jane's dead-pan delivery make for an unforgettable comedy team.At a time where men were leading the field for comedy pairings along comes Russell and Monroe and a better combination there is not!The musical numbers are terrific especially Bye-Bye Baby and the classic Diamonds are Girls Best Friend.The supporting roles are also well cast with the Charles Coburn as the Multimillionaire "Piggy" who has eyes only for Diamonds and Marilyn and the wonderful late Tommy Noonan as Marilyn's nerdish and gullible love interest Gus Edmond.If you look beyond the surface which makes this film at first appear to be a seemingly stereotypical tale of young helpless women looking for rich husbands you will actually see a story of two strong and self-sufficient women looking for what they want in life, going out to get it and not settling for less!But let's not make this any deeper than we need to... this is a FUN FILM... not meant to change the world but just to entertain you for a few hours-- AND THAT IT DOES!High ranks from young and old... Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is great family entertainment.Now, might I close with an Anita Loos quote about Marilyn Monroe in GPB:"I did not write the role Lorelei Lee as Marilyn performed it in the film, but I sure as hell wish I had!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Howard Hawks tackles a Broadway show and Marilyn Monroe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a demonstration of Hawks' versatility, this picture stands out. It's anything but a faithful adaptation of the Anita Loos story, but in Hawks skilled hands, it's as delightful and silly as his best screwball comedies, and an evocative example of the sexpot exploitation prominent in it's day. Monroe and Russell complement each other nicely as glamour babes beyond belief. The flamboyant musical numbers are deliriously fetishistic and there are some particularly hilarious bits involving a hoarse-voiced little boy and a dirty old man. Sensationally staged and provocatively primitive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marry For Love, But Get Those Diamonds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anita Loos's famous novel and play Gentlemen Prefer Blondes was done as a musical and ran for 740 performances during the 1949-1951 season. It was the breakout role in the career on Broadway for Carol Channing. But for the screen version a pair of pulchritudinous sex symbols were cast as the showgirls looking for husbands, Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe.Two things were done for the film, most of the Jule Styne-Leo Robin score was scrapped and two numbers written by Hoagy Carmichael and Harold Adamson were added. Retained from the original score was Bye Bye Baby, Two Little Girls from Little Rock and the famous theme of goldiggers everywhere, Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend. The second thing was to update the story from when it was originally written during the Roaring Twenties to the current Fifties. Still the two basic characters of Russell and Monroe remained the same. Both would like husbands, but Russell wants to marry for love, money would be nice though, but Monroe it's strictly mercenary. The two men they have an eye on are millionaire son Tommy Noonan for Monroe and Russell has her eye on Elliott Reid. Monroe's mercenary ways nearly sink the two of them, but it all kind of works out in the end.Lorelei Lee was Marilyn's breakout role as well. No big male star names are opposite here, she's only in a friendly competition with fellow sex symbol Jane Russell. Russell's contribution to the film is too often overlooked with Marilyn's legend looming over all. She more than holds her own against Marilyn and in fact unlike in some of her films, there was no friction at all with the two women.I can see why Howard Hawks was attracted to this film. The women he has in his films are tough minded and more than capable of dealing in a man's world. That Jane and Marilyn are in abundance and boy do those women have a lot of abundance.And in all the right places too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light, lively and entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lorelei and Dorothy may well claim to just be two little girls from Little Rock, but if that's the case then they certainly have no intention to remain that way. Lorelei wants a rich man regardless of looks or age while Dorothy wants good looks and a body to match. On board a transatlantic cruise on their way to Paris, the pair find plenty of both types of men but, despite temptation Lorelei genuinely intends to remain faithful to the millionaire she has already hooked ? Gus Esmond. Meanwhile Dorothy gets the attention of quite a nice gentleman who seems like he really likes her.Opening with a great bit of a sassy musical number this film goes into the credits with an atmosphere and approach that it pretty much keeps consistent throughout the whole film. The story is very much driven by the gold-digging female stereotypes of Lorelei and Dorothy and, although quite light, it does enough to keep things moving and interesting. It is greatly helped by the delivery, which is superficial, sparky and fun. The musical numbers (and indeed the whole film) are colourful and engaging thanks to the good direction from Hawks. The script provides plenty of amusing material and although it does lack depth and massive laughs, it is generally very entertaining.The cast are a big part in it and I was surprised by how good the lead pair were. I've never really rated Russell or Monroe in terms of being good actresses but here they suit their character and work off one another well. Their characters are not anything other than exaggerated cliché but they are fun none the less; they have slightly different characters but each seems to be to their strengths and they deliver the script well. The male characters are very much a side issue but generally they are well played by Reid, Coburn, Noonan and a couple of others.Generally then this is not the film to come to if you are looking for real substance and depth but it delivers the goods in regards fizz and fun. The musical numbers are colourful and entertaining, while the script is lively and benefits from good delivery from a well cast Monroe and Russell. A "classic" film that is fun over 50 years later and accordingly is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great spectacle!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think some people are too harsh on this movie. No, it doesn't saying anything revelatory about the human condition but that's not its intent. It is very good escapist fare. Monroe and Russell keep us enthralled with their glamor, song and dance numbers, and the occasional sharp one-liner. The plot is perfunctory. While Monroe is obviously the one most associated with the film in the public's consciousness, I personally think Russell is just as good if not better (I'm not saying that because I'm a brunet as well!) A question many Monroe fans ask is whether at this point onward in her career Monroe was playing Lorelei or whether in real life she 'was' Lorelei? Whatever the case, I recommend this movie if one is in the mood for glitzy glamorous Hollywood spectacle, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Female buddy movie as musical comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" presents us with the showgirls and best friends Lorelei Lee (Marilyn Monroe) and Dorothy Shaw (Jane Russell). There isn't much of a plot?just Lorelei and Dorothy taking a transatlantic voyage and running into trouble when Lorelei's love for diamonds gets her into a compromising situation?but that's enough to provide a framework for jokes and songs. Monroe is at her ditziest here, delivering all her lines with sincere, wide-eyed loopiness; Russell makes a nice contrast as the sardonic, practical Dorothy, so it's all the funnier when she imitates Monroe's cartoonish persona late in the movie.The musical numbers are just an excuse for clever rhymes, sequined costumes, and shimmying choreography, and they succeed on all charges. Monroe and Russell duet on the jazzy "Two Little Girls from Little Rock" and the plaintive "When Love Goes Wrong" (a country/blues song sung at a Parisian café). The highlight, "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" is an over-the-top riot of Technicolor, diamonds, dancers, and Monroe's insinuating, breathy vocals, though the song is also fun when Russell kicks it up in a courtroom. Then there's the hilarious "Anybody Here For Love?" which Russell performs in front of a chorus of male bodybuilders in flesh-colored briefs.What I love most about "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" is that it's a female buddy movie. Of course, in one sense, it plays into sexist stereotypes--Lorelei is a gold-digging airhead and Dorothy flirts shamelessly with any handsome guy. But in another sense, it's pretty rare for Hollywood to depict two beautiful women as friends and equals, not rivals. Although gentlemen may prefer blondes, Dorothy is never jealous of Lorelei, and despite her cynical wisecracks, she deeply cares for her. The girls will always put their friendship before romance, and help each other out of a jam. Monroe and Russell sparkle together, but lack chemistry with their C-list male costars; in the end, you feel like these guys don't deserve two such vibrant women. Kind of ironic, then, that the movie's hit song claims "diamonds are a girl's best friend," when the rest of the movie celebrates the best-friendship between Lorelei and Dorothy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who would have thought an untrained "Brassiere Model" would have it in her to steal a film from Marilyn Monroe?All you do through this film is watch Russell, and grin at her gumption. (Yeah, I said it.)Even in the famous "gay" number, that number only works because Russell is in on the joke, and plays along.Also: Howard Hawks is often referred to as misogynistic, based on the majority of male protagonists in his films.That needs to be nipped in the bud:This is the man who discovered Marilyn Monroe in "Monkey Business," and then starred her in this film. This is the man responsible for Lauren Bacall's famous screen debut in "To Have and Have Not." This is the man who directed the buddy movie that brought Louise Brooks to G. W. Pabst's attention while he was casting "Pandora's Box." This is the man who defined Katherine Hepburn's screen image when he directed her in "Bringing Up Baby." This is the man who directed "His Girl Friday," as strong an argument as I can imagine, posited in 1940, that women are the equal of any man stupid enough to cross them.To this day, it boggles my mind that the man who shaped, oh, I don't know how many of the 20th century cinema's female icons, could be considered misogynistic.But all of that aside: Jane Russell rocks this move.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marilyn Monroe is the most Iconic Sex Symbol of the Golden Age of the Movie Age, and ultimately of the 20th Century. In "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (1953) one can easily see how this thought has been brought down upon young Marilyn. The film is not only enjoyable, but contains many great memorable songs, and of course, Marilyn Monroe.Jane Russell on the other hand, brings a more mascular, homey feeling into the film, in which most audiences can easily relate too. This factor I also found very appealing.The Choreography within the film is extraordinary, and most the piece are done as if it were clockwork!Yours, julianallees 12th August, 2008 8:04pm</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It ain't deep, but my God... what a perfect piece of entertainment. In the history of people saying good-bye to a few bucks for a few hours' distraction, 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes' is some sort of historical high water mark. Overproduction ruined about ninety percent of movies in the 50s, but here it's just about right. Marilyn Monroe is handed a darned funny script which gives her one or two wonderfully dumb lines per scene as a breathy, misguided gold-digger. Witness her hysterical interactions with the wealthy Mr Spofford (just watch it). 'Bye Bye Baby' and 'Ain't There Anyone here for Love?' are perfectly enjoyable, well-executed trifles. But 'Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend' is terrific and sublime; the screen is saturated with the colors red &amp; pink, as Monroe performs maybe the best known femme-fatale number ever; and Anita Loos wry observations are retained in Jules Styne's lyrics. The movie is funny, eye-popping and charming; and infinitely better than 'How to Marry a Millionaire.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"But Square-cut or Pear-shaped, These Rocks Don't Lose Their Shape!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As pointed out the film GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES is really the first great movie role in the career of Marilyn Monroe. Given the brevity of her film career (roughly a decade), one third of it passed without her being more than...well, let's face it "male eye candy". Her sexiness and apparently "dumb blond" personality fit her just as a film decoration - an entertainment for drooling men to watch.This was hardly fair (as Marilyn did eventually prove; and as fellow movie bombshells like Jayne Mansfield rarely did). Marilyn had popped up in some films of interest: the last Marx Brother Movie (as a Marx Brother Movie), LOVE HAPPY - but only for one wasted moment; MONKEY BUSINESS (as an imagined rival to Ginger Rogers - but again wasted, as she was playing opposite Cary Grant); THE ASPHALT JUNGLE (where she was Louis Calhern's mistress); CLASH BY NIGHT (where she essayed a serious part, but was again in support to Barbara Stanwyck). I suspect it was that her physical attributes dictated the sex appeal over anything else. But it wasted one third of her film career!Marilyn was not seen to have a brain. Other blonds did show intelligence (Doris Day and Kim Novak and Grace Kelly come to mind, and all three were getting meatier roles in this period). But Marilyn could only hope for some break to take her out of the background.Anita Loos had written her novella in the 1920s, and it was a smash hit then and ever since. One really ought to read the book to understand a small difference between Loos' view of Lorelei Lee of Little Rock, Arkansas, and both the musical version of Carol Channing and the film version of Marilyn to see the improvement in the latter two. Loos was spoofing the dumb blond. Lorelei is dumb - she has no sense of the real world. She is telling her own story in the novella (by the way, Carol Channing actually did a recording of the book that is worth listening to). Lorelei is the sort of idiot who insists she was an actress in film because she was in the Babylonian palace staircase shot (with 10,000 other people) in Griffiths' INTOLERANCE. She is a good time girl - a modern flapper sans intelligence. Money and success fall into her lap (quite literally) due to her affect on men. She's aware of it, but she lacks the sense that the stage and screen versions add. Channing and Monroe both show they understand that CURRENTLY they are appealing to men, but that with aging they can't depend on this attraction to pay the bills. Monroe (in the film) may try to imagine what a tiara would look like on her in a childish way at a ship's dinner table, but she knows the security of owning such jewelry brings. The final moment that her cleverness is revealed is when she confronts Taylor Holmes (the father of her fiancé Tommy Noonan) in Paris. She openly says she is interested in Holmes' money, and that men are hypocrites because they want their daughters to marry only rich men, and don't want their sons to wind up with "gold diggers". Holmes has to admit that she is smarter than he was told, and she says she can be smart when she wants to be.The appealing thing of the film is the camaraderie between Monroe and Jane Russell. People hearing of the teaming thought the set would become a real war-zone between blonde and brunette bombshells. Instead the two actresses became lifelong friends, and their friendship translates well between that of Lorelie and Dorothy Shaw. They both are aware of their effect on men, and their need for a supporting sister figure. And they work fine as a team. Note how they handle Elliot Reid when they want to get the incriminating photos he's taken of Marilyn and Charles Coburn ("Beakie").The men do well in their parts, especially Noonan as the fretful Gus and Reid as the smart (usually) detective Ernie (he does eventually prove himself to the satisfaction of Russell). George Winslow's "Henry Spofford III" has a wonderful moment warning Monroe about that old goat's (Coburn's) intentions. Coburn is fine, usually henpecked by his overbearing wife Norma Varden. As for the loss of the Julie Styne tunes, the musical is firmly set in the 1920s and many references (to prohibition, and historically forgotten folks like actor Fiske O'Hara) are quite dim. Modernizing the tale was not a bad idea. And the two Carmichael tunes - especially Russell's number with the Olympic team - are good. It was an excellent first major part for Monroe to step into.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely are we graced with the presence of royalty, however in Howard Hawk's 1953 version of the musical by Anita Loos and Joseph Fields, we are indulged by two love goddesses of the 1950s. Lorelei (Marilyn Monroe) and Dorothy (Jane Russell) are a pair of cabaret artists looking for love and money. They form an odd couple of sorts but with killer looks. At times, they don't always see eye to eye when it comes to choosing a mate.They end up on a cruise to Paris among a bulky men's Olympic team, and wealthy African diamond miner (and his wife), a private detective, and any other rich gentlemen that Lorelei can get her mittens on. Conflicts arise when Lorelei begins chasing after other men's money while Dorothy falls in love with the wrong kind of man. They end up having to decide between a a life full of money or happiness.Monroe and Russell are knock-outs in this film; full-bodied, sassy and sultry, thanks to Hawk's sharp direction. They each play off each other's assets - Monroe, fully utilising her bodily assets playing the ditsy blonde, while the more level headed Russell provides the cynic of the pair.The script is a laugh-out-loud riot showcasing Monroe's ability to deliver dead pan lines and demonstrating she never shies away from an opportunity to make fun of herself. Plus there are many classic screwball moments that bounce the farce along.The limited amount of musical numbers are slickly directed by Hawks, well orchestrated and toe-tappingly fun, vibrant with colours, utilising a large crew of back-up singers and dancers. The music &amp; lyrics by Styne &amp; Robin are joyous and lively diversions.I recently watched this film in a small public screening as part of a "Goddess" art exhibition. It was quite an experience to have the entire theatre erupt in riots of laughter, even applauding during certain moments. While at times implausible and absurd, it's far too easy to overlook this for it's charm and opportunity to see Monroe and Hawks at their comical bests.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Classic Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell, filmed in 1953, directed by Howard Hawks is a pleasant musical heyday of Hollywood, with two very beautiful and graceful actresses who performed spontaneous and very well prepared roles that show how a beautiful woman can conquer any man with flirtatious glances and movements, while these within the materialistic philosophy of the time, as a film critique, show how money is the best arm to let her fall in love particularly if some jewels (diamonds) are included. Cheerful and jovial music, sensual dances, simple and innocent humor. Ninety minutes of diversion from a simple script that captivates and entertains the viewer. A beautiful Marilyn, innocent, naive and with great force as an actress and Jane Russell as his charming companion and contrast of her personality and intelligence. Nice film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a classic!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was engaged in this movie from the very first moment. It's one of those films that gives Hollywood a good name. A witty and lovely musical featuring two of the most talented women alive at the time, Gentlmen Prefer Blondes rules! It's the story of Lorelei and Dorothy, two lounge singers/best friends who couldn't be more opposite. They both set sail on a ship bound for a foreign country; Lorelei to make her hesitant fiancé come after her, and Dorothy to watch after Lorelei- and to have some fun for herself. They're in for more than they bargained for, though, on this ship. with the appearance of a diamond mine-owning rich man and a somewhat sneaky gentlemen friend, Lorelei finds herself in trouble with diamonds yet again... and Dorothy just might be falling in love.The movie is hilarious the entire way through. I guarantee you'll laugh out loud more than once. I know I did. Marylin Monroe is spot-on perfect as the beautiful and stupid diamond-obsessed girl Lorelei. Jane Russell, on the other hand, is perfect as the easy-going fun lover who's about to meet her match. Several excellent numbers throughout, all handled perfectly by the ladies. This film is a definite must-see for everyone of all ages. 8/10 stars! Jay Addison</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lots of lessons for women. Examples of several dumb men. As far as Marilyn, one has to be smart to play dumb. Jane was awesome. I loved Jane's number with those Olympic team hunks. 20 guys!Of course, Marilyn (Lorelei) thought that just one RICH man made up for all that. Hang on to your diamonds, ladies, and make sure you know when the market is up! Ouch, Marilyn, I wish you could have kept the tiara, or at least given it to ME!!!!!!The opening number with Jane and Marilyn singing and dancing, dressed in those beautiful red, slinky, "slit up to here" outfits, just took my breath away! To think that after all those years (1953), and until now (2006), 53 years to be exact, that act still dazzles and is so awesome. It was a very fast moving showstopper, and certainly set the pace for the story that soon was to unfold.The detective was sorta mean and a bumbler, and he just caved when he realized he didn't want to lose Dorothy (Jane). That she married him was sort of humdrum. I wished she would have held out for one (or 20!) of the Olympic athletes. That would have made more sense.At any rate, the double wedding scene was cool at the end, and I loved seeing the two brides in their white gowns, and carrying their white bouquets, singing their song. Loved it! A classic.Ever so (breathlessly)!!!!!!P.S. Happy Birthday, Mr. President, wherever you are!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn Shines, Russell Sparkles and the film is a Winner!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" is a much loved and incredibly popular film from a Golden age of Hollywood which saw such screen icons as Marilyn Monroe become household names across America, and indeed, the world. This film represents Monroe's big breakout role and is movie that made her a worldwide icon of the big screen and secured her place in Hollywood's Most Exclusive of Halls of Fame. Even looking at the film now, so many years after it's release, it's easy to see why. Everything about this film sparkles - and that's not just because it's in colour. Script, Acting and the Musical aspects are all outstanding contributors to the movie's success. Obviously some of the dialogue is dated by now, but that's hardly the film's fault when you consider how much the world has changed since it's release. No, the film still sparkles, that's for sure. And there's one big, platinum-blonde reason why this is - Marilyn Monroe. Her comic timing in this movie is simply outstanding, while it's true she does have some of the film's best lines it's also the case that she truly makes the most of them - her character is a joy from start to end. Praise too must be awarder to her co-star Jane Russell, who has equally commandeering comic skills and who hit a career high in this movie.Baisically, this film is a classic from it's era and is highly recommended. I'm currently studying Media and also Cinema and so this was a very worthwhile film to watch to learn more about it's era and I really enjoyed it. Memorable moments include, of course, the iconic performance of "Diamonds are a girl's Best Friend" courtesy of Monroe (It inspired Madonna's music video "Material Girl" - which is basically a carbon copy of the entire scene in this movie), the classic line "I Just Love Finding New Places to Wear Diamonds!" and so much more. I've also become really interested in the life and work of Marilyn Monroe as a result of seeing the movie. A must see if you're interested in Classic Hollywood or Marilyn Monroe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn and Jane Russell show what they're made of.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marilyn needs no introduction. Suffice it to say that she is perfect in what is probably the best of her "dumb blonde gold digger" roles, looks great, (As if it were possible for her to look less), has plenty of great and funny quotes, and sings the most famous of the Jule Styne-Leo Robin songs wonderfully. But let's not forget the brunette in the picture, Jane Russell, who has plenty of talent, comic timing, and yes, sex appeal herself. Her performance has a great sense of irony, she makes a great foil for Marilyn (Although it certainly is obvious that she really likes the girl), and gets ample oppurtunity to show off her own vocal chops in such songs as the low-key, showstopping duet "When Love Goes Wrong" and the somewhat kitschy "Ain't There Anyone Here For Love," sung while she wanders through a sea of Olympic atheletes wearing nothing but flesh-colored swimming trunks as they lift weights, etc., and then finishes off with a dunk in the pool that wasn't planned but was kept in the film upon viewing the rushes of the sequence. She herself is really great in both. And just how she manages to do a dead-on impersonation of Marilyn in a hilarious courtroom scene, then launch into a take-no-prisoners reprise of "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend" while still keeping her blond wig and hat squarely on her head, I'll never know.With such as these to hold out attention, the rest of the film doesn't seem like much, with the usual humdrum romantic plotline, the uninteresting supporting cast, and everything. But it's still a great musical comedy, based on the Broadway show that was in turn based on the famous Anita Loos novel. Howard Hawks' direction, while not as inspired as his "Bringing Up Baby" or "His Girl Friday" work, is lively, the costumes are great, the songs (Those that were retained from Broadway and those added for the film) are all great, and the script, while probably not including much of the wicked satire that the novel is praised for, (Unless I missed it), is funny enough. I should also mention the many classic shots of Marilyn and Jane walking side by side. What a contrast! Marilyn gives it all she's got, and Jane is so low-key about the whole thing she's reviting. What a great team these two ladies were! And, all things considered, what a great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's a Material Girl to Do?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing how far we have come in such a short time, as only half a century ago Hollywood was making movies that glamorized the assertive woman as being a gal who clawed her way up the social ladder by latching on to the first rich man she could find. Gentleman Prefer Blondes seems like a harmless comedy, but it make no mistake this pre-feminist era musical clearly states "Don't burn that bra! Push it up!"Marylyn Monroe and Jane Russell are two single babes who embark on an ocean liner bound for Europe in hopes of attracting Mr. Right. Sporting extravagant clothes by Travilla, these are two middle class ladies looking to move up a few income brackets by nabbing a well-to-do gentleman.Marylin's character Lorelei is the more aggressive of the pair. She is relentless in her search, going ape when she spots an older man with a diamond mine. Jane plays Dorothy, the more sensitive, but brassy one. Trouble brews when Lorelei gets involved with the diamond mine owner. As it turns out, Jane's love interest has been hired to spy on the millionaire by his jealous wife. Lorelei and Dorothy learn that pictures have been taken of the illicit affair and they create a scheme to clear their millionaire and Lorelei from any wrong doing. Unfortunately, Lorelei's passion for diamonds brings out her stubborn side, and that makes for an even bigger mess.This is a classic Monroe film, offering some of her most famous moments. The 'Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend' number is fabulous and completely sums up the theme of the story. Monroe's acting ability is certainly not challenged here. She plays the bubbly blonde that she has become legendary for, this time proving that there are some brains underneath all that dye.Russell is a good match for Monroe, her natural moxy complimenting Monroe's airy delivery. She also manages to stand out, even against the ever glamorous Marylin. The image of her dancing around a gymnasium, waving two ping pong paddles at ignorant muscle boys, as she sings about her own problems with love is very hot!Gentleman Prefer Blondes is a must see for Marylin fans, and a great waste of time for anyone that likes fluffy movies. Every aspect of the film has fun written all over it. The musical numbers are upbeat, the sets and the costumes are colorful (not to mention, over the top) and the performances are great. This is schmaltzy 1950's film making at its best!And let's be realistic for just a moment. There is a little opportunist in all of us just itching to get out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>solid fun 1920s style comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is exactly what it appears to be ? fun, sexy, escapist entertainment that trades on our cynicism while ultimately appealing to our sentiment. The phrase "they don't make 'em like this anymore" does apply to this film, but it's interesting to note that the film actually would have struck many viewers of its time as nostalgic.You might think that combining Marilyn Monroe (as Lorelei Lee) and Jane Russell (Dorothy Shaw, an unlikely bosomy chaperone) in the same frame might cause the silver screen to spontaneously combust from oversex. The danger is great, though, especially when the duo sing Jule Styne's memorable "Little Girl from Little Rock". The plot is extremely thin of course ? Lorelei is supposed to behave herself because she has a rich fiancé in the States, but you can't stop a good girl from having some good fun. Russell's character isn't a gold digger like Lorelei; not that she's the intellectual type necessarily, but she wants some real romance and prefers the hunks of the Olympic swim team to the prune-like rich older man "Piggy" (Charles Coburn) Lorelei sets her sights on. Meanwhile she gets involved with a guy who's been hired by Loreli's guy, a relatively unconvincing romantic lead in a film that is definitely defined by its female go-getters.The music, most of it from the show by Jule Styne and Leo Robin and the rest by Hoagy Carmichael and Harold Adamson, is top drawer Broadway stuff. The show itself was designed as a showcase for the young Carol Channing, and Monroe doesn't possess her vocal chords or her particular energetic style, so some of the songs were removed or altered. Monroe and Russell can't really sing or dance with the best of them, and that's the film's main weakness as musical entertainment. But in terms of the film's main function ? as a comedy of manners with some song and dance ? they are fine. The film has some additional value historically speaking because of Monroe's iconic status and it features her in her most famous musical number, "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend", but a lot of viewers will probably share my opinion that Ms. Russell was just as impressive in the film. Monroe does get a lot of the memorable comic bits, best of all a scene where the kid helps her fool Piggy as she's slipping out of the detective's room.On the topic of the film as nostalgia, there are many signs of this although some contemporary audiences are bound to miss it. The play was even moreso, actually, because it featured a song called "Keepin' Cool with Coolidge" that would have harkened back to the carefree days just before the depression of the 1930s. It's actually a bit surprising that this was the first musical directly based on Anita Loos' story from the period because the non-musical play was such a big hit which spawned numerous musical and comedic imitations (most prominently Cole Porter's "Jubilee" and "Anything Goes" and the Ryskind/Kaufman "Animal Crackers").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn's BEST...hands down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marilyn Monroe gave "finer" performances in "Bus Stop," "The Prince and The Showgirl" and "Some Like It Hot" but "GPB" is the most out-and-out- delightful entertainment of her career. The film that established and then defined her stardom and appeal.It is also one of the very few major MM vehicles in which she plays a character who is the film's catalyst--and a character without any comic or melancholic autobiographical references. This endearing gold-digger bears no resemblance to the off-screen actress, who disdained real jewelry and fought for "respect" not money. Although Monroe was still creatively hobbled by a Russian "acting coach" who demanded over-enunciation, this affect works for social climber Lorelei Lee. (This odd way of speaking came and went, depending on the how secure MM felt with her script and director. Later, it would vanish, after the Russian was shipped off. "GPB" is a relaxed performance, with the vocal oddity just enough present to give Miss Lee a kind of surreal fascination--is she from Mars?) The film is mercifully brief, with one outrageous adventure tumbling upon the next.(It begins in spectacular fashion, with both women in song and dance, and before you know it, it is over and the viewer is left slack-jawed with with admiration for the inspired fun!) Monroe is dazzlingly costumed by Travilla, luminously photographed in the rich Technicolor of 20th Century Fox,and given the best leading man of her career--the admirable Jane Russell. In no other movie is Monroe so tenderly looked after, so well-understood, or treated with such respect as she is by her best bosomy bud here. That Russell has also never been better on screen--despite some unflattering costuming and her own gracious handing over the film to MM--is the icing on this scrumptious cinema cake."GPB" looks even better now than it did 1953--certainly a far more entertaining musical than a lot of the pretentious, over-reaching MGM entries of the 40's and 50's.Two musical numbers stand out. Russell's "Ain't There Anyone Here For Love" which is both a celebration of her character's lusty womanliness and an ode to homo-eroticism--all those guys in their flesh-colored briefs, gyrating. (Gives some pause to where Howard Hawks' head was!) And of course, Monroe's immortal "Diamond's Are a Girl's Best Friend"--the apogee of her special lure, her physical perfection, her confidence--her life, probably! She couldn't dance, but Jack Cole knew what to do to make it seem as if she did. She could, however, sing--very well indeed. (Her second film, 1948's "Ladies of The Chorus" had already proved that.) But by '53, she had stylized her native gift, producing a unique and unmistakable sound. Lionel Newman, who worked with MM on all her Fox musicals has reported she was never late, never a problem, and never, ever needed to be dubbed, "not one single note, ever." I make a point of this, because IMDb. trivia on "GPB" indicated Marni Nixon did MM's high notes. (In her famous "Happy Birthday, Mr. President, MM shakes out of her drugged nervousness to hit one brief high note, quite similar to her trilling in the opening of "Diamonds.")Even if you don't much care for Monroe, it is almost impossible not to be wildly amused by this most carefree, colorful and satisfying musical romp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At the risk of sounding metrosexual ? Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is fabulous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the risk of sounding metrosexual ? Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is fabulous. It is a Technicolor musical in the eye-popping spirit of Singing in the Rain. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes stars Marilyn Monroe as Lorelei Lee and Jane Russell as Dorothy Shaw, two showgirls on their way to Paris via cruise-ship ? and there is your plot. Lorelei hopes to marry a rich man because he is rich and Dorothy is her friend ? and there is your character development. Ernie Malone is a private eye hired by Gus Esmond's father to dig up dirt on Lorelei so he can forbid his son from marrying. Malone manages a photo of Lorelei in the arms of an old diamond mine owner Sir Francis 'Piggy' Beekman ? and there is your plot twist. In the final scene (as if I need to say it) Lorelei and Dorothy walk down the aisle to marry ? and there, of course, is your resolution. The film has all the substance of a cream puff; yet, it is fabulous.Most prominently Gentlemen Prefer Blondes has fantastic songs and musical performances (most famously Monroe's Diamond's Are a Girl's Best Friend.) Though for my money Russell is the better musical performer. For me it is like Chicago where Catherine Zeta Jones, the brunette co-star, out performed (and out sex-appealed) the blonde, top-billed star. Rene Zellweger was that blonde in Chicago.Next, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is surprisingly sexy for 1953. Further (and I'm not sure about this) it displays more skin (both male and female) than any film that preceded it. The dresses Monroe and Russell wear in the opening scene still shock. Plus there are many cleverly placed and innocently spoken double-entendres (such as the girls discussing the bugle in Esmond's pocket while he watches them perform). And most startling is the homoerotic dance number featuring basically nude male dances representing the US Olympic team. This is also the best song and dance number in the film ? it is the sexy bookend to Monroe's Diamonds Are a Girl's Best friend toward the end of the film. (It would be interesting for a pop-culture historian to discuss if the homoerotic elements in Russell's song were at all obvious to the 1950s audience ? or if society as a whole was too closeted to even acknowledge it. I'm betting on the latter, otherwise I cannot imagine it getting past the censors.) Director Howard Hawks makes the interesting choice to present Monroe's character as self-consciously superficial and proud of it. A fitting choice, in that the film itself is self-consciously superficial ? there is nothing (internal to the film) to consider after watching it. Monroe famously states, "It is just as easy to love a rich man as a poor man", and that is all the film is about ? her marrying the rich man.There is, surprisingly, quite a bit to consider external to film ? both culturally and within film history. Primarily is how boldly and without emotional conflict Monroe's character espouses her life theory ? get rich by marring a rich man, love be damned. Lorelei is unapologetic and open about her pursuit, disclosing her intentions not only to Dorothy but also to Esmond (and his Dad). The feature song and dance number "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" is Gentlemen Prefer Blondes version of Gordon Gekko "greed is good" speech in Wall St. (I'm sure historians could make a number of boring points about capitalism vs. socialism and 1950s cold war policy at this point.) Further Hawks makes sure Lorelei does not learn anything along the way. She does not fall in love with Esmond, nor does she find anything admirable in Esmond aside from his money. In a very odd way she is an unapologetic woman of her convictions, telling both her finance and his father, I'm marrying in for the cash and don't you think I'm worth it? But you really need not think beyond the screen to enjoy this film. It is pure candy ? so just lean back, smile and take in the Technicolor sweets.Should you see it? Fabulously on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes 1953, sharp, and so clued into the times.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other than Ridley Scott's brilliant Thelma And Louise 1991, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes has to rank as one of the finest films where the girls actually out buddy buddy the men!!It would seem that a chief complaint with the film is that it has no similarity to Anita Loo's Broadway musical? And whilst I'm one for pounding on films for missing out crucial parts of source novels, I have no frame of reference as regards this film's original source so therefore view with untainted eyes as it were.Watched this last night and grinned throughout with the cheek of it all, I mean it really shouldn't work because on the face of it it is just a couple of showgirls taking a trip, but the blatant use of stereotypes for these two ladies is very funny indeed. Monroe is absolutely perfect for the role of Lorelei, a woman purely out for the sparkle of diamonds and a man's bank balance, she is as much shallow as she is to die for gorgeous. Jane Russell is sublime here, her Dorothy Shaw is witty and sophisticated and very protective towards her friend, yet she also needs to be loved and this shines out amongst the sarcasm and sharpness of her tongue.The film works to me on more than one level, it works as a sugar and sweet musical with glamour girls to feast my eyes upon, but it also works as a sharp piece of work when taking into account the time it was made. The 50s {my research and my parents lead me to believe} were very much the time of family values being paramount, yet around the time of this film's release, sex was becoming more of a topic to the people of the street. Playboy with my Marilyn on centre was about to turn heads, and of course Kinsey and his report was just around the corner. So upon watching Gentlemen Prefer Blondes now I can't help thinking that Howard Hawks had his finger firmly on the pulse by throwing away the big show time of the source, and then making a film that saw the wind of change with peoples attitudes.Not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but we get some tidy numbers from the girls, some sharp dialogue coupled with hilarious visual comedy. A very smart and astute film that's knowing of the times a changing, and featuring a dynamic Female duo to rank with the best that cinema has to offer. 7/10</fullReview>

The rough and tough Howard Hawks knew how to establish contact with his feminine side and when he did, wonderful things took place. "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" is a perfect example of that. One of the rarest. The women, as made abundantly clear by Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell, are divided in two very specific categories: blonds and brunettes. The blonds are always trying to find new places where to wear diamonds, the brunettes may fall for the wrong guy just because love gets in the way. The men are old rich predators, sneaky pros or children, no matter how old. The film goes by at an incredible pace and you can't help but surrender to the charm, the beauty and the knowing innocence of this masterpiece.</fullReview>

Marilyn's determined to marry a rich heir but his father has hired a private detective to prove the beautiful blonde's just after his money. Jane tries to protect Marilyn and keep her out of trouble while the two travel to Paris.Marilyn's pitch-perfect as the gold-digging Lorelei Lee. She played the 'dumb blonde' better than anybody in movie history. It's impossible not to like her, even when she's doing things you might not agree with. Jane's never been better than here playing Marilyn's sassy man-crazy best friend. Charles Coburn is the horny owner of a diamond mine. Child actor George Winslow steals every scene he's in. Tommy Noonan is fun as Marilyn's fiancé. Elliott Reid is the weakest part of the cast as the private detective who falls for Jane. He's just so stiff and corny that I couldn't see what a great dish like Jane Russell could see in him. He looks like a Fed.Lots of great lines and scenes. Possibly the best thing about the movie is just how gorgeous it looks. I'm not just talking about the leading ladies, who are both stunning. The Technicolor just pops off the screen. One of my favorite movies of all time. It'll make you smile from start to finish. Colorful, funny, sexy, with enjoyable performances and wonderful songs. Includes one of Marilyn's defining moments - "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend." An absolute must-see classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monroe and Russell shine in this classic musical comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES is the sparkling 1953 musical comedy based on the Broadway musical that made Carol Channing a star and here does the same thing for another blonde...namely Marilyn Monroe. Monroe shines in the ultimate dumb blonde role: Lorelei Lee, who along with best pal Dorothy Shaw (Jane Russell) are a couple of showgirls being tailed by a private detective hired by the father of Lorelai's latest beau, to get the goods on her. The razor-thin plot is so not the issue here. The issue is the performances by the film's stars that absolutely light up the screen. Monroe, in particular, found the role of a lifetime here as Lorelei Lee, the seemingly dim-witted gold digger with a nose for diamonds and rich men, who has no shame about using her obvious physical assets to get what she wants. This is the role that most people look to when they say that Monroe was just a "dumb blonde", but if you watch closely, Monroe is just playing a "dumb blonde" and doing it better than probably anyone ever did. And never was there a clearer example of why the camera just loved Monroe.Though the film is clearly Monroe's showcase, Jane Russell never allows herself to be blown off the screen and performs impressively alongside Monroe as the wisecracking Dorothy Shaw. Russell proves to have the same skill with a wisecrack that actresses like Thelma Ritter and Eve Arden did.Elliott Reed, Tommy Noonan, Charles Coburn, and young George Winslow offer solid support in supporting roles as the various men (and boys) involved in the misadventures of Lorelei and Dorothy.Musical highlights include the ladies' opening number, "Two Little Girls from Little Rock", "Bye Bye Baby", "Ain't Anybody Here for Love?", and Monroe's iconic "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend", a number that has become a permanent part of cinema pop culture.Aided by breezy direction from Howard Hawks, this is a delightful musical comedy classic which features two beautiful and talented ladies front and center at the peak of their charm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two of the bombshells of their time in the same movie turn in enjoyable performances as the wry and clever Dorothy and the effervescent Lorelei. With the two of them capably steering the ship the amusing lines and fun songs are a treat to watch. It is a glitzy musical, making for wonderful spectacle from beginning to end. It is also a bold choice for the time, posing such theories as the fact that it's possible to be both a wide-eyed innocent and intelligent, or that one can love a man and his money. Or that a pragmatic and wise-cracking character can be swept off her feet without losing any of the qualities that made her unique and funny to start with. Modern romantic comedy could stand to learn a lesson from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gentlemen May Prefer Blondes, But Marilyn Prefers Diamonds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd never really cared much for Marilyn Monroe before I saw "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." For me, sex appeal is arrived at naturally, and Monroe was the definition of manufactured sex appeal. I never understood why people were smitten with that silly, affected baby girl voice, or that vapid way of wandering across the screen as if in a daze.But then I saw her performance in Howard Hawks' musical comedy from 1953, and particularly her famous number "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend." And I experienced one of those all-too-rare moments that occur while watching a movie, in which an actor's screen presence catapults itself right off of the screen and into your lap, and you understand how he or she became a legend. In that number, Monroe, singing a cynical song about the only way for women to guarantee a life of security in a world where men have created the rules, is cute, charming, engaging and, above all, savvy, which is something her usual dumb-blonde persona didn't allow her to be very often. I was watching that scene and thinking: "So THIS is why people like Marilyn Monroe." Maybe Howard Hawks just knew what to do with her, and saw that underneath the bombshell there was a sharp and funny cookie waiting to come out. She's a delight in this film, which itself is pretty much a delight on its own. Jane Russell is Monroe's gal pal, and while she never looks remotely comfortable doing anything that requires her to move, especially in the musical numbers, she's great at standing still and delivering acerbic one-liners."Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," for all its frivolous exterior, is an unusually sharp critique of sexual politics in the 1950s. If I taught a class on 1950s culture as reflected and/or criticized in film, this movie would be on the syllabus.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Such a difference a half century makes - all the way around. This was quite the picture in it's day, still mentioned on many Top Film Lists, and I can't say that I didn't find it entertaining enough to watch all the way through. But it really makes you think about where we've come from and where we're at now as a society and as a movie going public. Russell and Monroe were at the top of their form here, but the form (as they used to say in those Lucky Strike commercials of the era) was 'so round, so firm, so fully packed'. I've noticed it before in other pictures, and I dare say I don't think Russell and Monroe would have made it in 2010 on their physical assets. Today's profile is a lot leaner, and it takes more than looks to make it as an actress. (I'm not counting Paris Hilton here, even if she appeared in a few flicks herself).Another issue regarding the subject matter - where did you ever see the male treated like such a sex object before? Or since? And correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't it look like this Olympic team was already past retirement age? But Russell and Monroe play their roles with relish, and for the most part they're doing it with style and class. Monroe especially seems to stay in character throughout the picture - "I just love finding new places to wear diamonds". She knows right down to the penny that fifteen thousand dollars is worth an hour and forty five minutes. Which makes it believable that she could get old Piggy (Charles Coburn) to toe the line any way she wanted. You might say that she had him by the jewels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>like a big wad of Bubblicious Bubble-Gum, great to chew, sweet flavor, not very substantial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard Hawks is usually known for being about the most professional storyteller you can get without it being John Ford (and, usually, not quite as hard-bitten sentimental as 'Pappy Ford'). This may explain some of the surprise that Gentlemen Prefer Blondes has perhaps the weakest story of the major films I've seen from the director. It's just very... whatever. A couple of dames- Jane Russel and Marilyn Monroe- take passage on a ship heading to Paris, and the whole time they either try and get some diamonds out of an old guy, or get in trouble with a diamond-old-guy scandal. That's about it, more or less, and in all actuality I wonder if that was the point Hawks was going for. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes's strength is not in story but in surface, in glamor, in showing off his two stars with a sharper-than-the-movie-deserves script and great style and peak-of-beauty appeal.Now, as far as how the two stars fare in the picture, I would probably mark it as this: Russel is really the better actress (or at least appears to really bite more into her two-dimensional part than Monroe with her 1 1/2 dimensional part), while Monroe might edge out as being the more visually stunning. It's a given to say Marilyn Monroe was iconic in a kind of wondrous/superficial stature, but it's one that Hawks knows well and exploits- or shows off, whatever- and it works to the film's benefit even when one can not quite endure her singing or her acting very much (this isn't to say she's a bad actress, just more-so relying on newfound star power). And there great looks are contrasted with a screenplay that allows for a lot of witty, barbarous Hawksian conversations and arguments, and even a crazy little turn of events where a supposed rich man turns out to be a little boy (Spofford III).Gentlemen Prefer Blondes isn't a great Hawks movie, nor really a great musical or comedy. But there are definitely great things about it, things that are so ingrained in public consciousness that they bare watching in original form to see how well they hold up. While one may find it slightly homo-erotic to see the scene with the men at the gym sequence, it's still a wild but expensive marvel to see Monroe in the 'Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" number, which is the epitome of glamor and striking at the 'Gold-digger' theme of the picture. It caps off beautifully what has been a fun, shallow and breezy picture that without its stars- or somewhat steadfast director- would be forgettable fluff. Certainly more of a treat for the ladies than the men, but it may depend on the fan of Monroe as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although both Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russel give wonderful performances, I think it no coincidence that Marilyn's career skyrocketed while Jane's waned after the release of GPB. At the time of the filming both women were considered the reigning Hollywood sex goddesses, Marilyn the blonde bombshell and Jane the buxom brunette. But Marilyn blow's Jane off the screen in GPB. Not only is she the better actress making Jane's performance appear wooden and slow, but her curvaceous beauty makes Jane look awkward and bovine. Jane suffers by comparison to Marilyn whenever they share the screen while clad in sexy costumes. Still its a great movie to see with both women at the absolute top of their game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is irresistible. What an eyeful! The costumes, the song and dance numbers, the dazzling Technicolor - not to mention Marilyn and Jane. Hard to imagine another movie more than half a century old that holds up as well as this for entertainment value. Never designed to be taken seriously, the film inadvertently makes a strong statement about women's place in our society both then and now. Any doubts about Miss Monroe's place atop the list of Hollywood icons are dispelled by the stunning piece of performance art that is "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend." And watch out for Jane's star power, especially in the startlingly gay "Ain't There Anyone Here For Love?" I'm puzzled as to why one of the filmed dance sequences was cut. The girls appear briefly in the outfits, and the trailer shows them performing. Hope someone can rescue that lost gem. Run, do not walk, to see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For any charting the origins of the cliché "don't judge a book by its cover", films like Gentlemen Prefer Blondes must have proved excellent early examples. Inspection of the film's poster, emphasizing pink and the suggestively positioned bodies of its luscious female stars would leave the viewer prepped to expect yet another example of the frothy romantic comedies Marilyn Monroe established herself as an icon starring in during the 1950s. However, rather than the superficial fluff it is often dismissed as, while it may function as such, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes demonstrates surprising subtle underlying complexity to its extravagant exteriors, making it one of the more memorable and enjoyable entries to the genre of its era.However, while deceptively complex it may be, consistent the film is not, being comprised of an an odd myriad of cinematic and thematic contradictions which somehow manages to remain charming and infectiously entertaining throughout in spite of it all. These seeming paradoxes are discernible on numerous fronts: while director Howard Hawks retains his general tendency for interpersonal relationships usually being fast talking (the film's screwball style lightning quick dialogue exchanges are hilarious), caustic and often thriving on unhappiness, he simultaneously attempts to inject real pathos into the film's midsection (which lags somewhat) and attempts at genuine jubilant joy for the ending. This grasping at more conventional, forced emotion rather than Hawks' typical smarmy cynicism and dark irony makes the film feel somewhat imbalanced, but it is saved by the consistent sense of fun keeping it aloft throughout. Similarly, the moralistic stance of the film flip-flops throughout, alternating between satirically sending up the opulent lifestyles the two gold-digging protagonists seek and relishing them, basking in the glitz and splendour of hedonistic wealthy excess.Even the musical component to the film feels sporadic, as the pacing between the musical numbers interspersed throughout the narrative is erratic, some being nearly back to back and others having large expanses of time between them, as if Hawks only decided partially through filming to make the film a musical rather than planning his song and dance interludes beforehand. Nonetheless, once they turn up, the song numbers do not disappoint. Despite not being the most memorable compared with other entries in the genre, the cheeriness, exuberance and sheer fun factor make up for it in spades, Monroe's timeless "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend" being the highlight, though Russell's "Is there Anybody Here for Love" proves a delightfully subversive take on gender objectification by having a scantily clad chorus of men paraded around instead of women). However, inconsistencies and all, the film is kept aloft by its consistent sense of irreverent fun, making the occasional bout of complexity all the more welcome, serving to differentiate the film from its many contemporaries with simpler aims and establishing it as one of the more intriguing genre examples of its time.The casting of Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe proved the film's defining element, the two sharing pitch perfect chemistry and serving to ably demonstrate two examples of strong, capable female characters in a genre far too often plagued with submissive females. Despite their superficial aims, Russell and Monroe know exactly what they want and how to get it , and the viewer can't help but cheer them on, dubious motives or not. The two also make a sublimely comedic double act, with Russell's motormouthed assertiveness perfectly counterbalancing Monroe's bubbly, naive persona (although the case can be made for her allegedly simple-minded floozy being a crafty act, with lines such as the titular quote suggesting ulterior motives behind her silliness). Charles Coburn also raises several hearty laughs as the obscenely stuffy millionaire affectionately dubbed "Piggy", and Elliot Reid makes for a wonderfully subversive potential love interest figure, always ready to contribute a sarcastic wisecrack or cynical comment.Despite structural and thematic inconsistencies and the occasional bout of unnecessarily contrived emotion, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes asserts its place as one of the most delightful and memorable musicals of its time, mainly because of subtly subversive subtexts and the charming chemistry between the two radiant leads. For any in search of an enjoyable, witty and sophisticated vintage comedy with some extravagant musical numbers thrown in for good measure, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes should prove an ideal pick.-8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Undoubtedly this is one of the sexiest movies ever.Jane Russell with Marilyn Monroe.. Honestly.. Who wants more ?! Maybe two of the greatest beauties in history, and here you have their magic together for the first and last time.Although Marilyn is making a parody of herself, but it was too rare and very wonderful. Yes, she is a fool, but do you like Madonna or Sharon Stone's malignity ?? My legendary fuss and anger is about that specific deleted number of the movie, which you can watch a photo of it simply in the main posters where both the 2 leading ladies are wearing a black swim suits.In the movie, there is that scene right after "When Love Goes Wrong, Nothing Goes Right" number, when the French taxi driver is watching a poster with the same photo, and soughs (for me I was crying!!) and in the next scene here we have our 2 stars, in the same gown, without any dance at all ??!! Where is that dance ?? Would it be the censorship ? Or the bossed producers ? I don't know at all!! But the thing I know for sure that I want to watch this incredible volcanic dance.Wish me luck to find it someday.P.S: There is a great furor about the sexiness of "Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend" number ??! I find it not sexy at all !! Not even the remakes; whether from Madonna, or the very thin Nicole Kidman. Maybe it is that good for the Americans only.</fullReview>

This is not on the Diamond Collection DVD set but, on the CD of the Diamond Collection, there is extra music on the "Anyone Here For Love" number. Jane Russell sings with 3 girls. Wow, there are no girls in that scene. There were plenty of new songs written for the film. Some even got recorded by Jane and Marilyn. When will Fox let these gems out of the vaults?

		<fullReview>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953): Dir: Howard Hawks / Cast: Marilyn Monroe, Jane Russell, Charles Coburn, Elliott Reid, Tommy Noonan: Fetching musical about romance as an object to snare its victims. Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell play Broadway sensations who board a cruise. Monroe's current beau worries that she will be targeted for scandal thus threatening their relationship already disapproved by his father. Russell becomes involved with a private investigator out to conclude a case involving missing jewels. Intermixed with various musical numbers, most notably 'Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" belted out by Monroe. Director Howard Hawks transcends music and humour successfully. His range goes from gangster films with Scarface: Shame of a Nation, to screwball comedies with Bringing Up Baby, to film noir with The Big Sleep. Monroe and Russell exchange hilarious dialogue from Monroe's absent-mindedness to Russell's sarcasm. Russell will protect her friendship at any cost, and Monroe must prove herself. Charles Coburn and Elliott Reid make great foils. Coburn is a married wealthy playboy enamored with Monroe. Reid is the private eye who ends up falling for Russell. Tommy Noonan plays Gus, Russell's previous love who is a nerd controlled by his upper class family. Theme regards spellbinding romance among other things gentlemen don't grasp.

		<fullReview>It doesn't get much more iconic than Marilyn Monroe, who is quite possibly the most recognizable celebrity in history. And "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" is one of her most iconic movies. While definitely a product of the time, the movie is still as entertaining and as adorable as ever. Marilyn stars alongside the equally beautiful Jane Russell in this musical, Technicolor journey from America to Paris on a cruise in the Atlantic Ocean. One of the biggest strengths in this film are the musical numbers, one of which may be Marilyn's most iconic performance in a film, "Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend." But my personal favorite has to be the first one, in which the ladies sing about being girls from Little Rock. It comes before the credits, and is a great opener to grab your attention.The film isn't perfect, though. The plot is incredibly predictable. You can tell what's going to happen at the end about 10 minutes into the movie. But I don't think this movie is really going for a good story; it's just a fun musical with gorgeous sets and actresses and humor, while dated, can still make you laugh.It's a must for fans of these 1950's Hollywood musicals, and it's probably the best one I've seen yet. While not as bold as something like "Mary Poppins" or "The Wizard of Oz," "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" is still an enjoyable motion pictures with iconic actresses and wonderful music numbers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jane Russell Stole the Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Date: August.12, 2012 -First Time Watch- With the fiftieth anniversary of Marilyn Monroe's death, TCM ran a marathon of Marilyn Monroe's movies and this happened to be one of the movies they picked. The story follows two showgirls, Lorelei (Monroe) and Dorothy (Russell). Lorelei is engaged to a wealthy guy (a bit of a nerd if you ask me) who's father does not approve. While her fiancé tries to convince his father to let him marry Lorelei, Lorelei and Dorothy take a cruise to France. Of course nothing goes as plans and the two girls are launched into a series of laughter. To be honest, Jane Russell steals the show. She seems like the kind of person you would want to be around you. She's fun, crafty and smart, everything that Lorelei needs to help her getting through this cruise. I can also see why in real life Monroe and Russell became friends. They had such good chemistry in the movie that it's unfortunate that didn't do another movie together. This movie provides plenty of laughter and you have to check out Monroe's iconic 'Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend' part.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes it's not about the theme.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953): The film has one element that had dated, and that's the theme. The film is trying to give a light study at women and men when it comes to sex and marriages. Unfortunately the descriptions aren't really correct to these days standards.But the thing is, is this a film about themes? Is this a film that is trying to give us a correct study? I don't think so. The movie is more about the screwball comedy, the music. And of course, the absolutely brilliant performance done by Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe. Howard Hawk's directing skills shows in this film too, with fast witty dialogue and some brilliantly directed scenes, such as the 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend' musical moment, which might have been one of the greatest musical sequences I have seen in my whole life, and which also had a Minelli styled color effect to it.We must also thank the acting. The funny thing is, Jane Russell was supposed to be the lead of the film, and Monroe just a supporting performance. And yet, Monroe shines through the whole film. There was once a saying, that Monroe can brighten any scene that she is in, and that is quite true. Every time she comes into the scene, there is going to be something about the scene in which you just can't help but to smile. This is her second best performance in her whole career, the best being her performance in 'Some Like it Hot', which is another film that she brightens up even though it's in black and white. The reason her performance is great in this film is that she has made the iconically clichéd character, the dumb blonde. Anna Faris, Paris Hilton, they have all mastered that character, and they have Monroe to thank for. Of course, that doesn't mean Jane Russell did a terrible job, with her snappy delivery, her brilliant dancing, and of course, the scene in the court room where she does a satire of Monroe's character, slow talking, trying to be sexy character.The film has of course, dated a bit, with a theme that doesn't really hold up in this time (With 'Some Like it Hot', the theme was that men and women can never become each other, so love is the only way. We can see that the theme is still holding up to this day with films like 'When Harry Met Sally'). But there is one thing that will stand the test of time in the film, and that's the simple image of Monroe herself. With the humor and the brilliant directing all wrapped up around her and Russell, this film will last a long time as a delightful screwball comedy.3.5/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's funny that almost 60 years after this movie was released, it is still getting spoofed, re-done, and remembered more as a Marilyn movie than the film version of a hit Broadway musical focusing on the adventures of TWO women. Sure, there are tons of differences between the original Broadway Lorelei (Carol Channing) and the sultry Marilyn, but the role of Lorelei Lee dates back to a play and a silent movie of the 1920's, straight from the Best Selling story of the not-so-dumb blonde and her pal Dorothy. Having seen two stage versions of this (Los Angeles 2002 with Alice Ripley and Valarie Pettiford; New York 2012 with Megan Hilty and Rachel York) and having had the pleasure of seeing this at the anniversary of Chinese Grauman's Theatre (with Jane Russell present), I actually prefer the character of Dorothy, but find it funny that the brunette (who gets the husband in Anita Loos's follow-up) is constantly overlooked. In all of the versions I've seen, I find that it is Dorothy who has the heart, is less of a "female", and undoubtedly more of a catch. No offense against Lorelei; She is fun; It's just Dorothy who gets my vote.The movie is a bit different than the Broadway show, especially the absence of most of its songs. The replacements aren't bad, but with Jule Styne as composer, why replace them in the first place? The story of the tiara bought by Lorelei with money borrowed from the husband of the tiara's owner is intact, and hysterically funny, with Charles Coburn ("I say!") delightful as the hot under the collar Lord whose imperious wife (Norma Varden) really means business. "Then why are you wearing that hat?", Russell snidely asks her. Some of the characters names remain the same as in the stage production, but the name of the little boy who helps Lorelei out of a porthole was actually an adult whom Dorothy chases in the play.Both Monroe and Russell are truly likable, and from the moment the show opens, their duet of "Two Little Girls from Little Rock" (just one on stage) sets the tone. Both stars get a chance to shine in the show's most recalled number, two renditions of "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend", Russell's obviously less splashy since hers is just a reprise. Her "Ain't There Anyone Here For Love?" is an acceptable replacement for the stage "I Love What I'm Doin'", but its basically just the same song by a different composer and used to show off the muscles of the athletes aboard ship. As a result, it is more campy than show-stopping. Musically for me, the highlight was "Bye Bye Baby", while Marilyn's "Diamonds" is more of a music video inserted into a movie. (Along with "Funny Face's" "Think Pink", I can't think of two musical numbers in movie musicals that qualify as moments in film that influenced the music video industry.) While this may never stand up as a faithful version of the stage show, it does its job quite satisfactorily and the results are mostly pleasing. Just give Jane a break, and view the film from Dorothy's perspective for once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lorelei and Dorothy are two singers that make a cruise from the U.S. to Paris. A blonde and a brunette, with her beauty and charm will appeal to the whole passage. Both have the same goal: to marry a millionaire. But there is a downside: Lorelei has a boyfriend, whose father hired a detective to follow herAfter the success of "Niagara" Marilyn's career soars like an arrow. Her next film "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" is the version of a popular novel by Anita Loos about the obsession of many girls to catch a rich husband. Directed by Howard Hawks, in musical comedy, the film had one of the most explosive sexual cocktail: the serious exuberance of Jane Russell in front of the candid and provocative blonde Marilyn Monroe (the spectacular battle of the curves), a right holder press of the time. In addition, frequent musical numbers allowed to display their powers Marilyn singer and dancer, to the extent that the suspicious Zanuck ("The Almighty of the Fox") thought he had doubled his voice. Henceforth, the Fox mogul would have to recognize that Marilyn was the strongest promise of the study. Not sure that would soon become the star of your payroll. At the end of 1953, appeared on the cover of the inaugural issue of Playboy, thus being the first girl of the month the magazine, with the famous photograph golden dreams, where he showed his measures 94-58-92. In the pagan pantheon of Hollywood, Marilyn was called "the goddess of love" as he called the magazine "Time" in one of his many covers where she appeared. Indeed, following the success of the film, Monroe's name is placed among the ten largest U.S. life celebrities and Marilyn was invited, along with Jane Russell, leaving any traces of their hands in wet cement of Chinese Theatre (ironically, Marilyn also suggest that registered the breasts and buttocks). The performance of Monroe received positive reviews and their interpretation of the musical number "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friends" (Diamonds are the best friends of the girls) became a classic musical, imitated by Madonna in her classic "Material Girl. "It likes to see this movie again and again so glad that is, the catchy songs and the beauty of its musical numbers, and the irony of the dialogue and many of the lyrics. It contains the mythical scene Marilyn singing "Diamonds are a girl's best friend", although some of the other musical numbers do not fall short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly didn't know that Howard Hawks directed this classic Hollywood musical, which only increases my estimation of his talents. And a classic it most certainly is with dazzling colour, stunning beauty, some great songs and some witty comedy too. Yes, the plot's lighter than a life-belt and there is something a little unsavoury about Marilyn Monroe's Lorelei Lee character's motivations and actions, but, hey! it's only a musical, to paraphrase Hitchcock, so I'll not be over-critical. Jane Russell is a great foil for Monroe, arch, occasionally critical but always loyal and the rest of the supporting cast in this floating farce all help to keep the story drifting along but there's no argument that this is Marilyn's movie. She looks positively radiant throughout, sings and moves great, especially in her big number, the first rendition of "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend" and when she explains her fascination for men with money the way that men prefer their women good-looking rather than plain, she almost makes her skulduggery seem understandable. I'm not sure exactly what the US Olympic diving team had to do with the plot other than to give the girls some beefcake to drape themselves around but certainly Jane Russell's big number in the pool with the guys looks pretty camp to modern eyes. But of course, that was then and this is now and like I said earlier, times and outlooks change with the times. In fact I'd excuse almost anything if latter-day Hollywood could find a star with the appeal of Monroe and a director with the flair of Hawks. That's what this gentleman would certainly prefer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can I say? I thoroughly enjoyed this. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes may be fluff, but my goodness, it is enjoyable fluff. The men may be underused, and the third act is rather flat and contrived. However, the whole film is superbly photographed, with some eye popping costumes. The music is wonderful too, Diamonds are a Girl's best friend is iconic and for a reason but every other song is well done too. The choreography is also sprightly and enjoyable, while the script is snappy and witty and the story well-structured. The pace rarely lags either, and Howard Hawk's direction is excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed the performances of the two leads. Jane Russell is a great match, but it is Marilyn Monroe's movie. Classy, beautiful and entrancing, she really gives it her all and gives a superb performance in the process. All in all, thoroughly enjoyable and worth watching for Monroe alone. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dorothy (Jane Russell) chaperones Lorelei (Marilyn Monroe) to Paris where they will be met by Lorelei's fiancée Gus (Tommy Noonan). However, a private detective, Ernie (Elliott Reid), is also hired to report on Lorelei's behaviour during the boat crossing. Lorelei loves her diamonds and her meeting with a wealthy diamond profiteer (Charles Coburn) on the boat is a recipe for disaster. How will any misunderstandings be resolved when Dorothy and Lorelei reach Paris? Will they find love....?....yeah, of course they will.It's a light comedy that keeps you watching and is actually quite good. Despite Marilyn Monroe's reputation as a dimwit, she plays on it well in this film and is central to many humorous sequences. In fact, the whole cast delivers a good performance with amusing lines coming from all angles. A special mention to George Winslow who plays Henry Spofford III (..Are you a burglar?..) and Charles Coburn who is always funny. Russell and Monroe sing some catchy songs and it's all delivered in glorious Technicolour. Great colour, a fun cast and an entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lorelei Lee (Marilyn Monroe), who may or may not actually be from Little Rock (though her opening duet with her pal Dorothy Shaw--Jane Russell--is retitled "Two Little Girls from Little Rock" for the movie adaptation of Anita Loo's Broadway play), apparently hasn't gotten around much, wherever she's from. When she hears diamond mogul "Piggy" Beekman's wife speak of a tiara at the head table on the ocean liner Isle de Paris, she pleads ignorance of this term, leading Lady Beekman (Norma Varden) to model said item. This is when an enthralled Lorelei enthuses "I just love finding new places to wear diamonds." (It is indeed tragic that Lorelei was so much before her time, as she could have a field day at a 21st Century piercing parlor.) Another telling clue as to how Lorelei's mind works comes when she discovers that Henry Spofford III (George Winslow) is a pre-teen, despite his name being coupled with a valet on the liner's passenger manifest. "If only he was 16 or 17, you could marry him in Tennessee," she laments to Dorothy. GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES provides wonderful insights into what movie-goers considered funny in the 1950's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not quite the cheesecake farce the ads made it out to be, this tuneful adaptation of the musical stage hit (via Anita Loos' book) is a very good comic vehicle for Marilyn Monroe, ostensibly playing a mercenary ditz--but with a brain after all. Pal Jane Russell gets most of the sarcastic lines, yet when it's Marilyn's turn to deliver a put-down, she does it dryly and delightfully. MM's rapport with Russell is carefully manufactured (they never step on each other's lines); still, they're a colorful showgirl team, cruising to Paris and tangling with a rich old coot and a private detective. Fox musical has costume changes galore (curiously with many of them in black), although the snappy witticisms can only take the picture so far. It runs out of steam in the final reel (right about the time Russell impersonates Monroe in court, an idea which falls flat). For most of the sojourn, a fast-paced frolic with funny retorts, enjoyable bits of nutty business, and Monroe singing "Diamond's Are a Girl's Best Friend". She may be a man-trap, but she's a savvy one. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell team up for "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," also starring Charles Coburn, Elliot Reid, Tommy Noonan, and George Winslow. Marilyn and Jane are Lorelei Lee and Dorothy, two showgirls and best friends en route to Paris. The gold-digging Lorelei intends to marry her rich, nerdy, beloved beau, Gus, but his father has a detective on board hoping to get something on her. Meanwhile, an older, wealthy man (Coburn) takes an interest in her while she takes an interest in his wife's tiara, and Dorothy starts to fall for the detective. The result is a delightful musical comedy.Jane and Marilyn are in top form, both traffic-stopping, sexy, stunning women and wonderful performers. Russell is leggy and earthy, with a good singing voice and nice line delivery as the more grounded Dorothy. Monroe is exquisite, really shining in the number later copied by Madonna for "Material Girl," "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend." All the numbers are energetic and great.This film really solidified Monroe's position at Twentieth Century Fox, and it's easy to see why. Though she wanted to do drama, for this viewer, her very careful enunciation limited her somewhat, though she is excellent in "Don't Bother to Knock" and "Niagara." Her characterization of Lorelei is marvelous - the dumb blonde who's not so dumb. "I can be smart when it's important," she says with a sly smile. No matter what the role, Monroe always had a sweetness about her - you could hear it in her voice and see it in her smile. It's a shame she was so insecure. During "Some Like it Hot," Billy Wilder noticed that she kept looking at Paula Strasberg for approval after every scene, and Strasberg would give her some sort of a sign. Wilder pretended not to notice until after one take, when he turned to Strasberg and yelled, "HOW ABOUT YOU, PAULA? WAS IT OKAY?" Poor Marilyn. She had it all. She just didn't know it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Novelty films are often the ones that attract me most. Here you have a novelty of two beautiful showgirls who seek male companionship, but each looking for different things. Loreli (Monroe) is interested in money, but only one man, Dorothy (Russell) is not interested in money, but essentially *any* man. Then when she falls for detective Reid, there is a wonderful conflict-of-interest between her romance versus loyalty to her best friend. That may be the greatest novelty of all: female bonding on screen. This is one of few movies ever made which shows women as friends instead of rivals or cunning back-stabbers-- a fantasy which could've only been invented in Hollywood. These ladies are like sisters; a female version of "Bosom Buddies-" pun intended!! Women tend to be more frank (and are definitely more honest) with each other then with men, but they are rarely as nasty as movies like to show them. These are the scenes I enjoy the most: Monroe trying to match Russell with a rich, eligible man for the Captain's dinner; Russell protecting Monroe from Reid's fortune-hunting accusations, while at the same time reminding Monroe that money isn't everything. And when they first strut into the ship's dining room in their evening gowns and furs- my God!!</fullReview>

A sheer delight and all those little moments that seem to give new audiences a few problems, some are even calling it misogynistic (!), make it all the more fun. I suppose in today's politically correct environment, this could be considered on the subversive side. But it is only a bit of fun, a 50s extravaganza built upon the perceived notion that men like a pretty girl and women like a rich guy. Have things changed? Clearly it's not as clear cut as that for everyone but because there is more than a kernel of truth is what helps make this a smile a minute, toe tapping and rip roaring success. Russell does well but Monroe works her socks off and doesn't put a foot wrong (sorry about the mixed metaphors!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sort of film one cannot help admiring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" is based around the inspired idea of taking one of Hollywood's best-known blonde sex symbols, Marilyn Monroe, and teaming her with one of Hollywood's best-known brunette sex symbols, Jane Russell, in a film about two girls who have not only contrasting looks but also contrasting characters. Marilyn plays Lorelei, named after the siren in German legend who lured men to their doom, and Jane plays the more prosaically named Dorothy. The two friends are showgirls working on a transatlantic liner crossing from New York to France.Lorelei is a quite unashamed gold-digger whose great ambition is to find herself a wealthy husband. She seems to have achieved this ambition because she is engaged to Gus Esmond, the son of a wealthy family, but this has aroused the opposition of Gus's father. The old man has engaged a private detective named Ernie Malone to follow Lorelei on her voyage and to try and find out anything that will discredit her. Lorelei seems to be doing her best to provide Malone with the necessary information because, even though she has a fiancé waiting for her back in the States, she cannot help flirting with the South African diamond tycoon Sir Francis "Piggy" Beekman. (Piggy, it should be noted, is not only married but also old enough to be Lorelei's father, if not grandfather).In order to get close to Lorelei, Malone starts chatting up her friend Dorothy, and (inevitably) the two start falling for one another. Dorothy, despite a string of cynical wisecracks, is more idealistic than Lorelei, and disdains the idea of marrying for money. There is, however, a limit to Dorothy's idealism- although she says she will only marry for love, she tends to judge men by their looks, and spends a lot of time on the ship flirting with the handsome members of the American athletics squad on their way to the Olympic Games. (In real life, any American athletics team of this period would have included a number of black members, but all the athletes we see in the film are white).Lorelei's character is not one that bears too close examination. She is both shamelessly flirtatious and shamelessly mercenary- she nearly gets put into prison when she refuses to hand back a valuable diamond tiara which was given to her by Sir Francis and which Lady Beekman believes her to have stolen. To make such a character likable rather than detestable was quite a challenge, but Marilyn Monroe managed to pull it off. She is sometimes regarded as a lightweight actress, but "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" gave her a chance to show off her acting talents, as well as her singing and dancing ones. (There are several musical numbers, and Marilyn performs the well-known "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend" which became the unofficial anthem of the diamond industry, at least until Shirley Bassey released "Diamonds are Forever"). Marilyn's undoubted sexiness was softened by a sort of girlish innocence, and she puts that quality to good use here. Lorelei may be a bad girl, but she is the sort of bad girl one would find it easy to forgive.Jane Russell was, if anything, even sexier than Monroe- she certainly had a better figure, evident when we see the two together in their skimpy showgirl costumes. Her sexiness was, however, of the more straightforward type- there was little that was girlish or innocent about her- so it was perhaps appropriate that she was cast as the "good girl" Dorothy. Had the roles been reversed, Russell might have made Lorelei seem too hard and brassy.Both actresses, incidentally, followed up this film by making films that have something in common with it. Jane Russell's next film, "The French Line", was another musical romantic comedy mostly set on a transatlantic liner between America and France. Monroe's next film was "How to Marry a Milionaire", a title that could equally well have suited "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes". Apart from Charles Coburn's Piggy, an amusing caricature of the ageing roué, the male characters are largely uninteresting; Gus and Malone are little more than ciphers. There is nothing deep or significant about this film- it is a typical light-hearted Hollywood musical of the period. It is so skilfully done, however, and the two female leads so appealing, that it is the sort of film one cannot help admiring. 7/10</fullReview>

This is a classic, wonderful movie and shows and displays the lovely Marilyn Monroe. It is as timely today as it was years ago.

		<fullReview>Total delight with Marilyn Monroe playing her patented "dumb blonde" to perfection and Jane Russell in one of her best comic performances.The two stars plays entertainers on the hunt for men. Monroe is a diamond fiend and Russell just wants love. Classic story filmed many times, this is the film version of the Broadway musical that starred Carol Channing.Great songs including "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" starring Monroe in hot pink gown set against a bright Technicolor background. Russell reprises the song in a courtroom and is hilarious. The girls sing "We're Just Two Little Girls from Little Rock" and "When Love Goes Wrong" and Russell sings the terrific "Ain't There Anyone Here for Love" with the Olympic team as chorus boys. The girls also sing "Bye Bye, Baby." This movie is bright and splashy and fast-paced and a lot of fun. It's just amazing how good Monroe is at the blonde mantrap. Both stars had no dancing ability, but the choreography allows them to move and gesture so that it appears they can dance. Russell is wonderful as the wise-cracking Dorothy. Both are knock-outs in the opening number in their matching ruby red glimmer gowns.Charles Coburn is funny as Lord Beakman, Norma Varden is Lady Beakman, Elliot Reid the private eye, Tommy Noonan the dopey bf, Taylor Holmes is his father, Marcel Dalio is the judge, and George Winslow the kid. Alvy Moore (Mr. Kimball from Green Acres) is one of the athletes! and George Chakiris (Oscar winner from West Side Story) is one of the dancers in the "Diamonds Area a Girl's Best Friend" number.There's a major goof during Russell's big number. One of the athletes totally misses his move while she's strutting by and swinging tennis rackets.Great fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful fluff like they don't make anymore. MONROE and RUSSELL are captivating as two showgirls (one looking for riches, the other looking for love) venture on a cruise. They meet up with all kinds of adventures and characters. The almost plot less story is fun and not to be taken too seriously. Wish there were more scenes aboard the ship. Looks like scenes were left on the cutting room floor and the mid section seems a bit disjointed. A known production number with MONROE and RUSSELL was cut, as a bit can be seen in the trailer. Tis a pity. MONROE is at her prime here and I can't think of anyone else in that era, or in this era actually, who could play Loreli Lee. RUSSELL is no less outstanding as the "sidekick" This is a real female "buddy" movie and I just wish the DVD would have had the deleted scenes and a commentate from Miss Russell or Mr Reed (the only surviving members to date) would have been great. The only weak note is how and when the tiara was stolen and why didn't Marilyn discover it immediately as she must have looked at it daily as this is the one item she wanted almost throughout the film. Anyway, aside from that, the film is a must see for nostalgics and fans of that type of entertainment...Fox had the gaudiest, most colorful musicals of them all. MONROE delights in every scene she's in, but especially the cocktail party scene when she's discovered where a diamond tiara is actually worn, and the "stuck in the porthole" scene has got to be seen to be believed. Of course, the DIAMONDS ARE A GIRLS BEST FRIEND number is magnificent and can be viewed over and over again. As famous as Marilyns skirt blowing scene in SEVEN YEAR ITCH. What a national treasure MONROE was. No wonder she's an icon today. And what a fabulous actress. For having such a jubilant life, you'd never know it by her screen performances. Now THAT'S an actress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best silly movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean that in all sincerity. On the surface, this film seems very simplistic. Two showgals from Arkansas try to make it big and find the love of their lives, but there is so much more going on beneath the surface. I haven't seen a lot of Marilyn's films, aside from the likes of "Some Like It Hot," but here she gives a great performance as a sexy starlett who happens to be a golddigger, but is still quite smart in terms of knowing what she wants and getting it! We sympathize with her character every step of the way, and cheer for her in the end. Similarly, Monroe is well-balanced by Jane Russell. I was delighted to find out through the IMDB that she is still alive! I thought she had passed away a few years back (sorry, Jane- if you see this!). She is as gorgeous and sexy as Monroe and really carries the film well. Of course, everyone has seen Madonna's "Material Girl" video which is a direct rip-off of a number in this film, but nothing matches the original! Hawks' top-notch direction are once again in form. This movie could have easily been another silly musical, but Hawks made sure the movie carried itself even no one was singing and dancing. There are a number of hokey scenes in the film however, include Jane Russell dancing around an Olympic men's swim team, but in the end the movie is quite remarkable and it is better than many more famous musical films, like "My Fair Lady" and "Hello Dolly!" This movie is also proof that a straight man like me can enjoy musicals! There is also a great article about this film in Danny Peary's "Cult Movies 3" which is out of print, but available on Amazon (I think!). Check it out. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You won't be able to take your eyes off of Marilyn Monroe in this comic gem! This is a must see classic and a true crowd pleaser every time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**************SOME SPOILERS AHEAD!!!********************************** In my humble opinion, "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" may be the best musical comedy ever made. Howard Hawks' comic masterpiece stars Marilyn Monroe as Lorelei Lee and Jane Russell as Dorothy, her sassy sarcastic friend. This movie receives generally good reviews from critics and yet does not receive the recognition it deserves as a comic masterpiece. Marilyn Monroe does not miss a beat as the lounge singer whose maxim is "diamonds are a girls best friend!" Lorelei and Dorothy set sail for 'Europe France' as Lorelei says while boarding the ocean liner. Lorelei is playing hard to get and hopes her lover (hilariously played by Tommy Noonan) will follow her to Europe where she can get him away from his disapproving father long enough to marry her. Dorothy is to serve as chaperone on the trip, but it soon becomes obvious that the chaperone has her eyes on the entire U.S. men's Olympic team! Meanwhile Lorelei carefully studies the ships passenger list in order to find all of the worthwhile male passengers who have a valet in order to have them seated at her and Dorothy's table each evening for dinner. Is Lorelei in for a surprise when Henry Spofford III, the most eligible bachelor aboard and the dinner partner she handpicked for the entire cruise turns out to be only 10 years old! The look of shock on her face is priceless when he sits down beside her and introduces himself. Fortunately for Lorelei, she bumps into a 'worthwhile' older gentleman, Howard Beekman (played by the deliriously funny Charles Coburn), who owns a diamond mine. "Piggy", as Mr. Beekman is nicknamed, is more than delighted with Lorelei's attentions and she in turn is fascinated with his diamonds and especially one diamond tiara in particular. Norma Varden plays Lady Beekman to the hilt as the jealous wife who wears so much diamond jewelry that Lorelei exclaims that she looks like a diamond mine herself! Needless to say, Lady Beekman is not pleased when Piggy gives Lorelei the diamond tiara and she claims that Lorelei stole the tiara and intends to have her arrested. To top it all off, Dorothy's amorous new friend (a pitch perfect performance by Elliott Reid) turns out to be a private investigator hired by Lorelei's wealthy boyfriends father, Mr. Esmond, to spy on Lorelei and prove her to be an unfaithful golddigger. The comic situations keep rolling along in waves of hilarity as the ship sales across the ocean and the girls disembark to go shopping in France. Dorothy and Lorelei cook up a scheme where Dorothy impersonates Lorelei to get Lorelei out of hot water. You'll enjoy seeing the girls dance, sing and use their considerable charms to mastermind their way out of the jam they are in when they end up broke in Paris with Lady Beekman and the French police on their trail.This fifty year old film is as ageless as the diamonds that make Lorelei's eyes light up each time she sees them. I laugh harder and longer with each viewing. Howard Hawks gets simply amazing performances from all of his actors. Marilyn Monroe looks as if she would glow in the dark and she was never more beautiful and charming than she was in this film. Marilyn doesn't just portray Lorelei Lee in this movie, she becomes Lorelei Lee to the degree that you forget she is Marilyn the star. Marilyn as Lorelei has so much charm and magnetism that you simply can not take your eyes off of her in any frame she is in, and it works to the story's advantage in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." Jane Russell is also perfectly cast as Dorothy, Lorelei's loyal friend. You won't find better on screen chemistry anywhere between two stars than you find between Marilyn and Jane. This movie works as a comedy, as a musical and even as a buddy film. There are only two scenes in the entire movie that were not quite up to snuff, and they are still good scenes. Jane Russell seems a little awkward in one scene where her character Dorothy pretends to be Marilyn's character, Lorelei. The only other slight stumble the film made is that the scene where Dorothy watches the men's Olympic team exercise while she sings "Is there anyone here for love" is just a bit too long and spends too much time focusing on the nearly naked physiques of the men's Olympic team causing the film to lose its focus on the comedy for a minute or two.I have to mention also that the songs in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" are delightful and full of the wittiest lyrics I've heard in a long time. "Bye Bye Baby", "Little Rock" and "When Love Goes Wrong, Nothing Goes Right" are my three favorites that I find myself humming long after the movie is over. The songs blend seamlessly into the movie with kudos no doubt going to the director and film editor. The choreography is great fun to watch, although Marilyn and Jane are not Broadway caliber dancers by any means. What they lack in professional dancing skills, they make up for in sexiness, enthusiasm and pure class. I give this movie a 95/100. The only other movie I can think of which has made me laugh so much is "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." Neither of them are high brow artsy movies, but both of these are real audience pleasers that I've yet to see anyone go away from without a smile on their face. "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" is a don't miss movie which is every bit as funny as Billy Wilder's classic "Some Like it Hot" starring Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe.!</fullReview>

Furthermore, although the two female leads are seemingly everything the feminist movement abhors, the irony is that they are pretty darn wily, intelligent women (one more intelligent than the other perhaps) who know how to get what they want.This is, of course, classic Monroe, and Russell is also wonderful. (She does a hysterical impression of her co-star.) Monroe does a good job with "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend," although in my opinion Carol Channing sang it better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Animal Magnetism. Marilyn's Multi-Layered Sex Appeal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," a light-headed comedy at first glance, is probably the most powerful, archaic, bacchanalian homage to Marilyn Monroe's raw sex appeal ever made. Legendary director Howard Hawks has costumes, make-up, and music converge to underscore Marilyn monumental self-representation as the Holy Trinity of Sex, as Artemis, Aphrodite, and the Magna Mater. My interpretation may seem labored a first, but I do believe that beneath a surface of harmless jokes and half-prudish innuendo, there is an abyss of sexual archetypes evoked by Marilyn Monroe in an enormously suggestive performance.The plot of "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" is roughly that Lorelei Lee (MM), a blonde showgirl with a hot body and an empty head, wishes to lure the rich, inexperienced bachelor Gus Esmond (Tommy Noonan) into marrying her. Since Gus's father opposes the marriage, they plan on getting married in France. Gus sends Lorelei, accompanied by fellow showgirl Dorothy Shaw (Jane Russell), ahead by ship, warning her not to produce any scandal. On the trip, Lorelei meets the senile, but lustful millionaire Sir Francis Beekman, whom she talks into giving her the diamond tiara of his wife. Lord Beekman, however, reports the tiara as stolen, so that Lorelei has to face the police upon her arrival in Paris. In a sub-plot Dorothy falls in love with Ernie Malone (Elliott Reid), a private detective hired by Gus's father to spy on Lorelei. After some twists and turns, both couples join their hands in matrimony in a final wedding scene.There are moments in which Marilyn is a pagan Virgin divine, a goddess with the white knees, Artemis. These are the kittenish moments and the pensive ones, e.g. when she enters her cabin with Noonan and naively exclaims: "Look! Round Windows!" as she points to the portholes. You may say she's just playing dumb, which is true to a certain extent, but there really is an original sense of authentic innocence about her in that moment. The same is true of the scene in which Lorelei, immediately after being the performing the materialistic, yet grand musical number "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend," in a contemplative moods explains to Dorothy that she really does love Gus.There is, however, the second layer of archetypical allusion in those scenes in which Lorelei appears as the temptress, a goddess of venal sexuality, an Aphrodite. Needless to say that the aforesaid song, which explicitly encourages women to ask for monetary remuneration in return for sexual favors, belongs in this group. Generally all scenes suggesting the exchange sex for money are part and parcel of this layer of meaning, like the scene in which Marilyn tries on the infamous diamond tiara, exclaiming in her seductive voice: "I just love finding new places to wear diamonds!" One might also think of the initial song "Two Little Girls From Little Rock" and the subsequent scene in the showgirls' dressing room, in which Lorelei relishes in the gift of a diamond engagement ring.The most powerful, and in a sense most dignified, group of mythic allusions is that which make Marilyn a lager-than-life mother figure oscillating between allure and authority. There are a number of scenes in which the male figures are reduced to mere boys in her presence. This is the case with Gus all along, who appears no more than a pale appendix to the luminous presence of Lorelei in virtually all scenes in which Noonan and Monroe's characters are on screen together. The delightful scene in which Marilyn is stuck in a porthole states the idea explicitly: Mr. Henry Spofford III, a mere boy, sees her and assumes that she is a burglar, but explains that he is going to held her for two reasons: "The first reason is that I'm to young to be sent into jail. And the second reason is, you've got a lot of animal magnetism." Is there any scene in any MM-movie that more clearly words the deep, dark, desperate devotional desire Marilyn's persona incited and continues to incite in the male psyche? I don't think she herself was fully aware of the power that came with her unique, radiant femininity. Just watch the musical number "When Love Goes Wrong," in which two young boys dance before Marilyn as she sings of love: The seductive glance she casts at one of the boys seems to galvanize him, like a premature awakening, a coming-of-age initiated by a mere look.Jane Russell is a fabulous costar, and a costar who was a lot better payed than Marilyn, sad as it is to say that. In the musical duets, Russell also proves that she had a better singing voice than Marilyn. But nonetheless the movie is really built around Marilyn and her multi-layered, powerful sexual aura. From costumes (the unforgettable pink dress) through music ("Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend") to memorable quotes ("I just love finding new places to wear diamonds") it's Lorelei whose image remains engraved most lastingly in the mind of anybody who has ever seen "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." The movie has made Marilyn into the true Lorelei of the German folk legend, a mythical woman, unreachable, yet desirable, who comprises all the mentioned layers of femininity, a holy virgin, a lustful hetaera, and a mother goddess at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly polished fluff...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throw realism out the window--otherwise, this film probably won't work. That's because if you really think about it, the character that Marilyn Monroe plays is pretty despicable. But, playing it for comedy manages to make her a bit easier to take. Monroe plays a money-grubber whose only interest is finding a rich man to buy her things. Her shallowness is astounding! Conversely, her best friend (Jane Russell) is man-crazy but could care less if a man has money. In real life, such divergent personalities could never be such close friends, as their values are diametrically opposed. But, given some nice comedy writing and music, it is easier to take.The film begins with Monroe and her current boyfriend (Tommy Noonan) becoming engaged. He's a rich but rather wimpy young man whose family would never approve of a showgirl like Monroe's character. Despite this, he promises to marry her in Europe. But, when she is ready to travel on the Isle de France, he's a no-show so she decides to look for other game--in other words, another rich guy. Her quarry on the cruise is a rich old goat (Charles Coburn) and it doesn't bother her that he's already married! Nice girl, huh?! On the cruise, Russell meets a nice guy who claims to be rich as well--a definite turnoff for her. However, in reality he's a private detective who was sent to get proof of the sort of woman Monroe is, as Noonan's family is desperate to keep their son from making a big mistake.While the film seems to try to get you feel sorry for the girls, if you think about it, Monroe is a despicable whore--and makes little pretense about this! She's a self-involved money-hungry "lady" with no real depth to her. When caught, she claims that SHE is the victim! Some who watch the film can just laugh at her character but I know I struggled to keep watching, as I hated everything about her. Also, why, oh why, would a nice lady like Russell have anything to do with such a selfish conniver?! The bottom line is that there is some nice comedy (particularly the cute scenes with child actor George Winslow) and some amazingly iconic musical numbers (such as "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"). But, aside from this, the story just seems pretty shallow and dumb. It is a bit easier to take since Monroe seems hard to take seriously, but still she is a horrible person...and not always that funny.This film has many fans and perhaps they are more able to laugh off the plot as fluff or just focus on how incredibly beautiful Miss Monroe is in the film. As for me, the film just promotes the "blondes are idiots" myth and seems to paint some women as glorified prostitutes--and because of that, while it looks great, it misses the mark.Fluff...unadulterated fluff. And this is made all too apparent in the dopey courtroom scene near the end...uggh! You just have to see it to believe it...it's THAT bad. Up until the ending, I might have given the film a 6 or 7--it was annoying but well made. However, given the courtroom antics of Jane Russell and how ridiculous the whole thing is, I am begin charitable in giving the film a 5.</fullReview>

Do men make passes at girls who wear glasses? Yes. Do gentlemen prefer blondes? Sometimes. If the dog is man's best friend, what is women's?Marilyn might not have been a great dancer, but she could move. She might not have been a great singer, but her voice was smooth as cocoa butter and memorable. Everyone remembers her cooing "Happy Birthday" to JFK. And her role as Lorelei Lee in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" is iconic (just ask Madonna), especially in the number "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend".She strutted and wiggled her way through that movie with Jane Russell as fellow chorine, Dorothy Shaw--a non-blonde. With her usual heart- of-gold portrayal, Marilyn proved that it was not only okay to dig for gold, it was logical. Besides, she might actually have loved the hapless schmuck she set her sights on.Taking full advantage of Technicolor, director Howard Hawks created a vibrant film that revels in the innocent lustiness of a Marilyn (her next film would be "How to Marry a Millionaire") and a Jane (who two years later would star in "Gentlemen Marry Brunettes"). Though the early fifties signaled a newfound sexual freedom, clearly the emphasis was still on marriage, whether the female lead was Doris Day or Marilyn Monroe.This is a lightweight film, admittedly, and it offers little in the way of heart-pounding romance, suspense or drama. Just two beautiful women on a casual mission to find a few carats if happiness.</fullReview>

Her magnetism is undeniable. Her bubbly personality outshines even Jane Russell.There are some fun jokes mostly sexual in nature as expected. The songs are good including the iconic "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend". That particular song production is especially fun. It makes the movie.

		<fullReview>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is an adaptation of the 1949 stage musical that stars Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell, with Charles Coburn, Elliott Reid, Tommy Noonan, Taylor Holmes, and Norma Varden in supporting roles. The screenplay by Charles Lederer is augmented by the music of songwriting teams Hoagy Carmichael &amp; Harold Adamson and Jule Styne &amp; Leo Robin. The songs by Styne and Robin are from the Broadway show, while the songs by Carmichael and Adamson were written especially for the film.It was directed by Howard Hawks.Miss Lorelei Lee has a philosophy that "Diamonds are a girl's best friend." Together with her best human friend Dorothy, she embarks upon a boat trip to Paris, where she intends to marry millionaire Gus Esmond. En route, the girls are bedeviled by private detective Malone, hired by Esmond's father to make certain that Lorelei isn't just another gold- digger. When Dorothy falls in love with the poverty-stricken Malone, Lorelei decides to find her pal a wealthier potential husband, and that's how she gets mixed up with flirtatious diamond merchant Sir Francis Beekman and precocious youngster Henry Spofford III.Howard Hawks' joyous musical comedy of 1953 is the film that catapulted Marilyn Monroe to major stardom and iconic status as sex symbol.Also,both leads - Jane Russell and Monroe - has sparkling magnetism that makes it a delightfully entertaining 1950's musical that can still be enjoyed at present.It is charged by Hawks's stylish snap, a famous set piece or two, Russell's wit, and songs by Leo Robin and Jule Styne. It may largely be a fluff project best remembered as a showcase for its leading actresses, but then the leads rarely got such extended opportunities to prove that they were more than cinematic icons but just sex symbols.Overall,it's a wild and joyously funny ride across the Atlantic as our bathing beauties plan and plot a way to land their men.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it a cleverly subversive iconography on the part of the film or merely catty, how it posits sultry womanhood to be the dominant sex whose main power however is derived by maintaining a firm grip, a diamond grip, on male libido? At least, one of them is portrayed as blatantly vacuous, riffing on our own image of a drowsy Marilyn; but she surprises at key points with a matter-of-fact pragmatism, that was hers as much as the sexual allure. We know that she got married at 16 to avoid being sent back to the orphanage. This was her breakthrough, a new face next to superstar Russell; history has noted that we preferred the blonde.The other is presumably out for true love untainted by material wealth, though her primary allegiance is always to her girlfriend. Having subdued their partners to a kind of sheepish position, they are framed in the end as though marrying each other, at least this part can't be scoffed as accident.So perhaps both subversive and catty in the long run, since it operates with the kind of dreamy logic that is at the heart of the musical, the stageshow dazzle always mapping inwards as well as out. We need to acquiesce to be seduced with the men around the two women, if this is to work at all. We need to feel that the battle of the sexes was over before it started.And of course, the famous number acting out how 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend'. The chorus of men eagerly offer their hearts to Marilyn, the offer met with indifferent rejection. They kill themselves. Another male chorus was eagerly performing tricks to impress Jane Russell, who glided among them like an owner supervising his trade.It is fluff, sexually feverish fluff about female empowerment solely invested by the male gaze. The girls win because the guys concede to lose. Outside the wistful fantasy about sex, it is an average comedy of errors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monroe and Russell Shine in this Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES is the sparkling 1953 musical comedy based on the Broadway musical that made Carol Channing a star and here does the same thing for another blonde...namely Marilyn Monroe. Monroe shines in the ultimate dumb blonde role: Lorelei Lee, who along with best pal Dorothy Shaw (Jane Russell) are a couple of showgirls being tailed by a private detective hired by the father of Lorelai's latest beau, to get the goods on her.The razor-thin plot is so not the issue here. The issue is the performances by the film's stars that absolutely light up the screen. Monroe, in particular, found the role of a lifetime here as Lorelei Lee, the seemingly dim-witted gold digger with a nose for diamonds and rich men, who has no shame about using her obvious physical assets to get what she wants. This is the role that most people look to when they say that Monroe was just a "dumb blonde", but if you watch closely, Monroe is just playing a "dumb blonde" and doing it better than probably anyone ever did. And never was there a clearer example of why the camera just loved Monroe.Though the film is clearly Monroe's showcase, Jane Russell never allows herself to be blown off the screen and performs impressively alongside Monroe as the wisecracking Dorothy Shaw. Russell proves to have the same skill with a wisecrack that actresses like Thelma Ritter and Eve Arden did.Elliott Reed, Tommy Noonan, Charles Coburn, and young George Winslow offer solid support in supporting roles as the various men (and boys) involved in the misadventures of Lorelei and Dorothy.Musical highlights include the ladies' opening number, "Two Little Girls from Little Rock", "Bye Bye Baby", "Ain't Anybody Here for Love?", and Monroe's iconic "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend", a number that has become a permanent part of cinema pop culture.Aided by breezy direction from Howard Hawks, this is a delightful musical comedy classic which features two beautiful and talented ladies front and center at the peak of their charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A girl's best friend"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This very premise of this musical comedy seems like a joke in itself. Here we have Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell, two actresses whose stardom was founded upon their physical assets rather than their actual talent, cast side by side in one movie. It's as good as announcing that this is first and foremost a picture about sex appeal. But it's not all about exploiting the allure of these two women. One of the big jokes of Anita Loos's story is the fact that Lorelei and Dorothy view themselves view men in as just a cynical manner as many men viewed them. And really the picture is just as much about eyeing up men as it as eyeing up women.And Monroe and Russell weren't quite the untalented bimbos their studio promoters thought of them as. Russell can act after a fashion, with a smooth performance that is true to her single-minded character. Although Russell got top-billing and was paid far more, she clearly knew the principal character was Monroe's, and she acknowledges this by never trying to upstage her co-star. Monroe on the other hand works feverishly at promoting her persona. Admittedly she has very little range, but within that range she does considerable things, taking up every conceivable angle to show off her allure. Neither of these women were going to win any awards for their work here, but the point is they both absolutely fit the bill for their characters, and not just in the physical department.For some reason, the production was handed to director Howard Hawks, probably for his noted adeptness with comedy. Hawks keeps things simple, allowing the cast long takes for the funnier routines to play out, but he seems ill-at-ease with the musical format, with no sense of flow or exaggeration. There's some great choreography though by an uncredited Jack Cole, the finest example of which is probably the turning of athletic training into dance for the "Ain't there anyone here for Love?" number. Incidentally there is a rather glaring goof in that routine, as when Russell walks between the two lines of men doing knee-stretches, one of the guys on the left towards the back totally fluffs the move. A chorus girl would never have got away with that, but I guess none of the male production crew would admit they were paying attention to all those men's bottoms! Perhaps the most notable thing about Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is that it introduces (to the cinema at least) several classic songs that have since become very familiar. The liveliness and audacity of Jules Styne/Leo Robin numbers "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend" and "Bye Bye Baby" are perfect the picture. However the best tune for my money is Hoagy Carmichael's wonderfully bluesy "When Love Goes Wrong, Nothing Goes Right". And although the picture may take the form of an integrated musical (one of the "bursting into song" kinds), the ostentatious splash of the songs seems somewhat at odds with what is really a rather self-contained comedy. I'm reminded a lot of the 30s non-integrated musicals in which the numbers were speciality pieces for which the story took a break. It seems that, with all the fuss over the two leads, the picture lost the co-ordinated approach needed for a classic musical. Still, whether one is after ear-candy, eye-candy or simply a few good gags, there are lots of little treats here, putting Gentlemen Prefer Blondes squarely in the category of good fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This hilarious musical comedy with excellent production values, glorious Technicolor and terrific dialog is well matched by the effervescent casting and ideal characters. Deliciously 50s in style and risqué antics, with Jane Russell's outrageous gym song/dance number and Marilyn's unforgettable DIAMONDS' number GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES must have been one of the most profitable and well attended films of the decade (and beyond) worldwide. In a year that added THE BANDWAGON and CINEMASCOPE and HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE, cinemas must have rocked with delight and surprise at this clever level of new Hollywood. So successful was GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES that it was remade at RKO as THE FRENCH LINE and again by UA in 1955 as GENTLEMEN MARRY BRUNETTES each time incredibly with Jane Russell. Each film is basically the same: two showgirls get on an ocean liner and go to France. BLONDES does have ridiculous storyline especially with Russell's incredulous 'falling in love' with her antagonist, but overall the delicious hilarity of Monroe, the gasp-worthy costumes, and child actor George Winslow (and the hand kissing scene) makes GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES a DVD classic to treasure. The quality of the print as seen on my DVD player is astounding, making the whole fruit salad more appetizing. Teens today would love it and like SINGIN IN THE RAIN it should be a family movie night staple.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the stunning opening number with the dazzling dresses in sparkling red (eat your heart out Dorothy with your ruby red shoes!) the film is absolutely wonderful. Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russel are the showgirls and best friends who arrive in Paris for Lorelei's (Monroe) wedding. Of course Lorelei likes diamonds and everything goes wrong.This is true entertainment that is impossible to fault. The two female leads are sublime, oozing sexuality and confidence, but especially in Monroe's case, perfect comic timing. There are some hilarious moments in this: when Lorelei gets stuck in the porthole and then pretends to be enjoying the view-with the help Henry Spofford or there is the scene where the girls get Ernie drunk and pour water over his trousers is just brilliant. Another fine scene is where Dorothy pretends to be Lorelei in court. In fact I laughed so much during this and when I wasn't laughing I was smiling.The film looks great in it's glorious technicolour which is even more vivid in the array of costumes and make up: the outfits the girls sport are so stunning it becomes a shame there aren't more costume changes. Diamonds of course abound given more spectacle to the costumes. But there's more to this than costumes and firstly that's the two leads. Jane Russel and Marilyn Monroe are so perfect in these roles and Monroe really is Monroe in this. Everything she is loved for is here, her wonderful facial expressions with her subtle widening of her eyes or pouting of her lips make watching her mesmerizing. Despite her characters 'blondness' she is very clever and that we get to see that and that she isn't dumb blond makes her more likable. Secondly there is the fact that for a film in 1953, the film really does have women firmly in the lead, in a strong and confident manner and one that, as I said, oozes sexuality and more importantly from the women. Dorothy flirts with the entire Olympic team and later sings and dances with them as they train only in tan coloured briefs. Every time Lorelei enters a room she turns heads and when she kisses her fiancé he vagues out. But with all this the women are completely in control of actions and not only are aware of the reactions to them, but also how to control it. Empowerment? Of course.This is a screwball comedy of course and so any notion of women's empowerment is very underlying and perhaps back in 1953 it would have gone more or less unnoticed. But at the end of it, this is about entertainment and if this film doesn't entertain you, make you laugh and make you leave you with a smile on your face with it's deliciousness then you probably not go and see films.More of my review at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything about this film is iconic. Technicolor, Marilyn Monroe, costuming, soundtrack, screenplay.. All of it! Have you ever seen dresses so tight on any other actress? When the film premiered critics found it to be somewhat vulgar and shameful.! It was a huge hit regardless. The expensive musical numbers and costumes are magnificently produced and staged. Every angle of filming complements its cast to the fullest. I have to say Miss Russell matches Miss Monroe bit for bit in the allure dept. Her Dorothy is every bit as sexy and funny as Monroe's Lorelei. As stated in past biographies, it is obvious they got along very well during its rigorous filming. The same cant be said for its director Howard Hawks. In his words he wanted to replace Marilyn,rewrite the script, make it shorter,and get a new director. He had zero tolerance for sensitive, insecure actresses's such as M.M.The script is hilarious and way ahead of its time. In viewing the film now there are segments of dialog that must have been shocking for 1953. The rest of the cast is perfection. Charles Coburn providing vast amounts comedic ability in his role as Lorelei"s married suitor. I wish they could locate the "LOST" footage of the 3 musical numbers that were cut from the film by studio head Darryl Zanuck. It would give us the fans such pleasure to have them put back into the film. The sets that were constructed are fantastic. Hard to believe all of the scenes were done on sound stages. I also believe its safe to say that Betty Grable as Lorelei, would have been a huge mistake as 20th Century Fox's first choice for that role. It was tailor made and owned my Marilyn. This in my opinion, is her most enduring screen performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gentleman Prefer Blondes", 1953, is where the style and technique of Marilyn Monroe matched very well to a film character, for the first time and got noticed. Featuring the famous and glamorous musical number: "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend", this is the film that made Marilyn Monroe a star.Directed by the legendary Howard Hawks, which I consider one of Hollywood's best directors of the time, the story unfortunately relies on some standard and uninspired comedy writing.Marilyn plays a gold digging showgirl, who accompanies her showgirl friend (played by the legendary Jane Russell) on a luxury cruise liner destined for France. En route, they encounter a determined private investigator, the US Men's Olympic team and an elderly millionaire who happens to own a diamond mine. The highlight of the film is definitely Marilyn Monroe, as she shows for the first time, how she could blend sexiness, humor and glamor into a bankable character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare Howard Hawks take on the musical genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard Hawks was one of those directors who mostly directed classy drama's and screwball comedies, of which some are being regarded as classics these days. Seems odd for a director like that to venture into the bright, cheerful world of the musical movies but above all things "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" remains foremost a comedy that gets accompanied by some songs.It honestly is not among the best genre movies I have ever seen but it is all good and fun enough. What I like most is that it seems that the male and female roles get reversed in this movie. This time it are the girls who are after the men. Its two main leads are female, so the movie gets entirely done from their viewpoint.I was also surprised by the movie its prominently present sexual themes. For an 1953 this movie is being quite the sensual one. There is lots of sexual innuendo and at points in the movie the men get treated like sexual objects, as opposed to the female characters.It was one of the first big movie roles for Marilyn Monroe, who of course brings a lot of sensuality to the movie. And yes, she perhaps wasn't the best actress that ever lived but she surely always knew how to handle comedy. She is a perfect 'stupid' blonde and in her singing sequences she also does a great job, though I can also understand why it was considered to dub her voice through this movie. She had a special sound that you need to get accustomed to at first but once you do you'll simply just love it.The movie is nothing too special really but it also does very little wrong. Therefore this is a good and certainly watchable movie, that should entertain you throughout.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is a throwback to a simpler time when the world was calmer, life was simpler and people went to the movies simply for the enjoyment of it all. From the ribald opening number, "(We're just) Two Little Girls from Little Rock" to the ultimate tour de force performance of Miss Monroe in a sheer pink creation belting out her trademark "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend", we as a film audience are in for a major treat. Although this film was touted as a musical, it really isn't, with only five musical numbers to speak of.Even though this is Marilyn Monroe's "signature" film, Jane Russell upstages her in almost every scene that they're in together. The cameraderie between the two women was evident in almost every scene that they appeared in. Also, this film seems to follow a precedent for a lot of films from the mid to late 1950's that were set on transatlantic ocean liner voyages, the other notable one being 1957's An Affair to Remember. Frankly, that is one of the reasons that this film is such fun to begin with.For an enjoyable, lighthearted, carefree romp, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is surely hard to beat.My rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MY RATING- 7.6GENTLEMAN PREFER BLONDES is the mov that contains the immortal scene of Marylin singing `Diamonds are the Girls Best Friends'.It's much more than that, it's a light romantic comedy with Marylin and Jane Russel finding their ideal and millionaire husbands. Most of the action occurs in a cruise in the Atlantic also with old Charles Coburn delivering good moments with both girls. If we compare this one to SEVEN YEAR ITCH or BUS STOP we see that they're obviously superior, yet somehow this one became famous probably to the color of Marylin's hair. In fact I conly count one or two really funny sequences, while other Marylin's movs have non-stop gags. Yet watch it, if you want to enjoy beautiful Marylin and Jane and some nice mov!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining But Lacking A Real Plot...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie for its comic and musical qualities but overall there isn't really a firm plot that one can get engrossed with. It revolves around two small town country girls as we are made aware of in the first few minutes of the movie by a musical number with flashy red costumes. Lorelie, (Monroe) is engaged to the son of a rich business tycoon, who is suspicious of every move she makes. When she and her friend (Jane Russel) get on board an expensive boat cruise to meet Lorelie's fiancee in Paris, mischief follows and the trouble begins. With a sad obsession for diamonds (and just about all things sparkly) Lorelie cozies up to an elderly British guy, who JUST SO HAPPENS to have access to a very expensive, diamond tiara. Trouble ensues and of course, the clever Jane Russel, gets them out of it. Flashy costumes and dance numbers seem to be more important though and the plot is sometimes put on the back burner. Monroe sings her famous "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend". My Score: 7</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a feast for the eyes and ears. The lavishness of the 50's comes thru beautifully in this film. The music, the sets, the clothes and of course Marilyn and Jane. They are truly divine as best buddies when most films portray women as back-stabbing cats. There is true friendship going on between Loreli and Dorothy, especially when the going gets tough. Both actresses are perfectly cast. Jane has some great lines and delivers them with acerbic perfection. And Marilyn is sweet and spoiled and simply gorgeous all the way thru, "no matter what she might do". The music is memorable, especially the "Diamonds" number, and the clothes are to die for, especially with Marilyn and Jane wearing them. It's a great little film if you want to feel good the rest of the day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried to like this, since this movie shows that beautiful women have brains, too. But the songs rarely have anything to do with the scene, Russell looks better when facing the other way (someone should have shot her hairstylist), and Monroe sounds better when she's not talking.Marilyn Monroe plays a girl obsessed with one thing: finding a guy rich enough to shower her with diamonds, complacent enough to do anything she says, and dumb enough to lose every argument. She casts her lure at every guy she sees, even though she's already engaged to the guy she just described.Jane Russell plays a chaperone who's too busy getting into trouble to keep her charge out of it. Specifically, she's also engaged - in an exercise of futility - that of landing a beefcake who will stop exercising long enough to notice her. Eventually she does get her happily-ever-after in a poor guy willing to sacrifice his morals for her beauty.The only reason to watch this atrocity is to drool over Monroe and Russell in their prime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singers Lorelei Lee (Marilyn Monroe) and Dorothy Shaw (Jane Russell) travel to Paris by ship, but get more than they bargained for when the father of Lorelei's husband-to-be hires a private detective to keep tabs on Lorelei. On the journey, Lorelei gets herself many admirers and Dorothy finds herself falling in love with the private detective who's spying on Lorelei.This film certainly opens with a bang with a couple of colourful and lively musical numbers. However, it's once the musical numbers pass by and the 'narrative' takes over that the picture starts to suffer somewhat. The problem here is that the story itself is very weak and isn't particularly interesting. It doesn't help that more of the focus seems to be put on Lorelei's character who is both shallow and dim-witted - although the writers do at least show at times that her character may not be as dim as we think, but sadly examples of this are few and far between. I would have preferred it if Russell's character had been developed more as she was definitely the more interesting of the two characters.Marilyn Monroe isn't the greatest of actresses and this does show in this picture, but she is still OK here (basically playing another 'dumb blonde' like she did in Some Like It Hot). Jane Russell is much better and gives a much more natural performance. Her character is sassy, ballsy and lots of fun - it's just a pity that her character is underwritten here.Although it's an uneven film there are certainly laughs to be found here and there; the scene where Lorelei gets stuck in the window was funny and Jane Russell's take on Marilyn Monroe towards the end was priceless. The finale was nice even if the resolution to the story was a little lame and corny.All in all this isn't a 'classic' film or even a 'great' film - the story is too thin and there aren't enough laughs for it to have the words 'classic' or 'great' associated with it. However, it is fun at times, the musical numbers are lively and Jane Russell gives a very spirited performance. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is an OK film, but just not all it's cracked up to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Infectious, glossy musical comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I lost count at about the eighth costume change. Howard Hughes' picture isn't an MGM musical by any means. It's more a pageant, a parade of the exclusive, expensive and exotic. I think the key conceit is making Marilyn Monroe not just ditzy but plain stupid - she becomes the sink hole of desire into which men are easily sucked and takes the pressure off the real performance of the film, that of Jane Russell.The opportunity to see this film has come up due to the recent, unhappy news of Russell's death. I can see how this is a loss. A beautiful woman who can act, Russell can also sing (or appear to sing) and is also, manifestly, something of a pro - her 'fall' into the pool at the end of the Ain't There Anyone Here for Love? sequence was no fall but her being cracked in the back of the head with the knee of a diving man.Despite her irritating stoned-whisper delivery, it can't be denied that Monroe looks luminous on screen beside Russell and the women clearly have chemistry. No-one else comes near them, as an attraction of the film, although I liked Charles Coburn's turn as the lecherous diamond magnate Piggy.I think what I love above all about this and other films of this period is the wonderfully saturated colour and correspondingly hyper-present picture. The faces of the actresses are unreal but irresistible. Add to that one or two infectious song numbers - I absolutely loved Bye Bye Baby - and its a guaranteed hit. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the most ridiculous and pretentious movies I have ever seen. The plot line is so simplistic it feels like it was written in an hour. The costumes and set pieces are so over-the-top extravagant you feel they are trying to make you appreciate the numbers. Nearly every male character is a stiff, mindless drone who simply drools over every woman on screen. Yet, this musical adaptation works on some strange note most likely thanks to stars Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell.I was surprised to see this was a Broadway musical and that is probably where it should have stayed. Nevertheless, how could any producer resist the fact of dressing up Monroe in ridiculously outlandish dresses and prance around while her hips and chest jiggle sensually? As I said before, nearly every male in this movie has no place except to stand around and mindlessly obey these beautiful women's orders, proving once again the sheer stupidity and futileness of the male species. The only characters really worth two thoughts are Henry Spofford III who absolutely upstages Monroe and the French magistrate who is able to keep a straight head during a number.If you are a serious film fan, this is pure fluff that you will forget relatively quickly. Yet, I say you should see it if only because Marilyn Monroe is an immortal goddess and it's important for every male to be reminded of that every once in awhile. Howard Hawks couldn't believe the lengths of idiocy Monroe would go during some scenes and some of her lines feel done by herself rather than scripted. But, there is no doubt she is one of if not the most beautiful creature ever to appear on celluloid. Watching this once is enough, but keep in mind you still need to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These days, when the stock exchanges around the world are trembling, diamonds are much better than men with lots of papers, soon to be valueless. Excellent film, beautifully restored, entertaining and wise, where the men are stupid and the street-wise girls takes the loot!The acting by Monroe and Russell is just perfect, their singing even more so, the male actors portray men that are just as stupid, single-minded and gullible as only men can be. It is also a very true story where the ugly girls get nothing, while the ugly boys get anything, as long as they're rich. There is nothing bad with this movie - the lighting, the cinematography, the costumes and dresses, all are just right! Russell's own version of Monroe's "Diamonds are a girl's best friend" in the French court of justice is a lovely spoof of many dimensions, not least Russell's imitation of Monroe, which is done with a lot of heart!Naturally it helped the director a lot that the film was based on a successful play that in turn was based on a successful book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a riot, not to mention that it practically comes off a feminist statement (two women doing quite well on their own, and on their own terms) in an era that never even heard the term "feminism." Most people will tell you that this is Monroe's movie, and she certainly acquits herself with her "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" number. But Russell's no slouch either -- check out "Anyone Here for Love?" (much ballyhooed in recent years for its gay subtext -- how could so much beefcake ignore the busty Russell??) and Russell's courtroom parody of Monroe in which she shakes everything she's got (far sexier than "The French Line," in which she was *supposed* to be a sex bomb). An absolute hoot from start to finish, in no small part due to those "two little (sic) girls from Little Rock."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fantastic film. Everyone looks like they're having a great time. Hawks claims that it was just meant as a huge joke, to have women looking for men rather than vice versa and to subvert the traditional movie plot lines. Set on a cruise going toward Paris, the film is witty, droll and incredibly fast paced. The script is littered with memorable one liners. Monroe sparkles like her diamonds and Russell looks just fab in her black trouser suit in the decidely homoerotic 'Ain't there anyone here for love?' (not for you, Janey!!) The film cleverly plays on the 1950s obsession with artifice and gloss, right down to the dyed shiny blonde hair beloved of 'gentlemen' everywhere. It is the women who win in this - Monroe for once gets to use her sex appeal to get what she wants. The men are all old, children, in bed before nine or bundled off wearing a frilly dressing gown!!One of my favourites, you can watch this again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A seemingly dumb, money-addict blonde bombshell and her beautiful and tart brown friend go to Paris; the former prepares to marry a weak-willed young millionaire and his father hires a private eye to look after the girls during the journey.One of the stories by Anita Loos resulted in a 1928 screen version; then it turned to an enormously successful stage musical by Jule Styne and Hoagy Carmichael with Carol Channing, let alone to the screen in 1953. This glossy entertainment has no virtual narrative drive, and the story line seems sillier than most. But the ear-tickling, marvelously staged numbers, flavoured with the gay, sparkling air of the whole enterprise, make for an enjoyable nonsense, and the leading ladies' generally refreshing witticism, through which they overshadow all their male partners (except perhaps Charles Coburn) make the script seem more sophisticated than it actually is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There can be no denying it - As it was so clearly evident here in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, the marvellous wonder of Technicolour and the dynamic radiance of Marilyn Monroe were, without question, made for each other.In this slick and sassy Musical/Comedy from 1953, Monroe plays showgirl, Lorelei Lee, a somewhat clueless gold-digger, who isn't all that concerned about a guy's age or looks, just as long as he's got plenty of cash to throw around in order to buy her expensive presents.Even though Monroe, as usual, looked positively sensational here, I personally think that her talent as an actress was totally wasted in this silly, shallow and preposterous film.With plenty of sexual innuendo squeezed into its dialogue, the highlight of this moderately entertaining picture was (again) the gorgeous Marilyn, in a hot-pink, strapless dress, doing a sizzling "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend" number.The only reason to watch this film is to see Marilyn Monroe at her absolute loveliest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film may have the same stereotypical dipsy blonde character (and actress) as Some Like It Hot, but this is a whole different film, a great musical comedy. Basically Dorothy Shaw (Jane Russell) and Lorelei Lee (Marilyn Monroe) two famous lounge singers, or "Two Little Girls from Little Rock", and they are going on a cruise ship working their way to Paris. On the journey, they are enjoying the company of men, Lorelei particularly has a hunger for rich men and diamonds, so she can't resist dopey diamond mine owner Sir Francis 'Piggy' Beekman (Charles Coburn). She may be dipsy, but she gets her own way with her sexiness, almost as much as Dorothy does. But problems occur when sneaky photographer, and Dorothy's love interest, Gus Esmond (Tommy Noonan) snaps Lorelei and Piggy together, so she and Dorothy are now trying to get the film back, and this is where the film descends into a justice thing. Also starring Elliott Reid as Lorelei's fiancée, Ernie Malone. Marilyn Monroe was number 39 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, she was number 6 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, she was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols (she could have been number 1), and she was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" was number 12 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, and the film was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Musicals.

		<fullReview>''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes''is one of those classics that everybody should watch someday. Both Jane Russel and Marilyn Monroe are great and their clothes,make up and musicals are beautiful as well. Since this is the first time I watched this movie, I immediately remembered Madonna's video clip ''material Girl'' and also Satine's number in 'Moulin Rouge'were she (Nicole Kidman) sings 'Diamonds are the Girl's Best Friend'',all copied from this film. We have in the story two girls: Lorelei Lee and Dorothy Shaw. They are best friends and both work in a Cabaret,and at same time they are friends, they are very different from each other, since their personalities until their looks: Lorelei, the blonde, only thinks in men's money, while Dorothy, the brunet, does not care at all and have a more mature personality. One day, they both are going to make a trip to France in a ship and Dorothy was going to take care of Lorelei's behavior for Gus Esmond, Lorelei's fiancé. At the same time, a private detective called Ernie Malone, was contracted by Mr. Esmond(Gus' father) to take pictures of Lorelei making out with other guys, because Mr. Esmond is against his son's marriage to Lorelei.(knowing her big interest for rich guys) Many things happens in the ship,and when Lorelei meets a very rich guy called Sir Francis Beekman(Piggy), the owner of many diamonds, many problems starts to happen.aka "Os homens preferem as loiras" - Brazil</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't watched that many Howard Hawks movies. The only one I have watched is The Thing From Another World and my thoughts are that it's a pretty good monster movie but it's also based on a book with a much better adaptation. I also haven't really seen Marilyn Monroe in anything except for Some Like It Hot and she was serviceable in that movie. However, I don't really like this movie.The plot... Marilyn has seduced a young, socially awkward millionaire into marrying her, which considering Marilyn's image gives off the impression she's kind of a gold digger... That's not true, she's exactly a gold digger, even telling her friend that she really should consider going after a millionaire because "money=true love". However she's also a complete airhead and even has the millionaire's angry father hire someone to take incriminating looking photographs of her with another millionaire. To make matters worse when Marilyn's friend uncovers what's going on with her help she gets the innocent millionaire to give her his wife's diamond tiara. When they get to Paris they're obviously in deep sh#t as the wife thinks they've stolen it and the millionaire takes the photographs the wrong way.Neither of the lead characters are sympathetic at all. Marilyn Monroe's character is a gold digger and Jane Russel goes after any "tall dark and handsome man" she can find. I can't sympathize with a character that wants to spend years in prison because she doesn't want to part ways with a diamond tiara, even though she's marrying a millionaire! She even admits outright at the end that all she's after is money. Maybe this character might have flown in 1953 but I really struggle with this. Jane Russel is more likable to me but that's not saying a goddamn thing.So everything about the lead characters are unappealing, but honestly - that's probably where my problems with the movie begin and end... Seriously, Monroe might have had this constant image but she does what she can and while I honestly didn't care for the music, I wouldn't say any of them are horrible (except Ain't There Anyone Here For Love, sorry if my maturity is brought into question but I'm inherently a straight male and I don't want to see muscular men flex their muscles, lift weights and exercise while wearing nothing but peach coloured shorts), I didn't mind the cinematography either.All in all, this is something I will probably forget immediately after seeing it. This really doesn't have anything to come back to, except maybe "Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend". I'd say watch it if you want to but for me personally, this is just really unmemorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently I have been caught in the web of Marilyn fever, after MY WEEK WITH MARILYN (2011) and the season finale of SMASH (even Uma Thurman could pull off a slender doppelgänger Marilyn), I decide watch this musical/burlesque to quench my thirst and hope to know more about her, the mysterious actress whose shallowness is rather not compatible with our requirement of an eternal icon (after her two more prominent flicks, SOME LIKE IT HOT 1959 and THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH 1957).The film pairs a soft kitten Marilyn with a pointed Jane Russell, to counterpart not only the hair color, also conceive two precious opposite temperaments between them, and they're indeed BFFs to each other (at least in the film they claim to be). In this Howard Hawk's vaudeville, with the help of Russell, the showgirl comfort zone is the haven for Monroe to perform right on her own track and never mitigates its plain entertaining function, given that one could forget about the tacky script (one unexplained plot hole, how the detective fathom the whereabouts of the tiara?).As a musical, the film's highlight is no doubt the classic musical numbers, an extravagant DIAMONDS ARE A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND, a faintly saccharine WHEN LOVE GOES WRONG and a stunning open track A LITTLE GIRL FROM LITTLE ROCK.While adamantly preaching the equality between women's beauty and men's money, the film could barely survive under the circumstance now, but these two actresses should not take the blame and on the contrary, it is their persistent endeavor makes the film still watchable after almost 60 years.Marilyn is never a versatile player, all her films I have watched so far have strenuously concocted her image as a blonde slightly dumb but with a genuine naiveness beneath her luscious body, even she is a fervent gold digger, her portrayal emits a sort of realness which could arouse rather empathy than contempt. So what will be the next Marilyn's movie for me? Any suggestion?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a moment near the end of the film where the character of Ms. Lee completely shifts from a flighty filly to a woman who has gotten where she is in life off of her street smarts and her understanding of love. To me this is why the film will always be revisited. The first hour or so is a silly, lighthearted musical about Lorelei Lee trying to avoid getting caught flirting and using her sex appeal to get out of potentially precarious situations. Then, without warning, the tone shifts just slightly and all of a sudden Lorelei Lee is a confident businesswoman who happens to be dealing in male hearts. It's a subtle but powerful change, and Marilyn Monroe completely nails it. It all fits in that one moment, the whole story makes sense. Rating: 30/40</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two singers, best friends Lorelei Lee (Marilyn Monroe) and Dorothy Shaw (Jane Russell) travel to Paris pursued by a private detective hired by Lorelei's fiancé's disapproving father to keep an eye on her, a rich, enamored old man and many other doting admirers.German film director Rainer Werner Fassbinder declared this one of the ten best films ever made. I do not share that opinion. While I liked it, and some of the humor is pretty good (especially the kid), the musical numbers did not suit me. Well, there was that issue of the unfortunate color for the men's swim trunks, coupled with a very suggestive dance number I enjoyed...As a result of the film's success, Monroe and Russell were given the chance to put their hand and feet prints in cement at Grauman's Chinese Theatre; a spectacle that got a lot of publicity for both actresses. Interestingly Russell was the film's star but today this is thought of as a Monroe film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I'm missing something here, but given this movie's reputation, I expected something. a lot better. Not that I hated it, mind you, but it just wasn't as great as I thought it would be.This movie was pretty funny, just not gut-bustingly funny. There's more then a few witty lines, but nothing too memorable. I enjoyed the two lead actresses, especially Jane Ruasel's excellent delivery of the movie's funniest lines.I also enjoyed the songs, but the choreography was really boring. The only number with interesting choreography also happens to involve half naked men, which gay men and straight women might like, but made me rather uncomfortable. And considering this is a Technicolour Hollywood musical, I expected more epic numbers.Bottom Line: I guess I can't complain, but I just expected more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless jewel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a must watch - the opinion of so many viewers, but on the other hand quite a few people complain about the shallow story and too obvious characters. It's a paradox, which we should look closer at. My guess is that this is a movie with a key (like a book with a key). Look at Lorelei Lee properly and you will notice that her character is about an opposite to the real character of Marilyn Monroe who never (or very rarely) put on a jewelry (and was certainly not stupid). So that that persona of a "dumb blond" she created so fine was never herself. I guess the same is valid also for Jane Russell, who was a devoted wife while playing a sexually concerned brunette Dorothy Shaw. Due to my embryonic knowledge of the history of Hollywood i can't say much more on this subject.Another very interesting point is about the colors in this bright picture. Jane Russell changes her dresses 15 times, Marilyn Monroe 14 times during the movie. And what is also exiting, the colors of their dresses build up a rainbow: beginning with red, they move to the white through the orange (with black), yellow (with black and white), green, light blue (with white), dark blue and lilac, to the final white (in the scene of the wedding). Actually the white is a certain summary of the rainbow colors (at least i've heard of it at the physic lesson). The rainbow is mentioned in the song of Jane Russell "i'll be gloomy, but send that rainbow to me".As to the "animal magnetism": we see the effect of Lorelei kisses upon her fiancé Gus. The boy (brilliantly played) simply formulates this in words. It's important thing to say that Lorelei is a name of Rhine Nymphe who has got supernatural power over the men. Some people call Lorelei a "man-trap" or "monster". Bytheway in the famous hit "Diamonds are a girls best friend" Lorelei mentions a "Rhine-stone", which is to be found in the legend of Lorelei (ask Brentano and Heine).Yes, the number about Napoleon would be an another jewel.As we see it's much more in this light musical comedy than one expects. So just watch it and you'll find out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marilyn Monroe Classic: Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953): Starring Marilyn Monroe, Jane Russell, Charles Coburn, Tommy Noonan, Elliot Reid, George Winslow, Taylor Holmes, Norma Varden, Howard Wendell, Alex Frazer, Marcel Dalio...Director Howard Hawkes, Screenplay Anita Loos.More than any other movie she made, including the more famous "Seven Year Itch" with the famous wind-up-the-skirt scene, "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" is Marilyn Monroe's most memorable movie. This was her first big success. She sings, dances, flirts, schemes and marries, which in a nutshell is the plot to most of her 50's film. The character of Lorelei Lee is the same type of coy, bubbly blonde social-climber/gold-digger Monroe plays in other films, but this was her Hollywood on-screen persona which American audiences enjoyed watching. Jane Russell plays her girlfriend Dorothy Shaw. Lorelei and Dorothy are showgirls, looking a lot like 50's Vegas showgirls, who perform on cruise ships. But they have an agenda. They hope to marry "up" and land a rich husband. Into their lives come two men - Ernie Malone and Gus Esmond. Lorelei is off to Paris and must temporarily leave her fiancé. She consoles herself with a rich patron, Sir Francis "Piggy" Beekman who lavishes her with expensive jewelry, money and gifts, including a diamond tiara which is eventually stolen and that lands Lorelei in legal troubles. Overall, this is a well-written, light-hearted musical with a lot of comedy, though with little heart. Both Lorelei and Dorothy come off as excessively materialistic and shallow that despite the "Marriage" at the end, we would not be surprised if both of them left their hubbies as soon as a man with a bigger wallet came along. The satire is sometimes biting, especially in its unapologetic depiction of some women as "man-traps" and as money-hungry gold diggers. The songs are cute and jazzy, very much in vogue at the time. The musical number "Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend" is reason enough to watch this classic Monroe film. It was so popular it influenced Madonna 30 something years later in her MTV video. Filmed in lush Technicolor (thank God) we can see every detail of the gorgeous cinematography and the color on the costumes, which are plenty. Marilyn Monroe is neither classy nor especially intelligent in this performance (as in others) but she oozes the sensuality and the fun blonde bit for which she was so well-known.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it wasn't for the presence of those two lovely pieces of eye candy, namely Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe, there would be no movie here.Much as I love viewing Marilyn Monroe, I had to force myself to watch this movie. I suspected it was not a very good musical. I only proved myself right by sitting through it.First, the good stuff. Marilyn and Jane. Marilyn looks delectable in every scene. Jane is no slouch either. Thank God for the great musical numbers. Monroe's "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend" is classic. Then again, you can't go too wrong picking songs out of Jule Styne's and Hoagy Carmichael's songbooks. "Just A Little Girl From Little Rock", "When Love Goes Wrong", "Bye Bye Baby" are all fine songs with clever lyrics. This is an entertaining film when you let Monroe and Russell sing and prance around.But the story is missing. Bits of dialog are humorous, but the movie is a big zero. Tommy Noonan, as the rich daddy's son, is not comedic, he is just constipated. He is the face of Male Impotence, much like Arthur Lake's over-the-top portrayal of "Dagwood Bumstead" in the terrible "Blondie" movies.Best thing to do with this film is to just record the musical numbers, and leave the rest on your cutting room floor. I will not be sitting through this one again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable but reasonably enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's certainly not any great drama in this film. It's fairly obvious very early on where this story is inevitably headed. But while there may not be much in the way of drama the film still works as light, breezy, enjoyable comedic fare. Since you know going in that this is a musical you can't be surprised when the characters suddenly break into song now and again. Some of the musical numbers are truly memorable, most are at least passable with maybe only one or two really falling flat. Above all else what this film has going for it is the quality of the performances turned in by its two leads, Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell. Both actresses fall into their roles perfectly, playing off one another brilliantly as they light up the screen. Whenever the film threatens to hit a lull this duo sparks it back into life. It is certainly a film which has its lesser moments but the good outweighs the bad and for that almost all of the credit has to go to Monroe and Russell.The plot here is almost criminally simple. Monroe plays Lorelei Lee and Russell plays Dorothy Shaw. The two are showgirls and, despite the fact they seem to have very little in common, best friends. Monroe's Lorelei is the quintessential gold-digger, whose interests consist solely of diamonds and men who can buy her diamonds. Russell's Shaw is more down to earth, interested more in the man than the man's wallet. Anyhow, Lorelei is engaged to Gus Esmond who is, of course, quite rich and whose father does not approve of this union. When our two girls end up on a cruise to Europe the father hires a private detective, Ernie Malone, to spy on Lorelei and dig up some dirt. Almost inevitably while watching Lorelei the detective falls for Dorothy. Suffice to say complications ensue. And that's about it for plot. There's more singing and dancing and there are some witty comedic moments. Some of the jokes fall flat, some of the musical numbers miss the mark but in the end you'll probably be left with a smile on your face. Perhaps not surprisingly the best musical moments the film has to offer are when the showgirls are actually up on stage doing their thing such as in the opening number and in the iconic Monroe performance of "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend". When our heroines suddenly break into song on a sidewalk things don't work quite as well. While if you had to choose one you'd probably call Monroe the "star" of the movie Russell really does match her stride for stride. Russell's big solo number, "Anyone Here for Love?" is rather campy and certainly doesn't match Monroe's "Diamonds" moment. But near the end Russell gets another showpiece in one of the film's most surprising and funniest moments. And when they're not busy with all the singing and dancing, when they're just talking, Russell's Dorothy often steals the show with her sharp, dry wit. Working together, with abundant and obvious chemistry, Monroe and Russell make this movie work. It's no masterpiece but it's a reasonably enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But the brunette stole the movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: Showgirls Lorelei Lee and Dorothy Shaw are inseparable, although they are very different in their hunt for men. Lorelei prefers men with big wallets, or better yet, men with a lot of diamonds to spare. Dorothy looks for true feelings, regardless of money. So when Lorelei travels to Europe in preparation to wed her fiancé Gus, the son of a wealthy businessman, Dorothy tags along as a sort of chaperon. But Gus's father disapproves of his son's choice of wife-to-be and hires a detective to spy on them, find a scandal that might stop the wedding. Trouble arises immediately when Lorelei finds an older man with a diamond mine and Dorothy becomes attracted to the detective (after her initial disappointment with the American Olympic Team)...Comments: Based upon a musical, as is evident in the movie because of several songs. Well-performed and keeping within the story I admit, but it also means that focus is split between being a good musical and a funny comedy. So this is not a hilarious movie, not in the way another Monroe-movie Some like it hot (1959) was. Yes, small jokes and some funny scenes but nothing fancy.And as for the actresses, Monroe is the biggest star but it is Russell that gives the best performance. Monroe is good as Lorelei, but her line "I can be smart when it's important, but most men don't like it" sums it up pretty good. Her character becomes a little stereotypical, passive and shallow, although she can be more active when it suits her. The protagonist is instead Dorothy, played by Russell. Also very beautiful, and with an active character with more obvious depth (and actually given more focus in the movie), the movie is hers.A classical, worth watching but not really up there with the best...A peculiar note is that the actors behind the couple Lorelei and Gus, Monroe and Noonan, both died prematurely.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why not two blondes?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be true to its title, this film really needed a pair of blondes as the show act - as it is, we have the twee-voiced, bird-brained Marilyn Monroe with the stunning brunette Jane Russell.Lorelei Lee (Monroe) and Dorothy Shaw (Russell) are in Europe on money provided by Lorelei's beau, Gus Esmond (Tommy Noonan, a man resigned to his fate if ever there was one), but she can't resist the lure of a diamond. First there's Piggy, an elderly Lord with an eye for a pretty girl (Charles Coburn), and then there's Henry Spofford (I won't spoil the joke about him). And of course the obligatory private detective, this time Ernie Malone (Elliott Reid), a bit of love interest for Dorothy.'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes' has a few good musical numbers too - notably 'Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend', a showcase for Monroe (and later reprised in a courtroom by Russell). The opening number is 'Two Little Girls From Little Rock' and it sets the scene just perfectly. Not a fabulous musical by any means, but a good time-passer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that I am going to get some pretty angry e-mails from at least a few people, as is almost always the case when I write scathing reviews of popular movies. I realize that Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is a classic comedy, and not only because it stars Marilyn Monroe. But therein lies my biggest problem with the film. Marilyn Monroe is not very arguably the most famous blonde who ever lived, and in this movie she glorifies air-headedness and the prostitution of the female form for financial gain. Before I go on, by the way, I would like to point out that she delivered a wonderful performance and I am saying nothing against either her as an actor or as a person, but this role should probably not have been given to her because her tremendous iconography gives her the power to influence a great many women, and the influence delivered in this movie is not a very healthy one, especially in the early 1950s.I was shocked when I read the review on the IMDb's title page for Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. `TJBNYC,' as he or she calls him- or herself, starts out by saying that `Anyone who's ever written off Marilyn Monroe as 'just' a dumb blonde are directed to this film immediately.' I think it would be a better idea to point out to anyone that's ever written off Marilyn Monroe as `just' a dumb blonde be reminded of the nature of the medium of film. What you see on screen are characters and if the actor makes you believe a character is a dumb blonde, it goes to the credit of their acting ability. But more important than that, this is probably the last film that someone like that should be directed to see because a dumb blonde is exactly what she portrays. If, however, you manage to make it through to the end of this endurance test, you will see that they luckily made an effort to show that she had something going on in her head all along, even though this effort is a feeble and almost entirely futile one.(spoilers) On the one hand, Marilyn Monroe plays a character named Lorelei Lee who says things with wide-eyed innocence (oblivion) like, `Piggy was playing the python, and I was the goat.' and `This is like a room, isn't it!' I always feel dumber after watching stuff like that, but I suppose there is some intelligence to her character that becomes apparent as we realize her cunning ability to get the pretty things that she likes by using whatever power she has available. Sure, this is completely useless knowledge to anyone but an air-headed blonde, but there you go. Lorelei has something going on in her head after all. The real point where they vainly attempt to cancel out her blondeness is at the very end when she turns everything around and Gus's father comes right out and says, `Hey, they told me you were stupid!'What you have here is a shameless attempt to deliver Marilyn as a complete bimbo and then try to suddenly turn it around at the end to make it seem that she was putting us on the whole time and she's really not a moron after all. The problem that Howard Hawks should have kept in mind is that the audience forms their opinion of a character very early in a movie, and if we see a bimbo for 90 minutes, she stays a bimbo no matter how smart she acts in the last scene. There is nothing spectacular about Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, there are even several scenes that are downright bad or tasteless or both, such as the goat/python scene mentioned above (with a scene like this, NO amount of genius later in the film could reverse Lorelei's idiot character) and the truly awful scene where Laura sings `Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend' in a skanky outfit to distract everyone. I can only imagine it is now considered a classic because Marilyn Monroe is the star. I haven't seen many of her other films, but I can only hope that they are better than this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is something of a contradiction in terms, a 'musical' with only five songs, three of which are all that survive from a full Broadway score by Jule Styne and Leo Robin and two tacked on which were commissioned from Hoagy Carmichael and Harold Adamson. Even then the movie is dominated by Diamonds Are A Girls' Best Friend, one of the survivors from Broadway - the other two being Bye, Bye, Baby and I'm Just A Little Girl From Little Rock (which was the original title as performed by Margo Channing on Broadway but which was adapted to accommodate a duet between Monroe and Russell). It's interesting that Marilyn was billed second to Jane Russell, already an established star, though they get more or less equal screen time. Tommy Noonan - who would have much more gravitas the next year in the Judy Garland version of A Star Is Born - and Elliot Reed were barely noticeable as the respective love interests whilst Charles Coburn and Taylor Holmes weighed in with neat cameos all but eclipsed by Marcel Dalio as the judge. Pleasant but far from great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am in love with Marilyn Monroe, she was the defining beauty of all Hollywood movie stars before there was such a thing as the Hollywood Heart throb. I had heard quite a bit of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and this was the defining role that really made Marilyn the icon she is still to this day. So, I had to rent this movie without delay.I found myself not only admiring a movie star, but falling in love with another classic movie. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is like the very first ditzy blonde movie that makes you laugh from beginning to end. I know this is kind of a horrible thing to say, but I admired Dorthy and Lorelei's characters. Yes, they were gold diggers, but I loved how they knew they could get anything they want with just a wink of their eyelashes. Their confidence and glamour was so sexy and it's everything I wanted to be when I was a little girl. Not the gold digger part :P."Diamonds are a girl's best friend" is one of the most memorable songs I will always once in a while get stuck in my head. Marilyn made the song so memorable and fabulous. I will always recommend Gentlemen Prefer Blondes for a girl's night in! This is a great romantic comedy that anyone could enjoy! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I found some very funny parts to this movie aboard ship, I think that once the "girls" get to Paris the movie falls apart. We have this long, drawn out song "When Love Goes Wrong, Nothing Goes Right" that grinds this movie to a halt. The second half is your typical song and dance movie with the remaining storyline getting pushed to the side to showcase flashy dance routines. Yes, we have "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend" which for whatever reason is burned into people's minds as being a defining iconic moment for Mariyln. Perhaps it is. However when Jane dons a blonde wig in court and does this song I wince with inconvertibility! It's rather bizarre to say the least. Half of the movie is quite good while the last half falls apart like an under cooked creme brulee.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title of this movie makes a point that is highly debatable - to put it kindly. I don't think that anyone in his right mind would prefer Marilyn Monroe to Jane Russell after watching them both here: Russell seems to be a more attractive woman, a better actress (her smile is natural, Monroe's is forced), a sexier dancer and she plays a "normal", likable character, while Monroe's character is appallingly lame-brained. Russell is vastly preferable, no doubt about that.As for the film, it's just a little piece of nothing, made endurable only by Russell's presence. The ironic thing is that, although there aren't enough musical numbers here for this movie to qualify as a musical, they forgot to throw in a decent plot, as well. And visually, it looks stagy and inexpensive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Pleasant, if nothing spectacular, comedy about friends Dorothy (Jane Russell) and Lorelei (Marilyn Monroe) who ends up on a cruise where they hope to find men. Dorothy wants to find and marry a poor man while Lorelei wants a rich man but her already rich fiancé sends a spy (Elliott Reid) on board to make sure she doesn't do anything naughty (which she does, of course). If you think about the film and its story too much then you'll probably walk away disappointed because if you do think too much you'll probably find something in every scene to rip apart. For starters, it's very, very unlikely that these two characters would really be friends as they're simply too different. They have nothing in common and it's doubtful one would put up with the morals or beliefs of the other. You could also argue that the characters just change and go as the film does with them changing personalities just to suit whatever a certain scene calls for. There's quite a bit more that you could rip on but this movie just tries to be fun and for the most part it is. I think the main reason to watch this is for the cast and there's no doubt that director Hawks knew that the skin of Russell and Monroe would bring people in. I'm not sure how the two stays in some of these outfits that they were in as the flick shows enough leg for three movies and how those bodies didn't come flying out at any second must have taken quite a bit of time to get under control. Both actresses shake their hips when they walk and put enough attitudes into their roles to be very charming. Russell, of course, plays the tougher one with Monroe's character, at times, playing smart but at other times being a complete dope. Reid and Gus Esmond are both good in their roles but it's Charles Coburn who really steals the film as a millionaire who Monroe tries to steal on the cruise. I found the entire courtroom scene at the end to be quite bad and there's no doubt that the screenplay has some major issues but, again, I think the movie just wants to be fun. Some of the music highlights include When Love Goes Wrong, Bye Bye Baby, A Little Girl from Little Rock and the now legendary Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I prefer redheads. Monroe is overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Norma Jeane Mortenson - or Marilyn Monroe - as the world would come to know her, became America's most iconic actress, model, singer, and sex symbol. Her well best role known since Seven Year Itch would be Gentlemen Prefers Blondes. While some people like this movie, others find it and its stars horrible. Howard Hawks directed this 1953 musical comedy starring Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe. Sadly Jane Russell nearly is forgotten in this movie due to the popularity of Monroe when Jane Russell is a better actress than Monroe. In some scenes in the movie, it's looks like Monroe was on drugs or high reading her lines. I do have to say, the comedy moments are OK, at best, the songs are very catchy and yes nobody can forget the song 'Diamonds are a girl's best friend'. It was so popular, that Madonna tribute or rip the scene off for her music video in the 1990's later sang by Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge (2001).The movie has that intentionally kitschy, that it looks even stylish, a kind of colorful look to it. What's the most disappointment in the movie is the story--Lorelei Lee (Marilyn Monroe) a gold digger is still a gold digger by the end of the film. The characters don't learn anything, or change a bit. Lorelei want to attracts a rich husband is one of the only ways a woman of the 1950s can succeed economically. Sadly it's doesn't build independent, even in 1950's it's pretty outdated idea when the 1950's saw an large number of women entering the work place. It's bad enough because it reduces human relationships to "what can you give me?" Lorelei, feeling she deserves a reward, persuades Piggy to give her his wife's diamond tiara as a thank-you present. Lorelei wanted another the woman, that the man is trying to cheat's tiara. That's pretty awful. Also, people who do this tend to be underhanded- they don't make it apparent that they just want money and nice things- and instead act like they really love that person unconditionally. So this "lying" can lead to hurt feelings. But if someone was straight forward about it (as you actually appear to be!) than I wouldn't judge you for it! (I just wouldn't want to date you). It is a form of prostitution as you are selling sex for money. It's not the right message to tell to women. That's why the film fails? it has little to no message. It's just a 1950's song and dance number with not -education moral values. This is why there are Paris Hilton, Anne Nicole Smith, and Lindsey Lohan running around in this world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" represents topnotch entertainment. Provided with a practically nonexistent plot, the script of the film isn't proper enough, but that's pardonable, because the movie is such a delight to watch. The musical numbers are a treat and there are some great gags, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lorelei's revised diary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was my first Marilyn movie. The only reason I rented it wasbecause I wanted to compare it with Anita Loos's novel (sametitle). Needless to say, the novel is a lot better. The novel isactually amazing (as amazing as humor can get), it's Lorelei'sdiary, and the trip to Europe (not only France) is only a sub-plot.The novel is definitely a lot richer (and interesting) than the movie.If you like Dorothy Parker, you will like the novel --it's the same typeof the Prohibition/1920's wit and humor. This said, the movie is an interesting desecration of the novel, andif you don't like musicals, parts of this are downright ridiculous (I'mthinking of the court scene). I also don't understand why Frenchwaiters have Greek accents; I would have thought that Hollywoodwas (and still is) swarming with enough people of all talents,lineages and accents to find suitable actors. I don't think Marilyn isa good choice for Lorelei either, there's too much glamour here,and it takes the humor away. I expected her to be a worse actressthough. I think her voice is a factor in her success in general (butnot for this movie. I think of Lorelei's voice as more squeaky). Idon't think Jane Russell is a good Dorothy either; she's tooaggressive and not witty enough for Dorothy (and why the heck didthe director decide to dub her voice in the trial scene? That wastotally pointless).So if you want to give this story another chance --and you should--,read the book (available in the Penguin and Norton editions),because that's really worth it. It also has a sequel, "But Gentlemenmarry Brunettes."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, unfunny and boring film that adds nothing to the table</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is just plain pathetic and dull. Sorry, fans of 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes' but is my honest opinion.The musical parts are very well choreographed, and while the actresses have a very beautiful voice, they simply can't act. Horrible acting performance in the musical Numbers. But they were somewhat convincing when not singing, as futile women.The plot was as generic as it could be. It had a meaningless message and a very cliché build up. The intended jokes were plain dull and unfunny. I know that humor is relative, but I'm pretty sure that that glorifying muscled athletes in a sexual way and doing a musical number into a courtroom while the judge is yelling 'outrageous!' are not funny things at all. It's just dull. And not in a funny way, which is worse.And there is nothing that really can raises interest about this film. First because is nothing new, and two because as a comedy film this one is a fail, as i said previously. Cliché moments are frequent in this film, so if you really wanna watch it, be prepared for the dullness and the super predictable events in this film.In my opinion, you should avoid this film. 4.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"...just dumb."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're reading this review, the chances are you're a fan of this movie and want to read like minds just reiterating your own opinion. Sorry, but I'm afraid I detest screwball comedies possibly more than any other film genre.It doesn't quite qualify as for that category as it lacks pace and frantic urgency, but it still falls in the same ballpark of watered down vaudeville pitched solely at the lowest common denominator. There's a rule that says nothing dates faster than comedy, but I don't believe this is a universal truth. Look at Chaplin, or Laurel and Hardy - while not cynical in a modern day sense, they're sufficiently well made and self-aware to stand up to contemporary appeal. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes isn't especially well made and its "snappy" one-liners and comic rejoinders crumble in the light of the 21st century.I only finally got round to seeing this one off the back of a film studies course, but is it really relevant to be discussing Mulvey's Male Gaze theory or Howard Hawk's auteurism - even the patronage of race - against a film that was clearly made for the least discerning of audiences? Basic plot concerns a husband-poaching golddigger and the town bike trying to get a significant other... with non-hilarious consequences.It goes without saying that Monroe's thespic skills are a triumph of style over ability, but it's equally distressing to see a weak supporting cast mistiming gags with increasing regularity and mauling their lines like the entire production were eating ham sandwiches while performing. Speaking of performing, over 22 minutes are given over to five musical numbers, which Monroe and Russell deliver in their deeply average voices. The only one to actually have any real validity is, naturally, Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend, (Marilyn Horne dubbing for Monroe on the tricky bits) though having a reprise isn't a good thing. If your idea of comedy is having a "dizzy" sound effect playing when a woman with dyed hair kisses a man, then maybe this is for you. Best bit? Possibly Russell's impersonation of Monroe in the court sequence, topped only by the fact that it ends. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just to be different...I disliked this quite a lot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Evidently lots of people really like this, but I found it infantilising and reasonably offensive codswallop, saved from oblivion by Jane Russell and a couple of memorable musical numbers, especially the opener (but there's a marked dip in invention later on). I don't get on with Monroe - she's supposed to be playing a dumb blonde who ain't that dumb, but she just comes over as dumb. Russell can't quite convince when she claims never to have been in a gymnasium, but is otherwise rather wonderful. The men are staggeringly uninteresting, as is the plot. By no means atrocious, but so patchy that, if this is a classic, God help us all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is hardly good, not great at all. A few memorable scenes and the unlucky choice of pairing Norma Jean with an actual actress. Jane Russell has it all working for her, Marilyn's lesser woman and/or actress. One can only wonder why this is considered being one of the highlights of her lame career. 3/10</fullReview>
