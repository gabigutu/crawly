		<shortDescription>funny ,clever movie...keeps you on your toes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An enjoyable funny film with a well written story and several surprises which made one or two of the audience in front of me sit bolt upright. The plot is well written with considerable imagination.. and whilst the clever ones amongst you will guess what is coming next , there are a few scenes which caught my audience 'off guard'and made them jump ! I do not want to give the game away, but there are good 'time travel' loops which will amuse those of you who are not even sci-fi lovers. Both the females add glamour.. and whilst there are probably no 'Oscar' performances, the three guys are funny and well cast as 'ordinary blokes'some clever non hi-tech trick shots and surprises right up to the final credits !.. and listening to departing audience comments there were plenty of happy people leaving the theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shaun of the Dead - But with Time Travel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so the acting isn't the best. Neither are the special effects. Despite this, I've been thoroughly entertained and captivated for the entirety of the last 80 minutes by an excellent plot that keeps you on your toes, genuinely excellent humour and enough confusion to keep you thinking but not to frustrate. Unexpected twists are everywhere, but the great thing about them is that they all make sense when the movie is over, which is something some of the more recent Hollywood Sci-Fi's could take note of. It's actually a shame that one of the independent distributors with a bit more cash to burn didn't get hold of the script, I honestly think this could have been a box-office success with the right marketing.This won't be winning any Oscars in the near future, but let's be honest; who gives a damn?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about three mates talking about time travel in a pub. They ended up doing some actual time travelling much to their surprise.Most time travel films do not make sense or have serious plot holes, but this plot is great. The story is creative, clever and well written. It keeps me interested and engaged throughout the film. The three mates are authentic and unpretentious, just like real characters we meet on a daily basis. This enhances the attraction of the film, making it even more engaging.Full length films under 80 minutes usually are bad, but "Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel" is a pleasant exception! I really enjoyed watching "Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel", and I would recommend it to my friends without hesitation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun for the grey matter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were times whilst I was watching this that I felt myself to be distinctly chronologically challenged by the implications of (people) being able to go backwards and forwards in time. Not that that detracted from my enjoyment - quite the contrary - but unravelling some of the time-logic did demand that extra bit of effort on my part. The humour varies between light and off-the-cuff banter between drinking buddies at times, to potentially grave and ominous events at others. I thought the characters were likable and the screenplay was excellent (in an 'ordinary' kind of way). Maintaining my interest was helped by the juxtaposition of the everyday with the unexpected and the inclusion of an uncertain romantic element. A nice blend of sci-fi and scepticism. Great fun for the grey matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, witty and original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great little movie about the Chaos Theory.If you enjoy any SciFi (mainly DoCWho) you should give this little flick a watch if it ever pops up on your set.Acting is very solid from Dowd who carries the film perfectly, the other actors keep pretty safe but Dowd really shines, Farris is ditsy as usual but is very cute and likable as a character (and a person) still.Direction is quite minimalistic and just focuses on the chaos itself and hardly relies on modern visual effects, mainly great props and sets that set a surprisingly good atmosphere considering this is a budget movieThis little movie could have a cult following if it is received well.8/10 -2 for been too short, but at least it leaves the possibly open for a sequel :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big surprise and in a good way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not sure about this film at first. Don't get me wrong, I like comedy(when it's done right of course) especially ones from the '70s, '80s and '90s, but when it is done wrong it's awful. But I was fearing whether it would be anything like the Friedberg-Seltzer spoof movies which I hated, detested even. After seeing mixed reviews and the above average IMDb rating, I decided to give it a chance.And I am glad I did, because I thought it was a good movie, not outstanding, but it was funny and smart even with its problems and limitations. Admittedly, Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel is low-budget, but it doesn't look completely slip-shod. The story is original and well structured, when the film started though I was like "oh dear" but as the film got going it got better, while the writing was funny, smart and tongue-in-cheek. The direction is competent, the music is good and the pacing I had little problem with either. The acting is spirited, especially with Chris O'Dowd and Marc Wooton who both show a lot of spontaneous boyish charm that make their characters appealing. I agree in some ways the characters border on stereotypical but the acting and writing is enough to not make it matter that much. Anna Farris starts off a little stiff but once she gets into the film and her role she gets better. Even the title was funny and amusing.Overall, I liked it. It is not the best movie I have ever seen, but it was funny and smart and it was refreshing to see something that was actually funny.(Friedberg and Seltzer take notes) 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing Thrill Of A Ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so far one of the best British comedies I've ever watched. The dialogs are funny, the story is well planned, and although you might not expect any high climax's due to it's limited production fee's, my heart was beating right out of my chest when the climax was reached!!The character development was great, the beginning was funny and charming but I was slightly worried/put off by the beginning to think it was going to be boring, but stick with it for 5 more minutes and I'll swear you won't regret it! Anna Faris delivers a great performance as she sparks the silver screen with her natural abilities of a comedian and all the other actors such as Chris O'Dowd, Dean Lennox Kelly etc.. both interacts realistically with each other, forming brilliant chemistry.This movie is for 'Science Fiction' lovers as well as people who are generally into space and time travel. There aren't any really mushy and romantic scenes, a mild sense of swearing, but all for the cynical outcome. DO WATCH! You might want to re-watch it again and again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A smart and very funny take on the science-fiction genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ray (Chris O'Dowd), Toby (Marc Wootton) and Pete (Dean Lennox Kelly) are out in the pub for the night, going through their usual rounds of beer, crisps and complaints about general things including movies, music and their dead-end lives in general. Well, they think they're facing a brick wall, but really things are about to get a little sci-fi?or, science fiction, if you're picky about that sort of thing. You see, when one of the guys goes into the toilet, he discovers that there's a "time-leak" somewhere within that causes them to leap back and forth along a timeline that risks all of them destroying the entire universe as they know it. Sound really nerdy? Well, it is. Except, it's not pedantic nerdy, but actually smart, witty and engagingly imaginer (don't ask). The resulting movie is one that excels in both situation and character comedy, whilst also telling a really good story to boot?while there are flaws in the entire design (most of which occur in the later stages as things get more and more complicated) Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel is a short, but sweet take on the science-fiction comedy that knows how to strike up a laugh or two, but not at the expense of story or character.Even though just about one of the three central actors has had major exposure on British TV and more recently, cinema, the performances are pitch-perfect. Striking a firm balance between realism and expertly timed gags, Dowd, Wootton and Kelly provide the movie with enough charm and "boy humour" to prevent the movie from sinking in a pile of convoluted, unfunny esoteric nonsense. Rather, the light-hearted presence of the three allows the feature to breathe with a sense of personality; while the film deals largely with two eccentric nerds and one slightly less nerdy partner in crime; these guys aren't your typical silver screen cutout stereotypes usually afforded to such personas. Instead, director Gareth Carrivick strives to maintain a sense of realism about his movie which permeates throughout.Rather surprisingly this manifests itself not just in the characters, but in the hammy, sci-fi plot itself which involves the three jumping around time and avoiding bumping into themselves?thus avoiding deadly paradoxes. The extent to which writer Jamie Mathieson goes to avoid even the sternest of science-fiction nerds from having a fit over Grandfather Paradoxes and erroneous Chaos Theory debauchery is extremely welcome and really helps pad out the story even more than it is. Indeed, it could be argued that even though there are numerous timelines opened throughout the course of the movie, no real conflicts or holes are created at least until the final ten minutes. From here, things to get a little bit shifty for the sake of providing an ending that will please the average audience member, but even a little wink and a nod throughout this conclusion helps keep the movie's narrative in place. What results is a story that's not only refreshing through its willingness to go weird on you, but also through the sheer fact that weird never overcomes the viewer's suspension of belief.In the end, FAQ About Time Travel does just about enough to strike a firm balance between story (which some will argue is king), character and silliness to ensure that your average viewer will be catered to. And while it isn't very likely that you will be blown away by the feature nor will it be emblazoned on your memory, the experience that is offers no matter how temporal, does well to entertain there and now. With some spot on performances and a tight script, Frequently Asked Questions is a smart and very funny take on the science-fiction genre that mixes situation with character humour effectively.- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't understand the criticisms of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FAQsATT was panned recently in Radio Times when it was shown for the first time on terrestrial TV and I don't understand why. Maybe it's because I emphasise a bit with the main characters, perhaps it was just because I was excited to turn on the TV and see a reasonably famous Hollywood star in a small-time British film but whatever the reason was I found myself thoroughly entertained. A lot of people have been saying that Anna Faris is uncomfortable in this but I didn't feel that at all; I expect she enjoyed doing something completely different to what she's used to. Meredith MacNeill too has be described as awkward and such but she's playing a character who's completely barmy and I think she expressed that well. Yes the special effects are not the best but they're not terrible. For a sci-fi (sorry, Speculative Fiction!) film there aren't many of them and rather there's more focus on dialogue and antics between the cast but I think that works; the effects are not overly distracting and the post-nuclear city I though actually looked really good. I've given this 7/10 because some things could have been tidied up and the script is not perfect. Also, there are mistakes and perhaps a slightly larger budget wouldn't have hurt. All in all I enjoyed this immensely for whatever reason and that's all that matters to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome, clever, funny film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd first like to mention that I am not any of peoples involved in this film family, or friend. Just to clear that for Globalist.I thought this film was pure gold. I thought the Actors did a superb job at playing the roles of their characters. They where witty and believable. Not once did I feel like they were just reading from the script, not once.I love Chris O'Dowd in IT Crowd, and I loved Dean Kelly in Shameless. I haven't seen Marc Wootton in anything, but I thought he delivered his part very well.I was laughing quite hard during some scenes. Maybe it's just my kind of humour, but I loved the Total Eclispe of Heart bathroom soon. I wondered if it could get any better after Pete doing it on his own, and yes it did when all 3 did it! The plot was really good too. It all seemed to flow well, and they didn't seem to be any major plot holes. It could get a little confusing to some people though. Like Pete still ran into the bathroom after he heard the glass knock over onto the paper, so how come he travelled through time still when he ran back in? Well I suppose he went back to present time, which makes sense.Anyway, I thought this film was brilliant although short, and I would recommend it anybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Brit Sci-Fi comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a British made film, actually a co-production between BBC films, Dog Lamp Films and HBO Films, but made here in the UK. I saw it mentioned last year on TV and thought it was one I would never see as it didn't make it to any of my local cinemas. But thanks to it being a BBC co-production, it aired in TV this week and I'm really glad I got to finally see it.Three friends, Ray, Toby and Pete work at an amusement park. Ray has just been sacked from his job after making his depiction of life in the Space Corps to a bunch of kids a little bit too realistic. He is a bit of a sci-fi geek and is really into the concept of time travel. Toby, also a bit of a geek, is an aspiring writer and is always jotting down ideas in a black book he always carries with him. Pete is just an ordinary guy out with his mates. After work they decide to go to the cinema and then on to the pub. They were not impressed with the film they saw and decide to write a letter to Hollywood on the back of one of the pages from Toby's book. With glasses empty, Ray is volunteered to get a round in. He goes through to the next room where he meets Cassie, a girl who claims to be from the future. She has come back to fix a hole in time. Ray initially treats this chance meeting as a joke, but things are about to get very serious for the three friends.Obviously made on a very small budget with most of the action centred on the pub, but nonetheless a very well made film. Quite a short film at only 83 minutes, but this, to me, was just about the right length. Decent performances all around, so honourable mentions must go out to; Chris O'Dowd as Ray, Marc Wootton as Toby, Dean Lennox Kelly as Pete, Anna Faris as Cassie and Meredith MacNeill as Millie.As a bit of a fan of Sci-Fi I really enjoyed this film. I found it clever and witty and it put me in mind of the great British TV comedy 'Red Dwarf', although it's not set in space. A nicely written script with likable characters and not too many clichés, to me, (and I'll probably get slagged off for this) even better than 'Shaun of the Dead' (shock!).I read that the director, Gareth Carrivick sadly died earlier this year from Leukaemia. He had worked in TV on many shows I have enjoyed over the years, particularly comedy and I think this was a good one to finish on, nice work sir! Recommended.My score: 7.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shaun of the Dead for sci-fi fans....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At least, that's what it struck me as. Not plagiarism, mind, just a treatment whereby ordinary blokes find humour in a difficult situation. In SotD, it was a zombie apocalypse. Here we have our heroes thrust into a time travel conundrum.And the script is well-written. The trio of heroes get glimpses of events in their futures which make little sense initially, only coming clear as those events unfold for real. It's quite cleverly done, in fact.The cast are not what you'd call well known. Anna Faris is by the far the most accomplished to date but this does not detract, only enhances the movie.It's a low budget production, but for all that, it delivers what it promises - humour and laughs - the whole way through. I suspect rather like SotD the particularly Britishness of the humour might not travel well across the Atlantic, but who knows.At the cinema it did rather poorly thanks to an almost complete lack of marketing and publicity. No one knew what the Hell it was about or who was in it. This is a real shame, because the movie deserves far more recognition than it has received. For example, this is probably only the fifteenth review of the movie, written in December, for a movie released in April the same year. Go figure.In any event, if you liked SotD, you should like this. It's not as funny, but it doesn't get tedious and it keeps you smiling all the way through. Worth your time if you can find it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tolerable sitcom scifi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is essentially a feature length episode of a British TV sitcom, the only thing being that the sitcom never actually existed.The movie is amusing rather than funny - the wry humour had me smiling most of the way through.The film also achieves the Red Dwarf trick of mixing genuine science fiction with everyday common or garden Brits up to their everyday common or garden lives. These lives are especially common or garden, given that the majority of the action takes place in the local pub.The three main characters are, to be frank, typical sitcom characters - broadly drawn losers - but are well played within their stereotyping. The two time-travelling women from the other side of the Atlantic don't easily sit with the overall British pub vibe, but that's not wholly a bad thing.This is not a great film by any stretch of the imagination - it is rather a slight film - but, within its limitations, it is quite enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paradoxically - or not so much - The Budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read a couple of reviews here before, and all of them after watching the movie. All the favourable ones I pretty much agree with, even though such reviewers often rated the movie a couple of stars below me. All unfavourable reviews I disagree with, and most likely also have a different approach to Cinema than that of their authors.Give me movies with flaws, but a heart, every day of the week. Gladiator and Titanic might be flawless - or close to that - on some technical points of view, but I'd never characterise such movies as being "humane". FAQATT isn't perfect, but it's perfectly humane and has a heart, hence the 10.O'Dowd cracks me up just for being himself. I don't recall seeing his two friends (the character's, that is) in any other movie, but they were anything but unlikeable. I liked Faris on "House Bunny", so I may be a bit biased when it comes to her filmography.First I thought I shouldn't mention the fact that it's a low-budget movie, since I believe that's one thing low-budget movies don't want to bring the focus to: the budget. But then again, the writer did so right in the beginning of the movie, so I think it's OK (not really a spoiler if it happens in the first couple of minutes, isn't it?).Anyways, if you're in doubt about watching this movie, I recommend you do. I did not vote 10/10 as a joke. I plan to buy this movie whenever I can just to show the people involved my appreciation. I believe the director is "not longer with us", so I hope someday I get to thank him in person (or in any other form) for this great movie.Kudos to everyone involved. As long as there are low-budget movies like this, I can walk through big multiplex theaters knowing that the end is not near.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you like the first 10 minutes, you'll love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a great little movie if you're a fan of the BritPub genre. It's a funny film with half a dozen laugh-out-loud moments - which is more than I get from most comedies these days. It's clearly inspired by Shaun of the Dead - but also too by the Narnia, Secret Garden etc doorway-to-another-world concept - albeit with a convincingly gross gents toilet in place of the wardrobe.For me it has the edge over Shaun of the Dead. This could be simply because I prefer the sci-fi parody over a horror parody. Or it could be that in this movie the characters are allowed to be aware that their "real" world still exists and hence their banal behaviour seems more appropriate. "Shaun" failed for me because it's set in a fundamentally unbelievable world - I can only take so much absurdity. For example, I loved the way when after several time trips, the three friends are back waiting for their other selves to leave the pub on an earlier time trip - but Ray thinks he has time to nip to the bar for a round of drinks while they're waiting. Priceless.Since watching the film I've read some criticisms of Anna Faris - for example "a bewildered cameo". I saw that as appropriate characterisation first time around and the same on a second viewing. From the moment we meet her, it seems pretty clear she should not be in charge of a time travel device and it's this that makes Ray's touching faith in her expertise so amusing.I think the movie will grow in popularity and the current level of criticism (eg. rottentomatoes 37%) will look a little foolish. An example - criticising a character who confuses Star Wars and Star Trek as an old gag - when it's clearly done consciously - Pete is trying to kid his two friends and it's been done as a knowing nod to the old gag. And complaining that it's appropriate only for TV - an extended "Red Dwarf" episode - seems odd in light of the fact that it was made by the BBC and we're all going to watch it on TV. I suspect a good many reviewers are forgetting that a comedy set in a pub has defined the limits of it's ambition quite clearly and we might bear that in mind</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More fun than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recall that when this came out last year, it got decidedly mediocre reviews, but I thought I'd give it a try when it turned up on TV last night. A lot more fun than I expected. The writer had a sure understanding of the genre - the written genre, not the usual film or TV genre. It didn't rely on blockbuster special effects. It was plot driven, and although not a stunningly original plot, they handled it well. OK, they couldn't really decide how to end it, and the final scenes got a bit silly (or sillier) but it worked up to them finally leaving the pub. I could see this as a short story in a British SF anthology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But I probably shouldn't have told you that ....I've just watched FAQ about Time Travel. I don't know how this movie managed to get under my radar but I'm glad it did, such was the surprise, enjoyment and genuine LOLs on watching it. Perhaps I still have it to look forward to ? Who really knows ? On to the review.FAQ about Time Travel is, essentially, a lesson for aspiring film makers in how to make a future classic by eloquently telling a great story, with a low budget, by casting three blokes who have an unbelievable night out in a pub. Seriously, you won't believe what actually happened.To best enjoy this movie you will need at least a very good understanding of time travel theory. That said, such an in depth understanding will do you no good and therein lies a paradox.Best just go with it. Hope you enjoy the film, you'll have to excuse me, that pint has gone right though me ......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film! Cult Classic for Science Fiction Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film won't make most folks top 10 list. It isn't a big production. There isn't much science or action. Yet, I have to say it is my favorite film out of those that I've seen over the last year or so. I caught it on HBO and saw that it had Chris O'Dowd from The IT Crowd. As a former IT nerd, I am a fan. After the first viewing, I DVRed the next run and watched it two more times. It is the kind of movie that you catch more on subsequent viewing because you know what to watch for the 2nd time around.While there is certainly plenty of nerd appeal, or should I say plenty for the imagineers, you don't have to love time travel books and movies to enjoy this film. There was so much hype about Avatar, yet I hated it. But I had never even heard of this movie before until I happened upon it on HBO. I loved FAQ so much that I immediately watched it again and then showed it to my husband as soon as he got home.This movie was a blast to watch. Check it out. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O'Dowd drives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am an unapologetic fanboy of all things time travel, so this movie is pretty much written and directed for people just like me. Chris O'Dowd, the guy who plays Roy from the hilarious television series The IT Crowd, leads as Ray, a recently fired entertainment park worker who, depressed from his bad day, goes with his two coworker friends to pub to sit and debate his favorite topic: time travel. Lo and behold, in short order things start getting awkward as a time traveller named Cassie (played by Anna Faris) appears, and then an actual time travel hole is found in none other than the pisser, from which comedy and paradox ensues.Any fresh perspective on time travel here? Not really. But from there, you get O'Dowd's lovable nerdiness and fascination as Ray, along with his cute romance with Cassie, as his friends much more begrudgingly try to hold on to their senses and figure the whole conundrum out. Best is Pete, the cynic nonbeliever who, as some sort of cosmic joke, ends up getting the worst of the travelling and becomes a paranoid survivalist. Allusions to other time travel movies are everywhere, including probably my favorite, a moment when the three discover that they are going to be important and famous historical figures, and trying to figure out what they will do to deserve it, one says, "Maybe we start a band..." and then the three of them think about it and decide that's ridiculous.What really goes for this movie in the long run is O'Dowd's character's utter wide-eyed excitement and dedication to experiencing this thing that he's dreamed so much about, and how it ultimately drives along all of the characters as they tag along for the ride. It's a fantasy fulfillment movie for the nerd in all of us who just wants to see what the future's like, giant murderous ants or no, and O'Dowd is particularly good for the role because he is sort of like the Michael Cera form of humor where the actor probably has more familiarity with the character than just acting, and is relatable on that level. His role here, in the IT Crowd, and in The Boat that Rocked are all essentially the same, but that character is the always relatable underdog who, whether self-conscious or no, loves what he loves and wants to share it with other people.However, I do not believe "Imagineers" is going to stick.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

Film itself was great good special effects, great plot tho somewhat confusing at times.The actors not Brad Pitt types were professional and oddly funny at times.Initially this movie appears to be poor and misdirected but that soon changes after the first few minutes.No huge bloopers, a few minor one which I'm sure we can forgive.All in all a great low budget movie well directed and produced!</fullReview>

What always work for these British comedies are the humor part and the small games and plays they make, so if you like British sitcoms or films like Shaun of the dead this is a good one for you.It has some great fun moments, but it doesn't really stick together and the wide open ending really didn't do it for me, they could have ended it by them just strolling nice and easy down the road.I guess I would have wanted more, not that it could or should explain the conundrum that time travel, or parallel universes might have/hold or the paradoxes of it all (well it kind of gives a few obvious hints of those), but it could have been more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>little gem of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>had never heard of this before, ran across it on someone's list of favorites and after watching it I can see why. it looks like the movie was made with pocket change but the main characters are so likable and the writing so clever that it reminds one at how nothing but a good idea and good execution are all that's really needed to make a movie worth watching. I was engrossed in it almost from the start and thankfully spent most of my time thinking "can't wait to see what happens next". I find that a large majority of movies are a disappointment in one way or another and by 1/3 or halfway through most of them I don't even care to watch any more. that in part is what makes stumbling across something like this so special but it does make one wonder how many other terrific little movies like this are out there that hardly anyone will ever see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect when watching this, I read the two sentences of info at the top of the IMDb page and thought 'meh, why not'.Turns out it's actually a great little film! A lot of people have described it as Shaun of the Dead meets Doctor Who, which I'd say is quite accurate, possibly with a little touch of Memento added (In a good way), but if you haven't seen it don't assume it to be exactly that. I found this film creative in a way that a lot of films lack, it's constantly going in a different direction, and skillfully giving you plenty to keep you guessing, but not enough to make it obvious as to what's going on. There are few films that actually draw me into the plot enough to actually make me want to guess how the film will end, which I think is part of what makes this film special. I doubt this film will ever go down in history as a work of notable artistic merit, because personally I wouldn't say it deserves that title, however if you want to watch a lighthearted film that's got a great plot, you'll love this. The kind of film you'd recommend your mates when it pops into your head down the pub, sort of like I'm recommending it to you now :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Title is spot on.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a slow silly start (men dressed up in animal costumes!), we nearly passed up on it. However we kept with it, and once the story got going we were glad we did. It is not a film with a profound message, but it is very entertaining and gives you things to think about if you like time loop puzzles. Wait for the chance meeting with the girl in the pub (or fast forward to it if you are watching a recording) before you decide, if at the beginning you find you don't like the film.All the classic problems with time travelled are explored in this film, some with fresh interpretations, so the film does do what it promises in the title. If you like Douglas Adam's view of the world in Hitchhiker's Guide or Grant/Naylor's view in Red Dwarf, then you should give this film a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Opening like a science fiction film with poor special effects we are introduced to protagonist Ray; it looks like he is about to lead an assault on some alien planet... in fact he is terrifying a group of children on a theme park ride! Not surprisingly he is given the sack. Later he goes to the pub with his friends Pete and Toby. Here strange things start to happen although Ray doesn't realise it at first; he is obsessed with time travel so when he bumps into Cassie, a woman claiming to be from the future, he naturally assumes his friends put her up to it. It becomes clear that something is really wrong when Pete returns from the toilet and finds himself in the future... a rather disturbing future where everybody in the pub, including a bearded version of himself, is dead! He retraces his steps and manages to get back to where his own time and tells the others... naturally they don't believe him so they all go to the toilets and repeat his actions; this time they end up half an hour in the past... He talks to Cassie again telling her that he believes her and she says she can fix the problem. Before the night is out they will travel to several different time periods, become globally famous, and confront somebody who is determined to kill them!.While this short low budget film is by no means a classic it is a lot of fun. It plays with the genre tropes without mocking them... the creators clearly know it will be science fiction fans that watch this so don't want to insult them! There are plenty of nods to other sci-fi films and stories that should give fans a knowing smile. Not all the laughs require knowledge of the genre... you don't need to be a sci-fi buff to laugh as Peter sings 'Total Eclipse of the Heart' while going to the toilet! While it was obviously made on a low budget and the effects are a bit ropey it is still worth watching as the cast do a good job with the material and the story is actually quite good. If you just want a laugh this is well worth watching and if you are a science fiction fan wanting a laugh it would be a shame to miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very clever time travel movie MUST WATCH</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OWN WARNING: possible spoilers about time lines (but no real spoilers about the plot). This movie already has a lot of reviews, a lot of them give it a bad score which I do not understand. Let me elaborate on that some more.But first I will agree, it might not be the most funny movie. With this I mean it doesn't have an avalanche of silly jokes. But it is definitely British humor. And there are hilarious moments.Having said that, it IS a great movie. Especially if you are into time travel Sci-fi. I guess that is what put a lot of people off. You have to be able to keep track of the story. This movie has made a great effort to make sure everything fits. For instance, when they travel back in time, you will see their alternates in the background. Details like that make it a great movie in my opinion, because a lot of films can contain inconsistencies. And the maker of this film has made sure that it all fits together. If you watch this movie for a second time, these are great little details to pay attention to. They are definitely not obvious when you watch it for the first time, but you will notice them on you second viewing.All in all if you love time travel movies, this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I have to say watch it! If you like time travel and sci-fi - I mean ... imagineering (lol)Dialog was good, amazing camera play and a heck of a ride. Every actor was great in their role and Anna Ferris was a cherry on top. I like her.I don't know how to compliment this movie without giving it away; like the other reviewer said, it started off a tiny bit slow(still super funny), and I too decided to give it 5 more minutes, and sweet Jesus, I would have missed out on this gem of a movie! (if I hadn't) It's smart, funny and epic all rolled into one.I would have liked it if they had a few extra dollars and more screen time. But they pulled it all off famously as is. I would have given it a 10 if they used high end effects and let us follow them around and explore a bit more in the other ... 'areas' (trying not to spoil it).However, they might have been actually trying to pull off the b-movie kind of effect, and if that's the case, then 10 stars!This is the type of comedy I'd tune in for if it was a show, and it could be at least 3 seasons before burning out. Like the twist at the end, I'm sure there is always more to do in this 'kind of situation.' Sorry, now I'm just going on. Watch this movie! Watch it. Trust the high reviews and watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a lovely little movie. Amazing actors but I would preferred Ferrel's character less stereotype "blond". O'Dowd, Wootton and Kelly was really great even though the script made them in short moment seem to be bickering brainless protozoans. I love the story. In comparison to Steve Pink's "Hot Tub Time Machine" (2010) it was more action in the story than on the screen, which I found enjoyable. The time jump events might have been bit tricky to follow but they should be, what would be the point of creating a story around paradoxes if not? In general this is a good movie and I think even non SciFi fans with a taste for light British humor would like this movie. It is not a Hollywood production wish is not a negative thing when it comes to this one. No over amazing special effects but high quality set and props framed the story perfect. Gareth Carrivick had a good story to work with and a simple straight forward directing with good timing made this movie to a non stop enjoyment to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not All Questions Are Anwered But That Doesn't Seem To Matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given a refreshing title like 'Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel', I was expecting some entertainment on the lines of 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'. However, this movie just did not match up to expectation. It starts off well and the chat of the three friends in the bar felt a little overstretched. The initial time travelling sequences were quite funny until it became repetitive and tiring. While the story isn't exactly original, the references to other films and literature made me smile. Chris O'Dowd does a decent job while Marc Wootton and Dean Lennox Kelly are adequate. Anna Faris is sadly wasted. Her screen time is limited and she isn't given much to do but her presence is definitely charming. Meredith MacNeill springs a surprise as the time machine villainess and she is laugh-out-loud funny. The visual effects are impressive and the cinematography is excellent. It's not a classic but a decent enough watch for one-time viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understated elegance, charm &amp; wit ensure this is worth a second look.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel is an engaging tongue-in-cheek romp through the titular Sci-Fi genre. The theatrical style &amp; sarcastic, dark, absurd, often self-denigrating humour is typically British; combined with the deliberately minimal use of special effects &amp; computer generated images this will undoubtedly put off those who prefer garish spectacle &amp; canned laughter over solid content &amp; narrative.The premise of three average everyday friends accidentally &amp; unwittingly caught up in a fantastical series of events beyond their control is intelligently dealt with, &amp; competently realized. Subtlety in both narrative &amp; performance adds hugely to the overall enjoyment, as does the fastidious attention to detail. The latter aspect is of course vital in tackling a subject so rich in paradox, &amp; is dealt with so elegantly that it's necessary for the narrative to explain to the audience when &amp; where it's been done.All in all an intelligent &amp; refreshingly novel film whose strengths some of the audience might miss due to it's modest &amp; unpretentious presentation.

		<fullReview>If you are sick or format movies with no stimulation for your thoughts and predictable outcomes then watch this film. It is highly entertaining, thought provoking, witty, well acted, well scripted, nicely produced and generally an all round great film. I had no idea what was going to happen next and I found the characters are very likable. The whole film is well thought out and entertaining and doesn't rely on special effect, over the top stunts, sexy costumes or other cheap shots to keep your gripped. The whole film is set inside a pub which keeps the feel very friendly, warm and cosy, but the pub changes (!) and this in itself is interesting and makes it very entertaining for the plot to stay in one place. It is a very British film with British humour and is enriched if you have an understanding of British pub culture/characters. I generally don't watch films more than once but I would be very happy to watch this again and I hope (probably in vain) that there will be a sequel.</fullReview>

I don't know why any non British were present in a British set drama but there presence came across as token, perhaps placed to get an American market and then the whole slippery slop of dumbing down the content raises its ugly head. This could have been more edgy, and I've just guessed why it wasn't.Chris O'Dowd plays himself, again, but luckily he's always worth a watch.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and Fresh Time Travel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays it's pretty hard to develop a quality and intriguing time travel movie with all the plots and variations that have been produced over time. Yet it seems that screenwriter Jamie Mathieson has succeeded to putting together a series of scenes that seems to extend the time paradox into an even more entertaining and captivating experience. This mostly light and humorous look at the mind twisting concept almost succeeds in its depiction of time travel. The only flaw perhaps is its slow pacing at the beginning and set up along with a somehow a lagging moments during the movie. Yet the superb use of new and freshly shot material and comic dialogue that comes just at the right movies really puts a bright shine over almost the entire movie. Well worth taking a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low budget fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ignoring Anna Faris' part in 'Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel' it's basically fair to say that the film was made with no major stars and even less of a budget. To claim that it's predictable may be a little unfair, but it probably won't surprise you too much. But that's not to say that it's not worth watching.Three British losers go to the pub and inadvertently get stuck in a time loop that will ? no doubt ? destroy life on the planet unless it's fixed. And, if you've seen the front cover, you may have read the tagline 'Shaun of the Dead meets Dr Who.' Yes, that's about it. I could almost leave the review there. That's pretty much all you need to know about it. It has the 'low budget' feel of an old (yes, not even the recent post-Christopher Eccelston) Dr Who interwoven with the lovable rogue kind of lads we rooted for in Shaun's zombie rom-com.In short, it relies on script over anything else. And the script isn't that bad. I've watched it twice now and, although nothing in it really made me laugh for a long time, there are enough chuckles in the banter between the three guys to make it worth watching. Plus if you're a fellow nerd (that's me, too ? although the film points out that the 'n-word' is a way of keep us 'imagineers' down!) you'll probably get the multiple references to numerous science fiction films (Aliens and Flash Gordon being the two most notably ones).The acting is what you'd expect from three likable losers, although the 'love plot' when Anna Faris comes into it seems a little forced.Overall, if you like sci-fi, if you like script-driven humour over special effects and are forgiving on the 'made-for-TV' feel to the movie, then give it a go. It's the definition of 'cheap and cheerful' and it should just raise enough smiles to make it worth your while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Pleasant Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason I started watching this film was because of Chris O'Dowd, whom I'd seen before in Bridesmaids and Moon Boy, which I loved: but since I'd never heard of it, I thought it probably wouldn't be very good. This little picture definitely invites Shaun of the Dead comparisons. It's a romantic comedy set mostly in a British pub with SF/horror/fantasy elements. After being introduced to our three main characters, O'Dowd's Ray has a "meet cute" when he's on his way back from the bar with another round for himself and his mates when Anna Faris introduces herself as a time traveler. Unlike most time travel films, this one tries very hard to adhere to it's own logic. I did find one plot hole that still nags me (if Pete went back in time so far that he was on primordial Earth before the time-traveling loo had even been built yet, then how'd he get back into the same time frame as his buddies?) This doesn't ruin the film, but the briefest of explanations could have sewn up this plot hole in just a few seconds. Even non geeks can find this film fun and entertaining. If you're in a Shaun of the Dead mood, but your viewing partner is as gore- averse as my wife, this is a great alternative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I reckon at one point Nick Frost and Simon Pegg were considered for the lead roles with Edgar Wright mooted as a director.However the film starts as three guys in a pub talking about time travel when one of them is fired from his job. Ray (Chris O'Dowd), Toby (Marc Wootton) and Pete (Dean Lennox Kelly) are out in the pub going through beers, crisps and moaning about life as well as talking science fiction but strangely no mention of Doctor Who.A trip to the toilet for one of them leads to some sort of time leak where the trio go back and forth along a time-line that could lead to danger. Anna Faris plays Cassie a woman from the future whose job is to repair these time leaks.The film is rather fun, the three leads play well together, they are not irritating and there is a mixture of comedy with some danger and drama. Faris mixes well with the trio and there is some substance with the science fiction elements of the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FAQ About Time Travel has that unique charm of a very low-budget film made by people truly committed to the subject matter. It's obvious that this is not a studio-conceived film made to cash in on current trends or appeal to a wide audience; this is a film made by nerds for nerds - or "imagineers". In contrast to the hit show "The Big Bang Theory" which is devoted to portraying fans of science fiction and science enthusiasts as socially inept, borderline autistic, insufferable jerks, for the entertainment of the general public, FAQ presents these people in a much more realistic and affectionate light, and the film is really enjoyable for anyone who has been called a nerd by society. It shoots references to science fiction film and literature, twisting and playing with ideas explored in the genre many times before, and so its appeal is probably limited to fans of the genre, but for them it's highly recommended.</fullReview>

While at the pub he meets a rather unusual girl who claims to be from the future, of coarse he thinks she is either crazy or pranking him. Soon after he finds himself caught up in a chain of events leaving him and his friends on a journey trying to get back to their own time.I was pretty surprised that it was never released in the USA, other than on HBO.

Also, the time flew watching it, so you probably won't get bored either.There were some really lame jokes and the final ending was a bit boring, that's why I'm giving it only 7, as more would be over-rated and less would be under-rated.I will definitely watch it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's always time for one more quick drink in the pub.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three blokes walk into a pub, it's the start of many good gags and also the start of some time-travel japery in this British sci-fi comedy that, unfortunately, falls a little short of actual laughs.Starring a few faces familiar to fans of UK comedy (Chris O'Dowd, Mark Wootton and Dean Lennox Kelly) plus that gal from Scary Movie (Anna Faris, who I often enjoy on screen so have no qualms with her being in this film at all), this movie sees a couple of nerds (or, as they prefer to be called, imagineers) and their mate desperate to get back to their own time and have everything fixed after they travel through a time leak that has appeared, yep, in the pub toilets. Cue characters avoiding other versions of themselves, discussions of paradoxes and how to avoid them and plenty of twisted logic/things known that need to happen in the past shenanigans. Yes, I like the word shenanigans.While this is a harmless and enjoyable little film, I must say that I wanted more from it. At it's best it comes close to some of the great, time-travelling story lines used in the magnificent "Red Dwarf" but at it's worst it's just flat and a little bit too much like listening to a long, long joke that has an ultimately disappointing punchline.The cast all do very well in their roles (and I should also mention Meredith MacNeill, who gives a very entertaining turn) but they're really not served that well by a script that could, and should, have been so much more.Director Gareth Carrivick doesn't embarrass himself but certainly never strays too far from his TV background, which is fine in terms of the budget and scope he is able to provide but not so good in terms of actual creativity and comedy beats (although Jamie Mathieson's script may be to blame there, despite its tight construction it's really more time-travel than laughs which makes for a little bit less fun).If you like the cast and you like your time-travel japery then this movie should keep you pleased. It's nothing special though, which is a shame as I was hoping for a little bit more.See this if you like: "Red Dwarf", "The IT Crowd", Back To The Future Part II.</fullReview>

The filmmakers shouls have made a funnier time travel movie. The jokes more often than not fall flat. The movie kept me wanting to find out how the story was going to wrap up. Unfornutately, it didn't come togeather as well as I hoped. The ending wasn't satisfying enough and should have borough more closure. Even though this isn't what I would call a good movie, it is barely passable.funnier time travel movie. The jokes more often than not fall flat.

Showing up out of nowhere sporatically throughout the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't get enough of boring sitcom stereotypes and harmless, "charming" humor? You'll love this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite throwing around heady concepts (chaos theory, which is essentially defined as "the law of unintended consequences") and big words ("anachronistically"), this movie is actually quite short on either science or science fiction. It's basically just a light-hearted fantasy-comedy aimed at nerds (excuse me -- make that "people on the autistic spectrum"). In fact, the ridiculous pandering to their audience was a bit of a turn-off to me. There were so many homages and outright, explicit pop culture references that I found the whole thing rather tedious. I seem to be in the extreme minority here, as most people found that to be one of the best parts of the movie. Strangely, the most common complaints -- that of the acting and budget -- didn't bother me at all. I'm honestly not sure what these people are complaining about, because, to me, neither seemed to be nearly so annoying as the script. The directing was a little bit uneven, with the pacing being a bit slow and ponderous in the first half (which is where most of the problems with the film lie, in my opinion), while the second half is actually quite a bit better, with some semblance of story starting to take shape. And then it ends. Boom. I was like, "Wait, that's it? That's all? It was just starting to get good, and they end it?" I was left feeling rather unfulfilled, like there was only 15-20 minutes of actual good content, plus a whole bunch of filler (constant, unending homages, frequent film references, running gags, and revisiting the same scene several times, from slightly different points of view). In the end, this could have made a really good YouTube video or short film, if stripped of some of the more tedious elements. Or they could have actually made a compelling film, instead of constantly referencing their favorite movies...Harsh? Perhaps so, but I'm not feeling particularly forgiving today. Despite that, I still give it a 6/10, because the second half of the movie really does make up for a lot of the tediousness of the first half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three disaffected thirtyish men go for a drink in a pub and have a night to remember. After one of them has a chance meeting with a strange girl and another has a mind-bending experience on using the toilet, all three find they have travelled in time and inadvertently changed the future? The film borrows freely from science fiction films, TV and fiction (The Terminator, Doctor Who and Ray Bradbury's story A Sound of Thunder are among its more obvious influences). The premise is unusual for a comedy and the start of the film seems promising but, after its first half hour, it quickly becomes tedious. I laughed only once or twice in the whole film.The characters are just not as endearing as they're meant to be and the plot meanders, lacking the excitement of The Terminator and the appeal of Doctor Who. The writer seems uncertain of where to take the story and throws in various gimmicks which seem to go nowhere. I just didn't find it a satisfying story. In any science fiction or fantasy story, "suspension of disbelief" is vital, but the storyline for me just wasn't credible.After some impressive effects in the opening scene, the rest of the film's relatively few special effects look cheap and feel as if they don't quite belong to the same film. Despite its short running time, it seemed quite long to me - never a good feeling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Throw away,. waste of time.. travel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Utter tosh.A poor sci-fi comedy which is totally unbelievable with the emphasis on the fiction rather that the science. The acting is poor, the dialogue is unnatural and ridiculous, it meant to be humorous and it's just not. A lot of the plot seems like is was written by a schoolboy with zero coherence. I get the feeling it was attempting to emulate the success of 'Shaun Of The Dead' but it is 3rd rate in every way. Do not bother to find out how bad this film is. Don't know who was funding this film, had a BBC ident at the beginning and I hope that none of my licence fee went towards making this excuse for a film. Why do IMDb reviews have to be so long I've not got the time to write long reviews, just want to discourage people from watching this terrible film. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wish i could travel back in time and get my 70mins back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got this movie based on the good rating here on IMDb.What followed was one of the worst 70 minutes of my life. How someone can rate this flick 7, 8 or 9 is beyond me.This movie is basically 70mins of three pretty dumb brits talking about time travel paradoxes, with the majority of the movie playing in the pub plus a few outside shots.This movie seems like a ultra-low budget movie which FAILS in many aspects.) It is not funny at all. I got this assuming it is a "witty" comedy. Maybe i just don't understand British humor (excuse me: "humoUr"), but there was really nothing funny about it, except you think that three nerdish brits (British nerds?) in a pub talking about time travel is a funny thing.) Needless to say it didn't satisfy in the "Science Fiction" area either...and FAR from "keeps you on the edge of your seat". For crying out lout, what about that movie keeps you on the edge of your seat? I started twitching about 40mins into the movie with a strong desire to turn it off and watch something else. Sadly, i watched it all the way through.The best thing is, when you actually think that the movie might become interesting..it is OVER. It is over after a "staggering" short 70mins.I give this movie a 3 for "good attempt" and "odd British humour weirdness"...but i am still trying to find that time-rift in my own bathroom, to go and get my wasted time back.Don't get me wrong, i love British humour, there is lots out there which is great...but this one was just a really, really DUMB movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was this supposed to be funny?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am totally baffled as to the IMDb numbers for this film. It has &gt;1000 votes and only 7 user reviews, all ranging from 7 to 9 stars, AND a 7.5 rating? Now here are some interesting question about FAQATT: Are people who have rated this so high blind? Or have the makers of this movie get all their relatives and friends to vote favorably for it? OK let me be the first one to warn you about this poor poor British attempt at an entertaining movie: Acting was unbelievably weak, even for a sitcom which this is most reminiscent of. Watching the 3 main leads interact and utter their lines from the script I couldn't help but cringe with each and every poorly-shot scene. I was hoping it'd get better as the plot might eventually evolve but it really was the same thing through the film.I love Chris O'Dowd and his IT Crowd character but here he was just a shadow of his former self, having a bad hair day on top of all.Story was abysmal and plodding, script was EXTREMELY unfunny - save for the only moment when the 3 characters do the toilet dance thing which I found quite hilarious - and the production values non-existent. 85% of the film we see just a sub-sitcom level dialog, meaning the 3(+1) actors trying to make us believe they are having a good time being in this movie, which they obviously did not, thanks to the inexperienced director and screenwriter.Worst film of 2009? Quite possibly yes.1/10</fullReview>
