		<shortDescription>Excellent portrayal of actual events</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard did a wonderful job of bringing some of the real-life problems that firefighters face everyday in Backdraft. I'm kind of tired of hearing the Monday morning quarterbacks on this site trying to talk about how bad it was and that it wasn't realistic, etc. Take it from a REAL firefighter who has lost brothers in REAL fires and has lived through a REAL backdraft, it's NOT all fun and games, and it's far from glamourous. This movie did an excellent job capturing some of the emotions that flow through every firehouse in America today, particularly after 9/11, we are a brotherhood in which the "I go---we go" mentality is a very REAL concept that most of us live by everyday. And the corruption part of the story, well that's Hollywood for ya, if it doesn't have death, destruction, and corruption...then it doesn't sell very well. Yes there are corrupt politicians and it wouldn't surprise me if things like that did happen, but it's far from commonplace and was just to enhance the film and give you a person to "hate" in the film (JT Walsh, God rest his soul).So I give it 4 out of 4 stars, very realistic, well directed, EXCELLENT acting on Kurt Russell and Robert DiNiro's parts, and can't wait til I find it on DVD to buy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of Ron Howard's better films. Much of the filming was done on location in Chicago. Acting was excellent. Especially by Kurt Russell and William Baldwin. I have heard a lot of negatives about this movie, but I still feel it is worth a 9 at least. Steven and Brian McCaffery's dad (also a fireman) was killed in a fire in 1971. Brian was just a youngster, and along for the ride with his dad when he was killed. Twenty years later, Brian has become a fireman after failing at other pursuits. Steven is a lieutenant with the Chicago Fire Department. Steven does not think Brian can cut the mustard as a fireman, and Brian is out to prove himself. It makes for a great sibling rivalry. On top of this, an arsonist is setting fires, and the arson investigator, Donald Rimgale (Robert DeNero) does not have a clue as to who it is. Rimgale is pressured by an egotistical alderman (J.T. Walsh) who wants to be mayor. Brian has his problems working with Steven, and finally gives up, and accepts a job working with Rimgale. They find the links between all the fires, but Brian finds out more. (who the arsonist is). The climactic scene in chemical warehouse is great! I was told by someone that the funeral scene was overdone. I don't think so...I have seen funerals for firemen and they look exactly like what you see in the movie...Universal Studios in Hollywood had a Backdraft set on their lot some years back (which I visited), and it gives you a chance to see what these actors really faced...This is without a doubt one of my favorite movies, and Ron Howard deserves his share of kudos for an excellent directing job</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Howard's film is solid, better than you think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard's action/thriller about two brothers (Baldwin and Russell), who have some differences but need to work together to find out whose causing recent arson fires in their district. THe film is done well, good acting for the most part, brilliant direction, and a decent screenplay. I thought William Baldwin started out the first couple scenes with a bit of a constant smirk on his face, but his acting seemed to improve (or maybe grow on me), he gave a satisfying performance. Meanwhile Russell was solid as well as his older brother who is an old-fashioned bitter fireman who takes too many risks. The female performances were rather average, Jennifer Jason Leigh was decent as Jennifer a girl who helps Brian (Baldwin). Rebecca DeMornay is not so great as Steven (Russel)'s ex-wife. Robert DeNiro was great in his role as a fire department detective trying to solve the case. J.T. Walsh was also decent in his role, which was similar but expanded in F. Gary Gray's THe Negotiator. The best performance of the film came from Scott Glenn who was great as a firefighter known as "Axe". I haven't seen Ladder49, so this is my favorite firefighter movie as of now. The script had some problems, as it didn't flow well, but the actors managed to save it although i was particularly upset with one dialogue between jennifer jason leigh and william baldwin which seemed like a complete rip-off of the scene where Michael Corleone and Kay see each other again after Michael is back from Sicily in Godfather part 1. But for the most part the script was average, not bad, but saved by brilliant direction, solid acting and great action. The music was done very well and suited the film, props to Hans Zimmer for yet another great score. The cinematography was also very good, especially in the fire scenes, good job by Mikael Salomon. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's weird to think that when I went to see "Home Alone" in the theaters, "Backdraft" was advertised right before the movie came on. The whole thing is a little grimmer than we usually expect from Ron Howard. It focuses on mutually hostile brothers Stephen (Kurt Russell) and Brian McCaffrey (William Baldwin), both firefighters in Chicago having to put aside their differences to fight an arson outbreak.True, it doesn't really sound like much of a plot, but Howard knows how to keep everything going. Stephen is the sort of guy with a bad attitude whom you can't help but respect. Brian mainly shows that there was once a time when Alec Baldwin's brothers could act. As for the climax, that is really something that is likely to shock you royally. But don't get me wrong. This is a good movie. Maybe not any kind of masterpiece, but worth seeing nevertheless. Above all, it's not a disaster movie (the less said about "The Towering Inferno" the better). Also starring Robert DeNiro, Donald Sutherland, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Scott Glenn, Rebecca DeMornay and J.T. Walsh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Backdraft, proves once again, that Ron Howard is one of Hollywood's major contenders. This time around he explores fire through technical wizardry.The movie itself is a tad bit overdone, story wise, but the effects are absolutely astonishing. And the acting, by mostly everyone is fabulous. It takes a lot to outdo Robert De Niro, but Kurt Russell manages to do so, especially in the end sequence. And even better, William Baldwin shows he can act.Rating = 8 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Backdraft Forever Burns in my Memory!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Backdraft" is one of those movies that stays on your mind after you've seen it. It is just so amazingly shot, and the story takes you in. When I first saw this movie, maybe five years ago, I thought the fire sequences were extremely realistic, and I still do. I thought that Ron Howard did an excellent job directing this film, and the cast was superb.The story is about two feuding brothers, Stephen and Brian McCaffrey, both of who are part of the Chicago Fire Department. The story covers the reason behind the McCaffrey's feud, the hardships and adventures of a firefighter's life, and the consequences of the phenomenon known as a "backdraft". Someone is also murdering people and covering their deaths with this phenomenon. The McCaffrey's discover that they have to work together to solve this unsolvable mystery.I thought that Kurt Russel was perfect as Stephen McCaffrey, because he provided the toughness and grit necessary for the role. And William Baldwin was perfect as Brian, the McCaffrey brother who is still searching for his place in the world, and trying to fit into the role that both his father once played and that his brother Stephen is now playing. Scott Glenn is also perfectly cast as Axe.The film perfectly shows the life of a fireman- the hardships, the pains and the glory. It also shows that two people can put aside their differences for the greater good. I strongly recommend Backdraft to everyone. It is a very powerful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Backdraft A Movie Definitely Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Backdraft is a movie definitely worth watching from famous director Ron Howard who continues to show his skill as a filmmaker with this one. Kurt Russell, William Baldwin, Scott Glenn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Rebecca De Mornay, and Robert De Niro are great in the movie bringing to life these believable characters we see on the screen. The rest of the cast are admirable in their small roles including J.T. Walsh, Jason Gedrick, and Donald Sutherland. Its better to watch this movie without knowing too much about it because if you do than you're going to be in for a heck of a movie experience. The film tells story of two brothers (Russell and Baldwin) in the fire department whose bond is tested as mysterious murders begin to occur by a dangerous arsonist on the loose. Backdraft is an excellent story about fire fighters with realistic action for the most part, suspense, some humor, and a little romance that make for an enjoyable movie to watch. The film did seem to drag a little near the end but its one flaw so the good more than outweighs the bad. If you're looking for an entertaining movie to watch that's worth your time and money then see Backdraft. You can't go wrong with this film. It's definitely one of Ron Howards best movies on par with Apollo 13 and A Beautitful Mind. It's really that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fire. A living, breathing animal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you watch this movie, you'll never look at fire the same way again. In 'Backdraft', fire is portrayed as a vicious animal that breathes and devours. The story revolves around an arson investigation in the city of Chicago where a sibling rivalry is flaring as well between Brian and Stephen McCaffrey. You'll be blown away by Industrial Light &amp; Magic's special effects and Hans Zimmer's dramatic score. Ron Howard put together an incredible, thrill-ride movie with action, drama and romance all rolled in. Do not miss this movie and don't turn your back on a fire, it knows when to strike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thin story, but diffucult to dislike.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie many times noe, and I can understand that many people slam this film for being corny and unrealistic. And they are right, it is corny, but it is acted and directed with conviction, that it is hard for me not to like it. The core of the movie the story of 2 feuding firefighter brothers played by Kurt Russell and Adam Baldwin. This part of the story may be cliched, but the 2 actors do a good job in their roles, especially Russell, he plays the elder brother, trying to protect his screwup younger brother from the dangers of firefighting. The other parts are less successful, there is a subplot involving the wife of Russell's wife inabilty to deal with his risk taking in his job, Rebecca DeMornay does what she can with a small role. The other subplot of the story is the one that doesn't work, it involves the murders of financial experts hire by a city alderman to close down firestations for financial gain. This part of the story should have been scrapped, it just chops up screen time and is never compelling. That leaves the action scenes, they are spectacular. The fire scenes keep you on the edge of your seat. The special effects are great, but even though the script is corny the actors made me care enough for what was happening to them. It is directed by Ron Howard, who usually is more successful in the human side of the story, he seems to have spent more time on the technical side of the story than the human side. Too bad, even though I like this film, it misses greatness due to a weak script.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This work features some great, entertaining and witty banter by Kurt Russell, the hot dog firefighter, willing to risk it all for the people of his city. Okay, maybe that was a little overstated, but it's still accurate.I like this movie at least as well as the first couple of Lethal Weapon movies. When there's action, it's awesome; when there's witty repartee, it's witty; and when there's drama, it's dramatic. The performances here are top notch, and the plot is intriguing, holding your attention throughout.Hats off to the Cowboys! Ron Howard's direction is inspired, the effects are awesome, and the performances are legendary.I was nothing, if not entertained.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is poor representation of modern firefighting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was going in, thinking it would be a awesome film, but I got burn. It's no way realistic. I know it's Hollywood so there going to take some liberties, but this movie has a ridiculous portrayal of firefighters. These firefighters are so terribly trained that they don't even know how to don their gear correctly. When Stephen "Bull" McCaffrey (Kurt Russell) goes into the 2 story building, to rescue the child from a fire, he has his coat wide open and no SCBA equipment. The smoke would have killed him in a matter of seconds as his lungs would be seared by the heat. If anybody was to run into a fire filled room with their coat undone they'd be cooked like a goose! Most of the characters would have died within the first 30 seconds of the film from having seared lungs, smoke inhalation, or extreme burns. I like how the fire can explode right in their face, and they don't end up getting first or second degree burns. The amount of smoke that was in the fires if real life would have been blinding, not clear. By the way, what type of firefighters smoke cigarettes while cleaning up a burned out building after breathing in tons of smoke? I would be afraid to light up in a building that might have gases in it because it might start a fire, again.As for the title of the film, 'Backdraft'. It's very incredibly rare behavior of fire. Even if you were the evil genius arsonist setting these backdraft, you would need to spend days creating just the right environment where a back-draft can occur. It's a easy task. Honestly the idea that an arsonist is creating backdrafts to kill certain individuals is preposterous to begin with. I'm not a firefighter and I know that it would be nearly impossible to do that, and it would certainly be impossible to do it to the extent that the arsonist does here. The movie plot is suppose to just that. Firefighters trying to catch the arsonist, but screenwriter Gregory Widen shovels one subplot on top of another, and it becomes too much. There is the sub-plot about two brothers, Stephen McCaffrey and Brian McCaffrey (William Baldwin) having a love and hate relationship, with Brian living under the shadow of his heroic brother, and father. The movie is very clichés with the firefighter heroics such in the case it becomes unrealistic. The first shot of Kurt Russell's Stephen is him walking out a burning building in a manly pose. This is follow up with a heroic slow moment of him rescuing a kid. It's so cheesy. Even the opening scene is over the top, with the firefighters taking a child with them to fight fires. Who is going to babysit the kid while you are fighting fires? Is taking a child to a fire zone kinda dangerous? Director Ron Howard seeks to wring tears from the audience by having a fireman's helmet incredibly bounce out of a second story window in front of the kid and everybody slow motion moves around is just poetic stupid. The worst is the silly montage of Brian training under his brother with dripping his head in water as if a male model. Another subplot of the film is Stephen trying to get back with his estranged wife, Helen McCaffrey (Rebecca De Mornay) which doesn't play no factor into the main plot. No, honestly, it's doesn't play into anything. It's just waste screen time, that could have better been focus on finding the arsonists. The best scenes in the film are that of Brian teaming up with Donald "Shadow" Rimgale (Robert de Niro) a dedicated arson investigator looking for the backdraft killer. They even get help from Arsonist 'Silent of the Lambs' what a be Hannibal Lector, Ronald Bartel (Donald Sutherland). Donald Sutherland is pretty creepy in his role. "A fire eats and breathes and hates." He quotes. Sorry, but fires don't hate; only people hate, Ronald. Firs is not a living entity, film. Robert de Niro is great in his role, and get closer to closer to finding the murderer. Too bad, Brian is rarely any help. Brian barely does anything in the film for the main character, but gets in the way of better supporting characters. Rather than finding the killer, he is having sex with Jennifer Vaitkus (Jennifer Jason Leigh) Brian's ex-girlfriend and works for the city alderman who trying to cut back the fireman department budget. Her loyalties are torn between her job and Brian. I think making love on top of a speeding fire truck will get you fired in real life.William Baldwin is no Alec. His performance was horrible. The way he played puppy dog in an attempt to convey depression and self-pity, it was eye-rolling bad. Baldwin's role was originally written for Tom Cruise, who would have given the movie some much-needed star power. He is disappointing. The film tries way too hard to be cool instead of realistic, which is a shame considering that a film about firefighters and arson could have been wholly intriguing while remaining believable, had it been attempted properly. Instead, this film feels so fake with the over the top action sequences. The factory argument in particular is awful. Rather than putting out the fire, they waste their time arguing while the building is burning around him. Don't get me wrong, the action scenes are impressive, and the special effects are still rather extraordinary, but it's scenes like that, that makes me cringe. Han Zimmer's score is amazing in my opinion. The best thing to come out of this movie is Backdraft fire special effects show at Unversial Studios Hollywood, and that's not saying much. It closed down in 2010 after 19 years worth of shows. Overall: watch it if bored, but don't think too much into it. It's just a pointless popcorn flick</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fantastic fire fighting film, that's really moving, and emotional, with brilliant effects, and outstanding performances!. All the characters are fantastic, and the story is really excellent, plus Kurt Russell, William Baldwin and Robert De Niro are all simply amazing in this!. It really is quite a powerful film in my opinion, as I didn't find it cheesy at all, and the ending while excellent is extremely sad, plus Russell and William Baldwin had wonderful chemistry together. Donald Sutherland has a really creepy role in this, and while it has a couple predictable moments, it surprisingly was able to keep me guessing for the most part, plus it's extremely well made and pretty well written as well. The Fire effects really blew me away(especially in the finale), and The opening is also quite sad, plus you are able to care for the two brothers (Russell and Baldwin), because you can tell they have had some problems with each other, and have gone through rough times.One of my favorite funny moments in this film is when Baldwin (Brian) and Jennifer Jason Leigh (Jen) are making out at the top of the fire truck, and then the fire team squad have to go stop a fire, as I thought that was quite amusing, and there is lots of suspense as well, plus I think this should be a lot higher then 6.6 in my opinion. Some scenes were incredibly tense, and if you wanted to be a fireman someday, then you most definitely should see this movie, plus I thought it was cool how Russell played 2 roles as the dad(in the opening) and the brother Stephen!. I was actually really surprised how good the story was, as I as expecting a cheesy B type one, and it has one of the finest casts ever, plus I wish they gave De Niro more screen time because he had an awesome character. I would go as far to say that this is a minor classic, and the person who was committing those fire's may not be as easy to guess as you think, as I didn't expect it to be that person at all, plus it had a very good score as well. This is a fantastic fire fighting film, that's really moving, and emotional, with brilliant effects, and outstanding performances, and I say go see it now!.The Direction is fantastic!. Ron Howard does a fantastic! job here, with brilliant camera work, incredible angles, adding some good atmosphere, and did lots of other awesome shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace.The Acting is outstanding!. Kurt Russell is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, funny, had wonderful chemistry with William Baldwin, had an awesome character, and I felt for him in a lot of scenes, he also had some awesome emotional scenes with Baldwin, as usual brought a lot of charisma, and did a lot of courageous stuff, I adored his performance! (Russell Rules!!!!!!!). William Baldwin is also amazing here as Russell's younger brother Brain, he was extremely likable, vulnerable, and had a haunted past, as you will be rooting for him, he is the only Baldwin I like out of the bunch, as I was really surprised by how amazing he was here!. Robert De Niro is also amazing as always and is amazing here, he had a rough&amp;gruff character but was a nice guy actually, he brought his usual intensity, and had a great character, I just wish they gave him more screen time cause he is one of the best ever, he also had some great scenes with Baldwin (De Niro Rules!!!!!!!). Donald Sutherland is really creepy in his role, and he was able to pull it off perfectly as it was a somewhat difficult role I Imagine, he was awesome. Jennifer Jason Leigh is beautiful and does what she has to do very well, which unfortunately wasn't much, I wish they gave her more screen time. Scott Glenn is great as Axe, he was intense, I quite liked him, he was especially good near the end. Rebecca De Mornay is beautiful, and does fine in her role, and had some good scenes with Russell, however not enough screen time. Jason Gedrick is very good as the rookie Tim I liked him. J.T. Walsh is excellent as the sleaze ball Mayor I hated him. Rest of the cast are fine.Overall go see it now!. ***** out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen this for a long time, but was stunned how great this move really is, when seeing it again on DVD.It's one of the few exceptions when u don't need any bullets to create a breathtaking action film.Kurt Russel gives one of the best performances of his long and outstanding career. I never expected his character to die in the end (I was really sad when watching this one for the first time), but that's what gives this film his quality, like GLADIATOR or ROAD TO PERDITION. A real hero has to die in the end.As I remember this was also the first big score for Hans Zimmer (now famous for THE LION KING and GLADIATOR) which defined his style for the years to come.BACKDRAFT does the same to firefighters as TOP GUN did for fighter-pilots: U want to be one of them! ;o) Great film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The other day I showed my boyfriend a great movie, Stand By Me, a movie I have shown to many people and they absolutely adored it, but for some odd reason he didn't like it. He lends me a movie called Backdraft and he tells me that he's shown it to many people and they loved it, instead I hated this movie. I don't think I've hated a movie so much in a while, how this movie has even a 6.6 rating is beyond me. I couldn't keep up with the five million stories here: Billy Baldwin becoming a fire man, the random sibling rivalry, the random love story(s), the who's being an arson story, the investigator, the fire who has a personality of it's own. I just have a problem that this movie can't keep up with all these stories, they didn't balance out well enough make the film interesting. I would have just preferred if this movie was about being a firefighter or the investigator and how he came to be one or what it is exactly he does and why.The movie tells the story of a group of Chicago firefighters, two brothers. Stephen "Bull" McCaffrey, the elder brother, is obsessed with the beating of the fires that he fights. Brian, the younger brother quit the fire fighting academy school several years before, then embarking on a number of other unsuccessful careers before returning to become a firefighter. He is looked down on by his elder brother who expects him to fail in his newly chosen career as a fire fighter. Donald "Shadow" Rimgale is an arson investigator who is dedicated to his profession. He is called in because a number of fires that have occurred have somewhat similar connections. .Martin Swayzak is an alderman on the City Council. He has obvious hopes of being elected to mayor, but has had to make a number of budget cuts to the fire department. Many of the rank and file firemen believe that the cuts that he has made are endangering the lives of the firefighters. However, Swayzak is initially successful in portraying the fire department as bloated and ineffectual after firemen are repeatedly being killed in blazes.I just couldn't get into this movie, I don't know how anyone else could, it was incredibly unrealistic and portrayed firefighters all wrong. I loved how they had every action cliché in the book to match this action flick. I just felt also like there was great talent wasted on such mediocre roles, Donald Sutherland, great actor, but such a strange role that could have been taken by a lesser known man who had the upcoming talent at the time. I know Ron was going for great quality, but I think him casting such huge actors in small roles was a mistake for this film. I even had to joke my way through while watching this movie commenting how the doctor in the background was probably Kevin Spacey. The fire was so unrealistic and the movie was just so out there, I didn't enjoy it and honestly wouldn't recommend it to people, I'll stick to the recommendations in my relationship from this point on.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is more then enough cop, lawyer and doctor movies and shows but this movie and Rescue Me as a TV show are the best representations of what it's like to be a firefighter and what they do for a living. Going into burning buildings and bringing people out. Ron Howard really gets his actors in there with the fire it's not them in unrealistic fires where they're not even close to the flames, very well done by the effects team.The story is about a pair of brothers whose dad was also a fireman. Kurt Russell plays the father and also the older brother Stephen who's a veteran firefighter and now a Lieutenant while William Baldwin plays the younger brother Brian who after bouncing around from job to job finally decided to get into the family business and is now a probationary at firefighter as part of Stephen's fire company.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Firefighting Legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Backdraft got Oscar nominations for Best Sound and best visual and audio effects what drives this Ron Howard film is the performances he got from Kurt Russell and Billy Baldwin as the firefighting McCaffrey brothers. The brothers have a lot of distance in their ages as Russell practically raised McCaffrey after their firefighter father was killed on the job. Baldwin realizes he has a big legacy with the Chicago Fire Department and he's hesitant about it. After some issues with Russell, Baldwin gets assigned to arson investigator Robert DeNiro.Which gets Baldwin involved in DeNiro's investigation of some strange arson fires that were set to Backdraft and cause homicides and there is a connection between three seemingly unrelated deaths.The fire effects were great and the location shooting in Chicago a definite plus. Backdraft is the kind of a film you just cannot make on a studio back-lot which 50 years ago it would have been. I'm surprised some Oscar nominations didn't come for either Russell or Baldwin. Their performances are so good you forget they're actors and you think you are watching firefighting drama.And Donald Sutherland's bit role as the Hannibal the Cannibal of arsonists is one you'll remember. He has two scenes, one with DeNiro at a parole hearing and later one with Baldwin as Baldwin seeks expert opinion on the arsonist's technique. In that scene Sutherland evokes Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter when FBI agent Jodie Foster seeks his expertise.And this review is dedicated to all the firefighters all over the world who take on that terribly important job to protect citizens from flame. After watching Backdraft you might get an insight into why the ancient cave people worshiped this phenomenon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fires should always come to mind when the word fire fighter is mentioned. But what do they really experience? How intense can the fires be? Watching Backdraft will not only answer those questions but it will also open your eyes to a new perspective. This is one hell of a film to see. Never have I seen action scenes so intense. Adding to the strong action sequences are the powerful performances by the lead actors. Kurt Russell and upcoming star William Baldwin play two brothers who argue repetitively due to their troubled childhood. This issue is established at the beginning of the film, which then sets the tone for the rest of the movie. What's even more amazing is how convincing these actors do this job. You actually look at the characters like they're real people and not just another actor on screen. The more you watch this movie, the more you will become convinced that they do fire fighting for a living. It's that believable. Co-starring with Baldwin and Russell are these well-known actors: Robert De Niro, Donald Sutherland, and Scott Glenn.So what is it about these action sequences? Well of course they're going to involve fires! But what makes these scenes work is how the fires are filmed. There are parts where you see flames creep along the floor in slow motion and there are other times where the fire fighters are engulfed by fire, that there's nothing else on screen. Some sound effects in the explosions are different and intriguing as well. You would almost think for split second, do raging fires really create that kind of sound?Even more profound, is the soundtrack in this movie. The film score was composed and conducted by Hans Zimmer. Right from the beginning of the film, he starts out with a song that brings such an honorable look at fire fighters and what they do. Along with its good cast and progression of bigger fire hazards, it really makes the movie all the more influential. It's so good, it may even inspire some viewers to join or volunteer their time to their local fire station/squad.Backed by powerful performances, big explosions and a moving soundtrack, Backdraft is the fire fighter movie to see before all others. It will also give the viewer a better appreciation for their local career and volunteer men and women.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly a great epic about the life of 2 brothers built around there lives as firemen. From great acting to terrific special affects showing how harrowing it is for these firemen who go in knowing that there lives are really at risk. The acting across the board is great. Russell was solid as ever. Baldwin gives a great performance as the younger brother. Glenn is fantastic as a firemen who goes to evil ways to prove the system of politics is corrupt. Have no idea why anyone would give this below an 8 for at rating. But I guess people are into lousy, stupid movies like Spiderman and the new Clash of the Titans. For people into serious movies about serious topics like firefighting will enjoy this classic from Ron Howard..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best watched a long time ago</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie when I was a teenager. LOVED it. It hasn't grown up with me, unfortunately. That may be because it's a melodramatic load of old rubbish full of macho posturing, cheesy dialogue, overwrought slow motion and characters saying 'Goddammit' a lot. The lumpy narrative switches gracelessly from one character to another, one plot strand to another, without ever bringing it all together, and it doesn't help that William Baldwin's mono-expression of a performance is stretched to breaking point over the movie's overlong running time. Robert DeNiro and Donald Sutherland are worth watching, I guess, but no one's really at the top of their game here and the female characters get particularly short thrift. The only real impact comes from the impressive firefighting sequences and in particular Hans Zimmer's majestic score, which remains one of my all-time favourites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am amazed by how low-rated this film is.Backdraft has suspense, action, and excellent acting by the Kurt Russell, Scott Glenn, DeNiro and Sutherland. The myriad relationship problems are realistic, as is the action (firefighters I know swear by this film). It is visually stunning, supported by a good score. Ron Howard's direction manages to cover the minor flaws and carry the story.It does demand a bit of attention to follow all the details, twists and turns in the plot, but this makes it more enjoyable when you see it the second or third time, e.g., Adcox (McCaffrey senior's peer) is the "young" firefighter that hugs little boy McCaffrey after his father dies. This same Adcox, approaching retirement, finds himself working for the older McCaffrey brother, and their relationship is key to the story.Unless you are thoroughly bored by detective movies, troubled relationships, and firefighting, this movie is well worth seeing, but you have to watch closely or see it more than once to appreciate how well crafted it is.I gave it 9 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll go on record here as saying that Kurt Russell is one of the least appreciated, least recognized forces in acting today. Having said that, for those viewers who remain unaware, Backdraft is his finest film. Not only did Ron Howard direct him perfectly, he surrounded him with a flawless supporting cast ... with the exception of Billy Baldwin. Stephen would have been the better Baldwin for this role, sorry.To set the scene, we have Chicago in the summertime, feuding brothers reunited, heroes walking a fine line, lost loves resurfacing and a vengeful arsonist destroying with motive. Even better, the heroes are real men, possibly the last of the greatest heroes: the firefighter.I've always considered Kurt Russell to be a modern day cowboy ... not like Sam Elliot, just the mystique. He can stand alone in the street and stare down what goes against the grain of his principles and never bat an eye. His entire world is crumbling around him and the one person who is spearheading the demise is the brother he can't understand.While DeNiro, Donald Sutherland and the late J.T. Walsh turn in superb performances, the real heart of the supporting cast lies in Rebecca DeMornay and Scott Glenn. Backdraft is a fantastic character piece, and absolutely a classic. I would have a hard time not naming this as one of the five greatest films ever made. *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good flick with mostly upside</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an exciting story of firefighting brothers who conduct their own search for a very proficient arsonist who is targeting a group of people. The reason they are targeted is obvious to any movie goer, but in real life would not be at all evident, so you sit back and watch people put clues together. The younger brother is the central and most likable character in the movie (by the process of elimination). It is very reminiscent of a Japanese kung fu movie in the story of the brothers. A lot of characters are very badly written in order to make points, but that's acceptable in film making if the point is important enough. Sutherland and De Niro play two of the badly written characters, and portray the stereotypes they play too often: Sutherland as a psycho, and DeNiro as a superman is on top of everything and probably never had to sneeze in his life. Both of these actors are much better than this, and it is disheartening to see them take on the same role every movie, especially when they have proved themselves to be excellent actors in their early movies (Sutherland in THE DIRTY DOZEN, De Niro in BRAZIL, THE MISSION, and ONCE UPON A TIME IN America). Here, they have the same one dimension they have in all their movies of that ten year or so span. If you can get past the fact that the writers are incapable of creating identifiable characters, this is a very exciting and fun film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great when alight but far too soppy between infernos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Backdraft has some of the most impressive fire scenes ever shot and some daring stunt work (three of the leads, Kurt Russell, Scott Glenn and William Baldwin, are actually billed as stuntmen), but unfortunately it's wrapped up in a trite two-brothers-at-each-other's-throats plot that keeps it from being anything more than a high-priced soap opera with burning buildings. And, it has to be said, it looks a lot less impressive on the small screen than it did on the big one. Despite the ostensibly impressive ensemble cast, some of the supporting performances are weak, with Jennifer Jason Leigh proving big time that she really can't play 'normal' while Donald Sutherland's Hannibal Firelighter is too Looney Tunes to convince even in his brief screen time, while Baldwin is a considerably less compelling leading man than Russell but gets the lion's share of the screen time anyway. The result is a modestly entertaining but entirely predictable studio picture that plays everything but the conflagrations safe.While many of the plethora of deleted scenes on the recent Region 1 special edition DVD are trims or purely redundant, it seems that a lot of the murder mystery plot and much of Robert De Niro's lazy turn as an arson investigator also hit the cutting room floor, alongside a couple of good fraternal confrontations, but there's little to imply that a better film was left on the cutting room floor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Through The Fire Into The Light</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:You will never see fire effects like this in any other movie. Howard in the Blu Ray introduction talks about how digital fire, which was in its infancy here, looked awful so they went with real fire. I love the Towering Inferno but these fire effects are utterly breathtaking. What the actors and crew endured to make this movie in incredible. Russell, who I think is the greatest actor of his generation, steals the movie as Bull. Baldwin does a capable job but Russell's performance is one of his best. The movie focuses on a series of suspicious fires that seem to target specific individuals with a Backdraft blast that while killing the target burn themselves out. If you are in a series of brothers, like I am, you know how the first and second born battle it out like Bull and Brian. The first half of the movie Brian is trying again to become a fireman like his legendary older brother Bull. Their dad was killed right in front of Brian, an experience that pushes him to try and become what his dead father would have desired. Bull is no nonsense about training firemen; he pushes Brian and a war between the brothers ensues. It culminates in Brian giving up when Bull charges into a burning kitchen to save a child; Brian is frightened and waits outside the door.The film follows Brian working with DeNiro who plays a crafty fire investigator tracing the cause of these suspicious fires. When I tell you who plays the creepy Alderman, J.T. Walsh, movie goers will know right away who the villain of the movie turns out to be. One of the firemen is helping him, I won't spoil it for you. You will, frankly, be so overwhelmed with the stunning fire effects that you will fight to care for the story. The other star of the film is to show warriors lost within a merchant Zeitgeist who fight and die every day unnoticed or honored except by their own. The bravery these men display shows you that even within a Merchant society dedicated to profit, the warrior class still exists hidden away. You will feel such admiration and appreciation for them when you see what they endure to help others. This is what stops Brian, Bull walks right through the fire, oblivious to the danger because his courage is so deep. Brian just sits there and watches him emerge clutching a small child. As a movie, it is quite intense and depicts the social costs to the families of these brave men. How Bull's wife just cannot handle the terrors of losing him any moment. She loves him but flees from him.After you watch the movie, you will see firemen completely differently. All we ever see is them run into the building; this movie takes you inside showing you the incredible danger and bravery of these heroes. The music is majestic and powerful backing up the nobility of the imagery commensurately. A deeply moving powerful film about noble heroes lost within a merchant culture doing battle to save the helpless in their midst. A Great Movie Portraying Nobility Within The Flames.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noisy, overblown entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished this highly sentimental and overblown, but enjoyable fire fighting epic.Essentially it's about ace fire fighter Steven (Kurt Russell; heroic) and his rookie younger brother Brian (William Baldwin) joining the force, the competition and conflict between them, and how they overcome it. At least until about the halfway mark, when it becomes a mystery thriller with Robert De Niro playing an arson investigator, who Brian helps to find a pattern to the fires that have been breaking out over the city and uncover the identity of the arsonist. Oh, and Donald Sutherland plays Ronald. He's like a fire version of Hannibal Lecter, who makes Brian crack by asking him if he wanted to be like his father (dies at the start of the film).I'm really not sure what this film wanted to be. It starts out as a kind of drama about the camaraderie and conflict between a group of fire fighters, turns into a thriller about an arsonist and a conspiracy, then turns into a kind of horror film in which fire is made out to be a living thing with a mind of it's own and Brian's nemesis or something. There's even a scene of him using the hose against a blaze like Ripley uses the rifle against the aliens. And a scene of the fire communicating with him as he faces it. Then all these elements come together for an overblown action climax.The film is ridiculous, overblown, silly, sentimental, and I love it. It has it's eye-rolling moments sure, and it's very noisy, but it's fun, well acted, and very entertaining, so I give it a thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action but story overloaded</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts in Chicago 1971 when Brian McCaffrey witnesses his fire fighter father's death on the job. 20 years later, Brian (William Baldwin) returns home to be a probie working under his brother Stephen (Kurt Russell). The brothers don't get along. Stephen has moved out on his wife Helen (Rebecca De Mornay). Jennifer Vaitkus (Jennifer Jason Leigh) knows Brian from the past and is now working for ambitious alderman Swayzak (J.T. Walsh). There's an arsonist loose in the city and arson investigator Rimgale (Robert De Niro) is on the case. On his first fire, Brian rescues a mannequin but is mistaken with a heroic rescue. Stephen is knocking heads with Swayzak over cutbacks. Swayzak offers Brian a job to work with Rimgale.Director Ron Howard is showing that he has technical skills. The fires actually look beautiful. The action looks great. There are good stunts. There are great actors around. The action scenes are incredible. However there is a little too much unnecessary family melodrama. Then there is the criminal arson case and political intrigue. This is a case of less is more. It doesn't need all the complications. Kurt Russell is great but William Baldwin slinks around without much charisma. De Niro is doing his thing. Generally this is an over-written movie with some great fire action. The crime investigation is fine but it feels like an extension of the firefighting movie. This movie is just overloaded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Significantly Better than the Critics Claim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Ron Howard's best movies, but it is viewed by many as one of his worst. The fact is, it is indeed one of his best. The characters are perhaps a bit simple, with simple perspectives, but this a movie about firemen. From Ron Howards perspective, these are simple people who risk their lives because they love the rush. But within this community there is one individual who starts fires for the rush. Who and why? That is the challenge for the viewer and the answer is the whole point of the movie. Most critics miss the point of the whole movie and think this is a movie about two brothers who don't get along and are in competition. Then the movie is indeed superficial and not all that interesting.Treat this movie as a mystery, and you will appreciate the plot. The acting is excellent, the music is superb and the scenes involving fire are unique and engrossing. Enjoy the movie for what it is. Don't complain about what it was never intended to be. Anyone who looks at this movie as Greek tragedy deserves to be disappointed. This is great entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Backdraft" is a movie that I saw in theaters in 1991, on cable TV later, on DVD after that and just today on Blu-Ray. It is a movie that literally moves me more each time I see it. Definitely the best Baldwin performance ever, as the younger brother whose hero firefighter brother doesn't think her can cut it. Then in the climactic fire scene, the badly injured older brother watches his younger brother perform heroically and softly says, "That's my brother, goddammit." One of Kurt Russell's best performances and one of Ron Howard's more underrated films. And for the life of me, I don't see why some of the reviewers are dissing Rebecca DeMornay, who does a wonderful job in a thankless role. Really a wonderful movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Backdraft was actually not a bad movie. The plot wasn't amazing mainly because it never really gets suspenseful and it just seems kind of stupid how trained firemen keep getting killed by the same type of fire. But I don't think the plot is what made the movie interesting. The relationship between the two brothers (Baldwin and Russell) keep the viewer watching. This is actually one movie where I said "gee, Kurt Russell can actually act". Possibly the only time I'll say that. This was a stretch for him and I really liked it. Baldwin's character is OK for me, nothing amazing, but decent. I really liked Donald Sutherland too. Even though he was thrown in as a rip-off of Hannibal Lectar (crazy criminal who tells them who the killer is if you talk to him about your past blah blah blah). Even though he led them toward the wrong people, possibly on purpose, and it was almost meaningless to have in the plot, I like Sutherland no matter what he's in. Robert De Nero as always is too cool. You have to like him, even though his part wasn't as big in this one. All in all, decent flick, worth watching, and possibly better than Ladder 49, as far as firefighter movies go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wouldn't you just like to see stuff burning for two hours. Well, your wish is Ron Howard's command and the firefighting sequences in this movie are terrific and look uncannily realistic.As for the story, it is only mildly interesting. Kurt Russell as one of the rival brothers McCaffrey does his most accomplished acting in nearly all of his career. It's weird to think that this is the same man who made such bombs as Graceland, Soldier and Executive Decision, although that one was still pretty entertaining.Same goes for the other half, William Baldwin. Fair Game, anyone. It's weird to think that one little movie could pretty much ruin his whole career, except the bad press the Baldwin Bros. have always been subject to. Baldwin does come off as annoying, sometimes whiny and Jennifer Jason Leigh gives a surprisingly dull performance as his love interest.The supporting cast is a director's dream. We got Robert De Niro, Donald Sutherland and the very underrated J. T. Walsh who plays smarm as easy as breathing. Sadly, they don't add much to the proceedings. Donald Sutherland does have one big moment where he enlightens us about the attraction of fire to both firefighter and arsonist. Oh, did I forget to mention that. There is an arson on the loose and Sutherland plays sort of a mad scientist (if you consider arson a science) and De Niro plays the interrogator who knows just how to push Sutherland's buttons. Fun, but ultimately seen many times before. De Niro even looks like he didn't bother to shower for his 5 minute cameo.So, we come back to the attraction - the flames. They are pretty, pretty dangerous and give the actors a chance to do something they probably enjoy, smashing stuff - who wouldn't? Ron Howard would change gears dramatically a few years later and become the respected director with something on his mind. Maybe he did have something on his mind when he made Backdraft but maybe it burned out.</fullReview>

Now after being in the fire service, and you can ask any firefighter, we consider it a Comedy, wouldn't we love to be able to go on a fire walking in, see the fire, no smoke at all, find the people and get them out. In real life it's more like down on your knees, packed full of smoke, cant see a thing and need to whip out the thermal camera to find victims and manage your air. But I do realize it is only a move and when I was a kid a watched it over and over and it was AWESOME and probably a good reinforcement for me to go into firefighting. If you liked this move I highly suggest Ladder 49 with a more real presentation of the fire service and the History Channel's "Into the Fire" made for TV move/documentary.</fullReview>

Many of the scenes have a difficult to describe beauty...showing the world as more beautiful and clear than it really can be. Some of the scenes must have been shot in morning light to get this wonderful brilliance.Anyhow, the movie is about a family of Chicago firefighters overlapped with a sort of mystery about some suspicious deaths by fire.

		<fullReview>If You can watch a film without worrying about the plot, or corny acting, then Backdraft is definitely the one.However, if, like me, you like watching films that you can believe, then Backdraft has some serious flaws. It doesn't offer anything new, and there are hundreds of 90's action films that follow identical formulas, whilst not being quite as clunky.After two firefights, i'm thinking, this has got to go somewhere else, i mean, how many big fires are there in one city? Surely firemen do other things, such as getting cats out of trees? Well I was wrong, and the repetition continues again and again, up until the end.A good aspect of the film is the fire itself, well filmed, and I must say i felt quite hot while watching it, which suggests that two hours of watching fire without a story or acting would have been more suited to my taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Minorly Flawed Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Backdraft' is a classic film. Even now, 16 years later, the film still appeals to me every time I watch it. The story is compelling. Much of the acting is first-rate (especially from Kurt Russell, Donald Sutherland, Robert De Niro--of course!--and the late, great J.T. Walsh). But the most spectacular aspect is the special effects. Created when digital visual effects were in their infancy, the fire effects in 'Backdraft' are unparalleled in any other film, still.The film has its flaws, to be sure; the overall story suffers a bit from excessive sentimentality and cheese in a few places. And the stilted acting of William Baldwin and especially Jennifer Jason Leigh in this film is almost distracting.But, ultimately, these are minor flaws. If, by some miracle, you have never yet seen 'Backdraft', do yourself a favor and check it out. There is no other film that readily comes to my mind with more impressive stunt or special effects work. And it is a story with heart and conviction that I think has stood--and will stand--the test of time well.</fullReview>

Toss in a standard plot about another psycho arsonist terrorizing Chicago &amp; a couple of sexy love scenes between these heros and their leading ladies (Leigh &amp; the underused DeMornay respectively) and you have a good no-brainer slab of entertainment to pass the time with.Another good reason to watch this film: those high-quality firefighting scenes will remind you of the hell the NYFD went through at the World Trade Center on 9/11.

		<fullReview>BACKDRAFT Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound formats: 6-track Dolby Stereo / Q Sound(35mm and 70mm release prints)Two firefighting brothers (Kurt Russell and William Baldwin) are forced to confront the ghosts of their past whilst pursuing an arsonist who targets prominent members of Chicago's political elite.Former TV actor Ron Howard ("Happy Days") directed this high-profile Hollywood blockbuster, in which a cast of solid B-list actors and A-list supporting players (Robert DeNiro, Donald Sutherland, et al) are upstaged by scenes of fiery devastation, wrought with frightening intensity by incredible stuntwork and state-of-the-art visual effects. Plot-wise, the film is an old-fashioned barnstormer, directed with gee-whizz efficiency by Howard, whose attempts to wring high emotion from Greg Widen's corny script rings entirely false from the outset. Hans Zimmer's generic music score is overbearing in places, particularly during the 'tragic' finale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a longtime fire buff and I can remember watching this film on "Saturday Night At The Movies" on ABC back when I was 11 in October 2002 and than again on USA Network in November 2003. For the most part, I don't have any complaints about the film, except air masks aren't worn in certain segments of the film. I really enjoy the special effects, lighting, designs, story idea, and that firefighters are true heroes. I thought that Kurt Russell and the other cast members gave spectacular performances. To add to that, I was born in the year this film came out. Hard to believe that 2015 marks 24 years for Backdraft! Hooray for Backdraft! Yay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much wrong with Backdraft, just a really good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Backdraft is really good, in a cheesy, unrealistic, hard to believe, still really good way. A Hollywood adaptation of firefighting that doesn't portray firefighting in completely believable light. In Backdraft, the way that these firemen fight the fire dead head on is really incredible to watch, even if it is unrealistic to a certain degree. I agree that these firefighters would probably be burnt up into a crisp within the first two minutes of the job. They're way too busy hanging out next to the fire not paying attention to it, not focusing on their gear or the task at hand, too busy smiling, posing for the camera, slicking back their hair in the hydrant water, busy racing each other carrying hoses up staircases, rescuing mannequins out of burning buildings, too busy picking fights at the company ball and lighting up cigarettes at the scene of the fire. I don't know if these guys are superfirefighters or supernitwits. But it all works well, and it's a real lovely film. Backdraft excels during the firefighter action sequences. The firefighting moments are about the best parts of Backdraft. They're really, really good. Ron Howard brings Backdraft to life, doing an excellent job directing the camera, especially during those firemen versus the blazes scenes. Robert De Niro is one of the great actors. When Robert De Niro's character appears in Backdraft, Backdraft turns up the heat and gets much better. I can easily say that De Niro's character is the single polished piece, while all the other characters are too one dimensional. Credit De Niro as well as the superior written character. The main character played by William Baldwin is really rather weak. Kurt Russell is a real likable hero as his character was much easier to get along with. Donald Sutherland as well as De Niro's character are both a step above in quality and in so they seem relatively out of place in their roles. Backdraft has really bad female characters. The firemen are playing grab ass with each other so much that it could have used some female dynamic, really. I'm all for a movie for the guys, and grab assing, but Backdraft misses the mark in that respect. Jennifer Jason Leigh is good in her poor part and Rebecca DeMornay is the closest thing to a significant female presence but not very close at all. Backdraft lacks good, insightful dialogue and has bad character development and interaction. Not much wrong with Backdraft, just a really good movie. Backdraft is a common man's classic. Backdraft is easily accommodatingly favorable to the audience. I feel how people can relate to Backdraft and really love it, especially firemen, and I'm there with them. Backdraft is the best fireman film. It's completely agreeable and an absolute success, a thumbs up, wait no, two thumbs way up! It has a good soundtrack to it, and the story really jumps off the screen with larger than life characters that heavily hit home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Barn burner of a movie that generated an astounding 172 million dollars in ticket sales at home ,the USA, and abroad "Backdraft" is by far the most successful, beating "The Towering Inferno" record by over 100 million dollars in earnings, fire fighting film in motion picture history. The movie centers around two firemen brother Stephen &amp; Brain McCaffrey,Kurt Russell &amp; William Baldwin who work out of Chicago's Chinatown elite 17th Hook &amp; Ladder Engine Company who are at odds with each other. It's Stephen who feels that his kid brother Brian isn't up to task of being a top grade firefighter and tries to persuade him to quit the job and do something far less dangerous. I was the death of his father fire Captain Dennis McCaffery, also played by Kurt Russell, that Brain witnessed back in 1971 when he was 12 that not only left deep emotional scares on him but got him to want to be a fire fighter himself like his dad even if it ended up killing him. A number of suspicious fires or back-drafts break out in Chicago where the victims are high placed contributers and contributers to Chicago's Alderman Martin Swayzak,J,T Walsh, champaign for city mayor. It's fire &amp; arson Inspector Donald "Shadow" Rimgale,Robert De Niro, who smells a rat in all this and is sure the fires were deliberately started to kill only those, the city contractors, that they targeted and no one else. With Brian getting a job as Rimgale assistant the two uncover a plot to kill off those who together with Alderman Swayzak are scheming to close down a number of fire stations and give them over to top real estate interests in Chicago. This would not only cause the remaining fire stations to get overworked but also end up costing the lives of firefighter as well as the people that their risking their lives to rescue!Running up against a number of stone walls both Fire Inspector Rimgale &amp; his partner Stephen McCaffery get assisted by master arsonist who's serving a life sentence for a slew of arson related murders, which included Captain Dennis McCaffery, Ronald "Firebug" Bartel, Donald Sutherland. It's Bartel who's an old hand at these kinds of things, arson fires, who uncovers just how those mysterious back drafts were started and what chemicals were used to both start them and cause the fires to burn themselves out, after killing those it intended to roast, before causing any more deaths or damage! And worst of all as things soon turn out it's non other then the late Captain Dennis McCaffrey's son fire Lt. Stephen McCaffery who's unknowingly supplying the mysterious arsonist with the deadly chemical compounds to do it.**SPOILERS** "Baby Light my Fire" final with both Lt. Stephen McCaffery and kid brother Brian getting caught up in a major chemical fire that not only goes completely out of control but ends up with Stephen having it out with the person who's involved in the deadly series of arson fires that targeted prominent Chicago businessmen. Explosive ending much like the ending in the 1949 film "White Heat" as the entire chemical plant goes up in flames with only Brian surviving and together with Inspector Rimgale keeping the truth, of who was the arsonist, from the public. It was a truth far too hard and painful to take and by keeping it from seeing the light of day it ended up finishing what the mysterious and now deceased arsonist started. Preventing Alderman Swayzak from not only becoming Chicao's next mayor but putting him behind bars, for extortion and receiving illegal payoffs, as well!P.S Kurt Russell and T,J Walsh were so good together in the film that they were reunited six years later in the kidnap desert thriller "Breakdown".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good For Not Having a Leading Lady</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring: Backdraft was release in theaters on May 24, 1991 and it was 132 minutes long. Backdraft is a 1991 American action-drama film directed by Ron Howard and written by Gregory Widen. The film stars Kurt Russell, William Baldwin, Robert De Niro, and Scott Glenn. Donald Sutherland, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Rebecca De Mornay, Jason Gedrick, and J.T. Walsh co-star in the film. The story is about firefighters in Chicago on the trail of a serial arsonist who sets fires with a fictional chemical substance, trychtichlorate. The film received three Academy Award nominations (Sound Effects Editing, Visual Effects, and Best Sound). It also received two nominations at the first annual MTV Movie Awards. The film grossed $77,868,585 in its domestic run and $74,500,000 from foreign markets, making it the highest grossing film ever made about firefighters. The films rated R for firefighting-related violence, strong language, a scene of sensuality, and brief nudity.Summary: The movie tells the story of a group of Chicago firefighters at Engine 17, two of whom are brothers. Lt. Stephen "Bull" McCaffrey (Kurt Russell), the elder brother, is obsessed with the beating of the fires that he fights. He is always at the heart of the fire - the most dangerous part of the fire. Brian McCaffrey (William Baldwin), Stephen's younger brother, has labored under his brother's shadow all his life, having quit the firefighting academy several years prior to the movie's beginning. He returns to firefighting after a number of other career attempts falter, though Stephen has doubts that Brian is able to see things through, as well as possibly not having the correct temperament required of a firefighter, dismissing his return to firefighting as another temporary fancy. As a child, Brian was bullied by Stephen and witnessed the death of their father firsthand when a gas pipe ruptured and burned him alive; this is shown in flashback and we see that a Life photographer captured the moment when young Brian looks up at the fire that killed his father, holding his father's helmet in his hands. The popularity of the photograph follows Brian the rest of his life, hindering his attempts to pursue a serious firefighting career. Donald "Shadow" Rimgale (Robert De Niro) is an arson investigator who is highly dedicated to his profession. (The real Donald Rimgale, a veteran Chicago fire investigator, served as one of the technical advisor's on the film.) He's called in because a number of fires that have occurred have somewhat similar connections. Convicted arsonist Ronald (Donald Sutherland) has been imprisoned for many years and can appear very normal on occasions but at the mention of fire his mind becomes obsessed with the idea of living fire (he calls it "The Animal"), one that takes over not only buildings but also people's lives. His latest application for parole is turned down. It appears as if Ronald was a firefighter because of his comments to Brian; "It looked like it was just going to be a 'medium deal' when your father bought it" - In the opening moments of the film Brian's father asks Adcox if it was a big deal and Adcox replies "Medium deal, Cap'". In addition, "Did you see him when he made that ballsy jump and saved that kid?" Brian later consults Ronald for advice when Brian cannot determine the missing link in the recent arson's. The longest serving of all the firefighters, John "Axe" Adcox (Scott Glenn), served under the McCaffreys' father in the Chicago Fire Department and was like an uncle to the two boys when their father died. He takes great pride in his work and has a love of the department. Obviously brave, he is the firefighter who "takes the pipe" and attacks the fire head on, but is also concerned about Stephen's blatantly unorthodox methods, and disregard of safety procedures. An important scene to show the distrust of the other men occurs when 17 answers a call in a high-rise building downtown. Stephen urges to move in quickly to take out the fire. Brian's friend and fellow probie Tim Krizminski (Jason Gedrick), under Stephen's wing, accidentally opens a door, only to be met by a backdraft. His face is badly burned beyond recognition, but he survives. His team, on the other hand, ridicules Stephen, later getting into an intense argument with Adcox at the hospital, as well as a brawl with Brian.Questions: What does City Council Member Martin Swayzak has to do with all of this? How are all of these fires getting started? Is someone paying someone off to keep quiet about the fires? How many more fires will there be before someone dies? Now a few thoughts on this movie! This is one of those movies where you start on the edge of your sit and you never move. The action and drama in this picture was fantastic. This picture also was great without a leading lady. Based on this, I give this movie 8 weasel stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Backdraft, which came out in May of 1991, was a technological standout at the time. The visual and sound effects were nothing like has ever been done previously. Even by today standards, this movie has to have some of the most jaw-dropping fire sequences ever in the history of film. Not only the special effects are top-notch, this movie also delivers some drama and characterization.This movie is about two rival fireman brothers who ends up working at the same department in Chicago. They are to investigate a series of fire-related crimes while keeping their rivalry at bay.The acting is nothing special. The leads gave good performances. Kurt Russell stood out in my mind. Of course, I loved Robert De Niro as I usually do.Overall, this is a great special-effects laden film that is perfect for the summer. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is excellent, I saw it at the theater when it came out and I wasn't disappointed. I come from a firefighting family; and was a Fire Explorer with The City of Vandalia, Ohio. I learned a lot about what my dad went through while he was Captain for the Dayton Fire Department in Ohio. He would tell me some of the awful experiences he had and how the job is not that easy. I would later learn first hand what a firefighter goes though but being a Fire Explorer and the movie Backdraft makes it look like a cakewalk sometimes. What I liked about the movie was the storyline; and it had an excellent one. The only negative I had was the errors of fighting fire's, i.e., when Bull's brother takes a fire hose and tries to put out the fire by himself. It's a fact no one person has complete control of a fire hose, the are heavy, powerful, and with water blasting through it you need a crew to hold the hose. Also when fighting a fire all firefighter's must have their breathing apparatus on.I hope I help people by just telling you the plot of the story, I don't want to ruin it for you, it's an excellent movie that everyone should see. There's 5 minutes of the story starting out in 1971, about the boys father and his occupation a a Chicago firefighter. Then it is present day, 1991. The rookies have got their station assignments and it's off to being a full fledged fire-fighter. Bull's younger brother is assigned to his station. It's business as usual until mysterious fires start to breakout in Chicago. Enter Robert DeNiro character, Don Rimgale. With the help of Don "The Shadow" Rimgale it is up to the City of Chicago's Fire Department to find out who is setting the fires and why; before more people get killed.This movie came out in the early 1990's it's a great film for the whole family; but could be too much for 12yrs. and younger. It is rated R, for language, violence, scenes of peril; and 2 scenes of arson victims. I rate this film an 8/10 due to the errors in fighting fires. It is still one hell of a movie.Kris L.

		<shortDescription>An everyday story of firefighting folk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard does a good job of putting together an action movie about firefighters. To give it a human dimension he puts, at the heart of it, a family feud between two brothers from a family of firefighters, played by Kurst Russell and a Baldwin (it's not the Beetlejuice one - that's Alec - nor the Usual Suspects one - that's James - nor the pudgy one - that's Daniel - so it must be Stephen, I suppose).The soapy stuff is just a hook to hang the excitement on. It is OK, it keeps you involved and invested, but it's not what you're here for, is it? Neither is the suspense over the identity of the firebug, helped enormously by Donald Sutherland's giggling nutcase and Robert De Niro's stolid investigator. No, you're here for the fires, the explosions, the risk to life and limb.Good news - Howard does an exemplary job marshalling those resources, and delivers a film which is hot with spectacle and excitement. These is nothing extra-special about Backdraft, but it is a very entertaining action/adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the daughter of a Chicago Firefighter this film tugs at my heart strings. Any firefighter knows this movie and can probably recite the lines word for word. I admit, I may be biased, since I have seen this movie about 100 times since I was 6 years old but this movie really captures what it is like to be a firefighter. It portrays what firemen go through on a daily basis. It shows the bravery they have to have in order to run into a burning building, while everyone else is running out. The plot is well thought out and convincing, as it should be, since it was written by a fireman. It has a little bit of everything: Action, Romance, Drama, and Mystery. Robert DeNiro, Kurt Russell, and Billy Baldwin are at their prime and really give great performances. Sure, since it was made in 1991, the special effects aren't as great as they would be had the movie been made more recently, but this movie is still worth a watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this film again quite recently and I have to say that while it is an entertaining film by Ron Howard and company it is also a dedication to real heroes. Firefighters have a job I could never do and this film honors that heroic behavior. The special effects are amazing during the fire sequences. The entire cast is excellent and special kudos to Donald Sutherland in a small but memorable couple of scenes as a convicted arsonist, a great line "Did the fire look at you". How has he never won an academy award is beyond me. Kurt Russell is his usual everyman but one of his better performances here. The last scenes during the funeral procession on Michigan Ave. breaks my heart so many of these men risk their lives every day. Firefighters are true heroes and we should honor them every day. Look watch this not the sub par Ladder 49. Great film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Backdraft" tells the story of a group of Chicago firefighters. (A "backdraft" is technical term used by firefighters, referring to an explosion resulting from the rapid re-introduction of oxygen to a fire in an oxygen-starved environment.) There are three interlinked elements to the plot. The first element concerns the rivalry between two brothers, Stephen and Brian McCaffrey. Stephen, the elder, is an experienced firefighter, but despite his experience has an aggressive, unorthodox attitude towards tackling fires and is prepared to take risks. (The fact that his nickname is "Bull" suggests an impulsive, headstrong personality. Brian, the younger, is an inexperienced greenhorn with a quieter, more cautious personality than his brother, who has doubts about Brian's suitability for the job. Brian, however, is desperate to follow in the footsteps of their father, Dennis, himself also a firefighter who was killed in the line of duty.The second plot element involves the hunt for a serial arsonist responsible for starting fires which have killed several people. (He starts them with the aid of a chemical named trychtichlorate, an entirely fictitious substance. The filmmakers presumably did not want to give any help or suggest any methods to real-life arsonists). The third element involves Martin Swayzak, an ambitious local politician who hopes to be elected mayor of Chicago. Swayzak is a controversial figure because he has made cuts to the budget of the Chicago Fire Department, cuts which, it is claimed, are putting lives at risk.The film was directed by Ron Howard, one of Hollywood's best-known directors. Although Howard has worked in various different genres and does not have an immediately identifiable directorial style, one theme which seems to run through his more serious films (he has also made a number of comedies) is that of heroism. "Backdraft" is one of a number of his films (others include "Willow", "The Paper", "Apollo 13", "A Beautiful Mind", "The Missing" and "Cinderella Man") which explore different types of courage, both physical and moral, and here we come to realise that Stephen and Brian are both, in their different ways, very brave men.The film has a distinguished cast, starring Kurt Russell and William Baldwin as the two brothers, alongside the likes of Robert De Niro, Scott Glenn, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Rebecca De Mornay. The contribution which perhaps stands out the most comes from Donald Sutherland as an imprisoned arsonist. His character, Ronald Bartel, has some similarities to Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter from "The Silence of the Lambs", which was made a couple of years later. Like Lecter, Bartel is a psychopathic criminal who is called upon to help solve a crime of the type which he himself, prior to his arrest, specialised in committing. Like Lecter, Bartel is capable of appearing completely normal for most of the time, then suddenly becoming a raving maniac.The real star of the film, however, is the fire itself. (The same can be said of some other firefighting dramas, notably "The Towering Inferno"). The firefighters in this film tend to personalise fire, referring to it as "Old Man Fire" or "the beast", and the conflagrations we see do seem to be moving with a mind of their own. The film was nominated for a "Best Visual Effects" Academy Award, and twenty years on the action sequences do still seem remarkable. Although the acting and the script are solid enough, it is the fire scenes that we remember the film for. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has it's moments to shine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Backdraft completes its goal of being a Hollywood blockbuster starring Kurt Russel as an angry authority figure.However, from a firefighter's point of view, this movie falls drastically short of anything resembling realistic. Although fire, more or less, behaves in the way depicted in the movie (i.e. the smoke recessing under the door as every last bit of oxygen in the room is consumed, and the explosion after introducing a fresh oxygen source to the), a firefighter would never enter a burning building with an open jacket, an unstrapped helmet, without protective pants, and ESPECIALLY without a self-contained breathing apparatus (air pack).This is not only against every occupational hazard law ever written, it is deadly. This is only the beginning of a list of several flagrant inconsistencies with proper firefighting guidelines, but unfortunately, a properly dressed and safe firefighter isn't heroic in the Hollywood sense, so Ron Howard had to take some creative liberties with reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exciting, visually fantastic film about two brothers, one a natural firefighter, the other who wishes he was. Ron Howard's very entertaining film has two plots, one involving the conflicts between the brothers, and the other concerning some very mysterious 'accidental' deaths.The special effects are dazzling, along with sets and cinematography. Hans Zimmer's music is effective, as are performances by Kurt Russell, William Baldwin, Robert De Niro and Donald Sutherland. The stellar cast is rounded off by Scott Glenn, who is excellent in a movie that just falls short of top marks, perhaps only because the plot was a little hazy in explaining itself.Sunday, August 11, 1991 - Knox District CentreOnly action sequences hold "Backdraft" up a second time. Plot fails to inspire interest on return viewing.Friday, August 23, 1991 - Knox District CentreVisual splendour is what makes Ron Howard's "Backdraft" the entertaining film it is. Both special effects and sound effects are top notch.

		<fullReview>Stephen(Kurt Russell) and Brian McCafrey (William Baldwin) are two brothers, who have, ever since their old man died, wanted to be firemen. Stephen is by far more experienced than Brian, his younger brother.Stephen welcomes Brian to his team and Brian gets introduced to Stephen's friends. But after a short while, Brian doesn't quite feel like he fits in the team as the naive, rookie firefighter; so therefore he accepts Marty Swayzak's (J.T. Walsh, the man who is running for mayor) offer to work with Donald 'Shadow' Rimgale (Robert De Niro, the local fire investigator). There have been three murders (all of them caused by fire), and Brian and 'Shadow' are convinced that these murders are connected to each other and their job is to find out who it is that has started these so-called "Backdrafts".All in all, this is a suspense action thriller that is worth watching. Especially Kurt Russell and Scott Glenn are outstanding in this film.Additional cast include Scott Glenn, Donald Sutherland, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jason Gedrick and Rebecca De Mornay.Rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

Ron Howard did a great job on directing.In closing, I'd like to say that if you're expecting to see perfect firefighting sequence,go find a good episode of "Emergency!" on the tube, but if you want a good movie about interpersonal relationships between firemen, see this film:)</fullReview>

Backdraft is very inspiring on showing us how two feuding simblings work together and put their differences aside, while risking their lives at the same time. Highly recommendable and very enjoyable. Great special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So few comments for this film! A film about which its viewers have wildly different views! (POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD, SO BE YE ADVISED; HERE ENDETH THE WARNING.)Me, personally, I enjoyed it at the theatre, but I thought the ending was way too neat and tidy. The plot was already a little far-fetched anyway, stretching credibility to the breaking point. Would a fireman, someone devoted to saving lives and keeping people from harm...would a fireman really turn to assassination as a method of revenge? Not just assassination, but incredibly elaborate assassinations; these murders required incredibly intricate planning and exquisite timing. How did he manage it? Did he have a detailed appointment schedule for these men? How did he know exactly when they would show up at the right place? How did he get into their homes without attracting any attention? (Okay, that one's not so hard to swallow.)Not to mention the fact that, darn it, I wanted to see more of the firefighting action and less of the subplot. I didn't care about the corrupt mayor or any of that. I wanted fire. I love fire. I want to burn the world! Everything should burn! BURN IT ALL!Signed, Ronald</fullReview>

Why wasn't Kurt Russell nominated for an Oscar? Well in my opinion, he should have been. His performance was WONDERFUL!!!! There were also many other great actors in this movie, Robert DeNiro and J.T. Walsh. Billy Baldwin also gave an outstanding performance. This movie inspired both my son and son-in-law to become firefighters. I think they have both seen in 100 times. GREAT MOVIE!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film making at it's best. A perfect 10!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Backdraft back when it was released in 1991. I was around 14 years old at the time and it made a profound impact on me. It made me appreciate the role Firefighters make and the risks they take. Even though the actions of the characters may not be performed exactly like real Firefighters do (go into a burning building with no oxygen masks on) but that is why it is called a movie. I have watched this film many times (I mean really watched the film) and saw the pure genius of it. The way Ron Howard directs this film, shows you why he is considered by some, one of the most inspired Directors of are time. Ron took control and made the scenes of the movie come alive. With simple things like the placement of the camera and making sure that each scene is done with the fullest potential. Even though the cast was not all Superstars, Ron Howard seem to some how make actors like Kurt Russell and William Baldwin (which I believe are these actors greatest performances to date) to perform above and beyond their norm. And the terrific performances by Robert De Niro (as usual), and Donald Sutherland as Ronald the `Insane Fire Bug' in which acts frightfully well. Also the very beautiful and talented Jennifer Jason Leigh makes a supporting role in the film. Her role is disappointedly too short in the film but she does an excellent job with her character `Jennifer Vaitkus'. As everyone knows the Special Effects in the film are awesome, even to this day. But if you look underneath the movie magic you'll find a most interesting story line and a great hero story for all. I know some people do not like this movie at all and I will never understand why. I just suggest that they should go back and really watch the film again and maybe they could see why I find it one of the GREATEST FILMS OF ALL TIME. This is one of the few movies that made me cry (at the end). If you have never seen Backdraft, it is DEFINITELY worth checking out. This movie has it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was nice to see a movie about Fire Fighters on the big screen. The plot wasn't too bad, the action kept me interested and the actors did good work. However, as Hollywood is known to do, they twist things to make them appear better. There were many fire fighting scenes where nobody would have survived without the correct protective gear. But, here we have some John Wayne Fire Fighters who can live through anything. I hope nobody dies trying what they did in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every profession seems to have a definitive movie or television show written around it, movies that either glorify that profession, or try and be true to life, giving the general public and idea of what its like to work in that area. I enjoy the latter more, the former skewing facts in the interest of drama. This is particularly true for Emergency Services.Unfortunately, I think 'Backdraft' falls into the former category, being somewhat unrealistic and just throwing procedure right out the window. However, being a firefighter, Backdraft is the definitive movie for the profession. Granted I am a volunteer rather than a higher trained career firefighter as those depicted in this movie are, but I think I can fairly say that firefighters need a better movie than this one. Sure, we all like being portrayed as Kurt Russell with a tyke under our arm, but I think a reality based movie would be great. Show what happens if an SCBA malfunctions. Show the routine injuries that happen to firefighters, the scrapes, cuts, bruises and bumps.I may get my pink slip for not falling down and worshipping Backdraft like a firefighter should, but I have to honestly say that Backdraft, while having some great effects, particularly in the kinetics of fire, could have done a lot better. Besides that, and Donald Sutherland's performance (its not bad), there's not much here.</fullReview>

It also has, for me, one of the most memorable lines in movie history. As Bull is trapped in a fire and his inexperienced brother is left to fight the fire, Russell delivers the line, "That's my brother God dammit!" so perfectly that it freezes the moment so that you can actually see the pride in the dying firefighter's eyes. This is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time.</fullReview>

Living in Chicago, I'm quite aware of the history of corrupt politics in the city. This movie is only embarrassment towards the real firefighters of Chicago. Pick another city have correct politics.

And this is from 1991 before digital visual effects. I remembered not liking this when it came out -- I saw the pan and scan version on VHS. -- It is much better in letterbox on the large hi-def screen.

After becoming unnerved during a fire, Brian pulls strings to get into an investigative office.But he is now not putting out the arsonist's fires, but trying to track him down.....It's the cinematic equivalent of Baywatch, fire fighting is sexy and cool, but makes the person a little edgier, because it's dangerous.And at the end of the day, every goes to a bar, and gets drunk and acts really happy. Because they are. They have beautiful homes, beautiful families and life is just peachy.Or so Ron Howard would have you believe.It's the type of film where the lead character has a boat, and you will find him there drinking beer.It's the kind of film that guest stars Robert De Niro, because he's prolific, but on the wain slightly.Add a silly sub plot involving arson, and you get a decidedly average movie.At least the flames look good, and Russell is on fire (ha ha), as usual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterful Performance in a Film loaded with Masterful Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that Backdraft is one of my all time favourite action movies. I'm unable to go to theatres to watch movies anymore because of some brain damage I can't watch a whole movie at one sitting so over the past 13 years we have collected about 300 DVDs so that I can watch the classic movies that I like in manageable pieces and my husband gave me a copy of Backdraft last week. I have watched it enough in this past week to have seen it all 3 or 4 times and there are so many great things about this movie it's hard to know what to pick out - the direction, the cinematography, the amazing special effects, the story itself, the fire, the music and all the performances are wonderful but one performance for me, stands out even above all the other great performances. Donald Sutherland's portrayal of Ronald is brilliant, absolutely convincing and chilling, especially in his second scene when it's just Ronald and Brian on screen. I have skipped back and re-watched this performance several times today and every time I've watched it I've been amazed at just how good he is - he is Ronald and every time I watch that second scene he makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I've been a fan of Donald Sutherland for several decades and this performance for me is a standout in a career that has been loaded with standout performances. If you want to see a master at work among other masters at work, watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my life. The plot is outstanding and the whole movie looks very expensive due to a large budget. It features many well-known actors like Kurt Russel, William Baldwin, Robert De Niro, Rebeca De Mornay, Scott Glen or Donald Sutherland. Their performances are great and even the other less known actors make a great job. I love the atmosphere, it's full of thrill and emotions from the beginning till the very end. The story is about two brothers (Russel and Baldwin) whose father was killed by an explosion. Twenty years after the tragedy they both become fire-fighters to show they can be like their father. While the older of them (Russel) has a successful career as a fire-chief, the younger (Baldwin) fights with inner fear and with the determination to be better than his brother. After a big disillusion he decides to stop fighting fires and work as a fire-investigator and he joins an experienced professional (R. De Niro). The plot is complicated and elaborate with many unexpected plot twists and many great effects. I really recommend this masterpiece to everyone?.. It's a definite must see :o)</fullReview>

I recently saw Ladder 49 and although it was a decent movie, the portrayal of the firefighters seemed more of a joke than anything. C'Mon! Travolta CANNOT be a firefighter!!! I really think 'Backdraft' is the ultimate tribute movie. If there were 1,200,700 firefighters (watch the credits) back in '98, just imagine how many there are now?!?!?! Thanks Boys!!

		<fullReview>The Concept: 'Top Gun' meets 'Towering Inferno'This is your only spoiler warning...In these post-9/11 days, this is more of an insult to firefighters than a redeemer. The story and acting is an excuse, we knew that. After all, this is the with the director and editing crew of 'Cocoon', the writer of 'Highlander', and (the worst) a production designer from Hyams' work. Even the sound was atrocious, Zimmer does Bruckheimer-grade work and the sound team probably skimped on this to make 'T2' sound better.No, I saw this to see the use of fire. Fire is a tricky subject and is harder to manage than water. So, I was surprised to see Salomon's name attached to this. He changed our view of water with the abstract 'Abyss', where water was an almost-mythical element that had depth (no pun intended) and tone. The water exerted mood while not being in your face.That's where Howard goofed up. Here the fire has no abstract qualities. It's only a "slasher character" and Howard shoots it as such--a simple-minded, yet threatening, sentient being. No subtexts like the Alien Queen, just Godzilla. He throws in "slasher-style" corpses to emphasize the point. DeNiro doesn't add any appreciative qualities, how sad. Since Howard simplifies any topic he does, that he endures is puzzling. That he has succeeded is a tragedy.How has Howard shown us he's matured? By throwing in locker room talk, of course. Sounds as intelligent as a McDonald's commercial.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a movie chock-full-of awesome actors, I must echo the sentiment of several other viewers who have posted comments on IMBD; the movie was long and fractured. However, I respectfully disagree with some on the idea of the plot. I think the plot was an excellent idea. There were several aspects of the movie that turned me off. The most irritating was Steven McCaffrey (Russell) entering the fires without a Scott-pack. I mean REALLY, come on. I realize that Howard was trying to portraying McCaffrey as an on-the-edge, suicidal maverick and renegade who could survive thick, black, acrid smoke, but it failed to convey him as superhuman; instead, it dehumanized him. Insofar as Deniro is concerned, why he chose to be in this movie is beyond me. Obviously, money was a factor. I think Russell's portrayal of McCaffrey was decent, but perhaps Scott Glenn would've been the better choice as the lead role. In my opinion, Glenn comes across more grizzled. Sutherland, as usual, was amazing. He is one of the most versatile actors to grace the screen. Baldwin was blah. Jennifer Jason Leigh, although nice to look at, was blah.Overall, I would give Backdraft 2.5 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

So, how did this movie end up so poor?!?! Well, the plot was about 95% predictable and the characters were about as 1-dimensional as possible. And the dialog?! What person would actually allow themselves to receive credit for coming up with the STUPID macho bull-crap that purports to be dialog? You get much greater realism from most cartoons! The bottom line is that this movie has some good points but is so marred by hackneyed clichés and rotten dialog that it quickly becomes tiresome. And, this is a shame, because firemen deserve a better tribute than this mess! If you don't believe me, look at the number of goofs listed on IMDb for this movie--WAY in excess of what you'd expect to find. They just didn't care enough to work out all the kinks and problems. So, as a result the movie seems rushed and in need of a re-write and re-editing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie many times noe, and I can understand that many people slam this film for being corny and unrealistic. And they are right, it is corny, but it is acted and directed with conviction, that it is hard for me not to like it. The core of the movie the story of 2 feuding firefighter brothers played by Kurt Russell and Adam Baldwin. This part of the story may be clichéd, but the 2 actors do a good job in their roles, especially Russell, he plays the elder brother, trying to protect his screwup younger brother from the dangers of firefighting. The other parts are less successful, there is a subplot involving the wife of Russell's wife inabilty to deal with his risk taking in his job, Rebecca DeMornay does what she can with a small role. The other subplot of the story is the one that doesn't work, it involves the murders of financial experts hire by a city alderman to close down firestations for financial gain. This part of the story should have been scrapped, it just chops up screen time and is never compelling. That leaves the action scenes, they are spectacular. The fire scenes keep you on the edge of your seat. The special effects are great, but even though the script is corny the actors made me care enough for what was happening to them. It is directed by Ron Howard, who usually is more successful in the human side of the story, he seems to have spent more time on the technical side of the story than the human side. Too bad, even though I like this film, it misses greatness due to a weak script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Backdraft displays Ron Howard's typical brilliance in addition to his other two favourites of mine, being 'Apollo 13" and " A beautiful mind".I will not elaborate on the story line of this movie as other contributors have already done well in giving the hint of what it is about. Backdraft displays the typical dysfunctionalities that exist amongst siblings, but also reminds us that in the event of desperate situations, blood will always be thicker than water.The McCaffrey brothers (performed by William Baldwin and Kurt Russell) are both firefighters who do not see eye to eye. Yet, many events in this movie remind us that life is too short to keep grudges, argue over what we cannot change and to learn to show tolerance. The two brothers are always at each other during their line of work, but there comes a time when caught in a life threatening situation, Kurt Russell swallows his pride acknowledging his brother's heroic act in shouting "That is my brother there".I must say that the contribution of the LIFE magazine in the story line is very impacting and I find it essential. Thinking about it, this movie is about the every day struggles of life. We have all picked up a LIFE magazine at some time in our lives and if you are lucky to have one from the 1960's, you will notice that it is no ordinary magazine, which really impacts life (where the title of the magazine suits it perfectly). The young boy on the cover of the magazine with the fireman's hat begs to be heard and seen, almost to the point of asking you " I have something to tell you, please listen to my LIFE story"Although the storyline is based upon firefighters, it equally extrapolates to any other hazardous occupation, as it also displays a reminder of how many unsung heroes risk their lives for the benefit of mankind. During a penultimate scene one of the McCaffrey brothers dies in the line of duty and a very moving scene is well performed at the state funeral. This movie would have equally worked well if the roles of firefighters would have been substituted by paramedics (or any emergency rescue team) or even any employees exposed to a hazardous environment. It serves as a good reminder of what we often take for granted. Yes, the movie does seem have other complexities which could be debated as to whether they should have been part of this movie, but life itself is complex. I also liked the closing scene where life goes on as the surviving McCaffrey brother returns to his every day work and a small subtitle is displayed to remind us of how many firefighters continue to risk their lives in the line of duty. A beautiful piece of work</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well what to say? There isn't anything negative to say about Backdraft, even if one isn't a fan of the movie one must concede it's got incredible visuals, outstanding acting and is so strongly real and vivid(characters and story jump out at you) that you are sort of glued to your seat.I was very touched by the previous reviewer's comments and don't have much to add because that kind of says it all. Let me be honest,Backdraft isn't one of my favorite movies and it isn't a movie I think I could sit through again, it is disturbing and it is painful to watch at times. It is however more then a welldone movie, it's superbly written, directed and acted and its a film that anyone associated with can be proud of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember about ten years ago I saw Backdraft at the theater with my two aunts and two older male friends and I must say I enjoyed the time. I just finished watching Backdraft a couple of hours ago on the USA Network and I once again enjoyed the work of Ron Howard. I must say Ron Howard is a genius any project he does is so good many people feel the plot of Backdraft is great but I feel the spectacular effects that Ron Howard developed are the highlights just watch many of the fire scenes. Sure the plot is centered around a sibling rival as a arrogant veteran fireman(Kurt Russell) helps develop his younger brother(William Baldwin) into a caring hero and a fireman of great courage much like the dead dad they had which you find that out in the films start. I must mention this scene I know you have heard of love on a rooftop but how about love on top of a fire engine notice the William Baldwin and Jennifer Jason Leigh scene hey people try different things! Sure the suspense of finding the person responsible for committing the crimes of arson thrills us but the spectacular effects that Ron Howard included made us fear fire in different ways and probably or at least should have raised arson awareness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard. Engraved in the memory of the 70's generation. Richie Cunningham to many. Well, if you've watched ANY television during the last six months, you've seen his balding red head on TV, bragging his new film, The Grinch. Well, it's probably the first time you see him to this extent on TV, he HAS directed other films, including the 1991 film Backdraft.Kurt Russell and William Baldwin star as brothers, both of them firefighters. You see, their dad died when they were kids, so they both became firefighters. Anyway, they both work in the same place and little Billy (look, I'm too lazy to look up their names. One of them is Bryan.) is having trouble, so soon enough he quits and takes a job as an assistant to Robert DeNiro's character, a fire inspector. They inspect around the fact that a lot of deaths by backdraft have been happening around the city.Okay, so the plot's a little farfetched and silly. This easily could have been a moldy TV movie or cheesy 80's flick. But it's not, thanks to great acting and explosive special effects. Most of the parts in this film are very well filled in. Baldwin is better than he usually is, DeNiro is, as always, great, Donald Sutherland is also very good in an impossibly small part, Jennifer Jason Leigh is miscast but does her best and Kurt Russell is... ermh... Kurt Russell is Kurt Russell. It would be sort of stupid not to have fire in a movie about firefighters, but Backdraft has that in spades. The fire effects are extremely realistic (unlike the rest of this movie) and well made. They are the best part of this enjoyable, sometimes memorable and often cheesy action flick. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trite dialogue and a vagueries in the subplot mar the otherwise excellent BACKDRAFT. Excellent performances by Kurt Russell, Robert DeNiro and Donald Sutherland. The arson mystery was not really necessary in this movie. I never was really clear as to how the fires were started. Apparently, the magnesium ignitor and the chemical accelerant burned up all the air in the room, but maintained enough heat and fuel so that opening the door would result in a flash fire. That's my guess. That firefighters would call this movie realistic lets me know I would never want to be one. This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. The fire effects alone are worth the "price of admission." Special note should be given to the music and cinematography. A real must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with this movie is that there is too much going on here for its own good and if some of the stupid sub-plots were eliminted, it would have been better. It's not that I don't like the film, because I do, but the romance between Baldwin and Leigh is so forced and unbelievable that I actually cringed when I watched it for the first time in about three years. Also Russell's relationship with his ex-wife is just not needed. I know in some people's minds it shows the dangers of being a fireman not just on the job but in life as well, but it just wasn't necessary. And if your'e going to have it in here, at least don't have stupid contrived scenes like the one where Russell shows up on her doorstep late at night drunk and utters lines like " It's the only thing I was ever good at " crap. Which brings me to my next and final negative point. Some of the characters are terribly developed and they are either written poorly or they just deliver their lines like they were in a play in elementary school. Honestly they are that bad sometimes. Even veteran actors can't do much with what they have to work with in some scenes.Having said all that, I do like this movie for the most part. The special effects are truly astonishing and they add to the realism and intensity of the film. And what I really liked about the film is that the end was so damned touching that I think it actually wanted guys to cry in the theater. When Russell says lines like " That's my brother ***dammit. Look at him go, " is enough to make you swell with pride. And of course when the parade graces the screen you are then given permission to lose it. Now that is powerful stuff. And for those reasons alone I recommend this film. It's just too bad that there were some amateurish elements to the film because it really could have been a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Guess If You Like Firefighters... It's One of Your Few Choices</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, if you want a firefighting movie, it's this or "Ladder 49". I'd rather watch this than some sentimental John Travolta movie capitalizing off the the post-9/11 glorification of our nation's heroes. Not that I'm really into firefighting movies, mind you... but it could be worse.What this film is, is a series of conflicts. Brother against brother. Fire department against the city alderman. Fire department against a serial arsonist. A man against his own shortcomings. And of course, man against fire. It could actually be rather intricate and beautiful if I wanted to romanticize it (which I don't). And all this with William Baldwin, Kurt Russell and Robert DeNiro.By far the best role in this movie was the old arsonist who knows "the animal" of fire inside and out. The way he acts like a pedophile with fire (rather than children) is a very convincing act. I regret I don't recall the actor's name off hand. (Note: the old arsonist and the serial arsonist are two different characters -- I'm referring to the old man with the mustache.) Jennifer Jason Leigh reportedly said the best role went to the fire. She's right in two ways. The obviously way, of course, was that the scenes with the fire were by far the most engaging and visually stimulating. But she also, probably unbeknownst to her, was the weak part of the film. Coming out in 1991, this is the cusp of the 1980s and the 1990s. All the other actors seem to know this is the 1990s but she has not converted yet. I love Leigh in the 80s ("Fast Times"), and in the 90s and 00s. But acting like its the 1980s in the 1990s is poor form (her childish demeanor and mismatch hair are so distracting). Sorry, Jen, you are the weakest link.But overall, it's a respectable film. Definitely better than some of the stuff Kurt Russell has pumped out over the years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Putting out fires in slow motion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's odd; because the fire department is probably the most exciting of the three major emergency services, yet they always seem to get the short end of the stick when it comes to movies about them. Despite a star studded cast, an experienced director and a bucket load of special effects; Backdraft is a wholly disappointing film that is as much about sentimental drama as it is about fighting fires. Ron Howard hasn't made many good films; and this one does nothing to change that. If it wasn't for the extremely silly sequence that sees Kurt Russell carrying a young kid out of a fire, the film might have been more enjoyable; but unfortunately, it is this sequence that sums the whole thing up. The plot follows a young kid, name of Brian, who watches his father die in a fire fighting accident. This would probably put me off fighting fires; but not good old Brian, as before we know he's on the same service as his older brother, and putting those fires out like a good 'un. However, in a secondary plot; there's a dangerous arsonist on the loose, who keeps burning things despite the city's requests for him to stop.I guess this sort of drivel will probably appeal more to the American market - as even though we here in Britain recognise the importance of our fire department; we also know that they don't put fires out set to corny music and in slow motion; American firemen always seem to. Ron Howard does well in wasting a good cast; as the worst actor in the film is William Baldwin, and he takes the lead role. The always entertaining Kurt Russell is dumbed down into boredom, while the talented Jennifer Jason Leigh doesn't get chance to impress. Robert De Niro is the standout (which makes a change when it comes to nineties films), and Donald's Sutherland's character - the most interesting in the film - doesn't appear for long enough. Given that this is a film about heroically putting out fires, you've got to expect a lot of heroics and fires and this film has both. Some of the special effect scenes are well handled and exciting; but some of them are corny and sentimental, and Ron Howard would have been better off entertaining his audience rather than trying to win an award for what is essentially a B-movie. Overall, Backdraft does have its moments; but it would be better if it was shorter and less corny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Backdraft is one of my all-time favorite movies, primarily for the spectacular visuals. Never before, and never since, have I seen fire given such a wonderful treatment. Horrifying, mystifying, entrancing, exciting, sensual, this film shows fire in so many wonderful ways.Fortunately, there's also some plot, writing, and performance interest to the film as well. Other films have stunning visuals ("Twister" comes to mind), but lack many of the other elements that make a good film. But "Backdraft" has these elements at least to the degree required to make the film enjoyable beyond the sheer beauty of the fire footage.10 out of 10. An outstanding visual experience.Barky</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One for the ladies as Kurt plays with his hose - 50%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years, I have been accused of watching any old crap purely for reviewing purposes. On the face of it, this seems like a pretty safe theory - even I can't think of another reason why anybody would watch garbage like "Committed", "McCinsey's Island" or "Guest House Paradiso". Thankfully, "Backdraft" isn't anywhere near as bad as those films but those accusations came flooding back as I became aware that I was completely the wrong audience type. Easily the most homo-erotic movie since "Top Gun", this is a rare action film that will appeal to women more than to men.Kurt Russell and William Baldwin plays two brothers, Stephen and Brian McCaffrey respectively, who end up working in the same fire brigade in Chicago. Stephen is a grizzled veteran, born to fight fires after following in his dead father's footsteps. Brian is cockier and more inexperienced, finally finding his way into the family profession after a string of nothing jobs. Both are fiercely competitive and end up scrapping with each other as much as burning buildings. Which is very bad news for Chicago as a crazed arsonist is on the loose, who is apparently choosing his victims at will.I'll get the good points out of the way first. Director Ron Howard has assembled a stellar cast (along with Russell and Baldwin, we have Robert De Niro, Donald Sutherland, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Rebecca De Mornay and never-the-leading-man J.T. Walsh) and all of them are surpassed by the fire itself. This is a wonderfully shot film with flames almost alive with malice, dancing across ceilings and walls and generally wrecking the set. Credit must also go to the stars who do their own stunt work. The story itself is a bit of a no-brainer and at times, this film comes across more as a comedy than anything else. Nearly all the firemen smoke (without any hint of irony) and the overall acting quality is fairly hammy, to put it mildly. Sutherland, for example, appears to serve no purpose whatsoever and when he and De Niro whisper their way through an entire scene, I couldn't help but giggle.Like I said, this is strictly one of the ladies. Kurt and William do their pretty-boys-in-uniform routine, right down to the naked shower scene and the hilarious scene when they are cooling themselves off with their hoses... so to speak. All they needed a bit of beach volleyball and they're away! Mind you, I can't imagine Chicago being that sort of place. Other things also raise a smile at unfortunate moments. The best bit, for me, was seeing little Brian (Ryan Todd) pick up his dad's still-smoking helmet as he watched his dad go up in smoke, bottom lip quivering like a scolded puppy! One almost expected to see a pair of rubber boots standing to attention, smoke rising from the top! The first victim to the arsonist's reign of terror is blown from his front door through his car windscreen and so badly burned, you'd think he's an eyewitness to the Hiroshima atom bomb! It's almost as if Howard is trying to inject some humour when none is needed, to break up the shots of Kurt leaping through flames with a baby in his arms. Predictable, a waste of a good cast and not worth the effort - "ER" is a much better emergency-services-in-Chicago broadcast than "Backdraft" and men and women can enjoy that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special Effects Makes It Mildly Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My father was a fire fighter, so when I was growing up I spent a great deal of time hanging around the fire station. And virtually any one who knows anything at all about fire fighting will tell you this is one of the most completely unrealistic films you could ever hope to see. Fire fighters rush into burning yet strangely smokeless rooms with their coats flapping open and without the proper safety equipment, and in spite of the title's implication the phenomena they are talking about is called "flashover," not "backdraft." In fact, there are so many inaccuracies in this film that a grad student could probably catalogue them as a doctoral thesis.All this having been said, BACKDRAFT is the well-crafted but essentially superficial film typical of director Ron Howard: everything is very, very slick and looks good on the screen, particularly the male leads. The story itself concerns two brothers (Kurt Russell and William Baldwin) who somehow find themselves employed by the same unit and who must bury their differences to combat a wily arsonist with the aid of their able Lieutenant (Robert De Niro) and a flaky adviser who knows about pyromaniacs since he himself used to be one (Donald Sutherland.) The cast is good, the script is mechanical, and the plot is improbable--but all of this is actually beside the point, because everything about the film exists only as an excuse for lots of special effects.And it is here that the film finally gets good marks. The pyrotechnics are great, and the film actually manages to create the impression of an out-of-control fire as something akin to a ravening beast--very impressive, and often as not more than a little unnerving. And so for once the fire, not the fire fighters, saves the day by making the film mildly enjoyable. If you can ignore the inaccuracies and take the film as a special effects film akin to the likes of VOLCANO, which had an equally silly premise, you'll probably enjoy it. Just don't expect to come out of it with even a remote idea of how fire fighters actually work. Final thought: rent it first, because one time through will probably be enough.Gary F.

So what if it has a few corny lines - it has a good story, spectacular action, perfect casting, humour and pathos. The real star of the show, though, is the score by Hans Zimmer (of Crimson Tide fame). The score is absolutely superb, especially the funeral scenes, the ringing of the bell and the closing titles. There are also some great shots of the hardware - the famous 'blacktops'. In today's cynical world, so what if a movie brings a lump to your throat. It was a good story well told. So I give it 10 out of 10 for the reasons stated and it goes in my collection.</fullReview>

I think this film should have more attention that is has received over the years which I believe it is one of the best movies and with top notch performances by Kurt Russell, William Baldwin, Robert De Niro, Donald Sutherland, and Scott Glenn and plus the superb score by genius composer Hans Zimmer and great direction by Ron Howard!

		<shortDescription>Drags On For Too Long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William Baldwin and Kurt Russell played two firefighter brothers in this movie that whilst it had it's moments, dragged on for too long.There was a great cast in the film but frustratingly, a lot of them were not given much time or much to do. Perhaps it is unwise to have so many top stars in one film without neglecting the talents of them all.William Baldwin is annoying at times and Kurt Russell's character is the one I found myself supporting throughout the film. He was convincing in his role as a Fire Department Lieutenant.The explosions themselves were not really anything spectacular and some of the procedures used whilst fighting the fires are totally unrealistic. I do know a bit about the Fire Service and let's just say that these guys were not following the proper health and safety procedures in the film. I must give credit to the final fire at the end though, it was pretty damn good.Robert De Niro plays a Fire Investigator in it but I didn't think he was given enough screen time and that the film could have benefitted by giving him more to do.Oh and by the way, there is the odd red herring to the identity of the arsonist but it isn't that hard to spot if you're concentrating.I wouldn't go as far as to call this film bad but it did outstay it's welcome and drag on a bit too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts out with our main character, as a boy, seeing his father's smoking fire helmet land at his feet, and things just go downhill from there. Hokey dialog, poor direction, unbelievable over-acting. I guess this is what you get from a director who never rose above his Happy Days roots. The scene where Kurt Russel was posing his way through a roof repair while arguing with his estranged wife was bad, the habit those guys had of entering burning buildings without oxygen, and with their jackets open just plain unrealistic; and doesn't Chicago ever have minor fires, or false alarms, or any of the other trivial calls that don't involve an entire city block and a creepy guy who sets fires for fun?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An explosive film that lacks some spark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw the DVD of Backdraft available at the local entertainment store, I was not at all interested in watching it because of my naive mind-set that "firefighters are boring". But then I found out that Jennifer Jason Leigh (one of my all-time favorite actresses) starred in the movie, so I decided to buy the DVD and give the film a chance.After seeing the movie, I was mildly impressed by its spectacular fire special effects. I had never seen a film that focuses on fire as much as this one. The strong focus on fire kept me interested throughout the movie, as I had never known that firefighters had to put up with so much fire problems in their daily lives.The movie has a great all-star cast, ranging from Kurt Russell to Donald Sutherland to Jennifer Jason Leigh. All these familiar Hollywood faces will surely appeal to movie lovers and keep them interested until the end of the movie.I loved seeing Jennifer Jason Leigh's post-Fast Times at Ridgemont High acting skills. Her character in Backdraft was beautiful and fascinating, and her relationship with William Baldwin's character was clearly shown.This brings me to the problems I had with this movie. First of all, Jennifer's character never interacts with any character except William Baldwin's character. This really got on my nerves because I wanted to see her be a main character in this movie. She had so much potential to be a strong character in the film.Another problem is the movie's long running time. In my opinion, the film did not need to be 2 hours longs. There were some scenes that could have been deleted to keep the film moving better at its fast pace. After all, this film IS classified as a thriller, and thrillers should never be too long because you would get too tired to follow the plot twists &amp; turns.Overall, Backdraft is an above-average thriller that gives some focus on the issue of firefighting and the problems they have to face in their lives battling fires. But to tell the truth, the movie is not for everyone. It will mostly likely appeal only to real-life firefighters and fans of the all-star cast.I give this film a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>movie tend to sensationalize when they depict firefighters and policeman. if they showed what fireman and police officers did from day to day, it would bore you to tears. no one would pay to see a police officer telling a neighbor to turn his music down or want to see a fireman spend three hours working a car fire. the one thing that does bother me is when a cop on TV walks around with his finger on the trigger. YOU DO NOT PUT YOUR FINGER ON THE TRIGGER UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO SHOOT. you put your finger outside along the side. AND I AM A COP. it's not 24 hours of fun. our jobs have a dull repetitiveness to them. i have arrested one guy 13 times. i hate when people make comments when they don't know anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing new, nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main problem with Hollywood is that it is always looking for new heroes. Even though this movie has been made 10 years before 9/11, it just feels like it was made after the events. Since some retarded president (I guess I don't have to say his name, you know all to well who I mean) said that the firefighters and policemen who died in New York were real "heroes", the studios seem to think that we need these role models to make our own lives better and more useful for the community. Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying it is a good thing that these people died, certainly not, but these people only did and do their job, just like you and me. The story is predictable. A young boy has seen his dad, who was a fireman, die in a fire. Of course he wants to become a fireman himself when he's old enough, but it isn't always easy. All kind of people try to convince him in different ways not to become a fireman, but our hero goes on and gradually wins everybody's respect. Oh yeah, at the end of the movie some of the main characters (one is his brother) also die in a tragic way...Hollywood's biggest problem is that much isn't enough. They always want to make things bigger, better and more glamorous than they actually are, and this movie is no exception. It's a typical Hollywood popcorn drama. Not that such movie are always awful, when done in the right way, such movies can really work. But this time it doesn't really connect the way I would like to see it. Yes, you get some nice slow motions with a touching tune in the background, a story about who the real heroes are... but in the end it offers really nothing new. You've seen it before and you'll see it many times in the future. I give it a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After growing up in a firefighting house hold, the first thing I noticed about this movie were all the goofs that the firemen in the film did vs what goes on in real life. Anyway, with all that aside, Backdraft is good for entertainment values. But if you are thinking on becoming a fire fighter and watch this movie, trust me when I say this isn't even close to how it's done in real life.Billy Baldwin and Kurt Russell put in a convincing performance of feuding brothers who grow up to be firemen themselves. Donald Sutherland also shines as the resident pyromaniac, Ronald. All in all, it's a good film that is worth seeing.--SC</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Action film, rather unrealistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Backdraft completes its goal of being a Hollywood blockbuster starring Kurt Russel as an angry authority figure. However, from a firefighter's point of view, this movie falls drastically short of anything resembling realistic. Although fire, more or less, behaves in the way depicted in the movie (i.e. the smoke recessing under the door as every last bit of oxygen in the room is consumed, and the explosion after introducing a fresh oxygen source to the), a firefighter would never enter a burning building with an open jacket, an unstrapped helmet, without protective pants, and ESPECIALLY without a self-contained breathing apparatus (air pack). This is not only against every occupational hazard law ever written, it is deadly. This is only the beginning of a list of several flagrant inconsistencies with proper firefighting guidelines, but unfortunately, a properly dressed and safe firefighter isn't heroic in the Hollywood sense, so Ron Howard had to take some creative liberties with reality. 2/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too bad about the story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is filled with beautiful images and moments, too bad that the story is far from interesting."Backdraft" possibly has the best scene's with fire in it ever. The scene's with fire are truly beautiful mainly because the fire is treated as a living breathing thing with a will of it's own. Fire is actually a very beautiful thing, too bad it's just so dangerous and deadly.The beginning is truly wonderful and actually one of my all time favorites mainly because of the most excellent music by Hans Zimmer. However right after the wonderful beginning the movie becomes slow and kind of dull and only really becomes interesting when fires occur.The main problem is the story, it simply isn't interesting enough and only works distracting. It has a nice brother-relation story in it though, but it can't save the story. Also the ending is way too much over the top, beautiful but just too much over the top.The cast is solid and full with big names. Kurt Russell, Scott Glenn and J.T. Walsh are excellent however Robert De Niro and Donald Sutherland are given pretty ungrateful roles and are a waste of talent and opportunity to make the story a whole lot more interesting or at least more convincing.Still the fire scene's makes up surprising much and they alone make this movie more then worth to watch. They are really very spectacular!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Okay story about firemen, their fights amongst themselves, their loved ones and - oh yeah - the fires themselves. Stunning visual effects with the conflagrations truly the stars of the film (which won an Oscar for its category) and one standout scene of slightly hammy acting between firebug Sutherland and arson expert De Niro.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1991 Universal release is a rare letdown in Robert DeNiro's career but since he's not the top billed star I won't let this film's disaster count against him. Kurt Russell and William Baldwin are the starring victims though. This ridiculous film has to do with a group of Chicago firemen going up against a mysterious arsonist. Not even the detailed fire sequences can save this film from being all burned up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so mind blowingly unrealistic I really don't even know where to begin. It's a wonder the firefighters were able to survive this long, rushing into fires with their bunker coats open and wearing no breathing apparatus.Also, the fire in this movie seems to be magical fire from Hollywood Land that isn't very hot at all and produces no smoke whatsoever, allowing the insides of badly burning buildings to be crystal clear and NOT completely pitch black with smoke like real fire, which also allows the firefighters to survive without a problem with no breathing masks.It's a not bad action movie if you ignore all that though, I suppose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was shown on cable a few weeks ago, and I decided to watch it, because Ron Howard(Cocoon, Apollo 13) is one of my favorite directors. Suprisingly I sat through the whole thing without dozing off. The movie was very predictable, and very boring most of the time. The special effects withthe fires were pretty good, and the acting is pretty good,which almost makes up for the bad script, but it doesnt. I would have expected much better from a great director like Ron Howard. I'll be generous, and give this film ** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as Tinker Tailor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been an avid Happy Days fan since the episode where Robin Williams appeared as Mork, I was very disappointed that director Richie Cunningham (AKA The Howitzer) did not appear, along with the Fonz, Ralph Malph, Potsie Weber, Howard Cunningham, Marion Cunningham, Joanie Cunningham, Al Delvecchio and Chachi - although there is a moment of fire-inspired tension where Kurt Russell bears an uncanny resemblance to Ralph Malph's father (who appears in episode 237, first broadcast May 1976 - not shown in the Granada region).The special effects in this 'movie' were disappointing to say the least. To add dramatic tension to my cinematic experience, I was forced to liberally douse my anus with brandy and get my partner (who vaguely looks like Potsie Weber playing tennis on a waterlogged hard court surface) to light it - thereby creating our own unique back draft. I shall love her forever, although the by now sweaty people sitting next to us in the cinema complained about the lack of a Daikin EUW-KZW (13-395KW) air conditioning unit.The ending is pure vaudeville - I loved the way that Robert De Niro was eaten by a surprising invasion of robotic Velcro tarantulas, who screamed "masticate, masticate" as the friendly-faced spidery fiends munched on his privates and beyond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good &amp; Bad Of 'Backdraft'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an entertaining movie with some awesome action scenes but has so much other garbage to it, that it ruined the film for me.THE GOOD - The fire scenes are tremendous, the best I've ever seen on film. It's hard to believe this movie came over more than 15 years ago, but these scenes and special-effects are not dated, by any means. They make for some unique and very tense moments. The sound that goes with the fire also is extremely interesting. It's a good cast, too - just look at those names.THE BAD - Way too much stupid dialog, mostly by Kurt Russell who was still in his super macho-man mentality stage of his career, playing profane, ultra-tough guys in many of his films. (He's slowed down and mellowed quite a bit now, thankfully). Also, the constant arguments between "Bull McCaffrey" (Russell) and his brother "Brian" William Baldwin) grates on the viewer after awhile. Then, there is the ridiculous view of fire as literally being alive and human-like. Are you serious? Only Hollywood could come up with New Age-type nonsense like that, which is insulting to any viewer with a brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Backdraft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard of this film a few times, and I knew it involved fires and the fire brigade, I also had an idea of one of the lead stars, but did not know it was a near all star cast, I was going to watch whatever, from director Ron Howard (Splash, The Paper, A Beautiful Mind, The Da Vinci Code). Basically Brian McCaffrey (William Baldwin, Alec and Stephen's brother) was a child when he witnessed his fireman father Dennis (Kurt Russell), and after trying to get other jobs elsewhere he has become a fire fighter himself, joining brother Stephen 'Bull' (also Russell). They do not exactly have the best relationship, but in the heat of the moment, or rather the flames of the buildings, they have to work together to put out the fires and save any people trapped. Brian had his picture taken when he was just a boy, and it became an award winning cover for Life magazine, and having got his picture taken again he is praised as a hero mistakingly. A politician offers him a job as arson investigator for the department, working under Donald 'Shadow' Rimgale (Robert De Niro), because recently a string of fires have been caused by someone who manages to create fires that only blaze more when doors are opened, called backdraft. For a while he refuses to work in this new job role, but too many confrontations with brother Bull leads him to change his mind, and these arson fires are still going on with no leads as of yet. The brothers do eventually make up again and fight a fire together, but Stephen is mortally wounded, rescued out of the large blaze by Brian, and he dies on the way to hospital, they have a department funeral for him and other victim John 'Axe' Adcox (Scott Glenn). In the end we find out that the arsonist is the man trying to be mayor Alderman Marty Swayzak (Pleasantville's J.T. Walsh) who was gaining politically from the deaths of firefighters, and Brian vows to continue as a firefighter. Also starring Jennifer Jason Leigh as Jennifer Vaitkus, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle's Rebecca De Mornay as Helen McCaffrey, Jason Gedrick as Tim Krizminski, Donald Sutherland as Ronald Bartel, Anthony Mockus Sr. as Chief John Fitzgerald, Cedric Young as Grindle, Juan Ramírez as Ray Santos, Kevin Casey as Nightingale, Jack McGee as Schmidt and Mark Wheeler as Pengelly. The casting of Baldwin, Russell and De Niro are all very well done, but to be honest the only thing to really take notice of are the fantastic fire sequences, the use of colour and camera angles as the flames roar and rush through the buildings is a real wonder for the eyes, the arson story is okay as well, a watchable action drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally saw Backdraft, and was let down....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've wanted to see this movie for so long, but never got around to it. I finally got the chance to see it, and......I expected a much better film. Kurt Russell and William Baldwin are okay as battling brothers. Once again the veteran actors outshine everyone else...De Niro as the arson investigator, and Donald Sutherland (in an unusual turn as a crazed arsonist) were great. The special effects with the fires was pretty cool to watch, you could say that the fire is the true star of the film. Ron Howard just didn't execute this quite right; something just seemed to be missing...I can't help but feel that this movie could've been so much better. What absolutely KILLED the experience for me was what has to go down in history as one of the corniest, lamest lines in film HISTORY! Said Kurt Russell when his brother is battling the enormous fire in the end, "Look at him, that's my brother GODDAMMIT!" Jesus, was that actually WRITTEN in the script? It doesn't get any worse than that. I waited a long time to see this, and it was a big disappointment. Could've been much better.** out of **** stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contains Too Many Elements Tobe a Total Success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to seeing BACKDRAFT when it was released . I'd actually spent a couple of days training with the fire brigade up in Aberdeen as part of my North sea survival certificate ( To work off shore on the rigs you must pass the course ) and had an inkling as to the courage and dangers of fire fighting and this movie is an unrepentant tribute to firemen . as for the trailers I'd seen it looked like an exciting film and the cast alone was a good enough reason to track it down . Come on you've got Deniro and Sutherland in the same movie along with established talent like Russell and Glenn and a few other nearly stars in Baldwin , De Mornay and Leigh but after seeing it I felt disappointed and it becomes increasingly disappointing the more often you see it one problem is the rather clichéd directing by Ron Howard . Look at the large number of scenes that are filmed in slow motion which would later become parodied in commercials . Interestingly enough this type of visual style has been copied to a fault by Michael Bay who is universally regarded as being the worst A list director in Hollywood over the last few years . You also can't help noticing that despite there being no smoke without fire , that fire with no smoke often makes an appearance But it's the script that's the main problem with umpteen elements and subplots brought into play . We have a double subplot with Brian McCaffrey who is having stress put on his marriage by his job while also coming into conflict with his brother which gives the film a very soap operish feel and it's often unbearably sentimental . We also have a mystery style plot involving an arsonist . Who's starting these fires and why ? Obviously this is important to the plot but when you've seen BACKDRAFT you find out who is behind it and why therefore there's little in the movie to hold your attention for repeated viewings</fullReview>
