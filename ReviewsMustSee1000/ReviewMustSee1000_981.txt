		<shortDescription>Perfect Movie-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An undisputed classic that chronicles every appalling moment of a drunken night in hell as middle-aged George and Martha tear each other, and their guest, to pieces.Elizabeth Taylor proves categorically that she was a truly great actress. Her Oscar-winning performance as the psychologically tormented Martha is one of the greatest performances in the history of cinema. Taylor's imperceptible shifting from sadism to tenderness, from bullying condescension to exhausted vulnerability, is a masterclass in character building. Martha is a truly monstrous character, and yet Taylor is able to imbue her with sympathy, allowing you brief glimpses of the warm and lovable woman she could have been.Richard Burton is equally magnificent as George; an ageing, failing college professor whose initial meekness gives way to a raging torment all of his own. His verbal sparring with Taylor, like two pit-bulls in the ring of an endless and bloody dogfight, has become legendary. Every word drips with malice and contempt, every sentence is designed to cut the deepest wound. At times, it becomes painful to watch, but like true train-wreck television, you cannot drag yourself away from the inevitably terrible conclusion.Quite possibly, this is as close to perfect as movies can get; beautifully written dialogue, deeply complex characters, an evolving and suspenseful storyline, beautiful photography, and a wonderfully understated score by Alex North. Nominated for 13 Academy Awards in 1967, but lost out to A Man for All Seasons and Born Free to win only 5."Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" "I am."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still powerful, harrowing view of the "Anti-Ozzie and Harriet"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is still an exceptional film from the 1960s. Though some of the epithets are obviously softening much stronger words, the language is frank and brutal, Martha's bludgeoning body-blows balanced by George's icepick thrusts. Edward Lehman's respectful screenplay gently opens up Edward Albee's one-set play while keeping a certain claustrophobic atmosphere. Mike Nichols' first directing effort is stunning in its lack of artifice; rarely do you feel that the director has done much more than turn on the camera and watch four actors, all at the top of their game, tear into their roles. George Segal's work in this movie is criminally underrated, but his reactive work as studly, ultimately disappointing Nick should be mandatory study by all young actors. Sandy Dennis' fluttery turn as mousy, wifey Honey is powerful also; a lot more is going on than you might think. Richard Burton is staggering as George ("Georgie Porgie Put-upon Pie"), and his performance demonstrates the magic that he could bring to a worthy role. Elizabeth Taylor's work here still astounds. The physical transformation she undertook to become aging harpy Martha is amazing enough, but her performance seems to channel a hurricane's force and fury. By turns hilarious, maddening and then, at the end, exhausted and defeated yet again, Taylor demonstrates acting, particularly film acting, at its best. The film is by no means easy or "Hollywood" in feel-- the audience is as exhausted as the characters at the end. But this was a bracing, necessary antidote to the impossible ideal of marriage usually portrayed in the movies. A towering film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's what comes from too much alcohol and too few mutual respect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' tells the story of two couples that are quite different at first sight - one used to each other for years, the other one rather freshly wed in comparison. Actually it doesn't tell their story, but it displays their relationships. The film begins on a Sunday morning at 2 o'clock, right after a party, and ends just after the sun rises. In these few hours we get to know these four people better then we might possibly want. George and Martha are the older couple. He is a history professor, she is the daughter of the head of the university. Their relationship seems to be from hell, full of mutual disgust and humiliation. Their guests are Nick and Honey. He is the new, ambitious biology professor, she is his naive young wive. As all these four characters are more or less drunk throughout the entire film, alcohol works as a catalyst, and we quickly see the different kind of character traits they have: George is a cynic, Martha loves to torment her husband, Nick is an opportunist and Honey is very much a stupid blonde. The two relationships deserve closer examination: We wonder why Martha and George married in the first place. They keep swearing at each other. Martha can't stop humiliating George, when they are alone as well as when Nick and Honey are there. Maybe there is still a rest of love in them, but there mutual respect has vanished completely. And then there is the strange story of their son, who is supposed to visit on his birthday. They way George and Martha talk about him make us feel that there is something peculiar about him. At the end we get to know more about him, and we can only guess how important the son is for their relationship. Nick and Honey, on the other hand, seem to be quite the opposite. But, being used as weapons by the older couple, we see that their relationship isn't as perfect as it seems to be, either. Nick didn't marry Honey because he loved her, but because he thought she was pregnant and because of her money. And when Martha tries to seduce him to tease George, he plays the game with her, always in mind that this woman's father is the head of the university. Honey, on the other hand, is much more emotional than her husband, but she also is the most passive character, and the one most affected by the alcohol. Mike Nichols assembled an outstanding cast for his film. Casting Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as Martha and George is a stroke of genius - not only are they terrific actors, but it also heats the imagination of the viewer how much their real-life-marriage resembled the relationship they had in this film. Elizabeth Taylor outshines her co-stars a little. Never was she any better than in this one; although her character is the meanest in the film, she manages that we still feel compassion for her at the end. But Richard Burton, George Segal and especially Sandy Dennis deliver memorable performances, too. 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' succeeds at something rather difficult: It makes us care for characters we wouldn't want to have anything to do with in real life. And although it actually consist of nothing but four people talking for two hours, it never bored us for a second.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Distilled Human Viciousness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ailing couple George (Burton) and Martha (Taylor) invite a young couple over for a late-night drink - much to quiet and repressed George's annoyance - and what starts off as a twisted game by sultry Martha to annoy her husband and get her way with young stud Nick (George Segal) ends up in a horrific duel of wits.Adapted from the play and boasting very few locations, "Virginia Woolf" is notable for many unsuspected reasons. Designed for the stage, the film makes the story uniquely cinematic and tense, amped up by stunning photography (in Black and White, a daring choice in 1966). The younger leads are superb, but Burton and Taylor still manage to walk away with film, giving stunning renditions of the world's most demented couple. They make the surreal dialogue hurt and touch in ways never thought possible.Though there are countless reasons to recommend this jewel of a film, there are also reasons why one would wish to avoid it. This is the kind of film that makes you feel like having a showing (or a very concentrated drink) to wash away the grit and human evil and pain absorbed. You'll feel dirty, but in a way you'll also feel enlightened: that a small character film can carry more punch than any explosion-packed blockbuster out there is a thing of beauty indeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best acting you'll ever see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who's afraid of Virgina Wolf? contains what I would call the most outstanding old school actor/audience experience I'ver ever seen. This movie is 131 minutes long and only contains 5 actors, on of which hardly gets any screen time and the two leading characters played by the famous couple Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor are on screen almost the whole time. Also this movie only contains a couple of locations so the whole project depends almost entirely on these two actors superb performance. The two of them fight almost the entire movie and it never gets boring for a second. Well, I gave this movie ten stars..... definitely a classic must see if you're interested in acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, this is one of my favourite films of all time. Great acting, great writing and great camerawork make this close to cinematic perfection. Liz Taylor and Richard Burton give the performances of their lives. Sandy Dennis also shines in an early-ish role. It's a dramatic film, but the wicked humour that permeates the film is absolutely devastating, and I mean that in the best possible way. Many moments in the film I find myself laughing only to think, "Should I be laughing at this." Certainly the film is loaded with uncomfortable moments, enhanced by the camerawork replete with uneasy close-ups. Most of all, this film shows how a lot can be accomplished with just a little: a cast of four and minimal scenery changes. "Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf" has become an absolute icon of American cinema. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply put: fascinating.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard for me to accept a film as perfect. This is partly because of IMDb ? the movie ranked highest on the Top 250 list ('The Godfather') has a mere 9.0, meaning there is ten points worth of things wrong with even the best film ever made. What IMDb voters fail to realize is that if a movie has an intention ? a purpose ? and it serves that purpose effortlessly and hits every note that it's supposed to hit without even the remotest hint of an off key, it is perfect by its own right, and therefore worthy of a ten out of ten. 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' is one of those movies.The plot is ecstatically simple: a troubled married couple (Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton) has a younger and ? we assume ? happier couple (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) over late at night for quick drinks. The reason for the get together is that Martha's (Taylor) father runs the university where George (Burton) and Nick (Segal) work, and the father told them to 'be nice' to the younger couple, so Martha invited them over for a late party. Like I said, the plot is simple, but the characters are so deep and complex it'd take a whole lot more than 1,000 words to describe them correctly (but I'll try with what I got).The film starts with George and Martha coming home from a late party. Both are drunk (Martha is a loud and obnoxious drunk but George just has a headache) and Martha constantly berates George when he fails to come up with the name of the Bette Davis movie she's thinking of (and dozens other reasons). It's early in the movie so we don't know if her insults are for real or if they're just a way of being playful with her husband. George acts to stone faced that we can't tell if he's being hurt or played with.It's when Nick and Honey (Sandy Dennis) come over that we get to really see how George feels. Martha insults him, calls him names, yells at him while Nick and Sandy look on, baffled as to whether they should laugh or not. As the insults keep on coming George's anger and hurt grow, and the tensions reach a high when he takes a rifle from the closet, points it at Martha and fires. But surprise! It's just a toy with an umbrella that shoots out of the barrel.As the movie goes on the characters get drunker, angrier and some painful secrets are revealed, and the actors never lose focus. Burton is sort of disintegrating in front of our eyes, both physically and emotionally, from the drink and his wife. He starts off rigid and unbreakable but soon turns cruel and sadistic, while still keeping his sort of suave, charming personality.Taylor won an Oscar for playing Martha, and it was an Oscar well deserved. At the beginning she looks like the most vile, unlikable character, but as thick layers are torn away we get to see the hurt and pain her character feels from years of berating George. She loves him, she says, but she doesn't deserve him because of how horrible she is. She doesn't want to be happy, but she does at the same time. We feel for this woman because she is a person, not a caricature of a drunken wife. From when we first see him we know that there is more to Nick than meets the eye. He seems, in a way, sort of ashamed and embarrassed of his goofy wife, and doesn't put up much of a fight when Martha makes advances on him ? right in front of Honey's eyes. Of course, he's not just the clichéd hotshot character of so many movies either. He has an agenda he feels he needs to use to further his career, but he doesn't like using it. He says early that he doesn't like to get involved in other's problems, and gets increasingly awkward and uncomfortable as the movie progresses. Nick also thinks he's the only sane one in the whole house, even insulting his own wife.Sandy Dennis' Honey seems like the smallest character of the film, but her work is in the background. Watch the movie twice, and focus only on her the second time. She reacts; she is always the character who's reacting, never in control. And she has the hard task of acting like a drunken moron for the majority of the film, a task that she excels at. But she only appears as an idiot, she knows what's going on around her but she denies it and tries to act like a playful child to rid herself of the horribleness that's happening. None of this is spoken, of course, but we see it in her face. She won her Oscar for the movie too, and deserved it.This is a horrifying film of the dangers of the lies we tell ourselves (with other themes, too, like alcoholism and marriage). It is a perfect film. Few have reached this equality of tragedy, drama, suspense and dark comedy. A recommendation to all, no one could turn away this film.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>probably one of the best arguments for why AA should exist; volatile, overwrought drama at its richest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf leaves no scabs or stones unturned with the characters. George and Martha are a couple who have a marriage that is truly love-hate. They can never be called too unemotional, though to say whether or not they're being truthful at all in the 'games' they play with married Nick and Honey is a little trickier. Martha invited them- at her father's insistence (he IS the chairman of the university where George and Nick are professors)- at two in the morning for a quick drink. Or rather, make that many drinks, like chain drinking, if one could call it that, where George and Martha prove themselves as pros in that area, with bitter slinging of enraged bouts of bile at one or the other. This goes on the rest of the night, also leading to a roadhouse on the way to drive a flustered Nick and hammered Honey home, and then it starts all over again, with Nick and Honey picking up the tortured and, as well, fractured personalities of this middle-aged couple. Bitter, enraptured, hateful, and, in a way, also sort of filling a void, George and Martha become two of the most powerful characters in modern drama.Edward Albee's play is full of the kind of stinging dialog that made it controversial in the 1960s, and today it still retains its potential for hitting its characters on to the audience in a shockingly overwrought and, in connection with this, very funny manner. How can one not cringe and give a laugh of relief/perplexity when George goes to get a shotgun after getting p-o'd by Martha and then opening it up to everyone's shock as... an umbrella! There's a dementia to these characters, but it's one that makes for the kind of drama that is lacerating and, as off-putting as the guessing game that the son element becomes in the equation (dead or not dead?), it somehow works. This was before most dramas of today, which are made with that big colossal twist that suddenly jolts the characters into perspective. Here, it just makes them more human and fallible and deconstructed. As Mike Nichols directs it, he doesn't shy from getting personal with his angles, close and intrinsic as, in a weird way comparable with, Bergman's Persona, also released that year.What Nichols and Albee present for audiences is a logical next step following other plays from before them that broke ground from the likes of Miller, Beckett and, especially, Williams- it's more adult, or rather more for mature audiences (the first quasi rated R movie ever released), and it hits to a cynical nerve that was further gestating by this time in America, that everything would not be alright in the American marriage, that something, as Martha says, will "SNAP!" It should also be mentioned, acting here is classic, fearless. Burton and Taylor have rarely been as good as they are at digging so deep into these characters that, especially with Burton, we can't imagine these people being anyone else. It takes a little to get used to Segal and Sandy Dennis (the latter because her character isn't quite as "deep" as the others), but then again their characters are the uncomfortable outsiders, "us" as one might say (however, as the play peels the layers away from the characters they're all rotten and ultimately very vulnerable instead of just "normal").It packs a punch, it jiggles its little glass full of bourbon or brandy or gin, and as a first feature from its director it could only get better from here. It's a dangerously fun, dangerously emotionally violent picture. Will look forward to seeing it next time it's on TV</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most powerfully written and acted movies I have ever seen. I was emotionally drained at the end and could not imagine how actors could have done this on Broadway night after night. The terrible verbal inhumanities Taylor and Burton inflicted on each other were done so well, one never knew what was truth and what was game. A must see if you can handle such a well acted but emotionally traumatic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edward Albee's award winning play, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ran for 664 performances on Broadway and just closed down when this film version made its debut in 1966. The Broadway play was set entirely in the living room of George and Martha's home and starred Uta Hagen, Arthur Hill, Melinda Dillon, and George Grizzard. All eminently respectable players, but none of them exactly movie box office.This film was destined to make money when the most publicized couple of the decade, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, chose it as a star vehicle for themselves. Of course what was not clear was how well a one stage play would adapt to film.It adapted very well and went quite beyond one stage. The action of the film moved effortlessly to an all night diner at one point with some stops along the way. You'd hardly know the story as originally told only had one setting.There's no real plot to it. For reasons I can't fathom this middle aged and bitter couple George and Martha have a younger couple, Nick and Honey, over to their house at two in the morning. I don't know about you, but I'm usually not my best at that time. Also they had just come from a party at Martha's father's house. Martha's dad is the president of a college and George teaches there. Nick and Honey are a newly hired professor and his wife.The late night and the liquor bring out the worst in everybody. A whole lot of ugly truths get told.Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf was the summit of the professional team of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Playing against type, Elizabeth Taylor got her second Oscar the one she felt she earned. She always disparaged the one received for Butterfield 8 as it came on the heels of her well publicized pneumonia bout.In fact all four members of the cast were nominated with Sandy Dennis winning Best Supporting Actress. Ironically Richard Burton didn't win, losing to Paul Scofield for A Man for All Seasons. I guess the Academy voters figured Burton would get another shot. He never brought home the big prize though.George Segal usually gets overlooked. This film and Ship of Fools was the start of his long career, but no Oscar for him either.Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is quite the indictment against marriage, especially after the love has died. It's far from the whole story of marriage. There are many who stay married longer than George and Martha and happily. But it wasn't in Edward Albee's life experience to draw from. But this should be seen to see Liz and Dick at their very best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flop, dump, or braying donkey?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It could be great and is braying for a remake so it's more than an interesting art school film seen by a tiny audience. A film you keep waiting to begin until you realize it's not going to. You won't be the only ones asking if you can go now by the time this film ends. I guess the director/writer deserves some recognition for the indirect, internal reference to itself as a flop.The title connection to the story is either extremely limited and painfully unimaginative or the writer/director assumes a great deal. One of the many things that will leave you asking, "Was that all there was to it?" For future filmmakers, a film should not need to be explained. It is the nature of a film, or a play as this is based on, that being enclosed from the rest of the world and uninterrupted that it should explain and give context to itself. Woolf massively fails this most basic aspect. It partially makes up for it in other ways, like deep relationship, marriage, and family insights, which is why I'm not rating it a 1.The score is exceptional and simple, but the soundtrack music is, at best, less annoying than the story.Compared to another film that, like this, is essentially composed of a room full of people less than happy with each other, it reinforces how great 12 Angry Men is, despite being done a decade before Woolf. A recent film, Compliance (2012), does it much better and also works with hard to believe dumb/naive characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its hard to explain how I felt about this film. I didn't particularly love it and at time found the dialog to go on and on, but I couldn't stop watching and wondering just what was going on. For a movie that only takes place in about four different places there house outside the house, the bar, and outside the bar, there was a lot going on. There was this awkward couple with tons of problems and a younger couple, they seem to playing with as a sort of game.This film had this dark creepy aspect to it, without ever really showing to many creepy parts except when George pulls out the fake gun and pretend to shoot Martha with they all find hilarious which just add to the whole creepy factor this film has going for it. I found this all interesting and wanted to found out more but I just didn't find it entertaining which I feel is the main job a movie has. I though Martha and George both were great and very convinces actors but at time Martha was just a little to over the top with her drunken antics. I have no idea why anyone who had couldn't have a child would accuse each other of killing it. Not the mention why wasn't George just as intoxicated as the rest, I found many inconstancy's in the whole drunk aspect, at certain points it seemed as they would just snap out of being drunk then go back into it. I think the fact it only involved four characters and I have no idea why anyone who had couldn't have a child would accuse each other of killing it played into why I wasn't entertained by this film, but I though it was well done maybe just not my taste</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly unpleasant...like a two-hour plus root canal without the Novocaine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those special movies that manages to be good but unwatchable at the same time. In other words, while the script may be an accurate of the most unpleasant couple in history as they spend an evening entertaining some annoying guests, some (like me) might wonder why anyone would want to see this! For example, they could film a brilliantly executed heart transplant or the removal of giant parasitical worms from someone, but why watch it? To me, the film was just too painful to endure.Liz Taylor and Richard Burton play a couple of drunks who are married and spend all their time destroying each other. Now, according to the film it's because of the death of their son but they would have been terrible people regardless--they truly despise each other and themselves. Then, as if an afterthought, some guests arrive and actually stay and watch as this couple destroy each other right in front of them. And so, the newcomers get drunk and the drunks get drunker. Wow...now THAT'S fun! Then, tongues loosen some more and a lot of unpleasantness results.Sure, having worked with alcoholics I understand that Taylor and Burton did an excellent job here. But for a two-hour plus film it's an endurance contest I don't wish to do again. So the overall verdict is that it's well made but thoroughly awful. If you can endure and appreciate this, fine. But if you can't, don't feel like you must. Just because it's rated so highly on IMDb does not mean it's a "must-see"--especially because this film may well leave you feeling depressed and in need of a drink!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun And Games With George And Martha.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a play with only four characters and basically one setting, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" covers a lot of ground. It mostly depends on the performances and the acidic dialog because, when you get right down to it, the Big Reveal isn't too big although it's plenty bizarre.George (Burton) is an associate professor of history at a small college. He doesn't have much in the way of ambition, we gather, because his shrewish and vulgar wife Martha (Taylor) keeps twitting him about it. Taylor is magnificently slatternly. She'd played Cleopatra a few years earlier but age cannot wither nor custom stale her infinite vulgarity.George and Martha have two late-night guests, a newly arrived professor of biology (Segal) and his naive wife (Dennis). The evening begins with the four of them sitting around the living room with nothing special to say. But the booze flows like Niagara and they all loosen up -- not that Martha requires much loosening.Albee's dialog is cynical, bitter, and exploitative. Cutting insults keep the viewer awake as do the sometimes embarrassing revelations, like Sandy Dennis's hysterical pregnancies and frequent vomiting. When Albee latches on to what he feels is a good turn of phrase, it gets repeated until it becomes laughable per se. "It's good that you're a biologist," Taylor tells Segal, "because you're right in the MEAT of things." She comes up with this again and again until Burton cuts her off with the observation that she's obsessed with the phrase and that it's vulgar.The comparison of Taylor's father, who is president of the college, to a big white mouse is repeated as well. And Taylor refers to her husband as, variously, a swamp, a bog, and a fen.Insults fly in all directions. One person may reveal a secret to another, who then runs over and trumpets the information to the others. They play what Burton calls "games", such as Humiliate the Host and Hump the Hostess. People make things up as they go along or present fantasies as historical fact. At one point, Segal knocks Burton to the floor. The exception to most of this verbal and physical violence is Sandy Dennis, who is too dumb to know what's going on much of the time.The party lasts all night and peters out at dawn, with Segal and Dennis leaving the house in a state of shock, and Burton and Taylor exhausted by their strenuous conflict.It's directed in a straightforward manner by Mike Nichols who doesn't pull any stylistic tricks. No flashbacks, no slow motion, no wobbling camera. That kind of razzle dazzle isn't really needed. How can you possibly pep up a volcano? I rather enjoy it. I get a kick out of its malice. Albee is gay and perhaps it takes a gay man or a straight woman to coax ignominy into such polished form. Maybe not. I don't know. I just know I like it when Burton accuses Taylor of "braying" and there follows a sharp argument over whether she "brays" or not, with Taylor sounding exactly like a mule.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two boring hours of obnoxious sarcasm.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Elizabeth Taylor's acting performance is excellent (with the exception of a few instances of overacting), I didn't enjoy this film. I thoroughly disliked the characters and the screenplay. It's a difficult task sitting through a movie this depressing and boring. I had to watch it in two sittings.The two main characters are uninteresting, crude, gloomy people whose dismal lives are engineered by their own dismal personalities. It held a morbid interest to me for about the first 20-25 minutes but then got very old very quickly. Regarding story, as far as I'm concerned there was none. The entire movie takes place during a single unbearable evening in which a new young teacher and his wife visit an unhappy, unsuccessful, drunken, obnoxious middle-aged couple of a college history department. As liquor flows the elder couple proceeds to tell the young couple the boring story of their miserable discontented personal lives, including dirty laundry, in a lengthy vulgar drunken loud argument. No plot, no moral, no endearing qualities. One descriptive adverb for this film is "over"; over-dramatic, over-acted, and mostly over-irritating; another word that comes to mind is "dumb", and another is "vulgar". The dialog of this movie is just a stream of vulgar sarcasm spewed by gloomy characters. Not my cup of tea. It gets a rating of 4 from me only because of the acting (the other three actors performances were also quite good) and the good film production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking on a Black &amp; White Budget!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truth or illusion, for George and Martha this was the prevailing conundrum which necessitates fatal compulsions!! George and Martha are the characters in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" played by Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. The two of them have been married several times in real life, their roles being such whereby they were victims of their own selfishness, and they were always seeking vindication for their own actions!! "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" epitomized their careers as paramount entertainers!!! Does this sound strong? Take several factors into account!! Liz Taylor has stated that this was her favorite role ever!! and Richard Burton was a theater buff who's tenacity with cranked out Hollywood entertainment was personally excruciating!! For Burton to even waste his time on a movie showed that it had enormous potential!! Critical acclaim for "Who's Afraid of Virgina Woolf" comes from the top, and adjectives such as riveting and unprecedented encompass this Edward Albee masterpiece!! The theater is the terrain of the esoteric, and is viewed by the prominent people in the entertainment business as the playground for prolific thought!! So many actors and actresses have a coveted professional integrity, and the erroneous perception by many that they are just America's stilted aristocracy who parade around in their chauffeured Bentley's down Fifth Ave and Wilshire Blvd devoting themselves vicariously through their agents to billing rights and residuals suggests a mono dimensional ism!! These actors and actresses often times seek higher ground!! Bringing Broadway and London to the silver screen sets higher standards for the movie industry!! Movies motivated by a theater engulfment represent a sensitizing zenith to the cinema.."Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" is indeed such a film!!This film has four major characters....George and Martha (Played by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor) and also Nick and Honey (played by George Segal and Sandra Dennis). Nick is a young professor with a lot of hang-ups, and Honey is the daughter of a wealthy minister who is perpetually introverted!! These four re pro bates commence at George and Martha's house for a night of dipsomaniacal pursuits and debauchery!! Now propagates a myriad of psychotic encumbrances!!! The joke of the night being "Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf, Virginia Woolf, Virginia Woolf, who's afraid of Virginia Woolf, so early in the morning?" This was the twisted doggerel that managed to perplex everyone!! George gives a callous pontification to everyone's diatribes and stupors of lamentation!! He uses these vulnerabilities as prey for his psychological defense strategy...It appears as though everyone is playing a game of academic genocide...It is quite evident this little gathering has created an aggregate vitiation of rational thought, and that this entire evening which consists of abhorrent inebriation, thus evoked a horrifying state of vulgarity!!The acting in this movie simply astounds you!! Elizabeth Taylor won an Oscar for best actress (as boisterous Martha, she gained weight for this role!!) George Segal won for best supporting actor (youth and talent, very unbeatable!!) Sandra Dennis won for best supporting actress (late 1960's early 1970's queen of serious roles!!) Richard Burton however, did not win for best actor, yet I felt his performance in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" was better than anybody else's!! Richard Burton brilliantly culminates intelligence with incredible dramatic acting ability!! Director, Mike Nichols,(The Graduate and so many other great movies), makes it look easy to expedite the depraved intricacies of negative human nature!! Last but not least, Edward Albee is utterly spellbinding with this script, as he compounds pejorative emotional inundation with cerebral torment. The end result as always the case with Edward Albee, is that he is without a doubt one of the greatest modern writers in American theater and film!! "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" exudes the genre of compelling misgivings about truth and illusion!! The camera angles depicting the emotional ugliness of the characters in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" puts this film in a category all by itself!! Hostile bantering of this detailed nature is so well illustrated that it easily supersedes the technological gimmickry and creative violence of mainstream Hollywood!!!The Title "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" correlates to the anguish and instability the famous author Virginia Woolf was plagued with!!!The overall turbulence which afflicts all of the major characters in this movie is unbelievably creative!! These disgruntled spawns of academia are perennially thwarted!!! The black and white depiction of these people intensifies the desperation these people are burdened with, and makes intransigence with reality dreadfully contagious!! This film is remarkable in it's originality by way of requiring conversation to have a combat initiative!!! In the final analysis, the question and riddle of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? ultimately gets relegated to the despondent retort by Martha "I am George, I am"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect? No, but as close as any movie's gotten so far...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a word, riveting. The ultimate emotional roller-coaster movie experience.There are a few movies that, should they come on television just as you're preparing to go to bed, you'll forego a good night's sleep to watch. This is one of them. It's the pinnacle of a 'car wreck' movie, gluing you to the screen in the same way people stare at bad car wrecks.Some have questioned why Honey and Nick didn't simply leave as they continued to be abused by their 'hosts' and the answer is quite simply the same as the audience: they can't turn away. Until the very end, they are the most sympathetic characters because much of the audience identifies with them as if they were in the same situation. That's the real purpose of Honey and Nick in this movie and the other thing that keeps people watching through what amounts to mutual psychological abuse. Just like a great, live sporting or a horrific news event, you have to stick around just to see what's going to happen next. This is also the source of the title. Virginia Woolf was known for her 'stream of consciousness' style of writing and is brought home by Taylor in one of the most poignantly touching final lines ever uttered in a movie.The most powerfully dramatic moments are when Burton smashes a liquor bottle on a fireplace mantle (to which Taylor torments, "I hope that was an empty bottle, George. You can't afford to waste good liquor on an associate professor's salary"), his great monologue with Nick about his childhood, the exchange between Burton and Taylor when she says with such restrained fury, "What did you just say to me?", to which Burton responds with a deliberate, "I...ate...it..." and she spits in his face, and, of course, the soft, yet powerful, ending which explains everything.The only flaws (and they are minor) are essentially the same as with most great plays that are transferred to film, i.e., when the movie's setting leaves the 'stage'. Here, it's when the cast moves from the living room to the bar/dance floor and then also drags a bit when Taylor returns to the house. Even here, there is some brilliant cinematography in the bar parking lot. Check out the lighting behind Taylor as she berates Burton. This alone makes the setting change worth it. It was also a little unbelievable that Martha and Nick would then be later having sex upstairs while Honey and George waited for them downstairs. But I suppose it was necessary as a plot contrivance to force George into his final 'game'.But that's it. Everything else is so superbly done that these things are mere quibbles and crop up only after many viewings. Compared with other greats such as Citizen Kane, Casablanca and The Godfather, this one has the absolute lowest 'error' factor (and we're talking about some real subtle nuance flaws here) and the highest rating as far as emotional audience effect.It is simply a 'must-see' for anyone serious about movies concerning in-depth, intricate character interaction on a level which involves the viewer in an intimate way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** This movie may contain spoilage *** I saw this when it came out and didn't care for it at all. The big deal at the time was Liz Taylor made up to look old and frumpy. I think she then did a later film called 'Ash Wednesday' to reverse the procedure.Anyway, Liz and Dick were married in real life and it was reported that they had similar encounters with Jack Daniels and boisterous 'conversations' at home, so this should have been a walk-in-the-park acting job for both of them.But, it was awful. The story was repulsive as were all the characters. I feel that trying to analyze drunken behavior in a movie is a pointless endeavor that, for some reason, actors and directors think is a life affirming philosophic inquiry......or something. I would compare this to trying to pass a driving test while drunk. It doesn't work.Burton does his usual Shakespearean speechifying. Taylor is a caricature of whatever she is supposed to be. Bette Davis's Baby Jane Hudson was more real and realistic than Martha. At times, the lighting and camera work inside the house reminded me of very early 1950s TV soap operas.All in all, a lousy evening for the 4 of them and me.</fullReview>

This was the first film that was focus on a relationship. There not really a point to the film except watching this dysfunctional couple going at it all night. The major downfall to this film is that some of the conversation drags out, and I would begin to feel myself wondering off. The acting is good. The camera is always focused on the actors there not much going on in the back ground. The film is shot in low-key lighting which makes sense since it's a dark film in a way. The camera performs a lot of long shots. A film I would not watch again. Like I said I like some of the techniques but because of the way it drags out it didn't really keep my attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Isn't marriage grand? Consider Ward and June Cleaver, middle-aged love birds, together with their two wonderfully wholesome boys, Wally and The Beaver, all bubbling over with affection toward each other, and nary a care in the world. But in a bold, head-on attack directed at fake, 1950s family idealism, "Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?" shatters myths, gleefully stomps on our 1960s rose-colored glasses, and refocuses our vision on a legal institution that too often resembles a pit of fire and brimstone.Husband George and wife Martha, harshly antagonistic to each other, hurl insults, dish out verbal abuse, spew hatred to a degree almost certainly never expressed in films prior to 1966. Their venom even extends to a married couple that drops by George and Martha's house for a friendly visit. Soon, all four adults are in the throes of a verbal Armageddon.The main characters here are terribly damaged people, irrevocably injured, emotionally crippled for the rest of their lives. At one point Martha screams out: "I'm loud and I'm vulgar, and I wear the pants in the house because somebody's got to". George fires back: "You're a spoiled, self-indulgent, willful, dirty-minded, liquor-ridden ...". A couple of minutes later after more back and forth insults, Martha asks: "Is that a threat, George?" He responds: "That's a threat Martha." She screams angrily: "You're going to get it baby". To which George retaliates: "Be careful, Martha, I'll rip you to pieces". Martha explodes: "You're not man enough; you haven't the guts". Nice couple. One wonders why they were attracted to each other in the first place.Although the film's B&amp;W lighting, the sets, and other elements are fine, it's the script and the acting that propel this production. I must say, I did not like Martha or George. I didn't like any of the four main characters. They're all unsympathetic, boring, pathetic, and loquacious. The story is such a talk-fest, the script must have weighed forty pounds. The back and forth arguing is relentless. It never stops. A little bit of these dreadful people goes a long way.On the other hand, I appreciate the film's willingness to buck traditional cinematic views of marriage and family. And the acting really is quite good. I think Taylor probably dominates the film. But Burton is good too in his own way."Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?" is a 1960s avant-garde film with a story that is dramatically dense. If one can tolerate the script's characters, the film does provide some fine acting. I'm glad I watched it. But I don't think I want to see it again anytime soon. It's just too draining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The games people play. Throughout this entire film (based on an intense play by Edward Albee), we are never sure what the truth is. George and Martha have a marriage made in hell. They have an intense hatred of one another fueled by years of disappointment. Then again, perhaps this is how they express their love. Enter Sandy Dennis and George Segal who believe they are attending a quiet evening with an again professor and his wife. They are soon drawn into the clutches of these two. Elizabeth Taylor, with weight packed on to do the role, and Richard Burton, two cinema icons, strut their stuff, leading the poor souls who have wandered into the web with tales and sparks and deception. Dennis is a mousy little thing who tries to cope, but we can see her eroding each minute she is in this hornet's nest. This is one of America's great stage plays and the movie really does it justice. Was Taylor a great actress. You bet she was. And Burton. Oh yeah!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to recommend a movie like "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" It is by no means an easy view. Set in minimal locations, mostly in a living room, the film is a constant emotionally harassing roller coaster. Aging couple George and Martha entertain a young couple after a night of drinking, but it soon turns into a game of searing at everyone's deepest, bitterest secrets. George and Martha are, quite frankly, vicious in their bashing of each other, and neither emerges at any time as true villain or hero. You come to understand, slowly, that something must have happened to this couple. Slowly, through the course of the film, you may find out what.Elizabeth Taylor is beyond praise in her performance of the frightening Martha, an emotionally tortured woman who seems to be fighting a hidden pain. Richard Burton is perfect as her folly, George, whose verbal tactics are more controlled but every bit as biting. Both these characters have secrets that they wish to hide, and that we try to piece together the pieces of. This is a great movie, but expect to be satisfied with one view, because it will really take it out of you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sad, Shocking, Witty Night of Fun and Games</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They sure don't make 'em like this anymore. Released in 1966, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" is a film adaptation of the Edward Albee play, which debuted four years earlier, about a sadistic, wickedly humorous married couple, George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), who draw a younger husband and wife (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) into their twisted dynamic throughout a very late night. Once considered so shocking because of its language and themes, which was relatively profane and outrageous for the time, it's now jarring to see a film explore the dynamics of human relationships with such well-observed intelligence, wit, candor, and complexity. It's sheer perfection and one of my all-time favorite films.Directed by then first-timer Mike Nichols, and adapted by Ernest Lehman, it stays wonderfully faithful to the play, even though some minor things are cut and added for the film medium and length. Albee sees people with an x-ray vision and gives George and Marta this ruthless sense of honesty. Not only do they strip the people around them bare, but they can turn the same fierce insight back on themselves. It has a devastating effect, like a car crash you have to watch, but it can also turn a dime and be absolutely funny.It's a highly dialogue-driven affair, with lots of long takes. You've got to be able to pay attention to get into this movie. And unlike some contemporary and rather self-indulgent dialogue-heavy writers like Tarantino or Sorkin, the dialogue never seems arch or self-conscious or unnecessary. Every conversation is very natural and has a deeper meaning, especially when you dive further into the film and discover just how self-constructed George and Martha's lives are. Their lies, fantasies, and fictions are ironic considering how brutally truthful they are in other moments. But, it goes to show just how honest and how dishonest people can be, at the same time. Even the most straightforward people lie to themselves and to others, at times, to be protected from the harsh reality of frustrations, doubts, failures, or unhappiness. And when this all emerges during the climax, it's totally heartbreaking.The writing is genius but the performances are really what seal the deal. In my opinion, there's not a link weak in the bunch. Everyone adds something different and distinctive to the film.Elizabeth Taylor rightfully won an Oscar for Best Actress for her hurricane of a performance as Martha. It might seem a bit overplayed, at moments, but that element completely works when you consider how overplayed Martha is, as a person. She is intentionally loud, obnoxious, rude, and vulgar. But, Taylor adds such soul, heartbreak and humanity to her that you can't help but feel for her and even see some of yourself or someone you know in her mean-spirited streak.Her then husband Richard Burton has, in some ways, the less showy role. George holds back quite a bit in the first act, seeming simply like Martha's sharp-witted yet castrated husband. But, when he lets loose, watch out. The passivity drops and he is totally ferocious. You see the anger that's been brewing inside of him for years with Martha, as well as the disappointment and emptiness. He should've won the Oscar.George Segal has the most thankless role of the quartet, having to basically be the "sane" one throughout the film. But, he also acts as our moral compass. You can relate to Nick's horror and discomfort at everything that's happening, as well as the way he's eventually roped into all of the games and how that's even more horrifying to him.Sandy Dennis gives an Oscar-winning performance full of unusual yet spot-on choices. She plays dumb very well, especially since Honey is playing dumb herself. She's just so awkward and out-of-place in the midst of everything that she has to act stupid and oblivious, as well as getting hysterically drunk, just to survive.This is a true acting masterclass and one of the most moving, layered, and truthful films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is the most honest film depicting a troubled marriage I have ever seen. Having said this, one should not view it while depressed. This film goes so deep into the human psyche and should be viewed with that understanding. Elizabeth Taylor plays her best role as Martha, the drunken wife. Richard Burton as the husband, George, is both scary and worn down by his pairing with Martha. Enter Sandy Dennis and George Segal as pawns in a chess game and there is the human drama in all its glorious pain. The turmoil and pain is within them. When they lash out at one another and their visitors, the viewer sees flashes and pieces of their very souls. A brilliant film for the camera work, the setting and of course the top notch acting for all four characters. Never be afraid of Virginia Woolf as she lives in all of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely relentless with its content, overflowing with charged emotions &amp; sustaining its intensity from start to finish, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a tour-de-force of sublime direction, ingenious writing &amp; explosive performances that takes hold of your attention with its armour-piercing dialogues &amp; never lets go until the very end.The story concerns George &amp; Martha; a middle-aged married couple, whose relationship over the years has turned very bitter &amp; volatile. The plot covers one late evening in their lives when Martha invites a young couple for drinks but this new couple only find themselves caught in the verbal battle between Martha &amp; George which escalates under the influence of alcohol as the night progresses.Directed by Mike Nichols, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is his directional debut &amp; he really couldn't have asked for a better start. The screenplay by Ernest Lehman is arguably its finest aspect &amp; its foul-mouthed script stays very true to the play it is adapted from. Cinematography makes terrific use of its black-n-white photography &amp; uses its long takes or fluid movements quite effectively while editing never lets the drama lose its potency.Coming to the performances, the cast consists of Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, George Segal &amp; Sandy Dennis and each one of them has delivered a performance that's as excellent as it is maddening. Still, the best amongst the four in my opinion was Taylor who was constantly challenged by Burton &amp; the fierceness with which these two hurled insults at each other makes up for the film's most memorable moments.On an overall scale, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? begins as an unstable black comedy which felt like it will explode any moment but over the course of its runtime turns into an engrossing tragedy that ends on a devastating note. Also, make sure you sit through the exit music because once you're done with what's nothing less than an emotionally shattering ride, you're going to need it in order to return to normalcy. Thoroughly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took me several, several, several, several viewings, each one riddled with meaningful but useless interpretations, judgments on unabashedness, and heart-wrenching climaxes and payoffs. And what I found was once you drive beneath the alcohol, smoking, elaborately scalding insults, frustrations with intimacy, not to mention the said years of accumulative build-up of hate, resentment, dissatisfaction and rage, what you'll find is a very straight story. Take for instance the scene where George and Martha are just leaving a particular establishment. Martha is angry at George, George plays on it after defending his dignity, Martha scolds George, George vents at Martha for not seeing what she did to him, Martha threatens George, George promises to take revenge, George and Martha go into an entire monologue with their marriage at its core, though they both choose to stay, there's a whole set-up where they promise not to hold back tearing each other to pieces, Martha drives off with the car and George is forced to walk back.Now the screenwriter could've taken away the demons, leaving a much lighter and "prettier" story, but Lehman's choice represents not only his strength with the combined perseverance of Nichols, Taylor and Burton against Warner Bros.' protests, but also their faith in the story. Despite its controversy, there was no denying its greatness. Anyone brave enough to join the fun and games will not leave the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you had any remaining doubts about the direction that cinema was taking in the '60s, you need only watch Mike Nichols's first two movies. "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and "The Graduate" both belie the image of the wholesome family. The former, however, is actually a little more extreme. Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor make your blood freeze as couple George and Martha, who use their guests (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) as conduits to vent their hostility towards each other. Seriously, this is one REALLY intense movie.I wouldn't go so far as to call it a masterpiece. There's something a little jarring about people who spend all day drinking and verbally attacking each other. Even so, you really have to admire the acting and the content (which was basically R-rated in that era). Therefore, I recommend the movie, just as long as you understand that this is NOT a film for the fainthearted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Detestable characters don't always make for a detestable movie, but here they do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The challenge in making a movie about detestable people is to prevent the movie from becoming detestable by extension. Being detestable is quite a bit easier than being likable, so it is no great feat to write characters like George (Richard Burton), Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), and the feckless young couple they make privy to their spats. But to make such characters compelling and sympathetic as well?a necessity if the audience is to care about the juvenile antics happening on screen?is much more challenging. The cost of failure is the sense that the melodrama is merely contrived and devoid of relatable meaning. Ernest Lehman's adapted screenplay and Mike Nichols' directing fail to find an avenue inside George and Martha's histrionic act to make it feel like something more than merely contrived. Burton and Taylor's expert scenery chewing (the movie would tolerate nothing more artful from its actors) compensates to a degree, and in an early scene Taylor gets the chance to impersonate Bette Davis, which she does remarkably well. Still, viewers seeking a more intelligent and moving film on the theme of domestic dysfunction would do better to watch Liz in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" (1958).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My all time favorite movie.Why? I find myself asking that all the time. And the more I think about how vulgar it is, the more I recognize it's brilliance.So why is it my favorite movie? Is it because of an entertaining story that compels you from the minute? No, because the movie itself is not supposed to be entertaining. Is it that the movie has a deep profound moral that leaves you thinking? Well, it does have a deep profound moral, but that isn't really the reason.The reason is because of character. Because the movie made you care about people that you would never really care about. The movie, in short, is about a vulgar elderly couple who return home drunk from a party and bring the guests that they invited over for a nightcap down to their level. The elderly couple, George and Martha, brilliantly portrayed by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, have an extreme love/hate relationship. Their constant bickering and yelling and loving make them the perfect opposite for Nick and Honey, portrayed by George Segal and Sandy Dennis, who seem to be the ideal American couple. But as the night progresses, and more alcohol is consumed, things seem to change, and not for the better...Throughout the movie, your either of George's side, or your on Martha's side. I was on George's side in the beginning, but at the end, I found myself on Martha's side. All the characters change, in one way or another, and your perception on them change as they do. Now, as I said, the movie is all about character. Because even though you think you know these characters, you never really do. All the twists and turns in their personalities lead you down a different path. That explains my summary heading. And it's true. A collective character analysis would probably be the size of a Harry Potter novel.By the end of the movie, you don't know what's real, what's a lie, and who is going to be the first to crack under the pressure of the other three. All of these things lead to a stunning end, where all is revealed. This is one the of few perfect movies. The best combination of acting, directing, writing, and moral that I've ever seen. An emotionally draining movie that will make you happy your not George or Martha. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This realistic drama explores love-hate relationship and cruelty in a marriage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966)Back in 1966, when I was a teenager, I heard that Hollywood had produced a good movie, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?", which became an instant success because the film was considered to be a major breakthrough in the world of movie-making. I did not know anything about the film, except the actors Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, who respectively played the role of Martha and George. I thought the movie was about the biography of the well-known British novelist and critic Virginia Woolf.I was wrong, as the film has nothing to do with the life of Ms Woolf. Last week I saw the DVD's special edition of the film. After watching it, I could not help but admire the film because the film, more than just "very good", turns out to be a cinematic tour de force."Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" is based on Edward Albee's play of the same name. This realistic drama, aside from exploring the power struggles in society, also examines the love-hate relationship and cruelty in a marriage. All this is reflected in the married life of the childless, middle aged couple George and Martha. George is a history professor who has not made any achievement in many years as a lecturer in a New England college. His weakness and lack of ambition has made him the easy target of his wife's mockery. Martha, a heavy drinker, dominates her husband in almost every way. One night, after attending a college party, they invited a younger couple Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis) to have a drink at their home. It is during this nightcap that the family drama begins to develop in full force. Angst, anguish, deceit,and infidelity follows one another as the night goes deeper and all this ends at daybreak as the weary older couple go to bed and the younger one walk to their home. Presenting such difficult psychological problems to wider audiences than those in the playhouse who usually comprise drama lovers, director Mike Nichols obviously needs the full backup of his team. The result indicates that Nichols did get what he needed and hence movie audiences can enjoy the superb acting of Miss Taylor and Mr. Burton. Good close-up takes showing Martha's hysterical grief after George has told her that their son, who in fact never exists, was killed in an accident attest to the cinematographer's outstanding achievement. And those sad gestures and facial expressions can only be performed by actresses of high caliber such as Miss Taylor. And again, the camera works well when it focuses on George's facial expressions, which clearly depict his agony and helplessness as he watches the shadows of his wife and Nick kissing in her bedroom. The repeated utterance of the then tabooed four-letter word, which is square by present standard, obviously shows how director Nichols has slogged his guts out for making a realistic movie. This, perhaps, is what that has made the public consider "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" a major breakthrough in movie-making..The film won five Academy Awards which went to Elizabeth Taylor for Best Actress; Sandy Dennis for Best Supporting Actress; while the other three for Black-and-White Art Direction, Costumes, and Cinematography. ?

		<fullReview>Yes. I do realize that this film has indeed lost a considerable amount of its venom, clout and vicious bite since its initial release back in 1966, but, all the same, I certainly don't think that it was really all that good, anyways.For me, a film whose sole focus is to zero in on some seriously demented marital dysfunction certainly gets to be a mighty big bore, real fast. If you don't take this film's stinking bull at face value, then having to endure watching the blowzy, lard-assed Elizabeth Taylor verbally duking it out with the loud, obnoxious Richard Burton can quickly become quite humorous, almost cartoonish in nature.I mean, can you just imagine (for over 2 frickin' hours) having to tolerate that porkette Taylor and that pricko Burton (a couple of real grotesque clowns, indeed) tearing away at each other's throats and chewing up the scenery (especially Taylor), non-stop? Back in its day, this film was considered groundbreaking (and, I guess, that it was) for its high level of profanity and sexual implications. This was the first film to use the word "bugger", and the phrase "screw you" in its dialogue. And it was also the first to be given the MPAA tag - "No one under 18 will be admitted unless accompanied by his parent." Personally, I've always hated this film's title, which really has nothing, in the least bit, to do with the story. And, believe me, no one will ever, ever convince me that that bloated bag, Elizabeth Taylor, was at all deserving of the Oscar she won for her portrayal of Martha.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I'm shocked by this film, having just passed through the seen-it-all decade of the 90s, imagine what this must have been like 30-odd years ago, when the 60s were just getting into the "social unrest" period and censorship codes were only just being broken. (If I'm not mistaken, this was one of the movies that really knocked them down.) With unsparring direction from Mike Nichols, in his directing debut, good camera work, and a very intense performance from Elizabeth Taylor, who is essentially playing herself if you believe everything you hear, this is an extremely scathing, blistering film that pulls no punches and really leaves a mark. Part black comedy, part drama, part cat-fight fest, all good. Richard Burton is especially good, being capable of wry one-liners and moving monologues. He probably should have won the Oscar. Definitly should be seen... if you have the guts, that is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taylor and Burton give extraordinary performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As this black and white film opens and the credits are rolling, we see a couple leaving a party and walking slowly back to their house. They're arm-in-arm and seemingly all is quiet and right with the world. The second the action starts, when Liz Taylor flicks on the light and we begin hearing her talk with Richard Burton, we know all is definitely not right. And thus begins 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'.The two play a college history professor and his wife, who is also the dean's daughter, and we quickly come to know that they are (a) very unhappy and frustrated with one another, (b) highly blunt and sarcastic in expressing this, and (c) functioning alcoholics. The first scene which lasts something like 50 minutes and has a younger professor and his wife (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) coming over to drinks is absolutely stunning. The script and Taylor and Burton's performances are outstanding. Humiliation, flirting with the opposite sex, telling stories and confusing "truth and illusion" to play mind games with the other are the order of the day, and the two serve it up again and again in ways which may make your jaw drop. The movie is minimalistic in the sense that it only has these four major characters, two extremely minor characters (who briefly appear when they visit a roadside bar), and it all takes place in a single night, mostly in their home. However, the performances are explosive and 'larger than life'. Taylor in particular really put herself out there, because let's face it, putting on weight and acting like a loud, cheap, bully is far more dangerous for a woman than it is for a man. Images of the SNL sketch from a decade later may come to your mind as she munches on a chicken leg and then carelessly tosses the bone back on the plate in the fridge. She is absolutely exceptional, and was worthy of the Academy Award she received. I was also reminded of the power in some of Jennifer Lawrence's recent performances as I watched her, but Taylor takes it to another level. Burton is also fantastic, trying to remain intellectual and appear above it all, but displaying a frustrated rage within and constantly needling all the three of the other characters. When he goes out for the rifle in the garage as Taylor is telling an embarrassing story about him and returns with it, we feel serious tension, and I thought first-time director Mike Nichols did a great job here and throughout the movie.It loses a teeny bit of momentum towards the middle, and I have to say, the story behind their child, whose apparent death seems to be an explanation for why they've gone a bit kooky, but who has been an imaginary child all along, does not ring true, at least in the emotions it evokes out of each of them. While it's a symbol of an unrealized dream they share, just as Burton's failure to advance in the hierarchy at the college is, to me this is a weakness in the original play. The ending, which as them tenderly resigned to one another despite all that bickering and fighting (and bottle breaking, and choking!), is powerful nonetheless. It's not exactly a feel-good movie, but it's one that will stir you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?"(1966) directed by Mike Nichols and starring the phenomenal and iconic film star Elizabeth Taylor is as dramatic as they come in the magical world of Hollywood. this film breaks open quite a few of the social norms. Actually in breaks quite o few film norms. the behavior of our protagonists Martha and George is something very shocking to be displayed in a 1960s film. the breaking of certain barriers was certainly beginning to trend. the film was shot in a sequence which was unconventional as well a kind of dark imagery is used to emphasis the break down of an emotionally worn down marriage. filmed in black and white brilliantly and marking one of the last great ones by the way, dim lighting and somber yet exciting tracks make for almost a satire experience. Martha and George seen hurting each other yet enjoying themselves simultaneously is sinister yet fun. not to mention the "lil buggah" son we never get to see in the film which was a powerful decision for a picture like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always hard when you approach a movie as celebrated as this one was - nominated for every Academy award in 1966 - and run the risk of saying "I don't get it".It's not an easy movie to sit through. Dark and harrowing and only semi-humorous. The premise also seems a little dated now. Two couples, young and middle aged, both have relationships precipitated on lies: the younger woman pretended to be pregnant so that the man would marry her, the older couple pretending to have a child, but only with each other.How long has this pretense existed between them? It appears to be years, and the only thing that binds them together. But Elizabeth Taylor's character shares this information with the younger woman, breaking a cardinal law she shares with her husband. Why?The performances, dialogue and direction remain very impressive. But the story doesn't have the same sledgehammer blow I imagine it would have had years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a forcible masterpiece pitilessly scrutinises the most surreptitious human stains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late Mike Nichols' acclaimed director debut, a four-character powerhouse play from Edward Albee and is adapted by Ernest Lehman. Starring Taylor and Burton in their most virulent aggressions, as Martha and George, a middle-aged couple, George is an associate history professor in a New England college and Martha is the daughter of the college president.It all happens in one night, after returning home from a party hosted by Martha's father, under the influence, they starts quibbling about a movie starring Betty Davis, but neither of them can remember the title (actually it is BEYOND THE FOREST 1949), it is vexatious but could happen to any couple who have been married for a sizable time, squabbles aside, Martha gets offensive when George refuses to kiss her. Although it is past midnight, they are still expecting company, Martha invited a young couple who they have just met in the party to come by. Apparently, they don't need anyone else to get under each other's skin, but when there is an audience, it will be more intense.So it begins, arrive Nick and Honey (Segal and Dennis), a handsome biology professor and his meek wife who are just newly in town. The tension is immediately kindled between the men through George's breezy teasing, and a clear shot of George noticing Martha's over-friendly caress of Nick's hand sets the strain in a highly tangible mode which implies a possibility of fornication. Martha strikes first, rails at George for his ineffectuality in his career, who is "preoccupied with history" and bogged down as an associative professor, while George is busy offering liqueur to both guests and hosts, retorts incessantly in the verbal abuse game.It is rather embarrassing for Nick and Honey, to watch a couple they barely know throwing harsh accusations towards each other, but their facade of politeness soon dissolves, after Honey mentions that Martha tells her, they have a son and the next day happens to be his sixteenth birthday, and George suddenly turns infuriated. Abetted by the steady intake of alcohol, the game of "humiliating the host" runs amok (a broken bottle and an unexpected gun scare), Honey is the first who cannot hold her liquor. During her vomit break, the onlooker becomes a participant, Nick removes the guard and divulges his own true feelings of marrying Honey after George tells him a disturbing story of a boy accidentally kills his both parents (in two separate cases), it will boomerang at the game of "get the guests" in a roadhouse and escalates the drama into "hump the hostess".Eventually, the exhausting cocktail of frustration, complaint, discontent, jealousy, self-contempt and self-destruction has been subsumed to the division between reality and pure illusion, it is something Nick finally realises, and it is the theme has been foreshadowed all along the film, ever since Martha breaks the rules of the game, George has been hell-bent to use the ace in the hole to win the final round, however, the end result is ever so futile, after a long and dragging night, truth is brought to the open, but after a sound sleep and the catalyst of alcohol, little will change for George and Martha and as for Nick and Honey, their ill-matched, lies-riddled young matrimony is destined for a sad ending, what a pessimistic take on modern marriage, yet the impetus is so thrilling and palpable.The quartet performers, the harridan, the doormat, the climber and the flaky, are marvellous to behold. Taylor inconceivably transmogrifies herself into an unglamorous shrew (she was only 33 then) with the campiest and most relentless verbal strafing, she is the devil of language, while Burton takes the soapbox to unreservedly exhibit George's more sophisticated inner feelings and bellows out his lines with soul-stirring cadence. Segal and Dennis, mirror a different specimen of incompatible personalities, are both at the top of their games. The film is nominated for 13 Oscars (with 5 wins, including for Taylor and Dennis) and is one of only two films to be nominated in every eligible category (the other one is CIMARRON 1931), a record cannot be exceeded by latecomers, it is rather absurd to image in today's weather, any theatre-based piece of work with the similar scale (Roman Polanski's CARNAGE 2011, is the latest cousin in my mind) can harvest all the top honours (especially outside the the acting branches) wholesale and that's the legacy behind this forcible masterpiece pitilessly scrutinising the most surreptitious human stains.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who is afraid of her...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" is a drama movie in which we watch a middle age couple who use a young couple to bring nothing more than pain towards each other. In this crazy situation we figure out what is going on to their lives but also many other things that they wanted to keep them as secrets and never reveal them. Unfortunately they can not handle themselves because of alcohol and nothing can stop them from disaster.I really liked this movie because of the plot which was simple with no swifts but extremely interesting. The direction which made by Mike Nichols was simply one of his best. In addition to this I have to mention the beautiful interpretation of Elizabeth Taylor who played as Martha (won the Oscar for the Best Actress in a Leading Role) and also the interpretation of Richard Burton who played as George and in my opinion he was very good at it. One more interpretation that has to be mentioned is Sandy Dennis who played as Honey and she was equally good as the others (won the Oscar for the Best Actress in a Supporting Role).Finally I believe that "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" is a must see movie for every movie fan. It shows us the pain of people who are not speaking with each other and also it shows us that with loneliness come many other things including plenty of problems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Late Night Brawl A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a brilliant movie with acting, script, and characters that will entertain and enrage you. The repartee is very clever and one can sense the madness that grips people when they descend into drunken debauchery. It is brutally honest and shows how a marriage can suffer severe damage over time because of resentments, jealousness, and lost dreams. There are glimpses of affection but these are short-lived and seem to magnify the bottomless pit that one couple named George and Martha have fallen into. The repartee and the acting draw us into one scene after another where Martha, played by Elizabeth Taylor, and George, Richard Burton, tear each other apart with their words. The movie involves a late night party with a younger couple who, almost against their will, get dragged into the humiliation that George and Martha inflict on each other. Not content with directing their insults at one another, George and Martha find weak spots in the two guests, who leave feeling as if their souls have been laid bare as well. The other couple are Sandy Dennis as Honey, and George Segal as Nick, a youthful biology teacher. Both are outstanding as well. The four people play out their drama on a small college campus where Martha's father is a hidden character who runs the campus. One can imagine that this would be a complicating factor for most couples and George and Martha have made the worst of it. The other character is a son, who is a bit of a riddle, since he never appears either. A roadhouse manager and server also appear. I found it mildly amusing to see the elderly server walk through a door and place the drinks on the table as the others sit in stunned silence wondering what she must be thinking of the warring couples who have stopped by for yet another drink during their evening binge. There are a number of very effective close-up shots that bring you almost face to face with the characters. There is also a stunt in the midst of the ongoing brawl that will take you by surprise and leave you laughing with relief. This has to be one of the most important movies of the 1960's and possibly of all time. It seems very daring for the mid-sixties and neatly combines the best of cinema and stage. It has stood the test of time and by that standard is a classic.</fullReview>

George and Martha's constant verbal sparring dances around their mysterious sixteen year old son.There are four amazing performances in this movie. The headline act is the Burton Taylor show. They don't give an inch of ground in their performances. They bounce off each other like pros. Segal and Dennis are just as compelling. Sandy Dennis especially gives a performance that shines in opposition to the headliners. They give some great drunk acting.

		<shortDescription>Mike Nichols was not afraid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On December 6 2014, Turner Classic Movies (TCM) is doing a retrospective of the late Mike Nichols film career. Its first offering: Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?Mike Nichols was special. Some say gifted, but I've never liked that word as it applies to accomplishment; it implies, to me anyway, an elitist privilege that further implies a nonpayment of appropriate dues. Mike Nichols was born to a Jewish family in Berlin Germany in 1931. In 1939 his father, a doctor, had the means and the foresight to escape the oncoming holocaust just before it was to begin in earnest. There is a hell of a story in there somewhere, but I have never heard it. My point being that escaping from the Nazi's is enough dues paying for a lifetime.Yeah, he was special, but what astonishes me in reviewing his life work, is how he was apparently able to immediately impress everybody else that he was special. His first directorial assignment was not off ?Broadway, not off-off Broadway, not dinner theater in Poughkeepsie, but on Broadway for established writer Neil Simon. The result was" Barefoot in the Park" for which Nichols would win a Tony award as best director. The play would become Simon's longest running play ever (around or above four years) and the 10th longest running non musical production in Broadway history! First at bat: grand slam home run.Sometime in the 1960's legendary producer Jack Warner (yes that Warner of Warner Bros. Studios or Time-Warner if you prefer) thought the eccentric writings of playwright Edward Albee in his play"Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf" might make a good movie. I don't know how he came to that conclusion, but conclude it he did, and he hired multiple Academy Award nominee Ernest Lehman to write the screen play, and then cast Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton to play the leads.Just a few words about Liz and Dick; they were the Godmother and Godfather of celebrity pop culture. They weren't just big; they were the biggest?by far. They would dominate the tabloid press and intrude into the real news for almost twenty years. To compare them to modern celebrity like the Kardasians is not only ludicrous but blasphemous. OK, who should direct this spicy hot mélange? Why not someone who's never directed a movie before? Mike Nichols. Success on Broadway is not a guarantee of success in cinema. Bob Fosse's first foray was "Sweet Charity" which is a certifiable catastrophe. In stage craft everybody is always in full shot, in cinema you have to know when to push the camera in, when to pull it back, when to open the story up so it looks like a movie and not a photographed play. There is a certain grammar to cinema and it needs to be used correctly. It is essential in order to create and build the emotional tension that is so necessary for this film's success. In his first attempt, does Nichols succeed? Well, here's the stat line: 13 Academy Award nominations. It was only the second and last film to ever be nominated in all the categories for which it was eligible. It won five, including one for Ms Taylor, surprisingly not one for Mr. Burton, nor one for Mr. Nichols (although that would be remedied shortly.) And! It was a financial success being one of the top 10 grossing movies of 1966. Nichols first at bat for a different team: Grand slam home run.Pocket Review:If you didn't know who Virginia Woolf was before you see this movie, you will certainly be afraid of her by the end of it.George (Richard Burton) is a teacher at some unnamed small college and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) is the daughter of the college president. They are a middle aged married couple who are disappointed in how their lives have turned out, especially since their life together seemed to have started out with so much promise and advantage. Their coping mechanism is to blame each other for their failures both individually and as a couple, and this failure is complete, professional, emotional, and sexual. Oh, yeah, they also drink a lot, that's always helpful.In to this toxic alcoholic mix comes a young professor at the college Nick (George Segal) and his mousey wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) who Martha has invited over to their on campus house for "a drink". They will serve as audience surrogates as together we will watch as George and Martha's marriage explosively dissolves. As the drama demands, they will also become participants to the wreckage, but more than that, they get to walk through the looking glass and see what bleak future may be in store for them. It is through the interaction of this fabulous four, that we, the audience, discover that George and Martha have constructed a nest of lies in order to keep themselves at least one hash mark above the median of sanity, and it is through these lies that the deeper psychological truth is revealed.What does it mean? Why should we care? Honestly I don't know. I have always had trouble figuring this movie out, but I have watched it several times, always with avid fascination. I wouldn't call it one of the best movies ever, but I would certainly call it one of the most extraordinary. Mike Nichols film directorial debut. It was a doozy. Thanks Mike... I think. Nichols next offering goes beyond any baseball metaphor I could possibly come up with. It was certifiable, bone fide phenomenon. "The Graduate".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?" was certainly a daring film to make for Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Being that they both had already had a very public volatile relationship, you can imagine how hard it must've been to be to basically be facing the truth about each other in this story. And the strength of the film very much lies in it's frank look at marital problems and how NOT to solve them.It is an emotionally draining film as another reviewer said in the sense, that as this one night evolves, we hear some conversations that are so life like in their strangeness and off beat construction, that we might have preferred not to have heard, but it really does show us something about people and relationships(romantic or otherwise) that we might not have initially faced otherwise. Certainly a lot of that credit goes to playwright Edward Albee and screenwriter Ernest Lehman, who deserve all the money they've made off this movie.Everyone knows the story here, so I won't cover it too much, but for those few who don't, I'll just say it's unforgettable. Throughout the movie, Martha and George(Taylor, and Burton) split up to have discussions sometimes between each other, sometimes with the young couple who has visited(Honey and Nick, played by Sandy Dennis and George Segal respectively), in what leads to some the strongest manipulation between a married couple in a movie you'll ever see. It's strange, but the movie oddly enough also works effectively as a psychological thriller. The odds and ends of these characters unravel in an incredibly suspenseful and intriguing way that is unforgettable.But most of all, the acting is what makes this movie work. Richard Burton especially is hypnotic in his obsessive devotion to whatever pops into his mind, and he has a few speeches in here that he performs so well, it's a shame he didn't win an Oscar for it. However, Taylor is extremely good as well, humorous but not hilarious and entirely convincing. Admittedly, the young couple aren't as big a part of the movie, but nevertheless perform well and are still interesting characters.So if you haven't already seen it, check it out. It'll certainly leave you thinking much in the same way Mike Nichols' similarly good, but more uneven film "The Graduate". It's a film you shan't soon forget, and for all you actors out there, take notes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf for me was an interesting movie. At first I felt almost as though I was intruding on George and Martha in their fights. Their fighting had such chemistry that I felt I was watching a real married couple in a verbal sparing match. This movie is also very disturbing in a way. The way that George and Martha have a bizarre co-dependence on each other and their yelling matches keep their marriage together. The acting done by Uta Hagen in this film was incredible. She had such a passion in the movie that I felt that she was at times yelling at me. The spite in her voice when she is talking about her husbands' failures astounded me. All in all i felt this was a very intense movie if you give yourself a chance to get into it.</fullReview>

I really felt as if I had been there in the living room with them in the battle ground of both marriages. Psychological warfare going on. I was guessing the whole film as to whether their son was real. I was wondering who wrote the script. To me, I felt this was more art-house cinema than mainstream as the intense nature of the film with the threat of violence hanging over it, I felt might put a lot of people off watching.

		<fullReview>This is, no contest, the finest film that Burton and Taylor made together, as well it may be boasting as it does a strong script adapted reasonably faithfully from an outstanding play and featuring exceptional support from George Segal and Sandy Dennis. There are, strange as it may seem, parallels with Noel Coward's Private Lives, both were, to all intents and purposes, four-handers but where Coward wrote two Star parts and two foils Albee wrote two strong Leading parts and two equally strong supporting roles. Burton, a fine stage actor who prostituted his great talent in Hollywood dross was seldom better on screen - only his world-weary Alec Leeman in The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is in the same league - and he was definitely robbed of an Oscar. Alex North weighs in with a fine non-obtrusive score and Mike Nichols directing his first film reveals a sure touch and a sympathy with the text. Forty years on it stands up beautifully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Incredible Directorial Debuts of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most incredible directorial debuts of all time, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf was the peak of Mike Nichols's metamorphosis from half of sketch comedy act Nichols &amp; May to a class A film director with an initialized style of fixed camera shots and the furthest extension of the capabilities of the cast. Before Nichols went through his ruts, his career's early explosion of greatness with films like The Graduate and Catch-22 began with this harrowingly confrontational conversation piece involving two couples, an elder one played by composed and elegant yet dark and methodical Richard Brooks and Liz Taylor, who is still as beautiful and emotional as ever, and a younger couple played by George Segal in possibly his best performance and Sandy Dennis surely in her best performance. The elder couple hosts the younger, playing games with them, which are savage verbal attacks against one or two of the others at the party.What is so very sad about this emotionally overwhelming story is that despite the clear indication of hatred, hostility, and vindictive precision combat between Brooks and Taylor, they love each other implicitly. How else could they have brought themselves through emotional tempests that would separate nearly all other couples to the point where their existence is so insulated and unbearable to the outside world? They live comfortably in each other's pain.The Virginia Woolf gimmick seems affected, especially when Richard Brooks unexpectedly dances in circles with Sandy Dennis. However, if one happens to know the subjective reason why Edward Albee gave his play the title and the recurring meter, the last line is incredibly powerful:"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?" "I am, George. I am."Though whether one understands this or not, Elizabeth Taylor radiates with such childlike emotion that it's difficult not to tear up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic in Every Sense of the Word!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the ultimate for Burton/Taylor fans.The film is an adaptation of Edward Albee's play about a university couple whose relationship is so complex, upon first look, it appears they cannot bear each other. But look closer - much closer. While they seem to have a horrible way of helping each other survive (and believe me, that is what, at least HALF of this is about) they indeed do each other a service by punishing each other for whatever it is each of them feel guilty about.But this is a psychological thriller at its best. The dialog is crisp, biting, caustic, strange, compelling, honest, brutal and thoroughly engrossing. It is disturbing and not for the faint-hearted but is a fascinating look in the dark recesses that make up some relationships. It also demands that you pay close attention to the dialog because this is where you truly find out exactly what this entails.The simple plot deals with two university couples, one young, one not-so-young, who "entertain" each other in the wee hours of the night after a university party. George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) invite a young couple over who just joined the university staff. While George and Martha are old hats at this "banter" they have developed, they draw the young couple into their psychological torture chamber resulting in a riveting but exhausting evening of fun and games. Even by today's standards, this is truly an intricate, disturbing, but thoroughly enjoyable look at what drives some relationships.Oscars went to the women but not the men! Hmmmmmmmmmmm. An even more interesting bit of trivia is that Bette Davis wanted to play this part badly but eventually lost out to Liz. One can only imagine what Martha would have been like in the hands of Bette Davis. And as much as I love Bette, she would have to have been off the chain to match Taylor's ferocity.Classic fate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Revelation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strap yourself in and get ready for one helluva ride! This film is riveting from start to finish. I remember this being on TV when I was a kid, and all I remembered was that it was a bunch of people yelling at each other, and I never wanted to see it again. I'm glad I gave it a second chance. Forty-some odd years later, the depth of the characters absolutely drew me in. This is an intense look at perhaps 12 hours in the life of a marvelously dysfunctional relationship, which the viewer is drawn into in horrifying detail, and finally, a glimpse of the real reasons for the dysfunction. The revelation is Elizabeth Taylor's performance. I had always thought of her as a bit of Hollywood fluff with no real talent, but she really proved me wrong here. Her performance is one of the best I've ever seen, and the other three main characters are equally compelling. Everything about this film is superb, the acting, the pacing, the stunning black and white cinematography and the use of camera angles. This should be required viewing for all film students.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly! I expected the movie to be great given the number of awards it had bagged (one of a very few films to be nominated for all the categories in the academy awards). But it turned out to be a movie of a bad taste. May be it was a rebellious movie of its day where Hollywood was conservative about the use of language in the movies. But that alone can't be a qualification for the movie. A professor of history(Burton) and his wife(Taylor)invite young couple to their home.When the young couple come, they start venting their anger on each other and on the couples as well. They decide to torment the couple's mind. The real person who's tormented is the viewer for his decision to watch the movie. Elizabeth Taylor acts well as a chronic alcoholic.There ends the positives of the movie. If someone asks me who's afraid of Virginia woolf, i would definitely say "I am" !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hyperactive film version of Albee's one set play, over-directed by Mike Nichols starts on a high note with vitriolic humor and incisive dialog, but loses steam when it becomes more serious and sentimental, and by the end it begins to feel pointless, contrived and prolonged. Liz Taylor makes the most of her showy role for which she won her second Oscar, but like the film, she's most entertaining in the first half. George Segal and Sandy Dennis provide good support while Richard Burton gives the film's best, and most nuanced performance. It's a rare opportunity to see him in a contemporary role that's worthy of his talent, and along with Becket(64) and The Spy Who Came in from the Cold(65), it's one of his best film performances. As with Nichols' The Graduate(67) there's less here than meets the eye, and what meets the eye is often striking thanks to Haskell Wexler's b/w photography. Nichols is clever, not profound, and the same could be said for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie represents the story of two married people who have the problem with their mind. After they got drunk, they talked a lot about their stories that are nondiegetic elements. Beside,they spoke very sarcastically because of the effect of alcohol. In the scene that he took the gun and wanted to shoot his wife is exciting; the director select the low background music with low amplitude that is opposite with the high loudness of conversation because the director tries to imply that the people in conversation were focusing on their talking. In addition, the director uses camera to zoom in her face and switch back to the shot of shooting. Furthermore, almost every scene is photographed in the building, so the director uses medium long shot and medium close-up shot to run the movie more smooth. In the dancing scene, the audience also sees the example of Dutch-angle shot. Finally, the scene that she left her husband; the director put the next shot(flashback) by using face out and face in the previous shot that increases the continuity between two shots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Illusion of love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is really uncommon to find a Hollywood movie where from the very first moment, you absolutely hate the main characters of the movie. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a movie like that. From the very first scene, I was already boiling because Martha, played by Elizabeth Taylor, was so unbearably frustrating character and I have lived with people like that by myself. The other people of the movie feel more humane at start, but as the drinking goes on and they reveal their true colors, there are no characters to be liked in the movie. It is like a roller coaster ride, the way the characters just change their sides. At one moment you feel like liking the character, the next moment you hate him/her again and when there's a little break in the shout fight and the character tries to talk about feelings, you feel like liking the character again until the illusion is crushed in the next moment when the shouting goes on again. It takes a lot of talent from both the director and the actors to keep this furious feeling and the tension of the characters alive in every scene of the movie. Although 131 runtime for a movie like this feels a little bit too long but on the other hand it mirrors how long the never ending fighting goes on and how numb it makes both audience and the characters. It is no wonder Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is counted as such a classic. Rarely have Hollywood films and their love stories been as furious and cold as this one is. Even after decades, it is still as strong mockery of Romeo and Juliet as it was when it was released. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf really shows that the everlasting love is only an illusion and one single drunken night is enough to bring that illusion down. Snap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An uncomfortable and difficult story pulled off with utmost professionalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filming a play poses a great challenge. Filming "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" marks a whole other level of challenge, especially in the hands of a rookie director as Mike Nichols was at the time. But on the shoulders of stars and real life husband and wife Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, "Virginia Woolf" commands attention amid all its source material's unpleasantness.Edward Albee's play is a sickening portrait of American suburbia, of people feeling compelled to create illusions of themselves in the public domain because of a childish inability to cope with their faults or private disgraces. After a party, George (Burton) and Martha (Taylor) are one such couple who decide to trade jabs at each other after Martha invites a younger couple from the party over for a nightcap. Little do Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis) know that they're to be an audience and then some for George and Martha's perverse "games."George and Martha are downright nasty, exposing each other's secrets, assaulting each other verbally and physically and coming off as absolutely detestable to the audience. Amazing, however, how that doesn't injure Taylor and Burton's performances. They're so impeccably good at being awful people. Taylor is something else as the childish and brash Martha. At first it's George we feel bad for because she's so immature, but then George begins to insult the guests and has a knack for exacting his revenge on Martha with verbal cunning.All four actors earned Academy Award nominations (two won) and unarguably, this does deserve to be one of the only films of all time to have its entire cast nominated. The mousy (as George accurate calls her) Dennis stands out in particular as the brandy-guzzling Honey, the innocent character who more or less gets spat on during the film.Nichols chooses a heck of a debut picture. Starting his career and a master comedian improviser, he started directing for the stage and clearly found no trouble adapting to film. He uses a very Hitchcockian approach to the film, carefully choosing very wide above shots and getting very close and even zooming in more tense moments. He certainly understood that capturing these performances and highlight the cast's strengths was priority number one."Virginia Woolf" has and will continue to rub first-timers the wrong way. It's a tough story to enjoy even with the moments of levity, but Nichols and the cast do Albee's work great justice and effectively pull off the mask for the audience as the playwright initially intended.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Albee's exploration of a volatile marriage is successfully brought to the screen by Nichols, in a remarkable debut. Creating a gritty atmosphere and eliciting excellent performances, Nichols fares far better in adapting a play than Fred Zinnemann did the same year with "A Man for All Seasons." Taylor gives the performance of her career as the alcoholic wife, earning a well-deserved Oscar. Burton is equally good as her husband, dealing with his inadequacies. Segal and Dennis round out the terrific cast. The dialog, often quite funny, is expertly delivered by all four actors. Perhpas the bickering gets to be a bit too much after a while, but generally quite rewarding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like nothing I've ever seen before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff is a film that I can honestly say is like nothing you've ever seen before. It's like horror meets melodrama. The best I can do for a synopsis is it's about a couple who invites another couple over for an evening's entertainment but instead of playing pictionary, they subject the couple and each other to a series of twisted psychological games. Why the younger couple voluntarily staying through these twisted psychological games for the duration of the evening was clearly the screenwriter/playwright's biggest challenge and he partially succeeds in setting things up so that the couple is partially captive to the situation. I'm willing to excuse the screenwriter for this because it's such a fascinating piece.The dialogue is stylized to the point that it has virtually no frame of reference in reality. I say virtually because if you came from a household that dysfunctional, you probably would have committed suicide by now, but if you haven't and you saw this film you would relate but for the rest of us, it's more of an abstraction. Aside from the quality of the dialogue the reason to watch this film, is the way these four actors take such nonsensical words and actions and make it come to life. Sandy Dennis and Elizabeth Taylor won Oscars for their roles and George Segal (Just Shoot Me) and Richard Burton were nominated and every one of them deserved the praise. Burton, in particular, was so convincingly mad, it's just emotionally draining to watch him spin emotional circles around logic on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Nichol's fantastic directing debut is a strange one, yet this is the type of movie that i can see why it is called a classic. It is just over two hours long, yet the most action we see in it is someone pushing someone else into a table. The rest is all dialogue, and combined with some of the best acting ever caught on camera, it makes for some powerful cinema. At times, it is hard to follow, but simply watching Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton go at it is not so entertaining as it is breathtaking to see two great actors trade snarling comments about each other (the fact they are married in the film and were married in real life at the time only adds to the drama). The two supporting actors are good, though not as fleshed out as we might like them to be. Still, after a whole night of alcohol and attacking each other verbally, it makes for one wild ride; certainly one not everybody will want to take. For those willing to, however, it is remarkable to witness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harrowing film masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After basically making fools of themselves in the hilariously bad SANDPIPER (which nonetheless popular with audiences at the time), the Burtons made what is arguably the comeback of the decade with the blistering masterpiece WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? (1966). In his first film, director Mike Nichols immediately announced himself as a major force to be reckoned with and as one of the most promising directors of the decade (and he would continue to make good on that promise throughout the decades). The film should be remembered not only as the taboo-shattering masterwork that it is, but also as one of the most taunt, biting, and intense dramas ever produced. Even forty years after its premiere, this film is certainly not light entertainment.Although her weight gain and garish make-up is not enough to disguise her natural beauty, Taylor is frighteningly effective in a career-best performance. Burton is even better in a disturbing portrayal of the emasculated male bent on revenge. The fit and gorgeous George Segal and loopy Sandy Dennis are perfectly cast as the mismatched couple who subject themselves to the reign of psychological terror unleashed by George and Martha. Both Taylor and Dennis deservedly won Oscars, and Burton and Segal were absolutely robbed of the awards for their sensational work. The film pushed the limits of the production code at the time, and (along with 1966's BLOW-UP) paved the way for the "new" rating system of "G," "PG," "R," and "X." The film deservedly won raves from critics, and was nominated for 13 Oscars (winning 5). The film was smash hit at the box office, coming in as the third-highest grosser of the year. This film has lost none of its gut-wrenching power over the years.</fullReview>

I know that this was a small budget shooting, but I can't believe that this movie could became famous and also won 5 Oscars. Richard Burton should have won one, he deserved it. The whole movie suggest the fact that marriage is bad, and all you get from that is wrangling, suffering and pain. A good drama holds a twist, which we only dawn on in the end of the movie.

		<fullReview>It is difficult to believe that it has been 50 years since Edward Albee's 1963 eviscerating play 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Open on Broadway, and even more difficult to realize that three years later, in 1966, this cinematic version, with a screenplay by Ernest Lehman and directed brilliantly by Mike Nichols brought to the public's attention the special gifts of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as the alcoholic couple. It is a remarkable film and one that seems equally fine when we return to the DVD version so many years later.George and Martha are a middle aged married couple, whose charged relationship is defined by vitriolic verbal battles, which underlies what seems like an emotional dependence upon each other. This verbal abuse is fueled by an excessive consumption of alcohol. George being an associate History professor in a New Carthage university where Martha's father is the President adds an extra dimension to their relationship. Late one Saturday evening after a faculty mixer, Martha invites Nick and Honey, an ambitious young Biology professor new to the university and his mousy wife, over for a nightcap. As the evening progresses, Nick and Honey, plied with more alcohol, get caught up in George and Martha's games of needing to hurt each other and everyone around them. The ultimate abuse comes in the form of talk of George and Martha's unseen sixteen year old son, whose birthday is the following day. That final moment, captured by Haskell Wexler's bracing black and white cinematography and underlined by Alex North's musical scoring, when the title of the play is asked by George in question from to the devastated Martha and she answers 'I am' is a moment of cinematic history that deserves celebrating.Times change and films change and the public seems more interested in massive superhero explosive 3D extravaganzas to avoid the doings of the time. But films such as this remind us how powerful small ensemble screen acting can be. This is not an escapist outing, this is an examination of how people act to influence, enhance and destroy each other. It demands we think as well as react. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a film directed by Mike Nichols. The screenplay by Ernest Lehman is an adaptation of the play of the same title by Edward Albee. It stars Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton with George Segal and Sandy Dennis.First staged on Broadway in 1962 with Uta Hagen and Arthur Hill, Edward Albee's play was adapted for the screen by Ernest Lehman, who managed to retain virtually all of Albee's scatological epithets.George is an alcoholic college professor; Martha is his virago of a wife. George and Martha know just how to push each other's buttons, with George having a special advantage: he need only mention the couple's son to send Martha into orbit. This evening, the couple's guests are Nick, a junior professor, and Honey, Nick's child-like wife. After an evening of sadistic "fun and games," the truth about George and Martha's son comes to light.Keen adaptation and handsome production by Ernest Lehman, outstanding direction by Mike Nichols in his feature debut, and four topflight performances score an artistic bullseye. And in its forthright dealing with the play, this becomes one of the most scathingly honest American films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time Edward Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" is revived on Broadway or done in regional theater, the critics and the chatrooms at some point get around to the movie. Mike Nichol's film version is still today the yardstick by which all productions of this harrowing play are based. I was privileged to see Estelle Parsons and George Noble as George and Martha at Buffalo's Arena Stage many years ago. They were fantastic. Film or play, it's the kind of thing that needs to be seen with an audience to absorb its true power.George and Martha (Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor) are a drunken, miserable couple who have to entertain a new college teacher, Nick, (George Segal) and his mousy wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) one very late night after a party. Martha's father heads up the college where George and Nick teach.Despite their obvious sniping at one another, there's a method to George's and Martha's madness -- they survive by playing games that put them into a fantasy world. And therein lies the reason for their bitterness, and the line, "We couldn't" spoken to Nick toward the end of the film tells us why, underneath all of it, this is a real love story.This film was a tour de force for Taylor and Burton, who are simply fabulous in their roles. Taylor is bitchy, funny, vulnerable, and sad, and Burton is perfect as the beaten down George who nevertheless plays the game very well indeed.Nick and Honey are young; Nick is ambitious and somewhat manipulative, but not as manipulative as his frail wife, who has some deep-seated problems. In vino veritas, as the night becomes day, and the emotionally exhausting party finally breaks up.Taylor in real life had a fun, trashy side to her, and she uses it well here. Nichols' direction is very sound, and despite the length of the film, it goes very quickly.What is truth, what is illusion, what is a lie -- like Nick, you'll be confused at times, but it's worth the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly Made But What Ugly Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) *** (out of 4) Technically brilliant but oh so ugly tale of an aging married couple (Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton) who invite a young couple (George Segal, Sandy Dennis) to their house for drinks and soon the bitterness of their lives are pouring out through rage and alcohol. If there was ever a case of a three-star film being called a masterpiece then this here would be the perfect example because there's so much brilliance in this movie that it's impossible not to pay close attention and really admire everything going on. At the same time there's no question that these four characters are such ugly, vile and repulsive that the 129-minute running time feels twice as long because it's simply not very pleasant spending that much time with such characters. WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? contains some of the greatest acting I've seen in my life, the direction is marvelous and the B&amp;W cinematography is also among the greatest I've ever seen. Saying all of that you'd think this was a movie I'd want to rush back and watch again but that's hardly the case. This is a rather hard film to judge because on one hand I'm happy that the filmmakers were brave enough to show these ugly characters as they are but on the other hand it really prevents one from "enjoying" the movie. That might sound like a dumb contradiction but when "The End" finally came up on the screen I was happy and I'd also say that I wish the movie was thirty-minutes shorter because it was driving me mad having to listen to these people and their sick games that they were playing. I think my dislike of the characters could also be viewed as another major plus for the filmmakers because it takes a great deal of talent to make a viewer feel this way. The performances by Taylor, who won an Oscar, and Burton are two of the greatest I've ever seen. It's rather remarkable just to sit and watch the two greats do their thing. The movie is filmed in what seems like real-time to give the movie an almost documentary like style. By doing this it really aids the performances because you can see the anger and rage quietly and at times quickly building up before the explosion finally happens. Just watch as the two slowly pick at one another, know which buttons to push and then out of no where this demented rage comes flowing through them. I'm not sure if Taylor and Burton were simply brilliant actors at being able to bring this out of each other or if their real-life relationship helped build this up. Either way, the two of them are simply marvelous here and both rank as some of the greatest performances I've seen. Segal and Oscar-winner Dennis are also very good, although at some points I felt Dennis was a tad bit over-the-top. The cinematography by Haskell Wexler is some of the greatest you'll see as well. It really makes the film seem like a Gothic horror movie or a film noir from the 40s. This dark look really helps capture the ugliness of the characters as well as bring out the dark tone. Nichols direction is flawless as he has no troubles with the material even though I might say he was too good at what he was doing. This was an extremely difficult film to sit through with the ugly characters and frank subject matter. Normally I wouldn't recommend a film like this but the performances are just so grand that it's impossible not to take notice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see the IMDb viewer rating for VIRGINIA WOOLF is over 8. I think this a tad high. All of these marathon-talk fest theatrical tour-de-forces have a built-in implausibility factor working against them. The more the characters drink throughout the night, the wittier and more ingeniously cutthroat their remarks and power-play games become (real life doesn't work like this). Plus, in this instance, in order to make the play "cinematic," Mike Nichols' direction (typical for him)is too "cute" by half and the performances, with one sterling exception, are overrated. Taylor's stab at Martha is bravely, ballsy enough, but she's too limited, vocally, to give the part variety. Dennis is ridiculously mannered as the mousy wife and George Segal, as Nick, is, well, George Segal. But the one aspect that sets this film apart from all of Nichols' other pictures and gives it a kernel of authenticity is Richard Burton's scintillating dramatic turn as the "ineffectual" (ineffectual, my foot!) professor of the English department and husband of Martha, George. This is one of those hallowed instances in the cinema where the role fits the soul of the actor to such a T that you feel you're being granted access into the inner sanctum of what prompts his very being into action. EVEN BEFORE HE OPENS HIS MOUTH. For my money, the last three great acting jobs of the classic Hollywood period were: Bill Holden in THE WILD BUNCH (1969), Brando in REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE ('67) and Burton in this (1966). Pike Bishop granted Holden an authority he had never showed before; Major Pemberton afforded Brando's imagination to soar in a tightly enclosed, dream cast atmosphere, and George allowed Burton to dive beneath the surface mystique of his own voice to reveal its dramatic impetus. "The only thing in life is language," the actor once confessed to an interviewer. "Not love. Language. Not anything else."The quote could have come out of the mouth of Albee's bitter, self-loathing protagonist but was said by the "singer" himself in a marvelous, off-guarded moment. It is part and parcel of this peerless personification of words on paper into something approximating flesh and blood life.Rating guide: 6 for the picture10 for Burton Composite for Film: 7.5P.S. TCM showed the movie twice already in the past two weeks. Is VIRGINIA WOOLF in line to replace IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE as the nation's Yuletide, holiday season event?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton play a husband and wife who have worn their marriage down to the bare threads. Tonight, they are drunk, and are entertaining two young guests after a party. We watch as the night winds down.I don't really like this film. There is one scene I like, where Burton and his young colleague are discussing science and science fiction and how biology may some day be ultimately used to engineer human genetics. But the rest of the film has dialogue that amounts to little more than marital griping and plenty of repetition.As far as it all goes, it is done beautifully, and the black and white aids the crisp intensity of it all. But this film was based on a play, and a play is probably what it should have remained. It's dialogue and little more -- the filming did nothing to enhance it beyond provide the story with a wider audience. If this is Elizabeth Taylor's best performance, all it shows is that she can be an obnoxious drunk. If that's Oscar-worthy, so be it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those unusual films one sees when boredom applauds us for having insomnia. The movie is called " Who's Afraid of Virgina Woolf " and is selected by many as a good film. Not so by this reviewer, who believes it's exceptional. On a particular night in December, I sat down in a quiet, square room and without once stopping for snacks or breaks watched it's entirety. The movie is in stark Black and white and is the story is of a middle aged married couple, George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) who decide to spend the evening with their neighbors Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis). Burton plays a boisterous, frustrated and angry professor and Taylor plays an equally angry, aging overweight, hen-pecking wife. Using what seems to be their home and subsequent neighborhood, the bickering pair are joined by their neighbors Nick and Honey, a young delusional and often confrontational couple, as they peruse the backyard stage. What has since been described as a nocturnal 'talk-a-thon' the four dissect observations on life, sex and personal opinions. The splendid cast make for interesting viewing and not without merit. Burton is superb using his dramatic stage style, wit and cynicism to make his point, while Taylor parries with vocal fluctuations and commentary. Segal and Dennis are seen as overwhelmed by the couple's attack, but emerge triumphant as superior characters. A good film if you're patient enough to endure the marathon movie. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never Understood It, Never Will . . . But I Love It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was nine and it confused the crap out of me. In the ensuing years I have watched it, written papers about it, discussed it in classes . . . and it STILL confuses the crap out of me. Do George and Martha love or hate each other? Why don't Nick and Honey make a polite excuse and run like hell? What's up with the kid they keep talking about? No one in this movie acts like a rational human being, but that's the point . . . there's no such thing as a rational human being. People are cruel, petty, manipulative liars, and the only thing worse than having to live with another person is having to live alone. It's not an uplifting movie, but it is viciously honest and ultimately quite moving. John Waters has said that if you remain dry-eyed during the finale of this film, you have no heart. I agree with him.The plot of this film is so simple, it barely qualifies as such: a middle-aged academic couple invites a young academic couple over for drinks. They spend the night drinking and arguing. Bam. That's it. I couldn't understand what was at stake when I first saw this flick. Then again, the concept of sado-masochism had yet to penetrate my prepubescent world. Martha is a drunken, middle-aged shrew who enjoys tormenting George, her wimpy husband. Why does he put up with it? The funhouse-mirror image of George and Martha are Nick, a handsome, brilliant Biology professor, and Honey, his mousy, slightly dim wife. What is this stud doing with this frump? We learn the answers to these questions, and they're horrifying. Well, they're horrifying if you assume the characters are telling the truth. I've never been sure. Whatever, it's even more fun to watch than it is to discuss. This was director Mike Nichols' first film, and his theatrical roots are pretty obvious -- with a few notable exceptions, like that wrenching last shot, the entire story (such as it is) is told through dialog. But it's some of the best dialog ever written, so you can be glad Nichols didn't distract from it with a bunch of cinematic techniques like the ones he would use in "The Graduate" a year later. Since the focus is so mercilessly on the actors and their words, this is one of the few films in which hammy overacting is not only forgivable, it's absolutely necessary, and this cast is up to the challenge.Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton didn't always pick films that wisely ("Boom," anyone?), but here they are to be applauded for using their clout to bring Edward Albee's Broadway sensation (alas no Pulitzer) to the big screen. And for once in the history of their long, often painful collaboration, they're both brilliant. George and Martha are ugly people, inside and out, and Hollywood's most glittering couple manages to capture all of that delicious hideousness. Gorgeous actresses often frump themselves up on screen so they can get Oscars ("The Hours," anyone?), but Liz earned this statuette. Martha is, in the words of her loving husband, a "Satanic bitch," but her hatefulness masks a lot of pain, and Liz lets us know that. Burton, Taylor's husband at the time (fourth of seven, I believe), was a macho blowhard whose histrionics ruined a lot of movies ("The Night of the Iguana," anyone?), but here he makes the bold choice of playing George as an impotent but bitter whipping boy, a wimp with a will to power. Notice the smug satisfaction he takes in needling poor, stupid Honey, the only creature on Earth more defenseless than himself. Maybe Nichols explained the role to him, or maybe Burton was smart enough to figure out the gay subtext that so many critics have read into the play and movie, but for once Dick actually lives up to the "great actor" reputation that mystifies anyone who has ever seen "Exorcist II: The Heretic." (Caveat: he was also good in "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold.") George Segal, never known for his dramatic intensity, is fine as creepy Nick and Sandy Dennis is flat-out brilliant as pathetic little Honey. From her screechy, overeager first line ("oh, he's a WONDERFUL man") through her weird drunken dance right up to her meek assist in Martha's ghastly final comeuppance ("like a good boy!"), Dennis hits every wrong note and is just as deserving of Oscar gold as the film's formidable leading lady. Dennis had an erratic career, and it sounds like she didn't have the greatest life, but here she displayed some serious star potential. Or at least she did in 1960s Hollywood, which still had room for homely, quirky stars (Streisand, anyone?) and serious films without explosions and trite moral lessons. I'm trying to imagine Tom Cruise and Katie Homes doing this movie, and the idea is sickening. We live in an era of plastic, self-congratulatory celebrity "actors" who couldn't hold Liz Taylor's girdle. Sigh.</fullReview>

From the first moment on we are captured by her, taken on a destructive journey to the bare bones of humanity and human emotions. Director Nichols makes the right decision to trust only his actors and abstain from any other effect. Elizabeth Taylor leads a cast of four equally wonderful actors in top form. Please, do yourself a favor, don't miss this. The performances are breathtaking and inspiring, the dialogs razor-sharp and painful and the ending is one of the saddest but most satisfying in film history. I bow to this achievement!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Harrowing, Disturbing Film with a Dazzling Performance from Liz Taylor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard many reports that the screen version of Edward Albee's Pulitzer-Prize-winning play greatly dilutes the content and language of the original text, blunting some of its emotional impact. Well, if this is the blunted version, I don't know if I'm prepared for the original.Richard Burton (who I've never really liked as an actor, but who I have to admit does brilliant work here) and Elizabeth Taylor (in the definitive performance of her career) go at each other like two inmates in a prison brawl, and the results are devastating. To see two people who obviously have a deep bond but who are so intent on deeply hurting each other is enough to make your skin crawl. At the root of their misery is a child, or rather the lack of one, and unable to deal with their own emotional crises, they instead turn their troubles into a grotesque game, where hurting each other becomes perversely the only thing that brings them comfort, because it's less scary than the prospect of facing the skeletons they've packed away in the closets. Burton's George is a loathsome character, a nasty yet beaten man who seems nearly inhuman in his ability to repress any show of true emotion. Taylor's Martha is one of the most fascinating female creations ever put on the stage or the screen, and Taylor tears into the role as if her life depended on it. Ultimately, it's her who will break your heart, this woman who has turned into something everyone detests in an attempt to wring from her husband a sign that she and their marriage still matter to him. I'll never forget the feeling of hollowed-out despair this movie left me with after my first viewing.George Segal and Sandy Dennis play the young couple who suffer the force of George and Martha's attack. They serve as reminders of what George and Martha perhaps once were, while George and Martha serve as warnings of what the younger couple could become.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know the play so can only go by this brilliantly written and acted adaptation. What happens when people can't meet society's expectations, or don't "fit"? Some might try to play "their" role anyway and might even try to deceive themselves (Human Stain, Far from Heaven, e.g.). The alternative, "going your own way" may not be easy (or profitable). The play was pre-Civil Rights, but more broadly, any ideal may be unattainable (even Elizabeth Taylor gets old). The title is a punch line to a joke we never hear. Maybe analogous to life and its meaning. Ultimately, the joke's on us no matter who we are. Maybe the object of the game is to know that but laugh anyway (the interplay between Taylor and Burton is hilarious). And, like George and Martha, it's probably good to find someone else to laugh with. Almost like a spy story; you never know when the characters are pretending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great movie that is hellishly funny or heart-breakingly sad, depending on what YOU feel at the time. It asks you to bring your life's experiences to it and feed those experiences into the movie. The small cast is superb, the claustrophobic atmosphere at Amherst, Mass., makes the stakes for a professor and his wife, the President's daughter, all too great and too small. The baggage they toss back and forth is exhausting and exhilerating as they spar, punch, lay back on the ropes, spar and punch some more and....give up before the knockout blow. Then they hold each other in the middle of the ring as exhausted fighters often do. This film is also voyeuristic as one can't help believing -- true or not -- that one is peeking into some intimate moment of the Burtons. We want to turn away, but can't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterclass in acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie based on a stage-play; While this is not my most favorite combination it still can work out really well on film. And even though this movie does feel very stagy, it still is one of those movies that work out really well.It's not an enjoyable movie to watch and even one that is quite hard to get through at times but it ultimately is a very rewarding viewing experience. The acting, the characters, the directing, the story and its progress, it all ensures that "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" is an unique and powerful movie experience.This movie foremost is a real character driven one. It's mostly set at the same locations and all that the movie basically involves is the characters speaking back and forth to each other. They do this in a very snappy way and love to get on each others backs. In order for this to all work out as well as it did, the movie needed to have some great actors in it. And with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton the movie of course has some great leading actors, as well as a legendary screen couple. They appeared in countless movies together and were married twice to each other in real life.It's no big secret that their relationship and marriage was far from perfect and peachy. In that regard they are perfectly cast in this movie. It's imaginable that they put some of their relationship into this movie. They are bickering constantly and calling each other out, all fueled by far too much alcohol and the presence of a younger visiting couple, played by George Segal and Sandy Dennis.I of course have no illusions, this is often how married life is like. Of course maybe not as extreme and in the same fashion as portrayed in this movie but overall it still feels like a fair and plausible relationship, between two middle aged persons, who are more or less stuck together and to each other. The movie and some of its situations should be very recognizable to some long time married couples.But it also is really the way the story gets told by the director Mike Nichols that make this movie and its story work out so well. It's story has a slow buildup but the movie itself is actually never a slow one and also doesn't feel that way. Quite an accomplishment for a movie that is being over 2 hours long, is mostly set at the same location and only features 4 characters in it. This actually was Mike Nichols' directorial debut, believe it or not. But judging by this movie, he probably already had some theatrical experience, prior to shooting this movie.The movie got also loaded with praise and also was one of the front runners at that year's Academy Awards. As a matter of fact, it got nominated in every category it was eligible for and it's also one of three movies with only 4 credited actors in it, who all got nominated for an Oscar as well. The movie eventually took home 5 of the awards but lost out on all the most important ones, such as the ones for best picture, writing and directing. It did won an Oscar for its cinematography though, which pleases me, seeing how much this movie deserved that win. It's the camera-work, together with its editing, that often really adds to the movie its pace. Besides, it's great to see they didn't took a static approach, which was perhaps the safest and more common approach to take to a movie of this kind. The movie does really has some special shot sequences in it, that are great to look at and definitely really adds something to the movie.A great movie and not just because of its acting!9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special Edition DVD Showcases Albee's Vitriolic, Take-No-Prisoners Marital Combat Zone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward Albee's vituperative play about marital warfare, an acknowledged classic even during its first run, came to the screen with searing fervor by an unlikely combination of talents at that time - stage director Mike Nichols helming his first film, screenwriter Ernest Lehman coming off the big box office treacle of "The Sound of Music", and two mega-stars who were more famous as notorious tabloid-saturated lovers than as character actors. The highly successful 1966 adaptation of the Broadway hit was considered quite daring because of its frank portrayal of a sadomasochistic marriage and the frequent use of profanity throughout. The groundbreaking film also signaled the end of the Hayes Code, which held a censorship stranglehold over Hollywood productions since 1934. Now in a new 2006 two-disc DVD set, the movie seems marginally tamer now, but the lacerating wit of Albee's fearless dialogue and the powerful performances still make this a great picture albeit not a joyous one.The simple-sounding story focuses on the aptly named George and Martha, a middle-aged associate history professor and his older, shrewish wife. Staggering home after an alcohol-fueled faculty party, they trade their usual barbs and then are joined by Nick, a young assistant math professor, and his wife Honey, whom a drunken Martha had invited over for a late-night nightcap. Despite the late hour, Nick readily accepts the invitation since Martha's father is the university president. What ensues is a series of vitriolic cat-and-mouse scenes of tension and black comedy among the four principals. In fact, there is no one else in the movie other than a roadside café owner and a waitress in the background. Delusions and deceptions contaminate the often nasty comments, and the conversations strip away the characters' self-protective veneers. With his debut film, Nichols manages to open up the story with scenes in the front yard and at the café, but he maintains the claustrophobic atmosphere necessary for the primal instincts to ignite and fester among the quartet.Haskell Wexler's textured black-and-white cinematography and Sam O'Steen's edgy editing add immeasurably to the often harrowing proceedings. However, what remains most memorable is the fine cast guided by Nichols. Even though Elizabeth Taylor is nearly two decades too young to play the 52-year old Martha, she throws herself into the harridan with abandon. Overweight with a gray wig and bosom-heaving outfits, Taylor makes Martha flamboyantly vulgar and sadly pitiable at the same time. It's her best movie work by miles. Richard Burton is more ideally cast as George, who begins as a despondent, beaten-upon husband but soon matches his wife's emotional blackmail ploys with cyclonic force. Out of a dozen professional attempts, this is the only time Taylor and Burton seem to justify the intrigue of their off-screen exploits. In her first major role, Sandy Dennis is impressive as the fragile Honey liberating herself with alcohol. Perhaps because Nick is the least developed role, George Segal comes off as the most pallid of the foursome.The print is clean and nicely presented in a letterbox format. The DVD extras start out strong with two alternate commentary tracks - the first a newly recorded one with Nichols and director Steven Soderbergh, the second with Wexler that was recorded for the Laserdisc release several years ago. Nichols and Wexler both provide invaluable insights into the production, while Soderbergh seems rather superfluous with his fan reactions to the movie. The second disc has two new featurettes - the twenty-minute "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?: A Daring Work of Raw Excellence", which discusses the production in retrospect, and the ten-minute "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?: Too Shocking for Its Time" about the censorship problems around the film and how it kick-started the rating system still in use today.Also on the second disc are two archival pieces of lesser interest - an eight-minute 1966 interview with Nichols on NBC's "Today Show", which shows the filmmaker as less than illuminating at this point in his career, and a superficial 1975 TV special called "Elizabeth Taylor: An Intimate Portrait". Hosted by a meandering Peter Lawford, the latter program has interviews with Rock Hudson, directors Vincente Minnelli and Richard Brooks and even Taylor's American mother Sara but no involvement from Taylor herself, who is seen only in archival footage. Of more interest is footage from Dennis's screen test opposite Roddy McDowall, showing the actress already well prepared for her complex role. There are four trailers included for the films included in the newly released Taylor-Burton DVD set, of which "Woolf" is surprisingly the weakest. The others in the collection are 1963's "The VIPs", 1965's "The Sandpiper" and 1967's "The Comedians".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an absolutely flawless film version of Edward Albee's brilliant play. George (Richard Burton) is a disillusioned, middle-aged history professor at a small New England college, Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) is his vile, alcoholic wife. One night after a faculty gathering, they invite a younger couple (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) over for drinks, and before the evening's end, every raw nerve is ripped savagely open, the blood flowing as freely as the gin &amp; tonics. Without a doubt, one of the best films ever made (possibly THE best) and a prime example of what happens when film makers adapting a play for the screen actually treat it with respect. Rather than trying to concoct a screenplay, the original play was used, and as a result, nearly all of Albee's exquisite dialogue was retained. Project was further served by Mike Nichols' direction (his debut) and George Wexler's striking cinematography.</fullReview>

I am not a fan of Mike Nichols' style but in this movie it does seem to work, he picks up on the brooding and ruminating, scathing, vicious bubbling inside the lead characters. He gets right in their faces and you can just peer inside their eyes and there you find the anger and hate and disappointment that Albee was writing about.Burton and Taylor make this movie come alive, their intensity is superb. I think Nichols is able to capture this extraordinarily well, it is too bad that "The Graduate" was such a disappointment. "The Graduate" is highly disorganized and desultory compared to this movie. I will add though that this is very difficult to watch because of the hate and unpleasantry which is the focus and parade of the story. Still, it is worth looking into.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Burton's best films together...score: 10+ (out of 10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of a turbulent marriage has never been depicted in more graphic detail in cinematic history as in Edward Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" Burton (who also should have received an Oscar for Best Actor) and Taylor (Best Actress Oscar) are at their zenith together as the tormented husband-wife couple. Sandy Dennis (Best Supporting Actress Oscar) and George Segal give excellent supporting performances. I must admit that I have never seen such great performances, especially Burton and Taylor, who recite their lines so perfectly...even Shakespeare would have wept. Score: 10+ (out of 10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far the ultimate for Burton/Taylor fans. The film is an adaptation of Edward Albee's play about a university couple whose relationship is so complex, upon first look, it appears they cannot bear each other. But look closer - much closer. While they seem to have a horrible way of helping each other survive (and believe me, that is what, at least HALF of this is about) they indeed do each other a service by punishing each other for whatever it is each of them feel guilty about.But this is a psychological thriller at its best. The dialog is crisp, biting, caustic, strange, compelling, honest, brutal and thoroughly engrossing. It is disturbing and not for the faint-hearted but is a fascinating look in the dark recesses that make up some relationships. It also demands that you pay close attention to the dialog because this is where you truly find out exactly what this entails.The simple plot deals with two university couples, one young, one not-so-young, who "entertain" each other in the wee hours of the night after a university party. George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) invite a young couple over who just joined the university staff. While George and Martha are old hats at this "banter" they have developed, they draw the young couple into their psychological torture chamber resulting in a riveting but exhausting evening of fun and games. Even by today's standards, this is truly an intricate, disturbing, but thoroughly enjoyable look at what drives some relationships.Oscars went to the women but not the men! Hmmmmmmmmmmm. An even more interesting bit of trivia is that Bette Davis wanted to play this part badly but eventually lost out to Liz. One can only imagine what Martha would have been like in the hands of Bette Davis. And as much as I love Bette, she would have to have been off the chain to match Taylor's ferocity.Classic fare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

All of the performances are great, but Elizabeth Taylor reached the pinnacle of her career with her work here, and deservedly won an Oscar. It is no wonder actors worship Mike Nichols; he brings out the best in them all. Hysterically funny in the beginning, then gets very intense for the entire rest of the way.

		<shortDescription>Masterful, heartfelt, riveting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward Albee's play is a spectacular adventure. Intriguing, disturbing, extremely funny, it can sometimes be interpreted very abstractly--being associated more with philosophy and the theatre of the absurd. Stage versions often capture the intensity and wildness of the verbal warfare and abstract games that can be so thrilling to experience. But what can be missing sometimes is the heart and soul of these people in such pain--trying to simply get through their lives. The movie is a revelation. No longer purely theatrically intense, what comes through with absolutely riveting clarity is the tremendous depth of human feelings and emotions buried deep within each of the characters welling up suddenly and unexpectedly with heartbreaking intensity. Elizabeth Taylor's Martha is simply inspired. She is still an alcoholic harridan, but her 3rd act soliloquy which reveals that beneath her cruelty and callousness is an incomprehensible but enduring love for George is astonishing in its impact, heartbreaking in its poignancy. Richard Burton's George is a perfect complement to Martha. He of course has his own subtle brand of cruelty--but the final denouement, and his gentle caressing of Martha shows his own buried love and affection. In the 1960's this film introduced most of the moving-going audience to both George Segal and Sandy Dennis. Distinctive, strong, funny characters--but not caricatures--they were a perfect foil for George and Martha. Special mention should be made of Mike Nichol's direction. He zeroes in on the characters--on their faces--he engages the audience making us feel like we are right there next to each of them, fighting with them, hurting along with them, ultimately caring so intensely for them. The impact is amazing. In the 1960's when the movie first came out--so much of the press and word of mouth seemed to focus on the cursing and fighting in the film. Life magazine even counted exactly how many of each swear word was heard in the film! What they neglected too often to mention was that beneath the then-tremendously shocking dialogue and intensity was heart--pure heart of these painfully pathetic but very real human beings. Our own hearts were open to George and Martha and Nick and Honey with understanding and forgiveness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf? ? A crucial event in the birth of contemporary American theater.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' a famous and shocking black comedy, is based on Edward Albee's scandalous play of the same name. First performed in New York in October of 1962, it captured the New York Drama Critics Circle Award and the Tony Award for the 1962-63 season.A well-constructed piece of work, having philosophical significance in context of the drama of the absurd, it mingles the reality with fantasy to present a savagely satirical attack on spiritual sterility, conformity, hypocrisy and the deep feeling of the tragedy of alienation.We are introduced to George (Richard Burton), a middle-aged history professor, and his acerbic wife, Martha (Elizabeth Taylor).The movie presents an all-night drinking bout of the couple, joined by a vacuous biology professor, Nick (George Seagal), and his wife, Honey (Sandy Dennis).Through the verbal torturing of one another, George and Martha eventually achieve catharsis by exercising their fixation about a nonexistent son.George and Martha, the older couple, had created an imaginary son to sustain themselves. At first drawn together in their horror, Nick and Honey soon find themselves sucked into the spiral of buried resentments and unspoken rage.Yet as the seemingly perfect marriage of Nick and Honey begins to reveal its many flaws, George and Martha find their own twisted bond within the mutual rancor? Nominated for 13 Categories,the movie won 5 Oscars.(Best Actress in a Leading Role?Elizabeth Taylor, Best Actress in a Supporting Role?Sandy Dennis, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration? Richard Sylbert, George James Hopkins, Best Cinematography? Haskell Wexler, Best Costume Design?Irene Sharaff). The performances are brilliant. The on screen chemistry between former real-life couple Taylor and Burton adds sparks to Ernest Lehman's tight script. Haskell Wexler's phenomenal black-and-white cinematography only heightens the emotions on this non-stop two-hour roller coaster. The title of the play was taken from a one-time popular song, 'Who's Afraid of the Big, Bad Wolf?' An exploration of the myth of the American Dream, it impresses us as an exquisite piece, illustrating the significant place of illusion in modern American life. The personal failures of the characters represent the failure of a culture, and the unborn son is symbolic of the American dream of the fulfillment and happiness.The metaphor certainly reaches beyond the immediate to the American scene in general, and the film successfully communicates the ethos of artificiality.The technical dexterity of organizing incidents into a close-knit fabric of emotion and action is superb, and that's what makes this one a gem in American theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the actors were great but the movie was just too excruciating. Maybe that's the point, and I don't mind depressing movies if they make you think, but "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" was just too much. Liz Taylor really blew Richard Burton out of the water. She was something else. And watching Sandy Dennis act like a drunken idiot is really great. A poster recommended just watching her reactions upon a second viewing of the movie - I'd pay attention during a first viewing. I can't recommend this overall, but if you want to watch good actors deliver dialogue, this is for you. I give it five out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Calculated Delirium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this having no idea what it was about (as I think most people do). The "plot" of this movie (if that is what you want to call it) is not easily explained in a blurb on the back of a video cassette box or a description from a friend. To understand what the hell "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" is really about, you need to see it, probably twice. I'm still exhausted from seeing it the first time.Richard Burton is history professor George, living on campus with his brash wife, Martha, played expertly by Elizabeth Taylor. (But more on her later.) The film opens with the two stumbling home from a party, late at night, only to then have guests Nick and Honey (George Segal and Sandy Dennis), a new biology professor and his wife, stop by for a visit, as invited by the couple, though George can't remember that ever happening. From there, drinks are passed around, conversations begin, and personalities come out. And secrets. And a whole long line of character twists that, in the end, destroys each character in their own little ways. That's the best I could do for explaining this plot, and it's weak, at best.Oh, what a movie this is. What a movie, carried solely by almost constant dialogue and interaction between the characters. No real action (well, in the visceral, shoot-em-up sense), but the movie is action-packed, and as many would agree, exhausting. Martha seems to love a good argument, while George is quietly passive. Martha eggs him on, pushes him further and further, dragging their seemingly innocent guests into what ends up being a night of very calculated games and trickery and lies, to the point where you don't know who's telling the truth.While the film is engaging from the start, it takes some time before you are truly sucked in, trapped in this nightmare. I'd say it takes until after the scenes at the bar until you are not just the viewer, but are in the movie, observing very closely, and held tight until the very end. To say this film is "delirious" is an understatement; the movie itself is insane. And it isn't until those haunting scenes once the film returns to George and Martha's house, after the trip to the bar, until you realize how insane this all really is. To say there are any stand-out scenes in the movie would be leaving out the great scene before the stand-out scene, and the one after. This whole film is one great, memorable scene after another. Mike Nichols appeared on "Inside the Actors Studio," in one of those excellent interviews with James Lipton, who noted the director as being known to do memorable scenes. As far as this whole film is concerned--the scenes aren't memorable, they're haunting. Whether they're funny or scary or tense or dramatic...you'll never forget them. My favorite moments in the movie mostly involved Sandy Dennis. I was enthralled with her entire performance, and as another reviewer noted, there is more going on with her than it seems at first. Notice when she's coming downstairs, and George and Nick are talking about her. She pauses, listening, almost contemplating how she would reappear, then puts on the whole ditzy, "Oh, this house is beautiful!" act, making it appear as if she were as naive as first believed. I also loved her "interpretive dance" at the bar ("I dance like the wind!") and her drunken giddiness is great. Then notice her performance closer to the end, particularly the scene between her and George outside. We know what's going on inside, and we see how George feels about it (though we don't fully understand it), but you have to pay close attention to how Honey reacts, and it's then that you really understand her character.Not to put down any of the other actors. Richard Burton is so amazing, you have to wonder why the heck he didn't win an Academy Award. He gives a brilliant performance, so brilliant it's hard to understand with only one viewing. George Segal's performance is almost entirely composed of reacting to the situation, and it's amazing. His performance should be used as a model for other actors, in playing a very straight, very average guy, thrown into absolute hysteria. While everyone else almost outshines him, he gives a performance so realistic, it's amazing. And then there's Elizabeth Taylor. What a great performance. She portrays and envokes every emotion possible. She's laugh-out-loud funny, in the way that a real person would be funny. I love when she's eating the chicken wing, asking George about the Bette Davis movie. And later, when she follows Nick as he answers the door, and starts singing and dancing towards him. It's sheer madness. But besides being funny, she's frightening, intimidating, powerful, weak, hopeless, intelligent, and perhaps one of the great characters ever portrayed in film.I think the women in this movie really carry the film. Segal and Burton are terrific, but for example, their scene together outside was sort of flat, while the eccentricities of their wives seem to always keep the film alive and exciting. I wish Honey didn't have to vomit so much, she seems to disappear at moments in the movie that need her.Overall, the movie is about four people getting wickedly drunk and going mad together, and it's insane and crazy and a lot of fun. Of course, it's so much deeper than that, and by the end of the movie, you're not only afraid to ever drink again, you're tired and shaking you head, wondering what the hell just happened. Then, it will haunt you, and over the next few days, you'll keep thinking about the movie, and you'll need to see it again, to understand the issues about George and Martha's son, as well as Nick and Honey's issues with having a child. I'm still a little confused, so I may try watching the ending again, to see if I missed anything.Mike Nichols is one of the greatest directors, up there with Hitchcock, in my opinion, and this is one of the best movies ever made. I sincerely recommend you "experience" this film (because it's not just about seeing it, it's about living through it) and perhaps going through the ordeal more than once. This is an example of film making, at it's finest and most timeless, and some of the best acting ever seen, anywhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film on a late night tv slot back in 1991 and I couldn't believe I had allowed so much of my life to go by without being exposed to this treasure. The mechanics of marriage (of 2 marriages, in fact) are dissected mercilessly, but not without a tang of bitter and dark humour. The transition from stage to screen seems well achieved, and not being an Elizabeth Taylor devout fan, I have to say she is superlatively good in this one. The score helps. The stunning black&amp;white photography perfectly suits the intricate moods. Edward Albee must have been proud. I'm sure Mike Nichols was. Sandy Dennis and George Segall are more than up to the challenge, and I for one think all 4 players thoroughly deserved the Academy Award. Still, 2 out of 4 ain't bad - and all in all the film got 5 oscars, so... Go see it!</fullReview>

I've seen just about all her films a million times and she blew me away with her electrifying and sexually charged performances in all of them. But, nothing could prepare me for this. I had to watch the film a second time and found myself fast forwarding the tape to the scenes with her in it. She really did deserve winning the oscar. That scene where Martha and George are in the parking lot and she screams:"You, can handle it, you married me for it", stuck in my mind for days and showcased how in your face and raw this film can be. The film is of course full of priceless one-liners such as "What a dump", "You make me puke" and of course "If you existed, I'd divorce you". Richard Burton, Sandy Dennis and George Segal are also very good. I highly recommend this film for any real movie lover. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are only a few movies one get to see where a 10 out of 10 is really warranted after you've seen the film several times. It's easy to jump to conclusions shouting "This is the best I've ever seen" just after seeing one particular film. This one, however, is my fave movie, and I've seen a lot of both contemporary and old movies. Countless viewings after my initial, I still stand tall and proclaim this to be the best drama ever made.Martha's and George's relationship is that of a long married couple who have grown weary of each other. Yet they cannot leave each other, it's the only life they know. It's the only reality they've set for themselves and they dare not get out. The fights and arguments are, at the end of the day, worth the trouble of keeping your identity, your everyday life, your grasp of reality.The cast, all four of them, are meticulous in their performances. They complete each others presence, nurture the rivalry, fill the gaps and most importantly-delivers to the maximum of their potential.Watching this is more like seeing it performed on stage than in a theatre or on your TV in your home. Early on, you get the feeling all is not well between George &amp; Martha, and as the guests arrive, the story is just aboutto begin. The presence of the characters adds to the overall authenticicty of the story and the parts they play. It's a clichee, but I know many plays of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" has been set up: none can match the original.If Citizen Kane is regarded as the best story ever told on the screen, this has to run very, very close.In a heart-beat, I will give this 10 out of 10. That is saying A LOT, because I am a ferociously discriminating b***ard when it comes to movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Nichols' Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is one of the best stage productions put onto film that I have seen in a long time with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton at the peaks of their careers, playing an alcoholic middle aged couple who argue the whole time while they have young guests who are ironically husband and wife as well. Not only it is one of the best films that I have seen based on plays, but it is also one of the absolute best directorial debuts I have seen. Nichols has redefined dramatic acting with this landmark of a film that deserved all of the academy awards it won and even more awards including best actor for Richard Burton's wonderful work, as well as giving the best performance throughout the entire movie. This is a very good movie but some people will disagree with me as to thinking it is great but not for me.

		<shortDescription>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf focuses on the harsh relationship that a middle aged couple face.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf staring Elizabeth Taylor as Martha, Richard Burton as George, George Segal as Nick, and Sandy Dennis as Honey is a black and white drama from 1966 located on a small New England college campus and focuses on the violate relationship of a middle aged married couple.George is a history professor on a small New England college. George is married to Martha. Martha's father happens to be the president of the college. After leaving a gathering that Martha's father held, an already intoxicated Martha announced to George that she invited a young couple over to their home for cocktails. When Nick and Honey knock on the door, Martha and George are arguing. Its two o'clock in the morning and it is obvious that Nick and Honey feel uncomfortable being there. Nick is the new biology professor at the college. Martha and George continue to argue and are verbally abusive to each other. Martha gives Honey a tour of the house. George warns Martha not to bring up one thing while giving the tour of the house to Honey. When Honey returns, she mentions that Martha told her about their son and that tomorrow would is his birthday. Honey asks where their son his she would like to meet him. They constantly top off all their drinking glasses with alcohol, drinking, fueling more anger, foul language and bitterness. Honey becomes intoxicated runs to the bathroom to be sick. Martha flirts with Nick. Eventually Nick and Honey who look like they have a wholesome marriage start to unravel and all of their skeletons start to come out as well.The set design of this film was mysterious and dark. Martha and George's house was disorganized, bottles of alcohol everywhere, glasses and ashtrays strewn about the house. Martha was making a joke of her own surroundings by quoting a scene from a movie 'what a dump" but she could not recall the name of the movie. The set design was in the middle of the night when the campus was dark and quiet. The use of low lighting in the house and medium close up shots added to the dramatic awareness.I find that Martha, George, Nick and Honey are all dynamic characters in this film. They are all the developing characters that are deeply affected by what happens throughout the film. Martha and George's dysfunctional marriage and mind games that they play with each other start to shift over to affect the marriage of Nick and Honey. Nick and Honey start to talk about their own inadequacies in their marriage. Honey continues to drink more and passes out in the back of the car. Martha tries to seduce Nick. After viewing Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, I really enjoyed it. If you are looking for something different, I recommend that you give this black and film a chance. This film had my attention from start to finish. It is mysterious and dramatic and will have you on the edge of your seat trying to play detective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time the famous couple, married twice, worked together was of the course the big budget epic Cleopatra, and this was their second time on screen together, the first film from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Mike Nichols (The Graduate, Working Girl, Closer, Charlie Wilson's War). Basically the relationship between middle aged married couple Martha (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Dame Elizabeth Taylor) and George (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Richard Burton) is charged and defined by excessive alcohol consumption and a tirade of verbal abuse on each other. George works in a New Carthage university as an associate History professor, and the President there is Martha's father, the relationship has an extra dimension added because of this, but even with their unashamed hatred for each other there is perhaps some dependence for one another. New and ambitious young university Biology professor Nick (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated George Segal) and his mousy wife Honey (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Sandy Dennis) have been invited by Martha for a night of drinking and festivities, and of course as the night goes on the couple are caught between the mind games trying to hurt each other and those around them. The biggest arguments between them comes from the mention of the unseen son they have, who celebrates his sixteenth birthday the following day, they get out of the room a little, but even then the antagonistic behaviour and profanities continue. In the end Nick and Honey leave quietly as the next day begins, it had been revealed that their son has been dead for some time, and left alone Martha and George speak quietly, in some form of reconciliation, and to the chanted question "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf" (to the tune of "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf"), Martha answers "I am, George, I am." Taylor did deserve her Oscar for being constantly spiteful and vindictive towards her husband trying to make a career and not wanting to bring up bad memories, but he is equally compelling doing his best to counteract her emotional attacks and be just as nasty about her drinking problem and embarrassing herself, they were married in real life at the time which makes it all the more believable. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Music for Alex North, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it won BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Dame Elizabeth Taylor was number 77, and Richard Burton number 70 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Taylor was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actresses, Burton was number 29 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Taylor was number 73 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, she was also number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, she was number 13 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and she was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women.

		<fullReview>A unique and disturbing Movie that is a scathing and brutal battle of wits with George and Martha (Liz and Dick) in the eye (and ear) of the hurricane. Caught in this whirlwind of wags are a somewhat normal couple played by (George Segal and Sandy Dennis).This was a taboo breaking, tumultuous Film from the Play, directed by first timer Mike Nichols. It is an assault on the senses and the timid sensibilities from some who may have good manners and civil, or at least domestic, expectations of Host and Guest protocols. At least those that still existed in the mid 1960's.The film is fueled by uninhibited inebriation and sadistic/masochistic characters. There is a perverted charm to it all and while it could be labeled dated, it certainly is an undeniable "attraction" to this mesmerizing crack-up. The Direction is unobtrusive and the performances are great. For those with an interest in abnormal psychology, marital strife, or are simply drawn to soap opera settings with a first-class formation of gutter intelligentsia, this may be riveting entertainment. For others it is a bloviating, braying, belittling, discomfiture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf manages to intrigue and shock with it's tone and incredible examination of truly vile behavior. As the film goes on you get the sense that there's something more beneath the surface, and truly while it never makes anything obvious by the end you do realize what is really going on. My thoughts on it are still scrambling around in my head. All I can say is, I have seen some truly hateful and despicable behavior in film before, but never this much. The emotions and anger boiling here really become hard to watch as the film goes on, and I rarely call a film hard-to-watch even in the grimmest of subject matters. The ensemble cast leads it, and truly an amazing achievement. Taylor is the driving force behind the anger, and this is the first time I have seen her in anything. Truly amazing performance, but it's also good to note the more quiet, the more steady approach by Richard Burton. In fact, this tends to be more a film about him, as we see it mostly through his eyes and we are sitting front and center with him throughout. George Segal is also fantastic here, his tones wavering from the different actions taking place. Sandy Dennis is good at times, and at other times comes off as really inexperienced and lousy. Honestly, how she won an Oscar is beyond me.Overall, I want to let the film settle more to be able to talk about it's actual content, but as it stands, it's a powerful film on all fronts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scalding Albee Drama Becomes Taylor and Burton's Finest Hour Together On Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A double bill with this film and William Friedkin's THE BOYS IN THE BAND, made four years later, reveals the influence that Albee's play had on BOYS playwright Mart Crowley. Both are brilliant, hard-edged dramas involving secrets, psychological games, too much alcohol, and the mysterious and often explosive nature of human relationships.However, unlike BOYS, which was an ensemble piece with nine characters, VIRGINIA WOOLF provides a showcase for two great stars at the peak of their careers: Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, then married in real life. The primary focus is on George and Martha, an embattled middle-aged couple who drink too much and for whom bickering seems to have become a hobby; they are constantly at each other's throats, but every now and then we see that this is exactly how they want their marriage to play out.Elizabeth Taylor had already done a substantial amount of high quality work in Hollywood: she already had one Oscar, and had gained a reputation as a foremost interpreter of Tennessee Williams. Her stunning beauty never got in the way of her determination to do quality work.Here Taylor, who would pick up her second Oscar for Martha, is all but unrecognizable: a blowzy, middle-aged, slightly overweight woman who dresses a bit slutty and makes drunken advances to their male guest Nick (George Segal, solid and dependable as always), who along with his wife Honey (Sandy Dennis at her mousiest; Dennis would win an Oscar for this film as well) have come over for drinks after some faculty party at the university where George and Nick are professors and Martha's father (talked about but never seen) is the president.This is a strange and unsettling film. In BOYS IN THE BAND four years later, the characters' motives, while not always honorable, are usually clear enough to make educated guesses. VIRGINIA WOOLF, on the other hand, raises more questions with each revelation, and at the end, while everything is known, we are not given all the reasons, and a good deal is left to our imaginations.This is as it should be, I think. To reveal too much would spoil the effect that Albee was going for.Taylor is sensational in the greatest role she would ever play, and teaming her with Burton was a master stroke of casting. Burton should have won the Oscar for his work here as well; with all due respect to Paul Scofield, his role in A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS was rather bland by comparison.George Segal, also Oscar nominated, is perfect as Nick; the role is not an especially demanding one but his portrait of a slightly sleazy and opportunistic "nice guy" on the make who is not above sleeping with the daughter of the college president to advance his career is disturbingly real. And Sandy Dennis as Honey is amazing: she puts on an outward façade of ditsy blonde, but as the drinks get consumed and the layers get peeled we discover that there is both more and less to her than we think the first time we see her.This is not always a peasant experience, but in between the ugly moments there's a lot of comedy, and like BOYS four years later, the whole thing, even at its ugliest, is akin to passing an accident on the highway: you may wish you could look away, but you can't. Not even for a million dollars.Stunning directorial debut for Mike Nichols, who would go on to give us such iconic films as THE GRADUATE, CARNAL KNOWLEDGE, SILKWOOD, and THE BIRDCAGE.All in all, a film that every serious film buff must see at least once. And it rewards multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martha &amp; George(Elizabeth Taylbor &amp; Richard Burton ) respectively deliver lifetime performances of an academically married couple, who play cruel mind games on each other . They have invited a faculty couple Honey &amp; Nick (Sandy Dennis &amp; George Segal)over for an informal social meeting where the games begin. This material is so powerful and destructive, I would recommend viewing by only 18 years and older. The power of thought and repressed social problems are the main thread holding this complex dynamic together. Mike Nichols Director , is in complete command and directs with total authority, as he unwraps the layers of emotions that bind the two main combatants. Extremely profound and current. Ernest Lehmman writes a fantastic and mesmerizing screenplay. Watch carefully from a distance, you don't want to get too involved with these two, you might see a reflection you may not like. 10 stars out of 10. Very powerful film. You have been notified.

		<fullReview>This is a study of people and they're repressed emotions, that they aren't aware of? Or simply can not deal with. some don't like the verbal abuse throughout, but it's a movie and movies can't all be rape/murder and guns, unless of course you and your tiny mind can't appreciate anything that would make one think, and try to find the underlying hurt, love, regret in the wickedness. It was and is and should always be one of the best written, directed, acted, edited, lighted movies ever to come out of Hollywood. Elizabeth Taylor very much deserved the Oscar and all the other praise she received. So many great scenes! I love the way she put her cigarette out on whatever floor she happened to be standing on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Night of Games</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is of rejection. Of because it itself rejects typical movie concepts. Its plot is not given to you and it rejects typical movie narration as if it's coming from the characters themselves. As if "they" are discovering it. In fact the films basic action does not become clear until the end in which the truth is the basic action. The film has to be watched twice in order to fully understand its meaning and clear up any confusion the plot may generate. The characters and acting itself is superb as it revolves around the four characters Martha, George, Nick, and Honey.As the audience you may find Martha to be upsetting. Her deviance and lack of tact get the better of you at times. You find that Martha (played by the late Ms. Taylor) is doing such a swell job of annoying her husband that you get annoyed with her character. This is precisely what makes Taylor's acting so rich. You believe her discontent in her life. You pity George for having to face her unending insults. You feel uncomfortable at her blatant infidelity. Finally you believe her so much that you trust her wide range of characterization and deep emotional acting.George as a character evokes sympathy, riddled with ennui. Crippled by his inability to please his soul mate he is fed up with Martha's games?and the audience gets the privilege of watching him fight back. Brought to life by Richard Burton, George is a stalwart within the film, always keeping the narrative going, and the audience waiting.Sharing the name with the deuteragonist of the film, George Segal plays Nick, an ambitious scholar climbing the social ladder with his sights on a reciprocating Martha. Nick and Martha's dalliance cause a good deal of tension in the film. He reacts to the destruction Martha and George create with horror.Honey played by Sandy Dennis is Nick's wife. She pretends not to notice the actions of Martha and her husband. Her interactions with the tumultuous couple reveal secrets and problems within her own marriage.Packed with snarky banter this film is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Where we put the euphemism"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Screen adaptations of stage plays have always had a rather unique character. Cinema is typically a visual medium, and story is conveyed as much through images and actions as anything else. Theatre on the other hand is a verbal medium, composed almost entirely of spoken words which must be convey all manner of other things. And yet this does not make them incompatible. Both can be recall the natural and familiar ? just as real life is full of long wordless moments, so is reality filled with intense periods of continuous verbal interaction, as in the party-of-sorts depicted in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? And both can be entertaining ? just as action and powerful imagery can engage us, so too can emotive language and clever wordplay.The original Edward Albee play was an acclaimed yet controversial success thanks to its profanity and fairly blunt sexual references, and its transfer to the screen (a more conservative medium) was no less fraught. However what really makes it stand out to me as modern and edgy for its time is its frank depiction of the private lives of educated folks. We never see the academy function that the characters have just departed, but we can imagine its tense decorum. The play shows us what such characters do and say in more liberated (not to mention booze-sodden) circumstances, and it is very true to life; a married couple grown overly familiar with the years, playing with words to get at each other, disguising their true affection under layers of overt contempt. The dialogue masterfully trots the line between raw realism and bizarre wit. These are all perfect building blocks for the poignant conclusion.For this cinematic adaptation we have a real masterstroke in casting, with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor playing the two leads. The original choices were James Mason and Bette Davis, who would no doubt have been very good, but they were the obvious choices, safe and predictable. There is something unique and exciting about Burton and Taylor, aged-up and sexed-down to play cynical, middle-aged versions of themselves (that may not have been too far from reality). Both give absolutely monumental performances. Taylor, unrecognisably frumpy, completely surrenders her dignity to go through the gamut of emotions. The bit where she rhythmically taunts Burton about his novel is mesmerising. Burton shows a casual dryness as he delivers such witty lines as "you'll need it as you get older". He is also disturbingly unpredictable. When he goes to get the shotgun, we can absolutely believe he is going to commit murder (and what actually happens is so typical of the play's charming weirdness). Above all, Taylor and Burton have a fantastic rapport, especially in the final scene. Anyone would think they were married? ;) This was the debut picture of director Mike Nichols. This young sprout has a lot in common with a veteran director of the classic era, William Wyler, in that he takes extra special care in showing only who and what we need at any given time, even if results in some pretty odd-looking violations of cinematic grammar. To give you an example, there's a moment about fifteen minutes in where Burton and George Segal are discussing a painting. They are held in a long, static take, and instead of cutting to Taylor we hear her commenting and cackling offscreen. This stillness preserves the awkward intensity of the moment. When it's over we do then cut to a very effective head-on shot of Taylor. Every angle, every cut, and conversely every period without a cut, is there for a reason. Nichols is a child of his time and he is somewhat more stylised than his forebear Wyler, with some giddy close-ups and punchy zooms, but this never quite amounts to the showing off seen in the work of many youngsters of that era. In the previous year Wyler had received his last ever Best Director Oscar nomination, and for this picture Nichols received his first. It's nice to see that the techniques were being passed on from one generation to the next.The trouble often is with stage-to-screen adaptations that, with all that wordiness, they seem to move slowly and awkwardly. This is true for a lot of examples both ancient and modern. But Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is incredibly fast-moving, thanks to the snap and wit of the source material, the canny direction (honourable mention to the superb Haskell Wexler cinematography) and some powerful acting. This is theatre-as-cinema at its most dazzlingly effective. An evening of fun and games indeed?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"And that's how you play 'Get the Guests'!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A first time viewing of this picture virtually demands another. When a line like "You make me puke" delivered by Elizabeth Taylor's Martha turns out to be one of the milder exchanges between herself and husband George (real life husband Richard Burton), you know you've got to be in the middle of one of the premier dysfunctional screen marriages of all time. Not to be outdone by the real one of course, but that's another story for the Hollywood tabloids.I've always given credit to "The Maltese Falcon" for containing the wittiest one-liners in all of filmdom, but the dialog offered here by playwright Edward Albee and screenwriter Ernest Lehman have to top the charts as the most savage. When George and Martha are slinging their arrows of misfortune, even the viewer has to duck for cover. The only way I figured that George wasn't really going to shoot his wife was that the story at that point was only about twenty minutes in, so what were they going to do to fill the rest of the two plus hours.You know what had me doing a quick rewind? In the early scene when Nick (George Segal) sits down next to Martha in the living room, and the older couple continue to fire their missiles at each other, Martha tosses George the bird. She deftly places her forefinger next to the middle finger, but it's definitely the gesture we've come to understand for it's notoriously universal meaning. Go back and check it out.There's no question the principals are at the top of their game here. Even Sandy Dennis, who one can dismiss as a lightweight among the players, is actually walking a fine line between sanity and depravity herself once the basis for her character's marriage to Nick is confronted in another round of the George and Martha parlor game. However I did get squeamish over her repeated rendition of "I dance like the wind" at the roadhouse saloon. You think she might have really been looped for that performance?After initially missing out on the American Film Institute's Top One Hundred Film List in 1997, the picture managed to make it on the second round a decade later. I think that was a worthy correction, certainly validated by it's thirteen Oscar nominations, and wins for Taylor and Dennis in their respective categories. As for a recommendation, this is a tough must see, especially for couples on the brink, as it might provide more ammunition than entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get yourself embarked on an epic, destructive, chaotic ... but so vulnerably human, sleepless night ...on the rocks...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as perfection is concerned, Mike Nichols' adaptation of Edgar Albee's sulfurous and successful play with the enigmatic title "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" is one of these movies that strikes you with their absolute flawlessness. Yes indeed, every single element had to be at the top of the game to come up with such a thrilling psychological masterpiece at the end. "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" is a movie I wouldn't hesitate to use the epithetic 'perfect' to describe it, and with reasons.Let's start with the writing which explains why the movie is regarded as a milestone. The script flirts for the first time with profanity and, as said Jack Valenti, the late President of the MPAA and creator of the current rating system, "Virginia Woolf"'s screenplay is like the burnt arrow that set a giant fire in the remains of the Hayes Code. There would be a before and after. Sure, we could be surprised by the degree of shock that the script inspired, which such benign words as "Goddam you" "Bull" "The hell with" and many stuff I can write without fearing a censorship, but when you put them in the context of the film, it's revolutionary, and makes the interactions even more modern, realistic and authentic. On that department, the movie is full of one-liners giving a unique flavor to the eternal conflict relationship between George and Martha, which makes the perfect transition for the second aspect of the film's genius : the acting.Some say that the actors draw their inspiration in their past experience to find the right tone. Call it method acting or not, we can't be sure if this is true, and even if it was, it's not a guarantee for success. But for some reason, we're inclined to believe that in the case of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, a then married couple, it had to play a significant part in their portrayal of George and Martha. There is a strange complicity hidden in the animosity they display to each other, and vice versa, one would wonder why such a dysfunctional couple would stay together, but this is a mystery hidden in the heart of George and Martha, and only their behavior, their words, their teasing games trust our intelligence with subtle hints. As viewers, we're actually put in the same shoes as the two supporting characters, George Segal as Nick and Sandy Dennis as Honey. Nick and Honey will endure the collateral damages of the destructively epic night George and Martha will embark them on, a night that would ultimately reveal the misleading aspect of the young couple's apparent normality, a night full of shouts, noises, screams, laughs, games, deceptions, frustration on the rocks. "Never mix, never worry", they said. God knows how they will have to mix, and how sure they will have to worry.The display of feelings and emotions is breath-taking; every actor plays his and her part perfectly. Richard Burton is like the ringmaster of a burlesque tragicomedy, his delivery of lines in a Shakespearian realism is a delight, so is his apparent serenity contrasting with Martha's temper, and bestial noises. Martha, oh Martha, she's the heart of the film, she's the soul, she carries the whole movie with her presence. If one proof of Elizabeth Taylor's tremendous talent was needed, it'd be "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?". She gained almost 40 pounds, she deliberately made herself ugly when she was at the culmination of her beauty, one would hardly believe she was only 34 in this film, but this is what acting is about : dedication. And the range of emotions she showed was so wide it probably covers most of the acting displayed in others actresses' whole career. George Segal shines as the 'straight man' of the film, and manages to steal some scenes,which is quite impressive, considering his co-stars, but it's nothing like Sandy Dennis, the mousy wife, who made the portrayal of drunkenness so tragically hilarious, and right on, in its over the top note. Four great performances, four deserved Oscar nominations, and a shocking snub for Burton.It's hard to believe this was his first film, but Mike Nichols' direction is the key element as what got the best out of the actors, and the writing. You can adapt a play, but transcending it is another matter. Nichols created a sensation of chaos and tension through simple tricks handled at the right time, and the right moment. Take one moment, where Honey will mention the 'famous secret', we'll get the first close-up of George's spinning his head, and says 'What?', this is the first tense moment of the film, as the first mention of the enigma that would drive the whole narrative. It's an adaptation of a stage, but contrarily to a play, and to all the movies made before, people talk in the same time, and we manage to hear quite everything. This works because this is true to life, people talk in the same time, creating an even more uncomfortable feeling, noises and unexpected burst of violence, shouts and cries: at one point, George pushes Martha on a car so violently you can feel the impact. Mike Nichol's flawless direction is almost surpassed by the beautiful black and white cinematography that couldn't have made the night look more poetically sad and melancholic, with a smooth game of lights and shadows creating a haunting feeling embodied by the melancholic music of the film.But "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" is more than a combination of elements, you still have to discover the poignant story of a couple with false illusions that reveal something deeper in their relationships, than the ugliness of their reality. So come to discover, to watch or re-watch one of the greatest American films ... if you're not afraid of Virginia Woolf ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elizabeth Taylor Was A Great Actress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bette Davis who coveted the role of Martha said she went into "shock" when Bette heard that Jack Warner and Mike Nichols cast Elizabeth Taylor then the Queen of the Movies, gorgeous and sexy and in her mid 30's, literally at the height of her movie fame. I did not go into shock but I was surprised. Patricia Neal, Roz Russell along with Ms. Davis were the often cited choices for the great role of Martha.I might have selected Susan Hayward. In hindsight Warner and Nichols made an inspired choice as Ms. Taylor is nothing short of magnificent dominating the movie from start to finish and justly won the Academy Award for her performance, surely the finest of her career and one of the finest of all time. Bravo Elizabeth!Richard Burton is cast as George, again against type, as Burton in real life was a commanding Man. Before the film was shot James Mason was favored for George. George Segal is fine as the Young Professor, my only criticism and I fear I am alone is Sandy Dennis who was Nominated and won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. This film joins the best of all Warner Bros films: Casablanca, Yankee Doodle Dandly, My Fair Lady, The Life of Emile Zola as one of the top 5 films ever to come out of the Warner Studio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually I have not seen the movie in a long time. This review comes from seeing the play last night at the Kreeger at Arena stage in Washington, DC. I have to say that it was phenomenal. I just remember the movie being a lot of screaming. The play had a lot more sarcastic phrasing than screaming and the lead actor playing George was extraordinary.But what leads me to compose this review is to try to counter the criticisms of this movie about how difficult it is to watch. I have also read some reviews discussing how "Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf" is word play on "Who's afraid of the big bad wolf" and dragging in a "Three little pigs" interpretation. I would humbly suggest that the play/film is a little bit more witty than that.Let's start off by saying that the characters of Nick and Honey are not real. (Again I delve into a Magical Realism interpretation of the "action.")At the beginning of the movie, George and Martha have just returned home from a faculty mixer. It is two o'clock in the morning and apparently, instead of going to bed, they have to entertain a new faculty member and his wife at the behest of Martha's father, the College President. This seems pretty unusual.But lets look at it a different way.Suppose Martha's father had instead asked them to examine their marriage and their life together. Perhaps Nick and Honey are just metaphors for the worst things that they fear in their marriage. Maybe they are themselves soon after their marriage. Martha and George's interaction with Nick and Honey is merely Martha and George confronting their worst fears, or reconciling their earlier expectations of what their life might be like together.Their interactions with Nick and Honey allow then to "discuss" their marriage. This nocturnal engagement between them, this most civilized exchange of ideas about their marriage, is subsequently portrayed with the most raw and vulgar emotional patter one could think of. It is this self engagement, this self denial, this self confrontation that drives the emotional denouement, not the three little pig-pig-piggies.But the moon, ahhh, the moon. When George goes out in the moonlight to pick snapdragons, Martha accuses him of lying - the moon had already set so there could be no moon now. George emphatically denies her logic, reissuing the claim that the moon had come back up. But why so much emotion about such a prosaic astronomical event? Well, aye there she blows, for the moon rising a second time is full well hope of a second chance and a marriage that will last a lifetime.So ponder and re-ponder, for the lives of Nick and Honey exist solely in the willies of our beloved George and Martha. Hey, I remember reading a few books about George and Martha, to my daughter, a few years back. They were hippopotamuses and exceedingly polite ....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf is Directed by Mike Nichols with a screenplay by Ernest Lehman and is based on the play by Edward Albee and stars Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Sandy Dennis and George Segal. The film won five Academy Awards including Best Actress,Best Supporting Actress and Best Photography.Burton was nominated for Best Actor but sadly didn't get the award. Compared to his wife's quite showy performance, his performance is very subtle but no less powerful and gripping.The clever casting decision to have the worlds most famous couple play the leads was a big draw for audiences, the couple give two of the best performances of their respective careers and are unforgettable as George and Martha.George(Richard Burton)is the quiet History Professor of an American College,married to the boozy and loudmouthed Martha(Elizabeth Taylor)the daughter of the College President.The two indulge in draining love/hate mind games and arguments,at first glance it seems to be for mental stimulation(however it later transpires there is much more to it than that.)One night after a College party, Martha invites new teacher Nick(George Segal)and his young wife Honey(Sandy Dennis)over for drinks.As the night wears on Martha and George argue and play a few mind games, the result of which proves emotionally destructive for the younger couple.Emotionally draining and gripping this is like watching a train crash unfold before your eyes.You feel you should stop watching but you can't. The audience is drawn deeper into the intensity of the characters and their games.One of the best adaptations of a stage play ever filmed,Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf is a brilliant film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Civilized savagery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Nichols' directorial debut "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" arrived at a time when Hollywood was still in the grip of the much-maligned production code. The film pushed the envelope with its profanity and sexual implication, thus helping to pave the way for the MPAA ratings system.The story concerns aging couple George &amp; Martha (Richard Burton &amp; Elizabeth Taylor) whose relentless bitterness makes for an eventful night in the company of young couple Nick &amp; Honey (George Segal &amp; Sandy Dennis).While the film's language is pretty tame by today's standards the dialogue still retains its bite. Ernest Lehman's interpretation of Edward Albee's play is rife with cutting remarks, all the more devastating for being fashioned with utmost erudition. The screenplay deservedly received one of the film's thirteen Oscar nominations.However, the script wouldn't have seemed so impressive if it hadn't been placed in such capable hands. It's quite likely that the performances of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor represent the best work of their careers. Taylor won an Oscar for her efforts while Burton had to content himself with a mere nomination. In the supporting roles, George Segal and Sandy Dennis were both Oscar nominated, with the latter taking home the award. With these plaudits, it's fully justifiable to state that every performance in the film is outstanding.Considering that this was Mike Nichols' debut behind the camera I'd say that he turned in an exceptional job, one that was rightly rewarded with an Oscar nomination. Of course, the Oscar-winning cinematography of Haskell Wexler also has a lot to do with the film's visual appeal. Meanwhile, Alex North's moody score, while sparingly used, represents another key contribution.In the end, the film's vitriol may become a bit tiring over the course of 131 minutes but, other than that, it's difficult to find much fault with the film. "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" is a one of a kind film whose edge has been dulled a little by time but not enough to seriously diminish its overall impact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having heard of this film before I was very interested. Not my kind of film but still good.The fights and arguments of this manipulative couple were very real for the time period. It made the movie interesting, and helped to feel as if you really knew them, you were really there. But Martha and George's relationship was sort of weird if you ask me. It kind of made the movie uncomfortable to me. The one thing i must say about this is movie, i was extremely impressed with Elizabeth Taylor's acting chops. It was also very interesting to see Richard Burtono in this role, and younger of course, but Taylor still outshines him in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film made me uncomfortable from the very beginning, with that being said I was completely entertained at the same time. Almost immediately the two main characters, George and Martha are fighting, and by fighting I mean ripping each other apart and embarrassing one another. The dialouge in this film is unbelievable and the rate the the actors spew these insults at one another is quite impressive. Once you think this can't become any more uncomfortable Martha announces that she has invited another couple to join them. The young couple arrives just as Martha is screaming at George and sets the tone for the rest of the evening. What was most interesting to me was how George and Martha's brutal honesty allowed the other two characters to be honest as well, with themselves and others. The secrets about one another seemed to pour out of each character's mouth almost instantaneously. The use of black and white for the film when it could have very easily been made in color, was very interesting and drew me in a bit more, it gave an intimate feel to the film, as if you were in George and Martha's living as well. The whole film captures each character's attempt to destroy one on another and yet it ends with a somewhat sweet and gentle moment between George and Martha. The film is one I would definitely watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was okay. But its not a movie I would watch again. There were a lot of close ups on the characters. This movie has low key lighting. The lighting through out the movie is dark. Martha and George are married and fight all the time. They have a couple over and they all drink. I like the scene at the end the characters show great emotion. Because George tells Martha that hes going to kill their son. In this movie the audience hears the sound of the ice in the glass and the leaves in the background. These noises are non-diegetic.The ending of the movie was good when the camera goes in on the couples hands. So this is a different kind of movie you don't normally see such a small cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Nichols' masterpiece is one of the most emotional depictions of a marriage on the verge of falling to pieces, an astounding, insightful and unremitting film that deserved it 5 Oscars. It was groundbreaking in terms of language and theme (It been released in 1966). It is one of the greatest masterpieces of the 60's and of cinema itself.It's director, Mike Nichols, was at that time directing stage plays and his debut film was this film, which I consider the greatest film ever made by Nichols.Ernest Lehman produced a fantastic screenplay, in my opinion, the best of his career. It keeps much of the dialogue of Edward Albee's play of the same title, which the film is based on. He also produced the film.But the best thing about this film is the acting. Elizabeth Taylor gives the best performance of her career as Martha, a spiteful, cruel charactered women who is married to George (Richard Burtan, again very effective), a history professor. Martha invites Honey (Sandy Dennis) and Nick (George Segal) over for a night of mental games.Nichols' paring of the most famous and tempestuous celebrities ever, Taylor and Burton, is what makes Who's afraid of Virginia Wolff so good. The energy and presence you feel from both of them is fantastic.The supporting cast are excellent also.Over all, this film is a masterpiece thats reflects the time it was been made.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read Edward Albee's play for the first time this year; in itself it is an incredible piece of theatre. However, the film adaptation is wonderful.The director's choice of location and interpretation of the play adds to its magic and grabbing power. Furthermore, Taylor and Burton's performances are astounding. I haven't seen them in anything else, but I must say there performances were 10 out of 10 and the Academy's decision to not award Burton Oscar for Best Male Actor is unacceptable, the whole cast was magnificent.In my humble opinion the key to a good film is acting, if the acting is good then the film is half a success. Lighting, sound, etc only contributes to the overall performance and that is why this is a must see film. Truly fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing that comes to mind for me when commentating on Mike Nichols (The Graduate) film adaptation of Edward Albee's play of the same name was the uniform excellence of the performances he generated from all four leads (the females leads, Taylor and Dennis, won Oscars while the male leads, Burton and Segal, had to 'settle' for just being nominated). To be sure the film is not easy viewing but it is fascinating to watch how loss, frustrated ambition, aging, insecurity, and alcoholism all contribute to the wear and tear of a marriage that has become more or less a perpetual sparring match with only the briefest of truces. The impact of the elder couple's dysfunction on the younger couple is also disturbing. Highly recommended, especially for the terrific acting, 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the ultimate witty drama, evidently adapted from a play. Before I saw this film I didn`t have much regard for elizabeth taylor as an actress, now I admire her... Richard Burton is excellent as always and George Segal was quite a surprise for me, the same as Sandy Dennis. What impresses me most is the economy of elements, the film owes its success mainly to the dialogue, there are only four characters and the setting is very sober, it is obviously not a very expensive film to make.This makes me wonder why does the film industry today spend millions in the production of films which have no interest whatsoever when you can have a masterpiece for much less. The film explores the "dark side" of the soul, the bitterness, frustration and consequent anger bursts out all through the film, which develops in real time (quite a challenge)black humor is specially delicious and enables you to bear the sadness constrained in the story. It makes you think about life in general, absolutely recomended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" is an incredible film. By the end of it, you'll be totally exhausted and emotionally drained, but I've seen it a few times and I think the only way to even begin to understand it is by seeing at least twice. The setting is deceptively simple: a middle-aged couple, George (a history professor) and his wife Martha (who's father is head of the college George teaches at) invite Nick and Honey (a couple in their thirties who have just moved to the area because Nick has got a job teaching Biology at the college) round to their house for a drink after a party. What ensues is completely mind-boggling, as it turns out that George and Martha are locked into a distructive marriage, and the whole night turns into a war between the two. Almost from the word go, George and Martha (played brilliantly by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor) are flinging caustic insults at each other and although their words are shocking and brutal, I actually found some of their exchanges extremely funny. Richard Burton is especially masterful with his sarcastic comebacks to his wife's verbal body blows, and in my opinion he deserved the Oscar he was nominated for, but failed to win. As the film develops you are dragged deeper and deeper into the conflict, just as Nick and Honey are. George Segal as Nick and Sandy Dennis as Honey are excellent support for the mighty Burton and Taylor, who eventually turn on their guests and use them as pawns in their twisted mind-games. The end scene is where the 'truth' (if it is indeed the truth - for the viewer is never sure - like George and Martha - what is true and what isn't) comes out, and then the film ends with George and Martha seemingly making peace, with her clutching at his hand, probably because they've knocked every ounce of fight out of each other during the course of the movie. "Truth and illusion, George, you don't know the difference," Martha tells her husband scornfully in one scene, and by the end of the movie, neither did I. The almost constant dialogue is so cleverly woven that you can never tell when George and Martha are being serious or not, and I think the whole point of the film is that the audience never really know the truth. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good drama, and although I admit it is a hard movie to watch simply because of the depths it reaches into, it is also compulsive viewing - I didn't move for the whole two hours the first time I watched it. The acting is superb, and Elizabeth Taylor gives the best performance of her entire career as the loud, embittered and yet somehow tragic character of Martha. This is a movie that definitely stays with you, and one of my many after-thoughts was this: I wonder how much of Burton and Taylor's real relationship came through when they were playing George and Martha. My guess is that their publicised verbal battles had nothing on those of George and Martha, although it certainly makes you wonder!</fullReview>

In some parts this film makes you laugh like when Elizabeth says to Richard "Ar poor Georgie poorgie" in a sarcastic trashy. But comic wise Sandy Dennis is the homouras one as she plays a silly blonde who spends all her time giggling, drinking brandy and vomiting. This film is a knock out. It's worth seeing.

		<shortDescription>Edward Albee: A genius of American drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love this film. Every time I see it, I find something new and interesting. The intricacy of its writing and complex symbolism make it one of the most intriguing dramas ever written. To start, the roles in the movie could not have been cast better. Elizabeth Taylor delivers one of the strongest performances ever captured on screen; she definitely deserved the Oscar she won for it. Richard Burton's portrayal of George is excellent in every way. His performance is almost haunting. The two supporting characters are excellent as well. However, the most amazing thing about Virginia Woolf is the drama itself. Edward Albee explores some of the most fascinating topics with his symbolism in it by questioning the American dream. Through his words, Albee showcases the corruption of the American dream through his four characters, each representing a certain aspect of American society. Beyond the obvious story line, there is so much more to be seen. If it is viewed as a play existing only in the context of George and Martha's life, it is very poignant and wonderful. But if it is viewed as an allegory, a new, amazing dimension is added, bringing so much more meaning to the words being spoken. Albee also explores human emotions and the things that motivate us to take actions. The themes of illusion versus reality, loneliness, corruption, the sanctity of life, and the American dream are made all too real in this fascinating drama. The issue of abortion is even touched upon through Nick's wife. As a master of the absurd and real, Albee creates the best that American drama has to offer. Explore the terrifying world of George and Martha in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf." It is a world not too unfamiliar to us, even if we do not realize it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This adaptation of Edward Albee's play trims around the edges and opens out the action to more than one location, but keeps the acidic heart of the piece intact. With a cast of four firing on all cylinders - Elizabeth Taylor superb as Martha, drunken fantasist and all-round loudmouth; Richard Burton (a great role for him sadly overlooked by the Academy Awards) as her - on the surface - long-suffering husband George; Sandy Dennis (impressive) as the neurotic Honey; and George Segal as Nick, the ambitious new blood professor.Honey and Nick are, of course, Martha and George a lifetime ago, and look what's in store for them. Secrets, lies and true feelings on all sides come spilling out during the night the young couple visit the older couple's place. It isn't all top-note, there are quiet moments, too - the script is superb. This is certainly Burton-Taylor's best collaboration and proves both were great actors in their time.</fullReview>

That Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? remained a 10 in my mind over the course of time impresses me that it's a truly important film which I'll be recommending for years.Performances all around are g*ddam* good. I can't think for the life of me of a film that made the widescreen rounds recently that made me feel the depth of pain that felt by humans resulting from relationships with others.I can't help but imagine that Taylor and Burton were experiencing real-life pain off-screen which was captured on-screen. If this is not the case then this is bar-none the best performance of each of their careers.The directing of the young Mike Nichols is outstanding. My goodness, how he managed to move things along and then bring the action to a halt with one revelation or another. Most significantly is the resolution after the night of hell. I was stunned at his command at this point and wondered if this was simply the prelude to the next night.God help us all so that we don't become Martha and George.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why did it take so long for me to get around to seeing this film? I was remiss in this regard. This film is brilliant - from the acting, to the direction, to the cinemetography, to even the hair &amp; make-up, this film sings a morbid song of moral turpitude &amp; psychological torture that can never be re-created or duplicated (at least not with this script). The performances are stunning - Taylor is ugly both inward &amp; outward, Burton is intellectual &amp; therefore more dangerous, Segal is youthful and strong but more easily used because of it, and Dennis is sweet and naive with a great pain inside her that represents the lost dreams and hopes of all of them. The direction is wonderful, even if the re-setting of half of the film is not true to the original play. In a way, it does add to the manicness of the story when the battle leaves the parlour to go to the lawn or the roadhouse and then returns painfully to the house, but we almost suffer too much when we re-enter that confining space &amp; that is true to the text so I can't kvetch about that. The choice of shooting the backs of heads during some scenes is wonderful &amp; real, giving it a cinema verite quality that I was surprised to see. And the editing is so good that I would almost believe that there were four or five cameras rolling simultaneously, the actors did the whole thing through top to bottom, and the editor had to just switch back &amp; forth as the film went on. This speaks to the actors' talents, but the editor can make it jerky &amp; disjointed so that you notice his work - it takes a master to hide his talent. The entire production team was making the same movie every step of the way. You owe it to yourself to see this, if only to learn how a drama can be done to great success. A good story (albeit sad) well told (even though it may leave you feeling tired).</fullReview>

But for sheer power, this movie has few peers. It is not pretty. There is no happy ending. And I hope that no one's life is like this. But watching George and Martha bait, feint, claw, batter and tear into each other and make each other(emotionally) bleed is like watching two intellectual and powerful cats at the peak of their power. There is more violence here then in any "action" flick but it is violence done with wit: civilized but far more deadly. The entire cast is brilliant but special note must be made of Richard Burton. Forget his well-publicized bombs. Watch this and "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold" and it would be hard not to count him among the greatest of all actors. Yes, it they are no more (and no less) than "Vicious children with their oh-so-sad games, hopscotching their way through life", no one has ever done it with more adroit skill. "Truth and illusion, George; Don't you know the difference" "No, but we must carry on as though we did." is the axiom for our times.</fullReview>

Tense and sad, this movie goes through a series of emotional crescendos until the ending, when the truth becomes clear, and you heart breaks. This is a movie where the dialogue becomes the key factor, and Ernest Lehman's script basically leaves Edward Albee's play intact. The movie will drain you as it goes on, and by the end, you are tired. But relieved, as the protaganists can move on with their lives after living in a fantasy for years.

		<fullReview>All four main actors in this film are impressive. It's fun to watch them just go at it. For the most part, it's the performances of the two females (Liz Taylor and Sandy Dennis) that really shine in this film. They give phenomenal performances. Those are two of the greatest female performances ever. It's shocking to see Liz Taylor (who herself is a visual wonder) in this film as an out-of-control alcoholic wreck. Sandy Dennis steals the show as George Segal's seemingly sweet wife who has one drink too many. As far as the movie itself goes...it's a really good movie--clever script, good story. However, when the characters are not arguing which each other out of a drunken rage, the movie just drags on. I was really bored by the scene where Burton and Segal go outside to talk. I was annoyed by the black-and-white used for this film, although the cinematography is very good (creative use of camera angles, especially the closeups). Nevertheless, the movie has many funny and unpredictable scenes. I really liked Taylor's spoof of Bette Davis at the beginning of the movie. This film is and will remain an unforgettable classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are maybe 3 films that I have ever seen which have branded themselves into my own personal film lexicon. Of those 3 films, "Virginia Woolf" made a crossover at some point. Probably after the second viewing, if I remember correctly. "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Virginia Woolf, Virginia Woolf," George sings to Martha in the films final moments. "I am, George." She pauses. "I am". And that last moment makes for perhaps the most emotionally shattering and reality altering minute in all of cinema. People do hurt themselves, as playwrite Edward Albee knew so well, and they do it all the time. Even to those they "love". This film is not only a landmark in storytelling, but in emotional truth as well. Bravo.</fullReview>

But, I have a problem with this as in many of the films of the 1960s. Many of these are based on plays and the film doesn't give us anything more than a great script and performances. Like "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?" and "To Kill a Mockingbird", we are not watching a movie; we are watching a play that has been filmed, nothing more. I would rather go and see a play on stage with live performances than watch something of this sort on a screen. I expect more from a movie - more scenes and scenery, better visual and sound effects, more active camera work, a captivating score, and so on. Otherwise, why not simply go out to see a play instead?

		<fullReview>I am a high school English teacher and have used WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? on my senior writer's craft course for many years now.This is probably the most brilliantly written play of the 20th century. Edward Albee went to the core of the American soul with this one, laying bare all life's traps and traumas dressed up in social issues. There are four characters in the play. George and Martha are the central characters. George is a professor at a New England college whose president is his father-in-law. His wife, Martha, married George, to enhance further her own social status, but fell far short of this because George was content to be "in" the History department, rather than "run" the History department. This unhappy union produced a peculiar fantasy centered around their "child" in relation to which they play a particular game. There is one rule to this game: no one must know about it. Martha, in a drunken moment, slips, and reveals it to her guest, Honey, the wife of Nick, a new, young "good looking" professor who, as Martha would have it, is "in the Math department or something". A vicious, soul-cleansing game ensues for all. The fantasy lies in tatters at the end-or does it? This play was turned into a superb film in 1966, starring Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Sandy Dennis, and George Segal. It received 13 Academy Award nominations, and won six of them, including a richly deserved Best Actress Oscar for Elizabeth. If you've never seen this one, make sure that you wrap your body in a thick layer of padded velvet. The film is in black and white, and your whole being will be too, by the end of it! Superb!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie will leave you feeling drained but glad you're not Martha &amp; George ( or Nick &amp; Honey for that matter). The dialog is the starring role but all 4 performances are wonderful, Burton &amp; Taylor being spectacular. What I like about this movie are the contradictions- they fight, say very mean things to each other (Martha &amp; George) but yet love each other in a way that only comes when you've loved someone long enough to know the worst thing about them. Another movie with similar witty &amp; stinging dialog and emotion is The Lion in Winter. Both Henry (II) and Elanor fight and plot &amp; and say hurtful things, but you can see the depth of their love. Both movies are 5 stars on a scale of 4!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense, Funny Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this is an all-around good movie, two things really stand out in my mind. The first is Haskell Wexler's cinematography, which makes the camera seem like a fifth, silent character in the film, giving the audience the impression of "sitting in" on this cramped, hellish cocktail party. The second is the dialogue. Most of us have had the misfortune of knowing a couple like this (a few have maybe even been IN a couple like this), but the dialogue in this movie makes these characters come alive. While this is definitely a very funny, very sad film, the highest praise I can pay it is that it is in some moments difficult to watch, as it is almost TOO tense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The greatest alcoholic movie ever filmed, is more influenced by booze than a lesson on the perils of drinking. Should be a warning more on who NOT to marry. Or more aptly, who NOT to invite to the house at 2 in the morning. Many people like to discuss what film has the best dialogue of all time, but this classic should be considered a top 3 contender. You could quote the entire screenplay. Liz deserved her Oscar and it's a shame Burton didn't get to share one with her. It would have been the nicest husband and wife moment in Academy history. Even more astute and entertaining when you watch loaded yourself, don't take a copy over to anyone planning on walking down the aisle soon. You'll shatter their illusions after 10 minutes. Not only a dark comedy,it's also an honest look at the underbelly of social climbing and game playing that rule many of our finest college campuses. I'm sure there's Marthas and Georges at every small university in the country, if not as extreme, then pretty darn close. The acting here is at the highest level and will make you yearn for lots of re-fills, so keep plenty of ice cubes on hand in the freezer... Beats every other Drunk Movie out there by a mile</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Play, great actors, average adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mix appears perfect, Albee's play charting the fall of Western values and the myth of the American Dream epitomised through a foul mouthed couple and imaginary son, with its principle characters to be played by Burton and Taylor, a couple whose own marriage was fast deteriorating. Indeed it does result in extraordinary performances from both Taylor, who switches perfectly from dominating, tormenting and fierce, to frightened and fragile, and Burton who seems to bring his own frustrated ambitions into the role resulting in a superb performance.However all the other things I loved about the play were lacking from the film. The play is set in the one room of the house which makes it very claustrophobic, as an audience you simply cannot escape the tension that builds to increasing climaxes every act. The script is a monster which also means this tension is stretched until it is almost unbearable, but also enthralling. By moving away from just the one room the film becomes less intense, and rather than adding variety, the extra scenes in the car and at the bar seem pointless and tacked on, rather than giving the audience a break the film merely loses the audiences focus which remains intense in the play.Naturally the film had to cut the script in order to make it palatal, however by doing so it lost a key element of the play. I remember seeing the play just after 9/11 and seeing the effect the words along the lines of "and dogged by crippling alliances the West inevitably must fall". This whole idea of the West hindered by tradition (History, George) falling behind the waves of the future in the East (Nick) fascinated me. However this wasn't brought out by the film, and many of the key exchanges between Nick and George such as the discussions about genetics were omitted.Nevertheless it is still fantastic to watch these two great actors battling it out in two larger than life roles, in a play that brings out the tensions of their real life marriage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a movie from this play some years ago and now i just saw this one and after i just took the book to read the play because some dialog was surely missing. The play is great. Now let's talk about the movie:In 1966, Mike Nichols directed his first film with a screenplay adapted by Ernest Lehman from a controversial play, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as Martha and George. Sandy Dennis played Honey, and George Segal played Nick. All of the film's actors were nominated for Academy Awards. Elizabeth Taylor won the Oscar for Best Actress and Sandy Dennis won for Best Supporting Actress. The film also won for Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Costume Design. It was nominated for Best Actor, Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Picture, Best Sound, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay. Mike Nichols didn't win the Oscar but he did with his next movie, The Graduate.The movie had a resounding success and I think this is all the play's merit.Lehman relocated some scenes, he also added some lines,and cut some of the dialog. This is the major mistake of the movie and it upset Albee. The play was an enormous commercial success. Many audience members and critics named it as revolutionary and as marking a new era in American drama. But many found its language, strong sexual content, interest in "taboo" subjects and criticism of the American dream as shocking and was the "reason" why the did not receive the Pulitzer award although it was voted for it.I'm not gonna say a single word about the movie action and i advise you to read the book or to see the play because you miss very much of it's symbols and meanings, especially the political ones ("I will not give up Berlin!")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First a confession. I've seen this movie three times over the past 20 years. On the third viewing, and after watching `The Hours' (about the real Virginia Wolfe), I finally got it. This story came to the screen decades ahead of its time ? dealing with subject matter deemed best suited for closets and sweeping under the cellar stairs (by society) for decades. I.e., Bipolar disorder and depression. The film brings both diseases into sharp focus, leaving the audience with the considerable task of understanding why / how. I cannot imagine anyone understanding the depths of the relationship Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton portray on stage. It unfolds neatly in the last five minutes; however, until then, they seem to be a pain-in-the-butt, ready-for-divorce, disenchanted couple that bicker with and prod each other to the brink. If you've seen it, watch it again (and this is perennial advice). It's worth the time. It is film making at its level best. My third third viewing elevated its ranking to my top 5 favorites of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A blistering combination of black comedy and drama is quintessential Taylor-Burton.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably the best on-screen collaboration between real-life couple (at the time) Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, "WAOVW" is an acting tour-de-force which still manages to leave an indelible impression on audiences nearly 44 years later. Taylor reaches the zenith of her career as Martha, a 50-ish, slovenly, overweight, foul-mouthed alcoholic shrew married to withdrawn, repressed, reticent and languid history professor George (incomparably portrayed by Burton). One late night, after a faculty get-together at the college (where Martha's father happens to be the dean), Martha invites newly appointed biology professor Nick and his wife Honey (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) over to their house for a few drinks. Little do the naive young couple know that they are about to fall prey to the ensnaring and belittling tactics of their hosts. Martha regards George as being nothing more than a gutless failure, while George accuses her of being too flirtatious, indecent and disgusting. Each couple has secrets that they hope to shield the other one from knowing. Since Martha could never conceive, her and George fabricated a "child" of their own, with blond hair and green eyes, to serve as an entity of hope and happiness in their fading marriage. Nick married Honey because he impregnated her and because her father, a con man who posed as a preacher, left her a generous sum of money. The winsome, child-like Honey, ever fearful of being hurt, aborted the child and carries a facade of young effervescent vitality, which actually masks the deeply repressed angst (illustrated by Dennis' interpretive "dance" at the roadside bar) inside of her. No one scene in this movie tops the other one. The way the characters play on each other's strengths and weaknesses, IS what great acting is all about, immaculately performed here by the four-person cast. Out of its 13 nominations, 5 well-deserved Oscars went to Taylor, Dennis, Art Director Richard Sylbert, Costume Designer Irene Sharaff, and Cinematographer Haskell Wexler. Five other awards that the film truly merited but missed were Best Picture, Best Actor (Burton), Dramatic Score (Alex North), Editing (Sam O'Steen) and Best Director (Debuting Mike Nichols, who would win for his next film, "The Graduate"). A classic bombshell of a film that broke through all the Hollywood taboos of its day and emerged as a triumphant bouquet of unforgettable acting. **** of ****.fliratflirtatious and</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies cause controversy. You can't stop it. Somewhere, a group of people who think alike will dislike your movie and call it filth. It's unavoidable. It's rare that a controversial movie starts a whole new movement, or even changes history forever. And yet, it has happened. The sixties were a tumultuous time for cinema, because people were speaking out. It treated us to more mature storylines, more `naughty' stuff we weren't allowed to see in the 50's, and more importantly, it gave us a bunch of great, ground-breaking movies, like Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?George (Richard Burton) is a college history professor, married to the dean's daughter, Martha (Elizabeth Taylor). From the minute we meet this couple, they are fighting. They fight hard. After coming home from one of those boring social parties, Martha tells George that she invited a young couple over for drinks and conversation, much to George's exasperation. The couple arrives later in the night. Nick and Honey (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) are the new couple in the university. In a night full of booze and screams, the truths will go a-flying out.I have never seen a movie that mistreats its characters so badly. Mind you, it's a good thing. The characters have no pity for each other, and we find ourselves having no pity for them either. Elizabeth Taylor's brutish Martha has no real qualities. Her life revolves around breaking down her exasperated, mild husband. Her marriage is failed and she puts the blame squarely on him, on his inability to succeed. George, on the other hand, knows that she's the only reason their marriage fails but he cannot do anything. For better and for worse, he's attracted to this woman and she's his wife. Nick is na?ve and believes that his `elders' are better than him. Throughout the movie, he changes and even has a little hanky-panky with Martha. Sandy Dennis as Honey is really the only character that we can feel any sympathy for, because she is stuck in this tornado, drunk off her rocker. She can't help what happens, and we do feel for her until the end of the film when we realize that she isn't better than any of the others. The characters have a distinct flavor to each other, and I can't help but notice the resemblance between this film and Elia Kazan's 1951 masterpiece, A Streetcar Named Desire. The performances are surely the best part of this film. Elizabeth Taylor's firey performance won her an Oscar, deservedly because this is her best, most mature and most unconventional performance. She gained 20 pounds and at only 34 years old, she already looked like 45. Richard Burton, Taylor's real-life husband in 1966, gives a quiet, controlled performance that finishes in a mad flourish. George Segal in one of his early roles is also surprisingly effective. Sandy Dennis also gives a phenomenal performance as the mild-mannered Honey. She also won an Oscar, for best supporting actress.The film is well-photographed in crisp black and white, and the camera works well in the context. There is no music in the film, apart from a short scene in which music plays in the background of the scene. Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? is beautiful to look at, but ultimately hard to watch. With the characters constantly screaming at each other and such grim subject matter, the movie is more depressing than anything else. The movie certainly isn't for everyone and I often found myself worn out from watching the film. Two very big thumbs up for the acting, but I found it incredibly depressing and grim. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I believe everyone in this film gives a stunning performance, WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? is Elizabeth Taylor's film all the way. As the loud, hard-drinking Martha, Taylor gives the performance of a lifetime. Miss Taylor has always been at the top of my list of favorite stars, but with this film Elizabeth proves that she has much more than star power. She IS an actress! Taylor's work in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? is some of the finest acting by a major star ever captured on film. In fact, I would say that Miss Taylor's performance is the best ever given by an actress in a motion picture.Elizabeth Taylor has often been called The Most Beautiful Woman In The World, as well as the most glamorous, and I agree completely. But Miss Taylor has always had much more to rely on than her stunning good looks. She is also one of the most gifted actresses to ever grace the Hollywood screen. Oh yes, she definitely has the beauty and glamour, but she also has the talent to match. Taylor won her second Academy Award for WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?, as well as the New York Film Critics, National Board Of Review, and British Film Academy Best Actress Awards.I would like to personally wish Miss Elizabeth Taylor a very healthy and HAPPY BIRTHDAY today. Elizabeth, you truly are THE GREATEST STAR OF ALL TIME! Chad Edwards</fullReview>

Alas,there are few films that tackle the subject of emotional vulnerability so truthfully and even fewer films that do so with such force. I say "vulnerability" because i believe these two characters - George and Martha - are wounded souls that have come to live in an unreal world because of their propensity to explore the outer boundaries of human emotional experience. Score 10 out of 10 for Liz's performance and 9/10 for all three other actors. I want to say something like "a truly wonderful film" but really, it sure aint for everybody.

		<shortDescription>The most powerful film to emerge from the '60's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sixties was a powerful era for moviemaking. Profanity and sex were becoming more common in the film industry, and this is one of the first films to break the barrier and defy the censors. Based on Edward Albee's hit play, WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? centers on George and Martha(Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor), a college professor and his bickering wife. George has his moments, but all-in-all he's a pretty laid back fellow. Martha, however, isn't quite as submissive, and finds an argument in even the most trivial circumstances. The film takes place during one very long evening at George and Martha's house with all sorts of verbal spouts which degenerates into more serious business as the night passes on. The touchy subject that causes the most conflict between the couple is their sixteen-year-old who no one ever sees. These unpleasant events are witnessed by a naive, younger couple(George Segal, Sandy Dennis) who have been invited to the house for the evening, and their visit to the place subsequently threatens to jeopardize their own marriage. The fact that very little has been changed from the original play is great, and the actors(all Oscar-nominated) are terrific. With this film, Elizabeth Taylor fearlessly betrayed her glamorous Hollywood image and took on what still stands as the most challenging role of her career. She also took home the Best Actress Academy Award for 1966. Co-star Sandy Dennis, as the blonde, befuddled Honey, also won an Oscar for her scene-stealing supporting role. This film has lost NONE of its impact, and in some ways, it's more powerful today than ever.</fullReview>

The film was horribly true to the Edward Albee play, and the Taylor-Burton tandem was inevitable to bring the pain and passion to the screen.My comment, thus, would be: get a couple copies of Albee's play, and invite another couple over with you and your beloved. Read the dialogue, and see how much love there IS beneath the hatred, and vice versa. Read the dialogue, playing the parts, and you realize how whacked these two couples are, how much failed-potential plays in their relationships. You also realize that Taylor, Burton, Segal, and Dennis, were PERFECT in their roles! Hard to find a film with that perfection in its casting!Six stars out of five! (sic)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best acted movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" is one of the best movies ever made. Richard Burton plays a college professor named George and Elizabeth Taylor plays his wife, Martha. During a faculty party she invites a new professor and his wife over to her house when the party ends. Their names are Nick and Honey. During the course of the very early morning there will be some startling revelations and occurrences.Richard Burton's performance as Geroge has to be the best performance ever given by a male. It is an extraordinary, towering performance. One of the scenes in which the previous statement is justified is the one in the dance hall/diner. That scene is worth watching over and over. The speech he gives to Nick underneath the tree is the definition of good acting. Every scene he has you want to see twice. His sarcastic remarks are delivered with such joy you start to enjoy them. The scene where he attempts to strangle Martha is harrowing.Elizabeth Taylor is also extraordinary. She has so many great scenes its hard to single one out for praise but one continually sticks out. When she her husband and the guests leave the dance hall and she proclaims "I am not a monster" is mesmerizing. That whole scene is mesmerizing, especially when she gets pushed against the car. Her performance is the definition of a tour de force. That scene where she describes her son's "birth" and "life" is delivered so convincingly its no wonder why she won the Best Actress Oscar that year by acclamation.Sandy Dennis makes a lasting impression as Honey the other professors wife. She has some great scenes where she acts up a storm. This is the type of performance where the best scenes come at the end, but there worth waitng for. She won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in this movie.Geroge Segal does some greatly understated work but his character by the end gets overshadowed in my opinion by the others. His scenes where he spars with Geroge are very good but they are completly dominated by Richard Burton. This was directed excitingly and richly by Mike Nichols in is directorial debut. I wonder if his best director win for The Graduate was a make up for his losing for this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be frank, I didn't have a clue what the movie was about until I saw it. The title had me wondering if it might not be the life of the writer Virginia Woolf. I didn't know what to expect from this movie. But now that I've seen it and know what it's all about, I can't say I was too impressed by this movie.  The story basically centers around the life of an unhappy couple (Taylor and Burton) who invite another couple (Seagal and Dennis) one night very late after some party held by the school principal for whom Burton works for. But as soon as you see the way Burton and Taylor act toward one another and the way Taylor radically changes moods, you already know what's probably going to happen: The guests are going to get to the house and witness a traumatizing scene between the unhappy couple. The already predictable act happens and we learn a lot of things about Burton's personality (an apparent murder of his parents and a confusing apparent murder of his own son).  One of the reasons I didn't like this movie is because it was a character study that somewhat resembles "A streetcar named Desire" at some moments in the movie. The movie was based on the play by Edward Albee and probably loses a lot since the play is designed for only four actors and three settings. Overall, the movie isn't a turkey. If you like Elizabeth Taylor, you should see it for it's probably one of her best performances ever. All I'm stating is that I wasn't thrilled by this movie. To put this simply, it's nothing like "The godfather".</fullReview>

However, for discerning adults, it's a grown-up game of pain with rewards throughout. Burton and Taylor are two human land-mines, dodging each other, and it is an amazing acting workout for both (Taylor and supporting actress Sandy Dennis won Oscars, yet Richard Burton is nearly flawless as well). By the end, the couple are spent, unraveled, and lonely for the past. Perhaps these two were "Ozzie and Harriet" at one time, and this is what life has done to them.

Mike Nichols (The Graduate) directs for the first time and he is assisted by the great cinematography of Haskell Wexler (Bound for Glory).

I went with a good friend of mine, whose idea it was, (also a white man), and I was agape, the entire performance. I mean, it really was ASTOUNDING! The stage was set down low, surrounded on all sides by the audience. When they, on stage, set out a dish of candy, he and I both started to get up to get some (but stopped ourselves, fortunately.) The whole thing was so intense, so emotionally WRINGING!!!As we walked to the train station to go back home, I said, "They ought to make a movie out of that!" He nonchalantly said, "They have."I said, "REALLY? Who was in it?"He told me, and I said, "But... but... they're all white!"He said, "Correct!" I said, "Well...... did it still work?"(See, I had thought of it in exclusively black terms. I thought of the poor black professor, who couldn't make it at the black university, who was beaten down, by his fat black wife, who was confronted by the new, young, up-and-coming black biology professor, etc, etc...")He said, "Yes, it worked quite well."I then realized the unconscious racism in all of us. At least all of us white people. I later saw the movie and I was absolutely FLOORED! My god what a film. Whew!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The Directing, cinematography, sets etc are all excellent but it's the acting that astounds. George Segal gives a solid performance but is overshadowed by the other three. Richard Burton adds depth and reality to an often underplayed (on stage) role. Sandy Dennis is brilliant. Watch again her reactions when the others have center stage. Her acting gives her underwritten character life and meaning and emotions beyond the script. But this is Elizabeth Taylor's film. There are three separate scenes (I'm sure you will be able to pick them) where her acting is so good that all acting students should be made to watch. If they don't appreciate the level she attains, throw them out of acting class. If they don't know what good acting is they can never be good actors. Watch this movie more than once. Each viewing will reveal another layer of meaning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One only has sympathy for these ultimately dysfunctional characters as they unfold their little "fun and games," like "Down the Host," "Hump the Hostess," and "Get the Guests." If only George and Martha had retired a wee bit earlier none of this would've happened. Then, too, why didn't Nick and Honey simply leave, rather than stick around for the "full treatment"? Can it be that "like attracts like," so much so that they couldn't leave? The final denouement suggests that a new day may be in the offing for poor Martha and George, after the latter has "killed off the 'little bugger.' " Although Martha's admittedly still fearful, she clings firmly to George's hand. Perhaps there's some hope, anyway, for this emotionally spent couple.Edward Albee, taking no small degree of awareness from Tennessee Williams and Harold Pinter, crafted a play that certainly communicated to a goodly number of people. Personally recalling sitting in its Broadway run, watching Uta Hagen and cast go through their paces, I remember being as impressed with the riotous audience laughter as with the play itself. The raw lines coming from up-to-then very respectable status characters, namely college prof and wife, seemed to provide some kind of early 60s liberation from the staid and repressive 50s. By the time the film was released in '66, the public was ready for its no-holds-barred dialogue. It ushered in an new era of social upheaval, of which we're still feeling the effects today. The "boozy battle" between the hosts, hosts and guests, and guests and guests, paralleled the cultural "steam" being released during that politically "hot" period. The American home drastically changed as a nation experienced more domestic squabbles, separations, divorces, custody battles, and family breakdowns--the last including a noted demise of the traditional "family meal." In Albee's "long night's journey into morning," the audience must endure two hours of fighting, bickering, insulting, and lamenting before any ray of hope is introduced (during its last five minutes). A long time to wait, but there it is: a glimmer that there may be something better ahead. But we're not sure; after all, "Is this fact or fiction, Martha?"In an extensive GM Quarterly interview, Director Mike Nichols revealed that this was a very troubled production that almost didn't get finished--with a leading cast boozing and pill-dosing even during lunch breaks--stretching the very limits of professionalism.Yet in the end, Nichols, Cinematographer Haskell Wexler, and Composer Alex North all got what they wanted. A question is, "was it all worth the effort?" That's something only the individual viewer can answer: is this a case of "nothing from nothing leaves nothing?" or "a cathartic and emotionally moving experience?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can not rave about this movie enough. It is thoroughly captivating and interestingly complex. Be warned- It is supremely brutal in places ! It begins with an impassioned and intriguing opening from Taylor and Burton. The couple are expecting house guests "Nick". (George Segal ) and "Honey". (Sandy Dennis) to come over for a, how shall put it ? Drinking session and a chat. There is not a simple cup of hot chocolate in sight. Believe me, this is no cosy night cap ! The couple turn up much to George's. (Richard Burton) incredible disappointment and they start a night full of shenanigans. It soon becomes obvious that Nicks wife isn't the sharpest tool in the box and appears to be completely oblivious to the travesty that is George and Martha's relationship. There is a line in this movie that sticks out the me the most, it is Martha referring to her Husband George as a "dump ". "What a dump" she say's to him or more like shouts at him. What a charming lady she is. Nick however is astute and intelligent enough to see the bizarre dynamics and the outrageous complexity that becomes more and more apparent as the film evolves. Martha flirts with him incessantly and George doesn't stop testing him and questioning him. Nick becomes increasingly uncomfortable in their company and can't wait to leave. But really, can you blame him ? The relationship of Martha and George is an incredibly dysfunctional one,their love for each other is non existent and they are constantly locking horns, arguing over meaningless topics and belittling one another. To say they are a unsuitable match is an understatement ! So much so that throughout the film you begin to wonder what actually keeps them together. Even at the beginning of the film it becomes strikingly obvious that they feed of each others negativity and will stop at nothing to insult, demean and verbally attack each other. Especially in Martha's case. (Elizabeth Taylor).Throughout the movie you begin to feel a certain kind of empathy for George. (Richard Burton . You see him as the bullied husband of a cruel, vicious and vindictive wife. But there is far more to this movie than meets the eye. The dynamics in their relationship unravel and you learn more about their characters.Even though the movie revolves around stupendous Elizabeth Taylor and the mighty Richard Burton, George Segal and Sandy Dennis are also outstanding. I have to say for a movie with only four characters. (With exception of the bar man )it is absolutely magnificent. While watching I remained enthralled, captivated and fascinated all the way through. The only setting of the movie is George and Martha's house and a bar. And still there is never a dull moment. This movie is full of surprises and shock. I gasped in quite a few places. The outright vileness, audaciousness and anger of Martha is just inexplicable. And then you have the somewhat confused and sorrowful George who has quite clearly had an earful of verbal brutality and abuse over the years.After watching this movie I can honestly and whole heartedly say that it's one of the best damn movie's I've ever had the pleasure of viewing. The performances of the cast are all equally remarkable. I'm flabbergasted to find out that Richard Burton did not win an Oscar for his part. His performance as the bewildered George is absolutely phenomenal and completely deserving of an Oscar.As for the marvellous Miss Taylor she did get her well deserved Oscar. Her performance as the horrid yet vunrerable Martha is astonishingly brilliant. She is a woman full of contradictions, delusion, depravity and spite. Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor work together and compliment each other like no other actor and actress have ever done. The on screen chemistry is just breathtaking. They truly do enhance each others performances.This is a movie of great depth and ever greater intellect, it's certainly not for the shallow minded ! !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's Scene Stealing Performance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I don't fully get the toxic energy and relationship between Martha and George and their unsuspecting guests, Honey and her husband, the biology professor. Edward Albee wrote the play which was a sensation of it's time. Strong mature actresses like Uta Hagen and Constance Cummings have turned Martha into a sympathetic and likable character. Dame Elizabeth Taylor does the same here for Martha. She won her second Oscar for playing a complicated mature woman married to George. George and Martha's marriage unravels late in the night when they invite a young couple played by Oscar winner Sandy Dennis and George Segal to their home on a college campus after a late night party at her father's house. Martha's father is the college president. Throughout the two and half-hours, we get to know a lot about both couples, good and bad. In the end, you feel sorry for the games they play but marriage is a game in itself. George and Martha seem to thrive on an audience as they indulge in their serious games.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Ground breaking Hollywood made motion picture that holds back no punches or takes no prisoners in it's in your face language and sexual innuendos of a troubled couple who's over 15 year old marriage is about to come apart.Coming home one one evening from a collage facility party the already good and drunk daughter of the collage president Martha, Elizabeth Taylor, starts to have it out with her passive and henpecked husband collage history professor George, Richard Burton, about everything under the sun especially what a rotten husband and lover he is! This kind of thing seems to be typical among the battling couple with them making up almost as soon has hostilities commence. Having young 28 year-old biology teacher Nick,George Segal,and his 26 year old mosey looking and neurotic wife Honey,Sandy Dennis come over for a nightcap the drinking and feuding continues all throughout the evening with Honey, who can't keep up with rest of the party goers, getting sick from all the booze she consumed.George who takes every kind of insult that his wife Martha throws at him is later really ticked off when Honey asks him about his son that a drunken Martha blurted, or belched, out about when she was talking things over with her in private. This somehow set something off in George's head who suddenly started to go after Martha like a bull at the sight of a red flag! The meek and quite George now turns the tables on Martha in her bringing up the taboo subject, the couples son and what happened to him, that she and him promised each other to never talk about in private and especially, by Martha telling Honey about it, in public!The film and the drinking goes on non-stop with a rude and uncivil George also getting the info from a drunk as a skunk Nick the circumstances behind his and Honey's relationship before they got married. Tearing into Honey about her fear of having children has an outraged Nick, who was a middleweight boxing champion in collage, almost belt George but he's either too drunk or too civilized, he's a good 15 years younger then George, to do it!***SPOILERS*** It's later in the movie that we and Nick find out that George was using psychological warfare on Martha to get her over her hangup about their son who in fact was killed in a car accident some time ago when he was in his teens. Never telling Martha that her and his son was dead was the only way for George to keep her sanity but what it did was have the poor and mentally unstable woman hit the bottle big time. With George in him trying to placate her hitting the bottle along with her! It's in her coming to terms with the fact that her son is no longer here that had Martha finally overcome her psychosis as well as her drinking problem. And it was in Martha's unconsciously bringing up her and George's son to Honey that in fact brought that all about.The gorgeous and shapely Elizabeth Taylor, who won and Academy Award as Martha, really went into the part she had in the film by gaining some 30 pounds and looking at least 15 years older to make herself believable in it. Miss Taylor seemed to get older and heavier, looking like a sack of Idaho potatoes, as the film went on. This was the same drop dead gorgeous Elizabeth Taylor who made hearts melt and heads turn just a scant few years ago in movies like "Suddendly last Summer" "Butterfield 8" and "Cleopartra" when she was considered to be the most beautiful and sexist woman in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hope I don't get too many responses to my diatribe, but here goes. The only reason I have a copy of the film Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is because I lost my copy of the recorded play starring Ute Hagan. My main beef about the film is that martha is a 52 year old woman and George is 46. That very fact says volumes as to why these two people would treat each other this way and say the things that they say to one another. Elizabeth Taylor is just too young to play Martha and I've always found her performance over-reaching. Burton is of course always brilliant and could play George at any age and still make him believable. There is a scene where Burton does not have any dialog and all you see his the back of his sweater, but there is so much emotion in that scene that you know you are in the presence of great acting. Back to the age situation. George and Martha have been playing at this for years and with the diluting of the ages for the screen only makes the characters yelling at each other uncomfortable, and you wonder why would they stay with each other when both are young enough to find other mates. Anyway, Albee's dialog is worth the price of owing the movie. Now, if only some smart director would film the Kathleen Turner's stage version then we might have a Martha we could really cheer for. P.S. Elizabeth Taylor is one of my very favorite actress so I could never put her down completely. I just don't see her as Martha. Sad, sad, sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Albee's greatest play makes a perfect transition to the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many attempts have been made, to transpose a theatrical play into a good movie and many have failed. This one succeeds gloriously, largely because the theatrical atmosphere - with stage rather than cinematic moods and setting - is rigorously sustained. After the initial scene, with what appears to be a harmonious couple walking across a campus (our first and last glimpse at the real world outside) the entire action, for the rest of the film is locked into sets as confined as a theatre stage.The agonies of George's and Martha's marriage unfold within those tatty, dusty sets, at a cracking pace and it is impossible not to be drawn into the action. Their dysfunctional relationship is made all the more painful when paraded in front of their injudiciously invited guests - a younger, more idealistic couple. As the booze flows, values shift, cracks widen, loyalties switch and, as a viewer, one feels increasingly uneasy about where to place one's sympathies.Edward Albee is a great playwright, easily in the top American three, along with Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams, but that alone would not make a film. (Think how many awful Shakespeare films there are in the world!) What makes this film succeed is the impeccable casting. Taylor and Burton are better than in anything made, before or since. His shabby academic, and her frustrated, discontented university wife are totally convincing but the supporting roles by Segal and Dennis round off the acting to a tee.I first watched this film when living on an Ivy League campus, in the 1960s and was deeply moved by the experience. I have seen the play performed by amateurs and professionals - ironically, the best production was by a local amateur group in the UK - and recently re- watched the film on video. I still leave it as impressed as I was in the 60s. One of my top 100 movies for sure. Do not miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over the top, but nevertheless a terrific movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason why I think I enjoyed this movie so much was due to the fact that I was in theater and participated in the drama club, we studied this play and I always wondered how it would be acted out since we never got the chance. I didn't know there was a movie about the play and my mom thankfully had it, not to mention Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton? I slipped it in immediately and was so impressed with this terrific drama.It's about an aging couple who has had one too many drinks in the night after a party, you can tell they have a lot of hidden anger towards each other. But it isn't until a couple that Martha, played by Taylor, invited over that brings out all their anger and hatred of each other. Not to mention some horrible tragedy strikes when Martha learns of what has happened to their son.I'm not sure exactly how to describe the plot, because you could go into massive details, like I said, I studied it. But I really enjoyed this dark drama, like I said, if you don't enjoy over the top acting, you might want to steer away from it. But it is a great movie and has some dark humor in it that lightens the story somewhat. But please, take a good look at this movie, it's a good one.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George, a college professor, and his wife Martha are a middle-aged couple in a not-so-happy marriage. One night, Martha invites guests over - a new professor at the university and his young wife. Then George and Martha use to the younger couple to get at each others nerves in to what eventually turns into a psychological war.Based on a play the film is very theatrical in its settings. There are only a few and they tend to be very confined, even when outside with the camera almost always sticking close to characters. But just like in "12 Angry Men" it is precisely that which makes the film riveting. In such a little space Mike Nichols moves the camera in almost every possible way making for a very cinematic presentation which is only matched by the fiery performances. With just four characters the cast puts in enough subtlety and detail into each one that there is enough room for 10 characters from most other films. Elizabeth Taylor steals practically the whole movie in her Oscar winning performance and it is darkly amusing to see such a pretty leading lady turn into a monster right before your very eyes and then down into a weeping and vulnerable woman as the "psychological war" takes its toll on all those involved. Richard Burton is no less fascinating as her emotionally callous husband.The movie drags a bit in parts, but even after watching it you won't be sure of what exactly you'd like to see gone since it is all so good. 9/10Not Rated, but has mature themes and profanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film in the world!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is arguably the best Taylor-Burton collaboration from the history of their extensive joint movie careers. "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" is a profound and rip-roaringly precise examination of the human psyche. Although Taylor won the Oscar (deservedly), Burton is once again under-appreciated by the industry and some critics alike. In scenes such as George's soliloquy in the garden, Burton manages to portray an intelligent, deeply intellectual man who is oppressed and misunderstood completely, or perhaps understood too well by his overbearing wife. Burton actually uses his facial expressions and physical gestures rather than his trademark booming voice for effect in this film. This works splendidly, particularly when he is framed in between Sandy Dennis and George Segal. The idea was to focus attention on Burton's eyes without using a close up and it does work perfectly. A rather sad and nostalgic effect is achieved through the two younger characters facing him who have their entire lives before them, whilst George has struggled through his own mere existence. The resentment felt by George is so clear in Burton's eyes as they sparkle with tears and become dull with a feeling of complete uselessness for the character. As in other films, Burton does use his voice, only a little less frequently. His ability to change tone, volume and characteristic, vocally, are second to none. This is particularly evident in the scene where George destroys Martha's facade about their son. By using the malevolence of tone, fluctuating volume and harsh realism that Burton familiarised himself with through much of his early cinema, George ultimately deconstructs Martha's lies in the most devastating way he can. Burton conveys the absolute core of George, a broken man who has little use for his life, as though it really were himself. Taylor's performance is also outstanding. Whenever she gives a good performance, (which is more often than she is credited for) people are usually shocked. Perhaps this is because of her colourful personal life and the public need to chisel through it before her performance can actually be criticised. There is not a scene in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" where she is not memorable. From her exclamation of "What a dump!" - alluding to the Bette Davis' film "Beyond the Forest" - to her excruciatingly brilliant deliverance of the final speech about her son, Taylor is truly on top form. In the former scene she carries out the infamous chicken eating sequence and speaks to George in a fashion that resembles some form of perceived 'normality', yet for it's time it is the most unnatural behaviour of a stereotypical 1960's American couple.While Edward Albee is to be thanked for this, Burton &amp; Taylor only compliment his work. The dialogue in the chicken-eating sequence is portrayed as though this tension and hatred of each other is the norm for the couple. Martha: "We've got guests." George: "Got what?" Martha: "Guests. Guests!" George: "Guests?" Martha: "Yeah, guests. People! We've got guests coming over." Martha's soliloquy about their son is one of the best delivered speeches in the film. The trembling voice, the tattered appearance - so unusual in a Taylor film - and the exhausted expression combined, make it a superb deliverance. Burton's satirical interruptions with passages from the Last Rites in Latin are also brilliant and add to the drama. Sandy Dennis and George Segal are excellently cast also, especially Dennis. Segal notably won that year for Best Actor, beating Burton oddly enough. Dennis sparkles with youth and naivete particularly in the last scene. Her innocence is perfect as she attempts to stop George from destroying Martha when he tells her about the death of their son. Dennis also won in 1966 for Best Supporting Actress for the film, deserving nothing less. "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" is possibly one of the most trying films to watch at times as it is terribly depressing and heavy, yet vividly relatable and tangible. Many have said that Burton finally found the serious role that he searched for all his life in his final film "1984", but this film is my personal favourite of his. It is another factor which makes the film depressing, that Richard Jenkins was once again robbed of the recognition he so richly deserved from one of the few great roles of his career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) As usual, she co-stars with Burton, but this time Liz has lost her glamour, by purposely gaining weight and dying her hair gray to appear ten years older. It works, as does the biting story.Basically the action occurs over the course of an evening. Martha (Liz) and her professorial husband George (Richard Burton) have invited a younger teacher George Segal) and his wife (Sandy Dennis) to their home for cocktails,. That's when the fun, or rather the fights, begin. Burton and Taylor badger and bait one another with a ferocity that has rarely been shown between a filmdom couple. Purportedly, the films onscreen battles helped facilitate the deterioration of their own off-screen romance.The Taylor in this movie is transformed. Never before or since have we seen Taylor the actress push herself so hard. She snarls, she hisses, she teases. She scares the hell out of you. She showed the world that behind that gorgeous face and body, that she could, if she chose to,hold her own with the best of em.

		<fullReview>If ever there were a powerhouse of a film, it's this one! Elizabeth Taylor gives the seminal performance of her entire career. She is electric from start to finish. Richard Burton is equally superb in his role, underscoring Taylor's furor with his own subdued vengeance. I think it only adds to the realism that they were actually married to each other at the time they made this film.George Segal and Sandy Dennis are also fantastic in their roles. Dennis' facial expressions alone are worthy of her Oscar success for this film. The black and white photography is striking, and in addition to the fantastic acting, the dialogue is, of course, potent. The change of locale for a couple scenes (the front yard, diner, parking lot) doesn't take away anything from the claustrophobic feel of the film. Nichols' direction is right on the mark. The use of close-ups and angled camera shots contributes to this greatly, and Alex North's music also adds to the dreamy, night time atmosphere.Definitely one of the high points of 1960s cinema, and one of the best adaptations of a stage play to a film. This is one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. A thrilling, roller coaster-ride of an experience, not relying on special effects or audacious visuals, but on the wit of sharp writing, grade-A acting, and careful production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The More Deserved of Liz's Oscars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1961 Elizabeth Taylor won a very controversial Oscar for the soap opera Butterfield 8. Many people thought she didn't deserve it, but when she won for this film it was very well deserved. Her performance as Martha is probably the best of her career as she deglamorized herself to play a woman who was obviously worn down after several years in a loveless marriage. However, not only was Liz great in this film, but the entire cast made this film what it was. Too bad Richard Burton didn't win. He was one of the greatest actors of his time and he was constantly denied the biggest prize in his profession.However, this film is not for the faint at heart. If you aren't used to verbal brutality and high tension, this is not the film for you. This is still a very disturbing film that pretty much went against the grain of films that portrayed marriage as happy and loving. It is a very powerful film that deserved all the accolades it got.</fullReview>

I remember liking it, but then the film began to fester in my memory, doubts popping up like mushrooms. I began to feel used. The viewer isn't given something, he is made to give something: time, attention, money. And the makers of this orgy of neurosis obviously believe that the viewer owes it to them. Freud, a discredited complication artist, seems to loom large in this film, which seems to imply that there are dark recesses to the human mind that need to be cleansed and ventilated. Not so. The human mind is blissfully shallow. Let's keep it that way! My favorite Liz Taylor movie - and there aren't many - is still "A Date with Judy".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Not entertaining"? Surely this misses part of the point: the one-liners, ironic remarks, insults, comebacks and academic puns are nasty, to be sure, but they're also (let's be honest) very, very funny ... and even if you don't find them funny, there's a certain joy - that's right, joy - in watching the sheer skill with which George and Martha lob darts at the sensitive parts of each other's anatomy. The film wouldn't be chilling if it WEREN'T entertaining. If it were mere unrelenting, stupid misery, then (a) nobody would get past the first reel, and (b) George and Martha would be like members of an alien species; if there were no aesthetic merit, so to speak, in George's insults, we wouldn't know why he uttered them.The audience I saw it with were, in fact, chortling relentlessly most of the way, and I'm sure THEY missed part of the point, too. It's funny, but not funny in that way. An audience alive to the drama will wait to see where the latest witticism will lead rather than laugh immediately. (By the way: people who, at ANY point during ANY movie, laugh uproariously and then sigh and say "Oh, dear", as THREE members of the audience within earshot of me did, oughtn't be allowed to watch movies at all; at least, not in public.) I won't say where it leads in the end, partly because I'm still not sure. The moments preceding the ending require active deciphering, before we even begin to attend to the more interesting question of what comes next, or even whether or not we are being held out any hope.To the extent that the film IS hard to sit through (perhaps it is, a tiny little bit, here and there) it's not because of the cruelty or suffering, but because it's been adapted from a play - not just any play, but one set in real time, with four characters verbally assaulting one another in a confined space. Such plays are likely to come across on screen as nothing more than dense thickets of words. Mike Nichols has done a good job of preventing this. There's rich black cinematography and a score by Alex North (sounding vaguely like one of those 1960s combinations of jazz and Bach) which manages to sound relaxed and alert at the same time, but mostly it's Nichols's versatility with the camera: among the many effective touches is his habit of suddenly breaking what appears to be naturalistic, unforced middle-distance framing to dart in for a telling ultra-close-up.The couples are closely but asymmetrically matched (Martha has brazen natural force, George has verbal dexterity; thus, Elizabeth Taylor gives the richer and stronger performance, Richard Burton gets the best lines). Each of the four actors does well in a different way.</fullReview>

Her unusual demeanor added flair to the role, giving her a demented mindset which was equaled by Richard Burton. Not for everyone, this film must be enjoyed after reading the book of the same name. Watch it if you ever get the opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ground-breaking, roller-coaster of a great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, a scathing cauldron of love-hate, shocked audiences with its frank, unusually foul-mouthed narrative when it went on Broadway in the 1962-63 season and lost none of it's power in the transition to the screen. Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in their only really great film they made together star as George and Martha, an embattled couple swapping endless cut-lows, throwing curse words back and forth and finally making a last grasp at what's left of their marriage. Burton is easily at his finest hour in this film as George, the dry-witted yet world-weary college professor and Taylor turns in an unusually powerful performance as the shrewish Martha. The supporting cast consists of basically two other players; George Segal and Sandy Dennis are the young couple Nick and Honey. Dennis plays Honey brilliantly and Segal is really likable as always as Nick. This is also the first film to contain profanity and it predates the rating system which places the film in a unique position in film history. Mike Nichols' directorial debut is phenomenal. You'd think that even though he's got noteworthy theater experience his first film would get no more than mediocre reviews. As with Sam Mendes in American BEAUTY, Nichols turned his first film into a brilliant piece. It's subject matter isn't always light but it still turns out to be an unabashed work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not many movies give me a strange feeling inside but "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" gave me just that. Here is a movie that doesn't have any blood, guts, or horror....only words. It were these words that made my skin crawl and to have dialogue deeply effect me proves that this film gripped me from start to finish. Taylor and Burton are equally marvelous as well as Segal and Dennis who are permanently scarred for life after the all-night event is over....through the most brutal, manipulative, abusive and honest words I've ever seen in a movie. To accomplish this in 1966 and have it stand the test of time 35 years later is simply a grand achievement and makes this a timeless classic.The scene where Richard Burton spins Sandy Dennis around in a circle while shouting "WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?" at her until she throws up is one of the great (and creepy) moments in this realistic piece of americana.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homage to Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure I can add much to Rathko from LA's perceptive and obviously loving take on this movie. It truly is one of the best American Films ever made. It is without a doubt Elizabeth Taylor's Tour de Force. This was Richard Burton's best and most complex role as well. He was playing totally against type, seemingly, but the evolution of his character, from henpecked to irritated, to aggressive, to angry, and finally to vindictive, was played to perfection, and crafted in a way only English actors of the old school can do. I think he knew that Elizabeth was giving the performance of a lifetime and he plays off of that. He is giving her the canvas on which she paints Martha. I understand this was painful for her emotionally and physically. She put her heart, soul and body out there for us to see what Albee envisioned and Richard Burton enabled. But she achieved it.What makes the film extraordinary and ultimately satisfying is that despite the seeming hatred, jealousy, boredom, disrespect, disconnection - everything that can go wrong with a relationship - there remains this desperate need, if not love, for each other. But maybe it is love. Love is need - Need is love - two ends of a spectrum. This desperation ultimately explains the relationship. Love and desperation become one. It was never about the child. George and Martha are two lost children themselves who will never find their way out. But the circle is unbroken - they end up where they started. As do we all.Beautifully adapted from a sterling stage play. Magnificently photographed in glorious Black and White. And of course you were waiting for me to mention Sandy Dennis and George Segal. A younger counterpoint to George and Martha. But they will avoid that fate. Won't they? Will the circle be unbroken?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Striking Directorial Debut.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Nichols' first film is a punch-in-the-stomach of a movie that showed off the enormous skills of Elizabeth Taylor (Oscar-winning) and Richard Burton (Oscar-nominated). A quiet and fun evening for college professors (Burton and George Segal, Oscar-nominated) and their wives (Taylor and Oscar-winner Sandy Dennis) starts out wild with drinking and partying and gets wilder when the fun dies down. "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" is dark and disturbing film-making. The film is not entertaining and is downright hard to get through to be blunt. However, it is a character study that is carried almost exclusively by its four key players. The film is shot in black-and-white and as the you watch you will feel gray all over. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Or maybe hate/love. There are moments in Virginia Woolf where you can see the love between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. There are more moments, however, you see the unwavering animosity between them. The movie has two main themes: love vs. hate and truth vs. illusion. Taylor and Burton are terrific. George Segal and Sandy Dennis play their parts to a tee as well. Personally, I rate this movie towards the top of my list. It is tough to watch sometimes, and you are likely to form some opinions about who's more to blame, Burton or Taylor. I actually watched this with my girlfriend and we immediately started taking sides. It's one that will stick to you and make you think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw the play but I saw the film the other night on tv and I had read all the praise it has gotten. I can´t see nothing sort of amazing about this film. It is about two couples other one is middle aged and the other one is young. This film happens one night and the older couple invites the younger in for a drink about 10 o´clock and the rest of the night invlolves fighting, banging on doors, screaming and stuff. Not only are the characters annoying but the film lacks in any real emoition and you just see some fat woman fighting with her pretentious husband. The young woman is acting like a Psycho and the young man thinks he is the hottest guy on earth. Fun. This film was also boring and by the end of it you feel what was I watching. Everyone has hailed the acting and the script and the direction. Nothing seems special to me. This was Mike Nichols debut as a director and It is not his best and he is overall very overrated director if I may say so. And why is this film ( Play). called Who´s Afraid Of Virginia Woolf. I sure don´t know. Overall 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>scenes from a marriage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A guilty pleasure of watching "Virginia Woolf" is wondering where the lines blur between life and art, and when Burton and Taylor toss George and Martha aside and go at it as real-life husband and wife. Unless Ernest Lehman or Edward Albee wrote the dialogue, I doubt that anything Burton and Taylor said behind closed doors quite matches that of the movie. Deliciously filmed in black and white, this movie is pure adult entertainment with two of the greatest English-speaking actors of the 20th Century working at the peak of their powers. Liz won the Oscar, deservedly so, but with a lesser actor than Burton to bounce lines off, she would suffocate the film. As it is, she barely holds her own, taking a knife to a verbal gunfight. For reasons I can't explain, I find the movie entertaining upon repeated viewings, unlike "A Streetcar Named Desire," which I could only endure one time. Watching mental cruelty, as dished out by George and Martha, somehow is much more perverse than watching sex acts depicted on screen. Other movies have pushed the envelope farther with regards to sex and language, but none in 35 years holds a candle to "Virginia Woolf" for guilty pleasure. As Martha said to George, "A thousand years with you is quite enough."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be the absolute best movie I have ever seen. I would say it was beyond its time, yet the history of the human mind has had no time frame in its intellect since the caveman. It is beautiful how to a viewer not so sharp...this film would seem to be a bunch of drunken fighting, including some scenes that should rile mates to a battle over touching another's. Yet, since one couple is comfortable (the elder couple), the younger couple seems to fall in place of the game. It is this game that the average viewer would not see. It is this game that keeps the elder couple together, keeps them thriving. And to any one who does not see this game, the elder couple will appear quite insane. It started as this... Martha tells their new friends embarrassing things, stories about George. This is the first hit in the game. It is after this that George gets his umbrella gun. This is the second hit. The third hit comes when Martha dances vulgarly with the other man. The fourth comes quickly after that when George makes light of the couples miscarriage. The last two hits I find are the best... The fifth hit comes when Martha sleeps with the other man, or at least attempts to (he seemed to be a houseboy). The sixth and last hit is when George wins the game by killing off their non-existent son. He wins himself a friend, the man who attempted to be with his wife but claimed, "I think I understand this." in the end. (For he understood a game was being played.) And Martha loses the game, losing their false son and perhaps the chance to move on to a new couple to play games with. Her new friend in this is the young woman. The young woman that had the miscarriage. This woman does not understand the game or much of anything else. This is how George has 4 up on Martha.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most amazing films to come out of the 1960's was the film version of Edward Albee's absurdist vision WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINA WOOLF? When I was in a high school acting class, my teacher told us he wanted us to see an example of really great acting and he introduced me to VIRGINIA WOOLF for the first time and I must agree. This scathing 1966 drama follows a drunken night between two college professors, one young and one not so, and their wives and the secrets, lies, and revelations that come out during their drunken encounter. Elizabeth Taylor won her second Oscar for her performance as Martha, a character who redefines the term "shrew", the older professor's wife and the daughter of the president of the college(a character who we never meet but is mentioned throughout). Taylor pulled out all the stops for this performance...she put on twenty pounds, wore extra padding, grayed her hair, wore false teeth, and pitched her voice extreme low and buried her English accent for the most part to deliver the most electrifying performance of her career. Some found it over the top, but I find the performance continually fascinating and treasure the little nuances I discover in Martha upon repeated viewings. Richard Burton was robbed of a Best Actor Oscar for his performance as George, Martha's emasculated husband who does his best to learn the rules of Martha's little games as fast as she can change them. Burton is just as funny as he is heartbreaking and beautifully underplays in order to allow Taylor to shine. George Segal and Sandy Dennis (in her Oscar winning film debut)provide solid support to the Burtons as the new young professor and his wife, who fall victim to the twisted machinations of George and Martha. This film was considered quite controversial in 1966. It seems quite tamer now but still packs an emotional wallop and is not for the faint of heart. Mike Nichols' intense direction and loving attention to Albee's script are a big plus here and help to make WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? a shattering and haunting film experience that stays with you long after the final fadeout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard so much about this film and it's performances and FINALLY got around to renting it a few nights ago. I am still thinking about it. The plot has been mentioned in almost every post and it's simplicity is almost frightening. George and Martha are a anything but happily married couple who seem to thrive on insulting each other in the most hurtful possible ways. From the opening scene, they are arguing about that name of a Bette Davis film and Martha is drinking the booze like it is water. We then learn that a young couple are on their way over for an evening of drinks and "getting to know each other" chat. Nothing could compare them for the psychological nightmare that awaits. Elizabeth Taylor as Martha gives one of the most powerfully ferocious performances EVER caught on films. She is absolutely volcanic in her non-stop verbal daggers and her scene in the dance hall parking lot remains the best piece of acting I have ever witnessed. She earned every centimeter of the Oscar that she won. Matching her almost every step of the way is Richard Burton, who is almost equally as ruthless in his attempts and his "get the guest" game is painful to watch. How he didn't win the Oscar is beyond me. George Segal as Nick, one of the ill-fated guests is adequate and I was impressed my his restraint and reactions to each situation. Now on to Sandy Dennis as Honey, the mousey wife of Nick. WOW!!! For me, she made this movie, stealing every scene she was in, even from Liz!! Her performance is so layered and her drunken babblings are phenomenal. Her reaction to George's "get the guest" game is heartbreaking and I felt SO SO sorry for her. That is, until the end of the film, when we realize she isn't the innocent ditz that we were led to believe. Like Ms. Taylor, she earned EVERY bit of the Oscar she won for this. This movie is twisted and in the end, nothing is really resolved; it is up the the viewer to decipher George &amp; Martha's madness. I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates good drama and outstanding acting; George and Martha's marriage makes both Matt &amp; Ruth Fowler's (In the Bedroom) and Lester and Carolyn Burnham's (American Beauty) look like the American ideal. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't enjoy it at all (very disappointed after all the hype).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having heard about this alleged "classic" ever since it debuted when I was a child, I finally got around to seeing it on DVD, and I was very disappointed! I checked the *contains spoiler* box just in case but I won't go into the plot in detail here. First of all, IMHO Albee's story was what it was and that's inescapable (on its merits I would give it a five of ten stars having never read it--I think the film dialogue is quite clunky at times): if I was a Hollywood director (long a dream of mine) no way in hell would I have chosen to make a film of the play of THAT book/story!So what is all the hype about?? Same old studio b.s. I think. It's just that with so many talents in one film, the multiple Oscar nominations (but thirteen?? Geez, no way!) were probably inevitable. As you can see, I would only rate it two out of ten stars (or one out of four). Here's why: Both Taylor and Burton are highly accomplished, skilled actors at the top of their form in this era. But I think they both overreached and overacted in this film. The script was really awful IMHO. I didn't like it enough to recall the many awkward lines, but there are plenty of them (the writing might have fit public taste in the 50s, but certainly doesn't hold up now). This opinion has nothing to do with so-called "decency" or mores--I'm a die-hard liberal.Again, I'd have never chosen to film the play of the book, so that's strike one. Strike two for me was the direction... the pacing is poor: it has almost no plot momentum and is filled with awkward silences (which I realize were probably intentional and part of the story/Nichols's choice to dramatize the heavily slanted relationships he was trying to portray). Each character seems to stand in contrast to the other, as if the director said, "you just get into your part and don't have chemistry with the other actors as in an ensemble piece (which is apparently how it was intended to happen on stage)." When I read on the DVD that they spent 20 weeks filming this on the Warner lot, it dawned on me: here was Hollywood's top acting power couple screwing off for five months and getting paid handsomely. Well good for them (but that doesn't mean I have to love it). I feel sorry for Mike Nichols being so "successful" his first time out; it probably means his standards were that much lower (and although I'm a total nobody in Hollywood, they're far below mine; if I had five months on sound stages to do this film, I could have done it a lot better!).On the positive side, I think the b&amp;w cinematography was excellent (as in all of Haskell Wexler's work!) and the editing, too. But they couldn't compensate for lame direction and overwrought acting performances borne of ignorant, selfish, quirky readings of the original work. Taylor's Oscar may have (in context of the year's other mostly not memorable fare) been somewhat deserved: she is a great American actress... but that in itself doesn't hold the rest of the parts of this film together for me.The only reason I give it any stars is that there are a few dramatic moments (and the cinematography and editing), like the first gun surprise, that were done quite well. But I'm just sure that it must have worked far better on stage. Burton's expansive gestures and incredible dramatic voice would have been far better utilized in a film of Macbeth or other Shakespeare play, not this! I think my intuition about this was right: I could've waited another forty years to see it.</fullReview>

Because I read such great reviews, I kept giving it "15 more minutes" to get better but it never did. I did not give a crap about the couples and I found the acting forced and contrived. That blonde girl was such an idiot - I could barely even watch her pretending to act drunk. The scene with the two guys under the tree was painful to watch - it looked like they were taking cues from a frat party as to what drunk guys should look like. Maybe it's because I do not drink, but I find watching drunk people air their insecurities as amusing and entertaining as watching grass grow.</fullReview>

You bet I'm scared of Virginia Wolfe, I'll run like hell the next time I see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This George and Martha Aren't First People ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bleak version of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"Elizabeth Taylor sacrificed her good looks to portray Martha, the unhappy wife of a college professor. Taylor shouts across the scream with a vengeance. Her depiction of the wife traumatized by the death of their only child is a remarkable one and she was awarded her second Oscar for it.Richard Burton received another losing Oscar nomination, this time as George, the college professor husband. He is vile and often tipsy. He cannot control the situation nor life either. George and Martha are really 2 bored individuals letting loose on life in general.George Segal and Sandy Dennis were both Oscar nominated for supporting awards for their performances as a young faculty member and his wife who realize their imperfections as well as they view George and Martha destroying each other. Definitely the best performance that Taylor gave in her long career. Dennis is amazing as a woman whose real problems surface once she hits the bottle. Taylor is dynamic as a screaming shrew Martha. Frustrated with life, she often comes across in a comic way as she torments George, the equally traumatized Richard Burton. All 4 leads received Oscar nominations. George Segal shows a depth that he earned the year before in "Ship of Fools." He was certainly on a roll after this film. Is this picture trying to depict small town life in a college, with its politics and tragedies? Interestingly, we never see Taylor's father, the head of the institution. Instead, we are shown four very unhappy people living out their frustrations in great detail. This picture may be viewed as a lost weekend redemption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I see what they were trying to do...but it's just too annoying in the process</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw all the acclaim regarding this film, particularly with Liz Taylor's performance and her winning a Best Actress Oscar for it. I've seen this premise before (can't remember where) and it was always fascinating; now I see where everyone else has gotten it from. I've seen a few Liz Taylor movies by now, and I could say without a doubt that this is her best performance ever. She really transformed into that character. WAOVW is a rare case in which the whole cast puts on powerhouse performances. I would've liked to see Richard Burton get an Oscar for his efforts here as well, he definitely deserved it and was neck and neck with Liz Taylor for the whole movie. I like what the makers were trying to accomplish with the story and all....but the whole thing just got annoying after a while; with all the yelling and fussing about nothings....it got tired pretty quickly and it just dragged on and on and on. I couldn't help but wonder why the hell Nick and Honey didn't just leave after being constantly berated and forced to witness the constant arguing and insanity. Also, I'm sure George &amp; Martha weren't the only ones living on that block, I'm suprised no one called the cops for all the yelling and chaos going on there in the dead of night. I somehow remember the play for this...and it seemed very weird that the characters left the house. If my memory serves me correctly this isn't how the original story goes down. The whole scene outside in the bar/on the street was very out of place and threw in a wrench in the pacing of the film. After a while no one knew if anything being said was even true, and by that point I feel its best that everyone just shut up and go their separate ways. I felt a great relief when the sun finally came up; as I knew the movie, and the torture of witnessing these terribly dysfunctional people go deeper and deeper into insanity, was finally going to end. I like the concept of WAOVW and saw what they were trying to accomplish (ultimately they did accomplish it) but it was just too annoying and repetitive for me to hail it as great.*** out of **** stars. (i'll give it *** stars for the concept, other than that its **1/2)</fullReview>

The only feelings I had for this film was to be in this film and beat everyone in the head with a baseball bat so they would shut up and leave each other alone. This film was so aggravating for me, sure the performances may be great, but the best thing to happen to these characters is to be killed on site and never to mingle with society again, ever.

		<fullReview>Watching this movie was a rather unique experience for me. I have never seen a movie that I disliked as much as this one contain two such wonderful performances as those of Burton and Taylor. Unfortunately, while they were both outstanding in their respective roles, this movie was very much a disappointment. I found it ridiculous that the young couple would share as much as they did with these two strangers on the first night they met. I also found it ridiculous that they didn't simply leave any number of times, when the behavior of their hosts bordered on the insane, with the time well in to the wee hours.O.K... George and Martha are complex, disturbed characters. Yeah... George is a disappointment to Martha and her father. Yes, George (it seems) killed his parents. And they created an imaginary child to help them "cope with the pain". All right, now which part of this was supposed to be of interest to me? None of it was, and that is the movie's failing. Wow, I learn that George Segal only married his wife because he thought she was pregnant, and, as it turns out, isn't really in love with her. Simply put - good movies make you care about the characters. I didn't care about these characters or anything they said or did. The movie went nowhere. After two plus hours, I am left with these two (maybe even four) well-developed characters, but a story that is an absolute bore. Different strokes for different folks. But to me - two out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incommodity of private life and solution for the pedagogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf ?" (1966) directed by Mike Nichols is being retroactively as a cult movie and anybody knows exactly why it is. What is at stake here is too some headed confrontation of testing capacities and skilled capabilities in quite frustration before the young generation of teachers, whose behavior facing abuse of drinking is free of taxation... It seems too that the couple of actors whose interpretation is done here was also responsible for a kind of fake mirror between private lives and the standard of an infamous couple of teachers, who also were the main characters in this fiction adapted from a well known play. In which the British literature legendary woman, by no means is subject of some misinterpretation if out of her own time living likewise mainly just before the First War of twentieth Century, when the suffragists were fighting for more rights for the women as woman beings with similar wins for society and civilization. The sex appeal of this woman is a leitmotiv of the good for selling in the way of patronized standards of feelings from uncomforted to irritability as alternative to the male concurrent in affects from the others. In a so close society of such a kind of speak easy, from uncommitted way of talking about flesh attraction, as degenerated furniture of eroticism knowledge at domicile. Like this circuit of teachers in a dramatic way, where she plays the wife of somebody whose main interest is charming the female that he has before him as aim of refraction of his self love affair and not his wife which he prefers not more less than such of the other married couple, for both it seems with their more young fellow colleagues at the drawing room illuminated by a night encounter at home. They are all intellectuals discussing if such a woman is true in her performance with a perfume of private scandal doing her better for diminishing her husband qualities for showing the inverse that he really taught as dramatist lecturer to the new generation whose capacity for understanding that way of regulating a marriage row is quite impotent, because this converge for rivalries between woman's rights to smoke or not for instance or to wear or not paints or trousers like the men. This is the course of next menopause before the time to Mrs.Albee, all right everybody smiling for her screaming and crying games, but enough is enough as lesson of cruelty and sensuality weeping for intercourse and bigamy out of physical delay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George and martha, Sad, sad, sad....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those not old enough to have seen this in it's premiere let me explain a few things.First, this was a huge hit in New York starring the incomprable Uta Hagan and Arthur Hill, in Los Angeles we got to see Nancy Kelly as the star, she was riding her success from the play The Bad Seed. Unfortunately we had to wait a few days to see her because President Kennedy was assassinated. When it was announced that Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton was to do a film version of this wonderful play needless to say we were a little disappointed. Sure, the Burton's were the most glamourous and bankable stars at that time but we wondered if Ms Taylor could play the part of a 50 year old woman. Later, we found that her character was suppose to be a younger woman and that started us thinking that Hollywood was going to tinker with one of our favorite plays. We went to the movie with a lot of misgivings and was pleasantly surprised at how close the screenplay was to it's original source, even to using some of the salty language. Richard Burton's approach was just right for the screen, he knew he had to save himself for the final third act. Ms Taylor did her best and deserved her Oscar for her performance, but I've always thought that the play demanded an older couple,for balance. After all, the contrast of Martha putting the make on that young man had a real meaning in the play while George's half hearted attempt at flirting with Honey worked on the stage. I have a copy of the movie but that's only because I love the dialog and as I said the film does retain some of the flavor of the great play. Richard Burton lost his Oscar bid to Paul Schofield who starred in the movie The Man for All Seasons but my vote really went to Mr Burton, he was the most believable character in the movie. All in all, I give the movie a six. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>when i read your reviews about how good this movie was... I went out and rented it right away... but when I saw it i found it just boring and exhausting while at least admiring the originality of it... but it wasn't enough to save it. The movie drags and doesn't reach a point.. this is especially true in the scene where the two husbands are talking outside, Damn was that boring... who cares about people laughing cause of a damn joke(he went on about it for 5 minutes) through all of the characters drunken rants it disconnects you from understanding their pain or being interested in any way and in fact just makes you never want to touch alcohol again! Elizabeth Taylor performance was great but the others really didn't act human at all instead it seemed forced. this is especially true with the blond wife.. if I want to see a movie about doomed relationships I'll stick to American Beauty.</fullReview>

All throughout the movie I asked myself why they behave that way, and why isn't the guest couple leaving!If I was the biologist invited to this party, I swear I would have left in less than 5 minutes.Summary: This movie sucked.

I am the boy, Damian, the omen or more affectionately known as the pale horse, the first test tube baby, born 7/11/66 in Philadelphia "the city of brotherly love", conceived at The University of Texas at Austin. Separated at birth from my not paternal but none the less brother, Nicholas Gates, who found me at Yamishiro in 1987, we were reunited briefly this past year, he works for Gustavo Santaolalla (ie Brokeback Mountain, ie bombs under the Kodak Theater at the last Academy Awards that no one knew about, while I was staying at the Hollywood Hills Hotel). Liz was driven mad by Richard Burton and his obsession with Equus, he hated her because of her love for Montgomery Clift, who was disappeared in 1966 not killed, like people were told. Anyway, Marta "Beckett" has cared for the horses at Amargosa for decades and I hope to get there soon. The name Damian, if you look it up, means "the tamer".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Broadway Version Was Brilliant - This Film Is Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Grace Kelly in "The Country Girl," one New York critic said that Miss Kelly's performance pleased only those who HADN'T seen the great Uta Hagen create the role on Broadway. Likewise, Elizabeth Taylor's performance as Martha was inept to say the least. Her timing, reactions, line delivery and facial expressions were all wrong for this part. Miss Hagen's notices were glowing, some of the best reviews bestowed on any actress in the history of the theater.I studied acting at the HB Studio in New York and spent several years acting on the NY stage. I feel that I can judge a so-so acting job from a great one. I saw the stage version, not with Miss Hagen, but with the marvelous Nancy Kelly as Martha. She had been Miss Hagen's understudy and also toured the USA in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" I also purchased the original Broadway cast album with Miss Hagen and Arthur Hill as "George," so I knew the dialog verbatim.As I sat in the movie theater watching Taylor and Burton, I was appalled. Both were unable to bring the utter FIRE that had dominated the original. Hagen is considered one of the first ladies of the American Theatre, and for GOOD REASON. She is among the Julie Harris, Eva LeGalliene, Helen Hayes, Gloria Foster, Rosemary Harris, Geraldine Page caliber actresses.Taylor gave a sneering, "movie acting" job as Martha, while Uta Hagen SAILED THE HEIGHTS OF GREAT ACTING (she easily won the Tony Award as best actress in a dramatic play). That part was the role of a lifetime, but, as usual, all Hollywood could think about was box office, not take the advantage to film the ORIGINAL CAST for posterity. This was the trend then as it is now. Think: Rosalind Russell in "Gypsy" instead of the milestone original performance by Miss Ethel Merman; Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady" instead of Julie Andrews; Mitzi Gaynor in "South Pacific" instead of Mary Martin (Doris Day was slated to do the film role, but the studio felt her salary request was too high, so they settled for Gaynor). It seems the only really smart transition from stage to film was Doris Day in "The Pajama Game," instead of the original, Janis Paige.To those reviewers here who praised Miss Taylor and Mr. Burton...if you can get your hands on the Columbia Records' Original Broadway Cast album, do. It's so incredible, you'll then KNOW you are witnessing the REAL "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?". Hagen and the rest of the original were THAT great. Sorry, Miss Taylor didn't have the acting chops to interpret such a powerful role as "Martha" and Richard Burton (usually a marvelous actor) was saddled with mediocre Taylor. Perhaps he might have pulled "George" off playing opposite a more competent actress. Taylor didn't do any better than the no-talent Kim Novak would have done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most overrated movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The talentless overacting ham Richard Burton just shouts his way through the entire film, just as he always did. Montgomery Clift was right, Burton couldn't act at all, he just recited the lines in that horrid gravelly chain smoker's voice. As if that were not bad enough he didn't even attempt an American accent, even though George was supposed to be an American. It was probably the worst casting ever. Taylor was clearly too young to play Martha, was she really given an undeserved Oscar just for looking fat? The film is far too long drawn out and boring and at the end of the day who cares about these stupid, pointless characters and their silly little lives. There's no way a highly educated character like the one played by George Segal would have put up with any of that nonsense.0/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is wrong with this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was credited with greatness I don't see where all this was. The plot was obvious from the very beginning the scenes were bland and boring and the use of black and white film with the attempt to bring darkness was a waste of time all this process did was to reveal the true nature of the actors. Who among us all does not have that destructive force within us. This was an easy performance for these people and they all just laughed it off after being praised by the masses and the film academy all to generate the money machine with the simple minded audience who seemed shocked by the release of this force that we apparently all have within us. This film does a few things that are not mentioned the first is the degradation of a man when a woman uses her feminine whiles to destroy. What has been a declaration of war since the garden of Eden they turn a simple minded but supposedly sharp witted man into a fool. The truth is he is a pimp who is to afraid to be a man I think he is meant to be a homosexual who is trapped. She is a little girl who has a hard time being a woman who never really became whole with child birth and has no value of herself so she is free to self destruct and take anybody with her so say I.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" is one of my 3 or 4 favorite plays. I think it is Albee's masterpiece (despite, or maybe because, it being so uncharacteristically realistic.) Because I love the play so, my attitude toward the film may have been twisted somewhat.However, I have always been very unsatisfied with this version. I believe that the Burtons were not the right people to play these parts -- at least not at the time they played them. Both Richard and Liz were international superstars, jet set glitteratti. Casting them then was like it would be casting J. Lo and Ben Affleck today. Regardless of whether they are good actors, their off-screen personas step into the screen with them and take over. You never really see Martha in this film without also seeing Elizabeth Taylor, and the same is true of Richard/George. You try to read one relationship into the other and it detracts from both.Plus, I've always felt that this version lost a LOT of the humor in the play. The lines are there, but the movie runs along at such a feverish pace that it's hard to enjoy the jokes. In fact, the humor and the change of pace that humorous segments bring are critically important to how the screenplay or play work. George and Martha are VERY scary people; not because they will really go after you but because in the battles at the center of their bizarre relationship they often set off explosions without regard to the collateral damage to others.The only thing that makes watching them do this tolerable is their intelligence and wit. They are both very sharp very clever people with finely honed comic sense. It is what keeps them sane. It's what keeps Honey and her hubby from leaving. It is what keeps George and Martha from being rejected entirely by the rest of the world. Yet, in the film, George feels more mousy than smart and Martha is played at such a high, harridan-like pitch, that it is almost impossible to see any other qualities in her. Moreover, "opening up" the play and sending them off to the bar always seemed a bad idea to me. I think that shifting the locale shifts the mood; we all know that a bad evening will get at least a little better if you move the venue. The play is carefully paced to build to the breaking point just before the end, when George and Martha confront a fiction they have lived for so many years. Talking anything away from building up the head of steam needed for this moment makes it much less believable.It would be an interesting film to see done today with a different and less "blockbuster" cast. I would love to see Susan Sarandon play Martha.</fullReview>

Even the acting is superb with Sir Richard and his wife Elizabeth. Why, then, does this movie fail? I think it must be the subject matter. There is no subject matter except a thinly veiled use of marriage conflict to string together the lines. Oscars were passed to actors, who were themselves passing out due to massive alcohol intake.
