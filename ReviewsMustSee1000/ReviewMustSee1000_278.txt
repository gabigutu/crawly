		<shortDescription>Sunshine - rather good..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine cost ?20 million. Jerry Bruckheimer and his Hollywood cohorts must be shaking their heads in disbelief. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland, British born and bred, have outdone America's effects laden finest, and at a mere fraction of the price. Armageddon ($140 million) and Pirates of The Caribbean 2 ($225 million) have nothing, nothing on the majestic visuals that Sunshine offers. From the jaw dropping opening sequence to the fantastically realised final moments, Boyle's latest is a mighty treat for the eyes. But of course, effects do not make a film. You need only consider the two aforementioned Bruckheimer blowouts for proof. But happily, behind the blinding visuals, Sunshine has a violently beating heart. One that offers absolutely no let up, that gains speed and then gains a little more, before finally threatening cardiac arrest. You can't help but live and breath every moment of the crew's breathless existence. The year is 2057 and a select group of astronauts are given that most trifling of tasks. The sun is dying. Drop a bomb in it. Save all of mankind. And to top it all, on a ship rather ominously named 'Icarus II'. Add inevitable inter crewmember tension and you have a rather heated situation. The sweaty crew are played wonderfully by a decidedly un-starry, but talented cast. Cilian Murphy, taking the lead role as the ship's resident physicist Cappa, the only member who has the wherewithal to actually drop the bomb, is coolly enigmatic as ever, the blue orbs of his eyes forming a nice counterpoint to the never far rather redder orb of the sun. You can't help but feel he isn't particularly challenged as an actor, but nevertheless he provides a suitably ambivalent, androgynous and faintly unsettling core to the proceedings. Perhaps more impressive is Chris Evans. Recently seen in a similarly hot headed role in the undercooked comic book adaptation 'Fantastic Four', he consistently snatches scenes from Murphy as engineer Mace, about as volatile and fiery as Cappa is composed and cool. Without Evan's energetic performance, the film would sink into an anti-libidinal quag. Mace's emotive instability injects pace when it's needed and brings some welcome variety to the otherwise glum faces. Evans is surely on the brink of big things. A small quibble would be that there are perhaps a few too many characters; meaning that a fair share of the cast never really gets a chance for development, which is irritating, as one gets the feeling that there's a lot of wasted potential.Another chink in Sunshine's spacesuit, is in many places, Alex Garland's screenplay. Whilst he has a remarkable talent for creating intense psychological tension, of which there is plenty in Sunshine, his philosophising is much less satisfactory. This is not to say he doesn't play with some fascinating ideas. With the crew circling so close to the Sun, to the giver of life, Garland begins ask the biggest of questions. Is there something, something inestimably greater than ourselves, something that could create such a magnificent star, or are we, like the sun, simply dust? It's a great idea, but for the larger part of the film, it seems oddly shoehorned into what is at base a sci-fi pot-boiler. In fact these ideas are better expressed in Boyle's imagery. Time and time again we see members of the crew staring aghast at the immensity of the burning ball of gas and dust in front of them. The relationship between giver and taker is better explored here than in any line of Garland's. The structure of his screenplay is also a little unwieldy. The first hour and a half play as an intense psychological study - the pace at times painfully weighty as the tension is ratcheted up ever higher. The film works beautifully here - it may not introduce anything particularly new; claustrophobic stress is certainly nothing new in sci-fi, but it follows genre conventions with such panache and artistry that it's difficult to fault. However, come the final 20 minutes, Sunshine takes a rather abrupt and unwelcome turn. A pretty hammy (not to mention poorly explained) plot twist is ushered in and suddenly we find ourselves in a horror film - a clichéd one at that. To say much more would spoil things, but needless to say, had the filmmakers showed a little restraint in the closing moments, they would have had a real classic on their hands. When the film ditches pretensions, and sticks with the clammy, slow burn thrills it excels at, it's fantastic. When it descends into predictable melodrama, it's still alright, it's just disappointing considering what we know it's capable of. As such it's remarkably well shot, superbly rendered, occasionally poignant and occasionally flawed. Whatever the case, Sunshine is never far from entirely thrilling, and, all said and done, film recommendations don't come much higher than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure many reviews will say something similar: This is two-thirds of a great sci-fi movie. Specifically, the first two thirds. Natural characters, intelligent dialogue, stunning visuals; I was thoroughly immersed in this philosophical disaster movie in space. Heck, even the moody, modern, sentimental score worked.The central premise concerns humanity's last hope for survival: the Icarus II (EXTREMELY dumb name for a ship travelling to the sun, if you remember the Greek legend), whose crew must re-ignite said star with a nuclear bomb the size of Manhattan island. It's distant future stuff, but the filmmakers work hard at establishing plausibility. They certainly achieve it. Impressive.Cast-wise, it's an eclectic group. Cillian Murphy gets the starring role, and he's good. Maybe it's just me, but he always looks slightly psychotic - something to do with the eyes perhaps? Anyway, he's a quirky and soulful leading man.Nice work by Michelle Yeoh, Rose Byrne and Cliff Curtis. Not one weak link in the multinational cast.I thought Chris Evans stole the acting honours. Despite his character's hot temper, he gave gravitas to every decision, and they included some pretty big ones. He's the pragmatic member of the group; logic's on his side, and he knows it.The introduction of Icarus I to the second half of the story (the previous ship that mysteriously failed) is not handled particularly well. The crew's decision to deviate from the mission is a poor one, and has disastrous consequences. Later on, a horror element is introduced which is just laughable. All the filmmakers' hard work peters out in a third act of blurry shots, shaky cams and incomprehensible cuts.Overall, 'Sunshine' is a real mixed bag. Director Danny Boyle and his cast work hard to create a believable scenario. The special effects really are special. I think the fault here lies with writer Garland, whose third act is derivative, contrived, and not worthy of the rest of this fine film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific study in sanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How would we cope under the most extreme circumstances imaginable? That is the question posed by Danny Boyle's latest offering, and the answer seems to be that anybody can be pushed over the edge, it is just a question of what and how much it takes.Danny Boyle seems unable to settle on a genre specialty, but it also seems that whatever he turns his hand to he can make work (with the exception of romantic comedy - A Life Less Ordinary anyone?). In his latest, the sun is dying, and we join the 2nd attempt to try and restart the star by delivering a nuclear bomb to kick-start it. Having been alone in space for the past 16 months, the eight-man crew is approaching its destination, but nerves are starting to fray. Then they pick up a signal rom the ship that made the first, unsuccessful, attempt. Inevitably they go and investigate, and problems ensue. When the inevitable disaster occurs, jeopardising the mission, we begin to see how people deal with extreme circumstances, and how their sanity is affected, in different ways. Elements are recognisable from Alien, Solaris and Event Horizon, and the film certainly benefits from all of those influences. The claustrophobia, the understated technology, the dark corridors, the unseen menace, all recognisable but effectively used.This is not a typical science fiction per se. There are no aliens, no space battles, and no ultra-advanced technology on show. Instead Boyle chooses a more philosophical tangent, leading to questions of exactly what defines humanity, and the value of a single life weighed against the future of mankind.The casting is excellent, with many recognisable but no particularly famous faces, the biggest names being Batman Begins' Cillian Murphy and Fantastic Four's Chris Evans. This lack of star names, combined with a cast of only the eight crew somehow makes the loneliness and the feeling of being a huge distance from home with a long way to go seem even more real. We really begin to feel with the crew as they try to hold it together long enough to complete their vital mission. Cillian Murphy in particular is a piece of inspired casting, as in many of his roles he has always appeared on the very brink of insanity anyway, so he has the close-to-crazy act down to a tee.The CGI of the sun is extremely impressive, particularly considering the relatively low budget of the film, and the simple but intense story has viewers on the edge of the seat virtually from first act to last. The suspense is built gradually but extremely effectively, to the extent where you can feel your sanity heading the way of the astronauts' as the conclusion approaches with increasing speed.Overall a very effective study in what a tenuous thing sanity is when faced with huge odds and a great threat. Thrilling, gripping and thought-provoking, and another genre nailed by Boyle - now if only he could crack that pesky rom-com!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A crew of eight tries to save mankind from freezing to death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very lucky being able to get into a preview of this movie today in Vienna. I only knew very little about it in advance, so my expectations were quite neutral.One word of advice: this movie is not for nitpickers or physicist. The plot outline (i.e. detonating a "stellar bomb" inside the sun) sounds ludicrous at first - but if you're able to ignore this and some other scientific nonsense, you get one great movie.This one is all about the details and the crew's behavior. Danny Boyle once again proves his insight into the human psyche as he portraits how the crew-members handle the various arising problems, some of the decision-making is displayed frighteningly realistic compared to other movies in the genre. Cillian Murphy (brilliant as ever) and Chris Evans (hated him in Fantastic 4, but showed a great performance here) pair up very nicely during most many scenes.The entire movie has a certain feel to it, the atmosphere is very tense and Boyle manages to keep the pace at quite a high level the entire time. Visual FX are at a high level as well.Apparently Sunshine can't deny the influences from 2001 or Event Horizon, nevertheless it should be treated as an independent film.A few deductions for some glitches and the scientific stuff, otherwise great entertainment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To say there is nothing new under the sun is usually apt in sunny Hollywood, but not this time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a suitably international and diverse cast to simulate the equivalent crew onboard the Icarus II ("Icarus I" didn't fare so well), director Danny Boyle fledges a science fiction that gains momentum at its very first image ? and does not halt until the end credits roll. To be perfectly frank, this is one of the most unbearably exciting films for whose entire duration I have ever squirmed in my seat for at the theatre.On a mission to re-ignite the sun by detonating a bomb ("the size of Manhattan island", Cillian Murphy's physicist nods to American audiences and cause me to suffer horrible flashbacks to Armaggeddon's "it's the size of Texas" assessment) human lives are expendable and rationalized by rank. There are scientists, astronauts and various specialists on Icarus II who are all poised on the brink of sacrificing themselves for the greater good of mankind. Diverse in the sense that there are both men and women, and few characters are 'black or white' (morally, and physically), it does puzzle me that New Zealanders, Aussies and Irishmen have been arbitrarily converted into Americans. The crew is nevertheless highly impressive and professional, with a few minor exceptions for plot-propelling purposes, like when someone does something very stupid.There is noticeably a tremendous visual sense throughout "Sunshine" with a screen that is awash with sparkling explosions and each frame saturated with bright colours and dimmed contrasts. There is no genre-transcending perhaps, and most probably its visuals are under the mercy of dating effects, but for now this is truly the cr?me de la cr?me of science fiction, take my word for it. Even the cinematography within the spaceship alleys and chambers is compelling and sweeps through Icarus II with great tracking shots. Amongst other films, Danny Boyle was inspired by Das Boot and certainly there are traces of the same claustrophobia underpinning the setting, but ultimately he opted for a more habitable environment to make it believable (like humanity would ship off its only hope with a crummy, crowded old vessel).To justify the occasional bouts of sci-fi clichés, I'd like to firstly point out that it's not like "Sunshine" traffics in stereotypes or resorts to formulaic elements, and secondly that I believe certain clichés have evolved for a reason ? they quite clearly stand the test of time. There are within science fiction some staples that are simply necessary to define its genre, such as the dutiful human sacrifices to up the drama, the internal mutinies to instill the uncertainty in the operation, the nightmarish conditions onboard the ship to suck you in, the technical jargon of velocities and shield angles that spits like bullet-fire to give the film a firm scientific footing, and finally the epic music to elevate suspense. "Sunshine" incorporates and melts together all of the aforementioned, but in militantly non-formulaic ways that only add to the experience. As a potent example, there isn't just pedestrian classical tunes recycled from 2001 and filtered through {insert rote Hollywood composer here}'s score ? it is puffed full of beautiful piano crescendos that are almost incongruous to the sci-fi vibe, and the cumulative effect is wonderful."Sunshine" is sporadically blemished by minor faults, such as when Murphy's Law is being followed a bit too rigorously to up the excitement. Luckily, all of this is washed away or camouflaged when Boyle serves up his next goosebumps-inducing, gasp-eliciting spectacle ? be it a horror twist or an impossibly epic action stunt. On the topic of the former, and clearly the chiasma at which "Alien" comparisons have been drawn, there is a magnificently creepy horror/mystery vibe interlacing the story in space. On top of this, Danny Boyle also dabbles in existentialism (a little too much if you ask me), making this into one of the most ambitious sci-fi turns ever made. In this way, maybe "Sunshine" is not primed to collect awards or even serve as meat for mainstream Hollywood, but I think it's safe to crown it the "Alien" of the 21st century.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I couldn't find the "off" switch for my brain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two things up front: Firstly, anyone who's read this far into the reviews knows the plot of this thing (astronauts chucking a bomb-- if not themselves-- into the dying sun in order to revive it). Secondly, the following is as disjointed as the film it addresses.So many glowing reviews I've read for "Sunshine" seem to center around the idea that one must simply give in to the power and majesty of the film's visuals. That is to say, one must in the presence of "Sunshine" emphasize oohing and ahhing over thinking.I'm sorry: I can't do that. Ironically, if "Sunshine" were being touted as a dumb bit of fluff, I'd be far more likely to take it at face value. But "Sunshine"'s makers and culties have trumpeted their darling as a slice of intelligent sci-fi, oh-so-rare these days, etc.Frankly, it's not. That "intelligent" thing. Not a bit of it.Thoughts: If you hire a physicist to act as a consultant on your film, and if your screenwriter concocts backstories for your characters, and if you house your actors in bare-bones student digs and send them up in airplanes that permit them to experience zero-g, all so that they feel like "real" astronauts, and if all that consulting and all those stories and all that experience don't end up on the screen-- i.e., if you expect us viewers to mine the film's websites for this science and these tales-- then you as a filmmaker (that means you, Mr. Boyle) haven't done your job. Simple.We don't know who these characters are, so we don't care about them. Sure, Rose Byrne has her teary brown doe-eyes, so she captures an instant sympathy vote, and Hiroyuki Sanada draws us in with his calm and his silky voice. But the rest of 'em? Cillian Murphy comes off as a stoner and a bit of a jerk, and Chris Evans tries desperately to make something of the "duty" card he's been dealt, but the rest of 'em are ciphers. Alex Garland seems to think that character development is for sissies-- or that it's certainly not important if you have a Big Idea (here "Our Lives Are Secondary to the Saving of All Humanity, Dontchaknow"). I politely suggest that he's dead wrong. If we don't give a rat's patootie about the characters, we certainly won't care about the idea in the service of which they're acting.And not only are they ciphers: they're inconsistent, too. Early on, Mace goads Capa, the only one capable of operating the stellar bomb (in itself a ridiculous idea: what, in sixteen months, Capa couldn't train a backup to turn the key and press the "LAUNCH" button? Job security, I guess.), into performing a highly dangerous repair job outside the ship. Then, later, when he and Capa and another of the Icarus II's hapless crew must execute an ill-advised human-cannon trick between two crippled airlocks (a situation that falls squarely between "Don't ask." and "What the hell?"), Mace insists that Capa take the only available spacesuit, as he's indispensable to the mission. Sure, Mace earlier may have been feeling piqued and petty, Capa having pulled a bit of a careless dumb with regard to their window for sending messages home, but the fact here is that it's not my job to make Mace's excuses. It's Mr. Garland's job, and his script simply doesn't deliver.Don't try to cover up the paper-thinness of your story by snowing us with special effects. It's insulting and annoying. Just how many useless beauty shots of the Icarus II does this movie contain, anyway? Not one of them helps us to know where we are on the ship. Also: if you can't afford the effects you wanted for your third-act mad slasher (did I already mention the "Don't ask." thing?), don't try to cover by shaking the camera and overexposing your shots every time said slasher is on screen. That takes "annoying" clear up to "blatantly irritating."Smart people creating jeopardy by making dumb choices or nonsensically arbitrary decisions is less likely to evoke sympathy than smart people who find themselves in peril because of natural disasters or mechanical catastrophes. That is, a supposedly smart guy who makes a calculation that leads to half a spaceship going up in flames is less likely to earn a "You poor people!" from me than, say, a freak solar flare that leads to half of said spaceship going up in flames. And have I mentioned yet how much I despise selectively "smart" computers? As in, a computer that talks to you and calls you by name and yet can't tell you when half your spaceship has just caught on fire? (Not that it's entirely the computer's fault here, the fire thing: it happens during one of "Sunshine"'s many randomly placed beauty shots, so it's quite likely that the computer, like the viewing audience, isn't sure if the ship that catches fire is actually the Icarus II, the ship on which Our Story is taking place. "Oh, look: there's a ship on fire over there. Hey-- do you smell smoke...?")Selective flammability: Not only do Capa and the film's Mystery Slasher not burn up when Capa, hoping to effect a desperate getaway, yells "Full sunlight!" in the observation lounge of the Icarus II, the lounge itself doesn't burn up. By comparison, when the show's nutter psychologist (again: don't ask) tries the "full sunlight" thing, he burns up just fine, thank you.So: who gets the star? It's a split: Chris Evans, who tries so desperately to be the voice of reason (if only for a moment) on this ship of fools, and Underworld and John Murphy, who were obviously watching a much more intelligent, moving, and dramatic film when they concocted the score.Even though it's rare to see a movie so lovingly misconceived, you'd be wise to give this a miss. Dumb, depressing, muddled, and thoroughly unentertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misfired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming from the director-writer team that brought us the imaginative, creative "28 days later", "Sunshine" is a disappointment. It's as if the movie makers, halfway through making the movie, got hit by some mysterious radiation or virus and abruptly changed their mind, turning a space epic adventure with promising potentials into a space horror B-movie. Permit me to elaborate.I like the cut-and-dry, no nonsense opening, when we see the crew of eight, after 16 months in space, arrives a week ahead of schedule at the edge of the "dead zone" from which communication with Earth is no longer possible. Their mission is to re-ignite a dying sun with an explosion, something that the previous mission 7 years ago failed to do. In similar movies, there is invariably a build-up showing the background, the assembling of the team, establishing characters and conflicts, and so on. Doing away with all these preliminaries in "Sunshine" is a courageous thing in itself, showing the movie makers' confidence that whatever they put on the screen will be spellbound for the audience. For a moment, they seem to be right.There are one or two interesting parameters. No pain has been spared in driving the point home that the Sun, while the source of all lives on Earth, is at the same time the deadliest of enemies, particularly at close range. And yet the fascination it has on the crew (especially two of them) is almost hypnotizing. This theme has been consistently reinforced throughout the movie. There is also careful depiction of the psychological impact of prolonged isolation on some of the crew members.The key turning point of the plot is the discovery of the vehicle lost 7 years ago and the decision to make a detour, not to check for survivors, but to collect the unused bomb so that the mission will have two chances instead of just one. So far so good. Mishaps happen along the way, naturally. In this genre, the audience in prepared to accept a certain degree of weak logic. But as incredulity develops to mind-boggling proportions you begin to lose interest. For example, how can you believe that an expert who carefully calculates every detail of the mechanism for changing the course forgets to take into consideration the effect of the deadly Sun, something that is more critical and fundamental to their survival than water and food? But all these mounting plot holes are dwarfed by the complete shift of the movie from a save-the-Earth mission to a space horror. Even worse, this is not a space horror that is firmly rooted, such as "Alien". The plot twist in "Sunshine", despite the elaborate packaging, is a sloppy devise of four words: one guy gone crazy.The characters in "Sunshine" stand out neither more nor less compared with those in movies such as "Armageddon", "Deep Impact", "Core", "Mission to Mar" or other ones you might think of. Cillian Murphy is completely wasted here. He gets a better deal even in "Red Eye".On the technical plane, this movie is not bad. Images, sound, editing, score all contribute towards the creation of an atmosphere of tension. You would like to put aside your reasoning capacity and enjoy it. But when your tolerance is stretched to a breaking point, this movie become memorable, for the wrong reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danny Boyle successfully reignites the sci-fi genre!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reanimating the zombie genre with 28 Days Later, director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland now turn their attention towards science fiction - with equally startling results.Sunshine is unequivocally the best sci-fi movie in a very, very long time. I'd echo the other comments on here - it mixes elements of 2001: A Space Oddessy with Event Horizon, then adds the tension of Alien. This is NOT the gung-ho action of Armageddon, The Core et al.The film just throws you straight into the space mission, there's no background to worry about, only these 8 crew members headed towards the sun. The great thing about this cast is that there's no "superstar" billing, so you're never sure who is going to make it alive to the end of the film! The actors are uniformly good, with Chris Evans in particular deserving much praise. Michelle Yeoh delivers a very understated performance, very different from her ass-kicking Asian roles! Danny Boyle has always been good with characters but with Sunshine he really steps up a level. Visually this film is astonishing and literally had me open mouthed at times. The production design, costumes, the sound design, the music from Underworld... they all combine to give the viewer an amazing cinematic experience that you'll want to watch for a second time, just to take it all in.Whilst it's an exciting, tense film to watch there's no denying the serious point of Sunshine's message. It's a film about preserving the future of mankind and the sacrifices that have to be made in order to do that... and it will make you think long after the credits have rolled.A fantastic achievement - one which deserves to be seen on the big screen when it opens worldwide. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The spotted mind of the eternal Sunshine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The combination of director Danny Boyle, writer Alex Garland and actor Cillian Murphy should have meant that Sunshine was the best film of the year so far. Sadly it's meaningless drivel.There are two kinds of space movie. The first are those with shooting and/or aliens (Star Wars, Serenity, Alien etc). Then there are those in which the focus of the film is on people going mad in space for no well explained reason (Solaris, 2001, Silent Running etc). Sunshine falls into the latter category. If you've knowingly seen a Tarkofsky film then go and see Sunshine - you're bound to be able to find some spurious justification for why it was meaningful.*Spoiler*A group of ethnically diverse astronauts are in the final leg of the second and last mission to chuck a cosmic paint can into the sun in an attempt to "restart" it. Nothing much happens until the crew discovers that the ship from the first mission is still orbiting the sun. The crew then decide that they'd rather be in "Alien" than "Solaris" and go to investigate. Naturally someone is still alive on the original spaceship. This surviving loony has a god-complex, a bad case of sunburn and the ability to blur film. He kills everyone except Cillian Murphy who manages to detonate the bomb and everyone on earth is saved - hooray.Apparently: 1) Sentient super computers aren't very good at providing useful information such as "there's an extra person on board" or "shall we make sure the mirrors are adjusted before turning the ship?". 2) Vitally irreplaceable sections of space ships often explode and/or catch fire for no reason. Providing backup systems (or even fire extinguishers) is apparently pointless and unnecessary. 3) Computers that rely on complex liquid cooling devices to function do not require emergency shut offs. Or spares. 4) Gold lame space suits are in. 5) All derelict space ships should be investigated in case they contain plot devices. 6) If the sun is going out restarting it will be a doddle.*End Spoiler*There are some people who may decide this is THE in thing. Me, I'd rather watch Space Truckers again... and that's saying something. I'd give it some points for the special effects but really, given that none of them serve the story in any useful way, I cannot even justify that. 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a sci-fi fan. I've seen a few sci-fi films, but I don't flock to the nearest cinema to check them out. The only one I own on DVD is Alien vs. Predator, and that's only because it was three bucks at the video store and I needed a fifth one. I haven't seen 2001 or Event Horizon, and I don't remember anything about Alien. I saw Armageddon in 1998, when I was eleven years old, and I just remember being embarrassed at that scene with the animal crackers.That being said, this film may have turned me into one of the sci-fi fans. If nothing else?if seeing a film that explores more than just "action" on screen isn't your kind of thing?the film is gorgeous. The shots of the sun are some of the most fascinating bits of effects I have ever seen in any sort of film, not only sci-fi. The film is set only fifty years into the future, and therefore the technological aspects of the set are relatable rather than hard to imagine.The characters are well developed, and the actors are top-notch. Every single performance is phenomenal, and I was even a bit taken aback by how much I enjoyed Chris Evans's portrayal of Mace. Everyone seems to have taken the time to learn about the science and about the psychological factors of being with the same people for so long (most likely due to the fact that Danny Boyle sort of forced them to), and it shows on screen. The characters are all real, and although none of us know what it would be like to be in space and alone for sixteen months, there are aspects of them all that are immediately relatable.The plot is secondary. That doesn't mean that it isn't well thought or anything like that, but the human drama and psychological journey of the characters is the primary concern in the film, and the fact that they are going to re-ignite the sun is merely the background story that puts them all together in the first place. There are far more triggers that ask the audience to think about their life and the life of mankind and of the universe itself than there are for the audience to question, "Well, how did that just happen?" The film asks us to have a brain and be willing to use it.Sunshine is a religious experience. It is very personal and is a very unique experience to each member of the audience. It is incredible, awe-inspiring, intense, and one of the most beautiful pieces of film I have ever seen. Danny Boyle, Alex Garland and Andrew Macdonald have done it again. A+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I realized who directed this one, I thought, "Oh, no - not Danny Boyle!" but since I totally LOVE science fiction, I ordered the DVD and thought: "Mr Boyle, surprise me!" And surprise me he did.This is without doubt the best science fiction movie in a very long time. Visually, this one is a gem. I don't think I have seen such beauty in the Sun ever. The "Icarus II" interiors and exterior is truly wonderful and looks so very real. The actors do a great job realizing a surprisingly good script.The story is a blend of many science fiction movies, but more on the paying tribute to what was than stealing. You have for instance the resemblance of "Discovery One" in "2001: A Space Odyssey", and a couple of other scenes from there. Watch both movies and you will get my point. Several other movies also have "guest appearances".Expect state of the art special effects, expect an excellent script - and expect wonderful acting.I'm not only surprised - I am also very much impressed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, us "fools" will compare Sunshine to Event Horizon, because finally there's a sci-fi movie with an even worse ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghastly.The first two thirds of Sunshine were fair. Nothing great, but fair. There were immediate problems from the very beginning (such as using a calm voice when it should be awed, and the exact opposite as regards the music), but I liked the fact that none of the crew members were either particularly heroic or evil, but just ordinary people. But I certainly sat there wondering where the hell this story was going. Then came the last part, and, as is the case with so many bad movies, it went straight to hell in a hand-basket. Throughout the movie the logic between events were unclear. Where were we? How did we get from one situation to the next? How did this or that bit work? There was an abject lack of explanations for a host of things, from what exactly was wrong with the sun, and to just what it was that caused the Earthroom fire.But it can be argued that these elements are not important, because the producers were trying for an art movie. So the substance is all in the themes: World is doomed; scientists are trying to save it; insane religious fanaticism is sabotaging science. Also the scene where they vote on whether to kill Trey: Cassie is the conscience; the emotional and irrational heart among all the rational analyses. Sure. Nice themes. But utilized inside the confines of an utterly incompetently structured narrative.Nothing made sense. For instance, I could write several pages on the zany way this movie treated gravity. And how it tried to get by on clichés. And was unsuccessful in building suspense due to sloppy writing, directing, editing and sound effects. The creators of this movie know very little about science fiction, and they should stick to what they do marginally well: horror.Sunshine was a failure, and its IMDb rating (currently a staggering 7.8!!) will plummet when more people (such as actual SF fans, and people who're not friends of the director) see it. Halfway through it I thought it might merit a 5 rating, but the ending was so ludicrous, unbelievable and stupidly put together that I can only end up awarding the movie a 2 out of 10. I now believe this movie has the worst ending of any sci-fi movie I have ever seen. Event Horizon, move over!Sheeze.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunshine brightens careers and minds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film twice. Both viewings left me with an entirely new experience. This is what I admire about the talented duo of Danny Boyle and Alex Garland. They both envision an entertainment encounter enhanced by a subversive message regarding human issues of today. As an intelligent film, Sunshine provides a slate of questions, which are answered by you, the viewer. There is no wrong way to view this film. It acts like a self-portrait, where the film becomes the paint and you become the painter.The plot follows a crew of eight scientists/astronauts who set out on an epic mission towards the Sun, a star which is dying due to internal deterioration by a "Q Ball" (see http://www.sunshinedna.com/?p=236). On their ship, Icarus II, they carry a Stellar Bomb, which is mastered by the physicist Capa (Cillian Murphy). After they reach Mercury, a transmission is heard from the first spaceship that failed the mission. From there, the action begins. The CGI was impressive, especially the reflective solar panels on the spaceship. The Sun is a spectacular sight to see. Its magnificence and peril are certainly shown in the film. Despite this, the CGI is not overpowering. The complexity of the characters parallel (if not exceed) the well-done special effects.Since Sunshine features an ensemble cast, it is really hard to point out only one actor who succeeded among the rest. All of them ? well-known and not ? portrayed their characters to the fullest and brought their best talents to the big screen. Murphy did a fantastic acting performance as Capa. Scientific jargon was not at all a problem with this character. He made you believe Capa's expertise in physics as well as his lack of it as a non-career astronaut. Another standout performance resonates from the beautiful actress, Rose Byrne. Her emotional dynamic is tested in this project and she pulls it off to an uncommon level. Do not be swayed by her looks alone. If her previous film Troy did not catapult her into the public eye, Sunshine will no doubt brighten her Hollywood status. If you plan on refusing Sunshine because of Chris Evans, you will severely regret it. Although typecast as a comedy actor, he truly shines as quite the opposite in this film. Not only does he captivate the audience with his hothead, apathetic persona as the engineer Mace, he sets himself apart from his popular film characters, like Johnny Storm in Fantastic Four. As to be expected in thrilling horror films, Evans also contributes mild comedic relief in various places to lighten up the wave of high tension Sunshine offers. In the end, Mace's redeeming quality puts him outside the realm of antagonist.Murphy, Byrne and Evans were the only actors who I knew fairly well beforehand. However, after being a webmistress of a Sunshine fansite (http://sunshine.e-fan.org) and watching the film twice, I became a fan of everyone. Michelle Yeoh is an international sensation and her performance in Sunshine leaves me breathless every time. She plays the biologist Corazon and her passion toward the Oxygen Garden and living plants is apparent in everything Yeoh does ? especially the deep emotion expressed in her eyes and voice. Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada is by far one of the best selections in the Sunshine cast. His role as Captain Kaneda is complimented by Sanada's natural dominating and respected presence on screen. Kaneda's impact on the film is pivotal and memorable throughout. Out of the entire cast, Benedict Wong, Cliff Curtis and Troy Garity are perhaps the least known. The lovely Benedict "Benny" Wong deserves much better recognition than he has had in the past. He was said to have acted too intensely in one scene. If you have seen Sunshine, you will realize how meaningful that statement is and the level at which Wong performs. New Zealander Cliff Curtis plays the doctor Searle. As Searle, Curtis introduces one of the main points embedded in the film and becomes a solid player in the ideological arena. The communications officer Harvey, Troy Garity's character, can be misunderstood if you have not read the character backstories (see http://www.sunshinedna.com/?p=247). Garity successfully captures his essence to the say the least.Sunshine is not supposed to intimidate you into believing anything nor did I leave the theater feeling that way. It is simply a film that expanded the thrills and excitement of a science fiction piece to a powerful human drama. If you would rather not inspect its deeper implications, you can still appreciate Sunshine for its fictitious and pleasurable value. The action and emotion flooding the film keeps you on the edge of your seat. Who will survive? Will they complete the mission? Watch it and be amazed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Impressive, Boyle conquers another genre!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Boyle has rebooted the sci-fi genre to a magnificent start. "Sunshine", clearly inspired by the classics "Alien", "2001: A Space Odyssey" and many more, but brought to the modern age.The plot sounds ridiculous at first, but once you get into it, you really get into it! A crew of 8 are sent on a mission to set a bomb in the sun as it is dying and the earth is suffering a solar winter. 7 years before that there was a similar mission, but that failed. They find the lost spacecraft and decide to board it, but a fatal incident occurred that lost them their oxygen supply. There is no longer enough for all of them to get back to earth alive. But there is enough for few; so who will take the plunge and who will survive? And will their sanities stay intact to last them the epic journey? With such a small cast there was surprisingly no weak performances. Everyone had the desired screen-time to be able to care for them. But the characters anger and frustration caught up with them after being on the ship for 16 months, they begin to take acts of violence on each other and feel stressed so they forget vital aspects that could cost them their lives. You have to remember that they will save mankind if their mission is a success; that's a lot of pressure. And the film feels like a lot of pressure due to the intenseness it creates.Boyle's skills to create tension is impressive. He uses special techniques to make us feel claustrophobic and more importantly, to panic. Close ups, angles, blurs, stretches, stops, flashes all add up to the effect. The effect of feeling the heat. It burns. But in between those scenes you get to see the relaxing side of space. The view from outside. Its beautiful, truly dazzling and spectacular.The score is incredible. During the beginning its like a calm 'breather'. But then its turns into a beat. A fast beat. And your heart joins it. Pumping away to make you feel more insecure. Very intense.Boyle really proves he has talent for different genres in this modern sci-fi to be classic showing how people do the most inhumane thing to survive. I highly recommend it. Rewatches over the years have revealed its flaws and clichés but it's still enjoyable and nostalgic for me.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be fair for a short while I was quite taken with the sheer atmosphere of Sunshine. The ship, the location, the effects. Breathtaking.Still, it didn't take long for them to mess it up. Here they go again... The wheels started to fall off about the time the crew start having a brawl. I'm thinking, maybe the selection process should have focused a bit more on the maturity of the people saving the human race? Responsibility and all that.The story continues and we have a major catastrophe and the shield is damaged as a result of a human memory malfunction. Two observations:1. We have an intelligent (?) computer that will override their vital mission to fix the shield in a vital, life threatening way but it wouldn't bl**dy well make the one point something angle correction to the shield when they changed course in the first place! (Which thus also endangered the mission) Since when do we let computers make judgment calls? Why didn't they again use their codes to override the computer for the mere 30 seconds or so it would take to save the Captains life?2. There was a huge, inconvenient fire in the oxygen producing compartment. Now the computer tells the crew many useful things but did it mention there is a fire? Nope. Was there an effective way to deal with this risk? Again no. Unless you consider burning the oxygen you need to survive effective..... I might mention here that the implication is that the trees have created so much pure oxygen that the fire is particularly violent. Um, surely you have been feeding the trees CO2 or basically the same air everyone is breathing?Moving on...We have the space jump from the Icarus 1. Some guy, we really don't care who, ends up in the absolute cold of space behind the shield. Absolute cold of space being -273 degrees Kelvin we're told, so pretty rapidly he freezes. Now that's tough I guess but it's even worse, it's just wrong.If we assume there is no radiant heat coming from the shield itself here's the story. Space is a vacuum, a vacuum is nothing, so it is neither hot or cold. If, there is no radiant heat source present, then an object will radiate it's heat without gaining any in return until it's all gone. This occurs at absolute zero which is -273 degrees Kelvin. Good so far.The reason freezing instantly is rubbish is because the writers haven't realized that there is no heat loss by conduction (as in air) but only by radiation. This can be a very slow process. Which is why we put hot drinks in a vacuum flask to keep it hot, a vacuum is the best insulator. Basically freezing would be the least of your worries in space without a suit.A few more minor points too sharp to swallow- The shield has lots of moving parts, that don't appear to be useful... - If the plan all along was for the shield-bomb unit to fly into the heart of the Sun, what was going to protect the spacecraft on the return journey? What was going to protect the bomb when it entered the Sun and the heat could come from behind? - Why can you simply raise the, absolutely vital, mainframe computer out of it's coolant without any safety devices or alarms going off? (To override a mission saving action by the computer you need two people and security codes...) Once you raise it, although it turns off, in a while it will destroy itself, somehow. To service it the best way is to dive into freezing water and use a....spanner. The system that raises and lowers it has enough grunt to trap and maim a human being. - When the computer goes off the lights go out, there are no emergency lights... - You can ask the computer to allow so much heat and light in that it will kill you.

		<fullReview>I'm wondering, first of all and a little queasily, what, in ten or twenty years, will be the movie that makes "Sunshine" seem smart and entertaining. After sitting in a combination of slack-jawed shock and sheer blistering irritation through this latest and most misguided effort from wonderboys Boyle and Garland, a viewing pal and I dug out "Event Horizon" and "Supernova" (the latter henceforth to be known as "Mace Is Pinbacker, and There Be Boobies, Too"). And, guess what? The two that once seemed chunks of rankest Velveeta now blossomed like the sweetest of Edams next to "Sunshine." Call me old-fashioned, but I like films to be entertaining. I like them to have plots that progress with a semblance of logic. Oh, and I like films that have characters. With character. "Event Horizon" and "Supernova" at least take a shot at those criteria. "Sunshine" places itself above such silliness. Oh, Mr. Garland, what were you thinking...? (After the third draft, let alone the thirty-fourth, you should by now know enough to say to yourself, "This isn't working, is it?") Mr. Boyle: What possessed you to want to film this script...? And all of you in the cast: How high was the bar tab when you signed on the dotted line...? So many reviewers have singed this thing already that I'll focus on a few idiosyncratic annoyances and have done.We're told-- and shown-- throughout "Sunshine" that the sun will burn you to a crisp in less time than it takes to think the phrase "bug zapper," and yet at the end Cillian Murphy's scientist-hippie-savant Capa stands face-to-face with a roiling wall of solar plasma without so much as a blister on his milk-white skin. Of course, earlier he mumbles something about the laws of physics not applying within the sun itself, and I guess he's the expert so he ought to know, but I can't help but wonder silly things like how the sun can burn right through the wall of the bomb housing (which bomb, for some reason, requires a crew of nuts to run it right up to the sun-- I guess there's a real danger of missing a target as tiny as Old Sol) without burning right on through him, too. It burns through him eventually, sure, but not before we're treated to the Obligatory Poetic Destiny Moment. Earlier in the show, another character roars in agony as he roasts alive in direct sunlight; here, now, in the Land of the Big Finale, Capa gets to look all wondering and angelic as the solar breeze flutters his flowing locks. It's as if Danny Boyle took the afternoon off (given the sloppy direction throughout the film, a month or two off wouldn't have been out of line) and flagged Steven Spielberg-- in full golden-glowy schlock mode-- to stand in for him.Another random ranting: Even though the film's makers and supporters yodel to all and sundry about how their marvelous picture-show manages to get by without any aliens or supernatural elements, "Sunshine"'s third-act mystery killer is not only super-duper strong (okay: so maybe toting the admittedly, erm, fine-boned Cillian Murphy around by the throat would realistically call only for "reasonably strong," no "super" or "duper" about it), he's completely immune to wild extremes of heat and cold. He takes a blast of "full sunlight" (the same brand of "full sunlight" that incinerates at least two other characters) without so much as an "Ouch!"; then he removes from their silly huge open vat of cooling liquid the ship's preposterously big computer components and suffers not the least touch of frostbite-- even though frostbite fatally mauls the poor schmuck saddled with the task of re-dunking those components.About halfway through, I started thinking how much fun Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright would have making a parody of "Sunshine." By the end, however, I'd modified the thought in two ways: 1. the Pegg parody would have a beginning, a middle, and an end; action one could follow; and warmth, humor, and heart-- all of which "Sunshine" lacks in spades; and 2. the parody had already begun. Maybe it was a pre-emptive strike on the part of Boyle and Garland, but by the time they were milking for drama the fact that Mr. Murphy had fallen in his spacesuit (note to Mr. Boyle: don't EVER admit that you based a spacesuit design on Kenny from "South Park." Trust me on this.) and-- yes!-- couldn't get up, I burst out laughing. Oh, he's grunting-- he's sweating-- he's making that deeply endearing "Nnnnnnnggghhh--!" sound that signals to fluttery fan-ears and -hearts worldwide that He, Cillian Murphy, Is In Distress-- and it's one of the most cracker-jack funny film moments I've seen in months. Which months in fact included a Pegg parody, "Hot Fuzz." Perhaps Boyle and Garland should hearken to a new calling.'Cause sci-fi certainly isn't their strong suit. Come to think of it, neither is character development. Or pacing. Or middles. Or endings. Or....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything I thought it would be. Pity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the cinema with mixed expectations. The premise - a team of scientists sent with a giant bomb to return our dying sun to normal levels - seemed B-movie material of the worst kind. I could just imagine card-board cut-out characters, clichéd plot twists and a truck of scientific errors. Yet this is directed by Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, 28 Days Later) so who knew, maybe he could work the same magic he did on zombie flicks on the disaster-in-space sub-genre. I am surprised to report Sunshine delivered on all of these points.Cillian Murphy, star of 28 Days Later, returns as ship's primary physicist, Capa. He and the rest of the 8 crew members of Manhattan-sized bomb Icarus II are on a mission to fix the Sun, which is cooling perilously. 16 months in and something forces a change of plan. The previous (failed) expedition is discovered floating in orbit of our star. It's when Capa makes the decision that they change course for the Icarus I that things start going wrong. One small mistake leads to great danger, which causes more havoc and forces the desperate saviours of humanity to take even more dangerous risks and so on, all culminating in an insane and murderous survivor rampaging through the ship with a motorised scalpel.Up until actually reaching the Icarus I, it's all so Apollo 13 and so good. Spot-on characterisation, beautiful long shots and rather familiar set design (watch out for the cockpit). But it's when Sunshine tries to be a psychological-thriller and a sci-fi and a horror flick and an action movie that it all starts to go horribly wrong as a film. It loses direction - maybe because Danny Boyle is too busy looking over the computer graphics guys' shoulders and saying "Ooh, that looks cool. Hey, how about we obscure half the action? Or put in pseudo-subliminal images? Or blur the screen?Orstoptheframe? Addsomeghostingthere!Andthere!Andblurthis! Andputaflashoflightthere!" Individually, each graphic trick that Boyle tries looks really, really cool and usually flows properly but when he throws them into the movie like Picasso throws paint, it gets very tiring awfully quickly. Quite frankly, it gives me a headache even to remember it.What plot is full of holes, too. Some may actually have been explained but I must have blinked during those frames. For example, and worst by far, is that they seem to ignore the effect of the Sun's gravity for the most part. If an object is thrust parallel with the spin of the Sun, gravity should pull them towards it in a curve but instead they travel in a totally straight line. Bah.It's such a shame that Sunshine ends up so incomprehensible and random because it is packed full of good ideas. It's apparent that they tried to do too much at once and weren't critical enough to get rid of the stuff that was un-necessary or didn't work. Still, the 'lesser of two evils' theme running through certainly makes food for thought. It's refreshing to see such sensible characters who know what's at stake. Would you kill a friend to save humanity and all the solar system? What about three friends? More? That's the question isn't it...I can't recommend watching this film. It's smart, it's oh so beautiful, it's well acted... but it has collapsed under its own weight into nothing more than sun-scorched stardust. Go watch Pitch Black, or dig out that old VHS of Apollo 13, Alien or the Abyss. Anything. Just not this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very well thought out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high expectations for this film, as the scenario is an interesting one. Unfortunately, the film is clumsily structured and incoherent in parts, and many elements are contrived to keep the crew in danger. Here's a not quite comprehensive list: - The movie opens with a voice-over explaining the situation and you jump right into the ship. Since there's no shots showing what is actually happening on Earth until the very end, I didn't feel invested in the mission. - Any science that was once in the script has been gutted here - there's no mention of WHY the sun is dying or exactly how the bomb will restart it, although an interesting theory about a "Q-particle" infesting the sun is on the production blog.- You'll be confused by some of the most incoherent fight scenes ever filmed. With his extreme closeups and quick cuts, Boyle can't even pull off a 20 second fight in a corridor without losing the audience. It gets worse with the Pinbacker character, who's filmed so blurry and artsy that my wife seriously thought he was some kind of trans-dimensional alien.- For such a critical mission, the Icarus ships are not very robust. They contain only one airlock (even the shuttle has two ways to get out!), one mainframe that depends on a constant supply of coolant with no backup computer, and no emergency lighting. Instead of the habitat spinning to provide gravity (which would make more sense than the never-mentioned but apparent artificial gravity), the only part of the ship that spins are the communication antennas - the one part you want stationary and pointing to Earth. The heat shield is composed of thousands of mechanical louvers with no imaginable function, instead of a simple solid piece. I rarely had a clear idea as to where anything was in this ship; for example, the viewing room was cut into the bomb's heat shield, but there was no impression that anyone had to walk through the bomb area to get there.- Oxygen levels play a big part in the suspense, with Michelle Yeoh calculating that there's only enough air for four crew. Yet this was a vast ship with literally cubic acres of air in the bomb area alone (which begs the question, why have air around the bomb at all?). And all this oxygen was generated by the small plant area? I don't think so.- Why exactly did the first probe fail? Did everyone just decide to burn themselves up? Didn't quite catch that explanation.- If the mainframe fails, there's only one person who can operate the bomb. Why weren't the rest of the crew trained to operate it? What else did they have to practice on for 16 months? - The bomb will be traveling so fast space &amp; time will break down? Please. This thing is the mass of Manhattan, you're not going to accelerate it very fast.- Why was communication lost as they neared Mercury? We've had probes go to Mercury and even closer to the sun, and we've talked to them just fine.- All remaining plausibility flees at the end, when Capa detonates the bomb and has a leisurely gaze at..what? The wall of nuclear flame? The fires of creation? You tell me. The famously cryptic 2001 made a lot more sense than this.In general, much of the film impressed me as contrived situations to keep the crew in danger. This movie had a lot of potential, but Danny Boyle chose to get lost in his own head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We are in the not too distant future and the Sun is fading out. After a first mission to reignite it with a nuclear bomb fails, with the ship apparently lost in space, a new team are sent to try again. But it really isn't as simple as that.......Director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland team up once again for this sci-fi adventure thriller. For as long as I can personally remember, outer space and the planets that dwell within it, have always served us well for cinematic treats. Fears of the unknown and worries over the destruction of Earth, by and large make for great premise's. Not all films realise this potential of course, but it always makes for a great starting point. For his first venture into this realm, Boyle has gone for the Sun as his point of reference, and it makes for a marvellously claustrophobic picture that poses as many questions as it does answers. And even tho ultimately the science fiction aspects of it do not naturally add up, it's dazzling in its visuals and thought provoking into the bargain.Boyle has never hid his influences and favourites from the public, and here he homages everything from Alien to Event Horizon, stopping for tea and crumpets at 2001s house along the way. But that is no bad thing, molding elements from great sci-fi past with his own intriguing story has given Sunshine a tremendous heart, to which Boyle then manages to cloak it with high quality drama. The crew are up there and we know that this is a genre piece and things invariably go wrong, this gives the discerning viewer an eager anticipation, a sense that one shouldn't go to the toilet for something will be missed. And Boyle lives up to the promise showed, such a pity then, that Boyle didn't let us get better acquainted with his characters at the start. Because then the impact would surely have doubled as each perilous and wrought scenario unfolded.Having racked up the tension and intrigued us with the premise, expertly fusing CGI with his own craft work along the way, Boyle's Sunshine lives or dies by it's last quarter; depending on your proclivity of course. It has proved to be a most divisive point with critics and fans alike. To say it's a genre shift accompanied with implausibility is being a touch unkind I feel, this is after all a sci-fi picture about a ship going to reignite the Sun! Never the less it doesn't quite close the film triumphantly after the twists that preceded it, turns and explosions have lulled the viewers in, but personally it satisfies this entertained observer. Not in a big bang dynamic way, but in the way that asks me for a further thought process, and that may just be what Boyle and Garland envisaged when they sat down to make the film? Again, depending on your proclivity of course! 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The surface of the sun... every time I shut my eyes, it's all I see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>50 years from now, a crew of eight astronauts are heading to our dying sun via the colossal Icarus II spaceship. Having left earth frozen in a solar winter, they are humanity's last hope after the failure of the original Icarus mission several years earlier. They are to drop a massive nuclear bomb into the heart of the sun, hopefully reigniting the fading star. All of earth's remaining resources were mined to create the bomb, so there won't be another shot. Unfortunately, minds tend to crack under the most unbearable pressure one could ever imagine.A brilliant film. I will always remember August 8th, 2007 as the day when I first saw Sunshine. A most memorable date indeed, as I saw what would become second only to Requiem for a Dream on my list of all-time favorite films. Due to the dim bulbs at Fox, I had to drive all the way to North Richland Hills to see it, but never has going out of my way to see a film been more worth the effort.Danny Boyle's science fiction epic is pure, unadulterated tension. I actually became physically uncomfortable (sweating, tingling, the works) due to the tension and claustrophobia on display. Not only your typical claustrophobia, but claustrophobia of the mind as well. I felt every bit of psychosis, loneliness and pressure that the characters felt. To be that far from home for such a long time, all cramped up in a ship headed for the searing heat of the sun... I felt that. I rarely feel this way for film characters, but here, I felt the depth and the seriousness of their situation. I felt sucker punched every time one of them died. The demise of Kaneda was especially effective. The raw, emotional reactions from the actors sold it to me big time. It's sort of hard to explain, but Sunshine just hammered me in a way that more traditionally disturbing films aren't capable of. This film nails the horrors of psychological exhaustion as flawlessly as any film I've seen.It helps that the cast was uniformly excellent. Each character had their own unique voice and their own unique reaction to the situation at hand. Of the lot, Chris Evans really impressed me as Mace. I didn't think he was much of an actor before seeing him in this film. Special mention to my favorite actress, Rose Byrne. Her performances never disappoint, her charm is unmatched and she possesses a beauty more intense than the sun itself.I have no complaints about the third act. None. I will agree with general consensus that Alex Garland usually goes off the rails towards the end of his screenplays, but not here. It was clearly being built up to all throughout the film. Just look at the spiritual awakening that the sun inspires in Searle, or the first video message we see from Pinbacker. And yes, spirituality is used to fascinating effect, adding a deep layer of personal poignancy to the film. One of the key themes of Sunshine, after all, is man's relationship with the sun itself, the source of all life. It also allowed for the creepy aspect of Pinbacker posing the bodies of his victims.Unlike many people, I actually loved the filming technique used to shoot Pinbacker. It reminded me of the visible heat waves one often sees rising off of highway asphalt. The introduction of Pinbacker in the observation room, by the way, is a classic scene. Absolutely classic.This film was the one to push me into the whole HD/Blu-Ray thing. I had virtually no desire to upgrade formats, but this film was so astonishingly visual, it single-handedly opened me to the idea. I don't know if I've ever seen more beautifully realized visuals than those captured here. Couple that with the booming sound design and I'm so relieved that I managed to catch this theatrically. It was such an experience, and I'd like to replicate that experience as closely as possible with each future viewing.Sunshine is a stunning film that I could discuss endlessly. Fox really dropped the ball with promotion and distribution. It deserved so much better in that regard, but what's done is done. Now, if only the film's equally incredible soundtrack would hit CD in the near future.</fullReview>

The physicist Capa and the captain of the ship? 9) After 16 months, the captain, the psychologist and the physicist (who all look like they're from the same band) are all suicidal? 10) There's no protocol among astronauts about who is expendable and in what order? 11) No one is trained to do repairs beyond their specialty? 12) There's not a doctor on board? 13) An exploratory mission again includes the captain and the physicist -who is AGAIN called the most important person on the mission? 14) An unidentified man from the other ship boards their ship and this amazing computer neglects ANY MENTION OF IT? 15) This man is burned to a crisp but alive after 6.5 years of sun exposure at like five miles? But his entire crew is a pile of ashes? 16) No one else can survive the sun's rays but a psychopath? 17) Only when you ASK the computer, does it tell you that there's an unidentified person on the ship? But, it just calculated the remaining oxygen? 18) The person who cares most about the oxygen generation room doesn't care that they only have one? 19) Submerging the main frame computer manually into it's coolant requires going UNDER the computer, submerging oneself into the coolant tank? You can't make a button Lenovo? 20) the ending? ugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He Waits For Us In The Light</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead;We can all agree within this oppressive, intolerant tolerance that a devout film like DeMille's Ten Commandments or Ben Hur could never ever have been made. Do not believe me? Look at how they shamelessly paganized Noah. What a travesty! Yes, those tolerant stormtroopers bringing the light; they will stand no metaphysics even in 2007. So, poor Danny Boyle had to agree to have the villain Pinbacker to be the typical NEW AGE villain a Christian religious fanatic. He had to throw them this in order to be allowed to very subtly make a deeply religious film. The film is excellent till inexplicably Boyle decides to have a shaking camera and a Friday the 13th serial killer movie in the middle of what was a very promising beginning. Searle tells them that being engulfed in light is mystical; it is not at all like sensory deprivation in darkness. Light is fullness; it engulfs you. He even gets Takeda to try and find out what he is talking about. The film was a ten until Boyle wrecks it with the shaking camera and the silly religious kook serial killer on the loose crap. Undoubtedly, the studio so perturbed by the blatant religious overtones with the powerful ending demanded what these Nazis call balance. It wrecks the picture. Yet, it contains scenes that are so powerful I forgive Boyle much of the flaws of the picture. Takeda's death scene, with Searle yelling, TAKEDA WHAT DO YOU SEE? This is the core of this grim, depressing picture that is unrelentingly dark and dreary. What is in the light? Searle volunteers to stay behind knowing he will die to discover but it has consumed him, he must know. Takeda's death with the effects, music and the presentation is a truly powerful, stunning scene. The film has enough nobility within it to forgive it a great many flaws including the dreadful tree hugger bad acting Michelle Yeoh always an overrated, very poor actress. Yet, I adore the film for just one scene you will never forget, let the narrow minded Protagaorean empiricists laugh, when Capa sees his nimbus around his burning hands. He was an atheist; he stares within the bubble watches his hands burning sees his spirit and is astonished he is geist not flesh. Now, you know why the studio demanded a balancing religious kook. We simply cannot have an unsullied religious film today. We all know they are all insane. Our senses are the limits of the possible; just ask us, we know everything. The film has stunning visual effects, great acting and is two thirds of being a masterpiece. We can only hope someday Danny Boyle goes back and fixes the shaking camera which was such a mistake. Yet, I admire his bravery for just as during the Red Scare of the 50s we live during an age of complete intolerance for anyone who dares suggest any chance of there being a God; How dare You! Yes, paragons of tolerance they are not; they always evoke such laughter from me. Little simpletons, their little constructed phenomenal house of cards in their little pea brains; nobody disturb them they know all. Yes, He is all Light and Life and He waits for us within the Light. I congratulate Boyle for his courage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just finished watching Sunshine - it was so bad I felt I had to comment on it.I really wanted to enjoy this film and at times I did; however no matter how visually stunning it may be a film has to have a plot and characters that are believable.The real killer for me was the science. I'm prepared to make massive allowances; for instance it's an acknowledged fact that all Hollywood spaceships have artificial gravity that works even when the emergency lights fail. Eventually the nonsense built up to the point I couldn't ignore it any longer; a spaceship that needs a slingshot around Mercury to alter course yet can instantaneously brake alongside another in orbit; 'intelligent' computers that ignore extra crew members on board; a 'payload' that mysteriously doesn't burn up once it's heat-shield is gone; running out of oxygen in 15 hours yet having millions of litres of breathable atmosphere; in fact a spaceship design that is just nonsense! Science made nonsense to support a weak and predictable plot.Please don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Dumbest Science Fiction Movies Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know a movie is in trouble when the only thing interesting is looking forward to seeing an actor's (in this case, Cillian Murphy's) incredibly beautiful blue eyes! Those magnificent eyes do inspire! I wish I could say the same about anything else in this moronic movie!So much emphasis was placed on gruesome violence that it bordered on the pornographic, while at the same time there is zero sex, or romantic interest.ALL the laws of physics are completely thrown out the window, making it so ridiculous, it will boggle your mind: A 2001, Hal-like supercomputer falls apart like butter. Human beings can travel through space with nothing more than strips of aluminum wrapped around their body, and by holding their breath. Our sun is dying so a really big bomb can create another sun, on and on, ad nauseum!Somewhere along the line an evil mutant creature joins the party. He wants to destroy the world in order to send everyone to heaven! How nice! He waltzes in out of the blue. But he is not invisible, but he must be because no one saw him until they discovered he was breathing! (No, I'm not kidding!) In a way, this story is actually an extremely poorly written murder mystery under the guise of Science Fiction. It tries to create a foreboding mood, which ends up being about the only thing it creates! In some ways, Sunshine attempts to be a cross between Stanislaw Lem's "Solaris" (the Sun's alive, instead of a planet) and "Ten Little Indians" (knocking off those poor astronauts one-by-one)." Both films, are at least, a 100 times better movie than this rotten piece of celluloid! So save yourself a lot of aggravation, and rent one of them instead!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overreaches itself and burns up in the corona</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as the ill fated Icarus of Greek legend flew too close to the sun and ended up getting his wings burned and falling to earth, so this film, by an amazing coincidental analogy, burns itself out in the latter stages out by over-stretching credibility in terms of plot, screenplay and scientific plausibility.As many have already commented, the film starts off well enough, and we are treated to many fine CGI sequences which are truly works of art.Come to the later acts, though, and the film begins to unravel. It's not that there's anything particularly wrong with them in their own terms it's just that they are completely at odds with the baseline already set in the initial part of the film. The film ends on a sort mad Wagnerian symphony with many disjointed scenes, as if someone had said, "well I can't think of a way to end this film properly so lets just phase the audience with loads of rapidly cut explosions/slasher scenes/running scenes and hope that they'll all be so awed that they won't notice what a hotch potch I've made." *** Spoilers ahead **** OK What really annoyed me about this film, is that yes, a lot of effort had gone in to give it some scientific credibility, like the design of the spaceship, the spacesuits (which yes some reviewers have lambasted for their archaic/bulky look), but think about it if you were going near the sun, then big thick spacesuits would be necessary for thermal protection.But then it is all thrown away, with scenes in which people with no spacesuits are floating around in space and expected to survive. Hello space is a near vacuum and if you haven't already frozen solid then you're going to explode due to the lack of external pressure.Then we have the slasher guy, as if somehow Freddy Krueger had wondered onto the set, once again credibility is stretched because how does a guy covered with third degree burns manage to survive on his own for seven years ? Also, when they are messing around in the payload section, how come that's kept oxygenated? it's not like it needs to be aerated for a nuclear explosion to occur.In the final scenes we see Capa standing serenely having detonated the payload while enormous plasma flares are licking inches from his face, not withstanding the fact that they are now practically on the surface of the sun, how come he doesn't feel (or die from) the heat ? Are physicists somehow immune from the laws of physics ? ***** End of spoilers In summary then this film, starts off promisingly enough, but then jettisons its own values at an exponential rate, leaving us with the impression that somehow madness has taken over in the artistic process. One wonders if Danny Boyle isn't stuck on some sort of drug induced trip as a hangover from Trainspotting</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best sci-fi film I've seen in years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine is, quite simply, brilliant. From the opening sequence - simple yet effective and revealing so much about the character in question - right through to the end, I was gripped.Oddly for a sci-fi film, the power isn't in the effects or the sheer fantastic nature of the plot, it's in the people. From scary-eyed Cillian Murphy to pretty-boy Chris Evans, every performance is believable. Their reactions to events are so much more genuine-seeming than in just about every other film I've seen in recent years; be it joy, shock or grief, you can share it with them and this is something that a perfectly-worked score and some very accomplished camera-work add to handsomely. Whilst the personalities do lean towards certain conventions, none of them are so much so that they couldn't be explained away as being a result of or necessary to their profession - the slightly distant and isolated physicist; the cool-headed and pragmatic captain; the biologist who is passionate about their charges but emotionally-distant from their crew-mates.The dialogue too is spot-on with nothing coming across as being too clichéd or too hammy. It all seems like real things that real people would say, from the casual banter to the emotional outpourings and everything in between. Unlike so many other films, the characters are human and they act like humans - there is no casual detachment and needless bandying of glib phrases.The effects are exactly what they need to be in balance to this - believable but not distracting from eight very dynamic performances; complementing rather than show-stealing and over-awing.All in all it's more of a psychological thriller than a traditional sci-fi extravaganza and whilst this has been done many times before - 2001: Space Odyssey, Solaris, Silent Runnings; to name a few - Sunshine does it superbly and without fault. I'd highly recommend this film to anyone who is looking for something more than just easy entertainment to kill a couple of hours. Conversely, if you ~are~ just looking for something light then keep on looking - this is not a film to be only half-watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious, plodding and absurd...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a pretentious, boring excursion this movie was! If people want to make films that consist of mood pieces, weird camera and lighting effects, and drawn-out character set-pieces, why oh why do they have to try and make them science fiction films? Red Planet was a good science fiction film. 2001: A Space Odyssey was a good science fiction film until the last five minutes. Sunshine doesn't even come close.Apart from the absurd premise of the film (the sun is going out, so we'll go and set off a nuclear bomb inside it to fix it - yeah, that'll work!), there is absolutely no explanation as to why the crew of the Icarus I all died, nor why Pinbacker (sp??) went nuts and wanted to kill everyone...not to mention how he managed to survive on his own for six years with 3rd degree burns all over his body.If it's called "science fiction", it should at least PRETEND to be somewhat scientifically accurate. Here's a hint or two for the film-makers: 1) People do not freeze do death in space. They asphyxiate. Vacuum is a terrific insulator, not conductor (which is why we use vacuum flasks to keep liquids hot or cold). You can only lose heat in space via radiation, not conduction or convection.2) Only a lunatic would create a ship for 8 crew-members and rely on fruit &amp; vegetables to produce oxygen. There are far more efficient ways of doing it using electricity - which should be plentiful considering how much solar energy was available! 3) Gravity is either produced by mass, or simulated by a rotating habitat. Good sci-fi films do not have "magical" gravity that suddenly switches on and drops everyone to the floor when the airlock re-pressurizes. It's fine in Star Trek or Star Wars, but it just looks stupid in an ostensibly "hard" sci-fi film.Don't waste your time with this piece of drivel. It's two hours you'll never get back. Watch Red Planet or The Island if you want some decent science fiction...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my absolute favorites, but with a large caveat...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me skip the preamble about how great Boyle/Garland are, because most people who've seen "Sunshine" know this already. The cast/acting are top-notch, and the movie looks spectacular as if it cost a heck of a lot more to make than it actually did.After the initial scenes where you meet the crew of the ship and learn their story/mission, the rest of the movie is so tense and gripping I've never really encountered anything like it. I may just be a sucker for the sci-fi/thriller genre, but the situation these people are in and the fates they're presented with (not only death, but the death of all mankind) are so oppressive the viewer can't help but experience some of the fear for themselves.Fictional characters have often held the fate of mankind in their hands, but usually in unrealistic situations (i.e., some super-villain threatens to blow up planet Earth and a superhero must stop him). Sure, we can go back over statements and situations in the film that could be proved false or unrealistic, but anyone who isn't an astrophysicist will have an easy time believing every second.The only issue I've got with "Sunshine" (spoiler) is how it ended with Captain Pinbacker sneaking aboard the Icarus II and attempting to sabotage the mission as he did with the Icarus I. I won't go through all my thoughts as to why it seemed unrealistic; it just seemed like a bit of a cop-out. As if, when Garland was writing it, he thought "Ok the crew have just experienced all of these tragedies, and are now on their way to complete the mission, but we've got to throw an even bigger and more intense tragedy in there to spice up the ending." I'll never be close to the greatness of Garland as a writer, and I won't claim to have any ideas as to how it should have ended. I will say I wished he'd have taken after Arthur C. Clarke's "Rendezvous With Rama" where, after a vacant, ominous spaceship appears in our solar system, the story ends with the spaceship simply using the suns gravitational field to slingshot away toward an unknown destination... the story itself was good enough that it didn't require a super-villain assaulting the main characters to make for a suitable ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible science fiction, not given enough attention!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It frightens me that critics can rave so much about a bland film like "Social Network" but I never heard of a genius science fiction film like "Sunshine" accept by randomly browsing on Netflix.Truly great Science Fiction is very rare. 2001, Blade Runner, most recently Primer, and so when one is created it should be celebrated; "Sunshine" is that film.Most so-called "Science Fiction" films are actually operas or action films set in space. True science fiction should teach us and explore the boundaries of science via a plot that happens to currently be fictional, but could be easily believed to be real one day. By doing so we are engaged in the story and characters and the future of mankind."Sunshine" not only accomplishes this, but in a very subtle way dives into the realm of time-space warping and the bending of physics as we know it without ever discussing how or why (and I won't give it away, find it if you can).I don't know of any film this brave in its subtext since 2001. Amazing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some years ago, two of the great filmmakers made "space ship" movies. Kubrick's version was a masterpiece in narrative engineering, a story about who is control of the story: man, machine or god; alternatively viewer, writer, performer. It was framed in a cinematic scope unseen at the time, visually and musically. It changed the world and not just the world of how we envision outer space. Few since have been able to play with narrative battle as adroitly since, "2001" being something as rich in narrative folds as "Citizen Kane" before or "Annie Hall" after."Star Wars" and "Star Trek" are toys in comparison.A device in 2001 was machine, grandly and Germanically engineered as contrasted with the vast active sphere whose mystical influence we slowly discover. Tarkovsky followed with "Solaris." Its not as grandly conceived, alas. He had the ability but not the allowance. But he uses this same globular moil with similar transcendental influence. But his narrative twist went one further, reflecting back on the story the character sees as well as what we do.Soderbergh remade it recently, trying hard to work in sizzling vision, having an adequate budget. But he was unsuccessful, I think because all he did was copy what Tarkovsky wrought. We've evolved in what we expect, and in particular how much visual ambiguity we are willing to allow.So now we have this. I think it deserves to be considered with these two. I was very, very impressed. The story itself is mundane, surely not as reflected back on itself as the other two. Its wholly contained within the characters we see. Its just their obsessions and not ours that are manhandled. But the visual vocabulary we are given! Wow, this man surely deserves our appreciation.Where he's coming from is obvious. In previous projects, what he's done is develop a notion of a parallel, even fabled reality, and then jumped directly into it, giving us markers along the way of the ordinary reality we left. Druggies, kids. Now it is stellar beings. The images are more intense. The characters on screen become dangerously captivated by them. As the story develops, we encounter a being that has crossed over and who is shown always as a blur. Its magical what this one decision does. But its in the context of the tendrilled brightness that it all captures us similarly.Oh, you have all sorts of ordinary bits: fights, missions, sacrificial struggles, men lost in space, exploding fireballs and all that. But they're there to satisfy the kids who pay the bills so real men and women can stretch their dreams.Just consider one scene, the last one. We are set up for it early in the film where our hero makes a film for the folks back home. We see that movie-within after we know that some mystical event has occurred that "we" on Earth will never, could never, know. We see a desolate landscape with the Sydney Opera House in the near background. A stellar event occurs. The setting is mystical itself. Its as though our voyager Boyle has connected and delivered new life to us. Its very carefully perfect.This has not been officially released in my country. When it is, I hope to see it on the biggest screen I can, and it may make the list of the two most important films of 2007.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-fi back to the roots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first explain my vote. Sunshine is NOT the best sci-film ever. As many others stated, it's not setting a new standard, as it recalls many other movies in the past. So what's the value in it? Exactly the fact that it recalls the best sci-fi movies ever, with the highest standard. As in "28 days after", where director Boyle made one of the best Zombie movies ever, Sunshine gets the best of the best genre movies in the past (2001, Solaris, Alien...) and eventually succeeds. Sunshine is a must-see for those who are nostalgic about the good ole movies where the outer space is used as a mean to explore our fear for the unknown. It's amazing how Sunshine made me feel uncomfortable and scared, in this period of Japanese horror movies remakes that make me laugh at every single scene. That's because the movie makes you actually feel like you're on a Mercury's orbit, waiting to be thrown at the sun. Because it succeeds to make you feel alone, with no hope to stay alive. And this is a breathe of fresh air again, after an era of sci-fi pop-corn movies such as Armageddon, easy rollercoasters where the only thing that can give a spark of emotion is Aerosmith's soundtrack.Now, let's play, just because other did, the game of setting the point of references Danny Boyle studied(and widely used) to direct Sunshine; of course, the movie is plenty of scenes and moments borrowed from 2001: A Space Odissey, Solaris, Alien and, yes, Event Horizon.But I would add another clear source of inspiration: the fantastic video game "System Shock 2". The hydroponic areas are EXACTLY as those in the game, and Pinbacker's character reminds me that of Capt. Korenchkin (and its name reminds me that of the ship Rickenbacker).All in all, a must-see sci-fi movie, for those who love the genre and hate all the Armageddons and Missions to Mars of the recent past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually effective but not written by a hard/real SF writer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to the director, Boyle, the film is about "what happens to your mind when you meet the creator of all things in the universe." (The Guardian) I read that interview of Boyle's after I had seen the film, and I thought, what??? The Sun is the creator of all things in the universe? That's a distortion of the fact that the Sun makes life possible on Earth.The story was written by Alex Garland, who also wrote The Island. I don't believe the film was ultimately well thought out in terms of theology or physics. It really came across as a try-hard sci-fi spirituality film, despite Boyle's attempt at presenting the sun as the "giver of life" and "source of all knowledge" (from The Guardian also). The main problem was that this premise is not a widely accepted cultural idea in our world today. Given that fact, you would need to present this idea very well in the film. And that was definitely not achieved - the sun was a potentially dangerous but predictable and passive (in the sense that its state did not change without impetus from human intervention) power. Even the final scene of "awakening" of Capa character was more like an MTV moment than a spiritual vision. All of a sudden, because a HUMAN BEING created a bomb that reignited the sun, the subsequent surge in power of the Sun is suddenly supposed to be spiritual and godly? The comparisons to 2001 were quite offensive. Where was the acknowledgement of the human's intelligence and technological efforts in making it happen? Because that factor was pretty much the ENTIRE story of the film.Also, being an avid sci-fi fan, a lot of things about this film just did not make sense. If ICARUS II was short on oxygen, what was the engineer and rose byrne's character doing in the penultimate scene, running around inside the massive bomb container without oxygen masks? Looks like they had plenty of oxygen to spare to me.And why send only one person who could set off the bomb? They "mined the earth" for the resources to make the bomb but out of a crew of eight, only one person was trained to set it off/manage it? Totally implausible.In short, lots of holes and ultimately not very well thought-out.</fullReview>

Maybe a certain percentage of the viewing audience feels better about itself watching people make stupid mistakes in a movie touted as an intelligent science fiction drama: I just feel sad and ripped off.

OMG lol that's stupid, and by wearing sunglasses it makes it all coolio(LMAO). then there is a stupid GREEDY idea of the second bomb- which that mace guy has the nerve to blame kappa for in the end, not that they didn't give him sole responsibility and you know if they hadn't gone for the second bomb it would have been his fault still. so they go, loose 2 crew members burn the ship, decide 3 people must die then pick up 1 more; who has been so sun exposed its a wonder how he lasted 1) for 6.5 years 2) without developing skin cancer and 3) why he is even in the bloody movie!! i couldn't watch no more of the movie after this. i walked out.flush money down the toilet its a better way of wasting it. or better yet give it to charity.to add insult to injury there is this bit where they go into the other ship and you know in "fight club" where brad pitts character starts putting into the kiddy movies frames of porno, that effect is used. however it comes across as if some loser got into the projection room and wanted to have a giggle. its not until they occur more often that u get the idea that its supposed to happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK - the space effects and such looked cool. The ships looked cool. It had nice special effects. The human drama issues and moral quandaries were reasonable issues to bring up. Yet many of the story twists and complications (actually most of them) were um..."borrowed" (I say it kindly) from other movies (far too common these days) - with pieces of technology taken from everything from "Event Horizon" &amp; "Dr Who" to "The Abyss".BUT - the most important failure here is - science fiction -MUST- have science in it, at least speculative science, or the whole thing dies. The science in this movie is beyond bad. Even the "Star Wars" saga, with space ships that cornered in a vacuum just like airplanes do in an atmosphere, had a better grasp of science than these people did.This movie was woefully lacking in basic science. It was done with no understanding of even the most basic physical laws. They were trying to rescue the planet earth by saving our sun...fixing a problem that cannot happen, with methods that could not work.HOW DO SUNS WORKThe sun does not act the way this movie shows us. Suns function due to a vast quantity of atoms pressing inward due to GRAVITY. Our sun is not going to stop working in another 50 years. It will be chugging along, long after we (humanity) has long been extinct. Their entire premise for how to reignite a sun is beyond stupid (since it is not a fire anyway). A sun is a STAR - a massive fusion reaction. To get it to keep going (should it fail) you would need one of two things:1) hydrogen (and far more than any group of humans could ever amass) to fix the problem. 2) or a way to turn the other elements in that sun, back into the hydrogen that it all used to beAlso a sun dies when the elements that are in it (starting out as hydrogen) have fused into heavier and heavier elements and then into far too much iron. Then you have troubles (several billions of years from now).NOT ENOUGH OXYGENHumans (when our cells work) produce water due to our normal animal biology. Yes we do also exhale CO2, but that is very easy to scrub. We do it today just fine. On a space ship, the biggest problem is getting rid of the WATER which accumulates everywhere (we breathe it out and we sweat it out of us). It has to be removed from the air. Also, water is H2O - part oxygen and part hydrogen and a whole lot of kids have split off that oxygen in science class - back down into hydrogen and oxygen. How come they did not know how to do this?Remember all of those wet locations in the ship in Alien? That was far more realistic.Also why did they use big plants to scrub their air, instead of just using algae inside of transparent plates - which grows far faster and makes far more O2 per surface area? That is how our planet got so much free oxygen. It makes way more sense than big plants do? I suppose that that was not pretty enough for them.ALSO - when they did lose their CO2 scrubbing plants, it would not have mattered at all to their mission. Why? It would have taken a very long time for that few humans to use up the amount of oxygen in a ship of that size. The ship was massive. Exactly how much oxygen per day do 4 to 6 people need to survive? How they could have not had enough oxygen to make it to the sun when they were right next to it (half a day just by gravity)? They were close enough that is caused their ship harm. They needed special shielding. The volume of that huge ship was filled with AIR (not vacuum). Even after all their various problems, that thing was so HUGE they could have lived on the air in it for many months without any noticeable build-up of carbon dioxide.But let us pretend otherwise and depart from reality for a second. *WHY* do we have a scene in which one of the crew so very happy to find one tiny living plant spout growing in the remains of their ships oxygen scrubbing system? Why? It would have taken many years to grow enough plants to make a scrubber for a ship that large (large enough for far more people than were on it).First they are sad due to the death of their plants, which they do not need given that the energy from the sun was more than enough to run old fashioned non-plant CO2 scrubbers (as used by NASA now) and as they were HEADED FOR THE SUN they would have had lots of solar power.So, why build a forest in the ship for atmosphere scrubbing, if it is not ever leaving the solar system? Somebody must have thought it was pretty. Perhaps they saw it in another movie or TV show.STUPID SCIENCE KILLED THE SHOW FOR ME Stupid science destroyed the movie. Anyone who passed high school basic science (in fact most 6th grade science classes teach the needed pieces) could have given them better ideas than the ones they used. Next time, when doing science fiction, get a person on your team who knows a little science.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really enjoying the movie to begin with, and it had all the makings to be a great Sci-Fi film. But just as the movie was heating up, it's like the script writer got carried away with all these ideas and decided to cram them all into one film.If they had just stuck with a single, well thought out story line and a few plot twists, it would have been great. Instead, I had to watch a completely perplexing display of twists and turns until the story line was completely incomprehensible and unrecognisable.I honestly had no clue what was going on for most of the final 30 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A study of Character &amp; Motives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got the DVD so I could watch it sans a theatre filled with miscellaneous Cellphone diatribes.I won't give any of the plot away. I will say that the story is tense and close. The Sun is going out (For some reason) and Earth has sent a team of specialists to insert a 'device' to re-ignite ole Sol. The Story is NOT about the hand-wave-ium science behind the bomb or the high technology of the time. In fact there is almost NO regular sci-fi pseudo explanation or in-depth lectures about Solar Flares or the physics of Stars. I would say that the Sci-Fi is all in the Backdrop. When you See the Ship you are seeing pretty much ALL the conventional Sci-Fi of the Movie. And I must say the ship design is good and Plausible and awesome. I give the movie an 8 because of their little oversight with "Artificial Gravity".What I applaud the movie for that what unfolds. It's all about the uneasy thoughts and fears and motives of each of the crewmembers as they near the culmination of the mission, even if it means their deaths-- because the mission MUST succeed. . .or everyone on Earth dies. What you see being played by the characters are studies in Fatalism, Control-Freak, Suicidalness, Madness, Helpless Fear, Cravenness, Cold-heartedness, etc. What will NOT be there will be the standard Hollywood personality staples. As you already know-- Bruce Willis is NOT on board. And even though we do have the Man of 'Johnny Storm' fame-- make no mistake: He is ACTING. There are no torrid sex scenes between the standard romantic set-ups. No improbably quirky-cute scenarios. Just people on edge.The Backdrop of it all is the fact that Space is not just Lethal-- it's Unforgiving of Mistakes. There is no leeway for design flaws. There's no rescue from Miscalculation. This is Hard-Sci-Fi at it's best. It's Dark. Better yet-- it's a Drama play.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He Waits For Us In the Light</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:This will be a philosophical review of why I love this movie I defer to others for more scene for scene reviews. Many have criticized the film for its relentlessly grim and depressing feel. I consider that Danny Boyle will be remembered for this great film years from now. First why I deduct 2 for the wobbly camera that wrecks what could have been a 10 without this and the descent into Friday the 13th slasher picture the last 30 minutes. Also some weak acting specifically Michelle Yeoh with her silly obsession with plants hello remember the people around you are they more important to you? This tree hugger moment is truly silly.Now what I love about the picture. Even in 2007 religious ideas were declared to be heresy and filmmakers who dared were blacklisted. So like the Red Scare of the 50s the ideas have to be concealed within the story so the filmmaker may clandestinely express ideas that if openly expressed would lead to the film not being made. First, notice how Searle expresses that being engulfed within the light is a very mystical experience it is not like being surrounded by the emptiness of space. Soon he has Kaneda joining him in the observation lounge. I got the strong feeling the studio was so uncomfortable with Boyle's near the surface allusions to God in the light they had to make Pinbacker a murderous religious kook. Two scenes make it a great film. First when Kaneda dies Searle yells at him what he wants to know KANEDA WHAT DO YOU SEE? Searle even volunteers to stay behind for this very reason he doesn't care if it kills him something is in the light he has to see what it is. The Kaneda death scene with the music and effects is a true masterpiece it has to be seen to be believed mystical and powerful but nothing like the best scene in the movie. Fearless Capa's death. As the ship melts and explodes Capa is encased in a translucent bubble where he stares at the nimbus surrounding his burning fingers and realizes that he is geist not flesh. It is burning but he is still there. I love all the mockery of this scene by earlier reviewers perhaps you should read more back from death testimonies before your retarded materialism makes you sound like the pompous asses you are. Materialism their holy grail; anyone who dares to laugh at their silly constructed phenomenal reality and point out all the contradictions within materialism like the finite versus infinite antinomy is also mocked. Yes their puny senses are the universal touchstones for the phenomenal versus the noumeanal. Please read Kant try to break free from the bring the light happy thought new age crap. Yes they have already died you know they know all about it and are happy to laugh at your heresy that maybe just maybe we might not know all there is out there you think? I love the modeling of nobility by Capa; he is not portrayed as a superhuman macho hero like Harry Stemper in Armaggedon. He is very quiet in his dedication to the mission he can be quite ruthless like Mace towards Trey when he thinks that he threatens the mission. When Cassie asks him if he is afraid he simply reminds her the consequences of failure; no, he is not afraid. Cillian Murphy is such a good understated actor without the usual yelling Chris Evans subjects us to. A very great portrayal of nobility. I never get lost in the scientific minutia the film is primarily philosophical with deeply religious overtones. The premise itself given the size of the sun is of course absurd. A bomb the size of the earth itself would still be so tiny compared to the sun. For all the shaky camera-work serial killer craziness it is a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Science, Bad Acting, Mediocre Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sunshine" follows a small group of people commissioned to deliver a bomb to our dying sun in 2057. It certainly fits "fiction". Not so much "science". Given that we've known for a while the sun is going to be around for oh, about 6 billion years, their margin of error is pretty big. Past that, we know that before it actually runs out of hydrogen, it's going to swell up like a balloon and fry everything on the surface of the Earth. The film makes no attempt at explaining these inconsistencies, nor do they explain how anything, let alone their ship, can travel into the sun to deliver this "bomb". If you can get past the bad science, you'll have to get past the cheesy, unconvincing acting. Never been a fan of Cillian Murphy and this film is a good example of why. He can't do something as mundane as drink from a glass without trying to look like drinking water is some sort of emotional turning point in the film.The plot didn't help the acting, either. I realize this is cinema, but when you have grown adults, presumably some of the best scientists from Earth, acting irrationally like they're really convicted felons on a prison space ship -- it's hard to put yourself into a "this could happen" mentality. Quite the opposite. Overall, the script could have been way better and so could the acting. Rose Byrne as well as Cliff Curtis were decent -- he should have been lead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Begins as a smart movie about dumb people, but ends simply as a dumb movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that doesn't credit its audience with any sort of intelligence. The crew is almost exclusively compromised of attractive psychological time bombs that for the sake of the plot all have their "specialty" like an ill-fitted group of superheroes. So as it goes in this future spaceship there's only one "physicist"! That's right; aboard a spaceship that the entire existence of the human race depends upon there is a single guy who goes by the title "physicist" and happens to be the only person that can actually detonate the bomb they set out to deliver to the Sun... seriously??? this should've set off alarms immediately but I thought it my duty as a member of the audience to exert an effort in suspending disbelief at this point...a bit of effort turned into a LOT of effort. Eventually, after numerous instances of people failing to be harmed by the lack of pressure in space, or by radiation, or there being any sort of consequent application of gravity inside and outside of the ship etc. etc. one begins to wish the character drama would make up for it being a poor science film. No such luck. Unfortunately, as I mentioned in the beginning, not only are these people psychologically and educationally unfit compared to current astronauts, but I'd wager they'd fare badly against a group of 13 year old in an aptitude test. I suppose the storyline HAD to be supplemented with characters acting immaturely and on first instinct without any sort of deliberation; after all a last chance mission to kickstart the Sun and save humanity aboard an 8 member ship couldn't supply its own drama without additional emotional triggers! RIGHT?! ...right?the only thing i regret wasting more than my time here is the incredible potential this storyline had. With smarter execution and proper characters instead of the badly sketched out 5 year olds that manned this disastrous mission it truly could've been an incredibly scifi film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific movie about the loneliness of space travel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was growing up, I used to watch a lot of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" episodes. These conveyed the impression to me that futuristic space travel could be dangerous, but also exciting and fun. This has effectively been overturned after viewing "Sunshine".Set in the near-future, it concerns a group of scientists and astronauts who have been a sent on a long-term mission to prevent the sun from dying by dropping a nuclear bomb in it. The loneliness of their ordeal begins to erode their sanity, and the fate of the mission and that of humanity is thrown into doubt...The film benefits from a number of gently understated performances, particularly from Cillian Murphy as the head scientist Capa. Michelle Yeoh is also very good as a botanic astronaut and the supporting parts are convincingly cast and played.I enjoyed the look of of the movie, using sleek colours of gold, grey and black to good effect and the science of the story is intelligently conveyed without being too comprehensible. The filmmakers employ a variety of camera angles and shots that convey the increasing disorientation of the crew. The film takes an unfortunate slide into horror-movie territory towards the end, with the introduction of a possibly supernatural being who begins slaughtering everyone. Given the invention and detail present earlier in the story, the last-minute introduction of a cliché is slightly disappointing. Still, the film survives to deliver a satisfying ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..This ain't.This is an example of which audience you can persuade with heavy visual and sonic artillery. That's what this production is about - fighting, screaming, machismo, boom, bam. According to the IMDb rating, some of us are obviously happy with that.I went to the theater hoping to see a film of substance, ingeniousness and general mind-jarring strangeness. Sunshine is a simple and dumb action flick. At times visually entertaining though.Most of the characters are aggressive, emotionally unstable and with a few exceptions act to their own desires. Anyone familiar with military training or for that matter business management knows that a failing team is a failing mission. What on earth were those who selected and trained this team, for a task that would end or save humanity, smoking? That's the basic premise on which this film fails. A story about a mission in space or a hostile environment must have a group of people that are credible as scientists, astronauts and mot of all *crew* members (as, for example the characters in 2001, Alien or Contact are).The crew in Sunshine (well, except the man who dies repairing a shield element), is a bunch of screaming, narcissistic teenagers. Hell of a noise but neither dangerous nor interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refuge in Darkness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine, directed by Danny Boyle, is only a visual and psychological journey, not an emotional one. Chris Evans, from Fantastic Four, surprisingly gives a realistic and convincing performance as to how an astronaut would act in the face of the end of the world. What tremendous pressure they must feel, but unfortunately no one other than the human torch conveys this. Capa (Cillian Murphey), in one scene, explains that he doesn't fear death, but his explanation only makes me feel like his character has no will or motivation to live. This comes across as bad acting rather than subliminal character development. The computer generated imagery enhances the confused story that makes for a so-so experience. Notice how I say that the story is confused, it does not know what it is and therefore suffers from a failure to present itself well. More on the story later. The sun is a character of its own; constantly we are being shown solar images that convey its sheer power. In the observation room, a meer five percent of sunlight exposure can blind you. The films screenwriter, Alex Garland, and Danny Boyle are said to have disagreed over the meaning of the screenplay; Garland finds it as a reference to the search for God, while Boyle finds it representing global warming. The film's villain is really the the sun, where tragedy and confusion is based in light and the audience find refuge in the dark. Boyle references tackling this concept as "quite a challenge because the way you generate fear in cinema is darkness." It is rare when a science fiction film tries to convey deeper meaning. The film, I would say, is split into three acts: the first is character interaction during a calm period, the second is the accident and the quest to fix it, and the third is the twist where everything is turned upside down. We have all seen poor attempts at this science fiction disaster genre like The Core, but never before has a film like this thrown in such a disastrous twist that completely flushes itself down the toilet. Alex Garland has certainly got some explaining to do. My main problem with this film is my lack of interest in the characters and the horrendous plot twist that turns this philosophical journey into a sub par slasher flick. This is a great film for fans of Boyle and the genre, but how much you let the third act disappoint you is, well...up to you. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say as a fan of Mr Boyle I was a tad disappointed. Before going to see this movie I read the summary and some doubts crossed my mind initially with the storyline. Sun is burning out, off the humans rush to reignite it... blah blah blah and then I saw the line on, something happens along the way. This nugget of mystery had me suckered and I hoped with Mr Boyle's history, a unique, original and clever story ensued.Back from the cinema an hour, well it has provided some riveting conversation since I walked out. I found it hard throughout the movie to keep quite as one malfunction after another appeared in the plot, script and character development. Now I can begin to list them all here, although any avid movie goer can honestly admit to himself that there was quite a few. At the bottom you can read my summary. The movie appears to move from what I believe had truly great potential to a faded montage of ideas from movies such as 2001, 2010, Sphere, Event Horizon, Alien and more. It lacked a clear message and little emotional intelligence. I found myself amazingly isolated from any of the characters and had no sympathy as they toppled like well placed dominoes.The movie even takes on a pitiful self-righteous path of moral questioning about man and his role of playing God. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Leave it to the Bible bas hers and as Inspector Charmers says in the Simpsons, "Prayer has no place in our schools ... just like facts have no place in organized religion." I say to you a Sci-Fi movie made by the brilliant Danny Boyle that revolves around the human races trying to survive a burnt out sun by sending a ship with explosives to reignite it, is the last place to throw in God story of that sort. With such beautiful direction and visual effects, Sunshine had the capacity to be a Cult Classic. Sadly, I fear that it will become a classic for the wrong reason.

		<shortDescription>Very overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a (currently) 7.3 user rating, I was looking forward to what I hoped would be a decent movie. What a letdown. I suppose I should have paid more attention to the reviewer that said, "One word of advice: this movie is not for nitpickers or physicist," yet still gave it 8 stars.I'm neither a nitpicker nor a physicist, but as a reasonably intelligent person there are limits to how far I am willing to suspend disbelief. The whole premise of the movie is on very shaky ground: The sun is dying and the first mission to launch some kind of bomb into the sun failed, so mankind has sent the second, and this is our Last Hope.Now, this bomb, whatever it's supposed to be and to do, is not really explained very well. I gather that the specifics are given here on IMDb and the movie's website; kind of odd to leave that out of the movie itself. I'm also not sure how a bomb with the mass of Manhattan is supposed to reignite the sun, which can fit 1,000,000 Earths inside of it, but then perhaps I'm being nit-picky.The next thing that begs explanation is why they need to get so close to the sun to launch this bomb in the first place. Why not launch it from the vicinity of, say, Venus's orbit? We can make pinpoint unmanned landings on Mars, but a target the size of the sun seems to be a problem.The physicist is the only one who knows how to properly turn the key and hit the launch button on the bomb (say what?), yet he is 'volunteered' to go on a dangerous spacewalk with no objections. Later on he is given the only spacesuit so that he is assured survival. Apparently his essentialness comes and goes.After various implausible mishaps involving human error and a computer that only seems to correct these errors when it's in the mood, we learn that they only have enough oxygen for 4 people to make it to the launch point. Now, this ship is huge. I mean really, really big. It's also full of air. Remember Apollo 13, with 3 guys in the tiny capsule/lunar module? Even they had enough air to get back home. Yet, 5 people on this massive ship would use up all the O2 in less than a day.I could go on a lot longer, and you can read other reviews for even more ludicrous problems with this script, but you get my drift here. Yes, visually the exterior shots are great, though random, without giving a sense of "where" things are happening. Looking pretty isn't enough to save this movie, however.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To put it simply, the whole plot was doomed along with the poor planet Earth! Why? Easy: when the nuclear fusion process that keeps our star 'alive' starts going down the drain, the Sun does not start 'cooling off': rather, gravity wins the fiery battle and it causes a temporary collapse of its external strata. This in turn generates a renewed peak of nuclear fusion, and at that point our beloved Sun abandons the main sequence of the HR diagram and turns into a GOD-DARNED RED GIANT!!! Get it? By then our planet is destined to be turned into one single molten lava ball tidally locked to the fiery stellar cadaver! Then, after the fusion processes are long exhausted and the iron core cannot turn into heavier elements, our Sun becomes a small and 'cold' white dwarf, and what is left of Earth will solidify again into a barren, endless icy desert. Oh, yes, this means that humanity has long perished before attempting their daring rescue!PS - and if they are using ALL THEIR FISSILE MATERIAL (switching off your brain and taking for granted you could 'ignite' your star by using what is, in cosmic terms, a grain of plutonium) for the second mission, what did they use in the first? Methane bombs or all the flames from the Internet?</fullReview>

Why can't I just TURN IT OFF! Because I am an eternal optimist who stupidly hopes the plot/acting will take a turn for the better. It never does. Basically a remake of Solar Crisis (1990) except instead of short circuiting a Solar Flare with a big bomb, they want to jump-start the sun with a big bomb. Hmmm - kind of like restarting the Earth's core with a big bomb. I guess Hollywood's answer to any ecological problem is to blow it up with a Big Bomb. Must be a Bush-era thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It never ceases to amaze me just how critical people can be or how they will pick a movie such as Sunshine to pieces without simply sitting back and enjoying. Understanding Sunshine is quite frankly more than just a group of people strapped to the largest bomb mankind has ever made but more to the fact that it is look into the minds of these individuals and the effects such a voyage might have on each individual,take a moment to consider just how such a responsibility might effect your own thinking. To begin,this is Danny Boyle to a tee,he creates some wonderful moments between each of the characters for example the first viewing of the planet Mercury as it glides across the face of the sun,the camera simply expresses the look of wonder on each and every member of the crew and his style of never quite showing us the sole survivor of the doomed Icarus 1 yet his image is firmly embedded in every scene he is present. Much like audiences failed to understand the ending of 2001 so many years ago on its release it seems the same effect has happened with Sunshine and many consider the ending boring,even going as far to say it is the worst ending to a movie they have ever seen,lets understand the ending however because it is not meant to be a happy ending by any means it is simply put an ending that is meant to relay beauty,the chain reaction of the Stella bomb igniting and the awesome power of the sun finally meeting at so called ground zero and for a split second the doomed sole survivor Cappa is caught between these two immense forces colliding,he experiences the true beauty of Sunlight,this moment in the movie to me sums up Danny Boyles film making style period. The score created for the movie by band Underworld is perfectly suited and each cast member takes us on their own personal journey thanks in part to the wonderful direction from Boyle himself. On a whole yes Sunshine does have its flaws but instead of picking it to pieces as so many have I suggest you sit back and enjoy Danny Boyles journey to save our most precious planet from extinction</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Boyle has created a film inspired by the titans of the sci-fi genre, 2001, Alien, Solaris etc... Right from the start, with the quiet opening voice over of Cillian Murphy's strong voice, Boyle starts building the power of the sun with his use of the colour pallets used on the interior and exterior of the Icarus II - robbing us of any vibrant colour inside the ship with a lot of blues and greens while we're inside the ship. And the sound of the sun - something lost on a lot of today's modern sci-fi epics - with the furry and the force of the sun hitting the shield. A great answer to how can you show the power of something you can't see? The energy being emitted from the sun. Which only speaks to the creativity and fearlessness of Boyle. From not giving us the traditional globe helmets on the fantastically realistic EVA suits to see which actor is in the suit to having a soundtrack composed by John Murphy and the electronic band, Underworld - which has created one of the most beautiful and unique scores I've ever heard.Boyle has cast a crew as unique as the rest of his film starting with, Hiroyuki Sanada as Keneda. Everyone of these actors are fantastic with these powerful performances centered more with looks and body language then dialogue. 8 cast members and not a single one gives up anything to another member but the true stand out to this cast is Chris Evans. Who takes this performance and proves beyond a shadow of any doubt that he can stand on screen with actor's actor like Hiroyuki Sanada, Cillian Murphy, Cliff Curtis, Rose Byrne and Mark Strong.The sequence with the crew watching Mercury orbiting the sun is one of the most brilliant scenes in cinematic history in my opinion. The beautiful CGI shots of Mercury against the sun (that looks better then 200 million dollar pictures at a fraction of the cost it would take to pay for lunch on those productions) with the beautiful score from John Murphy and Underworld. Boyle's choice to let the imagery speak for itself as we look upon the crew.And finally, Boyle chooses to end the film as quietly as he began the film with an understated brightening of the sun on a frozen Australia - almost as if the sun was rising for a new day. Very well done - letting the story play out.Sunshine is a truly unique film that can stand with titans of the genre of science fiction films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done realistic sci-fi movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 6/24/2009 ? 8 out of 10 ( Dir- Danny Boyle): Well done realistic sci-fi movie about a group of astronauts sent out to re-energize the sun(on their second attempt) due to an ice age occurring on the earth because the sun's energy has lessoned. The things that makes this movie work is it's deliberate pacing, realistic characters on the ship and the story that hits home with our current global-warming crisis. The first mission was lost, supposedly, and this one is supposed to explode a bomb into the sun to re-ignite it. The crew consists of scientists, government personnel, doctors and an on-board vegetable garden to provide food for the group. They get taken off-course when they hear a distress signal from the original ship and there is some drama as to whether they should do this or not. The decision is made by the physicist, played by Cillian Murphy, and there is some conflict over this decision from other crew members, but not enough to keep them focused. The reason for rendezvousing with it is because they will get a second bomb, not because of the possibility of people being alive from the original crew. They encounter mostly dead crew(although one re-appears for a weird battle later), and a bomb that they can't use but they continue on towards their goal. I guess, one of the great things about this movie, is how the characters realistically are trying to achieve their goal of saving the world without following typical action-movie caricatures(which is a gigantic relief). Without giving away too much more, this is a very well done movie in the light of 2001, as far as it's pacing, and should be considered a classic in the genre. Watch it, you will be surprised and enjoy the experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, it's neither 2001: A Space Odyssey nor Alien. However, it is respectful of them, it is a tribute to them and their kind, and it does remain a rather smart, psychological and largely realistic and convincing entry in the genre of sci-fi(and thriller). Yes, in spite of what others have already pointed out, and that is, indeed, true; the first two thirds are by far the best parts of this, though I would not say that the final one is all bad or entirely without its worth. I won't give away what happens; many will be disappointed. While this has a lot of what we expect from Hollywood blockbusters, it's really just there for the ambiguity and the thought-provoking material to be allowed in... also, it seldom takes away from the overall experience, and they make it work. This is immensely exciting, tension-packed and suspenseful, whenever it goes for such. The film manages to avoid the isolation of outer space(and the small crew) affecting the audience negatively(it does cause claustrophobia, intentionally, at times), unlike the aforementioned classics. It is engaging throughout. The dialog is clever and well-delivered. Every character, their relationships with one another, the effect the situation has on them, credible, well-developed and impeccably written. The acting is amazing. There are maybe three(if that) recognizable names in the cast, and as the one that is sometimes added to a flick to increase its appeal to those who find him cool(Evans), isn't really doing the "hot and rebellious" thing, literally everyone in this is there because they have talent, and it shows. The visual style and creative editing and cinematography of Boyle is evident, and like his other work, this is gripping and has something to say(not necessarily the same thing to every viewer). Garland's skill is clear, as well. This has astonishing FX, and none of them are merely there to evoke "oohs" and "ahhs". There is quite a bit of disturbing content, some bloody violence and infrequent strong language in this. The DVD comes with 2(one with Danny, the other with a scientist) informative and interesting feature commentaries, a descriptive audio track, 38 and a half minutes of web production diaries, 19 minutes of deleted scenes including alternate ending with the option of hearing the director's reflections on them, the shorts Mole Hills(it's... different) and the animated Dad's Dead(which I will review on its own page here on the site), a theatrical trailer and a teaser. I recommend this to any fan of this type of picture and/or of those who made it, and anyone who enjoys it when this medium stirs up a debate. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what movie the person who left the last comment saw? Sunshine is in fact... wait for it... a movie. Yes that's right, somebody wrote it and it's set in the future. If you can look past nitpicking comments to do with the theoretical UNINVENTED technologies of a film set in the future. You will see a brilliant movie. Danny Boyle's direction is fresh and moving on from his previous films as always. Set and costume design were fantastic, hinting at the Russian sci fi films it's obviously nodding at, but always functional and never drawing attention away from the actors. Performances were always human with no over drawn-out emotion. Thankfully Boyle and Garland didn't try to make more comments on human madness but just put an interesting story in front of us to watch. Images were amazing and the soundtrack beautiful. --- Plus you have to agree those space suits looked so cool. And realistic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001, Meet Freddy Krueger, whether you want to or not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The voice-over narration at the very beginning tells us we're in for a "serious" science fiction film; this is going to be a film ABOUT something! We are on a large spaceship headed towards the sun, with the (rather preposterous) mission of re-fueling the star, re-starting and energizing a dying mother whose living child the Earth is closing in on an endless cold night of death.Sounds promising; science fiction films certainly haven't been known for their intellectual ambition over the past couple of decades, when action and special effects have ruled the day as 12-year-old boys are the only audience being sought. Unfortunately, the root idea of the film is really the only element of worth, as we quickly are "treated" to a story at first monotonous and predictable with a poorly-characterized group of young and pretty scientists facing internal strife and increasing difficulties in the mission, and later to one of the most ill-thought-out, ludicrous endings that I've ever seen in any film, of any budget or genre.First, the astronauts: honestly, had they not referred to each other by name quite frequently, and had they not been apparently deliberately chosen to represent a range of ethnicities and shallow emotional types, I would have had a hard time knowing who was who. We have the psychologist of indeterminate race who seems likely the most mature and calm "adult"; the sophomoric couple of scientists who actually get into two physical fights over the course of the film; the grave slightly older Asian captain; the young hottie female whose actual purpose I'm still unclear on; the middle-aged Asian woman gardener, etc. None of these characters are developed or given much of a background beyond a line or two, and most of them seem to adhere throughout to a couple of quite simple stereotypical behaviors; the two women in particular are ill-used as mostly emotional, "soft" counterpoints to the machismo on display elsewhere. Few of them seem to have the intellect or training to actually be entrusted with such a serious endeavor.As poor as the writing of the characters and motivations is, though, the plotting is even worse, and the storytelling suffers from several apparent lapses in continuity and reason. Another ship, the first ship to be sent on the mission which disappeared 7 years before is found; the decision is made to head for it despite the alteration of trajectory required; nothing wrong with that except for the ridiculous mistakes made by the navigator that surely would have been corrected by the all-seeing computer. After heroic sacrifices and a major blow to the ship's environment, we're told that half the crew will have to die for there to be enough oxygen to reach the other vessel ? following which we jump to a docking with that ship, and no explanation for the crew still being intact. I really thought a reel was missing, it was so poorly edited. Once the other ship is met, the really silly and completely unbelievable elements come into play, the film becomes a slasher pic, and I spent most of the last third of the film just laughing. I cannot fathom what the defenders of this complete abandonment of one genre for another see in it; had the film given off the SLIGHTEST evidence of being a parody or satire in it's first hour, I could maybe have tolerated it, but as it is.....the title of this comment should give you all you need to know.I guess the photography isn't bad, though the action scenes that dominate much of the last half-hour are nearly impossible to follow; and the acting wasn't incompetent, though none of it stood out in any way. So it isn't COMPLETELY worthless. It is, however, utterly disappointing, and along with the nearly-as-bad Stardust early in the year gives me plenty of reason to despair at the potential future of big-budget science fiction and fantasy.</fullReview>

I bet he gets killed in the next 10 minutes!...5 minutes later: BINGO! So in this super future they don't have backup computers, vital spaceship components are accessible to one and all and navigators do complex math on sheets of papern (and of course mess up), oh and they don't have backup oxygen tanks or contingency plans either or anything that makes sense really! A pathetic mish mash of everything you've ever seen in 2001 Sapce Odyssey + Alien + Event Horizon, etc... but very badly done.Cliché, after cliché, you KNOW everything that's going to happen before it happens.As boring as Solaris (the George Clooney version) and as pointless as Batman &amp; Robin.Want a good space movie, here's one of the rare ones: Mission to Mars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunshine is the story of the crew of the Icarus, a spaceship on a voyage to our sun. The sun is dying and Icarus carries a nuclear "payload" which will re-ignite the sun. It all sounds ridiculous, but hey - it's the future! If you can get past this, then Sunshine offers some really enjoyable aspects.The film shows how each character reacts to their situation and I found the performances to be enjoyable. The setting offers some brilliant visuals and at times is stunning. Contrasts become apparent in this film - light and dark, hot and cold, bravery and cowardice, life and death.For all of these enjoyable aspects, the ending is really silly and the film would have been much more without it. Some creative editing was needed to stop it from looking as silly as it felt (if you've seen it, you know what I mean).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stay out of the Sunshine ***Possible Spoilers***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Boyle can be great (The Beach, good (Trainspotting, 28 Days Later), and unfortunately bad (Sunshine, Life less Ordinary).There are several issues I take with Sunshine. The characters are poorly designed. While every actor here does a great job, the logic is poor. Excuse the drunk, or stalking Astronauts from recent headlines, if you have dedicated people flying into space to basically take food to a space station, then the ones going to save humanity with a payload to the sun would be far more dedicated than what we see in the movie. Instead of professionals, we get a house of arguing personalities just like on MTV's Real World. First sign there is something amiss here.Second issue is the plotting. Why would Pinbaker still be alive? Why would he not head to heaven where he believes we all belong? Why would he turn the distress signal on? There are may possible answers to this, but none that clarify his un-needed place in the story. The Icarus I and its crew, including Pinbaker are completely irrelevant. There are much better places to take this story than to Freddy Kruger.Third issue, is one that includes the other two. Generally, Sunshine had thoroughly poor logic from beginning to end. Science Fiction depends on creating a world where you at least believe the film's logic if not your own. Big failure here. Good direction, effects, and acting can't save the horrible script.In short, if you go out for this Sunshine, you'll only get burned. I know I know, but I couldn't resist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Critically acclaimed... knuckle-gnawingly tense?" HAH!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this movie on Austar. The trailer itself was stunning - the sun is dying and a group of people is sent to revive it. It was also advertised as 'critically acclaimed' and 'knuckle-gnawingly tense'. So I paid for my ticket and saw it.I liked it.For the first thirty minutes.It was going okay until when they decided to visit the Icarus I. Then when the captain of the Icarus I arrived, I was incredulous. What the heck? The Icarus I had been gone for years, the power of out, so just how did the guy stay alive for several years? With all that dust drifting around and his skin in that condition he should have died from a serious infection.Then the captain got over to the Icarus II (shouldn't the computer have alerted them to the unknown crew member?) and started killing them all. At this point I was wondering why this science fiction movie suddenly turned into a horror film.I was also sneering in my mind at the trailer - there was absolutely nothing in the trailer that suggested horror themes. I had assumed that the mission was getting plagued by system failures, which one would expect being so close to the sun. But a killer psycho captain? Pu-leeese! A lot of the scenes in the second half of the movie I had to have my eyes closed because I hate the killing aspects - that's why I hate horror films. I had a small hope that the ending would be worth not just walking out at that moment. Boy, was I wrong.The last guy alive was running from Captain Psycho and managed to deploy the bomb. Then it explodes and the wall of fire rushes towards him... and stops? Huh? That sequence didn't make sense as well.The idea of a nuclear payload restarting the sun is as ludicrous as a drop of water restarting a water fountain.The one and only redeeming good scene in the whole movie is the one where the Icarus II captain dies saving the ship. If they took the Icarus I out of the film and everyone died (if they must die) in an act of saving the ship and mission, then this would have been a reasonably good film.But turning a sci-fi movie with potential into a horror flick. VERY BAD DECISION!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like any Danny Boyle film before, the visuals are fantastic and appealing. A mixed starcast is natural, courtesy of globalisation and brainy people being discovered on all corners of this round earth. The film starts well, with the objectives clearly defined and you pretty much know what it is all about in the first few minutes. All is well and then obviously a technical goof up occurs and its taken care of...peace is restored at the cost of mission head's life...then suddenly the plot takes a twist, an irrecoverable twist from where Danny Boyle has lost it...the crew try to link with another ship and things go haywire from there. To add to the dilemma, we have a psyho, stuck in outerspace for a decade and he talks all sorts of religious gibberish. In the end one does not know if the film set out to achieve its objective of tellin us what was gonna happen. To sum it up, I would say, Danny Boyle is capable of delivering better than this.You wont miss it.cheers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing multi-genre film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off, I'm not sure where I sit on Danny Boyle's filmography. My opinion of his work is definitely largely positive, but there are a couple of his films that I'm not as enamoured with as others seem to be, most notably Trance and Slumdog Millionaire. That's the little caveat at the start of my review, since my opinion of Sunshine is overwhelmingly positive. *Spoiler* - the film manages to slickly transition between genres, from a simple SF "we need to save the world" story to a sort of mystery film to a futuristic thriller with horror elements. The film's aesthetic choices are wonderful, with the space-age interiors of the Icarus having the clean, sterile appearance expected from a spaceship, while the protective suits worn by the crew exposed to the sun are claustrophobic. Sound design is fantastic - the 'spacey' sounds of the exterior shots combine well with the clanking and groaning of the ship when it expands and contracts in the heat and cold of space. The cast was chosen well - Cillian Murphy is ideal for playing Capa, a slightly geekish, but still very human character. He's not reduced to playing the stereotype of the nerdy, socially inept, science geek; but his character is well-written and well-played. He's a human being in an inhuman environment. Pre-Captain America Chris Evans shows critics of his earlier films that he still had the potential to act decently, and Mark Strong (although starting to be typecast as the villain) is, well, just complex. Pinbacker (Strong) has clearly gone through some kind of psychological trauma, but he isn't a generic, raving lunatic. He's methodical, but still imperfect. Too often, film writers make their villains perfect in their planning, abilities, and the execution of their ill deeds. With Pinbacker, his plans have to change on the move, as things go right and wrong for him. All-in- all, this film is well written, well cast, and decently put together, so that each major development in the plot acts almost like a small nudge to the trajectory of a spacecraft - by the end, things are going terribly wrong for the remaining crew of the Icarus. The reason why I didn't give this movie 10 stars is because I wanted to give it 9,5 to deduct a small piece of a point because of a loose end. At the end of the film, we don't really need to know what happened to Capa after the last time that we see him, and we know what happens back on Earth. What bugged me the first time that I watched the movie was the lack of resolution with regards to Pinbacker. Obviously, in the long term, it doesn't matter - the Icarus II succeeded and the Earth has a Sun again. However, in that moment towards the end of the movie, when Capa leaves Cassie and Pinbacker in that anomalous space where the fuel cells for the solar bomb are, viewers are left to feel that there's no solid resolution to the tension between Capa and Pinbacker. Of course, the events that follow in the 40 seconds or so afterwards render the point moot, but in that exact moment between Capa's departure and the detonation of the bomb, you're left just a little put out by this seemingly weird ending to a fight between hero and villain. It's clear that Boyle didn't want a conventional Hollywood-style ending with the hero killing the villain, followed by some cheesy lines between the hero and his love interest about "getting to the bomb" or something, but viewers need to keep in mind that there is definitely still resolution at the end.</fullReview>

It's a very human movie. The special effects are surprisingly good. They create an enveloping atmosphere. A few scenes feel a bit contrived such as the scene with the dead/dying woman sitting in a Buddha pose with a green sprout in her hand and other scenes that drag on a little more than necessary.

The absolute worst is the Oxygen shortfall, really.... you don't have enough oxygen for 8 people, but no one thinks to maybe close off wasted space on the ship...which seems to be about the equivalent of about 30 cubic miles of ship.....not counting the atmosphere provided for the "size of a city" payload, c'mon, really? Oh, and going though open space without a pressurized suit...just some foil wrap...and you don't explode? Just a bit of frostbite on one thumb.....nice. All hell breaking loose at the end of the movie, and everyone is off all by themselves out of contact with each other...wonderful. I spent the last half hour in utter awe of the uselessness I was witnessing from supposed trained professionals. Great computer animation should not be 6/10 of a movie. The story is weak, the plausibility is so lacking it hurts, and the intelligence of the crew is beyond redemption. Derp!

Everything is by the book, including the familiar "crisis of the hour", and headache inducing visuals. The weakest point is the acting and lack of any character development. The astronauts look and act like they belong in a sitcom, rather than on a mission to save the earth. You know the acting is terrible when the spacecraft's talking computer has more personality than any of the crew. The movie comes across more like a video game than a feature film.

It was so bad I actually wanted to walk out of the cinema - the only other movie that's ever happened with was Catwoman, so you know just how bad I think Sunshine was. Suspension of disbelief is crucial to portraying a scene or a movie set in the future. Danny Boyle simply didn't bother with attempting to coerce and beguile his audience, he simply ramrodded this ridiculous plot through, and hoped it would be enough. It wasn't. Not by a long way. I'm sure I don't have to go through every last plot goof to make my point, there're far too many. Two that struck me as being rather silly centered on the ship's AI, which fails to mention the fire in hydroponics until queried and also entirely fails to warn of an intruder until Capa asks where all the damn air went. I wasn't the only one who was disappointed with this movie though, two friends who'd rented the DVD also expressed their disdain - and rather more forcefully than I have here.</fullReview>

Innovative visual effects, a great cast and a storyline that not only engages you, but also has a haunting atmosphere that is just lovely. Everything is fantastic until a screw up on such a monumental scale happens that it cannot be anything else but the studio interfering with the production. I for one have a hard time imagining that thoughtful and excellent director Danny Boyle ever intended for the amazing fleshman, Pinnbacker, the evil self-proclaimed prophet and bad rip-off of Event Horizon's Dr. Weir, to be in this film. The character is not only unnecessary, but confuses the theme of the film and takes the quality down several notches - he simply does not belong and stands out like a bad haircut from this otherwise well crafted story.. I think the studio decided that a film cannot possibly work at the box-office unless it has a good ol' bad guy - so unfortunate for a film that was good enough not too need a bad guy at all.</fullReview>

There is nothing you can take seriously, not the science, not the story, not the pacing of the action, not the character building, as they are obviously pretexts, and I see nothing coming in to replace them.

		<fullReview>Given a considerable amount of thought, the sun is certainly a beautiful thing. The closest star anyone has ever known, and the only one we will ever be so close to in our own lifetimes. It is known and shown by science to be the giver of all life and as such, appears to be living up to its status within many cultures as God. So what if this star, this bringer of all life, this eerily beautiful clump of gas began to die? What would we do? Within Sunshine, the suggested idea is that an Atom bomb the size of Manhattan Island be fired directly into the sun, so as to recreate the Big Bang and save us all. In theory it's foolproof. But something that really ensures that the audience is enticed is that throughout the film it's made obvious that it is only theoretical. There is no way to know whether or not it'd work than to try and so throughout Sunshine a very big fear stands out. Even if they succeed with their mission, it could make no difference whatsoever. The Sun could still die out, implode and destroy all of the earth and all life on it. And as well as all this, couldn't someone have thought of a more encouraging name than Icarus? Sunshine, frankly boasts what I have no shame in endorsing as the greatest use of computer generated imagery ever. Absolutely every time the sun is shown, it seems apparent that much time has been put into perfecting them. Also, these images are something that I feel has to be seen on the big screen to truly be appreciated. When that great beautiful star appears in front of you, you can't help but feel as if the light is burning away all that you are unsure of. Essentially, the Sun is standing its ground. The Sun is god. On top of everything else, the magnificent music works with the visuals in order to create a mood that cannot fail to inspire emotion. The perfect clash of exquisite images and emotional music within the a scene in which a character called Keneda 'meets the sunshine' and has made its way to the top of my great movie moments list.The cast in Sunshine is absolutely fantastic. Made up of a few general unknowns and a few A-List Hollywood stars (Cillian Murphy, Chris Evans &amp; Michelle Yeoh) but despite the differing fame status none of them let the film down. The cast itself is definitely an ensemble and it is nice to see a film not flaunt the biggest star as much as it can.It would be ridiculous to disregard the blatantly obvious themes bought up in Sunshine. The increasing necessity on machines is one that appears multiple times and given that this is a film about the Sun a more apparent idea, science vs. religion is one that is played upon heavily. Overall, the biggest problem within the film appears to be that it doesn't quite know what its message is. There are clearly quite a few but instead of letting a few stand out, it seems that many are included as fillers instead of giving the same effectiveness as the final overpowering message.Overall, with a film that can cause as much debate as this one, I think it's worth seeing just to see where you stand on the whole issue. On top of that though, it's just a really well made film. It has a great script, terrific direction, some incredible imagery and a stunning cast. The best film of the year so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worst movie i've seen in ...almost forever! it has to go in at least my bottom 5 sucky movies. it was b o r i n g. i am a sci-fi fan and went to this wanting to like it. i can look past a lot, but this movie gave me so little to look past. by the middle of the movie you are hoping for a "stellar bomb" to go off in the theater and put you out of your misery. i was first put off by the length of the film: 1 hr 47 mins. I generally like long movies. i want at least 2 hours for my bucks. turns out the length was the best part of the movie. too bad it seemed like i was stuck in there for 4 hours. no character development in this flick--no reason for you to want to see any of these people survive. special effects were pretty pedestrian for a space opera. SPOILER ALERT: and then to top it all off, at the end freddy krueger makes an appearance as the film's bad guy!!?? DON'T go to see this. It's CRAP!!! w/ a capital "C".</fullReview>

Oh, it tries for philosophical profundity, but in the end I think it was just mankind's last attempt to launch the world's seven dumbest people into the sun. Decent actors, adequate set design, horrible story and writing.I want my money back. During the second half of the film three members of the ship's crew have to jump through space without a line from a wrecked ship to their own. This incredible leap of faith taken by the crew is NOT one that should be taken by moviegoers. I want my money back, preferably before the sun goes out for real.</fullReview>

Maybe its the shining meets Alien. I am not even sure how to compare it because its not worth it. Especially with all the potential to make great movies, this one somehow makes it. Where are the smart people out there that have a brain and raise a hand and say, this is seriously the script and the premise? I went to see this with my brother and cousin and we sat in the front row and did our best to hold back the laughter at how stupid every premise was. How it so readily stole, borrowed and ruined every space cliché, every movie cliché known to man. We had to see it to believe it. After it was over we laughed out loud for quite a few minutes. Without any effort, crushed every plot hole and concept with ease. I would give this a zero out of 10 if I could have. Go see something else instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People have commented on the potential supernatural nature of the ending, the overly horror movie nature of the 3rd(?) act, the overt homage/ripoffs of other sci-fi movies, and they are all reasonable complaints, but ones that didn't particularly bother me.What did bother me immensely is the fact that the middle third of the movie advances its plot almost entirely based on smart people doing stupid things. There are numerous instances of people sacrificing themselves for no reason at all. People make hurried decisions with no apparent time pressure.The first instance is not too bad and I was willing to excuse, as they hung a lantern on it, but it's a clear indication of things to come. Trey makes a mistake. Making a mistake is not my favorite plot device, but, okay, let's go with it. (That said, no one is checking his work? We know that they're concerned about their psyches -- they have a psych officer -- and they let a single person make significant modifications without someone checking behind him? Free computer programs are written with better QA than that.)The spinning tower gets destroyed because it will rotate into the unshielded Sun. They know this. Why not stop it rotating? It doesn't appear to be generating artificial gravity -- there's gravity everywhere, and even if it is, how about dealing without it for an hour or two? There could be an explanation for this, but there's none given.Kanada sacrifices himself for no apparent reason. The shield was only minimally damaged by being misaligned, and apparently easily reparable. Why not retrieve Kanada and Capa -- they clearly had time -- put the ship back in a fully shielded position, deal with the fire, then try again. Failing that, why did Kanada not at least try to shield himself behind or under the shield fin he was repairing. (Okay, maybe he was "going to die anyway".)After the docking connection with the Icarus I fails, they decide that they can't ferry spacesuits back and forth because once they open the hatch, the air will be gone. But later, they show Searle in a pressurized section of the ship as he gets burnt. They could have gotten at least one more crewmember off safely, assuming that there was only just the one remaining sealable compartment, which seems an odd assumption. Then they decide to carry over two other members in thermal blankets and hope for the best, but it apparently didn't occur to them to strap themselves together, or stand in single file. Then they decide that they have to leave someone behind to open the hatch. How about the guy in the spacesuit who can follow after the cabin has depressurized? All the while ignoring the fact that one of the reasons they're there is to gather oxygen and plants. Yes, maybe they were rushed because of the pressure leak, but they didn't seem to be losing oxygen too fast -- they got back and left with Searle still able to function apparently normally.Then there are the two big plot holes, which I might otherwise be willing to ignore. None of these critical systems were redundant? I can go with the fact that the payload is not redundant, but no redundant computer? No redundant greenhouse? And then they say that the Icarus I's payload is useless because they can't pilot it because the computer is down. But then Capa successfully pilots the II's payload down without the computer functioning.And the reason that this is all so frustrating and I didn't give it a lower rating is that the movie, generally, doesn't treat the audience like idiots. They don't feel the need to spell out every detail; they show, don't tell, which is far too infrequent in movies these days. They even tell jokes this way, with Searle's progressive sunburn. It had such a great chance of being an excellent, near perfect, sci-fi movie, and they blew it in that 2nd act with simply lazy writing.</fullReview>

I could live with how far fetched the plot was to begin with, but then the infamous "plot twist" made absolutely no sense. Neither plot was tied together really well to form some sense of cohesion. Let alone some the lunacy and leaps of faith that were taken, like jumping from one spacecraft to another with only lining from the inside of the spacecraft. I may not be able to comprehend the artistic creativity that was suppose to be in this movie, but I know I will not be able to get back the 2 plus hours and the $8 dollars I spent to see it. I would only recommend this movie to someone if they like to waste their money on artistically crappy films which may make you hallucinate if you are paying enough attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie I've seen recently</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Contains spoilers* The basic idea of the movie, to launch a bigass bomb into the sun is just stupid. It's like old 80s movies, where the solution to everything was to nuke it. There seems to be an attempt in the movie to hit a Stanislav Lem kind of note, where the crew is made up of scientists who are smart and act based on pure reason and logic (eg. "the mission is to deliver the payload to save humanity, our lives are secondary"). This just doesn't work with the young cast and the slang script. Scientists don't say "fuck" every 2 minutes and start beating up each other every 3. Why does the captain go outside to fix the shield? He has to stay alive to complete the mission. This is not logical or reasonable. Also, why is most of the crew mentally unstable? It seems we'd send the best for such an important mission. The low-point of the movie is when the Asian guy changes the course of the ship but *forgets* to adjust the shield and all hell breaks loose. Forgets?! This goes beyond "suspension of disbelief". Then, about 2/3 of the way the movie abruptly stops attempting to be a science fiction and changes into a fiction horror: suddenly a monster comes on board and starts killing people. Unfortunately, nobody cares about the characters at this point, everybody's just waiting for the movie to finish.As science fiction, this is crud compared to 2001 (whose spacesuitless vacuumsuck scene and HAL voice is ripped right off here). For a horror movie, it doesn't have enough horror.As a final note, may I suggest that hitting the sun probably doesn't require an 8-men crew (esp. in a sci-fi future): the sun is massive, everything that comes near is sucked inward due to gravitation. Just aim in the general direction =).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was completely blown away when I watched it for the first time (in cinema back in 2007) and even more so after re-watching it a few days ago. It's haunting, I keep coming back to it, reading about it, watching with commentary etc.I love how the fascination for the sun consumes these people, how they sense that something's THERE, some sort of revelation behind its physical appearance. In alchemy sun and gold are related in many ways, in the spiritual sense because they are both an image of the same principle. Of something divine, if you will.Back then I didn't like the crazy captain story, but now, after thinking about it, my opinion has changed. He is an integral part of the story, which is told in a very symbolic way. It's basically about the conflict between god/nature and science, a conflict that each of us deals with inwardly all the time, if only subconsciously.We have science in the form of the crew and their mission. It's purely rational, we see this in their discussion about whether to go to the Icarus I, there's no place for morale, it's a purely rational way. But the closer they get to the sun they can't deny that they are about to meet something unexplainable, the other side of the coin. Something divine, the creative force that we are tied to. And something inside of them is drawn to it. Pinbacker lost himself in it, and with him the irrational aspect gains the upper hand for a while. It's not simply insanity, he's really seen something (in the deleted scenes he tells Capa that he'll find god in the sun), and it's proved by the fact that he's still alive.In the commentary Danny Boyle says when Capa is 'illuminated' in his last scene, he is sandwiched between nature/god (the light of the sun in front of him) and science (the light of the bomb behind him). He's standing between these two walls, and he lifts his hand to greet whatever he's seeing there. In the reality of a human being these two aspects are equally important, and it's through bringing them together that they can be saved.Also the characters and their interactions are so fantastic. Especially Capa and Mace, their pure strength and sacrifices for the mission impressed me immensely, and I loved how although they used to clash due to their personalities in the end there was this huge understanding between them.Amazing amazing movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is pure rubbish from beginning to end.You know the astronauts on the spaceship Discovery in '2001: A Space Odyssey'? The astronauts in this film are nothing like them. In fact, they are not even astronauts. They are a bunch of emo hippies. Who in their right mind would let this team of incompetent and emotionally unstable individuals conduct the most important mission in human history? All they do is bicker, scream, cry, even physically assault each other over trivial issues. And on top of that, they are not very bright. You'd think they would send people with PhD's on this mission. Nope. They send a bunch of guys they probably found in one of the 'safe spaces' on college campus.Then you have a plot twist that is totally unoriginal, and mirrors '2010', 'Event Horizon', and a bunch of other films. I won't even discuss it, because it is so derivative, so lazy, and so stupid, that it does not merit a discussion.Zero stars for the supposed star kick-starter.</fullReview>

Other reviewers have detailed the stupidity better than I can.For me, it really came down to the characters. If you get invested in the characters, you can forgive just about anything. In Sunshine, there was nobody I cared about in the slightest. The fate of mankind rests in the hands of an elite group of people and these are the best humanity could come up with?

		<shortDescription>This is by far the most underrated movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the movies I've ever seen, Sunshine is the one that I've watched the most because it is very 'addicting'.This is set in the future when the sun is dying out. 8 astronauts then have to go to the sun to deliver a stellar bomb in hopes of re- starting the sun. But the mission proves to be increasingly difficult.I wasn't a fan at first but this has grown on me a lot. This is a very entertaining movie. It will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. What I like about it is that it kept me engaged all throughout it. Every single one of its action sequences keeps you on the edge of your seats the entire time. The sacrifices made by the crew members are heroic and jaw-dropping. Every characters death scene is handled with care and is done superbly. The movie handles its scenes with care to make them look as good as possible. The movie has a lot of repeat watchability due to this and it adds a whole lot to this movie.I know that a lot of people complained about Pinbacker, but I disagree with you all. The movie needed something big to spice things up. It needed something to raise tension. Otherwise, the movie would've just been bland. Pinbacker brought a lot of tension to the movie and he carried it with excellence. I know that it's a drastic change of plot so I can understand why someone might not like it. However, what you have to admit is that Pinbacker was a lot better than most slasher/horror movies nowadays. Also, the final third had moving scenes too. Mays death was an amazing scene, the Capa's jump scene is tense and well-done, and the last 5 minutes is just downright beautiful.This is a really underrated movie. It deserves much more praise. I think that this is a masterpiece. I've seen a few good arguments people have been bringing up but they don't affect my opinion of this. This is one of my favorite movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really good movie that's EXTREMELY underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine is a really good sci if movie about our sun 50 years from now. The sun is dying and a crew of 7 has deliver an atomic bomb called a payload to reignite it. However things go bad and the shield protecting the ship from its harmful rays turns a little bit and causes damage. After 2 of the crew members repair the damaged areas of the shield one dies of the excessive heat from the sun. After the damage was done it caused the ship to lose oxygen, which only at this point only 4 crew members can stay with enough oxygen. Then they stop at the original ship that was supposed to do the same mission seven years before. And they discover that the deranged captain of the ship killed all of the crew members because he believed he got a message from god that it was time for humanity to die. He somehow survived because he snuck onto the second ship and killed almost all the crew members. So to conclude, Sunshine is a great film that's underrated and I hope it gets more popular as the years go by. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally don't compare movies to each other just because something in the premise might be similar. I'm also not going to rehash the plot. What I'm going to say in my review is that this was actually a very unique movie especially considering all the scientific advisers involved, an international cast because most likely in a circumstance portrayed in the movie this would be the case and since English is an International language, it was the most obvious language for the movie to represent. Personally I thought Solaris, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Silent Running were very boring movies especially 2001 which is touted. I'm a hardcore Science Fiction fan and I check out how they made the movie before reviewing. I know many on here think they are science gurus for some reason but when you read the background in the making of the movie those involved are far beyond the opinions of those who do not have the degrees and know very little about what they are talking about. They went to the trouble to give all the actors the most they could to be able to identify with the mission and the flight they would be undertaking in outer space. They also left in the human aspect. I find it odd that the billing for Rose Byrne is given such a high level because she had a very small part in the movie. Cillian Murphy and Chris Evans are the stand outs in this one. When you consider how many lectures, books they read and experiences the cast went through to make this movie, they did an exemplary job in their parts. It wasn't so much who these people were but the task at hand and how they interacted to get the job done, a more than difficult task. This was the most realistic of any I have seen regarding a problem with the sun. There always has to be an antagonist in any story to be viable beyond malfunctions. It was not surprising someone went crazy and became fanatical from a religious point of view when it became clear that their mission was futile, the first mission. Otherwise it would be just another boring space movie. It wasn't a documentary so besides the interactions of the crew from a psychological point of view, there needed to be that little bit of action to move it from boring to interesting. Just because movies cover a similar storyline, it is how they portray it. Ideas are not copyrighted and are not cliché. This word is used far too often. Just because someone got a similar idea about the sun doesn't make the movies identical. Even authors often write on the same topic but they are never portrayed exactly the same. This movie was excellent and for the hardcore science, visual effects or scifi connoisseur. The science behind the movie was rigorously watched given all those that helped make the movie. The visuals were excellent as well as the soundtrack. The ending was fitting for the movie. What more could they show but what the one character told his sister. She knew they had been successful. This is not a campy science fiction movie with joke lines thrown in but a serious movie about a calamity they are trying to fix. Yes it is a save the Earth movie and each and every crew member knows in their heart they will not be going back but they hope regardless. I think this movie is highly underrated and being reviewed by some erroneously because they didn't research the making of it first before the review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Science fiction equals fictional science, and I'm okay with suspending most disbelief in the interest of watching a sci fi film. But I can't excuse tired storytelling that at best shows us nothing unique or at worst throws pointless story details our way.I have a fairly complex formula for this, with X, representing the final score, equals:G*S------ E*P*H*IWhere G equals the number of character grunts in a film, times S which equals the number of character screams in a film, divided by E, the number of explosions, times P, the number of pointless evil entities, times H, the number of heroic deaths, times I, the number of ironic "he had it coming" deaths.So as you can see, Sunshine scored six out of 10, only scoring that high because of the stunning visuals.I do have to commend Production Designer Mark Tildesley and his crew. The sets and props were some of the best and most realistic I've seen in a film, period. There were tiny details that the average person would never notice, but I noticed that they got these little things spot on, so for someone as critical as me, that left me feeling satisfied. The film Apollo 13, based on reality, gets a score of 98 on its reality-based design, while Sunshine scores a solid 95. Impressive!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite a "sunny" title, this film is very dark and violent, not for everyone, not even all sci fi fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert (Cillian Murphy) and a crew of ten or so are on the way to the Sun in the ship Icarus II. Its the 24th century and the Sun has lost some of its power. This has made a permanent and dangerous winter on Earth. Awhile ago, Icarus I was sent to the same destination with a nuclear bomb, very large, that would jump start the Sun's power again. Yet, Earth lost contact with Icarus I and the Sun didn't change. The assumption was made that Icarus I never made it to its destination. Now, II is the Earth's last hope. Needless to say, it is a dangerous mission. This is from the harsh realities of outer space, where perils abound. The closer any object gets to the Sun, the hotter things get. Yes, II is designed to withstand this temperature change but accidents can happen. Also, humankind needs oxygen and there is none in the atmosphere beyond the heavens. If someone gets loose on a spacewalk, they will die, and so forth. Strangely, the crew finds out that near the planet Mercury, signals are coming from the lost Icarus I. The II crew wonders if it were possible for the I astronauts to still be alive, given food supplies and other factors. An argument ensues. Some want to try and rescue their fellow humans, others say its too risky. One of the navigators has to recalculate the path of II if they choose this. Alas, an error is made and it sets off a chain of horrific events for some of the crew. Will there be anyone left to complete the mission? This film, made by Danny Boyle, the wonderful director of Slumdog millionaire, will be too dark for some, myself included. It is a true horror-science fiction flick, as is Alien, for example, but the horrors come from the nature of the Universe, not from some toothy monster. Space is a hazardous place to go when the conditions are frightful for human life adapted to the earth. Accidents can and do happen, no matter what the planning. As such, it is definitely NOT FUN to watch someone die from heat, lack of oxygen, or whatever comes along. Therefore, be warned. The cast is quite wonderful, especially Murphy who was the reason this viewer chose to watch it. But, even the most intriguing thespians would take a back seat to the special effects and wonderful sets of an outer space movie. How impressive to see the Sun so "close" to view! But, again, even though the concept is brilliant, the violence precludes it from being "universally" recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, this review will contain a lot of spoilers I guess. Due to recent increase in space movies focusing on the difficulties and psychological transitions of the space crew, I wanted to check this movie out seeing that the rating is also relatively high.But come on, the movie starts good okay. You think yeah there is a plot and things will go wrong of course, but how wrong is the question. They decide to take an impossible and stupid mission by delaying their own mission to go to the SUN. You are going to the SUN come on, how can you believe that on this type of a journey, you can change your route? So, the beginning of the film already gives you the opinion - oh they are gonna be in real trouble due to their stupidness.Indeed, they are. The characteristic features are overrated - like the woman holding the last piece of plant etc. You can't feel what the characters feel - like in Europa Report for example. And after-wards the movie turns out into a completely different phase with inclusion of a monster or whatever that has been living in outer space for a long time. The movie becomes a horror-like one and you already lose the pace and want it to finish.So for me, if you are a sci-fi lover please don't watch that movie. I gave 2 stars for the sake of the work of designers doing the space scenes. Nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good job by director and some actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Boyle deserves credit for doing an excellent job in this movie. In my opinion the strongest actor of all was Cliff Curtis as Searle. Other characters I enjoyed were Mace and Kaneda. It seems that Mace was always the only one solving problems and fighting cold, from start to finish. Capa was overrated and Trey hardly did anything more than say "I f****d up". Cassie was just another pretty girl in a sci-fi movie. Cory's only contribution was checking oxygen levels. Kaneda's death initiated tragedy. Harvey was only required twice, once when he found Icarus I, and next when he revealed the human issue of survival when only one spacesuit is available for three people.At first I was surprised by how young most of the crew looked. In reality, for a mission this important, Astronauts would be in their 40s and would have multiple skills. There are many other plot holes:1. Mace volunteers Capa for a dangerous mission but later gives him the only spacesuit because nobody else bothered to learn to operate the bomb2. If the two spaceships were docked and each carried a payload of the mass of Manhattan (estimated to be 823 x 10^9 tonnes), gravitational attraction involving the proximity of both spaceships, sun, and mercury nearby would cause too many complications for them to remain docked for as long as they did anyway.3. A mission this size and importance would have at least a backup computer4. As pointed out by another reviewer, when Capa asks for "full sunlight!" on Pinbacker, it doesn't vaporize the guy. However it is implied that Searle died on the Icarus I when the shield moved away5. The shield is given too much importance. A heat shield can protect you when entering a cold atmosphere like the earth's because in that case heat is produced through friction. The sun's atmosphere (if we can call it that) is different. If anything, a solar flare can wrap around and destroy everything, and that being said how does the payload's gravity and air pressure continue to work properly in the end? Yes its true that due to the sun's gravity things would happen much slowly, but still, I had a few "aw, come on" moments.6. Since Pinbacker knew his ship was Icarus I, he was aware that Icarus II was being built. Therefore computers on both ships (or at least Icarus II) should know about each other's crew (or a pool of astronauts). But they don't, so there is an unidentified "fifth" crew member.7. As another reviewer pointed out, fire extinguishers were absent. I myself feel the fire shouldn't have even occurred as an explosion because if its an oxygen producing garden, there is also CO2 present.8. Both Mercury and Icarus-I make similar "space music", or at least it wasn't detected properly.9. Pinbacker really spoiled the movie for me. Why is he so powerful and has not developed infections if his skin has peeled off? How does he eat and excrete? I've read complaints about how the physics or astronomy (e.g. stars when the screen was down) wasn't right but you have to remember that this movie revolves around an "idea" and its execution. All in all, good job. I rate this movie 6 out of 10 because its full of more "plot technicalities" than character development.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this was a good movie, however there was one thing about it that i didn't understand. I the big mirror was to keep them safe from the rays of the sun and they got rid of it when they released the payload how are the going to get home. The plan was always to drop off the bomb and return home but if part of the mission is to shoot the large part of the ship into the sun them they have no protection for the return trip. All and all I did like this movie and i have told many people about it. I thought that it was a good story and the acting was adiquit. The Visuals were good and not over done of fake looking. I would like to see more movies like this in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scientific inaccuracies aside (because it actually IS a movie), The cinematography, the dialogue, each nuance, the moral conflicts, the beautiful score, its as close to perfect as any move I've ever watched.I have only watched a few movies more then once, but I've watched this movie more then 15 times always picking up something new. This is the only movie to have actually affected my life, helped me out in times of need and picked me up when I was down.The repercussions of failure, the interactions between each character and the final conflict of playing God or willfully changing our destiny seriously struck me with emotion no move has elicited from me before.Any and every person should experience this movie just once in their lifetime. It is that important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise of this pompous Sci-Fi fable is as preposterous as the science that's supposed to support it. Fifty years in the future the sun is dying, dooming humanity to frozen extinction - unless a group of 30-something airhead astronauts can resuscitate our fading star with an implausible stellar bomb.After setting off in their spaceship, the robotic script forces the witless crew to wade through a series of puerile squabbles, technical screw-ups and vacuous airlock antics until the standard menu of space travel capers is exhausted. In between these tepid thrills, the cardboard cut-out characters exchange tense looks and babble scientific gobbledygook as they try to make this stale stew believable. With failure staring them in the face, a chance meeting with a previous mission's space vehicle offers a final opportunity to save mankind. Unfortunately it also triggers a sequence which properly belongs in a gore-fest horror movie. After this lunacy, nothing can prevent the film's descent into overheated melodrama and a damp squib climax. By the time the titles roll, the brains of Sunshine's audience have been burnt to a crisp by its relentless stupidity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The graphics in this film are well done and it is a pretty thing to look at all those fantastic colors. Good sound effects and the music is decent. A lot of the sound track will remind you of the ending of The Beatles "A Day in the Life".Other than that, Sunshine is a confused mess. The story takes place in the future, and the Sun is dying. A crew (nothing futuristic about them) are sent with a mega bomb to reboot it. They come upon a another ship that failed to reboot the sun 7 years earlier. They debate on whether to divert from their own mission to check out the ship. In the end, they decide that two bombs are better than one and investigate the disabled ship. They find the crew of that ship dead and also discover quickly that the spacecraft had been sabotaged and it's payload rendered useless. Well, they make it back to their own ship (not all of them) and their supercomputer (not at all like GERTY from "Moon" or HAL 9000 from "2001: A Space Odyssey" - this supercomputer just sounds like a woman over an intercom) informs them they have an UNINVITED GUEST. This guest turns out to be a slimy naked guy from one of the crew of the other ship, and is determined to sabotage the mission.Our heroes die one after another and it's difficult to know exactly who dies when but it doesn't matter. They are all incinerated in the end.It is a dumb movie with bad acting that is pretty to look at, and because of that - I give it 4 points out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really didn't know what to make of this movie. It certainly contains many excellent elements:* An end-of-the-world, last-chance-to-save-mankind plot. * Painful moral dilemmas - is it right to kill one person to save everyone else? * Epic, visionary special effects. * An 'Alien' style ensemble cast who get picked off one by one. * The Gothic horror of an 'Event Horizon.'It should be the perfect epic Sci-Fi film! But it's not. Unfortunately, by trying to do too many things it didn't do any of them very well.The characters are very poorly developed, so you don't particularly care or even notice when they get killed. The deep moral questions are swept aside with banal platitudes. And the appearance of Pinbacker, the sun-scarred insane veteran of the first mission, feels absurd rather than terrifying.I've given this 6/10 because despite its failings, this movie has huge ambition and does deliver in parts. It just doesn't come together as a coherent whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic journey to save the sun, brings with it all sorts of baggage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I revisited Sunshine recently for the first time since seeing it at the cinema upon its release. I remember the first time round I was very excited to watch it, as the trailer sold the movie superbly for me (in part thanks to Clint Mansell's 'Lux Aeterna', never fails). But also because I always love a well made, convincing, science fiction film, as they are very rare. Sci-fi is such a difficult genre to tackle, that failure is always imminent, but when a director does get it right, it has the potential to be awe-inspiring.On first viewing Sunshine, at about half to three quarters of way through, it had done everything completely right. It really couldn't put a foot wrong. Then out of nowhere, it did. But up until that point this was a science fiction masterpiece, only to be let down at the final hurdle. But regardless, it was still so impressive, I always had the desire to re-watch it, with a more open mind, and give it another try. On second viewing I still enjoyed it like the first time, and even more. It obviously helped to know that the film was going to hit a speed bump of sorts, going into the final act. But aside from dwelling on that, the second viewing gave me a real chance to witness the brilliance of this film again, and delve deeper into the mechanics of how it is one of the best sci-fi movies in recent times.The special effects are very convincing and lovely to gaze upon. From the invigorating yet menacing sun, to the ship's exterior, and its impenetrable hi-tech shield. The interior of the ship ticks all the boxes for a good sci-fi, with contrasting rooms, from the hydrogen garden, to the rec room, and the out of this world payload. The cinematography introduces it all in such a special way. In some instances we are taken back to the opening of Ridley Scott's 'Alien', with slow tracking shots, letting the walls breathe, without a character's actions or dialogue to break the moment. All this sets up the atmosphere nicely, and shows the isolation of being so far out in space. Adding to this atmosphere is a great score, and an intriguing sound design. I particularly loved the sound composition used for the signal from Icarus 1. So incidental, but carrying so much meaning and consequence for the mission. It's almost like every tone, every beep of the signal, carries a whole new range of questions and considerations.Something I also noticed on second viewing, and quickly became a redeeming feature of the third act, was a directing masterstroke. As is mentioned in the film, when reaching the surface of the sun, the gravitational pull and velocity of the ship, will subsequently mean time and space will no longer make any coherent sense. They basically will be twisted, turned, changed, so they are not even a slight representation of their former self. In the film, this is craftily depicted visually through the distortion and skewing of the picture's aspect (ie. space), and with still frames and incoherent jump cuts (ie. time). It's so rewarding as a viewer when a director makes a conscious technical decision that breaks down normal conventions, in order to creatively symbolise part of the story. It really does take a film's aesthetic qualities along with depth of meaning, to an entirely different level. I also along with this, can't help but mention the genius in reversing the playback of the 20th Century Fox insignia at the opening of the film. Not only creative, but I don't think I have ever been hooked into a film so quickly after that final trumpet note is silenced. The immersion was instant! Over and above the special effects and technical expertise of this film, I felt the representation of a vast divide between the character's personalities, professions, agendas, and morals, was the true success of this film. It's the foundation of what makes it such an intense and enthralling experience. This conflict of interests is carefully played out, and so engaging, that you feel compelled to consider your point of view, or take the side of someone's on screen. In a film with such scope to its ideas and narrative, a clash between primal instinct and human nature becomes the centerpiece. Watching it all unfold is pure entertainment with intellect.I would definitely recommend this film as I rate it very highly. Sure it has its flaws, or more so flaw, but it is very easy to fall into the trap of passing quick judgment. I think after a repeat viewing, one can see some merit in the third act, and see the film as a whole. This is an intense science fiction thriller that really does not let up. It's a film that should define the genre for years to come. Who knows when the next chance will come to explore the unknown outer regions of space, through such a thought provoking, and highly entertaining piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed bag of Science and pure Existential "Art"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has very nice trappings of Science and SciFi. Very business like procedures and analysis of issues (mostly). The set and effects are superb. Rated 7 but it could have been so much more with some improvement in writing. Unfortunately the film is a wolf in sheep's clothing. As Science Fiction the film has several key underlying science fallacies and a psycho existential drama element that just doesn't fit the "Mission parameters". All introduced on purpose I bet. In this case "artistic license" is another way of saying "not a brilliant writer" when weaving the handful of good ideas and a good sense of mission related dialog into a whole tale. But I am betting the writer and director's main intent was a story of existential philosophy turned to horror (or maybe the horror of existence) which just happens to occur in a futuristic crisis scenario. As such Artsy people of the Green Peace "let all creatures and humans live or die together" turn of mind may find the film quite uplifting (no one left out like in elementary school games I guess). You got to "love" (NOT) how the film starts by treating the sun as a gas heater with a pilot light that has gone out. Restarting a star? A silly proposition at best since stars die due to being low on ready fuel (usually when their gravity exceeds their rate of fusion). Maybe if the film had at least proposed a fusion bomb it might not be as revoltingly lame at its foundation. But fission did lend itself to the plot artifice of having only two chances &amp; no more nuclear bomb threat on earth afterward if they work -- rainbows and ponies galore.Why do the two huge awkward "one shot" ships have the ability to dock with each other when launched 7 years apart? A small shuttle would have made a lot more sense and made repairs easier and less hazardous. Oh that's why not -- more opportunity for dramatic problems.Why don't the radio towers have retraction or ejection mechanisms? I gathered that it was reflections from their stubs that set the fire. I figure that the option to rotate would have been examined even if only 1% likely to occur. Plus retraction options make for easier repair and start resolving the question of "oh what happens when you drop the bomb attached heat shield to fly away?" Oh a quick dip in liquid nitrogen? Hee Hee much stupider than the guys freezing in space. You really will freeze in seconds in supercomputer coolant -- even if it isn't liquid nitrogen (it frosted hand in 3 seconds earlier). Plus either the supercomputer sets its circuits to "safe mode" or it burns up in seconds. You don't have minutes to recognize the problem and fix it. If the writer wanted a crisis he should have had a time critical course correction or fuel being jettisoned or similar. Of course that didn't fit with concept of the Sun God High Priest putting the ships in permanent orbit as temples.And the hydroponics garden is much too small for eight people. Plus you'd think there might be some concept of compartmentalization and separation for accidents. Its not like the US and Russia never cooked astronauts. You only have several miles of ship to spread living quarters, life support and other area across. And even brings the issue up of only having 8 crew when so much depends and apparently all competent workers are half-psycho. I figure there would be 5 psychologists and 20 men at arms just to find and eject the crazies as excess cargo, at least based on the film. But lets be real, in a crew of 8 just 1 clever crazy could have his way in a single move (eject or blow up bomb now). All this picking off crew and critical systems one at time is pure unnecessary Hollywood horror claptrap.The underlying philosophical question of the movie sparks the final crisis. The question "shouldn't we just accept death and die together peacefully -- rather than engage in undignified resistance to the obvious will of God and have some live at the expense of the death of others?" This idea is most personified by the Captain of Icarus #1, who sees himself as High Priest in charge of preserving the dignity of the dying Sun God and best able to commune the meaning of mankind by becoming its last representative. You'd think that weeding out people who might succumb to such megalomania under stress would be a #1 imperative for a mission to save mankind -- to the point of sending chimps if necessary.The whole 16 months equals psychotic behavior is overworked Hollywood plot. These people are shown as having a lot more space than submariners. Reference some other reviews: Actually gold "lame" is the preferred solar reflector due to reflectivity rivaling silver, flexibility plus its ability to be worked thin without tiny pinhole imperfections of other metals. Visit NASA pictorials of long life, high dollar satellites. Other materials are used where shorter mission lives make second best acceptable.People in vacuum wouldn't explode into pieces, but they would quickly (&lt;1 minute) spout boiling blood foam from nose, eyes, and ruptured lung sacs -- long before freezing stiff (hours if not in contact with a cold object). You might get a little surface frost depending on evaporation rate of liquids, again a matter of hours to freeze dry.Lesser Evils: The payload is not spinning. So although crew modules are on rotating shaft, scenes near airlocks should be free fall and magnetic boots as should the payload area.Quality of film versus the costs? Well start by having no big name actors and reducing the overpriced Hollywood unions.</fullReview>

So a team of scientists,mechanics etc go into space to drop a bomb into the sun to reignite it. But run along some trouble as they hear a distress signal from the original craft that failed it's mission 7 years prior. But disaster after disaster occurs until it builds up to it's nail-biting conclusion.The special effects were amazing, the acting was all very good. Cillian Murphey was the second best actor out of the film with the stand out performance from believe it or not Chris Evans.Danny Boyle has returned with a more epic sized movie. It's a big leap from drug users in Scotland to sci-fi thriller.But trust me sunshine is proof that Danny Boyle owns all generes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seems like a lot of money spent on the special effects for this movie; what a shame as the story is highly confusing, gets worse as the picture progresses, not helped by a group of weakish actors and actresses. A space craft is sent to save the earth by bombing our dying sun to get it shining to save our world. Hmmm...... The crew are the most boring and unattractive imaginable. The lead actor is a wimp and much of the time the film maker has provided us with an uneven and garbled drama and a script which is unrealistic.Seems the film is mostly for the self indulgence of the director rather than for the benefit of the viewer. If our planet was really in dire straits surely we earthlings could pick a better bunch of astronauts to save us?! And the climax is all over the place and telegraphed near the start of the play. For some reasonable effects and quite good music the best I can do is: 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as hokey as "Supernova."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very excited about the advent of this film. I finally saw it last night on DVD. As a scientist, I found the film both disappointing and encouraging. *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** The movie is disappointing because the science of the film is flimsy at best. 1)Sometimes when you're in a space suit and solar radiation hits you, you're incinerated but, later in the movie, a character can shoot between two separated spacecraft sections with the sun shining on him and survive. 2) The whole surviving space exposure without a space suit, perhaps best (and most realistically) done in "2001: A Space Odyssey" when Dave Bowman has a suit but no helmet and has to blow himself into the Discovery. Pressure differentials and extreme temperature deltas should be considered. I honestly don't know what would happen in such a case, only that the exploding miner in the leaky suit from "Outland" seems to be a lot more physically accurate of what would occur. 3) The marooned and wacky human astronaut going crazy and turning into a solar demon is a complete farce. No explanation is given (and trust me, one is needed) for how the transformation occurs. 4) Why not just fire a colossal missile through space? The fission reaction could be activated based on temperature or proximity to the sun. 5) No explanation for why the sun has burned out. 6) There's constant discussion in the movie about who's more important to the mission. Frankly, I think most everyone on board would be cross-trained, especially when it came to activating the solar nuke. Besides, at the end of the movie, the guy punches a few buttons and plugs in a connector or two. Gee, that's hard. I'm just a pilot, not a nuclear munitions expert. I can't work that elaborate doohickey you've got back there. . . . The film is encouraging because it gives us all hope as screenwriters, directors, producers, readers and agents. If "Sunshine" can make it to the screen, anything we bang out on a typewriter can make it, too. It pains me to write this, big Danny Boyle and Alex Garland fan that I am. See "Shallow Grave," "Trainspotting," "28 Days Later" or "The Beach" instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted that it might have been better to see it in the theatres to fully appreciate the effects that everyone is going mad for, in my opinion "Sunshine" was completely overrated. I rented the movie from Blockbuster and found that I couldn't really get into the movie from the start. I continued watching however, thinking that my inability to really understand the characters properly would fade as the movie progresses. I was wrong. I found that the characters were very underdeveloped - this was made most clear when they started to die and I didn't even care. Not even the dramatic Classical music made me care. The imagery that it's so famous for is kind of repetitive,constantly showing the blazing planet over and over again. It also left me with a bunch of questions: -I don't see why that crazy God guy would survive for that long, being that burnt and still have the energy to kill anyone.-If you have golden sun suits to go outside the ship - why not have a suit that can handle antifreeze so he could fix the ship without freezing to death? -How can that one little growth possibly survive the fire, when everything around it is nothing but ashes? There are of course many others I have but I won't get into because it will turn into an essay. I give it 3 out of 10 because there is a chance that seeing it in a theatre might have made a small difference.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoilers up ahead* This film is spectacular. It just takes your breath away. You immediately get sucked into it and forget about everything else around you. I saw this film twice in the space of two days and just loved it. I understood it a lot more the second time, because the first obviously I wasn't really concentrating, I was just waiting to see what happened next. The cast are so good, they chose the perfect actors and actresses, everything was perfect, the casting couldn't have been better.The storyline is simple, yet brilliant. I loved the different character personalities, how you get a sense of who each one is from the very first scene. I really like the relationships between them too. Some scenes in this film just stand out for me, because they bring on a strong emotion. *Major spoilers ahead* Scenes such as Cappa's jump from ship to payload was beautiful and the scene when Mace found Trey was one of the saddest things I've ever seen. In most films that is like this one, the characters usually get killed off one by one in their own unique way and this one is no exception. The deaths are so varied and each have their own emotion to them. One of my favourite scenes, and it is hard to pick a favourite, was when Cappa, Mace and Harvey jumped from Icarus one to Icarus 2 and for some reason I loved it when Cappa grabbed hold of Mace and threw him into the airlock, it just seemed a very close friendship when that happened, even though they had fought in the past.This film has everything; suspense, action, even small bits of scariness and, even though it's a very limited supply but it's there, of humour. I think I found about two lines, both said by Mace, which did make me grin.Another thing I loved was the unique camera work. There were images of flashing smiling faces and the first time it happens it's a bit like "what the hell was that?" and I love the camera work towards the end with the shakiness and the freeze frames. It adds a bit more chaos to the situations. I didn't think I would be able to cope with this film, I've never been good with deaths, but it is totally worth the watch. Aftwerwards I just sat in silence, taking it all in.Highly recommended, absolutely fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>++++SMALL SPOILERS+++++ Have people who are crowning this film as such actually seen Alien? The only two things they have in common are 1 bloody great spaceship 2 slow start which builds as the wheels begin to fall of.Daft comparisons aside, this is a superb stab at a psychological sci fi and one of the few movies in recent years that is made for cinema. The look and feel generated by the visuals and pace of the action I think would be wasted on DVD/whatever home medium. It is not that the film is groundbreaking in the scenes generated technically (2001 was working on a comparable imagery and scale 30+ years ago) it is the effective way that humanity vs the sun is portrayed that makes this film so inspiring. The fact that it sustains us and yet could destroy us utterly has so many god like sidelines it makes a bmovie doomsday plot - which is what it is at heart - take on a very serious and deep tone. The god concept is followed more in the film, but enough said about that.Unlike alien, the terror comes from the human elements and the battle for survival that the film unleashes upon the viewer. I found my self expecting some half arsed subplot about alien contact turning into the heart of the movie, but gladly that temptation never even saw line one in this film - the villains and heroes are convincingly human.The cast is good - Cillian Murphy giving a solid turn. The only gripes with film is that in places the story boils down to action movie clichés - the line 'finish it' appears at least once. More could have been made of the dead bits in the movie - but this may have detracted from the main dramatic scenes - and they are pretty damn dramatic. A greatly underrated film that manages to be thought provoking and 'rollercoastering' - not perfect, but if you are going to see it, see it on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've got to say right off the bat that this is one of my favorite films to come out in recent years. I think it's an almost perfect film. The film had a science adviser and it shows as it's a very intelligent film. The Danny Boyle films I've seen have been good, but I think this one is his best so far. It's another film that is beautifully shot. Every frame is just oozing with vibrant colors and Boyle's style bleeds through in every scene. Cillian Murphy is impressive, as always. He's another actor I feel deserves more credit than he's given as he impresses me more and more as his talent seems to shine that much brighter in each film he's involved with. Chris Evans was the actor who was surprising in this. It's not a role you'd expect to see him in after seeing him in films like Not Another Teen Movie and Fantastic Four. He's in top form though and he slides into this role in ease. This is also one of the few films where the soundtrack is really enjoyable, as well. When a soundtrack enhances the movie experience instead of taking away from it, it only makes the film that much better. This is one of those soundtracks.As great as the film is, it's greatest strength is its biggest flaw. They did have a science adviser and it helps make the film more believable, more intelligent, etc. The things that were changed to add suspense or for whatever reason other than to make the film more believable or as factual as possible make the film seem a little far fetched at times. It's really only a minor nitpick and it doesn't take away from how superb this movie really is.Sunshine is a film any science fiction or horror fan should see. It's mostly a science fiction film, but the last half or so is pure horror. There's definitely an Event Horizon feel to this film. It's an interesting formula that pays off pretty well in the end. The film looks fantastic as every shot seems to jump off the screen in vibrant color. It's very well written and pretty believable (given the circumstances). The acting is top notch and it's a film that comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

It was uncomfortable and not necessary.The plot line was incoherent, and it simply doesn't make any sense. For example, the choices the crew members made, how the director (or the story itself) had a terrible grasp of the technology.The last 1/2 of the movie doesn't make much sense to me. (In the end, when Capa was in the cube with the warheads, you notice the cube was spinning, but Capa wasn't affected a bit by the movement of the cube. There are way too many inconsistencies.) I know the director tried to make something new; after all stories about space ship, sun, nuclear weapon and sacrifice, cowardice are made again and again.However, techniques like: shaking the cameras from time to time, making blurring shot, or inserting horror pictures several seconds at a time doesn't make the movie original.I wasted 2 hours to watch this movie from cable.

Although I don't do written reviews, I think the unsuspecting public needs to be warned to stay away from this turkey. The movie studio must actually pay people to say flattering things about "Sunshine," in order to recoup some of its investment through video sales and rentals.If you like a different disaster coming at you every ten minutes, a far-fetched plot about jump-starting the sun before it peters out, then this is the movie for you. For all the talk about the film's spirituality, I felt absolutely nothing but the deep coldness of space. The special effects weren't particularly flashy or interesting, and the acting wasn't much better. With its poor writing, you can't fault the actors since they didn't have much dialogue to work with. The only novelty in the movie was that half the cast is Asian, including the ship's captain, and not surprisingly you knew he was going to be the first person killed off. Maybe "Alien" began that whole demise from the top-down approach. Good science fiction movies are rare, and "Sunshine" demonstrates this fact with its failure to produce any memorable moments on screen. I never saw the movie when it was released and it's a good possibility that it went straight into DVD rentals, or at least it should have. I can't imagine paying for a movie ticket, sitting in a theater and actually watching this drivel. Truthfully, I lost my patience with the movie after an hour and started fast-forwarding some scenes. Yes, it was that bad. At one point I saw a dead character come back as some sort of monster, and by then I was really fed up with it. I had no inclination to replay the video to understand this development. By the end, the movie had already completely wasted several minutes of my life and I felt cruelly cheated and wanted them back. Beware: Don't let this happen to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sci-fi it's not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the people ooh-ing and aah-ing about what a wonderful sci-fi movie this is, miss the point entirely. Sci-fi is short for science fiction, but science there isn't any in the plot. I read that they hired a physicist as an adviser. He must have been a physicist of the flat-earth type, if any of his advice has ended up in the film. This movie doesn't deserve even a single star. If it were possible, I'd give it negative stars. This is one more example of Hollywood creating its own reality. Nothing wrong with that per se, but it starts to get worrying when large segments of the hopelessly undereducated American public start to believe stuff like this, which they will, because it's about the only media exposure to "science" that they get. One might start to think it's a conspiracy to keep 'em dumb ;-)</fullReview>

Make up your own mind as you always should. I'm just telling you what i thought. I didn't like it.If you want a "people going crazy on a spaceship" movie, try the Soderberg version of Solaris which is amazing (can't speak for the original that i haven't seen yet, though i hear that's very good too). Even give Event Horizon a look - it's far better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE worst of all time!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this is crap I haven't seen a long time. Maybe because I was expecting a big hit considering the quality of "28 Later" and "Trainspotting". To me, this is just the cause of sci-fi genre is considered second grade genre, or explicitly - not to achieve goals as other genres can, and I'm not talking about sales. Story begins with great tension, but as the movie goes it becomes such a cliché which I was certain it would avoid. OK, the actors got a education of what is to be an astronaut so everything was going to be realistic, but then passion, madness and pathetic slips in. How realistic is that one of the other crew members becomes a monster. Literally!!! IT is immune to 30000 degrees, it can see even in the dark, it doesn't eat, and mind that it is sabotageur (which is perfectly fine) - it is ill person talking to God himself and his zealot. Killer in space! Hah, a parody isn't it. I wonder how he got into a position to be a NASA captain. Beside the plot, realism is conflicted with ridiculous things all the time. Icarus has a shield to protect it from the sun beams, and all you can say to this is WOW! But what about gravity??? Even in the end, in that comic cube falling into the sun gravity is unbelievably everywhere. Air too! Now Star Trek has a canon and you can respect it, but what the f*** is explanation here??? And please, please, stop making all that sound in space! There is no sound in it. There's no air to conduct it! And you don't need engine to travel, just to speed up/or down. What will stop you or slow you down once you achieve desired velocity?After all suspension thriller in cosmos - not bloody likely, Earth is perfectly good for that kind if movie. Watch it if you really don't know what to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "greatest movie to become a cinematic flop of all time", perhaps?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kudos to Alex Garland, Andrew Macdonald and Danny Boyle for this one; to have made a science fiction film with such striking visuals, competent acting and well-captured tension throughout on a modest $40 million budget should be commended greatly. Which makes the fact that its overall box office gross fell short of that budget by $8 million so much more of a shame. This movie was undoubtedly a flop, but never have I seen a film to be undeservedly given such a title as much as this one.This has all the makings of a great film: an experienced director, an original and fitting soundtrack and excellent computer graphics not being shoved in the face of the viewers to name but a few of the attributes this film has going for it. I'm not calling it perfect by any means. It definitely has its share of minor let-downs and flaws (naming none of them, as this is a spoiler-free review).While watching "Sunshine" (and whilst musing over it once it had ended) I could not help but be somewhat reminded of "Interstellar". Interesting, seeing as "Interstellar" came out seven years after "Sunshine" and Christopher Nolan does not credit Sunshine as being part of his inspiration for his 2014 hit. I'd even say it is what "Interstellar" would have been if it were dumbed down less (yes, I meant less). No disrespect to "Interstellar" of course. I'd still give that movie an eight-star score as well.When trying to come up with a score out of ten for this movie I was, for a little while, split between seven stars and eight, but decided on eight when I saw IMDb advertising a 7.3 star score for "Sunshine", causing it to rank significantly lower than other much lazier, much less interesting, much much sh*ttier movies. I firmly believe "Sunshine" deserves higher. Not based on how I would actually rate the whole movie, but on how other IMDb users would rate a movie like this. Seriously, the way some user reviews dictate the supposed quality of films on this site it's as though people give ten stars to films they just like and between one and three stars to films that weren't to their taste. Stop being so binary and have a bit of consideration for the whole movie before you decide to give movies like "The Hunger Games" ten f*cking stars. That's the sort of rating you'd give to a flawless movie, not a "marginally- above-average, teenager-catering, money-grabbing flick. Are you seriously implying that a film like "Citizen Kane" or "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" is of the same rank as some piece of sh*t like "Avatar". And why do "Gandhi" and "Deathly Hallows: Part II" have the same rating?!But I'm getting off-topic.Overall, well worth a watch for science fiction fans in particular. I'd recommend "Sunshine" to any fan of "2001: A Space Odyssey" (and "Interstellar", *sigh*). Maybe don't expect a film of the same calibre as those two, but perhaps watch it just to be dumb-founded as to why it was so unsuccessful in cinemas.Ah, well. It's not like Danny Boyle isn't already f*ckin' minted...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a great fan of Danny Boyle ( God I hate SDM).This is surprisingly an amazing movie from him. The concept as such is a spectacular one. A crew goes to sun to re-ignite it the mega bomb used up all fossil resources of planet earth. Previous project failed. So this the last chance.Now, the drama and everything that happens among crew for crucial decisions is fine but it gets lot cheesier when Pinbacker from last mission shows up and goes crazy. This has totally killed the otherwise an amazing film.And this scientifically absurd. Of course you watch like you are watching fiction but com'on the least you can do to space fictions pay little attention to gravity. Even the shots inside the payload that separates from Incrus were like shots in any dome stadium.Overall its definitely a great attempt and must watch.</fullReview>

All I could see is dark, some parts of the spaceship and the Sun. Oh and some facial expressions of the crew members!SPOILERS AHEADWhen talking about scientific inaccuracies, the list could be infinite: - There as a man with severe burns, literally 99% of his body, and he is able to function better than most of the people on board. - Even when they approached the Sun far too much, they didn't seem to burn when the two astronauts got in touch with the outer space. Ha, who would've said! - Apparently entering an abandoned ship is as safe as it could get, with it lacking oxygen and compression. But when they approached the Sun, Capa was all fine without his suit.I am really disappointed in this movie and it was quite boring. The end is stretched, the plot is unclear and the photography could've been far, far better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some names in this cast (Murphy, Yeoh), but back in '07, I came away from "Sunshine" thinking Chris Evans was the standout. He just seemed to pop among the other generic characters. And that's still true today. "Sunshine" is a visual feast, between the power of the Sun and the use of lens flares, it's nice to look at. And it makes for some intense sci-fi with the unbelievable pressure on this crew's shoulders. For most of its runtime, it's top-shelf stuff.Until the last 30 minutes or so.I always hear this movie compared (unflatteringly) to "Event Horizon", and it's an apt comparison. It sets off as some science fiction you can sink your teeth into, and then devolves into over-the-top horror movie.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clean The Lens and Turn Off The Earthquake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:This movie has a feature that you will never see elsewhere and it is not a good one. Three quarters through the movie Boyle decides to change the film into a Friday the 13th serial killer on the loose but that is not the worst part. He decides to blur his lens and shake the camera as if a massive earthquake is occurring. Forgive me, it is what the world looks like if you have had about 12 beers on an empty stomach. It is so exasperating trying to figure out what the hell is happening. Usually fanatic boy perforates someone, like tree hugger Michelle Yeoh, behind her we see his image all blurry. The worst are his scenes with Cappa where we need to figure out who is doing what to whom and it is like looking through your grandma's bi focals good freaking luck. I cannot warn people who have never seen this incredibly depressing movie that Boyle puts this crap all the way to the climax. See, this really irritates people, we have suffered the movie that is one gloomy, relentlessly grim trip into one after another of the crew bite it one way or the other. It features a scene where they vote on killing the guy who screwed the shield readjustment up and ended up cooking the captain Kaneda. Trey has a breakdown, they have to sedate him.When you watch this really sad, depressing stuff and then Boyle decides to fog up the lens and put a trampoline under the camera dolly; sorry, it really got me angry. I was with him up to this point. They go explore Icarus 1 to find out what happened, Christian Fanatic Boy gets on board, starts killing the crew one by one and Boyle goes bananas with the focus and the stability. What is Pinbacker chasing Boyle? Is he afraid of him? Why is there an earthquake and an orgasm on the lens? Hey, my whole living room was filled with a group of angry people. Imagine watching the last half, the climax, of 2001 through a shaky, foggy camera? The other flaw is that the film is relentlessly depressing, grim and nihilistic. If you are looking for that save humanity spirit of corny but entertaining Armageddon: boy, do you have the wrong movie. Do not watch it. The crew have the spirit of people taking numbers for their turn at the hangman. Cappa and Buzz cut boy fight pretty much the whole movie, at each other's throats; this is supposed to depict what happens due to being cramped up so long. The problem is when you mix in a group of people who are none too fond of each other, look about as enthused about saving humanity as I would be, plus throw in a depressing tone: you have one ugly nihilistic picture. Look, Armageddon was silly but could we not have it so freaking dark and depressing? Even with these many flaws, it could have been a passable Science Fiction except for the last half hour with Vaseline lens and earthquake camera. I have to admit to people who rated this higher; I may have gotten so angry at Boyle, yelling things at my screen, that I am biased against the movie. He is trying to say something about the Light and something in there, who knows, maybe a pizza? Who gives a crap? Earthquake boy, please concentrate on letting us see what the crap is going on then we'll talk metaphysics, OK. Only watch this if you adore Science Fiction. Also, if you are drinking, that is not you, it's the stupid movie. No need to call a doctor. A Mediocre Movie With A Dreadful Last Half Hour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favourite Sci-Fi films ever. The story isn't perfect, but the soundtrack, the acting, the mood, the "heroism" makes it one of the few movies I come back to for reflection. The premise, that none makes it, without any possibility of anyone ever knowing why is profound. Still, mission success. The little details. I often go back to IMDb to check if the same director is making another Sci-Fi project. Watching it again now, for like, the 8th time after watching Erik Wernquists "Wanderers". Just simply brings hope into my heart, that we are capable of amazing things, rationally, if we just put our hearts and souls into it. A beautiful piece, I could take the whole movie apart by complaining about it all, but I do not see any point. I love it for all it flaws. And everyone involved in this project should be extremely proud. Edit: The film ends with probably the most appropriate end credit ever. - if you pass the first part. With I am Kloot playing "Avenue of Hope". There is no way of making it through that last part without losing a 4th of your bodyweight in tears while trying to sing the lyrics.</fullReview>

It has some holes in the screenplay, and yes, the last act's development could've been better (although I've heard so many complaints that it was rather surprising in that it wasn't that bad). The directing is really brilliant though, Boyle once again giving it his all and really highlighting some scenes' magic and making them soar. That music score is also such a wonderful piece of work, so lovely and in tune with the film's on-screen action and tone. Cillian Murphy is also pretty good as is the cast.

		<shortDescription>Well-told story, but for one aspect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the movie as a whole, even if the whole dying Sun is an impossible phenomenon and sending a bomb into the Sun and coming back from it is an even bigger impossibility. But, in movies such as this, the set-up serves to tell a story of the decisions various people would make under difficult circumstances, and how the loneliness and confinement of deep space affects psyches in different ways. In that, it succeeds absolutely.However the biggest flaw for me is how Pinbacker is always shown as a blur once he enters Icarus II. That part just kills the movie for me because it rings false and forced. Its like the director thought it up as a means of not making it look like a slasher movie, instead of embracing the fact that extreme insanity, especially religion-based one that Pinbacker suffered from would indeed make someone go on a killing spree, and his obsession with viewing the Sun in all its glory would have lead to his skin being the way it is. There was no need to blur him. That made it look cheap. Instead a full-on visual would have been more successful.Other minor gripe is the event that lead things to go astray, which is the solar panels failing because of misalignment. During repair, the crew indoors repeatedly asks the mainframe, aka Icarus, to adjust/align the paneling automatically, and that leads to one asking the question, "why did Icarus not do the same automatically during course change?" Finally, it was fun to see Captain America and The Scarecrow duke it out on a couple of occasions. :P</fullReview>

Lots of time is spent developing character and pondering life-or-death decisions as the 8-member crew continues on its journey to revitalize our sun. There's also a twist two-third's of the way through which, while not completely unexpected, does move things closer and faster towards the inevitable conclusion and add even more tension than there was before. The movie really shines when it explores the relationships between its characters and the struggle that arises from being confined in the same place with the same people for a long time. Even though I wasn't completely on-board with the movie the entire time, it did have an incredible last act, spectacular visual effects and an amazing, ethereal score.

		<fullReview>This is a film I have watched over and over again and will no doubt rewatch a dozen more times. At the time of release, the concept of the film was pretty unique and the fact that the main character is a nerdy physicist instead of a muscle-y hero immediately made me love this movie a little bit more. Then of course there's the eerie soundtrack by John Murphy and the breathtaking cinematography by Danny Boyle. Add to that some solid acting by the oh-so-arresting blue-eyed Cillian Murphy and you have the recipe for a haunting sci-fi drama. This is not a Michael Bay, explosions-galore type of movie although there is plenty of action. This is a more introspective sci-fi film that presents existential questions in a way I've never seen before or since. It's a truly unique take on the survivalist film culminating in one of the most disturbing and beautiful climaxes.If you enjoy more thought-provoking sci-fi that's more about the characters than the CGI, then I strongly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought "Gravity" was very fresh in theme because it showed how Earth is "our place" by portraying the universe as total evil.Did I like it? No, because there was no dream there. For me, astronauts are people who can die for their dream. Watching "Gravity" makes you feel you never want to go up there. But astronauts still go up there... why? I always thought that was the core question of astronauts character.Which leads to this film, Sunshine 2057.Danny Boyle knows how to show sanity and insanity of the men. He did it so well in 28 days later by using zombies, and this time by using astronauts.If they can die for their dream, they are not only brave, but insane.The scene where Kaneda waiting for certain death by the burst of flare showed that perfectly. "What can you see?" Searle asks Kaneda same question again and again. I mean, Kaneda is going to die, but his crew wants to know what is Sun like with his own eyes instead of whether his captain is OK or not. That's not sane... but agreeable.Some people take points off for later part of the film where a zombish psycho attacks the crew members, but I thought that part was necessary too. As he went too far on his dream, and he became unhuman.And still, the ending tells you that dream is beautiful. Capa burned alive by his dream, but his smile tells it worth dying to see.I think its the best space thriller film so far.</fullReview>

For 2007 and a lower budget, the effects are realistic and not cheesy. The sun was so beautiful it made me want to sit outside and stare directly into the sun (I didn't do that, obviously). Plot wise, it was rushed and lacked depth. At times, scenarios confused me and seemed to jump from one scene to another with no explanation as to how they ended up there. There were a lot of artistic scenes such as blurriness, stoppage, and flashing images that started in the middle of the movie. At the beginning, it had promise to be a good sci-fi movie, but towards the middle, Danny Boyle seemed torn between having a sci-fi drama or an artsy thriller/slasher movie. Regardless, a movie to check out anyway just for the music and graphics.</fullReview>

The direction was really good. You feel for the characters and the characters themselves feel real.Basically the story is about these 8 astronauts going to the dying sun in a spaceship named Icarus 2, in order to put a bomb into it in the hope of making it come alive again. This is the 2nd similar mission done by humankind. They had already send a spaceship named Icarus 1 to bomb the sun. But they were unsuccessfulThe bad thing is the plot holes are giant as well as innumerable.- They find Icarus 1 still near the sun. So they decide to go in there. 4 of them go inside Icarus 1 but none of them even thinks of taking a spacesuit with them. GREAT.- Suddenly they find their airlock broken. So they decide to travel to their spaceship WITHOUT a suit. How ridiculous. Only one of them have a spacesuit. Aren't they in like space? How can you even think of going in space without a suit?- They find all the crew in Icarus 1 dead. They find a creepy video of the captain talking some crap about God and religion and how humans are so small before god. And, suddenly they find this undead captain of Icarus 1 in their own spaceship. How the hell did he get in Icarus 1?-Now the movie becomes a big budget b-grade horror one in which the still undead captain goes on a killing spree. Seriously, what happened to all those guys in Icarus 1? Did they just go mad?If you look past the beautiful visuals and mesmerizing background score, there's nothing good in Sunshine</fullReview>

The men being one, weak player and 'god', the ambient the human nature and its limits being - admittedly - a greater, smarter player. The one week player needs to sacrifices pieces in order to win the game - and so does the Icarus II crew, whose lives were irrelevant upon the greatness of the mission. Looks dehumanized and overly rational? Not sure. If you can sacrifice yourself to a greater good, this does make you more human than the religious fanatic who wants to end the world because of its dubious and insane beliefs(an reference to Christian religion in the past). That is Boyle's finest film alongside Transpotting,hopefully you can enjoy this flawed but beautiful and meaningful science fiction masterpiece.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually impressive, conceptually brilliant, but the film had a couple of problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH*****Sunshine follows a team of 8 people (a crew of astronauts and scientists) who are tasked with a mission of saving the dying sun in order to ensure the survival of the human race. Their task is made all the more difficult due to the fact that the previous crew on board Icarus 1 had already failed in this mission 7 years ago. Can the team on board Icarus 2 be more successful? I watched this film on film 4 this evening and Danny Boyle gave a prologue before the film started. I don't usually watch these prologues, but I find Danny Boyle to be an interesting director so I decided to watch it. In his prologue he referenced the film Alien and that was the thing that stuck in my mind when watching this film; for the first 30 minutes, this film is very similar to Alien in terms of its approach; the characters, the atmosphere, the camera panning round the ship. I feel that in some ways that Boyle was paying a bit of homage to Alien.One thing that has to be acknowledged in this film is the impressive visuals; the CGI and special effects were a joy to the eyes, but these elements can only be carried so far and for films of this nature to work they need to have a good story which brings me neatly onto my next point; THE CONCEPT; I thought that the idea of a group of astronauts and scientists going on a voyage to save the sun to be a fascinating concept. If we look at this in more depth, the Sun (in the real world) is dying so in millions possibly billions of years to come this may become a reality (although obviously not in our life time). Boyle and his writers have created a concept that isn't relevant now, but could be in a long time to come.The film for the most part was tense and engaging and kept me interested throughout. If I was to commend 1 actor in particular it would be Hiroyuki Sanada as Captain Kaneda (the only other role I have seen him in before this film was as Jackie Chan's evil brother Kenji in Rush Hour 3 - which again he was excellent in). He is a very talented actor who I will definitely look out for in the future). Cillian Murphy was also fairly good in the lead role of Robert Capa). For me ,there were only a couple of things that spoilt this film for me; OK, when the team discover Icarus 1 they find that the ship is pretty much trashed, yet the oxygen room is undamaged and fully functional, yet on Icarus 2 fire destroyed the oxygen room. Surely if fire would destroy an Oxygen room on a ship then crashing into another planet would at least damage the Oxygen Room on a ship which was constructed in the same way. Worse still, a few crew members manage to get across 20 metres from the pod on Icarus 1 to the pod of Icarus 2 in temperatures of -293 degrees Celsius with all but 1 member of the crew just wrapping themselves in foil. I just don't believe that you could survive in that sort of temperature for any amount of time (no matter how well wrapped up you are). I also couldn't understand how they managed to drift 20 metres from 1 pod to another without any problems (there's no gravity in space so how did they maintain a horizontal trajectory?) The plot twist involving the lone survivor on Icarus 1 was also quite lame as well as being completely illogical, but despite these problems, I still can't deny that this was a hugely engrossing and impressive film which was conceptually brilliant and visually impressive. Had it not been for the many holes in the second half of the film, this may have garnered a score of 9 from me as I was really impressed with the film. However, there were too many problems in the second half, but Sunshine still gets an impressive 8 out of 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall the movie gets 3 stars because it's visually well done and it plays with some interesting ideas in terms of philosophical questions and story telling. For instance the crew going on this missions are average Joe and janes and the movie uses the cliché of someone from the crew turning evil or going mad as a red herring to increase suspension. And it works quite well throughout 2/3 of the movie, but the last 1/3 is so bad that it literally obliterates everything it build up to with plot-holes and a change in genres from sci-fi to B- horror-flick. Usually I'm very forgiving about cheap plot-devices and some of the holes they might create but towards the end the holes became so painfully obvious that it almost hit the "so-bad-that-it's- funny" mark but not quite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great buildup, bizarre climax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knowing going in that this is a sci-fi movie, I'm prepared to suspend my disbelief. I know there are going to be holes, etc. Now right up to the climax/plot twist, I'm thoroughly entertained. The characters are done well, even for the relatively obscure cast. They present some interesting situations and problems along the way. The score is awesome. The interesting way of using light to convey menace and fear is different.So what happened? Well, they pick up the Icarus I and decide to go check it out after some debate. Why? 2 payloads are better than one. Okay. You know this is an obvious plot device, but what is it leading up to? That the commander of the first Icarus mission is still alive, disfigured, and driven insane with the notion that we should not be playing God and humanity should be allowed to die out. Huh. So at this point, the movie has gone from an interesting sci-fi adventure to a half-assed slasher movie that you had no interest in seeing.They could have gone in so many other directions for a climax, but they chose this? In my opinion, an above average sci-fi movie is marred by this completely weird and somewhat comical turn of events. I thought this might be a really good sci-fi drama that would be the reboot the genre needs and show the others how it's done. If not for the funky climax, that might have been so. I try to ignore that but I can't. So I can only call this an average movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie but wastes it potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This creates a scary premise: The sun is dying and a crew of astronauts have to go and reignite it. The first 2 thirds of the film are awesome, with amazing visuals that don't at all resemble the movie's $40 million budget and a never ending sense of claustrophobia. For the first half, the film never stops, and with the endless deaths, suspense pieces and fear the film becomes genuinely heart in mouth, and turns the provider of life into the big enemy. It's also got a great soundtrack, and many of the early set pieces are far more scary than anything from most modern horror films. The film doesn't have any big themes or emotional character backstories, but who cares? Those would have clogged up the film. The film has a good colour scheme, with the dark, disturbing spaceship interiors contrasting with the sun, and Danny Boyle has created a work of sunny, suspenseful art with just $40 million, a bunch of relatively unknown actors, a studio set and some great studio lighting. Then, in the last half hour, he throws it in the bin.The film is very good if a little unmemorable before that, but by adding Mark Strong as a disfigured space captain hunting and killing the ships crew the film goes from 2001 A Space Odyssey to Jason X very fast. The slasher silliness of the last half hour isn't scary at all, and feels incredibly half hearted. Watching the tension evaporate slowly as the last act carries on its descent into mediocrity is incredibly frustrating, and seems like it was just an excuse either to appeal to teenagers or to let Danny Boyle pay homage to Alien. It's still an alright movie with great filmmaking, but if it wasn't for the awful final twist this would be regarded as one of the better science fiction movies of the 21st century.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive technology and ideas ruined by a terrible development and ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this one a 7 out of 10 because it started really well with interesting dialogues, science, great technology and good visuals. Character development is nicely done, because you see ordinary people and not heroes like in many sci-fi movies. As said in other reviews before, what ruins this movie is a story development to one more survival horror in space that we've seen so many times in other Hollywood blockbusters. What was in Danny Boyle's mind for making this kind of change in such a good science fiction movie?! The last 20/30 minutes remind me the bad Event Horizon after a From Dusk Till Dawn kind of twist. It's really bad that the director wasn't able to make a creative solution for producing one more classic in science fiction, or maybe it was simply a choice for getting easier for more modern audiences. He could go through a Apollo 13 way with the advantage of using futuristic science for the overcoming of technical failures in space to achieve an objective, or he could go through a 2001 kind of art movie because a vital area of our solar system was being reached, the one where light that fuel all living things is provided. Instead the common Man playing God with a moral punishment by nobody knows who(!?) is presented, and that lack of creativity breaks down immediately the interest in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>suspense in space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose that man has Always reached for the stars and wondered what is out there.Besides figuring out how to travel long distances in space I guess Another great challenge is how people adjust (or not) to being totally isolated in space, cramped together with a small crew (i.e. not meeting Another soul for months and months, not being able to disconnect from your surroundings when needed and above all being light years away from any rescue if something goes South).Plot: a small crew is on their way to our fading star (the sun) to kick start it with Atomic bombs to save Earth. A previous mission failed, no one knew what happened...until now...Sunshine could have turned out to be slasher or monster Movie set in space, luckily the Movie builds instead on suspense, psychological pressure and somewhat realistic incidents. Although the main plot is highly unlikely the creators and the actors manage to deliver a believable Movie.The interiors of the space Crafts are well made, the acting is good, you care about the characters, it is suspenseful and the different reactions to what is happening as well as the characters of the Movie having different personalities makes the Movie interesting and exciting.This is not a horror Movie, so if you expect nasty aliens killing off the crew...do not Watch this Movie. If you liked Event Horizon and Cargo you will enjoy this one, if you liked Alien/Aliens and/or Soliaris...well...this one will be a major disappointment for you.I give it 8 out of 10 because of its high production values and its suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine takes place fifty years from now; the sun is dying, and mankind is dying with it. Our last hope: a spaceship and a crew of eight men and women. They carry a device which will breathe new life into the star. But deep into their voyage, out of radio contact with Earth, their mission is starting to unravel. There is an accident, a fatal mistake, and a distress beacon from a spaceship that disappeared seven years earlier. Soon the crew is fighting not only for their lives, but their sanity.Dany Boyle,the director, has mention 2001, A Space Odissey and Solaris as two of the inspirations behind Sunshine and it shows. The film can only be described as an epic sci-fi extravaganza. Everything about it screams epic, the sets, the special effects, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, everything. It's one of those films that aims at being something more then just a film. I'm not saying it manages to do so, but it certainly tries hard. And the film is never pretentious in any way. I think Boyle was trying to create something beautiful but despite his efforts the film felt somewhat short. Let me be clear about this, Sunshine is a great piece of work, just not the masterpiece it seems intended to be.Some of the criticism has been related to the fact that Sunshine turns into something similar to a slasher film in its final third. At least for a little bit. And I have to agree with this criticism. It seemed a little out of place with the overall theme of the film. Apart from that, there's not much you can criticize. Clearly a lot of thought was put into this film and the direction is impeccable. The cinematography is awe-inspiring and the soundtrack extremely fitting. The acting was superb as well, real solid work with Cilian Murphy standing out.Some have interpreted Sunshine as an atheistic film while others have labeled it a spiritual odyssey. There's certainly no denying that the film is about the origin of the universe despite it being masqueraded in a very entertaining and well-put together sci-fi plot. As an interesting side note, I read that Boyle is religious and he interpreted the story as a triumph of faith over science while Alex Garland, the main writer is an atheist and saw the film as a triumph of science over faith. I, myself I'm an atheist but I think the film can be interpreted both ways and because of that will probably please a lot of people. All in all, it's not the masterpiece it could have been, but I highly recommend Sunshine. Certainly a must-see for sci-fi fans.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent science fiction film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the year 2057 and our Sun is dying. Sunshine follows the mission of the spaceship Icarus II, whose goal is to reignite our dying Sun by detonating a large bomb within the Sun's core.Sunshine is pretty much as close to a "pure" science fiction film as you can get. I say "pure" sci-fi in that the emphasis is more on science than fantasy with an attempt at a futuristic story that contains some degree of scientific validity. One of the principal themes (I thought) was the ascension of the power of science to a similar status level as that of nature.Overall, I found the story to be engaging, the characters interesting, and the film's themes thought-provoking. Sunshine is also very beautiful at times, featuring a fantastic musical score and outstanding visuals.Another theme of Sunshine is that of the Sun representing the power of nature, a sort of natural God if you will. Some of the imagery involving the Sun was stunning. There's a particularly beautiful scene that involves the Sun and Mercury. You'll know it when you see it.However, Sunshine isn't perfect. I won't spoil it, but the film takes a bit of a turn close to the end and I found a few of the later scenes to be somewhat jarring in contrast to the rest of the movie. I can understand where the director was coming from, but I thought these later scenes could have been executed a little better..Regardless, still a great film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangely compelling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise for the film is almost as idiotic as The Core, and it was a bad idea to introduce the superhuman monster Mr Pinbacker and the slasher ending, and yet, I must say the film is strangely compelling, and the first 3/4 of it are actually quite good. I am not sure why but I think it is because the characters, even without any back-stories (or perhaps precisely because of that), are real people, a rarity in sci-fi films. All the actors do excellent work and in spite of the flaws of the individual characters, I had much more empathy for all eight leads than 90% of film characters I meet. There is an unusual absence of clichés (until the end) and, paradoxically given the absurdity of the overall plot, it all feels very real. Chris Evans and Cillian Murphy are excellent in this film, as are the supporting actors. I ended up being fascinated by them all. The cockfight between Capa and Mace was really well done, and I felt so sorry for Trey, Harvey and Corazon as each of them broke down. And even if the premise is silly, the whole mission became strangely authentic, the claustrophobia acute, the characters' fascination with the sun hauntingly real. i ended up watching it again, just after having watched it for the first time (and to write this review for no good reason).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunshine - My first 'review'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me 4 years to convince myself to watch Sunshine, the Danny Boyle sci-fi flick. I think mostly because my film taste has matured somewhat, but also because this film looked promising, and I often regret getting over-excited for a film before seeing it.So after watching the entire film without an blink, I can safely say that Sunshine will be on my mind for weeks to come. This film, about a crew of astronauts and scientists and their ever fraying mindset, as they become increasingly isolated and desperate as they try and re-ignite the sun - has been superbly made. The film hits home in a lot of departments: Cinematography, Score, SFX, Acting and Character Development. There could have been some improvements on the editing side, and the overall plot was a little loose.** Spoilers ** The subplot with the Icarus I is understandable, but the character of 'Pinbacker' was almost useless, with no thought behind the character. If Danny Boyle had left this character to the side, and left the film as purely food for thought and moral decay... it could have been a masterpiece.**Overall, 7/10. Very impressive, but some factors included halted this from entering my top 10 films.P.S. Thanks for reading if you made it until the end :P I'd appreciate any constructive criticism on how to get the gist of writing a better review!</fullReview>

Small events were given time and larger events such as the difficulty of docking with another ship almost just happened. During some parts of the movie it wasn't clear exactly what was happening and the science behind the project wasn't fleshed out at all.You might have to watch twice with subtitles on to really understand it.</fullReview>

The actors played well and were well cast. There are plenty of refences to Dark Star and 2001: A Space Odyssey, although it lacks the detail that made 2001: A Space Odyssey so fascinating.The first half of the movie is just great, somehow timeless and philosophical and filled with stunning visuals. But later, at around the point where the crew begin discussing the idea to rendezvous with the other spaceship, and acting on it, the story degenerates, and hits rock bottom when a rather silly horror element is introduced: the appearance of what essentially is a monster bent on murder and sabotage.The pace quickens too much in the second half, and seems to leap from one scene to the next, skipping too much in between. I get the impression that this was originally 3 hour movie and much was edited out of the second half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sun is being destroyed from inside out by a type of highly stable form of matter that renders nuclear fusion impossible, by turning common matter on its own kind. The only hope is to send a team of astronauts to detonate a massive, highly energetic bomb, able to destroy this strange matter and restore Sun's natural state.Judging by the trailer, you think the film might be an experience. It is. The movie is a spectacle, with great visuals and special effects! Sadly, that's the only thing that drives this movie to be different from other similar movies.Sure, killing crew members one by one is good the first time you see it (Alien), it'still good if you've seen it the second time (The Core), and it might be okay if you've seen it the third time (Armageddon), but for a fourth time, it might get too repetitive. This film doesn't want to be any different.We've seen it so many times, already, ladies and gentlemen. There are always situations where one crew member has to die. There's always a baddie and so on. I liked this movie not because of that, but because of the performances and some twists that you wouldn't expect.The score, cinematography, visuals, and special effects are great in this movie. The plot, otherwise, isn't any different from most films. Am I recommending this movie for you?

Ignoring yet another slap in the face to physics (red giants etc) by the clowns with the pens (Garland is an awful writer so I'm not surprised I'm writing this, check out his track-history) this just gets worse when you are further led to believe that there is a saboteur on board but (here's the twist) this saboteur turns out to have been adrift on the sabotaged Icarus 1 for the last 7 years, is burnt to a crisp because he likes to look directly in the sun for fun, has not left a single sign of activity over said 7 years on a dust encrusted ship, has superhuman strength and a bad attitude and of course is doing God's work. I am staggered by the number of positive reviews this detritus has received.Boyle you made 2 good films in Shallow Grave and Trainspotting. Life less ordinary and 28 days later were....mediocre.

Comparing Sunshine with Trainspotting wouldn't make much sense I guess, but it shows on the other hand the impressive reach of Boyle's talent, especially when you see what an incredible sf-film Sunshine is. The whole feeling of the movie is realistic (except for that survivor of Icarus I and that we ultimately will have to face the terror of black holes) and it's amazing in it's details: the distress-beacon of Icarus I gave me a shiver down the spine, for example (compare it with the beacon of the head in Mission to Mars!). And what about those amazing mushroom- lights?!So also a huge compliment to the sound- department of the film - great job guys!Only the flashes of the Icarus I-crew's faces after the Icarus II-crew entered the Icarus I were not really working for me - maybe the effect 'belongs' too much to the horror-genre. And also the dust-thing in the Icarus I isn't the most convincing part of the movie. But then the model of the Icarus spacecrafts is again really great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sun is beginning to expire after how many millions of years of hard work, and this film poses the question without forcing you to decide: Do we humans have the right or even the ability to interfere with "God's" infinite plans? A mission was launched seven years prior to the time of this story, which takes place in 2057. That first mission, in 2050, was the Icarus I, which failed and vanished without a trace. Now Icarus II, commanded by Captain Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada), is going to make the same attempt to deliver a bomb that will hopefully jump-start the sun's power. All of earth's resources have been exhausted in the making of Icarus II's bomb, so there won't be an Icarus III if II fails.That is why when Icarus I is suddenly discovered lurking near Mercury, its distress signal heard by Comms officer Harvey (Troy Garity), such a difficult and fateful decision was made by Kaneda with the help of the psychologist Dr. Searle (Cliff Curtis) and the physicist Capa (Cillian Murphy), the decision to divert from their original flightplan to possibly recover Icarus I's bomb. What if II's bomb fails? Isn't it better to have two bombs than one? This decision sets of a disastrous chain of events, beginning with the navigator Trey (Benedict Wong) accidentally forgetting to re-set the heat shield for the new angle of approach to the sun. There is some structural damage to Icarus II, but the ultimate cost of this simple error proves very high. From here on, the crew of Icarus II faces hardships one after another as they struggle to survive and to complete their task.Trey ends up hating himself over his one mistake. Co-pilot Mace (Chris Evans) is furious with Capa for his role in Kaneda's decision to divert from the original objective. Capa himself feels guilty but as he said earlier, "A decision like this is no different than tossing a coin...heads or tails?" And botanist Corazon (Michelle Yeoh), having lost the wonderful oxygen garden she took special pride in, becomes icy-cold when weighing the survival of the crew against the availability of breathable air on the ship. The ship's pilot, Cassie (Rose Byrne) is stunned when confronted with Corazon's ethics, and Harvey begins to fragment emotionally when he realizes his role in the mission is less of a priority than those of other crew members.Unknown to the crew, an even greater threat lurks in their presence, an enemy that is hell-bent on thwarting their mission.Like many good action/sci-fi movies of past and present (APOLLO 13 and ALIEN come to mind), the crew of the Icarus II are well developed as complex human characters, making this story much more than a colorful CGI treat. I usually feel only half-full after watching most movies that have loads of CGI, but in a space movie, how else can you depict space? Anyway, my point is, this ain't ATTACK OF THE CLONES, okay? The only gripe I have about this film is that aside from a couple of the characters who are of Asian descent, everyone seems to have an American accent. I think it would have been much more fun to have let the actors from Australia, New Zealand and Ireland retain their native accents. I also really enjoyed the deleted scenes. The montage of chess playing, gathering carrots, cooking, etc. was nice and could have been left in, but even better is the scene where Cassie and Capa discuss Trey and the wisdom of Kaneda's/Capa's decision.For a while, I missed the wicked humour that is the earmark of Boyle's earlier and later films, but it just doesn't belong here. In all, a very satisfying and entertaining sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burns itself out?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having come from not seeing Trainspotting or 28 Days Later (to my friends' derision) I decided to buy this and watch it to see what Boyle and Garland had to offer.I came away from the movie just feeling absolutely knackered as I tried to figure out what the heck was meant to have happened and from when it changed from an interesting, psychological thriller with decent graphics to essentially a hackfest with blurred camera shots and a zero-G plot?! I really enjoyed the set up and felt that the characterisation was very good (Chris Evans consistently surprised me) and I looked forward to the rest of the movie until Icarus II and the plot went off course...It felt to me like it couldn't decide what it wanted to do and whilst the Captain was definitely a haunting character, it felt misused. The climax also was peculiar and disappointing. I don't know who would have decided to do that shift but if it was a decision of everyone involved then I feel it demerits the whole thing.There were some nice touches (the obsession with the sunlight and the faces of Icarus I) and the tension and atmosphere were deftly handled. I will watch it again and hopefully I will see the light...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure that many people will mark this review as unhelpful, since it says nothing about the technical aspects of the film in any depth. It will, however, say quite a bit about its impact.The film stays solely within the bounds of the Icarus II for the entire film, save the end. By the time it draws to a close, you've seen maybe one minute of action on Earth. It seems as though the last of humanity dies with the crew. This film reminds you of how truly fragile the human race really is, and how little we mean to anything outside our atmosphere. As for how this will effect you, I can't say, but when I finished watching "Sunshine", I called my girlfriend to tell her I loved her, just in case.A truly powerful film. Were it not for the fact that future films could fare better somehow, I would rate this a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to repeat what's already been said, but I came here with a clear format in mind for my comment, and found that it had been posted countless times already.As it has all already been said, let me add my support for the general opinion in as few words as possible:The first third: Evocative, atmospheric, with clichés that aid familiarity with the 'feel' of the movie rather than ruin it. A good watch that drags you into the second third.The second third: Oh dear. The clichés are getting staid now. The characters start behaving like plot devices rather than intelligent humans. It's all starting to fall apart, the mission AND the story.The third third (or turd, if you like): Did they get Stephen King to vandalise this part of the movie?? It's not of the calibre or style of the first act - not by a hundred solar units! Where did it all go wrong?With a strong start but a flagging and nonsensical finale, this movie promised to be something better than it ended up being. Vaseline and over-exposed camera effects don't so much hide as amplify the ridiculous elements that trash the end of this movie.I wish I'd watched the first half and missed the second - I would have been happier never knowing. What a waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh Sunshine, you poor, poor, beautiful, confused piece of celluloid.Look at you. A jaw droppingly pretty, sublime, well conceived, well casted &amp; acted, semi intelligent, gripping Sci Fi - and then....catastrophe strikes. After just over an hour, all semblance of the thoroughly engaging plot suddenly dribbles away quicker than a musty fart through a leaky airlock.I saw 'Sunshine' in the cinema when it first came out and have recently bought the DVD, as I always loved the hypnotic quality of the film. Whilst it remains visually and aurally stunning throughout (thanks to director Danny Boyle's cinematography &amp; Underworld &amp; John Murphy's fantastic score), the derivative and predictable horror ending seems to be more fitted to a teen slasher movie. Enigmatic characters that were developing nicely are wasted (literally and figuratively) in the most embarrassingly lame ways, or just forgotten about entirely, as the slow burn intensity and philosophical thriller elements are cast aside for seemingly tacked on, standard Hollywood chasey chasey scary man scenes, complete with B-movie dialogue. Arrrrgh, Alex Garland (the writer), for the love of god, what happened? Was it Hollywood pressure that made you slap on this ending? Not enough action in the film? Script deadline to meet? Just plain old ran out of ideas? So...what was shaping up to be a crackingly good, intriguing psychological Sci Fi thriller (finally!), just falls into the same tedious category as all the other Sci Fi white elephant stinker let downs. And there are really, really, really TOO many of these by now. I can't write 'Sunshine' off completely though, it's the best of the let downs so far and a sensory treat to behold. Danny Boyle really is very good at what he does. Just wake me up when someone adapts an Iain M. Banks novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ironically, This Film Has No "Flame"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the moment Danny Boyle decided to turn the camera on, he thought it would be nice to plough in excess every single aspect of the movie. He raised the volume to the maximum, used too much unnecessary brightness, contrasted with obvious darkness with fairly dull establishing shots and poured a lame group of astronauts that are not deepened individually nor socially. They are on outer space, about to save the world. And they seem like they are on a road trip to San Diego.This movie is not a study of anything, it's mostly noise, emptiness around the void on space and metaphysical dialogs weaven with sleeper subplots. Fire, Subliminal Images to shock the audience and leave them paralyzed of how Boyle decided to mistreat them.Sure, it's unconventional. And if by "unconventional" you mean "far from average yet bad" I'm not drinking Boyle's Milkshake anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alien meets 2001: a Space Odessy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main purpose of a movie is, by my opinion, primarily to entertain. To keep your mind of things, for at least some hours. There are serious movies, with actual social themes, there a comedy movies, with naked women and stupid guys... 'Sunshine' is, however, not in that category.Very much like 'Batman begins' make you (or at least some people) feel, that this is really the beginning, 'Sunshine' makes you feel, that you are back to something, that went missing a long time ago (in a galaxy far far away).It is not a space opera, action packed and romantic movie. But a very special Sci-fi thriller. What I liked the best was, that you are put right in there. No beginning or long intro, explaining the characters, their relations and so on. It's very much like the first 'Star Wars'.I felt, as I was walking to the bus with my girlfriend, that this was a very special movie. Very much character driven, because the special effect where so amazing from the very first minute, that you totally forget everything about them. It's very much like 'Star Wars' physics. You don't think about the technology trying to explain how a lightsabre works. You just accept it and get carried away.If you liked "2001: A Space Odessy" for the music, grand scale and interesting photography, if you liked 'Solaris' for the 'spookiness' (I don't even now if that's an actual word) and you liked "Aliens" for the claustrophobic atmosphere, you will love "Sunshine". I you don't like character driven movies, you will tend much more to focus on the facts of how things work. Don't. Just sit down, take a deep breath, and prepare yourself.I'll buy this one, as soon I can effort a High Definition player, because the imagery i all worth it. And last but not least: It's a great story, told in a great way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember going to the Cinema a couple of years ago and upon finding the movie that I wanted to see booked solid I picked at random &amp; bought my popcorn with a certain level of trepidation...that movie turned out to be Pitch Black. I happened to see Sunshine in a very similar way and found it staggeringly captivating in places. However i have to agree that the third act appeared to be a little fragmented, hurried and a little out of sync with the rest of the movie. I preferred the edge of seat absolutes to the very open ended theoretical ramblings toward the end. That said the movie contains one particular sequence where music, visual &amp; the emotional tie in perfect harmony to deliver one massive impact on the senses in the form of a most terrifying scale... that one sequence makes it all worthwhile. This is a Cult Classic, the world just does not know that yet!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scary science fiction, one of the finest of 2007!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine was a wonderful science-fiction from Danny Boyle,the director of the best horror film of this decade,28 Days Later. Reteaming again with actor Cillian Murphy, Director Danny Boyle tells this interesting story with his usual glare and the peculiar sense of visual, reinforced by the cast's strong supporting and the excellent nerve-wracking soundtrack that creates tension when its required. The story of Sunshine revolves around some years into the future. The sun dying, a second team of astronauts is sent to discover what happened to the first team, who mysteriously disappeared, and reignite the sun. Strange things happen along the way, when the second crew find the first ship orbiting the sun and then decides to intervene, bringing disastrous consequences for the mission. The is not a single weak link regarding the movie's cast. Cillian Murphy plays the main character, almost as the character he played on 28 Days Later: an every-day nice guy to the boot who saves the day. Supporting cast counts with equally talented actors. Rose Byrne from 28 Weeks Later plays Cillian's love interest. A wonderful Japanese actor who captured my attention back in 2003 thanks to his performance on "Ringu" here plays the father-figure for the team, and he steals the movie with every scene he's got. He is undoubtedly the outstanding performance from Sunshine. Sunshine counts with extremely, exquisitely well done space visuals. It reminds the classic shocker Alien, here and there (inside of the ships, and so on). Although not a horror movie, it is a scary roller-coaster ride, because when you get to understand the magnitude of these guys' mission, you know that millions of things can go wrong, leaving you "How the hell will they solve this now?!". I strongly recommend Sunshine, one of the finest science fiction of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me first say that I liked Sunshine. But towards the end, It got a little annoying, not to mention confusing. But I really was not a fan of where the second half of the film goes. Don't want to put in any spoilers, so I'll just say that... the situation changes. I liked how it was shot in the part although some of the cuts in the last half were a bit too much. Constant going and stopping was a bit much. The characters were great though. Very Danny Boyle. The sci-fi aspect was amazing, It has a very Event Horizon or Sphere feeling. It also made me feel at times very claustrophobic. Lots of movement in an enclosed space ship. anyway Still, it was a good movie and well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saving the Earth from cataclysmic disaster is a way in which stories can uplift viewers with its characters selflessly putting their lives on the line for the better good. But when a film ventures fifty years into the future into a world which is somewhat incomprehensible, only to tell the same tale, its amazing that it can also possess a good level of maturity creating characters that are believable in their actions.As humankind's last hope of survival, a crew of eight are launched into space on a mission to re-ignite the sun, which is undergoing a process of dying, with a massive explosive charge. On board the Icarus II, the crew are in fact the Earths second chance at surviving the freezing cold, after a previous crew had failed. However, a simple plan turns bad when a distress signal is found from the missing Icarus I and it is decided to meet up with the spacecraft. A miscalculation ensues and the Icarus II is forced to sustain critical damage to its oxygen supply, resulting in fatal decisions being made from each individual crew member.Sunshine sports a story which is very much character driven, and this is partially due to the limited selection of environments, which itself helps users become identifiable with the unique technology possible in the future. With this accomplished, the story is able to allow for solid pacing with gripping suspense being interchanged, with cinematic subtlety, into horror. The questions of human survival are tastefully executed allowing for a film that can easily work on various levels if one chooses. If anything, the story suffers when we are finally given a glimpse of earth and its dire condition. While the scenery is realistic in context, all mystery surrounding the earth that the crews of Icarus I and II were trying to save, is lost.The entire cast, while not award winning in their acting, prove utterly convincing. Capa (Cillian Murphy) and Mace (Chris Evans) are easily the most dominate, who while constantly at each others throats, share similar traits in regards to the best possible action in achieving their mission. The other actors help create a distinct cause of contrast in respect to their characters personalities, with a prime example being between Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada), who will give up his life in order to repair the shields of the ship, and second-in-command Harvey (Troy Garity), who fears his own death, and is willing to compromise the mission to save his life. An important aspect of the characters portrayed, is the element of paranoia, which brings about important issues of human survival, and as well helping the contrast of the various crew. Aiding the present paranoia, is a great selection of music which is constantly eerie, and at times yields stints of grandeur. A problem with the use of sound comes in the form of the the female on-board voice of Icarus 2. There is a hint of seductiveness in the voice which comes across as out of place.This is not the only problem however. While the film is based upon the sun, the director, Danny Boyle, perhaps places too much emphasis on the sun with some awesome special effects, which are reminiscent of those found in The Fountain. The problem is not that there is too much of it, for it realistically helps exude an important aspect of the film, but it at times seems to place less focus on the characters themselves. Sadly, the special effects of the suns rays, bring about another difficulty: there are a minute selection of scenes which make use of a strange screen distortion, which is highly unrealistic, but seems to be put in place due to the high number of special effects used for the sun, which in themselves, makes scenes less viewable to the viewer. These screen transitions are used for the purpose of mystery, but come across as an amateur attempt at best.The film does an excellent job of not resorting to sex or nudity, or milder representations thereof, to help titillate viewers. Instead a more mature and realistic approach is taken, and this brings about a variety of contextual language which is more placed in groups rather than sporadically throughout. Sunshine is also not without violence, which is haunting instead of commercialised. The many deaths, while not especially gut wrenching, do prove to fit their respective situations, with one scene showing the aftermath of a successful suicide attempt.Sunshine illuminates itself into the best that cinema has to offer. Every aspect is well conceived in its execution, but it is not without its faults. These however, never distract from what is ultimately an entertaining and thought provoking experience.--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an very good sci-fi suspense thriller, one of the best that I've seen. In particular, the scene where Capa and Kaneda go out to repair the shield had me on the edge of my seat (literally).However, in trying to make the film something more, the director has managed to make it less. What is good in the film arises from the hard sci-fi elements. The horror sub-plot detracts from it.The main plot of the movie has everything that is necessary to give rise to drama and tensions among the crew, to explain the disappearance of the first mission and the problems of the current one: A ship and crew placed in an extreme situation, a supremely hostile environment, and the struggle to survive and succeed in their "last best hope" mission.Re-editing this film, to remove the sub plot, would tighten it up and make of it one of the best science fiction movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leaving the lack of scenes with Michelle Yeoh to one side...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I could give this an eight and a half, i would - its nearly a great film, just with a few flaws.The striking thing about this movie is that although it has a very original premise, so much of it is familiar from so many previous similar sci-fi movies, from 2001 to Dark Star, Free Running to Event Horizon. There is even a pretty good joke in reference to Alien (which is pretty realistic, after all anyone in the future is likely to have seen the Alien movies, which would probably be up to the 20th sequel by then). But while much of it is predictable, its so well made it carried me along, although the director did overstretch himself a few times - especially in those scenes shot on Icarus 1. Also, unusually for a modern movie of this type, if anything its a bit too short, a bit too heavily edited (I get the impression that it was chopped a little in post production) - I would have liked another 10 minutes to give us a feel for the dynamics of the characters. Oh OK, i really just wanted to see more of Michelle Yeoh, the main reason i went to see this movie! But seriously, this is the main flaw of this movie - although the actors do a good job, there just isn't enough attention given to their development, you don't really feel for them (my feelings for Michelle Yeoh don't count, i've had them for years!). I read that the director made the actors live together for a week before shooting - this may have backfired, as there is a lack of humor in their interaction - any bunch of intelligent people who are together in a space ship are bound to develop a graveyard sense of humor about their situation, this lot seemed far too serious too much like... well, too much like a bunch of actors who've spent too long in each others company.But this aside, i found the premise for the movie both intelligent and very well expressed. So many physicists now use God as a metaphor for the deeper areas of science, that it is oddly believable that (spoiler alert), someone would find it impossible to separate what they are doing from the works of God.Just one bit of advice for those thinking of going - don't wait for the DVD, this is definitely a movie for the big screen or not at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Treat yourself to time in the Sunshine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Boyle is a director that refuses to be pigeon-holed. Yes, his first few films (Shallow Grave and Trainspotting) had a certain feel to them, but then he sprung A Life Less Ordinary onto the slightly bemused public, and also The Beach. After that he switched to digital film for the gritty and chilling 28 Days Later, before deciding that he ought to make a family friendly film (of sorts) in the guise of Millions. All differently toned films, with differing styles. So, when he announced he was making a sci-fi about a mission to the sun, who knew what to expect? Would it be an action packed blockbuster, would it be gritty 'Alien-esque' tension, or perhaps Solaris-paced cerebral story? The answer is a little bit of all three.The time is the future, and the Sun in slowly dying. Mankind's last hope for survival is a mission to launch a bomb into the core of our life-giving star and 'jump-start' its heart. Enter the stunning craft Icarus 2, and the on-board team of scientists, pilots, and tech experts. They are truly the planet's last chance, as the previous mission lost contact and vanished. The crew on Icarus 2 are well into their mission, and some tensions and rivalries, along with a few obsessions, have built up. Mace (Chris Evans ? almost unrecognizable at the start of the film) and Capa (the ever excellent Cillian Murphy) have a few disagreements, whilst Searle (Cliff Curtis) 'bathes' in the dangerous rays from the sun. It seems, as the crew prepare to enter the 'dead zone' area where all contact with Earth will be lost, that boredom and frustration is settling in. Then, not long after entering the zone, they pick up a distress signal from Icarus 1. This one event triggers a series of problems for the team that may put their mission, their lives, and the fate of all mankind at risk.Sunshine owes a great deal to films such as 2001, and Event Horizon, amongst others. From pan-shots of the craft moving through space, to the strange events on the Icarus 1, all the moments in the film have some origin in another films elsewhere. However this isn't a bad thing as in Boyle's skilled hands he has built up an impressive sci-fi drama with a cast who (especially in Evan's case) have seemed to step up a gear. The interplay between the inhabitants of Icarus is reminiscent of those of Nostromo in Alien, totally believable and well written. As the events of the film come to pass the relationships are stretched and pulled, and the cast throw themselves into the drama.This is a film to see on the big screen in order to appreciate the amazing visuals on offer. The majesty of the Icarus is a sight to behold. With a soundtrack to compliment the visuals, the end experience is a good one. Sure, you've seen it all before, but just because you had gateau last week doesn't mean you don't want to eat it again, does it? Treat yourself to Sunshine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ** SUNSHINE (2007) Director: Danny Boyle. Stars: Rose Byrne, Cillian Murphy, Chris Evans.My Rating: 8 out of 10.I may seem a little biased towards Sunshine as I love my Science Fiction. And this is top notch sci-fi. Heed a warning, go in with an open mind. I found the story quite interesting.A team of astronauts are sent to re-ignite the dying sun 50 years into the future. The story revolves around the vessel transporting the astronauts towards the Sun, The Icarus II. We soon find out that this is a second mission to try and give the Sun a lifeline, after the first mission, Icarus I, mysteriously disappeared. As they travel closer to their destination, trouble strikes in the form of a distress call from the Icarus I.We get to know each astronaut, and the actors portraying them, do a fine job. Cillian Murphy continues to impress with his acting abilities. If he stars in a movie, then I will almost certainly go and see it. Rose Byrne also continues to impress, as the quiet and shy Chrissy, along with Chris Evans who does a solid job as the conservative Mace.I went in with an open mind, and I'm glad that I did, as I was able to enjoy the movie for the story line, and not the technology factor. You may recognise some hints from inspirations for this film, IE. 2001, Alien and Event Horizon, but for the most part, this film is a stand-out all to itself.If you are a fan of Sci-Fi, thrillers or just want to see good movie, then I would highly recommend Sunshine.

Plus it's based on an unexplored idea, among the numerous science-fiction/horror flicks. It would have been an extraordinary movie if the twist hadn't been revealed so early, but the result is strong though. Film is supported and improved by Murphy's performance, this time too visceral and intense. This is not the sum of Alien, Contact and so on, this is something opening new thematic and artistic grounds, without imploding into a corny melodrama.

		<fullReview>Okay, I should've know better, but I thought it sounded like it had an intelligent script, good visuals, and an interesting plot.Well, it had good visuals.Others have said the first 2/3 was good, then it degraded when it became a shaky-camera slasher movie.Not for me, it fell apart when I realized the "science" was so pathetically bad.1. Capa said "Between the boosters and the gravity of the sun the velocity of the payload will get so great that space and time will become smeared together and everything will distort. Everything will be unquantifiable." - There is no way to reach near-light speed under these circumstances. Sol doesn't have an event horizon. Was that a nod to the film by the same name?2. Icarus I is floating around (presumably in Solar orbit) and although they talk about deviating their trajectory to reach it, they never mention that they would need to expend literally tons of fuel to match speeds. Duh.3. How is it that Freddie Cruger, errr, Pinslasher, ummm, Pinbacker is o super-humanly strong? Just surviving for 7 years in a low-gravity, non-Earth environment without falling to one or another dietary deficiency would be amazing luck -- doing so and ending up with the strength Mr Universe is over the top.Ultimately, it was just laughable.Could they not afford to hire a mediocre high school science teacher to proof read this crap?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just plain silly.Poor screenplay, plot holes a 757 could fly through, stupid premise and irritating and inconsistent characters. I found the ending pretty much an incomprehensible attempt to close out the movie without a lot of real thought.Set the controls for the heart of the sun- and actually fly into it? Come on......Other than a few decent special effects, this is a movie I could very easily live without ever having viewed.As a Danny Boyle fan, I was very disappointed.JR</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointing bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of this big budget SF picture is a McGuffin: the sun is dying, so a crew of astronauts is sent with a big bomb to reboot the star. Oh yes, there was a previous mission but it didn't get there and nobody knows what happened to it.That's the setup for ... what? Not much. There's a series of events (one unlikely disaster follows upon another), but nothing in the way of an actual story. The characters are just types, not fully fleshed personalities. The picture drags from the first few minutes; I was glancing at my watch by the 20 minute mark. Although a lot of things blow up and characters are sacrificed, it still feels slow.It's very reminiscent of ALIEN in its structure, but completely lacks the suspense, the characterization, or the relentless pace that made ALIEN an enduring classic. SUNSHINE is an incoherent, muddled, confusing, pointless mess, the proverbial hour and forty-five minutes of my life I won't get back. Fortunately I shortened that a bit by fast forwarding through the last half hour of the film. Since it's all flashy visuals, I did not miss much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>first two thirds started to build towards something new | last third, crash and burn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>can anyone say event horizon rip off. i watched this film expecting, or hoping rather, to see a new era science fiction film. i can honestly say that short of AVP requiem, this was the most disappointing sci-fi film i've seen in sometime. almost every sci-fi clique was used in this film. i've never commented before on any film on any board anywhere, but this film was so bad that i had to say something to someone. the worst part is that there are good actors in the flick. which probably was just because danny boyle was the director. but actors these days really need to think about the story they're telling before they commit. i mean really, did any of them see event horizon? the burnt ship captain even looked like a sam neil clone from event horizon. and i'll admit, event horizon wasn't a very good to me the first time i saw it either, but it was played so much on cable for years that i grew to like it's dark sinister take on sci-fi. sunshine to me looks like a film that was done by someone whose sole inspiration was mission to mars 'crap by the way' and even horizon. so while this comment may never be read by anyone, i thought i'd drop this because one, i'm bored, and two, this movie sucked. bottom line is that i'm tired of watching movies that look like there going to be fresh and new, and they just end up being a scrambled up take of multiple movie that you've already seen. will someone please be original!?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people who have seen this film complain about the film's third act because it turns into a big old horror/slasher flick. It did turn into that, but honestly, WHO CARES? I thought it was fine and made the movie much scarier. And I honestly don't think they could've made it any different. Maybe the crew just screws up and something breaks and everything goes to crap. Basically the same thing. As if someone went crazy and started killing everyone. So people, stop complaining and enjoy the movie for how great it is! I love this movie! I recommend it to anyone who likes a great sci-fi film with some horror elements that I thoroughly enjoyed and amazing acting!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nothing makes sense, no one has a brain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing in this film really makes any sense. I like a film to justify itself by it's own rules rather than contradict itself. It's set only 50 years in the future. to put that into perspective it's 40 years since man went to the moon - and just look at the advances man has made in space travel since then... err.So we're meant to believe that we launch this bomb 'the size of Manhatten Island' to the sun in 50 years. Chemistry isn't about to change so let's put that into perspective too. The rough guide for the mass of modern vehicles plus fuel launching a payload to the moon is about 100 to 1. i.e. to send 1kg to the moon it would take about 100kg of fuel. So how much does the huge hemispherical nuclear bomb weigh? Nukes are made from plutonium or uranium so if the flat side has an area equal to Manhattan (30km2) then this thing would weigh about 4523,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons (where will we get that much Uranium from???). And there were supposed to be TWO of these, right? So if we double this weight and then times it by 100 we'll know how much fuel we need to launch them...1810,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons of fuel - or to put into context one third of the mass of the Earth. Ein minuten bitte!? We've come a very long way in 50 years.So will Mankind prove itself to be superhumanly intelligent and resourceful? No, it turns out we'll be neolithically stupid. Having achieved our greatest accomplishment of re-writing physics &amp; constructing and launching this behemoth of spacecrafts we'll entrust its running and management to the stupidest, most flawed supercomputer ever created and an immature and seemingly categorically untrained crew.The crew fight like small children rather than behaving like the worlds greatest scientists and astronauts and they don't seem to know what to do in any situation. In fact given any choice, regardless of complexity, they consistently get it wrong to the point where it's annoying. They have no protocol or check list for anything. NASA has a protocol for practically any scenario. In 50 years this will be very different. If you make a minor course correction, your wonderful supercomputer wont provide comprehensive results with all the bases covered, safety margins and procedures won't be automated or even alerted. Instead you will be allowed to unwittingly tilt your ship into the direct glare of the sun where it will be irreparably damaged.Conversely when you go out and try to assess and repair your craft, the computer will suddenly have an attack of concern for its vessel (why now? is the computer TRYING to kill the crew? oh, they've already made that film - 2001) and shift you into the Sun's rays killing and almost killing the two most crucial members of the crew (of the entire crew why the !"?# are those two chosen to go out?) At every turn this crew make the worst decision available to them. The reason for the computer changing position of the ship is not apparent to the crew at first - they have to search to find this contentious information. It turns out that their only means of providing oxygen is engulfed in flames - well thanks for letting us know, what a well designed computer they have! Also there is no way to extinguish their only 'oxygen room'. Well thought through this ship.So now they're thoroughly !"?#ed, but they have a plan, they'll hack into the ship of the first failed mission to see if they can find their salvation. Here's the first good news of the film, it's intact and has food, water &amp; oxygen, Yey! But then, for some reason, the film makers decide to introduce a super-villain. One of the previous crew has survived (this information is omitted by the inconceivably inept computer of course) and has somehow been transformed in to a serial killing monster of great physical strength through being flayed alive, presumably from over exposure to sunlight.OK, I'm not buying it any more! It's getting toward the end of this stupid movie (or so I hoped) and suddenly it's turned into a more crappy version of Event Horizon! but for some reason I keep watching. We must assume the Sun Monster is a human, but there's no explanation as to why he can survive with no skin and its supposed to be over 6 YEARS since the first ship disappeared - There is no implied supernatural element to the film, it's reality is supposedly based on science. 6 years without skin, what is this? Buffy the Vampire Slayer? Do the writers think the audience is completely stupid? We can save a fortune on hospital care now that it turns out we don't need burns units any more! And more good news, we'll actually be STRONGER without skin! Wahoo! In the end the though, the demon is finally vanquished and the last surviving idiot deploys the ridiculous bomb. The bomb goes off with him inside it (well by this time I certainly wanted them all to die) but he doesn't get the kindness of an instant death, we are warned earlier in the film that the laws of physics may be different within the star (about the only time the film follows up on its own logic) and our 'hero' gets to watch the bomb from the inside as it explodes in spectacular, inevitable, beautiful super-slow motion. Whether he is burned alive in equally exquisite slow motion we don't get to see.Fantastic special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie 10 - minutes, that is, before pulling it out of the player and flinging it across the room. This united nations cast (something we're getting used to from London based directors) really belongs to its UNICEF wing, insofar as everybody seems to be about nineteen years old. The most important mission in history and all earth can muster for a crew are bunch of post adolescent smart alecks. On the other hand, who cares what ages they are if they can actually ACT like they understand the mission's importance? The Chinese woman seems to have trouble even articulating her English, let alone conveying something like artistry with it. I'd never heard of the lead, Curtis, before, but I really began to groan when I realized that this non-descript bore was going to have to carry the film. What was Boyle thinking of? Effects? Politics? Philosophy? Well of course all this and more, but anything but DRAMA. The scene with the dweeb sending his perhaps final message home was unbearably inane. I, too, have a final message - for Danny Boyle: put this and all your pretentious efforts where the sun don't shine!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen 2001, Silent Running, Event Horizon, Dark Star or Alien, you might enjoy this film. Otherwise you'll just find your mind continually wandering back to the previous films. If you've seen them then avoid this one, as they're much better films (yes even Event Horizon).As stated in previous reviews, the FX are very good, but that alone isn't enough to save this film.I read that Alex Garland wanted the film to be about meeting god. It's a shame he didn't want to inject some humour and more action into the story also, because its quite heavy going.I'm amazed that Danny Boyle has produced such a turgid and morose (quite boring) film (by his standards that is).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Want To See Sunshine Again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailers for this film, I thought that it was going to be an enormous joke, like most other space movies. I thought the physics would be non-existent, and that the actors would make me laugh when I should be crying. Instead, I found this film to be exactly the opposite. The cast was absolutely amazing, the physics entirely plausible, and the cinematography is beauty without comparison.If you read most of the bad reviews of this movie, you will notice that the complaints were mostly about the physics or a plot that resembles swiss cheese. I am a chemical engineering major, and I can tell you that there is only one thing wrong with the physics - the unexplained gravity on the ship. I'm pretty sure that we can all forgive Mr. Boyle this little bit of fantasy. It is science-fiction after all. Most of the people who complained obviously didn't spend even the slightest amount of time investigating the science of the film, otherwise they would have discovered that everything is completely probable.The special effects of Sunshine are breathtaking in their power and beauty. They are not overdone, like in most sci-fi films. Everything meshes extremely well and everything looks real, not contrived or surreal. CGI is supposed to enhance a film, not detract from it and that is exactly how Sunshine utilizes them. Considering that the budget for the film was around $50 million, these effects easily top those of most other sci-fi/fantasy films like Lord of the Rings and Pirates of the Caribbean.The acting ensemble could not have been better. Every single character perfectly portrayed. As a viewer, I was completely wrapped up in the moment and I completely forgot that the people were stars from major Hollywood films, which is what marks the greatest actors of our time.Capa (Cillian Murphy) actually acts like a physicist (I know a few and he has the mannerisms down). He is calculating, cautious, and introspective. He also possesses an edge that can rub people the wrong way. Everything about his performance is completely realistic. Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada) commands your attention even though he probably has the least amount of screen time. Corazon (Michelle Yeoh) gives us a great performance with the few lines that she speaks. Her love of the plants, awkward as much as that sounds, is ingrained in everything she is and does not seem unreal for even one second. Searle (Cliff Curtis) and Trey (Bennedict Wong) are also entirely convincing. Harvey (Troy Garity), jerk that he is, also delivers a great performance. Cassie was done extremely well by Rose Byrne. Even though she is my least favorite character because she would not give the vote to Mace, she shines just as brightly as the rest of them in terms of believability.Special recognition has to be given to Chris Evans for his phenomenal performance as Mace. Mace was, by far, my favorite character. I could relate to everything he said and did. I will be an engineer soon and I know plenty of engineers. We are pragmatic, efficient, and sometimes irritable and abrasive. He never loses his focus after his promise to himself following the fight with Capa. He knows what is most important and shows this throughout the film with his decision that many will find cold. Many will see him as apathetic and cold, but I believe he keeps his feelings inside because he knows that they would only endanger the mission. He also saves the mission the most of any crew member (oxygen garden fire, jump from Icarus I to II, very end when he repairs most vital computer sections). His death scene is probably my favorite scene ever, because it is so powerful. He knows how insignificant he is and he gives his life to save everyone. It felt so real that I felt as if my heart had been grabbed by some unseen person. Chris Evans was actually in water that was just above freezing, so his chattering teeth and some of the stutters are real. I hope that there will be more movies in which we can see the amazing talent that Mr. Evans has to offer.The plot of the movie moves very quickly and can be confusing for some. The plot is good enough to entertain people who take it as it is given, and there is an enormous amount of room for interpretation for the people who love to analyze things to find a deeper meaning. I'm an engineering student so I obviously like math and science, but I would probably enjoy writing an English class-style analysis of this movie because it is so deep and meaningful. It is psychological and spiritual pay dirt for anyone who wants to write that type of paper.Sorry to be so wordy. It just shows how much I admire this film. It is amazing. I would say that everyone should see it, but I know that a lot of people would not like it for the various reasons mentioned above. It is easily my favorite movie. I doubt that it will be displaced anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great start -- but the film gets drunk midway, and wakes up forgetting what it was. I can't say more without revealing plot information, but basically that's the problem with the film. If only they had stuck to the original formula!Some of the technology and ideas in the movie remind you that it could almost be as innovative as 2001, but the rest of the movie falls flat on its face. Additionally, unlike 2001, there are numerous technology bits that simply make no sense -- or are better left unexplained. Otherwise, the film had a very interesting premise, and was very much a psychological thriller for the majority of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some movies are so bad they're good, some movies are plain bad, and some movies are Sunshine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm trying hard to think of alternatives, but i think this is the worst movie I've ever seen. That said, I'm pretty generous when it comes to reviewing movies, I can normally look past problems and just get a few laughs, or shocks, or whatever out of a mediocre move and then be happy. But Sunshine not only disappointed me, but it enraged me that such a thing could be.The first thing that hit me was massive lack of realism. I already knew the story was about the sun going out, but I didn't mind that too much, a movie is allowed to bend physics for the sake of plot, but when a reported brightness increase from 2% to 3.1% changed from a dim glow to blinding white any suspension of disbelief I could have ever attempted was crushed. Still, it may have been jarring, things such as the &gt;1 year journey that is inside earths orbit also jarred me, but other than that first one I don't think the average viewer should have noticed, and unreal-ism, even in the case of this movie, shouldn't lose more than 1 point from movie's score, rather it was the plethora of other problems that doomed Sunshine.While still not absolutely crushing the movie, the characters themselves certainly ensured it could never get a rating better than "semi-decent". The characters showed the average intelligence and foresight of a dead maggot. these problems ranged from the relatively benign; such as when near the start of the movie a crew member did all the necessary procedures for changing the ship's course entirely on his own, not even asking another crew member to skim his work for problems; to the absolutely ridiculous "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it". That quote comes from a section where one of the crew decides to angle the deflector in such a way that a portion of the ship will be annihilated with 100% certainty. The rationale behind this decision (and the quote) was that "they weren't using that part of the ship at the moment". Many other such things happened, some even more ridiculous, such as venting the entire oxygen supply into a fire so it will burn faster, with no real reason given exactly why they would want that, though "We'll cross that bridge" was a personal favourite.Even with the above massive stupidities (which seem to be the main driving force for the movie's plot) the movie still would have had a chance for maybe 3 or 4 out of 10, but alas, it was not to be. the movie's plot firmly cemented it in the "Avoid this movie at all costs" zone. The plot starts out simple and understandable, deliver the Dues Ex mechina to the sun, it soon takes a twist, that under normal circumstances would add to a movie, by finding the previous, failed mission to the sun. At this point everything is as you should expect, problems arise, the crew has to fix problems, think of a sci-fi version of Apollo 13, except really bad. It could have still gotten 2/10 at this point, at least it would be reminiscent of a great movie, but at this point the plot turns to "We need to kill crew members to conserve oxygen!" and it carries this plot worse than your average fan-fiction. At this point my mind wandered to how this movie could have gotten one extra star if it had asked an interesting question, such as if humanity is worth saving if it will so readily kill it's own (still a questionable question). Instead, it asks a flat and simple "Is the crew more important than the mission?" and before you can think it answers "No! The mission is all-important!" in what seems like a bad ripoff of 2001 or (less related to the main plot) Alien. None of that matters though, because at the end it turns into "There's a madman on the ship!!!!" (More Alien allusion?) complete with scary sound and visual effects.There were other problems, such as generally confusing parts, (Looks like he made it to the other part of the ship only for it to explode.... oh, wait, turns out he was going the other way!) tonnes of sections that seem directly ripped from other movies, ("I'm sorry unmemorable crew member #1, I can't let you do that", but don't worry, it's only HAL for one scene) and parts that just didn't seem to make sense (Why did the hydroponics section catch fire? and why didn't the computer warn them 'till half an hour later).Finally, what could have been the redeeming factor of the movie, if it was redeemable at all, were the special effects. Even then they were "neat" but nothing to write home about, and for those hoping for a fancy flashy colourful special effect when the "Plot Device" activates at the end, there isn't one, seems you just can't win.For me, the highlight of this movie was being able to write the summary for this comment, and I think that should speak louder than anything else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth it for the visuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third film spawned from the brains of Danny Boyle (director) and Alex Garland (writer). After the success of The Beach and 28 Days Later I was expecting great things, and on many levels Sunshine didn't disappoint.The plot is this: 50 years into the future and our sun is "dying". A team of scientists and astronauts are sent into space on a mission right to the surface of said provider of light in order to deploy a bomb the size of Manhattan to "kick start" said giver of life back into action. Along the way they pick up a distress signal from the failed mission of seven years earlier and debate whether to alter their course to reach this vessel. In a plot that cannot help trigger memories of the brilliant Russian film Solaris, however, all is not as it seems and the crew one by one succumb to a mysterious presence.Like so many films of this genre (2001 springs to mind), the plot is secondary to the stunning visuals and cinematography that make Sunshine a must for the big screen. That said, the story is not to be dismissed and is remarkably, for a sci-fi at least, almost completely devoid of plot holes and erroneous science.Good performances all round from the small cast, Cillian Murphy (28 days Later) giving a strong lead. However, the characters are a little bit weak and devoid of any depth, a trait I have found in nearly all of Boyle's films. The film also falls down a bit at the end, with the final third being too confusing and out of step with the beginning to keep the audience feeling 100% involved. It was almost as if the budget was running out and the producers said "right, lets hurry up with getting this film done." I don't normally give films a rating but if pushed I would give it a 7/10. Definitely worth watching, if only for the amazing opening sequence, but could have been better if more attention had been paid in pre-production. It seems Garland, not Boyle is the weak link in this case, opposite to the situation that let The Beach fall down slightly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film ? 8 out of 10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked Sci-Fi movies like 2001, The day the earth stood still and K-Pax you should enjoy this type of Sci-Fi movie, however if you prefer great action packed Sci-Fi movies like Armageddon and Aliens then this might not be for you.Going into this movie I kept thinking of the movie The Core, restart the earths core spinning... restart our Sun from fading...I needn't worried about comparing the two films any further. Sunshine is more 2010 (the sequel to 2001) with a touch of Event Horizon. I went and saw this movie last night while on holiday in Sydney, Australia! A great choice in cities for watching this movie in! This was a good movie, worth watching but not what I would call brilliant or a masterpiece; everything was great in this philosophical and suspenseful Sci-Fi flick from the stunning visuals and design, superb acting, bold editing right through to the incredible modern music score. Great creative directing in putting it all together! The first two thirds of the film takes you on a fantastic ride with the final third of the movie introduces a horror element and some bold editing which got the audience in the entire cinema whispering to one another.However I felt the script could have been improved??. and if you can put this aside (SPOILERS BELOW) as quickly as I did you will enjoy this movie.SPOILERS A) We have been sending probes and satellites into space remotely for the past 40 years. Why was the crew needed for this mission? Surely the payload could have been sent remotely B) Could a nuclear payload the size of Manhattan really achieve anything in the Sun, the theory of how this would work wasn't really explained? C) With the spacecrafts computer being able to tell the crew exactly where everyone is, wouldn't it have alerted them to the fact that an unknown person had bordered the spacecraft while docked with the old spacecraft? or to the fact that a crew member had committed suicide or possibly been killed while another was being murdered? Instead the computer waited until it was asked a direct question.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been said that Sunshine contains themes of the eternal struggle between science and religion, but in fact there is more of a suggestion of the parallel between the two as out in space, travelling ever closer to the ball of flaming gas, it is apparent that the sun, life giver and preserver, is God to both the rational and the madly religious. The closer they get in their journey, the more blurred the distinction becomes as even the most rational of the scientific team aboard the Icarus 2 begin to lose it. Matters are not exactly helped by wondering what could have happened to the Icarus 1, their predecessors who have spent seven years in such close contact to the burning star.The basic plot line and set-up of Sunshine is pretty typical of this kind of sci-fi, Boyle and Garland's sources and inspirations are numerous and obvious, with critics comparing Sunshine to everything from Alien to the dire Red Planet. However, it is in their handling of this common, almost clichéd, set-up that elevates Sunshine to the status of modern sci-fi classic. Firstly, although the plot structure may seem familiar, Sunshine is very original in its use of the sun itself as both destination point and villain of the story. The film combines very real scientific concerns about the star's ability to permanently provide humanity with life and metaphysical ideas of what the sun is to us given how much it rules our lives.The incredible strength and power of the sun, both its danger and alluring qualities are quickly established by an opening that has the ship's psychiatrist Searle bathing in the bright glow of the sun's light on the Icarus' observation deck, even with barely three percent of the sun's light allowed through he is surrounded and consumed by the light, entering into a trance like state. Through the course of the film, Searle appears more and more sunburnt, a physical manifestation of how the sun's power has got its grip on him, the path he is heading down becoming disturbingly obvious at the time when the crew discover the the first Icarus and the fate of its crew. Comparisons have been made with Stanley Kubrick's 2001, however the ideas about God and the source of life in Garland's script are really an undercurrent, something that means you will think about the film long after it is over.In fact, for the most part, Sunshine is simply a gripping thriller. Boyle and Garland both centre the film around their favoured theme of small, tight communities disintegrating into madness and violence as a new element comes in to split them apart. The film opens when the ship is just about to lose contact with Earth, earlier than expected and a minor inconvenience that is the first of many troubles they are about to run into, and the tension between the crew members is already mounting. The crew are made up of semi-familiar faces, the stand-outs being Cillian Murphy's physicist, the intense stare that has got him Hollywood villain roles well suggesting how he is losing his mind, and Chris Evans as engineer Mace, initially the annoying, macho one whose pragmatic views on sacrificing crew members in order to complete the mission become more sympathetic than harsh as the misfortunes pile up.Boyle, much influenced by Alien focuses on the Icarus' long, creepy corridors and the creaking sounds of the ship to bring in the tension. Indeed, Sunshine is one of those films where everything, even the characters' breathing is expertly managed by the director on order to wring out the maximum suspense. The film also has a tight focus on the ship and its small crew, not cutting back to events on Earth until the sentimental but powerful and effecting final moments and runs along at a thrilling breakneck pace that makes a pleasant change from so many bloated sci-fi epics.Intelligent and gripping it may be, but Sunshine's main strength is in its design. This is a film that really must be seen in the cinema as the incredible sight and sound-scape need to be seen in widescreen and surround sound. Given its low budget for such a production, the effects are dazzling, putting many films with three or four times the money behind them to shame. The very opening moments are dazzling as the distant sun comes ever closer to the screen only to be revealed as a reflection in the Icarus' huge reflective shield, revealing the ship as it flies past the camera. The film has some of the single greatest use of CGI in any film. Given how hard fire is supposed to animate, it is amazing that they have made the sun not only look real but stunningly beautiful as well as managing to create a very real sense of a changing landscape as the ship draws closer to the sun. Meanwhile, the cold electric light inside the ship is brilliantly contrasted with the fiery orange glow of everything lit by the sun. Nothing in Garland's script manages to convey the beauty, power and danger of the sun quite like the visuals of the film. Sunshine's score is equally stylish and effecting and works brilliantly in tandem with the visuals so that the finest moments in the film, for all Garland's intelligent ideas as a writer, are those that are totally wordless.Unfortunately, the budgetary limitations do come into play as the film goes the same way as Boyle and Garland's previous work and descends into rather more conventional horror-thriller territory. It is clear from the irritatingly shaky camera methods with which Boyle shoots these scenes that the special effects just were not available to them, which is a shame because this is the only major flaw with an otherwise stylish and beautiful piece of film-making that will prove gripping in the cinema and thought provoking for days to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>nothing new, another long time mission in space, crew inter-personal problems, no personage characterizations, the usual expected unexpected events, the intrusion (no one should use spaceship intrusion after Alien, it is so predictable), the final sacrifice ... very annoying, no new idea, no new filming technique, no surprise, ... so what was this movie worth for ... !? no interesting music soundtrack, no definition of character of Icarus 1 captain and intruder in Icarus 2, you can't even see him well anytime. Maybe actors make their best but the screenplay is nothing even if the plot is interesting. Some ideas taken form Space Odissey (the computer speaking voice distortion for example) sounds like a sacrilege in this context. And completely out of place too (Science Fiction today should be different from 40 years ago, right ?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Borrows Widely and Wisely - More Fi than Sci</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If, 15 years ago, you were to tell me that the director of Trainspotting and Shallow Grave would make a film about a human effort to save the solar system from a sun on the verge of extinction, I would have questioned your sanity. But here it is.Danny Boyle's first (and let's hope it's not his last) space adventure is the closest thing to hardcore sci-fi I have seen in the last couple of years. Based on the scientific fact that our sun will die at some point (between 4.5 and 7 billion years from now according to most estimates), the film turns the usual sci fi cliché - "dont mess with mother nature" - on its head and asks what would happen if we don't. However, this is really the only profound point 'Sunshine' works toward, and I am not even sure its treatment was intentional. The film is really a high-stakes heroic thriller that just happens to be set dangerously close to the sun on a space-ship named after an ancient mythological Greek who flew too high and too close. The science and tech are pretty far away from reality, but the film shouldn't be evaluated as a documentary.The cast is bound for a rendezvous with Sol to deliver an explosive device and reignite the dying sun. Ridiculous from an astronomical point of view, entirely absurd in terms of evolution (given the time span between then and now), but interesting allegorically and certainly an original premise. Predictably, things start to go wrong aboard the Icarus as they get closer to their destination. But why? The cinematography and effects are excellent and suggestive of a budget well above the $24 million Boyle had to work with. The cast is also very good. Cillian Murphy does a very nice job with the lead - and I was pleased to see this talented actor moving out of his typecast and showing his range. Michelle Yeoh also gets out of her own cinematic skin for a very nice supporting role, and Chris Evans is very memorable as erstwhile hero Mace.Sci fi fans will recognize several scenes and plot devices lifted from classic and semi-classic space adventures like Alien, 2001, Outlander and Event Horizon. Although the film owes a debt to its predecessors for cinematography, Sunshine is also an original in its own right. As the film transforms itself from space adventure to standard thriller, some will feel as if they've seen this too many times before. Nevertheless, I was thoroughly entertained and will recommend this film to sci-fi fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im not really into sci films, because they really seem to bore me, and do not have any meaning. This movie changed my mind,I went to see this movie with an open mind, without knowing nothing about it, i mean i haven't seen trailer for it even. Surprisingly i was shocked, this movie was amazing, the acting was tremendous, the story line was really good,and overall the movie was well directed and well done. The reason i gave it 9/10 and not 10/10 was because it bugged me that this movie was not more advertised if it was it would have made much more money and brought more attention to people.Of course thats no reason not to watch it. Do watch this film because it is very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every review I've read of this film mentions other films ? chiefly Alien, Event Horizon, 2001, Dark Star and Solaris. And, it's gotta be said ? they are all fair comparisons. However, Sunshine is a great example of how a film does not need to be original or inventive to be exciting and enjoyable. Very much a claustrophobic slow-burner (like, well, like Alien), the direction from Danny Boyle is top notch, and the performances of the whole cast are on the money, with Chris Evans possibly the stand out. The last half hour goes ever so slightly awry, and the film could have had an extra half hour inserted in the first half to flesh things out without losing its pace, but overall this is classy stuff and if you like semi-intelligent sci-fi with an action edge, then this could be for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was the worst Sci-Fi movie I have seen in a long long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to say I saw Sunshine over the weekend, and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this was the worst movie I saw all year, and certainly the worst Sci-Fi movie I have seen this millennium (It was actually worse than Millennium the movie, BTW).Spoiler Rant! First of all, just getting beyond the terrible premise: we must jump start the Sun! I wish it were explained just a tiny little bit as to why our Sun, which is supposed to last another billion years at least, all of a sudden started to fizzle out, and how this magical bomb, which is 1/billionth the volume of Earth (which is 1/billionth the size of the Sun) can actually make any sort of difference other than that of a lonely raindrop falling into the Pacific Ocean.But OK, I'll swallow the implied scientific gobbledygook.But the rest of the movie totally doesn't make sense. Again, they're the ONLY hope humanity has - everything has been vested into their success, and then halfway through the mission they're like, hey it's the first Icarus, what do we do? WHAT DO WE DO?? Whatever was decided during mission prep, where they went over such mundane topics like what if we run into the first Icarus. And the whole changing course thing, like we changed course but didn't align the shields and now we're all going to die. Nice how Humanity's Only Hope Spaceship is essentially flown by a guy with a joystick. How about the computer going we can't do this thing because of the shield you stupid human? No, I guess backup systems and warning alarms and routines are for pussies.Then this whole other Icarus thing. If Icarus One is basically OK except for the dust and the dead crew, why don't they just switch ships? They'll get the bomb and the working bio sphere and can return to Earth.Then this Icarus One Burned Guy. OK OK, I'll accept the mundane premise that the old Captain blew a fuse and burned himself severely and his crew fatally because God told him humanity wasn't worth saving. But how come we can't see him clearly? Every time the camera is on the guy it's fuzzy, out of focus, with blur effects and slow mo. WTF? The dude is just a burned guy, not some mystical energy being (oh wait, could it be the burned guy special effects were just so awful that they had to blur them cause otherwise people would just laugh?).How about the Truly Useless Observation Room? Hey let's build a room where we can stare into the Sun! Maybe we can ever burn ourselves to death in it! Or the Awfully Complicated Shielding! The captain dies because they have to repair four awfully complicated things (with motors and levers!) out of what looks like ten thousand complicated things that make up their Sun shield. Umm, I'm just a backward 21th century guy, but shouldn't shields be like, one-piece? Like one giant piece of metal would be better than ten thousand cobbled-together motorized panels that move and break down and jeopardize the One Hope? Oh, another thing, so we build a ship, a great big complicated ship, and we send it to the Sun. Ooops, it disappears and all contact is lost. Well, we gotta try again. It takes seven years, but gosh darn it, we did it! We build a giant identical ship, the same in every respect to the ship that mysteriously disappeared before. Because whatever caused the first mission to fail obviously didn't have anything to do with the ship or it's design, not with Space Ghosts and Anomalies and that dude, what's his name, Maximillian Schell, stuck in the black hole with his evil robot.Horrible. Terrible. A film which seems to intentionally grab you out of whatever minimal suspension of disbelief it has managed to generate up that point just so it can shove it's obvious arrogance and stupidity right in your face, just like the giant communications antenna, slowly going WHOOSH, WHOOSH, in empty space.D minus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is certainly the most allegorical and metaphorical science fiction film to come out since Children of Men, and it's probably the best film released since then. On the surface, it's not that special, as it basically melds various sci-fi sub-genres ? space adventure, natural disaster, and psychological horror ? but it infuses its familiar story with symbolism, subtext, and a much deeper meaning. Even the sharp turn toward horror in the final act, which is jarring, doesn't stray from the overall message. Every part of the film, from the story to the characters to the visuals, works towards its common theme, and that makes it a very powerful experience.I don't know if I've got a hold on all the issues and implications raised by the film, but I was certainly affected by them. Even now, days later, I still find myself thinking about the true, overall meaning behind it. Most of these thoughts focus on Pinbacker, and his role in the film. Superficially, he's the villain, but he's only introduced in the second half of the film. Half the crew are already dead by the time he boards the Icarus II. Many of the criticisms deal with his character: not only that he appears to be a generic serial killer, but that his actual appearance is impossible to nail down. Every shot of him is blurred, out-of-focus, constantly moving. All we can make out is an impossibly burned body and a raspy, chilling voice. In order to reconcile his bizarre presentation with his narrative significance, the viewer must see him as no longer a human, but something more. A godlike figure, perhaps, or maybe even a supernatural being. It would explain his paranormal presence, as well as his fundamentalist rantings. If he is not a god, then it's possible that he's instead a disciple of God, sent to derail the mission and preserve the destruction of humanity. This would imply that God Himself is responsible for the dying sun, and this is His way of cleansing Earth of our parasitic race. A modern-day flood, if you will, with no Ark to save us ? unless you consider the Icarus itself to be that vessel. I could go on for days about the dozens of interpretations one can draw from this film.It's interesting, then, to look at the cast of characters and where they fit into the grand scheme of things. Even relatively minor characters, who are offed fairly quickly, are given their moment in the sun (so to speak). One can observe the divide among the eight crew members ? those concerned with trivial human matters, and those who can see the bigger picture. Along these lines, I would consider Corazon, Trey, Mace, and Harvey to fall into the first category, leaving Searle, Cassie, Kaneda, and of course Capa in the latter category. It's unusual to note that the characters are not separated according to the typical science/faith debate ? none of the characters express their belief in God or some other higher power, and Capa ? a man of science ? sits in opposition to many of the other scientific members of the team. The divide is present many times throughout the film, most notably regarding their views on the detour to the original Icarus, and can be seen overtly in regards to their deaths. Each of the characters in the first category, those obsessed with the triviality of humanity, die cold, alone, and ? most importantly ? against their will. They are afraid of death, and thus their deaths are meaningless, a sacrifice for nothing. Conversely, those in the second category, those whose minds are open and able to 'see the light', die in heat, in light, reverently admiring that which ends up killing them, whether it be star or bomb. Indeed, Capa's expression as he marvels at the execution of the peak of human knowledge mirrors the look of Kaneda or Searle as they idolize the full, unbridled Sun ? arguably the peak of nature, or God's creation if you prefer. This film is not a debate between faith and science, but it attempts to show a reconciliation between the two.Furthermore, from a technical point of view, the film is near-perfect. As mentioned before, the presentation of Pinbacker is bizarre and yet truly fitting for the character. Boyle's excellent direction doesn't stop there, though. The wide shots of the spacecraft are simply stunning, and the broad, looping movements of the camera as it rotates around express the size of the ship appropriately. The portrayal of physical spaces within the ship, especially in the last half-hour, perfectly provide a claustrophobic atmosphere even within an expansive environment. The quick flashes of the original Icarus crew as the new crew enters the adrift vessel is very unsettling and disturbing, and amp up the suspense and horror to unbearable heights. Similarly, the silhouetted shot of Pinbacker interwoven with Capa slowly discovering that he is on board is a truly terrifying moment. And that's not to mention the incredible presence of the approaching Sun ? never before has that orb of life felt more real, or more dangerous.This is somewhat of a rarity in the sci-fi genre lately: an action-packed, horrifying film with real characters, a believable story, and layers upon layers of meaning. It's a real treat to experience, and I look forward to watching it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big bang in the science fiction genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine is a science fiction movie set in the not to distant future. It revolves around a series of astronauts and scientists going into space to reignite a dieing star with a bomb the size of Manhattan. So as you can already tell, this is not a movie for those who love to criticize and pin point problems, because like any science fiction movie you will find them. It's rather a movie for those who just love to sit back and enjoy the ride. Sunshie really explores the essence of human nature, peoples ability's to make decisions, and how we relate to one another in stressful situations. As the movie flows fourth, the characters are forced to face various different obstacles that challenge them both physically and mentally. This is an element which I think will appeal to a huge audience, and it is executed very well. The acting in sunshine is above par too, with characters that finally break off from the usual stereotypes and delve into some more interesting more believable people. Cilian Murphy is outstanding and surprisingly Chirs Evans is also very good in his supporting role. The main issues though with this movie however is that it is a tad formulaic and predictable, and I also found myself wondering why the whole crew was young and attractive, as it added nothing to the movie. However in saying this, the dialogue is good and there is definitely a fair bit of depth, in terms of storyline, characters , and meaning. In the end though, if you enjoy sci fi films , with some cool special effects, and a nice storyline then Sunshine is a must see, as it stands above most of the previous outer space flicks in nearly every aspect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought I would read, in the 15 or so reviews I read, at least one about the unbelievable science in this movie, or lack thereof. And maybe it is out there in the hundreds of reviews I didn't read. Or maybe this stuff is not such common knowledge? The first problem is, if the sun were 'dying', it would be a big surprise as it is only a little over halfway into its lifespan. Theory, sure, but based on pretty sound observations and physics. And if we were wrong about the life of the sun, and if did start to die 4 billion years too soon, it would expand until it engulfed the Earth, which would have been a great story, as Samuel Delaney wrote about so well in his award winning novel, Dhalgren. There is great character material at the end of all things, or the end of all things in this solar system, anyway. Just not in this movie.Next is the idea that humans, in the relatively near future, can kickstart the sun, ignoring the fact, which, I agree is very hard to grasp, that the size of and reactions within the sun, are so powerful and beyond anything we can truly grasp, or even engineer, that would affect it. Thus the whole premise of this movie is crazy. Think about it. If we can feel it so intensely and even get burned by it (or killed) NINETY-THREE *MILLION* miles away, well, enough said. Imagine then, if you were 93 million miles *closer*! As these guys are. I doubt things would go as they did here. I mean, seriously...Beyond the bad plot twists at the end, there is really bad science there, too, which I think people have realized, for the most part. Let's just say that anyone 'riding' a bomb into the sun would not be able to tell the story from their POV. That is just comical.This movie starts out, IF you forget the bad premise, fairly well and interestingly, as life in space, in the future, often does, but degrades completely from there into a confusing and silly film. Something happened, obviously, during production or post-production, to cause such a left turn to be taken. So if you either know nothing about astronomy or can suspend your belief about it, and beyond that, even figure out the left turn it takes and why, then enjoy, I guess. But this movie commits the very worst of sins, which is to hook people with the first few acts, only to dump them into the void, unceremoniously. Bah...grrrrr.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Sunshine does a Moviegoer Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine is a sci-fi adventure film about eight crew members who have the task of igniting the sun by throwing a nuclear bomb straight at the sun. It sounds simple enough right?Wrong, as this is not Earth's first attempt at reviving the fading star. Icarus the name of the first ship flew too close to the sun and lost communication with Earth (well who didn't see that coming!). On Icarus II as the film progresses the crew runs into more and more tough decisions about managing their resources so they can make it to their destination in the most efficient way possible. This all starts when the crew receives a signal from a ship nearby from the Icarus ship that most still be functional, and the crew comes to a consensus that retrieving that ship's bomb will give them the best chance to succeed.If I were to compare this movie to anything, I would say that Sunshine has similar aspects to the Alien franchise and Gravity. I say this because like Gravity, Sunshine brings the same vibe when the crew members venture outside the ship as it is pulse-pounding while at the same time visually beautiful. As for the comparison to Alien, the crew's chemistry as well as the movie's action scenes remind me of the first Alien installment. I will not dive into the action scenes as that would contain major spoilers, but the crew's chemistry just felt so believable to me, with the comic relief along with the way they start to attack each other when things are crumbling around them.The only downside to this movie is the believe-ability of the movies climax. I know it is a sci-fi movie, but there has to be a limit and this movie passes that limit. All in all this movie is still a must see in my eyes and I would rate it as an 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not advertised in North America. I did not even hear about it until I read something online about it. I walked in with not a clue of what the story line was like.This movie was visually breath taking. The visual effects used to show space and the sun was remarkable! Some of the death scenes were so emotionally thrilling that I can replay the scenes over and over in my head remembering every detail.The soundtrack that went with these beautiful CG scenes also made each scene that much more intense.The cast selected was amazing! Such a big cast with such little advertisement surprised me when watching this movie for the first time! Everybody played their roles very well to meet their expertise (unlike Prometheus.. ugh). From honorable samurai code from the Captain Kaneda, to the counter role of selfish Harvey. Each person brings a different role to the emotions we go through while watching the movie.The story line was phenomenal up until about the last 10% of the movie. This is where the movie really falls and goes from my all time favorite to a movie I really like.I agree with the ratings that this movie is roughly a 7 but boy could this movie could have been a 10!(SPOILERS AHEAD) If we continued to follow the crew and their struggles of reaching the Sun with more natural causing issues, (such as the mathematical error that Trey had, or the burning of the greenery which caused them to change their course) this would have been a much more sound story line. Instead we cut over from an elegant movie, with dramatic scenery and beautiful music, to a hack and slash scary movie. Like come on!! There was NO NEED for this part of the story line. If they had cut this out, throw in a couple of more wrenches to throw off the team this would have been the best movie of all time!Anyways, for the sake of how well the first 90% of the movie was done, I rate this a 9. The last 10% really brings the quality of the movie down. I just imagine what the story line could have been and am happy with my own interpreted endings.This movie is a must watch, mainly for the visual effects and background music.Loved it!</fullReview>

Things I liked were the idea itself, the acting, the effects, most of the story and the style. And also the a bit weird "mind-fuck"- scenes and the philosophic attempts. But there are way too much unnecessary characters and why the hell they tried to make a bit of a horror-movie after 2/3 of the movie?! Thats completely unnecessary, its disappointingly bad thrown in the story and not really scary, it's just there without any sense, the movie could have worked absolutely perfect if all the problems the crew had were cause of mistakes, getting insane, having computer- troubles or something like that, why they needed this "scary" "I am God"-Character. I liked the weird "mind-fuck"scenes as I said and in some ways I understand the idea of this character buts just badly made and could have worked very well without.But all in all it's a good to watch movie either, makes you a bit think, what I like, and has some nice effects, so its not a waste of time and you should give it a chance. But don't expect a movie like "Interstellar", "2001" or even "Moon", its just a good or at least "okay" Sci-Fi-Movie, which is quite nice to enjoy..</fullReview>

Alex Garland, who wrote and directed "Ex Machina" and wrote the also-Danny-Boyle- directed "28 Days Later," has a lot of talent.But, he makes writing decisions that don't work. Here, there is that "Gravity"-type problem of having one calamity after another happen to our hapless heroes.And, it gets to be too much. Also, the movie goes a bit too quickly, just like "Gravity," which, yeah, I know came afterward. But, still, they share that issue.Otherwise, the atmosphere and effects used are very evocative and impressive. You truly feel that you are out in space with these characters and what they go through. The cinematography and film score are also first rate.Still, the ending does get to be too much! (SPOILER) Having this superhuman-zombie character running amok completely strains credulity. But, it is rescued by the transcendent moment of Cillian Murphy meeting his fate in the nuclear fire. (END SPOILER)A very good movie. It just has its issues.******* (7 Out of 10 Stars)</fullReview>

But the final act seemed spliced in from a different--much, MUCH worse--film. It goes from a hard sci-fi drama about the tough choices made by a space crew in an effort to save mankind and morphs into a totally out of left field bit of cheap sci-fi horror.The cast is uniformly good, if not quite exceptional, and the cinematography, special f/x and music score are all top notch.

		<shortDescription>How do I put this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I watched Sunshine I began thinking to myself that it may just be one of the best films I had seen in a while, if not the best. Its effects were incredible, its action scenes as suspenseful as I had seen. I watched in awe of the blinding light of the sun and its total encompassing might juxtaposed against a claustrophobic, stressed spaceship. This spaceship, rather foolishly named 'Icarus 2' harbours 8 scientists on a galaxy spanning mission that aims to save the sun from burnout using the power of a nuclear fission bomb. The movie jumps straight into this grand premise, and from there the fear, terror and isolation of the character's grave mission is shown to eat away at them. The first hour or so of the movie is breathtaking and truly unpredictable. But then, the last 1/3 of the movie rolls around. I have no idea where Alex Garland and Danny Boyle ever thought they were going with Sunshine's final act, attempting to mix religious connotations into this sci fi film and switching genre from space adventure to a weirdly edited and confusing slasher flick. The homages paid to 2001 and alien at the end of the film are flattering if not completely unnecessary, and in truth the ending of the movie does stop this being a sci fi classic, and possibly explains the lack of recognition the film has gotten. Despite this, I am giving this film 9/10 as I believe the merits of its first hour do enough to elevate this above most sci fi movies, as well as the true ending (the last 5 minutes) doing a bit to detract from the oddness of the previous 30 minutes. Sunshine is a film that could have been a classic, that could have been Danny Boyle's best and could have been a groundbreaking film (After watching this and Interstellar, notice their similarities), yet, due to its final act, is a great film, rather than a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flows like concrete</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Boyle's Sunshine is a psychological thriller that investigates the impact of deep space travel on a crew assembled to save the world. The film develops around the fact that this is the second attempt to re-ignite the sun with a nuclear bomb by a ship (cringingly) called the Icarus.Boyle tries to plum the depths of human philosophy throughout; pessimism, empiricism, Christianity, Eastern religions etc. etc. However this kaleidoscope of views just clutters the film and can at times bring the pacing of the film to a standstill. Dialogue in the film is just as clunky, sometimes the crew talk to each other like human beings, other times they shoehorn their beliefs in and it all comes across as contrived. Also the film feels schizophrenic when it comes to plot; the first two acts are psychological, the last act feels like a slasher flick. Such a rapid change in tone in the film was distracting, and the conclusion to the film barely resolved the films main plot lines.Casting for the film was definitely one of the stronger points of the film. Considering what nations have space programs and what type of professions would be sent into space, this definitely felt well thought out, and well executed. Apparently before the film even started the cast was made spend a significant amount of time with one another (16 months) and this certainly gives a natural feeling of connection and tension. The script, however, extremely limits the actors impression on the film. While I did enjoy especially watching Cillian Murphy and Chris Evans, it just felt like they were crushed under the weight of a bad script.Visually this is possibly is one my least favourite Danny Boyle films. Some of the sets are quite striking, and the CGI is used quite sparingly, and gives a gritty visual tone to the film. The hand-held camera shots though, felt clumsy, one scene in particular feels like the camera fell and they just kept on shooting. Some of the imaginary and symbolism also felt hackneyed. I am use to heavy Christian symbolism in Boyle movies, but this one literally felt like a check-list, and I felt myself mentally ticking them off as them came along.Despite all this I am not saying that I hated this film, it is possibly one of the better films of the disaster movie genre. However compared to other Boyle films and other Sci-fi films; this movie smacks of mediocrity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sol about the Star...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SUNSHINE starts off with some absolutely beautiful scenes: Cilian Murphy's message to his family, the scene where the ship's Captain sits mesmerized by the sight of Sol, etc.- but it takes a turn for the worse maybe halfway through and it never recovers. The premise we can buy (because it's a Fantasy, after all, and it's kinda hard to watch a Fantasy if you're unwilling to buy into the Basic Premise), but it's the sudden veering away from what makes the first part of the movie so compelling that's hard to reconcile. (The musings of the various crew members brought to mind the ramblings of the burnt-out crew in John Carpenter's DARK STAR- and the introduction of a character called "Pinbacker" suggests that DARK STAR was, indeed, an influence.) This one could very easily have been one of the Great Ones; unfortunately, it's not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>terrific vision from Danny Boyle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 50 years in the future. Eight astronauts on Icarus II are sent to restart the Sun as it begins to die. Icarus I was lost seven years ago for unknown reasons. Communications Officer Harvey (Troy Garity) finds a distress call from Icarus I. Psychiatrist Searle (Cliff Curtis) recommends to rendezvous despite engineer Mace (Chris Evans)'s objection for the extra bomb. Physicist Capa (Cillian Murphy) reluctantly agrees. Navigator Trey (Benedict Wong) miscalculates the new trajectory and Captain Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada) is killed. Trey goes crazy and is sedated. They board Icarus I leaving pilot Cassie (Rose Byrne) and botanist Corazon (Michelle Yeoh) on Icarus II.Director Danny Boyle uses the sun as a visual effect and it's amazing. The look of it is beautiful and industrial. The cast is intriguing. The movie is reminiscent of Alien and then it tries to follow it into slasher horror. That may have been a mistake. I'm more concerned about the confused nature of the last act. However I just love the look and feel of this world.</fullReview>

Well there are some truly nice looking scenes and soundtrack but it was a true waste in my opinion.If you wanna watch a scary movie where everyone just dies then make one in a haunted house or something like that no need to take this in outer space, a science thriller?

		<shortDescription>A brilliant sci-fi thriller......which then devolves into a disastrous slasher humiliation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Halloween 'Horror' Reviews #5)This is one of the most rage inducing films I will cover this month. The first two-thirds are a beautifully written and cerebral science fiction masterpiece. However at around the two-thirds mark, it changes and drops all of its clever aspects and ideas.Before I cover this, I'll talk about the films promising start. The films cast is exceptional, both in terms of acting and reflecting thematically on the film itself. The ships multicultural crew helps to represent that this is a global crisis. American, British, Japanese, Oceanic and Chinese actors were employed to demonstrate this, with perfect casting all-around. Cillian Murphy offers a strong and charismatic performance (as expected), Hiroyuki Sanada brings a powerful nobility befitting of a leader, and Chris Evans offers a moral grayness rarely seen in other large sci-fi productions. The only significant issues I have with the casting and acting of the film is that Michelle Yeoh was pretty much wasted, and Mark Strong is given horrendous material. However this material only occurs during the films terrible climax, which I will cover at the end.The screenplay is, at first, very good also. Focusing on the effects of human error rather than convoluted villains and freak occurrences adds a reliability and tragedy to the events that are also often missing in certain sci-fi plots. The pacing is solid and allows for a good amount of character and atmosphere without seeming bloated or losing focus. Furthermore the dialogue seems natural, and fitting for a group of intelligent individuals (Physicists, Psychiatrists, Astronauts etc.). The screenplay dives during the climax also however, suffering worse than the other elements in fact. The soundtrack to the film is epic, defiantly one of the reasons the film starts off so strong. John Murphy tops his excellent work on the '28 Days Later' OST, bringing a sense of grandeur to the proceedings of the film. It truly is one of the great modern soundtracks.Now I will talk about the climax. The reason my rating is a 5 rather than the 7/8 the first two-thirds were worthy of. Without spoiling the film, the cerebral and intelligent tone set throughout the preceding film is totally dropped and a slasher-horror tone replaces it. I honestly didn't want to review this film as a horror, however that is what it becomes. It ends on a ridiculous and laughable note, ruining the majestic scientific concepts which propelled the film forward prior to the climax. In addition, it takes the previously promising scenes with Mark Strong, and ruins them, turning him into a campy slasher villain and robbing the film of its tragic overarching tone. Established by the villain-free human errors which occur at the start of the film.Overall, this film totally crashes and burns. It switches genre in the most ham-fisted manner possible, and spoils everything the film previously stood for. I would almost call it a betrayal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no reason this movie should have failed- great director, Boyle, great cast, Boyle co-wrote the script so it in a sense never left his hands which usually is a good thing. All the money was there needed to make a great movie- so what happened? It took over a year to write the script, which again should be a good thing, I mean time well spent to craft something quality is always desired from something like a script. Sadly, for the movie Sunshine, that time was wasted. Sunshine is a boring, downer movie. The premise of the movie: kick-starting the sun, which is a very big idea and capable of being full of wonder and mystery, is told from the smallest most menial perspective. Zero wonder zero mystery zero interest.</fullReview>

One or two, a maybe, but all of them? Did the Psychologist who evaluate this crew get their diploma off the back of a pop tart box? You can't connect with the characters at all and I couldn't have given a crap who died in the end. They were nothing more than stereotypes making every bad decision in the book to advance a weak plot.This isn't even bad science fiction. Bad science fiction is good in its own way.

		<fullReview>I make no excuses for Sunshine. I enjoy the hell out of watching it and it has some striking images that are hard to forget, even if a lot of visual cues are lifted from 2001. It's a gorgeous film. But there are some very ugly plot holes in Alex Garland's script. Capa is the most important human asset and he must remain safe and remain alive to deliver the payload. Yet, when a mathematical error sends the ship off course and damages some panels that shield the ship, Capa is volunteered by an angry Mace to risk his life closing the panels. A couple of scenes later, Mace is protecting Capa by giving him the only space suit. The film takes a narrative nosedive when it enters its last act, becoming a typical slash and stalk scenario in space. It's a very schizophrenic ending and Boyle shifts his filmmaking gears into overdrive with obnoxious flash editing and out of control camera work. Everything about the last act should have been junked. It's an insult to everything that preceded it. I really make no excuses for Sunshine, I love watching it and find it very rewarding up until the final act, but I'm not blind to the fact that the film is riddled with problems. I can't defend a film that shoots itself in the foot more than once, but for reasons I can't seem to figure out, I keep going back to the film on occasion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thought-Provoking and Hard-Hitting Look at Humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2057, the sun is dying and the planet is in jeopardy, and so a team of astronauts make a second attempt at a dangerous mission to revive the sun. Facing nothing but adversity along the way the team must overcome all the odds as they are humanity's last hope for survival.I still feel a little in shock at this film. It takes such an honest, hard-hitting look at humanity, placing the viewer straight into the difficult lives of the astronauts and constantly throwing a series of increasingly tough decisions and scenarios ? it makes you question every decision they make, and then question yourself. I've never thought more seriously about the idea of sacrifice for the greater good than whilst being put into the shoes of the characters. Don't be put off by this though ? it's thought-provoking only so long as you let it be. Knowing this was a Danny Boyle film I had high hopes for the directorial styling of this film and it lived up to my expectations. He manages to simultaneously create the feeling of confinement and eternal empty space, and throws in some really trippy snapshot scenes that give a terrifying edge of madness as the film progresses. Visually it is very convincing (and apparently also factually as the film's science adviser was Dr Brian Cox), in particular the CGI shots of the sun, which is interestingly portrayed both astronomically and more religiously, a nice nod to the Greek myth of Icarus (who flew too close to the sun), that lends its name to the space shuttle.The casting is pretty strong which is necessary to clash each of these flawed characters and drive their individual motivations on the mission. The most notable performances came from Cillian Murphy, the determined but hesitant hero; Chris Evans, the tough and hard-hitting voice of reason (a somewhat unfamiliar role to him but one that he carries off impeccably, as I usually find with his work); and Rose Byrne, the compassionate and slightly vulnerable one who offers a last-ditch attempt to prove that humanity isn't completely doomed to selfishness. However the performances from the other actors (Michelle Yeoh, Troy Garity, Hiroyuki Sanada, Benedict Wong and Cliff Curtis) all brought that little something different to each argument and scenario that made you think.Sunshine is a thought-provoking and hard-hitting look at humanity that will have you questioning yourself about how you would make decisions in a life or death situation to save a world that is not so unrealistic from what the future could be like. This one definitely stays with you long after it's over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film - Third act fell short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine is a visually stunning, suspenseful science fiction thriller, taking a turn for somewhat of a horror towards the end. But it takes a humanist approach to its subject. This dystopian future is set in 2057, where a team of international astronauts are sent on a dangerous mission to "re-ignite" the dying sun with a nuclear fission bomb on board a giant spacecraft called Icarus II. Very clever name, I must say, for those of you who don't get the pun please watch the film and then google the Greek myth of Icarus. But anyway, the sun has started unexpectedly to lose its power, throwing the Earth into a perpetual winter, compelling humanity to send a spacecraft (Icarus I) that carries a stellar bomb payload intended to re-ignite it. But the Icarus I was lost for reasons unknown, having failed in its mission. So Earth had to send a second spacecraft with a new payload, the Icarus II, in a final attempt, as the Earth has been exhausted of the materials necessary to make the bomb. The Icarus II must now strive not to end up with the same faith, making the crew humanity's last hope.The movie stars Cillian Murphy as Capa, an astronaut physicist charged with the mission of exploding a large, extremely powerful nuclear device into the sun to re-ignite it and save the Earth. However their plans go quite awry, as Icarus II nears the sun, the crew discovers a distress signal from another spacecraft? the Icarus I. Having been previously lost seven years ago, there is no way the crew could have survived, but even if the crew there are dead, the spacecraft is still armed with the same payload as the Icarus II and this may give the crew two chances to re-ignite the sun if the first was to fail. Captain Kaneda, played by Hiroyuki Sanada, lets Capa make the decision seeing as he is the only physicist on board and therefore knows more about the physics behind the bombs. Capa runs a simulation of the bomb's deployment and detonation, which like all previous runs is inconclusive due to the unpredictable variables inherent in the physics inside a gravity well. After a risk assessment, Capa decides the chances of the first attempt being successful are too slim to risk the faith of mankind, so they go for it. But as you'd suspect, things start to go wrong, setting the crew's nerves, as well as the viewer's, on edge.The special effects of Sunshine are amazing, the set design and editing are on the same superb level. The story is tense, exciting and gripping. Even though the revelation of what happened to the crew on the first spaceship is somewhat uninspired at best. There are not enough good things to be said about Danny Boyle, I think I've done nothing short of love every movie of his I've seen. From Slumdog Millionaire to Trainspotting, he truly has an impressive body of work. Even though the last act of the film took a giant turn in tone, becoming more of a horror/thriller, which I wouldn't have had that much of a problem with had the main antagonist not been really really far fetched and somewhat ruined my suspension of disbelief for what otherwise was an amazing film. But I blame Alex Garland for poor writing on that part.But the score in this film.. holy wow, it is insane how good it is. I saw some trivia for the film on IMDb mention that over ten other major blockbuster films borrowed the score, including the trailer for X-Men: Days of Future Past. But wow is it understandable, some of the shots and scenes coupled with this score is truly iconic, and will probably be imprinted in my mind as one of the top spots whenever I reflect on epic cinematic moments.Fun fact, Cillian Murphy said working on this film is what tipped him over from agnosticism to atheism.All things considered, I'd give this film a strong 8/10. Would've been 9/10 if it wasn't for that last weird act probably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of scientist out there with no imagination gave this movie bad reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is as good as it gets for a sci-fi thriller. I can't believe some of the reviews on here calling it bad science for a sci-fi movie because not every single detail of cellular synthesis in space was explained to them like in a college level physics lectures. USE YOUR IMAGINATIONS.Some people just can't accept that the sun, in this film's plot, is dying. I guess it's because so many astronomers out there have concluded, based on their research, that the sun won't die for another 5 billion years. But we're assuming scientist never make errors and that their data is always correct...that is until they observe new data that contradicts old data. That's the only flaw with the movie - is that it doesn't explain why the sun is dying. I guess if they could've made a 4 hour uncut version, where every single proposition is laid out for the people that have to nitpick every detail, who can't seem to grasp the artful mastery of story-telling, or appreciate gead CGI cinematography and miss the whole "thriller" aspect of the movie because they are busy trying to disprove it, then these people would have been satisfied. It was bad plot development in that regard on the writing to omit it, but I had no problem with it. I can use my IMAGINATION. A lot of people are mad about the whole oxygen levels of the space-ship, when if they were paying attention, in dialog, it is clearly stated that the ship is NOT filled with oxygen. People just assumed that it was, and that a crew of 4-6 people should not run out of oxygen anytime soon.Another point of contention was delivering the payload; and that there was only one physicist on board (Cillian Murphy's character) who was qualified to "flip the switch" to save earth. If they were paying attention, they should have known that the captain and the navigator were qualified, but were dead, so Cillian Murphy's character was the only one left to do, altho it was his responsibilities in the first place.The biggest dig I read from negative reviews is the psychological make up of the crew. Maybe real life astronauts don't have emotions or show signs of turmoil when faced with disaster, saving mankind, and just soldier through it like trained robots. But I'm thinking, all the socially inept nerds raving on IMDb about how calm and composed astronauts are, just can't comprehend the human condition or emphasize with human emotion in gritty situations bc they are OCD and antisocial- bots like the character Sheldon on the Big-Bang Theory TV show. Now that's probably a fact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politically correct astronaut team goes on a mission to regenerate the earth's dying sun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I come into my viewing of most modern movies without reading reviews or knowing anything about them. Then I let the movie unfold around me and wait for it to take me into another world."Sunshine" has a very good premise for a sci-fi movie. It drew me in. The sun is dying. A team of astronauts has been sent to regenerate it by implanting an atomic payload that will restart the sun's fusion by supplying a new basis for it. The physics of this is implausible but since it comes early in the story, it can be forgiven. Also, why not simply send the payload by itself and control its going off by radio waves? Maybe the sun interferes.Anyway, it's the second mission, aptly or not so optimistically called Icarus II. Icarus I failed. Icarus in the Greek legend had wings, flew too close to the sun and perished.The sun's light holds a strange and mystical attraction as crafts near it. People seem to develop a desire to merge with it, like a God. This adds a horror element to the story as it develops. There is no alien in the film, but a back door alien comes into it by this means.Especially toward the end and sometimes as the story unfolds, the film makers attempt a kind of poetry of light and image. This is a poetry that attempts to maintain the forward momentum of the story while telling it with fuzzy, jumbled, distorted images of light and activity that lift the experience beyond Kubrick's measured and slow visualizations into an action-oriented near abstract composition of light, faces, eyes, movement. It's real images mixed with abstraction, always with very quick editing and sometimes a jittery camera.This takes what is a pretty ordinary sequence of confrontation between protagonist trying to complete the mission and antagonist trying to stop the mission and lifts it out of the ordinary. It's a nice try. I think it will satisfy some in the audience. I felt it was too confusing and didn't really succeed. It made the abstract process become the focus, and that took away from the story. It couldn't transform a mundane story by excitement. It instead needed more wonder, but without the sentimentality that crept in at the very end.The faults of this movie are many, unfortunately, counterbalanced by the production design. The astronauts do not look the part. Some look scruffy. They act like children at times, lacking maturity, which is the fault of the script in failing to develop the situations in such a way that they could apply the intelligence that they should have. Some of the actors lack a screen presence, and, in any event, the script struggles with developing the characters of 8 different people. Some are killed off, which is pretty standard for stories like this and not all that creative. At some really critical sequences of action, it is impossible for viewers to see and understand what's going on. The direction simply does not show us. The camera work is too jittery at times.The net result of script issues, acting issues, directing issues, film editing issues and cinematography issues is to reduce the illusion of reality of what we are seeing. We notice the problems and we fail to be engulfed in the story as we should. Excitement, movement and light cannot substitute for the creation of character, rising tension and intelligent people. "Forbidden Planet" is many times more watchable than "Sunshine". My involvement goes down when I cannot tell what is going on. I do not understand why viewers are left out of the circuit when you are trying to tell a story. Novels do not do this. What I consider good movies use the camera and script to make sure we are seeing a large amount of the created world. Why does a movie like this spend all that money for special effects and then fail to follow through in creating a movie world that we can follow and with characters that are not immature?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunshine, like other Science Fiction movies, deal with an outer space menace that might cause the end of humankind. Fortunately, differently from other movies, the threat is not the well-known story of an asteroid about to crash with the Earth. In this movie, is the Sun that needs to be reignited to save life on Earth. Obviously, we have the classic expendable crew (or at least they always become expendable in Sci-Fi movies) that volunteered to fulfill the mission. The movie pretty much take us in this journey and shows us how each of their personalities react when they are pushed to the limit because of the circumstances.What I liked:They pay homage to several classic movies of the field.I really liked when the answer to Let's split up was: "it's not a good idea, we might get picked up one at a time by aliens".Every member of the crew seemed totally believable in their scientist role. No silly lines or far-fetched theories. The visuals. Specially when they showed you Mercury and how small it looks compared to the Sun. That the name of ship was Icarus. With that name the mission was obviously going to fail.Cassie's (Rose Byrne) performance, and how she keeps a cool head until the circumstances force her to do the opposite.What I didn't like: The ending. Not the ending per se, but as a lot of people have already pointed out, the final third of the movie seems a bit confusing. Specially after Pinbacker showed up. The blurry effects on Pinbacker scenes. It was just confusing.Without being my favorite Sci-Fi movie I liked more things that the ones I disliked. Score (7)</fullReview>

What Danny Boyle has achieved on such a small budget compared to his Holllywood rivals is phenomenal. The viewing room and images of the sun are breathtaking. The film is has all the makings of a great sci-fi, atmosphere, tension, desperation, claustrophobia and conflict. I won't spoil the film but I wish they film makers had voted to continue to mission as planned and not make the diversion the characters opted for.This is a great film, this could have been so much more. Danny Boyle never seems to talk about this much when I see him interviewed. I wonder why this is. He has actually achieved a near fantastic sci-fi film and think it warrants more recognition than it originally got. The film has so much more to offer than its beautiful special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is one positive thing about Sunshine, it's the quality of the cinematography: it is well shot and the special effects are quite good.Because, when considering the rest, it is way off the mark. The premise didn't augur anything good, and it is confirmed with a scenario full of heavy clichés, whether it is the stereotyped dialogues, characters or situations. Moreover, a lot of elements are a bit far-fetched, some decisions are hard to assimilate. But the most ridiculous and incomprehensible point is Pinbacker, the superman you never get to see clearly, who is absurd and absolutely irrelevant to the story.The movie becomes quite painful to watch after barely 45 minutes, and one's only wish is for it to end, but unfortunately the second part is very long and a real torture to finish.That goes to show that Danny Boyle, besides his great successes, also directed a flew flops like Sunshine, Millions or A Life Less Ordinary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very solid Sci-fi thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never really ever heard anything about this movie, usually that spells disaster, but this time it was great!"Sunshine" is the story of a group of astronauts sent to the now dying sun with a nuclear payload that earth hopes will awaken and rebirth its power to save mankind. This is a second mission as the first was sent 7 years prior without any word from it since. When the crew finds the signal from the ill-fated mission they make a choice, and that choice may cost all of them their lives, or worse, the lives of all of human kind altogether.The cast was superb. If you look at the list they are all pretty good actors, but most of them were not big stars (or at least, leading stars). Today they are all pretty accomplished but I am sure I missed this one because of their 2007 status (I am writing this in 2012). Everyone did a great job, Cillian Murphy was superb, and I think Chris Evans did wonderful as well, especially after seeing him in those bad "Fantastic Four" movies.I have read a few reviews that were kind of unkind as far as the scientific aspects, physics, and feasibility, etc, aspects of the movie. I am no rocket scientist or nuclear physicist, so none of that really bothered me, and what I don't know only helps me enjoy this movie. I think the overall feel of the movie is very well done. It gives you the sort of no contact, alone in space feel that makes for a good atmosphere, no pun intended. It goes a long way in bringing one the sense of fear, doom, and isolation of space and makes the viewer understand a bit why many psychologists have suggested that if some people were to spend a lot of time in space they would develop a kind of dementia from it. I also think the actors did a decent job of portraying such a crucial mission, and the reality that it just may be a suicide mission and their lives are less important to the mission itself.There are a few parts of the movie that seem to be a standard of the genre, borrowed, and overused, but overall this movie does a good job of being somewhat original. They're were a couple of little technical issues that I kind of questioned and left me scratching my head, but in the end it didn't bother me a bit and left me pretty happy to give it a thumbs up with an 8 out of 10. So pick it up and enjoy it. It might be good for a sci-fi night and would stand up pretty well with other movies like "2001: A space Odyssey" (although a much deeper movie)or "Prometheus."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunshine - Not as Bright as I had hoped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** out of **** Sunshine is a film about a crew of 8 voyaging out to he dying sun to help restart it. It is Earth's second attempt. The first one failed 7 years prior. Though a sci-fi film, it plays more like a psychological thriller as the film is more about this crew of 8 coping with being alone together for so long and possibly never returning to Earth.Written by Alex Garland (28 Days Later, 28 Weeks Later) and Directed Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, A life Less Ordinary) the film does succeed in what it's trying to say even though sometimes it seems as though they want to do more. The actors are all above average in their parts, most notably Cillian Murphey. Even the special effects were decent for a film probably made for little money.Basically, this was just a film I could not get into. It lost me mid way, not because I couldn't follow along but because I didn't want to follow along anymore. I was more interested in a film about loneliness and man vs mankind then what we got in the second half when the film changes directions a little bit.Eventually, the crew gets a signal from the lost ship of the first attempt to restart the sun and the crew decides to investigate, going off their projected track towards the sun. Of course, curiosity will harm this crew and they will realize that they should have just kept going. When this happens, I kind of lost interest and never really regained it.Try it out as I am only one of a few that did not really get into this film. Most like and you will probably like it to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ain't no sunshine when she's gone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's very hot these days with temperature only rising and, considering I can't stand that kind of heat very well, I'm getting an urge to shoot down the sun. It happens to me every summer. What I don't think of in moments like that, are repercussions of such an act. Without sun, every form of life on this planet would cease to exist. So if the sun was to die, what would you be willing to do to prevent it from happening? That's one of the questions director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland ask in their 2007 sci-fi movie called ?Sunshine".In the movie, the sun is dying, and the only way to save it is to deliver a massive bomb to its surface, activate it and sort of reignite the sun that way. The movie opens with spaceship Icarus II on its way to carry out that mission. As you can assume, there was Icarus I before that, which didn't succeed. The crew of Icarus II consists of eight people, mostly scientists, who are all convinced the mission will go well and they'll come back to Earth, or at least want to be, until things start to go wrong. It's an excellent study of human character under pressure, feelings of guilt (individual and collective) and coping with responsibility. And it doesn't just observe human reactions but also makes you question ideas of guilt, responsibility, dedication and bravery themselves. There are some ethical dilemmas present too. As well as the questioning of today almost universally accepted way of deciding (democracy) in extreme situations. As if that weren't enough the movie also tackles the question of faith. More precisely, faith in God. Information I found out reading on various Internet sites reveals that subject of faith was even more emphasized in Garland's screenplay but Boyle decided to tone it down in the movie. There is one more very interesting thing. Somewhat similar to ?Prometheus", which speaks of human fascination with the ones who created us, ?Sunshine" speaks of human fascination with the thing that keeps us alive. Many ancient civilizations worshiped the sun as a deity, but as the world slowly developed to what it is today, human fascination with the sun faded. Scientific explanations demystified it and, in our ever-increasing ignorance, we started taking it for granted. But for some the fascination still remains. As we can see from Kaneda's and Searle's death. Both of them sacrificed for the sake of the mission, but you can sense they wanted to go down in that particular way.It's not just all the things this movie deals with. What makes it great is how it deals with them. The characters are greatly written and superbly acted. You can feel all the fears, doubts and wishes even before you see them show. Visual effects and cinematography are great, as well as the haunting soundtrack. The screenplay is brilliantly simple yet incredibly effective. And on top of all, Boyle manages to turn it from sci-fi to horror halfway through without the characters, or the story, losing their credibility. In fact, you get even more immersed. While in the beginning it engages you intellectually, as the movie progresses you become more and more emotionally involved.It's often the case in movies that one hero, with nothing to lose but his own life, is willing to do whatever it takes for the sake of others. Unlike that, here we have a group of ordinary people with much to lose but nevertheless putting the mission ahead of themselves. And it's worth telling it is done in a very realistic way, devoid of all melodramatic scenes usually present in stories like this one (ok, maybe there's one). In contrast, some of the scenes here are truly profoundly disturbing and emotional, poetic even, but to write more about them would do them no justice. You just have to see them for yourself. The crew of Icarus II was mesmerized by sunshine, and so will be you.http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent science fiction drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scientifically this movie doesn't really hold water. The premise is a bit far-fetched, the origin of the problem is never properly explained and the solution to that problem is shoddy at best. But, the point of science fiction is not always to be as scientifically accurate as possible. It is true that science fiction often predicts and even inspires inventions-yet-to-come, but equally as often its point is to ask the question: "What if?" What if a group of specialists were put into a ship that was the sole hope of humanity and they were forced to both co-exist under the pressure and to make hard, at times immoral, decisions? What would happen? And that's this movie and it is quite a thing to witness.The special effects, the style and the visuals are all first class, to begin with. I truly admire this movie's portrayal of the Sun. Every time it's on the screen it inspires awe and at times even religious fear. Even mere percentages of its full might are capable of seriously harming the passengers of the ship and its full power incinerates them instantly. That mere presence reminds me why so many civilizations have chosen to worship the Sun as their god. Furthermore, the space scenery and the ship itself look very nice and realistic, and the design of the ship incorporates many space traveling theories and solutions that were popular at the time of this movie's making and still are. Attention to the detail all around, very nice.I was also pleased to find that all of the actors were well-chosen for their roles and that they all give credible performances with special mentions going to Hiroyuki Sanada (Captain) and Chris Evans (Mace).The movie has some faults, though. I really didn't like the genre change towards the end of the movie. The drama and slowly building psychological tension of the first half were fine in my opinion and the sudden turn into a slasher film was unneeded in my opinion. It took away from the atmosphere and thus did the movie no favors. Still, it didn't ruin the movie, per se, just made it less great. So, with that in mind, I can safely say that I can recommend this one to all fans of science fiction and to all those that like intelligent films with believable characters, high stages and lots of atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't stand to see anybody hate on this movie. It was very entertaining and very suspenseful. I love Cilian Murphy, I think he is a great actor. I thought Chris Evans fit in nicely, he was the uncontrollable anger. Besides Rose Byrne, there are no real big names. I thought the movie did good with what they had. The plot is the sun is dying and must have life back. The main characters are the second engineer team that has been sent out to the sun to set a nuclear bomb in it to give its life back. The first engineer team got lost and know one knows what happened to them. The movie was suspenseful because it had so few characters but a big area to fill up. However the movie in my opinion didn't start as a suspense. The genre transitioned into it. And Danny Boyle's unique style fit in the movie well. I think he is a phenomenal directer. I believe that is movie is a 9 because for a movie that dose not seem to be better that a block buster hit, is in my mind better than a few block buster hits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunshine (2007) - The Sun in this Movie Really Hurts My Eyes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by the brilliant mind of Danny Boyle, "Sunshine" is a psychological science-fiction thriller that all revolves around sunlight. The film is set in the year 2057, and the Earth is in peril from the dying Sun. So, the crew of a spacecraft is sent on a dangerous mission to reignite the Sun with a stellar bomb. When starting as your typical science-fiction thriller, it later turns into a psychological horror film, when something enters the ship, and the Sun has to be saved quickly, before the intruder ruins everything. Well, this really was a great movie, and it's one of Danny Boyle's best flicks. This movie is surprisingly entertaining, with little amount of mishaps. For example, the powerful cast ensemble of Cillian Murphy, Chris Evans, Rose Byrne, Michelle Yeoh, and Mark Strong all provided unique and powerful performances, and it was really nice to see their faces on screen. But neither one of them has any sign of character development, because throughout, we have no idea who these people are, and we don't know their particular back-story. Also, although you're only stuck in one space throughout the two hours, the cool art direction of the spacecraft, and the visual effects of the sunshine itself help make the movie worth watching, and it is pretty stellar to watch on screen. This movie also has nice messages of saving the Sun, and showing the respect it needs. But sometimes, the movie felt lacking when there were some scenes that were too careless and hard to concentrate to, and I was kind of tired at those moments. But out of all that, "Sunshine" is still a pretty entertaining film, and it deserves all the recognition it needs from the well-acting, perfect special effects, and an incredible directing duty by Danny Boyle. "Sunshine", in my review, "a cool science fiction concept, a thrilling fun time".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goose bumps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Please excuse my English.-Some people, without having to watch sci-fi films, sometimes make up a 3d display of our solar system and try to comprehend how small we are, how helpless and unimportant. People nowadays feel anxiety, pressure and sometimes show inability to function well even when facing and/or trying to resolve simple matters. They still believe in religions and still fear of death. Even scientists. We act in a combination of logical thinking and sentiment.A few humans are sent to save the world by delivering a nuke on our dying sun. They spend the whole 16 months they've traveled thinking about the last crew, which had failed under unknown circumstances. About the fact that even if they deliver the payload it might not work after all and that even if it does work, they might not make it back... How is not the sun like a god to us in a way that we are like a god to an ant? When you approach something so powerful, it makes sense to feel awe, admiration, fear. They are working under very hard psychological conditions,some get crazy and some take bad decisions. The power these two captains and their crews knew they had is insane. Like owning earths self-destruct button.The film offers great acting, CGI, suspense, a perfect sound track and a simple but very effective script. The only part I didn't like was when Trey did that mistake... There was no logic in doing something in full manual mode, a semi-automatic mode makes much more sense, some computer fail safe protocols, that would help a human brain not forget something as important as what he did.Both Kaneda and Capa took heroic decisions which they knew would lead to their own deaths. And any hero deserves a glorious death accompanied by John Murphy's Adagio In D Minor :) How can someone not get goose bumps at least during those two scenes?Do we deserve to be saved? If yes, can a good man kill another for the greater good? Can everyone be a hero? Cant someone break and want to avenge the human race? Why change the inevitable, why not accept our death both as a person and as a race. Isn't it coming anyway?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunshine is a strikingly beautiful film.The plot revolves around a ship, the second to be given this mission, sent to restart a failing sun.It is difficult to talk about the plot of the film without needing to talk about the final third of the film. It doesn't quite work. It doesn't work for many reasons and not least because of the unexplained questions it throws up. A compromise perhaps.That is not to say it is badly written, the characters are believable and acted by an brilliantly chosen cast, no weak links here but it felt like the film had to restart itself after sixty minutes like the film began to run out of steam like the sun itself.It isn't, however, a bad film. One of the plot points of the film is the relationship between the crew of both ships and the sun. The sun seems to hold some hypnotic power over them and in fact does the same for the viewer. It is here where an otherwise interesting idea of a script is elevated to something quite visually stunning, it is here where the film becomes worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Welcome to the Icarus Two"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Sunshine (2007)' could comfortably be described as 'Alien (1979)' meets 'Event Horizon (1997)' {and, make no mistake, the latter is intended as a complement ? Anderson's film scared the heck out of me when I was younger}. In the mid-21st century, eight improbably-young astronauts leave a frozen Earth on the Icarus II, their mission to reignite the dying Sun with a nuclear bomb the size of Manhattan. Directed by Danny Boyle (whose previous film '28 Days Later (2002)' was well-made but unappealing), this excellent sci-fi is extremely rich in atmosphere, even if the mood is squandered somewhat by a final act that veers towards conventional slasher horror. As 'Sunshine' nears its climax, it feels as though Boyle's camera is deliberately denying us a decent glimpse of the resident villain, whose function in the film is more akin to Jason Vorhees than any better-developed science-fiction villain.Most intriguing about the film, I thought, was how Boyle depicted sunlight in a way I'd never seen before: not merely as a means of illumination, but as a literal wave of matter and energy. It really brought home the incredible, incalculable intensity of the Sun, an idea that's lost when we gaze up into the sky from eight light-minutes away. The film also throws around a few religious ideas, equating the Sun (a giver of life) to God, but it's awkwardly handled. The sun-charred character of Pinpacker (Mark Strong) is given an introduction worthy of a saint/demon, bathed in a fierce white light that cleverly blinds the viewer to his features, but Boyle then uses the character too literally, as an invincible mad-man intent on sabotaging the mission, and not as a more abstract manifestation of the crew's deeply-entrenched conflicts of science and religion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually stunning, great music! Acting overall is good and convincing. You really get a feeling of loneliness. One of the best SCI-FI around. A bit sad maybe Boyle went Event-Horizon on us in the end but it does add to the thrill of time and space dimentia. One of the biggest problems of long space travels is astronauts going crazy. NASA is researching this. I watched the extra's with a NASA expert. Lots of the science is correct. Even now spaceships can already handle the immense heat from distances very close to the sun, past Mercury. In fact, the slingshot around Mercury was one of the few things that would not be possible in real life, or not in the way it gets done in the movie. I think Mercury is to small to slingshot at high speeds. So the science plays an important role and is nice to think about and see it unfold on screen.I loved it! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is almost what sci fi is all about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Boyle has created a beautiful sci fi flick that will be remembered as a genre redefining study of sanity, beauty and courage.Set in the near future Sunshine explores humans in a desperate struggle to save the earth by kick starting the sun with a whole lot of fuel. The characters are understandably pushed to breaking point and beyond as the weight of responsibility causes the pressure to boil over.Sensational acting, scripting, casting and the most beautiful score ever heard in sci fi, which will leave you breathless. Seriously the score deserved an Oscar. And you could almost add an Oscar for best supporting actor/actress to .... the sun! So well portrayed as benevolent and violent, both giving and taking away life - it's scary. I almost have dreams of falling into the sun now... the cast portray the situation with such visceral emotion you can almost taste their feelings. That of responsibility to save life on earth above all else, but mixed with stress and feelings of doom and failure.Though the movie does fail at one point. Somewhere, someone decided that it would be much better if it devolved from a sci fi epic into a hack and slash gore fest with all the unlikeliness that accompanies such "films". That someone should be shot. I bet Danny was the guy from Return of the Jedi saying "stay ooonnn target... stay onnn target..." and then got shot down. It almost redeems itself through the efforts of all involved, but unfortunately you are left with a sour taste in your mouth of what could have been sci fi perfection. Come on Danny, make a directors cut!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie about My Favourite Star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite some flaws I judge this movie by asking the question, "Am I glad I watched it?" The Answer is a resounding "Yes!"Let's look at what's right with this movie: The actors. They're proof that you don't need a well-known cast to deliver a powerful performance. Having a Captain Russel Crowe and Chief Scientist Tom Cruise would have sucked the stark reality out of it. Ebert says it best: "They almost all play professional astronaut/scientists, and not action-movie heroes." Frankly I think this a better movie for it and I hope we see more movies cast like this. It lends the movie a realistic feel we seldom see in space movies. Now combine those performances with brilliant visuals, the cinematography, beautiful lighting, sets, art design, CGI, and ambient solar music and the result is a powerful (for want of a better word) atmosphere.So where does the movie go wrong? Cillian Murphy is miscast as the mission's physicist. For a supposedly smart guy, he doesn't demonstrate much brilliance by repeatedly making really bad decisions, has a temper, is a bit of a jerk, and basically carries on like an angsty teen. Murphy is not a bad actor by any means, but his character just doesn't fit the movie. He is somewhat balanced by the other actors - particularly Chris Evans' - and perhaps this was Director Danny Boyle's thinking; it created conflict and allows the script to vocalize the arguments. But in the end, it was Murphy's character was the one who was always wrong, and never demonstrated any remorse for his repeated stupidity. In the end I hated him for getting everyone killed.The last third of the movie degenerates into a slasher. There were undertones that staring into the Sun that close could do strange things to a man; The psychologists last words to the ever so calm but doomed Captain Kaneda is "What do you see?" So when Icarus II finds the derelict Icarus I, there are all sorts of possibilities from the paranormal to the fantastic. Instead we get Freddy Krueger in Raybans, as if the technical challenges of lobbing a bomb into the sun wasn't enough to keep the audience interested. Oh yeah. And Cillian Murphy's character on discovering the stowaway killer doesn't tell anyone else in the crew but runs to meet him with a dumb smile.The remaining flaws are niggling mistakes. Every kid knows, if you're going onto a derelict spaceship, do it wearing a full spacesuit for obvious reasons. The lack of redundancy in the crew: Supposedly Murphy's character is the only one who knows how to operate the bomb. What if he didn't survive deep sleep, had a heart attack or got swept off the ship when he was outside doing repairs? Why send him outside anyway? There's an ongoing subplot about them running out of oxygen, yet the Icarus is a very big ship. Take it from someone who slept in a sealed car; they had plenty of oxygen. Why are there so few spacesuits on this ship, and why don't they give poor Chris Evans a thermal suit so he can fix the ship's coolant? He has to keep climbing in and sure enough eventually freezes to death. The airlock-to-airlock scene is just a bit too reminiscent of 2001. There's also some sloppy editing; they arrived at the Icarus I so fast I didn't even realize they were already there. I just hope when they build an Icarus III they'll remember to give them oxygen reserves, or at least not to lump critical systems like oxygen garden all in one place. And please screen your astronauts for personality disorders and god complexes, especially your psychologist. Also the occasional injection of grunge music into the soundtrack screws up an otherwise great score.Some critics have attacked the movie for bad science; the whole notion of restarting our dying sun with a fissile bomb. But I really have to wonder, how many of these critics could give a coherent explanation of the physics as to exactly why this won't work? And how many are just pretending? Others have criticized dooming the ship by naming it, of all things, "Icarus." But as Boyle pointed out, giving it an American name like "Hope" or "Spirit of Triumph" would have given the audience the wrong vibe. The best thing about this movie? God doesn't make his usual cameo.Others have criticized that Benedict Wong's navigator could make a mistake that exposes the ship to danger. As someone who works with computers, I can tell you when you're dealing with complex systems with thousands of equations and moving parts it's very easy to overlook something. Large companies actually hold 'Change Control' meetings where they talk though what might go wrong in any change and how they'd deal with it. I thought Wong's mistake (he's certainly apologetic for it) was a nice touch of realism, but I will grant you he shouldn't have made those changes all by himself. And this is where "Sunshine" runs into trouble; If you're going to be a 'realistic' space movie, be sure to dot your i's and cross your t's. The audience will spot it if you don't.A third of the way into this movie I thought I was watching something very special. Then they kept making mistake after mistake and when Freddy Krueger arrived I knew the gig was in. But I'm willing to overlook this because I really enjoyed that first third. "Sunshine" shows the promise of an untapped genre in realistic space movies. Boyle said he won't do Science Fiction again. That's a shame, but I hope some other director picks up the genre and takes it forward.A bit of script and story editing, and this movie could have been a classic. If you're a science geek, keep your expectations in check and you will enjoy "Sunshine".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A derivative but impressive space epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fox Searchlight logo is played backwards before leading us into the ill-fated mission of Iscarus II and it's mission to reignite the dying sun which has has cast the Earth into a solar winter. It's deliberately disorientating moment in this British-made science fiction epic, which is characterised by some top-notch special effects. The look of the sun - especially it's flaming surface - predominate the film. The story follows an American space mission heads towards the dying sun to detonate a nuclear payload (the size of Manhatten). Inevitably, there's a distress call from the previous - and thought lost - mission which leads to disaster. The interest in these films is guessing which crew member will perish next, and, sure enough, one by one they are frozen in the minus 200 degrees temperature of space, burned to a crisp by the sun, murdered, frozen by coolant fluid, or commit suicide - leaving Cillian Murphy's sole survivor plummeting into the sun and detonating the city-sized bomb just in the nick of time at the film's frenetic climax. The film has great visual strengths and there's no denying that Danny Boyle is an English filmmaker par excellence. Much as I enjoyed the film, it is prevented from classic status because - in the end - it feels so derivative: it reminds you of 2001, it's underrated sequel 2010, Alien, Solaris and Event Horizon. Maybe that was the intention - a giant homage to the science fiction of Boyle's youth.The true star is Mick Tildsley's breathtaking production design - from the cramped modern interiors of Icarus II to the dark, gloomy, dust-filled and abandoned Iscarus I circling Mercury, to the splendid inside of the nuclear payload which resembles a massive warehouse. And it is a lot more fun to sit through than 2001.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sharp Psychological Space Odyssey Thriller Dampened by a Desperate Final Stretch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly not to be confused with "Little Miss Sunshine", the title of this psychologically driven 2007 sci-fi thriller is about the only thing coy about director Danny Boyle's latest entry to his diverse resume of films, which includes "Transpotting", "Millions", and the film this one most resembles, "28 Days Later". The same high-octane brio is evident here, which is no coincidence since the film shares the same screenwriter, Alex Garland. However, the setting is fifty years in the future on the Icarus II, a spaceship voyaging toward the sun in order for the eight-person crew to save it from extinguishing. The sun has apparently been infected by a concentrated energy nucleus leftover from the Big Bang, a "Q-ball" which has disrupted normal matter and made destroying the nucleus the only option to ensure mankind's survival. That's why the ship is carrying a nuclear device the size of Manhattan in order to reignite the sun.Even though it echoes stronger films of the genre like "Alien", "Solaris" and even "2001: A Space Odyssey", the film's first two-thirds are genuinely suspenseful, but the last part turns an unfortunate corner into a pandering level of terror. The psychological aspects of the plot are the most intriguing with the crew extremely fatigued and stressed having been in the ship together for sixteen months. Things start to unravel almost immediately when a radio signal is heard from what turns out to be the first Icarus, a ship that made the attempt to detonate the device seven years earlier. A decision needs to be made as to whether the Icarus II should reroute to save what remains of its predecessor, whether it be survivors or the added insurance of another nuclear payload. From that point forward, Boyle and Garland set up the crew to face crisis after crisis each serving to thwart some part of their mission, and it all begins with human error. It's refreshing to see a sci-fi film devote a lot of time to the psyche of the individual characters and broader philosophical concerns about morality because the approach helps make their ultimate fates resonate more.The requisite multi-ethnic cast has been assembled to play the crew. Hiroyuki Sanada ("The White Countess") stoically plays Captain Kaneda, the Zen-samurai leader. On the other side of the emotional spectrum are a too-young Chris Evans ("The Nanny Diaries"), who plays Mace, the hot-headed second-in-command, and Troy Garity as Harvey, the less-than-heroic communications specialist. The latter is involved in a scene inspired by a similarly harrowing scene in "Marooned". Even though her usual vibrancy is somewhat neutered, Michelle Yeoh ("Memoirs of a Geisha") is a welcome presence as Corazon, the biologist in charge of the self-contained garden. Rose Byrne plays the pilot Cassie as the futile catalyst of humanism on the ship, while Cliff Curtis highlights the unhealthy obsession that medical officer Searle has developed for the sun. The focal point, however, is Capa, the physicist in charge of monitoring the payload, and for a nice change of pace, Cillian Murphy ("28 Days Later", "The Wind That Shakes the Barley") gets to play a relatively normal character and unlikely hero.Mandatory for this genre of cinema, production values are top-notch with excellent work from cinematographer Alwin Kuchler, production designer Mark Tildesley and with her retro-Jules Verne-style gold spacesuits, costume designer Suttirat Anne Larlarb. The CGI work is especially strong with a fearsome depth given to the interior scenes and a scarifying power to the close-up shots of the sun. Extras with the 2008 DVD are plentiful starting with two separate commentary tracks ? the first has Boyle engaging with his unique insights into the production, while the second features the film's scientific consultant, Dr. Brian Cox of the University of Manchester, speaking Carl Sagan-like about the possibility of such an occurrence when he's not giving his take on the action. It would have been more digestible for the viewer to combine Boyle and Cox's comments into one track. There are twenty minutes of deleted and extended scenes best experienced with Boyle's comments, as well as an interesting multi-chapter video production diary by the cast and crew that runs about 47 minutes in total. Boyle has also generously included two creative shorts, both running less than six minutes, by budding filmmakers, and the original trailer and previews round out the extras.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. Ever since I saw the trailer, I became intrigued as to what this movie would be like. I think Sunshine is so good because, to me, it's not a typical Sci-Fi/Futuristic movie. I definitely saw a lot of deeper meaning and symbolism in the story itself, and in the characters. While I feel the movie doesn't focus so much on the audience getting attached to the characters, it does reveal throughout the movie certain aspects of the characters, which in turn is interesting and touching. I think the fact that the movie centered around the sun also brought an original touch to the film. The visuals in the film were absolutely stunning. Besides Star Wars, I think that was one of the only Sci-Fi spaceship movies in which I actually felt like I was part of the crew. It's a very beautiful movie and I would highly recommend seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a disaster movie with substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know how many times I've seen a big Hollywood blockbuster, and ended up disappointed. From the ridiculousness of Armageddon to the "aliens are going to destroy all mankind" b.s. of Independence Day to the outright terrible The Day After Tomorrow, we finally get a movie that is actually worth the time and effort, let alone money! And this one cost significantly less to make than all those others. The visual effects were brilliant, but even the storyline was pretty decent. The characters interact realistically which is also a major achievement considering most of the other movies in this genre. My hat goes off to Danny Boyle for successfully creating a movie where I actually cared if the Earth would be destroyed or not. The only reason that this movie didn't get a 9 or 10 from me was the brief lapse towards the end where it tried to be a horror movie. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see the movie. Even so, it wasn't done poorly, it just didn't fit with the intensity of the rest of the movie. Anyways, this is a highly entertaining movie filled with characters that you actually give a damn about and outstanding visual effects. I highly recommend this movie to any fans of sci-fi, or just good movies in general. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting effect having the entire movie set in space--it does well to emphasize the vacuousness of our planet. Depictions of the desperation of life on earth, however, may have conjured greater awareness and empathy amongst the audience. As a graduate of Astronomy, I have a keen interest in both observing and teaching the complexities of our Universe. Thus, I took the greatest issue with Sunshine's scientific inaccuracies: namely the device used to 're-ignite' the sun (as many billions would be required to accomplish such a task). Of course, I realize that movies (especially science fiction) are designed to convey a quick and impressive punch line and would risk losing audience interest if too burdened by indecipherable science. Nonetheless, they should realize that a fair portion of their audience ( especially critics) will undoubtedly pick up on those inaccuracies, and the films affect may be lost (to some). Overall Sunshine is a unique variation to the modern day " global catastrophe" film (depicting it from an external perspective), and I would recommend it for any science fiction fan.</fullReview>

The Cinematography, and 'realism'. now, I did not say REALISTIC. this movie in a lot of parts is painfully far from accurate screen physics, and that truly bugs me. (I hated zombie movies, and still do, but "28 Days Later" was a wonderful brilliant film.) Boyle over-used the 'shaky' filming in this one. but other than that, the effects and cinematography was brilliant. the props were mild, and mildly inaccurate. I liked the characters, the introductory 'letter home' was a good basis for the limited character development of the film.another thing, people comparing this to "the core", have a short sited view of science fiction and horror, and are obviously slaves to the Hollywood culture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many comments point out that the movie starts off great, then it becomes worse and worse as soon as the Icarus II approaches the Icarus I. I agree with that, but still let's look at what's left.First of all, the characters are deep. Each one of them has a noble and a weak side, each one of them acts instinctively enough to look real and not just an artificial stereotype.Second, the visuals. The special effects really transmit the sense of the huge, gigantic, powerful, fascinating and yet terrible presence of the sun.Third, the plot development. Nothing gets straight from point A to point B, also thanks to the depth of the characters. And this doesn't mean that there's a master plan, it goes wrong, so let's switch to plan B, and it works. The whole movie is a sequence of good plans going wrong, of hope and despair, and it keeps u glued to your seat until the end.Maybe all these good points make the third part of the movie worse than it really is. You think you're watching something different, and then u get into a clone of Event Horizon.But still, thinking again, we can see Pinbacker's role as the dark, irrational side of the movie, as we can see the dark, irrational side of every character. Even visually, the blurring effects tell us that he's in the movie but at the same time he isn't...All in all, I think the whole movie can be seen as a struggle between light and darkness - in the visuals, in the characters, and in the plot. It has his flaws of course - but maybe they are part of this struggle?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The visuals in Sunshine befit the subject...or the 800lb gorilla in the "room". It is beautifully photographed. And the acting is tight throughout. All in all, this is another of your pretty good sci-fi trips that are as much inward journeys as they are outward adventures. But the film doesn't quite come down firmly enough on either side of the physical/metaphysical fence and suffers for it. Think the best of 2010: The Year We Make Contact diluted by the worst of Solaris.Alex Garland wrote a script that is mostly a nuts and bolts, action-driven, get-us-there-by-hook-or-crook affair. This isn't a bad thing necessarily, as the action pretty much fleshes out the deeper implications of the movie. But what did take the whole thing down a notch was the final overt attempt at going "deep". By forcing the metaphysical issue on us without warning or reason the film's finale seems almost histrionic as opposed to transcendent when it comes. In any case, Sunshine's not a bad take. And the space suits are very cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. You make me happy even when days are grey. Sunshine gives hope.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine is a British science fiction adventure thriller film directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland. It's a great psychologically minded film that dealt with strong spiritually themes about who we are and the idea of hope VS Dogma thinking. It also have great use of science to the point, it can be a bit realistic. It even took advice from famous physicist Brian Cox. It could happen. The sun is not dying in the normal way, but in the Cox scenario, the sun has instead been 'infected' with a 'Q-ball' -- a supersymetric nucleus, left over from the Big Bang that is disrupting the normal matter. The film's bomb is meant to blast the Q-ball to its constituent parts, which will then naturally decay, allowing the sun to return to normal. I'll buy that. Blasting a Q-ball to its constituent parts sounds normal to me. Still, I doubt the sun will die anytime soon. It probably get hotter than colder in real life. The film is set in 2057, where the crew of the Icarus II must find a way to save Earth from the peril of a dying Sun, by reignite the star with a nuclear bomb with the mass of Manhattan. The risk are great as it's the final attempt to save mankind, as the previous first mission, the Icarus I, was lost seven years previously for reasons unknown. The movie has this, Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, Tarkovsky's 1972 film Solaris, and the 1979 science-fiction horror film Alien feel to it. The space crew in the film also consisted of American/Asian nationality because of the filmmakers' belief that the American and Chinese space programs would be the most developed and economically empowered 50 years in the future. I do like seeing Asians actors in a main stream film. While the crew is made out of some mediocre actors; all of the actors did an acceptable job in their roles. I love the very mature subject matter scene where they question the good for humanity, by trying to debate to killing somebody. There is a very touching scene with botanist Corazon (Michelle Yeouh) is holding the last alive plant like a mother, and symbolism getting stab through the chest. It can represent, how we as a society have and continue to destroy Mother Nature; for the sake of negatively selfish dogma thinking. I give mad props to Chris Evans as Mace, the ship's engineer. He pretty much looks like a leader. Other actors that did a great job are Cillian Murphy as the ship physicist Capa and psychiatrist Searle (Curtis Cliff). Too bad, Curtis Cliff had to leave the film for personal reasons, but the remainder of his shots had to shot with a body double. In my opinion, you can rarely see the different between the double and the real actor. There is two scenes with both, Capa and Searle bathing in sunshine as to represent being closer to God. Both are similar, both also different. In the Greek myth, Icarus is a man wanting to get closer to the Gods, so he made wings out of feathers and wax. The only problem is that when he flew too close to the sun, his wings burn and he fell down from the sky. In fact, Icarus makes a cameo, not only as the name of the ship, but in the last few minutes of the movie. So check that out. Without spoiling too much, Mark Strong as Pinbacker is just scary. The character is inspired by the character Pinback from 1974's Dark Star film. I think the movie would anger a lot of fundamentalism, but I thought the film brings the idea of hope to the strong front well. For a really dark sci-fi film, I think Sunshine is a horrible title for the film. I would have call it Icarus. Even Rose Bryne mistake the film for a romantic comedy at first. The movie is great thriller, with a lot of scary moments. Even the claustrophobic environment in the film is a bit scary. The special effects in outer space are convincing and remorseless. The film score by John Murphy is amazing. It became so popular that it's song was reused in hundreds of movie trailers, commercials, etc. etc. Overall: While, the film wasn't a big huge, I think it's a good thinking man's movie with great visual effects. This movie was bright, original, and it shine out pretty well. I'm happy that I did end up seeing it.</fullReview>

The sun is dying and they hope this bomb will start it again. The first crew fails and seven years later a second crew is sent being earths last hope.This movie was pretty good.

		<fullReview>A+Would it be wrong to call this film a modern day "2001: A Space Odyssey" or "Alien"? Even if its, I don't think I'm mistaken. Comparing Danny Boyle to Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott may seem a tad much, but after viewing the film I'm sure viewers will be inclined to agree. The film is a high-caliber thinker's science-fiction movie, just like those giants of old. It is not a Star Wars/Star Trek inspired flick where anything goes, and for the most part it is grounded in reality. The attention to detail is just stunning.The cast is really spectacular, this being one of the few films Chris Evans has starred in that I enjoy. Rose Byrne also stars, along with Mark Strong and Hiroyuki Sanada but my favorite performance goes to Cillian Murphy. Clearly a favorite of Boyle's, and Christopher Nolan for that matter, he does an incredible job. The actors encompass fear and tension very subtly, and the effect it has is remarkable. No to mention many of them embody what it means to lose your mind one little piece at a time. There are also many scenes where the line between fulfilling one's duty and plain inhumanity is blurred. Some say the second half is dismal, but far from it. It's what makes this film comparable to the likeness of "Alien", a true sci-fi/horror.The visuals are the film's highlight, and they are astounding. It gives off the aura of the terror of space, and at the same time the beauty of the taken for granted sun. Compounding all this is the orgasmic score by John Murphy. I know people tend to focus on the ever popular track Adagio in D Minor (even the sh*tty excuse of a film "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" used it in its theatrical trailer), but every minute of the score is to die for. It enhances the beauty, sharpens the terror, and is mesmerizing. Definitely see this movie for one of a kind science-fiction spectacle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boyle shows what could have been for Alien franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A team of scientists head to the sun to replace the failing power but encounter numerous problems upon reaching their destination.Danny Boyle has excelled in mastering genres during his still very young career. The controversial drama Trainspotting to the uplifting romance Slumdog Millionaire where he finally grabbed that well deserved Oscar.After declining an offer to direct an instalment in the Alien franchise in the late 1990's it seemed he had missed an opportunity to tackle the high market franchise, but here he shows us what could have been.After James Cameron shocked and thrilled us all with Aliens it was a devastating blow to see David Fincher stumble through the third part and even more upsetting to see Jean Pierre Jeunet try to capture the onslaught of Aliens and their lustful desires. Whilst Boyle's A Life Less Ordinary was intriguing it never sparkled with the Bury man's true intent but here we see a revitalizing spark and riveting plot dissolve in a stunningly set atmospheric scene of science fiction.We open with a crew on a journey to inject the sun with a longer lasting star and the intent and ambition of the dialogue spills with excitement. The slow talking yet technical jargon isn't too complicated as the intent and ambition is as clear as the sun.What is highly impressing in the opening stages is the lighting. It's remarkable to see the captain looking straight into the sun and increasing its power. It is quite a challenge to stay focused on the TV screen but this initiation of power allows us to see what the characters have set out to achieve.The plot is brimming with energy as the crew get closer and closer to their destination and inevitably certain problems start to occur and the stakes are raised. After the first major accident things really start to heat up and you can really feel the tension as the scripting becomes sharper and shorter, taking its place by action montages and frankly a bizarre murder chase in the dark.Having read reviews and hearing opinions about this 2007 picture was that the ending and final stages divided opinions. Quite understandably after being completely baffled by the meaning and context of which the final act was portrayed. However I do believe that this was a clever device to use as it is an interpretation by the viewer to decide, like what's in the briefcase in Pulp Fiction. It's important and individual.Danny Boyle has shown what could have been for the alien franchise here with a picturesque portrayal of life in the galaxy's hottest star and with stunning scene setting and a scripted thrilling narrative, this is a refreshingly exciting sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looking at the sun can be hazardous, looking at Sunshine can be rewarding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Boyle's Sunshine seems to take on an awful lot of famous baggage when it comes to pieces that helped in inspiring this picture. 2001; Solaris (the original); Alien and Apocalypse Now are all mentioned as sources close to Boyle's heart and mind when executing Sunshine, a big and grandeur science-fiction film that starts as a film about the potential destruction of the human race; develops into the would-be destruction of the crew through the dangers of the mission they're all on; before finishing on a note that sees the film pushed into the realms of the claustrophobic and quite terrifying. You can see where each of these sources of inspiration have done exactly that on screen at various points, but it is much to Boyle's credit that Sunshine doesn't come off as a daft pastiche of visuals and light, sci-fi content that quickly branches off into something far darker and dressed up.Here is a science fiction film about ideas, about the goal to use something more commonly associated with mass destruction for the purpose of saving life or bringing about life. But I don't think it's a mediation on exploring the means as well as purpose of weapons of mass destruction within our world, even if the film's premise revolves around the exploring of an unventured world for means of alternate use of said kind of weaponry. Rather, Boyle's film is about the awe of it all; the spectacle of both a broad 'other' world and the small confines of a human mind. A collection of astronauts are charged with making their way to the sun of our solar system in the year 2057. It's drying up, dying out and needs kick-starting otherwise the Earth will cease to garner light and life. The ominous sign, and something that acts as a threatening off-screen element, is that a prior mission came close but ultimately failed in their attempts to re-invigorate the sun. Boyle presents space as it should be presented; as a large, empty, quiet and quite scary place that few have ever delved into. Of the crew, the film predominantly focuses on Capa (Murphy), but he is refreshingly assisted by numerous others of varying ages and nationalities.Sunshine is a film fascinated with its surroundings; it feels as if it itself feels privileged to even be in space in the first place. The crew are fascinated with the sun, its aura and its power, with Capa in one scene engaging with the sun in a manner I'm not sure has been explored in the past. The scene in question produces a visceral kick for the character, a downing of the blinds and donning of specific eye-ware as you set carefully pre-planned levels in order to allow oneself the sun's full blast of light. It tears through the blinds and offers a rush into the mind, a sort of gloating; a sort of reminding that it's there, and that it's dying out, and that human-kind must make their own way towards it to alter the situation. In this sense; the sun is both their enemy but also remains their source of life but either way, the characters retain a certain perverted fascination with it, best displayed in that scene when Capa risks his well being for a sudden rush from the sun's energy.The film's setting is a spaceship named Icarus II, the sequel ship to the ill-fated Icarus I. Boyle effortlessly captures the space as a very closed in place of working, despite its large size. The film additionally carries a very delicate feel about it, which aids in the early exchanges and the slow-burning sensibility it has about it. This is much down to the setting of the spaceship as this thoroughly advanced and technologically driven locale far off in the future. Everything feels as if it has to be handled very carefully, with buttons and devices and various tasks that need to be completed in a careful manner; the feeling early on is very much in the vein of being relaxed, with no direct antagonism from anywhere, but with a very foreboding sense of uncertainty as we watch and entrust these characters with technology and tasks outside of the ship we have no knowledge of ourselves, and therefore fear the consequences if they go wrong. In a way, it echoes the passages the film will veer down later on, as genre and content become more mixed and therefore blurred.There is a very visceral feel about the film, a distinct emphasis on the visual, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is a clear case of style over all substance. While visually exciting and carrying a distinct sense of dread in all the technology on board twinned with the fact the crew are, essentially on a mission in which failure is unthinkable; Sunshine manages to capture fear and panic towards its denouement when the reality of the situation and the overall setting of the film become ingredients of pure fear and paranoia. A certain character has witnessed all this death and disaster around him prior to the finale, and has began a distinct descent into potential madness as reality is distilled through his own sub-conscience, before filtering out into what it is we're watching. Sunshine is a large budgeted science fiction film that comes across as very appealing, both visually and substantially; something that you don't always get these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something unexpected this way comes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sun is dying. The earth has frozen over. Mankind has one solution. The first attempt has already failed. It's now or never.The small crew of the Icarus II must navigate their immense nuclear payload toward the sun. Chances of returning home are remote, but there is little choice.Such is the premise of the new film from the Director/Producer team of Danny Boyle and Andrew MacDonald. (28 Days Later, Millions, The Beach, Trainspotting, Shallow Grave). The team never settle on a particular genre, moving with style from one film to the next.Once again they have brought in writer Alex Garland (The Beach, 28 Days Later) to fashion a realistic tale set in the not too distant future. In fact, most of the situations in the film are reality based and not fanciful as you might expect to find in a sci-fi tale. The film owes its roots more to the hardware and associated dilemmas of 2001 and Silent Running rather than Star Wars and yet manages to weave generous scenes of suspense without ever feeling forced. It's fresh and never resorts to cliché to get its occupants out of their frequent tight binds.Cillian Murphy (Red Eye, Batman Begins, Disco Pigs) is the designer of the payload and the most central figure in the film, but even he realizes that their mission is bigger than he or any other individual. As an actor, he also is aware that Danny Boyle is the main man behind this mission who directs with assurance and imagination. There are no real standout performances, although New Zealander Cliff Curtis makes an interesting attempt. Rose Byrne tries to look intelligent and sympathetic, but only manages to pull half of it off.The real star is the sun itself (sorry about the pun) and we're made sure we never forget its awesome presence. Its deadly power overshadows the Icarus and all within; their environment is claustrophobic, (reminiscent of the Nostromo from Alien), but with limited food, water and air, the mission cannot afford any mishaps or course deviation. Naturally, something unexpected this way comes.This is a tight, fascinating and tense film, though fans of Superhero style adventures will be disappointed, which perhaps explains why this film has not been more successful. While audiences seem to clamber for remakes and sequels, Sunshine stands out for its originality and intelligence. One wonders if that's the reason for its apparent bypass at the box-office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a brief summary of Danny Boyle's Sunshine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this review contains spoilers....read with caution:Danny Boyle's Sunshine while it was fun, I found that it contained many of the same clichés found in other space/water disaster epics such as Armageddon, Leviathan, Mission to Mars, Red Planet, Deep Star Six, Deep Impact, The Core, Abyss and mainly Event Horizon...its all there, I mean when a spaceship's crew's ultimate goal is to drop off a big-ass bomb payload directly into the sun and/or get the heck out of dodge or die trying, (it is a suicide mission) you know things cant end well for anybody...Like Event Horizon and some o' the other movies listed above, they also find a distress beacon from another ship ( the Icarus 1) sent 7 years earlier (its mission failed horrible, everybody died), and they also go towards the ship in the hopes of nabbing their bomb payload. how this is even possible is beyond me, since the bomb IS the umbrella portion of the spaceship.The spaceships look like giant umbrellas which is great if you stay on a fixed path directly into the sun, you stay in the shade, but not so great if you decide to TURN the ship to the left or right, as evident, parts of the ships taller antenna towers get burned to a crisp making a return nearly impossible. As with all space disaster flicks, I'm still wondering how well educated crews that can pilot these ships and do all these really complex maneuvers manage to always seem to screw up the mission royally or go so totally crazy they royally screw up everybody ELSE'S mission and kill everybody else until the last unfortunate crew member is forced to put them down like a mad dog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artful film with exquisite soundtrack.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Boyle's latest science fiction foray doesn't disappoint. You will find his films, as a whole, to be artful and insightful, marrying strong imagery and symbols with actors who truly seem "made for the part."Composer John Murphy teams up with electronic act "Underworld" to create an ethereal soundtrack that *breathes* soul into this movie. I would be a fan of this film even without the soundtrack, however this soundtrack creates moments rather than simply scenes. Sadly, due to legal wrangling (as always, somehow, seems to be the case with spectacular soundtracks), it looks as though the soundtrack will never be released. There have been false starts and random snippets of information stating that the soundtrack has (for over a year now) has been "on the verge" of release. I doubt we will actually see it's release as it will, ultimately, be as elusive as the soundtrack to "Rock &amp; Rule," and like the latter, I, for one, would kill for a copy.I recommend seeing this film if nothing else for the seamless marriage of image and music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant; best viewed with sunglasses and disbelief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Borrowing from such sci-fi luminaries as 2001, 2010, and Alien, Sunshine is, to pun the heck out of this review, brilliant. It's imaginative, believable, and awe-inspiring, using stunning visual imagery to supplement tight, cohesive ensemble acting and a well-reasoned premise. Unlike such recent deep-space movies as Armageddon and Event Horizon, Sunshine shunts aside the characterizations of the crew members in favor of truly special effects and a sincere sense of dread and danger.Fifty years in the future, the sun is dying. Oddly enough, this has nothing to do with either the sun's own aging process or the effect of human activity - it's a completely natural, if not wholly explainable, problem. So how do we Earthlings propose to solve this problem? By nuking the bejeezus out of the sun, thus reigniting it and restoring it to its literal and figurative splendor.Sounds simple, right? Fly on out to the sun, drop a huge bomb (the mass of Long Island, New York), and zip on home. Piece of cake. Only the same mission was undertaken, and the crew from that spaceship was never heard from again. Now Icarus 2, armed with his megahuge bomb, must avoid the mistakes of Icarus 1, without knowing what befell their predecessors, much in the same way that Dr. Floyd and his crew traveled to Jupiter to find out what happened an earlier mission (Discovery); and what did they find? That Man was not meant to meddle in such affairs. (Cue maniacal laughter here.) One way in which Sunshine works is that the crew members are never portrayed as supermen; they're simply astronauts and scientists, and each of the actors is completely believable in the role. You'd almost expect this to be an all-American crew (it's not) with an American manly man as its commander (the captain is Japanese). But the personalities of the crew members are intentionally stunted so that the audience can focus on the mission. That is, the feeling of anxiety mixed with terror. We at home feel just as uncertain about the mission - if it fails, everyone on Earth dies - as the crew does.The movie is exceptionally well cast, too. Cillian Murphy (Red Eye, 28 Days) is Capa, the ship's physicist; he's morose and pensive, and he's the only one who knows how to deploy the bomb (euphemistically called "the payload"). Michelle Yeoh (Tomorrow Never Dies, Memoirs of a Geisha) is Corazon, the ship's biologist; she's in charge of the oxygen garden (i.e., the greenhouse). Without the plants, there'd be no oxygen to live. Then there's engineer Mace, pilot Cassie, and psychologist Searle, to name a few others. Each performance is low key and empathic; you don't have characters suddenly going crazy in the depths of space, as happens in most other sci-fi movies of this stripe. Again, more focus on plot development than on preening psychoses.But even so, there are conficts on board Icarus 2: Mace and Capa clearly don't like each other, but there's also a conflict that's a little reminiscent (derivative) of 2001. Without revealing anything crucial, I can explain that although the ship's computer does countermand a direct human order, such obstinance is not due to conflicting orders. So you can rest easy that this isn't a ripoff of Clarke's masterpiece.Director Danny Boyle and cinematographer Alwin H. Kuchler succeed in presenting a jaw-dropping array of sun-ripened majesty. Not to put too fine of a point on it, but they allow the viewer to get a sense of the overwhelming mass and brilliance of the sun without the need for the suspension of disbelief. For example, the Icarus 2 has an observation room from which crew can view the sun head on - through strong, strong filters. Even with those filters on, Dr. Searle experiences a bath of light that envelops him both physically and mentally - he's never quite the same after observing the sun, and his exposure informs his character for the rest of the movie.Now, although the movie had a science consultant advising them on the practical aspects of the ship's mission, there IS some suspension of disbelief. For example - a bomb with the mass of Long Island? Into the sun? Come on, that won't be more than a raindrop in the Pacific. And how can the ship be so strong and resistant to heat that it can get close enough to deploy the payload? Wouldn't it just burn up? As with the best sci-fi, Sunshine asks more questions than it answers (not including the rhetorical ones I just asked). It teeters on the edge of classic science fiction but ultimately waits patiently on the plateau - or asteroid, if you will - of a near-classic. It's shiny, it's pretty, and it's thoughtful, but it's mystical ending might seem a little like a cop out to some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly taut, psychological science fiction thriller . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had my doubts about this one, as its limited release precluded the recognition it deserves. Reviewing the premise only made it seem mildly interesting, but I gave it a shot, and was glad for it . . .The writing is tight, with nary a scene wasted. The performances are excellent, making you care about the fate of the crew, especially in the scenes of self sacrifice. The music evoked the proper mood of such a dire mission.A strong case may be made that "Sunshine" parallels "2001: A Space Odyssey", "Event Horizon", and the original "Alien." But if such is done in a new way that works and doesn't feel derivative, all the better. The line between homage and derivation can be a fine one, but Sunshine manages to walk it with aplomb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very smart take on a difficult subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is a great study of what it is to be completely isolated from mankind. 8 crew members are sent on a mission to re-ignite the sun and "create a star within a star." It is very realistic and modest in its portrayal of the crew in that nearly half the crew are of Asian decent, and the break down of the others is very believable. The visuals are superb, and the chemistry between actors is wonderfully reflected in the film. One can really imagine these people living with each other for an extended amount of time. I especially enjoyed the emotions studied in the film such as guilt and desperation. There is one character in the film (try not to spoil much) who is so full of guilt that he actually has to be treated by the Psych officer on board the ship, which it would be completely believable that one would be needed. I also enjoyed the fact that some of the crew show their real animal instinctual side i.e. the Comm's Officer. He was actually my favorite character and struck me as the most "real" as far as the gravity of the crew's dire situation. You will see what I mean after watching the film. IN all honesty, the first half was my favorite, but the ending did not bother me, and it was a very beautiful way to end the film. I give this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful exploration into the light</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somebody, some obscure critic or reviewer out there, threw out a new term: "film blanc," the opposite of "film noir", which would be then a genre that currently consists of precisely two movies: The Fountain, and Sunshine. The idea is that now, with new digital technologies and bombastic directors with both the will and the way to make these features for Relatively Cheap (tm), now cinema has opened up to engage and enjoy the blinding high-definition of all of it--theatrical screen or no, modern movies have the ability to recreate sun-spots in your eyes.Sunshine has mostly been getting reviews that state that it has a ridiculous storyline but good performances, bad science but great visuals. Actually, it's storyline isn't too ridiculous, and the science is a tiny bit closer than people have been gripping about. But the point everyone latches onto, and rightfully so, is the visuals. Of course, it's easy to cite the epic proportions, the bright lights, but also is creative and new editing. In one moment, the characters have only flashlights to light their way, and whenever the flashlights shoot across the camera, flashes of faces of the crew appear. In that way, Boyle recreates the spotty eye effect. At another point, a strange horror narrative appears in the form of a monster/ex-captain who stalks around the ship, but even when directly on screen with no chiaroscuro to hide him, Boyle digitally defocuses the lens and washes out the color, making the technically human aggressor into a product of the sun-monster. Light, in this film, is of the essence, which of course is really what film is all about--capturing light. And films, which change form over time, sometimes seem like they're dying, and need a good Manhattan-sized bomb to rekindle.What's most interesting about both Sunshine and The Fountain is the tendency for people to compare them to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Actually, I would argue that Kubrick was always most interested, in his long takes and contemplative approach, in space, whereas these days space seems pretty well explored in film history. I consider these two films to be explorations in light, and the moment in this film where Murphy's physicist character says, "As we get closer to the sun space and time basically start becoming the same thing", we learn that all of this is a function of light--as Sunshine progresses, the build-up, the drama, the thriller and the tension are all a function of light, which is the ultimate transgressor of space and time.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An arty Armageddon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine continues director Danny Boyle and writing partner Alex Garland's appealing multi-genre streak, this time taking on the science fiction realm, chronicling an implausible futuristic expedition of a space crew attempting the most difficult task of reigniting a dying sun. Playing out almost more fantasy then science fiction, Boyle uses this concept to stretch his visual vocabulary into the stratosphere. While the concept, ensemble chemistry and plot execution itself leave much to be desired in the ways of providing viewers an intimate, accessible journey, the true gifts throughout Sunshine, and particular in it's very strong conclusion, remain this director's innovative, near-visionary techniques harnessing this solar energy through his lens.The film starts off rather slow, teetering off with under-explained minutia and littered with a less-then-impressive cast of characters solving more-then-predictable space station dilemmas. It takes a while to gain momentum but when it does, and as it rocket-propels into the stirring, visually transcendent climax, viewers are treated to nothing short of a directional tour de force of motion, shattering technical limitations to provide some of the most gut-wrenching, physically powerful space scenes ever captured in high resolution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fuh!!! It successfully conquered my mind!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main reason why it successfully conquered my mind is dominated by the way they made up this film, and also... the background of this film(in Icarus or even outside Icarus near the sun). First seemed there wasn't anything attractive in this film, knowing from the same location, just in Icarus.Well, when I watched it, I supposed it would probably be a good movie if they made the movie more interesting, like a truly adventure. I mean, not just doing a trip, but also mixed with the adventure. Honestly, I don't know how, but I'm sure they can do it. So I think the people who watched this film would feel more entertained.But, overall, it forced me to give two thumbs up for this one. Because I realize, that making-up this film wasn't an easy way to do. And I wonder if the sun really - really dies like the film was, I think that the people will send Icarus to the sun to "switch it on" again, he3X (Just kidding!!!) Unfortunately, I gave 9 out of 10 for this film. Why? Oh, I shouldn't have to say this. Because, the most ending part of this film was so "odd"! Well, I mean, it had made the film seemed so weird! I felt just a little disappointed for this one. I knew the sun lives again. But, how is the fate of Capa, his friend, and Pinbacker? I didn't know... I'm very sorry to say this. But in conclusion, I was sufficiently impressed with Sunshine. Congratulations!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could have been a masterpiece, but ended up "pretty good"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie came so close to being something outstanding. The tone and pacing of the movie is perfect throughout, until the madness of the third act. Like others, I can't help but equate it with Alien, The Thing, and other fantastic sci-fi movies. It has that eerie tension of an isolated crew destroying itself from within that can only be found in space or a polar setting. The gravity of being on such an important mission adds great weight to the feel of the film, accelerating the growing tension and psychological strain. I still very much enjoyed the film, but I thought that the story fell completely apart and should have been handled differently. The core computer as a personality was done excellently, and although the characters somewhat fit the sci-fi "ship crew" formula, it works well and the actors really pull it off. Worth seeing, but it won't be a classic. Too bad. 7.5/10</fullReview>

For some reason the director has a tendency to do this. He did the same with 28 days later. On saying that I can easily forgive him. I have already watched Sunshine four times on DVD.Heck.

		<fullReview>Danny Boyle has done it again, another amazing movie to his roster. Its a great movie, probably not as good as Trainspotting but still great none the less. Its driven by a strong sense of science fiction integrity with unique ideas of our world 50 years into the future. Unique ideas when it comes to having a actual greenhouse on the spacecraft in order to supply the oxygen and the display design of the computers which I'd swear was taken strait from 1998s pc game Starcraft.Aside from the great design the movie does have its inspirations. A mix of 2001 and Event Horizon the film takes a little from both. 2001s entire suit up to repair the ship scene and the entire Event Horizon idea of the burning man left on board. But asides from rip offs this movie had its own unique style of directing which quickly became annoying to very interesting at times. Its a weird explanation really, the times I believe its trying to show a view from the burning man but rather shows a distorted form of blurred image had become very annoying. The times however when the film with abruptly pause just to show a longer view of the image portrayed was rather brilliant.The films got its ups and downs, downs would have to go with the acting. Although not terribly flawed the acting wasn't the most impressive. For instance a scene when+Chris Evans was freezing could have easily been fixed if they had just soaked him in ice cold water before he did his lines which made his stutters far to out of place to be believable. He was also the best actor in the movie which says a lot.The acting overall is not bad enough to injure the plot, but there were many holes like the background of the burning man that wasn't highlighted. The movie in end does its work as its own unique blend of sci-fi and is much better then recent end of the world sci-fi movies (Day After Tomorrow). Its a great movie with catching twists that gives our today frozen sci-fi genre another sunny day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Setting minor plot holes aside, which are irrelevant to the over-all experience felt by the film, Danny Boyle has delivered a visually aesthetic adventure in space that prompts the viewer to think. How would you react being in a crew of eight, on an incredibly long and dangerous mission to save your planet by re-igniting the sun? How would you feel being one of the few to see something that no one else ever will? Although the movie lacked in character development, the film picked up quickly and kept its pace until the end. It's biggest strength was the incredibly beautiful cinematography, with every camera angle meticulously considered and aesthetically executed. The beauty, drama and intensity, however, would be nowhere as amazing had it not been for the perfect music score, which helped convey and accentuate the many emotions present throughout the film.Disregard the naysayers, whose main complaints revolve around the inability to suspend their disbeliefs. See the film for yourself, and perhaps you will see a wonderfully intriguing sci-fi survival/thriller/horror reminiscent to 2001, Event Horizon, and Solaris.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen quite a few sci- fi movies I have rarely felt totally happy after one. They often lack deepness and focus on action more than is needed. Space has always been my weak point, it has that supreme mysterity, that unknown power; a human being is nothing compared to it. Space movies need to be more than just another action clip with a mindless plot which could take place everywhere but the producers thought it would be cool it to be a space ship (that sentence wasn't a example of English grammar but you got the point).Sunshine doesn't fall into that category: It's smart and makes you think... and it's beautiful looking. Some people have been critizising the end but I find it quite provoking and intelligent. I don't want to spoil anything but if I say "I've been talking to god for the past..." people who have seen the film know what I'm talking about.The whole movie evolves around the mission: the Sun is dying and with it the whole human race; a rescue team has been sent to the sun to make it work again. That is the main plot. The characters are all played very well and the storytelling is fantastic as well as the directing.At the end of the movie I felt like I had learned something. I wanted to watch it again and I probably will tonight.One of the best sci-fi movies in the past 50 years. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious story has its moments, also some flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one is hard to vote on. It ambitiously and creatively blends several elements of the sci-fi genre, but it also is afflicted with some plot holes that the planet Jupiter could fit through.Overall, I'd say the movie entertains. However, that is only if you give it a wide (VERY wide) berth of suspension of disbelief. Without it, the premise that the sun would start to fizzle in 50 years (isn't it supposed to exist for billions of years?), along with the idea of dispatching astronauts to jump start it with (guess what:) a nuke, will be too distracting to swallow the story. The euphorically spiritual gaze at the sun in its solar fury is a thoughtful idea (which supports the plot well), but even this could be picked apart if one chooses to.The film is obviously influenced by several classic sci-fi movies, Alien and 2001 to name just a couple, there are others. The film does manage to avoid ripping scenes off, however (with a couple of exceptions), and applies the elements from these films in a different context, purpose, and meaning. The director, cast, and crew should be credited for this, as the production as a whole rises above the script. It's not a bad script, but it takes on too much and tries to meld it altogether. There's philosophy, technology, astronomy, action, violence, a murderous psycho, crew arguments over ethics, etc. All of these are valid points to explore, but there's just too much stuff thrown in the mix for it all to connect together properly. Trying to throw the pieces of a 1,000 piece jig saw puzzle, and then catch them in assembled form would be easier than what this film attempts.Still, the construction of the film allows enough cohesion for the essential message of the movie to be expressed artistically and dramatically. The action is paced well, with the right balance of pauses for the characters to evaluate situations. The set design of the ship's interior are innovative, and the exterior is original as well. An attempted escape from one ship to another is riveting and original in the unique peril the astronauts face (albeit not particularly realistic).Didn't love it; didn't hate it. However, it is watchable because it was so ambitious, and introduced so many topics of science fiction thought. Where it succeeds, and even where it fails, makes for some things to think about after the movie is over.</fullReview>

The plot was wonderful. It is a very original topic, and I commend the writers for their excellent writing. For me, the sci-fi genre was blown into a completely different direction. The idea of the sun would never have made me think of a good science fiction movie before today. The very reason I decided to write this review was that this was the most unique movie I have ever seen. The characters weren't very well developed. However, this is a great thing. In my opinion, if the main cast of characters is completely isolated, there is no need for large amounts of character development. Finally, the visuals. The visuals were absolutely stunning. If you want proof, a scene near the end of the movie is one of the most beautiful images I've ever seen. The visuals are the highlight of the movie, and the title of this review says it all. In summary, this is a must see movie. I was in tears as the credits rolled, an I kept thinking about the movie even while I was watching a different movie. All I thought about was the end of the movie so I could write this review, and I'm very glad I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunshine A Well Made Sci-Fi Thriller With Some Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine was a well made sci-fi thriller with some flaws by director Danny Boyle. I preferred 28 Days Later and Slumdog Millionaire over this one but Sunshine still isn't that bad of a movie it just could've been a little better. Boyle none the less continues to prove his skill as filmmaker with this one. The talented cast are admirable in their roles including Rose Byrne, Cliff Curtis, Chris Evans, Troy Garity, Cillian Murphy, Hiroyuki Sanada, Bendict Wong, and Michelle Yeoh. Some may lack screen time and development because they're written out before you can really begin to care for their characters but they make the best of their limited screen time because most of the movie especially the last half focuses on Cillian Murphy's character making him more of a lead than anyone else. Mark Strong makes a brief appearance sort of as a spaceship captain whose clearly lost his mind. Strong still does a good job with his cameo role in the movie. The special effects are state of the art and the few action sequences inside the ship are well executed. Boyle keeps the suspense going throughout the film that doesn't quite pay off but isn't a total failure either. The ending I sort of saw coming and it could've been better but the film tries to tell a message of the sacrifices some people are willing to make for the greater good. The film does leave questions answered that could have been revealed by the conclusion. Despite the films flaws however Sunshine is still an engaging sci-fi thriller with some suspense, a few surprises, and solid performances by the cast especially Cillian Murphy and Chris Evans who make this movie worth the time to watch at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit cold despite the sun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's by Danny Boyle, the very talented guy who did Trainspotting and Slumdog millionaire, and who tries his hand here at yet another genre. I liked the international cast, the suspense was captivating by moments, the sun and spaceship effects were cool (;-) and the philosophical underpinnings were interesting although I wish more had been done about it to give a proper pay-off at the end. For some reason, there's an X factor missing to this movie that would have pushed it in the sci-fi classic department. Despite the sun theme, the whole thing somehow felt too cold for me. Emotionally-wise, it could have been better. It's worth renting but not purchasing unless you're a Boyle fan or intellectual space sci-fi collector. Rating: 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot is really very stupid - the atmosphere and the good acting can't save it. The obvious stupidity starts with the reason for the whole mission - our star is dying ?!! Not for another 5 Billion years! - that's one of most accepted scientific facts. From there onward the stupidity continues with scenes of people freezing in less then a minute in space - no the vacuum doesn't conduct heat so they can live until they asphyxiate (and they don't expand and explode either like in other science fiction movies). But what bothers me more is the whole interaction between people was unrealistic. The people which we'll send if we'll need to save our planet will be selected out of 7-10 billion people possessing not only the highest intelligence, knowledge, skills, physical strength AND Mental Stability - but also totally dedicated to their mission!!! There won't be any fist fights and soul searching long before any serious situation develops. The Icarus team would have been selected out of hundred of teams world wide, trained in underground dungeons drilled to survive desperate situation without other human contact for months if not years. It is very obvious that many of the characters wouldn't pass the first week of training for this mission (fist fight, suicidal, selfish, talking to God ?!). I forgot the stupidity of the vast halls in the spaceships full of air to keep 5 people for another 10 years or more, For viewers that liked the atmosphere of the movie go see the latest Solaris (with George Clooney)- it's much deeper and interesting even though is not as good as Solaris -the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems incredible to me that this intelligent and exciting sci-fi movie could have come from the same team that presented us with the daft kiddie's zombie flick 28 Days Later. Had this film come first, it would have been easy to dismiss Boyle and Garland as creatively bankrupt after 28 Days Later was released, but on this evidence we have to assume (or at least hope) that the earlier travesty was simply a blip? Sunshine provides us with a genre cliché from the outset ? a crew of various character types on a mission to save the earth ? but proceeds to manufacture a tale as absorbing and gripping as any I've seen recently. It is helped immensely by the depth of characterisation: these people aren't automatons capable of handling any situation with absolute conviction; they have their own fears and problems and, more importantly, they make mistakes and errors of judgement ? even when they try to tackle the problems they encounter with a scientific logic. This is also unlike most other sci-fi action flicks in that there is little in the way of male posturing and heroics. What incidents there are ? two, by my count ? are treated with ridicule by both the writer and the female characters ('we have an excess of manliness' one of them dryly reports after one incident.) That the film loses its way in the final third is almost inevitable given the high quality of what has come before. Garland had a great vision, but obviously didn't know how to wrap it up and resorts to that other clichéd situation ? the stalk and slash ? without bringing to it the freshness he brings to the rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Dazzling and Magnficent Sound But Flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are echos of ALIEN (1979) from the mechanical corridors to the now famous kitchen scene. The are whispers of the eerie ALIEN sound effects. There is even a shot from FIRST SPACE ON VENUS (1962) with the growth of a plant. This movie almost descends to the level of EVENT HORIZON (1997), a science fiction film that turns into a horror movie, however, SUNSHINE apparently has more integrity by the end. Still the title, SUNSHINE while apparently obvious in its reference to the sun, should have been re-titled to SUNBURST or something with more flash and action. SUNSHINE is more correctly a science fiction thriller and incorporates whether intentionally or not a nice Japanese culturally backdrop with some of the crew as well as their honor. Strangely, this movie is both stereotypical and devoid of stereotypes. While there are not the obvious nerds, the flamboyant playboy, the scared beautiful seductive girl, there is plenty of macho male hormones that aren't really well explained except for their outrageous antics. There are also the frantic, hysterical females who unlike in ALIEN don't seem to get equal coverage. By the end of the movie, the editing and continuity seemed strained as several strands of scenes seem to get lost and there is of course the extra passenger strangeness towards the end of the movie. The brilliance of this movie, however, is in its visual delivery and the sound effect and soundtrack that helps to carry this movie. Unfortunately, this movie could have been among the best science fiction films, but the flaws in it detract from its apparent beauty. Seven out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star turn with a few blind spots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those in doubt of miracles need, every day, just look upwards. For the last 5 billion years it has burned with a constancy, and may do for the same number again, that is the source of life for almost every living thing on this planet (and for all we know the universe). The basis of Sunshine is a 'what if' scenario where that light in the sky we take for granted should start to fail.The reasons or consequences for the sun's failing light is not within the scope of Sunshine. There are no apocalyptic visions of earth and humanity a la Armageddon or Deep Impact. This is not a blockbuster in that vein. However, it is very much a homage to an earlier generation of sci-fi movies, inspired by the literature of Arthur C. Clarke, Asimov and others and in classic movies like 2001, Silent Running and Alien.Sunshine takes you on a metaphysical journey in the claustrophobic environment of a spacecraft on a rather desperate mission to reignite the sun with a huge atomic bomb, which comprises all the nuclear fissile material left on earth and represents humanity's last throw of the dice for survival. Initially the crew have little to contemplate apart from the final messages they will send home and their chances of success, whilst studying with fascination the disc of the sun itself as the grow closer.However, the discovery of a signal from the beacon of a previous failed attempt leads them to take choices which have consequences sending their mission spiralling out of control.Sunshine has much in common with Boyle and Garland's previous sci-fi collaboration of 28 days later: a clever scenario, a plot driven by character exploration rather than pure action, imaginative art design, a strong reference to a previous genre - in that case zombie movies, and a weaker sequence near the end than the film's beginning deserves.However, I found Sunshine a more enjoyable experience due to some fantastic effects and genuinely tense sequences. Whereas 28 days later's experiment with digital video was interesting but ultimately unattractive in a cinematic context, Sunshine has some beautiful composited shots, neat computer graphics that look like computer graphics and a stream of loving, mesmeric depictions of the Sun itself, which make it quite plausible that certain members of the crew would sit and gaze at it for hours.Somewhat less plausible is the science - both that the Sun would die in this way, and that a bomb that we could muster, however gigantic, would have any effect.Another aspect I struggle with is just how homage can stray into pastiche or downright plagiarism. Their is no doubt from where the screenplay derives its inspiration. There are plot sequences lifted almost directly from 2001, Alien, Aliens, Mission to Mars, Solaris and a number of others. The film however manages to blend them into a coherent whole and sustain the tension until the climax, although the final action setpiece is almost a direct rerun of 28 Days Later's mansion sequence.I went to see it on opening night and I noticed some people leaving the cinema, obviously having go on the slightly misleading all-action thriller premise of the trailer shown on TV. But if you like your science fiction intellectual and beautiful you will want to experience Sunshine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine: the basic building block for all life on our planet; the energy source that allows plants to photosynthesise and produce oxygen so that we can breathe, that lights our days and warms us - an indisputable good? Not so for the crew of Icarus2, a spacecraft sent to revive a near-future dying sun through the delivery and detonation of a massive nuclear device. For the assembled pilots and scientists, the sun is something to be marvelled at from behind heavy filters on the ship's viewing platform, but also something terrible to be feared and avoided at all costs.The first thing to say about Sunshine the film is that it is not "great". There are too many flaws in the plot, too much cliché and the rescue mission to Icarus 1 seems forced - when the possibility that this might happen was raised in the film, was anyone in any doubt that Icarus 2 would, indeed, change its course to meet up with Icarus 1 and that this would be the source of the crew's downfall? The justification for the diversion given in the plot does "kind of" work, but we all know that the writer wanted to send his characters to Icarus 1 and then thought up the reasons why they might need to do so afterwards.But I think all this can be ignored for one simple reason: - this film is absolutely and incomparably and "tears streaming down the face" beautiful. The Sun is, itself, a central character and the obsession that the crew come to have with its beauty and terror is made utterly believable and understandable to the viewer. Moments like when the crew assemble in the viewing room to watch Mercury pass across the front of the sun are simply stunning and, if there was nothing else in the film of interest, would still make it worth going to see.**Spoiler**I was a little confused, initially, why the film-makers felt that they had to introduce the "religious monster" captain of Icarus 1 into the plot - a few reviewers have suggested that this was to make a fairly clanging point about religion vs. science. But the more I thought about it, the less significant the religious element seems to be. What I was left with was a sense that this character represents what happens when human arrogance is combined with powerful, but imperfect, scientific knowledge and abilities. The crew of Icarus 2 believe they have the power to revive a dying sun - to change the destiny of the universe - the captain of Icarus 1 is introduced to show us just how pathetic and insignificant we actually are when put before the awesome power and terrible beauty of a star.So in conclusion, definitely go to see this if you enjoy watching films that paint beautiful images and make you think, but don't go expecting water-tight scientific explanations for plot points or anything new in terms of "space sci-fi".</fullReview>

(*)If you are going into the space it is not the coldness what would kill you first - it is the pressure. (*)Some super-enemy appeared. I didn't like that.

		<shortDescription>Don't Waste Your Time or Money!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was impressed by the award and nominations for this movie and was looking for a movie to buy on Blu-Ray that I hadn't already seen. Big mistake, complete waste of time and money. Science fiction movies in particular must be careful to maintain a viewer's suspension of disbelief or else lose the whole premise of the story. I was already skeptical about a dying sun in the year 2057, the anticipated rekindling of its energy with a bomb no bigger than Manhattan Island, the artificial gravity in the spaceship, and a group of such wacko characters being selected for a mission of such importance to humanity. Finally, the loss of radio communication outside the orbit of Mercury and the weird manifestation of the suicidal Pinbacker, capable of living over six years alone while waiting for an Icarus II and a highly improbable rescue rendezvous, lost me completely. Besides these liberties, it's otherwise a good movie visually and metaphorically but most of the scenes are very derivative from other sci-fi work and the character development is severely lacking which is why I rated it so poorly and would advise investing your time and money elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nearly everything about this story/film was utterly illogical. Thoroughly disappointing - considering the film-makers' previous efforts.As one who has seen and read many, many science fiction stories, books, and essays, this must rank as one of the most misguided. Whatever the film-makers intent, I didn't get it - and worse, the characters were laughably unbelievable, and made me care not for a moment for any of them. If the characters portrayed were supposed to be scientists of any means on this vital mission to re-ignite the sun, then I would have to conclude (as others here have) that the film makers had never met or even read interviews with any scientists. Ever.I see no point in summing up the 'plot', which has more holes than your average spaghetti strainer. If it was meant to be horror, there was nothing scary. If it was "science-fiction" then where was the science? Even if one could assume it was a philosophical essay about human nature and the fate of humanity, then we are surely doomed, if only by our own egos... never-mind mis-calculations or mistakes.How anyone could even get past the premise that we wouldn't simply send an un-manned (robot) space-ship to carry out this important but extremely dangerous mission is mind- numbing. Adding insult to injury is the hodge-podge manner in which the visuals and ship computer in a very poor way desperately 'borrow' from 2001 to laughable effect. Do yourself a favor and watch the original. Better story, better visuals, better acting, and far more believable (and scary, I might add).Save your time, money, and brain-cells. Go watch a GOOD science fiction film and avoid this altogether. A bitter disappointment on all counts that dies under the smothering weight of every poor cliché they can throw at us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why have astronauts on this mission?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a decent sci-fi thriller, with good characters and some good tension. But I wanted to comment on a couple things in the movie that stood out for me.***SPOILER ALERT! *** First of all, why would there be people aboard this ship? This movie is set way into the future, and yet, even here in our own time we are doing amazing things with robotic space missions. We landed many rovers on Mars, and even landed satellites on asteroids and comments! We could easily sent a "bomb" to the sun to self detonate. Why waste human lives? Also, if the ship had been totally robotic, the mission would have succeeded without incident! It was the human element that put the mission at risk and caused the first mission (Icarus 1) to fail! So really, this movie was based on a flawed premise from the very beginning.I liked the golden space suite, though. That looked like C3-PO from Star Wars if he was on steroids. Just imagine if C3-PO took a bunch of steroids and started working out in a robot gym everyday for a few years, and maybe even competed in the Mr. Robo-Olympia. He would look like the golden space suit in this movie. And instead of sounding like Anthony Daniels, he would sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger, but still say all the gay things that C3-PO always says.Also, why was the bad guy blurry? At first, I thought Danny Boyle was just blurring out his image for cinematic effect. But then, later on in the movie, the bad guy seemed to have the power to make himself blurry. That seems like a really strange super power to have...to make yourself blurry? Out-Of-Focus Man? Would that be a good super villain name?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By now you probably know this is supposed to be a think piece as opposed to fun. And believe me, this movie is anything but fun. As an artist, I struggle to get through a movie like this so I can give it a rating. This is best fast forwarded through, at super sonic speed. A group of scientists plan to reignite a dying Sun with a nuclear device the size of Manhattan. At least we've got an idea, but that's where the assets end. We have no idea who the characters are, and are constantly guessing even how many there really are. The sound is horrible. The characters are very silly. The plot and action is so horribly directed and filmed, the viewer has absolutely no idea what is going on. Very much like "2001", which was also disjointed. Horrible writing, filming, and directing doesn't mean it's a work of genius. And someone needs to point that out. I'm giving the movie the benefit of the doubt by rating it 2 out of 10. It does have a style. I won't deny that. But the style is just one of nervousness, of a constant ill feeling. Only for the die-hard masochist. I would like to be more specific, but if you make the mistake of watching this bomb, you'll realize that the confusion makes it impossible to be specific. A defined style-but a pitiful one, and a flop of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie didn't start out very well for me. Were we suppose to believe that our sun will start to die in the year 2057? Maybe I didn't pay enough attention to the plot, but why was the earth cold? When our sun dies, I was under the impression that the temperature here on earth will increase (enough to boil off our water). OK, so I pretended I didn't hear some vital information and tried to enjoy the rest of the movie.But wait, I was also suppose to believe that we would place the destiny of our planet on only eight people, each of whom had specific jobs that only they knew how to do? Still, I didn't want to turn it off at this point because I was sure that it had to be better than doing my work that was piling up. To enjoy the movie I had to believe that we could build a space vessel that could only produce enough oxygen to support this many people.The character development was OK. They created a feel for who the main guys were, which gave insight into their actions. Visually, nothing was amiss, so by the middle of the movie I thought it was doing much better.Unfortunately, then came more unbelievable plot. As scientists they all should have debated whether or not to go off track to investigate the signal from the first Icarus mission. Well, this wouldn't have made for an interesting movie if they had gone on with their mission, so I went along for the ride. Then when I was suppose to believe that calculations and changes to their flight course wouldn't have been double checked by another crew member, I had to roll my eyes. I was hoping that this was about to create a good finishing plot.The rest of the movie was mildly interesting until the end, which was anticlimactic for me. There were more episodes of disbelief that had to be ignored. Still, the acting wasn't terrible, the visual effects were alright, and it was better than doing my own work, so I give it a 6.</fullReview>

No way would these idiots be the ones sent out by Earth. There's got to be smarter people on the planet. The series of "mistakes" these people make FOR NO REASON AT ALL are simply to move the suspense of the story along.

		<shortDescription>Astounding visuals, unfulfilled story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sci fi space film has been stagnated for several decades now. There seems to be only one acceptable scenario allowed; lonely massive spaceship with some sort of monster on board. The only exceptions are the Star Wars series, the Star Trek franchise with "Chronicles of Riddick" and "Firefly" the sole individual exceptions. "Sunshine" seems to be breaking the mold but unfortunately falls right back into it.The idea of a spaceship on a desperate journey to save the planet Earth has a number of intriguing possibilities especially in the philosophy department. Setting up that the spaceship can no longer communicate with the planet ups the ante several notches. Unfortunately the film makers ultimately decided to tread where many have gone before. The comparisons to "Solaris" (the Russian original) and "Mission To Mars" made by others here are apt. Solaris is a conceptually dense philosophical film using a scenario that is impossible except in a sci-fi film. Mission to Mars is an empty husk only concerned with getting from one plot point to another, nothing to think about here. Sunshine is attempting to reach the conceptual heights of Solaris while employing the storytelling level of Mission to Mars. Therefore nothing really works in the end. You can't try to stimulate the intellect while presenting some very obvious, flawed logic and barely filled characters.Many of the logic problems are already mentioned by others but what sort of space agency would send up the last hope for humanity and not train the crew to replace other crew members in an emergency? In this film only one guy knows how to set off the bomb, another guy is the only one who can program the navigation computers and set the mirrors, another is only a psychiatrist and so on. What sort of idiot space agency operates like that? And for that matter, why do you need to send a manned ship when you are just going to toss a bomb into the sun? The public already knows what we can do with robotic missions!One last issue I have. The concept of setting the film only 50 years into the future is a mistake considering the issues we are having with global warming now. Global warming? That's no problem, the sun's blinking out! And we can fix it with a pill! If it was set hundreds of years into the future the film would have worked better.Beautiful effects and soundtrack until the mismatched rock over the credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunshine Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a highly inspirational movie. A must-see-movie for astronomical guys and science geeks. Whether or not the idea in the movie is valid it doesn't really matter due to the director's stress on mainly concerning innovative ideas, acting, high patriotism illustrated towards science and humanity. The movie contains hair-raising graphics and soundtracks. Also the movie depicts all hazards involved in outer-space. The director has created an emotional force for certain scenes which show reality, depicting effects on a space voyage towards sun with an aim to save humanity. There are some awe-inspiring beautiful scenes concerning celestial bodies. Overall the movie raptures the audience with it's content with its music accurately played for particular scenes which conceals possible flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with potential that does not deliver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am giving 2 stars to Sunshine, 1 mostly in view of the stunning visual effects,apparently also achieved with a relatively low budget, and the second for a fairly good first act. The movie was particularly disappointing because I viewed it in two sessions and where I left it off it was still holding it's own. When I resumed viewing it the next day it fell apart rapidly and shamelessly.Others have already pointed out the several plot flaws of the movie, so I won't repeat them here. The premise is shaky at best, but I have learned a long time ago to cut this kind of movies some slack. After all, if I want science there is a TV channel dedicated to it plus, there are always books.I have also long given up on spaceships and stellar phenomena somehow generating sound in movie theaters. I believe that absolute silence when watching a star or a spaceship explode could be even more dramatic than a cheap sound effect, but apparently the Hollywood types disagree. Maybe the Sound engineer union has it in their contract.However, after giving in the major premise and a few other scientific impossibilities it seemed that the film makers made it a point to make this thing as scientifically implausible as possible and make the plot just as unbelievable.Here are some baffling inconsistencies, in no particular order that managed to drive me nuts. They are not the only ones by far, but the ones I remember as I write this:No redundant computer systems in humanity's last hope? How did the Coppertone poster boy managed to go from Icarus 1 to Icarus two? There is only one air lock in the crafts and they were standing in it. Plus, how did he rip the interlocking mechanism apart? Jaws of life? (and on this note: I presume the first failed space mission was also billed as "humanity Last hope" 7 years earlier. Why name it "Icarus 1"? Did they know there was going to be a second one?)What is going on with gravity on that ship? The ship does not rotate (the antennas do for some bizarre reason), yet everyone is solidly anchored to the floor. The computer cooling system is a vat of liquid that should the mysterious "gravity making" device fail it would scatter into tiny droplets. Nice thinking. Gravity also seems to be tied in with breathing air. In the air lock scene our hero is floating in the golden suit inside the air lock. Yet as soon as the air returns he slams to the floor. What? The computer is an idiot. Tracks an intruder but only thinks of lerting the crew in a "by the way" fashion. They are running out of air and have only 12 hours do deliver the payload. Yet, there are vast areas full of breathable air all over this vast ship. The payload hold alone would be good for several weeks. And let's not even dwell on the payload delivery method. Why would humans be necessary to place a nuclear payload on the Sun? We have self driving cars, planes and spaceships today, you would think that if we could build Icarus we could figure out an automated navigation system, at least for the last part of the mission.In conclusion, the movie has both plot and scientific holes you could drive a supertanker through. The science adviser of the movie must be a really frustrated fellow, but so are most of the viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What initially started out as a visual effects and directorial master piece turned into a semi B grade ending leaving you with the big question mark hanging as to why a perfectly good movie was ruined.I am a fan of Cliff Curtis from his humble beginnings and he has never let me down in any movie including this one. Biased because I am a kiwi too :) All the actors gave good performances. It was the screen play and directing at the end of the movie that let the movie down.I was a little like "you are kidding right" when we are lead to believe that a scientist/crew member forgot to allow for the SUN when changing the course of the ship and hence the heat shield was not also adjusted resulting in some damage to the shield itself which led to a whole series of problems.However this was minor compared to what happened later in the movie.Little things like why would Cappa, upon finding out their was a fifth unknown person on board, go running to the observation deck to confront this person and yet not bother tell any of his other crew mates to get some "backup". That would be the first thing anyone with any intelligence would do. HELLO this is what happens in lame B Grade horror flicks when upon entering the haunted house everyone immediately splits up to be predictably picked off one by one...yawn.Oh and what possible explanation was their for Pinbacker only being displayed in a wavy,hazy double image type way apart from covering up hopeless special effects on his burned beyond recognition body??? Also towards the end the storyline was disjointed and you didn't know how characters got from one scenario to the next.Overall I still enjoyed it and would recommend this movie as long as you make some allowances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak storyline but good special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like sci-fi as much as anyone but this movie had a super weak plot line. The premise of saving the earth by reigniting the sun is a good theme, but whoever paid to put this story on screen should be sent to the sun. Just because it's sci-fi doesn't mean the audience will be blown away by the effects and not care if there is a story.The special effects were good but they always seemed to be the same distance from the sun, so we never really know when it's time to complete their mission or just hang out.That was a lot of good acting talent just gone to waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>started out great and then rapidly went downhill.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had everything, a good director with a solid body of work behind him, a fairly healthy budget but not too big and a pretty good cast too. Unfortunately it has Alex Garland writing and here lies the problem, Alex Garland is not John Hodge and this is a fact that Danny Boyle seems completely unaware of. Alex Garland is a novelist, not a screen writer and this becomes very apparent when looking at his work.Sunshine starts out and it's atmospheric and clastrophobic, I thinking it's got a very good '2001' thing going on. The set up for the story is sound and the science seems movie credable. Then things start to go wrong for the characters, OK well this is a movie it was bound to happen. Then they get even worse and suddenly the whole film changes. I find myself in a paranoid piece that reminds me almost of 'The Thing' except the plot doesn't grip nearly as tightly. Characters start dropping like flies but they have been so underdeveloped that I really don't care about their fates. Then, guess what, the whole film does another massive switch and I find myself watching something along the same lines as 'Event Horizen'. I'm starting to think Garland must have just watched his favourite movies and then blended the plots together to create something he passed off as his own. Then came the ending of the movie and OH MY GOD I was left in a state of confusion and relief (I've never been so happy to see credits roll since I sat through 'Pearl Harbour'). The ending makes no sense and the bits that do are just boring. They all die in the end but, as I said before, I really didn't care.Sunshine would make a good book but it made a god awful movie...Garland should write it as a book actually, then write another one and then another. Hopefully it would stop him from writing dreadful scripts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Could Have Been Great, But It Ended Up All Muddled.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie started out promisingly enough but then went completely off the rails. Sunshine just can't seem to make up its mind about what it wants to be and by trying to be many different kinds of sci-fi films, instead of focusing on one type, it fails on most levels.The basic concept is promising, a group of earthlings are sent to sort of "jump start" our Sun which has petered out for some non-explained reason. The probability of this kind of mission being technically feasible even fifty years from now is highly unlikely, but you accept this kind of thing in most science fiction films. It is therefore up to the filmmakers to make this impossible story seem believable.Sunshine starts out gloomy and introspective (an homage to Tarkovsky's Solaris by chance?) but then the film switches to a more plot driven mood when the protagonists decide to investigate what happened to the previous mission, which was also sent to re-start the sun, but was lost in space apparently. After that, the film abruptly shifts into Alien-like territory when a seemingly insane surviving member of the previous mission starts chasing everyone around. The stupidity is increased by the fact that even though this guy has been horribly burned and is covered with keloid scar tissue, he sports bizarre, almost super human strength. What? Where did this plot element come from? Really, if Sunshine had played like a straightforward sci-fi monster thriller, it would have been fine. If Sunshine had stayed with its earlier introspective mood, it probably would have failed at the box office, but it would have kept sci-fi geeks arguing for decades. If Sunshine had just remained a drama about a group of astronauts getting sidetracked on their mission to re-start the sun, that would have been OK also.But in trying to do all these things, Sunshine ended up succeeding in none of them and was a mish-mash that sputtered along in fits and starts, occasionally building up real tension or interest before immediately bogging down in another lost plot point. This was the most disappointing film I've seen this year since Zodiac.Some of the scenes were great; near the beginning, we sit with the crew as they watch the planet Mercury pass by the Sun on their huge viewing screen. Mercury appears as this pathetic little dot with a huge Sun behind it and it is a surprisingly beautiful and moving special effect, which hammers home the immensity of the Sun and the fragility of the puny celestial bodies that orbit this rather unremarkable star. The movie needed more scenes like that one.I don't hold movies to high standards when it comes to technical or physical realism, but I had to question their spacecrafts heat and radiation shields becoming so carelessly mis-aligned near the start that causes a crisis. In a mission to the Sun, nothing would be more important than heat and radiation shields, you would fry to a crisp in an instant from the slightest error. It seems inconceivable that the shields could be so carelessly forgotten by an astronaut.Another problem I had was that gravity seemed to just appear and disappear whenever it was convenient (or not) for the astronauts and not in any kind of coherent fashion. And there were some things that were just too predictable. When Cillian Murphy (the films main star) and the Asian actor who plays the captain go outside to fix some heat shields, while they were still suiting up I leaned over and told my friend that the Captain (played by an actor I have not heard of) was a goner. Less recognizable actors tend to die earlier in general, but this was ridiculously predictable. Overall, Sunshine was trying to do something original and different, but it failed to hit the target. If Sunshine manages to raise any philosophical issue, it is this; Does a species capable of making a film this convoluted and disjointed deserve to survive if the Sun blinks out?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danny Boyle, how far hast thou fallen!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's sad to see great directors misfire on all cylinders, but this is exactly what happens here.I believe "Sunshine" is one of those doppelganger films developed by competing studios - you know, "Antz" vs. "A Bug's Life", "Volcano" vs. "Dante's Peak", or "Armageddon" vs. "Deep Impact"...In this case, "Sunshine" must have tried to compete with "The Fountain", and ended up as a failure of catastrophic proportions. It misses the philosophy; it misses the catharsis; it misses the visual style; even the music is uninspired.While everyone on Earth is freezing their butts, we're supposed to believe that detonating a "star bomb" - a type of fission-fusion super firecracker - will somehow make the sun recover its brilliance. Yeah, right. Even "The Core" had a more plausible idea.And what about the cast? Leave aside the bad science (one-gee gravity on a spaceship, impossibly efficient heat shielding, and one of the worst clichés you can think of - sound in space!) Leave aside the badly-developed premise. It's really a pity that we end up with unsympathetic characters - do we really care if they live or die? Even "Mission to Mars" had better fleshed-out and more differentiated crew members. Here, we just have senseless interactions and bad, bad dialogue. "Event Horizon" - which had problems of its own as a film - had, at the very least, two great actors with strong physical presence and memorable voices: Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne. "Mission to Mars" had the very competent Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins, as well as the beautiful Connie Nielsen. When you compare these thespians with Cillian Murphy, an individual who mumbles half his lines, has a somnolent delivery, and a permanent, slightly disturbed expression on his face, you can't help thinking that something is terribly wrong. Two other great Asian actors, former martial star Michelle Yeoh and Hiroyuki Sanada (who gave us a memorable performance in "Twilight Samurai") are criminally under-utilized and summarily disposed of, with barely a few lines of dialogue.The fact is, after wasting 90 minutes of your life on this film, you realize you've already seen it. It's as if someone had taken an element of every great - or at least box-office successful - science-fiction film of the last 20 years, and came up, somehow with something which is less than the sum of its parts.You have "A desperate mission against all odds"; "An awestruck, loving &amp; sensible female crew member"; " A distress signal which shouldn't be there"; "A mysterious space relic"; "An intelligent, but haunted and secretive medical officer"; "A freak accident which destroys the chain of command"; "A villain of superhuman strength, complete with peeling skin"; "Religious hysteria"; "A rapidly-diminishing oxygen supply (in an otherwise huge ship!??)"; "A dead computer which needs a complicated reboot procedure"; "A space walk without space suits"; "A noble suicide to save humanity"; "A providential bomb which saves the day"... the list can continue, but you get the point. Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention "A human who can detonate said bomb following an intricate procedure, at the precise critical moment,better than a computer, and without any other mechanical help"....Yeah. Sure. May the Force be with you! If you see existentialism and spirituality here, like some other reviewers seem to indicate, you're in the wrong theatre.Last but not least, I want to express my profound disgust with the overused cliché of "shaky-cam"... I hope the next director and camera-men who think Shaking and Blurring the frame are cool filming procedures will end up with a really bad case of Parkinson's. Shaky frames are not cool, mmmkay? They are tiresome and, frankly, already old. You can't create tension artificially, if that tension is not present in the script and the game of the actors - you're just giving the audience a headache. If you think using state-of-the-art equipment gives you the creative license to shoot video as bad as cellphone footage from a crowded bar, you should stop using whatever medication you're on.I am really sorry for Danny Boyle and Alex Garland. I can only hope that they take a good rest before proceeding with their next project, which is supposed to be none other than the sequel to "Trainspotting". Because just like the sequel to "28 Days", "Sunshine" is a terrible flop. Honestly, if you digitally remove the name of the director from the credits and insert "Roger Corman" in its stead, you get a better understanding of why this film is so rushed, incomprehensible and, in the end, a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait for this to come on DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On DVD you will be able to enjoy the fantastic visual effects. Thats the best thing about this disappointing film that blends Event horizon with 2001.The Characters mumble their lines and offer nothing new to the formula unbeaten in Alien. The Pinbreaker Character is no better than Sam Niel in Event horizon and the beautiful makeup work is entirely wasted by horrible anamorphic and shaky-cam. This could have been a great film but as usual there seemed no one who was prepared to say " This isn't working in the script..so its not gonna work even with pretty effects" It seems that the more money Boyle gets the less his films work,he is an inventive filmmaker and I love his films apart from when his budget allows for unconstrained film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Narrative Jump - Missing Footage??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an inexplicable jump halfway into the film - and several people in the cinema I saw it in felt that maybe a reel had been missed..... After the oxygen garden has been destroyed, an assessment is made of how much oxygen is left. There is a scene with Cassie and Capa, where it is suggested that 3 of the crew will have to sacrifice themselves to leave enough oxygen to even reach Icarus I. "That's a lot of short straws" says Capa. Then the film seems to jump abruptly forward to the away team preparing to board the Icarus I - there is no further narrative showing if they drew short straws or how they had the oxygen to get there, and nothing showing the rest of their journey to Icarus I, or how they managed to locate it. a) was this everyone's experience of the film, or did we see a special edition with something missing, and b) does that jump make sense to everyone else?? The only thought I have is that it is meant to resemble the jump in 2001 - when Dave is watching the emergency Mission Video after shutting down Hal, and then we are suddenly in the pod at the start of the last act 'journey to the infinite'...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Sunshine a lot. It's not the typical/traditional Sci-fi movie with planets, aliens, lasers, monsters and explosions everywhere, but thats exactly why I liked It. Not that I don't like "traditional" Science Fiction movies with the above- mentioned things, I definitely love those, but Sunshine was just different. First of all It had a beautiful visual side, at moments even breathtaking. Actually the visuals alone make the movie stand out but also the acting and the sound was great. There are plot holes in the movie though, or things you know just can't be done only 50 years from now, but on the other hand there are so many other believable things in Sunshine and the movie is just so damn beautiful that you don't want to pull It down. Also you might argue that everything goes a bit "over the edge" towards the end, but compared to Aliens, Riddick, Serenity etc, etc It's nothing really.Overall I found Sunshine to be a great refreshing take on a genre that as of late, has been somewhat streamlined and even a bit boring. To sum It up...Sunshine had an interesting and in some ways a very realistic story, It was well acted, had mesmerizing visuals, good music and not exactly a Hollywood ending and that makes Sunshine a memorable and stylish Sci- fi movie in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film last night, having seen just a billboard advert for it and noting it was British, I thought I'd take a look. The fact it was by the same team as created 28 Days Later held no weight for me as I have not seen it.As you may have read elsewhere, the effects in this film are effective and sometimes overpowering, even taking centre stage over the actors. This is not necessarily a bad thing as they enhance and enrich the visuals markedly. We know that space is silent, but the sounds are well used and serve to heighten the viewers perception of what is happening.The characters are well portrayed and by the end of the film we are quite attached to them even though it takes some time to feel at home in their company at the start due to the somewhat slow lead into the film, which plods along at a pedestrian pace for the first 20 minutes or so. The action soon picks up and you find yourself thinking in the role of the characters...would I do that? The last 20 minutes of the film pushed a little too much, which takes the edge off a higher score, but this does not detract from the film overall.This film is very enjoyable. British films have come a long way in a short space of time and can match a lot of what Hollywood produces in terms of quality for a fraction of the price.Having watched this, I will now make sure I see 28 Days Later as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sci-Fi Character Study Which Falls Apart in the Final Act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a tremendous fan of Danny Boyle, I was almost certain that I would fall in love with "Sunshine", his take on a common Science-Fiction story.The film was superbly cast, featuring a strong combination of international talents including Hiroyuki Sanada, Michelle Yeoh, Cliff Curtis, Chris Evans, Rose Byrne and Cillian Murphy. For the most part it was beautifully shot, written, and directed, featuring many positively stunning moments.But where the film struggled was in the final act, when it seemed as though the movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a character study masquerading as science-fiction, or the next Alien/Predator analog.All in all it was a solid film, and one I would recommend for anyone's film library. I just wish that Alex Garland could have found a stronger way to bring it all to climax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night we watched the movie Sunshine. It was awful. Really, really bad.For starters it is a pastiche of every science fiction movie you have ever seen, 2001, Event Horizon, Solaris, Star Trek, you name it, they've stolen ideas, dialog, plot points, visuals, anything that isn't nailed down. It is such a fine-grained pastiche that it is almost like a tile mosaic made from the shattered remains of other science fiction films. I read reviews that praised this aspect of the film, implying that such a knowing 'omage' made it more enjoyable, but it wasn't, it just felt hackneyed and ridiculous.Also, the story was ridiculous. It seemed like a bunch of drunken frat-boys and their wan, winsome teenage girlfriends are chosen for a mission to save the earth in a spaceship with a retarded but super-intelligent version of Hal, but Hal is a girl.The oldest crew-member looks about 35, the rest in their 20's. WTF? And they all fight and argue and question orders and behave like churlish morons the whole time. I mean what was the government of earth thinking? Oh, and while we are at it, who where the engineers that where hired to design the ship? The thing is a giant solar panel with a spindle of a ship strapped behind it, the panel acts as a heat shield, but for some reason, even though there is a strong coupling between the trajectory of the vehicle and the angle of it's shield it is possible for one of the drunks on the ship to change course without altering the angle of the shield. Bad engineering. (Also, Haless is always, like every second sentence, saying 'I can't let you do that Dave, it will endanger the mission', yet she lets this guy set the freaking ship on fire, WTF?). Another example; The drunkenest, fightingest crew-member has to dive into super-cooled fluid to fix the ships computer every two minutes and the tube he dives into is so cramped that he gets his leg caught and dies! Assuming you have to keep Haless's mother-boards in the drink then why the hell wouldn't you build access tubes in to your cooling tank? and maybe provide some thermal scuba-gear? OK, so the characters are believable if you believe that they hire astronauts by sending hookers to University bars to see who can take the most vodka-shots and still get a hard on, and the ship, and it's idiot-bossy computer are believable if you think that engineers of the future will actually copy the style of reasoning Hal exhibits and also build a ship by throwing darts blindfolded at old star-trek schematics, but the physics, oh the physics.There is always gravity on board the ship which appears to be huge but when Cillian Murphy is running around the surface of the enormous cubic bomb (it's like, and I mean exactly like, the outside of the cube in the movie Cube) there is gravity on multiple sides of the cube, he runs off a cliff, falls, only to stand up again on the cliff face and run around some more? Also the cube is falling into the sun. From the suns surface. and tumbling. without heating up, without affecting the gravity of the inside of the cube. wtf.Finally the monster, and this is a 'spoiler' if saving you from seeing this idiotic movie can be said to spoil anything, the monster is another drunken frat-boy astronaut from a previous mission, who is burned for some reason that is never explained, and runs around naked, killing people for reasons that are also not really explained (he wants to be alone with 'God' meaning the sun).So we are meant to believe, that the captain of the previous mission, descending into madness, decided that it was wrong to drop a bomb into the sun, and then killed his crew by burning them instantly into dust, becoming only slightly singed in the process himself, and then, on the off chance that earth might build another ship, send it to exactly where he was and let him on board, he sits in the dark for seven years and then sneaks on board the other ship to kill people.I have only really scratched the surface of the many, many, many things wrong with the plot, characterization, physics and devices of this movie, but it is too boring to go on about it any more. Just don't see it, don't believe the other reviews, or you friends or whatever, it's bad, really bad.Sci Fi movies are a bit like murder mysteries. It can be hard to tell if you are watching a good movie or a bad one for a long time, because you are willing to forgive a lot of silliness if the twist at the end is a good one. The twist at the end of Sunshine is not a good one, if Pinbacker climbing on board and trying to kill everyone can be called a twist at all. So it really leaves a sour taste in your mouth.Of the many, many science fiction movies that are better than it, 2001, obviously, and Dark Star, are both vastly superior, but if you want some idiotic space-horror then Event Horizon is worth a look, silly but entertaining and at least the monster doesn't disappoint at every level.Oh, and the storyline of Sunshine is this: A spaceship is sent to drop a nuke into the sun to end a solar winter that has frozen up the earth, threatening humanity, the crew attempt to rescue the previous failed mission but just pick up a scary hitchhiker who kills a bunch of them, and then they drop the bomb and the world is saved but they are all dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Should one avoid exposure to Sunshine or not?ON THE SUNNY SIDE: I always welcome a serious attempt at a high class SF movie. Of course most efforts lead to serious disappointments. But this one has both Alien and 2001 as references. If it delivers at only 10% we would still be treated with the best SF in decades. 28 Weeks Later by Danny Boyle struck me as a very good horror movie. And descent horror movies are as scarce as descent SF movies. Hopes are up.It looks fantastic. Just based on its looks it deserves ten shiny, not dieing, stars.The acting, though not great, was certainly acceptable (apart from the navigator). The beginning doesn't ruin what now can still be hopeful expectations. Though the element of a dark kind of fascination with the sun by the crews psychologist is shown in a really stupid and in your face (lol) manner (exept if to you something like: "yeah, I'm very close to the sun, but waring these cool sunglasses I can take her on" seems in place for a crew member on a mission to prevent this nuclear 'monster' from kicking the bucket).Music by Underworld. Great choice (I am a fan).With this a bright side, what can go wrong? ON THE DARK -LEFT A BIT TOO LONG ON THE BBQ BURNED TO CHARCOAL- SIDE:A whole lot. Actually the whole enterprise.The error of the ships navigator (horribly portrait by an Asian actor who's reinvention of overacting is not worthy of anything but rotten tomatoes) is ridiculous. Hope fades.I don't know if characters need to be developed necessarily, like a lot of comments imply. But it IS needed here that viewers get involved and care for the characters. I don't care how that's realized but Sunshine does the opposite. Maybe Mr Boyle thinks it's cruel to let us care for characters who all get killed. So he let's them do all kinds of stupid things that make us quite indifferent to their fate. And since this group of childish amateurs is the elite crew selected from earths entire population in some future, we don't care a rats ass about that earth as well. Don't take our care for the planet for granted Mr Boyle. All hope is lost.Plot twists get sillier and sillier as the movie progresses, eh sorry, degenerates into a very vague monster (not a joke).Bad acting? I think the actors are not much to blame here. The Script is. It's amazingly bad. Isn't a script a key element in deciding if the making of the movie will go through? Why was this movie made (with this script)? I can't believe the rating here on IMDb is not corrupted. Maybe there are really a lot of people who enjoyed Sunshine, but it would have been so easy to improve on the script. And I hate the flawed clichés like instant freezing in the vacuum(!) of space. Are clichés required for urning a big budget, no matter how flawed? Do flawed clichés get past expert advisors? What deluded arrogance to present this as serious SF. Furthermore the 'science' is degraded by showing too much and leaving too little to imagination. It's OK to introduce techniques that are not explained to the point it can be reputed but do their amazing stuff like in Star Trek. If Sunshine is trying to be more scientifically supported by sharing more of underlying principles it shoots itself in the foot, for even layman can dismiss the science as fantasy lacking enough fantasy. And furthermore, ask yourself this question: If you take a man from earth, expose him to the sun insufficiently protected for seven years, how would he look like? See the answer the makers of Sunshine come up with! Like a walking talking grumpy piece of meat that's badly burned (yeah, right). But wait, maybe I'm astray, lost from Sunshine's ambitious path...Not invited by the movie itself, but by a state of boredom, stubbornly still not fully convinced of Sunshine's dark failure I start to wonder about possible philosophical implications the makers may have intended when abandoning simple movie conventions that enable viewers to see what's in front of the camera and to follow what's going on. How else to blend in a bit of Kubricks' odysseys' depth? Toying a bit with concepts of god, the sun and humankind my goodwill runs out in a last effort to deny that this sun will shine no more. Soon I decide that Sunshine with its vague villain won't score better in this respect than just any movie we look at through some kind of blurring device.Science fiction in my opinion is fiction with a certain level of scientific plausibility. A horror movie just needs to be scary. This movie aims to shine bright in both genres and fails horribly. I suggest, instead of seeing this star killer, to read all the 'hated it' reviews here on IMDb. To me that was a lot more fun. There is however still some attraction in seeing it for its good looks and missed potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunshine, good or bad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's been a lot of debate about whether this movie is good or bad. I liked it at first, but then I started thinking.This movie really just consists of a problem, there's a solution to this problem, however as a result of that solution another problem occurs, this is fine until about the 6th problem or so, and then you just get a headache. If you don't understand me let me break it down, for example (this does happen in the movie) problem: they realize the Icarus 1 is still orbiting around the sun, there is a distress call and the crew of the Icarus 2 believe there could be someone still there, or they could take the bomb from the Icarus one and use it in case their bomb doesn't work to restart the sun. Solution: they change course towards the Icarus 1. Problem: they changed course but didn't fix the sheids (which were set for the normal journey, couldn't the super-genius computer have done this? or simply warned them), the ship might be destroyed if they don't fix the sheilds, a fir occurs in the ship (etc etc) Solution:they fix the sheilds. Problem: the captain loses his life in the mission and all hell breaks loose on the ship between the crew. As you see its as if one thing leads to another, but thats not necessarily a good thing.The whole movie really consists of that. I would describe all the bad things that don't make any sense in this movie but other people have probably named them all. In some peoples defence to this movie they say things like "you should simply watch it without thinking, don't think about its flaws". OK...1. If you didn't think about a movies 'flaws' every movie would be perfect, and none would be bad.2. The movie its self gets you thinking, so who is to blame?A lot of things are left unanswered, for example the captain dies and one of the crew members is like 'captain...what did you see...what did you see?' this really got my interest for a while, until i realized that the captain didn't see anything, or whatever he did see we would never know. The characters seem to change their personality throughout the movie. For example there is one character who seems to have a fetish for plants, half way through the movie she decides to have a change of heart from treehugger to a "lets kill him, he isn't any use to us" sort of person. In the directors defence he did this to show how people could change in different circumstances...OK?....Another idea, when your making a movie stick to one set genre, OK? don't decide, hm...im getting bored of sci fi i think im going to move to horror/thriller. The director must have though 3/4 of the film in, that he'd like to have a crazy killer in the movie. OK i really don't want to explain it all... Its worth watching ONCE, rent it, don't buy it.If you watch it more then once in (for example) a month, then there's something obviously wrong with you, and you should seek counselling.There's nothing really good about the movie, but its still interesting (for a while).Id give it a 4 (maybe 5 if im generous) out of 10.P.S. if the character is close enough to put his hand into the sun and his hand gets burnt, how come the rest of his body doesn't burn as well? This is one of the many unscientific occurings in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I had hopes on this one ? after all a piece of schlock like The Core was at least mildly diverting ? but that hope fizzled out more quickly than the dying sun.Characters seemed intentionally annoying or did I miss some significant developments during the times I nodded out? People have mentioned, often in glowing terms, the soundtrack and the cinematography. The music was sometimes compelling ? though I had trouble with the abrasive song first used over the closing credits: not only was it jarring but also inappropriate to the film's conclusion. The photography, too, had its moments; ultimately, though, technique does not matter when you cannot figure out what is going on, which is what I experienced, especially in the last quarter of the film. It was particularly frustrating not knowing where people were in the ship(s) and whether they were actually dead or not? There was a long segment in which the sole remaining female crew member was?where? doing what? bleeding profusely? re-reading a novel? Intriguing, but too often a bore and largely a waste. So it goes?.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film sucks. Period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, you probably already know about the main plot. Some astronauts are flying to the sun aboard the spaceship Icarus II, in order to "restart" it with a "bomb". Exactly why the sun needs to be "restarted" or why a "bomb" would do it, is not explained. Nor is it explained why they need a manned mission in order to reach the sun. The film contains lots of beautiful pictures of the sun and the ship that adds nothing to the plot. None of the crew is really introduced to us properly, so we don't really care when they die.17 minutes into the film they discover Icarus I circling the sun. The crew decides to investigate it, in order to bring the extra "payload" or "bomb", so they get two chances to "restart" the sun. This decision is of course fatal, but unfortunately for the film, not in any realistic way. It turns out that one of the crew-members of Icarus I is crazy and killed the old crew. After having survived alone for six years, he now continues his work by killing the crew of Icarus II. Gasp! could you find a more boring way of killing this movie? Apart from being crazy, he also lacks skin, and for some reason, every shot that contains him is blurry, either because they spent all their special effects money on pictures of the sun, or because the director was a big fan of the Blair Witch Project, and thought it was a good idea to recreate those fancy shaky-cam effects in a visually beautiful scifi-movie.The crew also faces lots of other dangers, but they are all forced, unlikely incidents that would only happen in a bad movie. There's a faulty manual calculation that makes the "shield" point in the wrong direction, which damages a part of the ship, but no explanation for why the calculation needed to be done manually, or why the computer didn't correct it. There's a fire that starts for no reason, and a sprinkler system that fails for no reason as well. A computer that overheats because it doesn't shut down or go to power-save mode when cooling fails. I could go on, but you get my point...Avoid this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>starts well, but doesn't hold together and has too much gimmickry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine is actually a pretty good movie for the first hour, a slowly paced (U.S. Solaris slow, not original Russian Solaris sloooowwwwww) film that thoughtfully lays out the tensions in a sun-bound spaceship among the crew.The first problem with Sunshine is the decision that makes the whole movie happen. The fact is, no competent captain would a) let a subordinate make the decision (he would ask his opinion, but make the decision himself) and b) risk a carefully calculated mission to try something extremely risky that might not be necessary and could destroy all chances of success.This would never happen. The only spaceship captain who would do something this moronic would be Zap Brannigan from Futurama. So even though the movie continued to be absorbing, that really kept nagging at me.The second major problem is the hackneyed, unconvincing plot twist, which is bad both in script and in execution. First off, it's kind of ridiculously that this crazy guy, seriously burned, survived and was then able to sneak from one ship to another. But even if you accept that, it is bizarre to see what has basically been a low-key drama about committed people dealing with a difficult, life-or-death situation become a horror movie with a creepy Freddie Kruger-type guy killing everyone.To make it worse, Boyle chooses the really bizarre tactic of making the bad guy hard to see. First he is seen on a corrupted video, which at least is possible, but once he's on the ship, his image is always blurred. Why? It's as though he is supposed to be a ghost or a figment of the crew's imagination, but nothing in the movie besides the blurring out of the bad guy would support that theory. So they just are trying to do what Alien did and show less to scare you more. Only it doesn't work, it just seems weird and annoying.This isn't the only place in which the direction makes things unclear, but this is probably the main place where it's done on purpose.There are effective scenes in the movie. In fact, most of the first hour is pretty effective. And some suspense is generated in the poorly conceived latter part of the film. The cast is rather generic but decent.The film gets its conflict from a bad decision by the crew. The film fails because of bad decisions behind the camera.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the past the world has chosen space flight crews from military pilots, scientists or civilian engineers of the highest maturity and experience. People that were selected for remaining cool under the worst circumstances and would "continue the mission" no matter how difficult it became..."Sunshine" is what would happen if you chose the crew from anxiety ridden film school grad students.They run around in a dither from the start making silly mistakes left and right. But, they look very soulful the whole time and aren't afraid to burst into tears at the slightest provocation. Appropriate behavior for an acting class but not for life-or-death missions.I think this is truly why the first Icarus mission failed. A soufflé' fell and the crew hyperventilated to death. On the good side, the creators manage to get a tremendous amount of visual beauty on the screen for a comparatively small budget.As one crew member says "I don't know how to do it, just do it". This seems to have been the main directive for creating the movie. With regard to some of the super-positive reviews...No, this is not one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever. If you were so stoned that you couldn't follow a plot anyway, you might really enjoy yourself. Then again, if you were that stoned, you'd probably enjoy cleaning the basement.This is one where the visuals and music stand out, in a big way but, the characters and the story fall short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>contains tad bit of spoilers:The movie simply could've done better without its imitation of zombie horror flicks. It seemed intrusive in a reasonably well-oriented, humanistic, and somewhat philosophical sci-fi film. The film is not based on the most acute logic or common sense that's true, and certain parts of the scenario just seem plain unreasonable, so probably everyone in the audience can find something in the film to disagree with. However, the movie presents and paces itself quite nicely, giving a good focus on "human beings" in sci-fi situations rather than just the gizmos and techno-saviness. Sunshine really is a mix of a lot of things, and I believe everyone will be able to find something they hate and something they love in it. As an example, I enjoyed the movie as one that portrays different people being placed in extreme situations, with fantastic and beautiful settings, but not without distasteful zombie chase scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some nice visuals but a muddled plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Boyle's film aspires to '2001'-like transcendence but ultimately disappoints with a confusing final third and some too-gimmicky direction.It's not just that the fairly linear, science-driven plot abruptly shifts into a horror flick scenario -- this might've still provided an appropriately tense, countdown-to-zero finale. But Boyle unwisely overlays the action with such blurry cinematography and choppy editing that it becomes virtually impossible to follow.The cast is fine, doing their best with underwritten roles, but it would also have been helpful if screenwriter Alex Garland had provided a bit more back story, e.g., why is the sun expiring, how were the two solar expeditions put together, what has life become like back on earth, etc.Also -- and this may seem like a minor complaint to some -- if you're taking pains to be scientifically accurate, and indeed, deliberately following in the footsteps of Kubrick and Clarke, it would behoove you to give an explanation for the ship's artificial gravity. I've read that earlier concepts included a centrifuge section, or alternately, that the bomb's payload was so massive it provided adequate gravitational pull, but neither is mentioned. Disappointingly, then, 40 years of advancing space technology and knowledge have not led to better VFX or increased verisimilitude.The filmmakers' efforts here are appreciated, but it's a shame they fall short of the mark.</fullReview>

No effects, no plot, no tension, nothing at all. Factual errors abound, make- up, cast choice, acting are horrible separately and worse still combined. I decided to cancel my Netflix membership after this movie, since it was given about 3 stars out of 5 in Netflix, whereas it deserves 1 if not 0. I cannot even find 10 lines to write about this movie, but it not worth wasting the time to write 10 lines...

		<fullReview>Films do not have to be state of the art realistic to be fun and enjoyable but they need to know what they are. Sunshine sold it's self as a realistic attempt of space flight in the future with a big foot inside real science. There's just a handful of film that go that extra steps for believability and sunshine takes 3 steps backward. There are just some ridiculous elements to this film that just would not happen in reality.You have one last shot of saving the world and instead of creating redundancy in your crew for the key critical skills, you bring on board a psychologist, just a stone throw away from the starship enterprise next generation feel good counsellor. In reality all these people would have been thoroughly tested and profiled on the ground before they went up and any spare spaces would have been taken up with pilots or engineers or perhaps a doctor!! I'm just highlighting one of many flaws in this film. IN certain films this may not matter but when the director is trying to place into a realistic universe these things just standout like sore thumbs. But these kind of oversights are not the fundamental flaw in the film they are merely the symptoms.This film suffers from a terrible case Schizophrenia the director never able to make his mind up of what kind if film he's trying to make so instead he's makes about 5 types of film in one and ruins all possibilities of this ending up an OK film. The premise is good, the visuals stunning, the cast high quality but the plot is all over the place. He jumps from 2001 to event horizon, to even the dreaded back hole!! With generous helpings of the terrible Mission to Mars? Good idea, shame the director couldn't make his mind of the type film he was making. .</fullReview>

A take-your-breath-away opening and realism that just blew my mind. This was not a film relying on just acting; these actors put their selves there to the point where you forgot it was a film. Especially the one and the only (my favorite) Mr. Cillian Murphy who brought his character Capa to such a depth and life. And not to mention a soundtrack that was not only haunting but subtly hopeful. I am not overreacting when I say this is definitely one everyone should see if they are a fan of classic Sci-Fi. Don't bring any expectations of classic films though, but just enjoy it for what it is and you may be very satisfied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally watched it and found it not that bad but it does not make a good science-fiction movie. The story shows eight astronauts going to the Sun to destroy a strange matter so as to restore the Sun's natural state. It seems simple but they face a lot of difficulties as they are in space, they can't move freely in space. Some problems like not enough oxygen for the whole crew. The director of 28 days later went down from his zombie movie and made this science-fiction movie, which is like more or less the same violence, the bloody violence and it looks like more of a slasher movie than a science-fiction movie. That is what it went wrong, the director focuses on the violence and the other parts are not good, the first half of the movie shows the crew helping to restore or planning how to restore and then it comes to the other half where you see blood, the slasher, people wanting to kill people because they felt that he betrayed them. It is felt that the story is rushing through. The director should at least put the talking follow by some action, just like other science-fiction movies. If you have the DVD then you might as well fast-forward the talking and see the action.It is not a bad film, it is just that it does no live up to the expectation of its genre. It starts with talking and then suddenly in the last part of it, you see blood. It does not mix well. It has meanings. Who knows, in future, we will have to go to the Sun, destroying something that is blocking it. It makes a good movie in cinemas, you can feel the suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sigh.... What A Waste Of Great Efforts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I can say is: Frustratingly Disappointing.Don't get me wrong. Everything was great. Thought I did not appreciate a few extra snippets of just watching the ship float around in space.Plot: It's very far in the future. The sun is dying. If sun dies, we die. Plan is: Send out astronauts up and blast the sun into a million pieces. The rationale is that if the big star becomes a gazillion tiny stars, it'll increase the sun's, or rather the suns' surface areas and thereby increasing light and heat. Result: Earth is saved. So the ship Icarus 2 is sent up with a crew of 7 is sent up to deliver the 'Payload' aka Bomb. The twist is, there was a previously an Icarus 1 sent up and never returned. No one knows the reason for failure in mission.The entire movie was a success for a number of reasons. A mission to salvage a catastrophe is always exciting to watch. I like the development of the characters. The human and emotional factors. It's human to err. And they did. The decision to check Icarus 1 out cost pretty much every crew member's life. One of the astronauts made a careless mistake in forgetting to calculate the deflection of the sun's rays should they change course and from there, everything went wrong. The technology in that spaceship was so cool. They had an Earth Room in which whenever someone needs to feel calm and at home, they go into this stimulated room where they can choose to be say by the beach or in a rain forest or anything else earthly... There's also a Green Room that recycles and purifies the air and supplies them with oxygen and food. Everything in that place makes it possible for them to provide for themselves for years... Maybe even forever if nothing goes wrong. There's also this shield on the outside of the ship which deflects the sun's rays and heat away from the ship. A little hard for me to believe that they can ever find a material which can withstand the ridiculously hot sun. Still, it's a film set in the future. Hence, there's so much that we can assume and accept. It's precisely because of the high ex of assumptions and imagination the movie allowed that caused me to be really upset about the reason for Icarus 1's failure.The reason? The captain of Icarus 1 went bonkers. Yah! He did. He turned into some half burnt looney Bean and killed his entire crew. Cos he believed that God should not be challenged and that they were all just mere stardust. Hence he abandoned the mission and killed everyone and waited for the next Icarus to come so that he can kill them all too. And he pretty much nearly succeeded. Only thing is, Kappa, the Physicists, managed to deliver the payload and save the Earth.With all the reasons you can ever make up, you choose to make the Captain of Icarus 1 crazy?! For God's sake!!!! It's almost a sci-fi movie already! Give us something more intelligent will ya! Shucks man. It was such a greaat movie. Until they made someone crazy. Dammit.It had such potential. The movie had one flaw. But one flaw that was sooooo in-your-face in just ruined everything.For that, I give the movie 4 /10. If they came up with a better reason for Icarus 1's failure, I'd have given the movie an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Sunshine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Danny Boyle's movies, though I've watched only but a handful of his movies - Trainspotting, A Life Less Ordinary, The Beach, 28 Days Later and Millions. Teaming up with Alex Garland, who wrote the novel The Beach, and the story for 28 Days Later, they team up again for this futuristic science fiction thriller, where a group of astronauts and scientist, aboard Earth's last hope for salvation - the Icarus II, in an attempt to deliver a "payload" of nukes to the Sun's core, to reignite our solar star and bring warmth back to a freezing Earth.From the onset where the Fox Searchlight logo makes way to the horizon where the sun peeks over valley and mountains, Sunshine wastes no time in establishing our crew of 8 - Capa (Cillian Murphy from 28 Days Later) the physicist, the MVP crew member who knows how to activate the bomb, which makes him not only valuable, but provided a minor plot hole quibble about this indispensability, Mace the engineer, played by Chris Evans, in a major departure from his usual jock roles in Cellular and Fantastic Four, Corazon (Michelle Yeoh) the botanist, in charge of the agriculture, hydroponic food and eco-garden to provide oxygen on board, Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada, whom I last saw in the dismal The Promise) as the Captain, Cassie (Rose Byrne) the pilot of the Icarus II, Searle (Cliff Curtis) the doctor, Harvey (Troy Garity) the communications officer who finds his value dip when his equipment got fried, and Trey (Benedict Wong) the navigator whose "to err is human" shakes up the entire movie.It does seem like the jolly crew of the Enterprise really boldly going where no man has gone before, doesn't it? Even the Icarus II has a dish like structure for its payload and a separable capsule for its crew quarters. Nonetheless as you sit through the movie, it does bring shades of movie like 2001: A Space Odyssey for its intelligent HAL-like onboard computer, Star Trek for its crew structure and space walks, Alien for its dark, dank claustrophobic spaceship corridors, and even the all-out action USofA ra-ra movie Armageddon for its nuke mission. However, Sunshine stems its own signature in the crowded field of space mission movies, and quite superficially though, made it a mixture of men and women in a potentially suicidal mission to save mankind from doom, and a multi-cultural/racial crew, as compared to Armageddon's team of redneck jocks.Danny Boyle managed to combined most of the good stuff from those movies, in a sort of adoption of best practices, and weaved in a moving drama about sacrificing for the greater good or for the objective, the perennial morality versus mortality question, and that of self- preservation. It's easy to make it the usual run off the mill movie combining action horror and mystery, but Boyle fused them all together with his distinct style, making Sunshine engaging at every level, be it the set action sequences to keep you at the edge of your seat, or cringe at the unknown horror kept under wraps for the most part, or be quizzical at the mystery as it unfolds. Although the development of team dynamics do seem choppy, there were instances where you can identify cliques and survivor styled alliances. I thought perhaps an extended DVD version will be able to put this aspect of characterization right.The movie's pace is measured and kept tight and tense, leaving no room for idle development though. You might expect certain outcome with regards to the set action pieces, but somehow, you don't feel like trying to guess who'll survive and who'll not. In fact, chances are you're likely to cling onto every sliver of hope that the crew will survive every ordeal thrown at them, and boy, do they get quite a number of challenges to deal with, each of them distinct, different, and likely to keep you engaged as it develops, formulaic or otherwise. Some though, might make you cry.There are plentiful CG effects, most of which are the beautifully stunning Sun images, as well as nifty effects works of the consequences of space travel. There's a nice end credits sequence which almost summarizes the entire movie, giving you an opportunity to relive some of the key scenes again. Accompanied by a great track called "The Avenue of Hope", I was left curious though that the song was also subtitled (in Mandarin) as it played.Sunshine's strengths lie in its ability to release a leash of familiarity, and then reeling you in with a refreshing take on things expected to happen. It's one of the more accessible science fiction movie to date, which doesn't go all too preachy with the supposed messages it's trying to put across. You can watch and enjoy it at face value, or go bonkers debating over the philosophy behind the decisions undertaken by the crew. Sunshine is excellent - two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, derivative, disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2001, Alien, Blade Runner: These 3 films are like the fundamental elements of the sci-fi periodic table. Over the years they've been recombined, reconfigured and reproduced in countless sci-fi movies, none of which, I'm sorry to say, has ever managed to surpass or even add to them in any substantial way. Sunshine is no exception. Other than its eponymous premise - a mission to reignite the dying sun - pretty much every element of this film can be traced back either to the above three, or to other, less worthy examples of the genre. To make matters worse, the plot is suddenly abandoned halfway through the film to make way for a senseless and unoriginal haunted spaceship/horror subplot - involving the crew being picked off one by one by the half-barbecued captain of the previous, lost mission - a subplot that, since none of it is explained in the slightest way, completely fails to create tension or be frightening. The style of the movie is equally irritating: clearly contrived to appeal to a young, hip demographic, not one of these "astronauts" appears to be over 30 years old, and look more like fashion models than the crew of a spaceship (thin, shiny and androgynous), such that for the first few minutes, you're not sure if you're watching a film or just a really high-budget Calvin Klein commercial. This only serves to undermine the serious theme of self-sacrifice that underlies the movie, as it's hard to believe that these representatives of the ultra-shallow, "Trainspotting" generation would give up their I-pod, let alone their lives to save the earth... Summary: Looks really cool, would have made a great five-minute music video. Another pointless contribution to the sci-fi pool. Still waiting for the next great one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film a few days ago and feel very disappointed, I tried to go in open minded, given that I liked previous work by Danny Boyle however I felt truly let down. I had the unfortunate experience of watching First Contact a few years ago, and sitting through that film thinking surely it gets better, unfortunately like that sunshine does not.Although there are some good attempts at suspense, you feel some how you have seen it before, with the echoes of films like event horizon. If you watch it you will see what I mean.It does not leave you with the feeling you have seen something new, but that you have seen something old and nameless, and wondering where you saw that idea before. But it is not 1 dea it is many previous ideas rolled into 1. unfortunatelyThe actors and direct have to make do their best with this situation, and try their best, some very good performances are given and some of the cinematography is excellent, it is a shame that the story is so lacking in material. Although I will admit. It is always easier to criticize than create</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've Rarely Seen a Movie So Utterly Ruined by Its Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sunshine" is an hour of pretty good movie completely ruined by a disastrously terrible final 30 minutes.Danny Boyle's latest exercise in feel-bad cinema finds a crew of astronauts on their way to launch a mega-bomb at Earth's dying sun, hoping to revive it and save the fate of humanity. They're the second crew to attempt this feat; no one knows what happened to the first crew other than that they didn't succeed in their mission. Cillian Murpy of the other-worldly eyes plays Capa, the crew's physicist and only one who knows how to actually launch the bomb itself. Chris Evans is Mace, the crew's hyper-male maintenance guy. Michelle Yeoh cares tenderly for the ship's oxygen garden, which needs to provide the crew members with enough oxygen to get them to the sun and back. There are other crew members, like a stoic captain, a psych officer who's obsessed with staring at the sun, and a sensitive female, but really none of the characters ever amount to much and they're all virtually interchangeable. This wasn't especially troublesome to me, because I don't expect strong characterizations in movies like this, and also because the science fiction element of the film's first half is interesting enough to stand on its own. Boyle creates a feeling of impending dread; we know something bad is going to happen, and there's a squirmy but not unpleasant sense of tension in waiting to find out what that something is going to be.All of this opening action is reminiscent of "2001: A Space Odyssey." Boyle focuses on the silence and oppression of space, and the claustrophobia of space life. But when the crew accidentally locates the spaceship sent out on the first mission and boards it in search of clues of what happened, the film switches into "Alien" mode and things get noticeably more jumpy. Even though I had no idea where this movie was going, I was willing to go along for the ride, and was even enjoying the unpredictability. Then, about half an hour from the end, the screenplay veers into ludicrous, shlocky slasher-film horror, and the utter awfulness of the movie's remainder completely canceled out anything good that came out of its early half.I'm repeatedly amazed at Boyle's inability to NOT royally screw up every movie he makes. I don't know what he was thinking here. This movie's screenplay is a disaster, and it's clear he had no idea what kind of movie he wanted to make. It's like he wanted a little bit of everything, but instead of forcing himself to pick and choose, he tries to include it all. By the time the credits role, this movie has lapsed into near incomprehensibility.It's a shame, because this movie had some original things going for it, and Boyle does know how to put haunting images on screen. But what I ultimately felt like I got for my ten dollars was a montage of rejected scenes from every other sci-fi/horror film produced up to now.Grade: D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good premise gone terrible terribly wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched the movie Sunshine and it was the worst thing I have seen in a very long time. It ended nearly an hour ago and I'm still creeped out by all the violence in the film, but the violence was not what made it bad. The premise-the sun is dying and we must send a bomb to it to send it--is okay. It kind of reminded me of Firefly. And then the movie proceeded to fail at every possible opportunity to redeem itself. We see Icarus I--let's go save people: good plot twist. All the people burned themselves. Burned themselves? Okay, that's kind of interesting. LETS NOT SPEND ANY TIME ON THIS INTERESTING PART. The ship is completely intact. But someone is sabotaging it and we can't move. And this someone has been TALKING TO GOD FOR SEVEN YEARS. BUT we don't learn about this conversation with god. We only know that GOD apparently told this guy to kill everyone.Had the dialog at least been slightly good, that might of been okay. If the movie had had any discussion of anything interesting, that would have made it okay. It had the potential not to suck, and it blew it. References to Greek mythology and literary quotations are not substitutes for good dialog. This movie was very very very very bad. I don't understand how anyone could have thought it was a good idea to make a film turn out the way this one did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>waste of space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an insult to your intelligence. It is one of those movies where the whole plot is forced onward through the most implausible and plain stupid settings and turns of events. Let me draw you a picture:- The crew: young, inexperienced, insecure, paranoid and highly unprofessional in about everything they do. You don't put people like that on a mission that the survival of the entire earth depends on.- Protocol: everything they do seems do be improvisation. Which is why everything goes wrong. These people were not trained to stick to their mission no matter what (and they behave quite the contrary). And while planes and space-ships are usually piloted by several pilots who have excessive protocols for navigation which they have been trained to use for years; here there is just one (rather nervous) pilot without any such protocol and who obviously hasn't gone through any sort of simulation either. It's like they went: "so what's your job?" "I'm a janitor" "good, you pilot this space-ship on which the whole of man-kind depends"- Common sense: no one seems to have it. They all make the worse kinds of decisions all the time. I don't want to give any spoilers (in case you insist on seeing this flick), but think of it like this: "hey, there is a piece of paper on the middle of the road, let me just go and pick it up in case there is something to read on it, without paying any attention to the truck that is heading my way at bone-crushing speeds"Lets not even mention the highly advanced on-board AI that seems oblivious to anything that goes on on the ship until it's too late. Thats like sitting next to a driver that keeps talking to you while looking at you instead of the road.Seriously, what a lame waste of space.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Danny Boyle's "Shallow Grave" I thought there was a Polanskian, Hitchcockian, Chabrolian creature trying to come out. I was wrong - it happens more often than not - but Danny is moving away from me or I from him, in any case we're like strangers now. What made me love "Shallow Grave" were the characters and the way he introduced them to us. I felt involved, totally involved. In "Sunshine" the detachment was such that I couldn't even follow. Impressive, virtuoso film-making to be sure but cold an impersonal. I could watch Cillian Murphy's face for hours without getting bored but I got bored looking at his face because I didn't have a clue who he was and after a while, I didn't care. Mr Boyle, go back to graves, human graves, earth graves, please, do it for me.</fullReview>

If your** looking for logic, look elsewhere! The sun is dying and we want to nuke it...really? Nuking the sun with a bomb 10 to the power of 89 times the biggest bomb we now possess, it will not be enough to scrape some paint off of it. Its*** like me shooting the Great Pyramid of Giza with my puny pellet gun and expect it to fall down. And a bomb the size of Manhattan? Remind me again how much money it costs to slingshot 50 grams of material into space! There is a reason astronauts drink there**** own urine.Now let's look at the crew...laughable. We have the androgynous weakling with emotional problems who is responsible to save us all...god save us. We have a bunch of morons with psychological problems who behave like high school airheads, yeah right, methinks we need a better screening process, as these guys aren't qualified to clean bathrooms let alone save humanity.And there is still more idiocy. The movie suddenly turns into some supernatural horror fantasy crap because we are in space and almost every other movie set in space in the last 65 years is supposed to have a monster in it.*Intentional error **Intentional error ***Intentional error ****Intentional errorExplanation for the intentional mistakes: morons make these same mistakes so many times that I have come to the conclusion that they should be intentional.

		<shortDescription>A Great Idea with a Disjointed Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate writing bad reviews, and I don't do it often, but "Sunshine" just flat Stinks.I like the idea of going to the Sun on a huge ship that will take a long time to get there, with a relatively small crew, and no Transporters or Photon Torpedoes. Finally, some real science fiction.The first hour or so is pretty decent, but then the plot just falls apart. There was plenty of talent available... Michelle Yeoh, Cillian Murphy, Chris Evans, and Rose Byrne... But you could tell by the lackluster acting that they all knew the movie was going to be a dud.Every dramatic moment in the film seems to be contrived and unexplained. 1) A guy makes a big mistake and somebody dies trying to fix it. Then the guy just goes completely nuts and commits suicide? That just seems incredibly overblown to me. We're talking about professionals who have been selected to save mankind, but it seems like what we got are emotionally immature teenagers.2) The other guy that dies in #1, above, seems to do so with complete emotional detachment from the situation. That doesn't seem too realistic, either.3) The Chris Evans character is the only one who seems to understand that humanity is facing certain extinction if the mission is not completed. Halfway through the movie, I was wondering what kind of hiring criteria the International Space Program has these days. It seems like most of the characters took a correspondence course and applied for the job via email.4) Why in the world would the crew of Icarus II even consider going after Icarus I? I could see that in another scenario, but when the fate of the entire Human species is depending on this mission, Icarus I is just out of luck. The one guy says that Two chances are better than One... Why? If it's because the use of the "Stellar Bomb" is a theoretical idea, then guess what? If the theory is wrong, Two shots aren't going to help you -- you could have One Million bombs, and it still wouldn't work. It either works or it doesn't.5) Then, with no explanation as to why he went crazy, the crew of Icarus II encounters "Psycho Captain." I can get that the audience is supposed to make their own decision as to why he went crazy, and why he does what he does, but then the whole subplot of "Psycho Captain" just becomes irrelevant anyway. He's just staring at the guy while he makes sure that the bomb is detonated. In the end, his only purpose was to serve as the "Monster", purely for the sake of manufactured drama.All I have left to say is... The next time you want to make a science-fiction thriller... Pick a plot, and stick with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Silly, Entertaining Sci-Fi Jelly Bean That's Narrow But Unpredictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set roughly a generation from the present day, a small crew of astronauts are charged with the salvation of mankind when the sun begins to flicker out. Naturally, the most human response is to fly an absurdly large bomb into it, light that wick and come home to universal adoration. Of course, there's also the nagging problem of the first expedition (transparently dubbed the "Icarus I") which dipped off the radar on its own, identical, mission a few years prior. It's a perfectly preposterous, semi-serious bit of science fiction silliness that veers into dark-screen slasher material in the final act. Very similar to Event Horizon, come to think of it, minus the demons. Most of the fun comes from establishing the concept, when we're free to play around with loose science and appreciate the nuances of the futurist industrial design. The later developments seem a little obvious and manufactured, and the crew is bafflingly awful at basic decision-making once they're past the reach of Earthbound communication, so there's also plenty to groan and roll eyes about. Lots of familiar faces floundering around on this vessel, though - Chris Evans, Michelle Yeoh, Cillian Murphy, Rose Byrne - not that they bring more than bravado to the equation. It's kind of amazing that this is the way Danny Boyle preceded Slumdog Millionaire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danny Boyle Delivers Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although there are some titles similar to this, such as Armageddon and The Core, this film was on a whole other level than those two. Directed by Danny Boyle, who always delivers, this is a movie about a small crew sent to reignite the sun with a massive bomb. The performances from all of the actors are great, and I loved the cinematography. The tension in some of the scenes was extremely high, my heart pounding all throughout. Yes, the third act kind of falls out of place, but still provides an exciting and thought provoking conclusion.I have bought this film on DVD, because I'm sure I will watch it again. This is the type of movie that makes you think, and is very powerful in some scenes. If you want an intense, visually stunning thriller, than Sunshine is the way to go. Thitype of movie that makes you think, and is very powerful in some scenes. You may not agree with me, but I'm sure you will enjoy at least your first viewing, I highly recommend it. This film comes into a list of my favourite sci fi films along with Moon, District 9, Aliens and more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunshine is one of those movies that you watch not expecting something amazing but it's brilliance will sneak up on you. The premise does it's job in setting up the environment and mood for the rest of the movie.First of all the visual effects for this movie are beautiful, it's like a once in a life time look into the beauty of the universe. The acting in the movie while isn't amazing do their job well and have a great tension between each other and playing of their emotions.However, as with every review of this movie there has to be an acknowledgment of the third act. How much does it detract from the overall movie? In my opinion while the third act is inferior to the first two it is not enough to stop me from giving Sunshine a 10/10.Sunshine is the only movie I have watched that has left me in awe when it finished. I sat in my chair for over 10 minutes after the credits just processing what I had just witnessed. But this is also a sci-fi movie and should be treated as such.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Sci-Fi film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Boyle has dabbled his hand in sci-fi here, and whilst we swears he'll never return to it, its a genre he clearly has a knack for. Here, he has delivered a superbly paced, well acted and beautifully shot film that keeps you engrossed for the entire run time.The plot line is relatively straight forward, and like any good science fiction, it is backed up by sound science knowledge (perhaps with a few "artistic" flairs added). 8 scientists are to deliver a nuclear bomb to the sun, which is dying, failing to heat the Earth and threatening mankind. They are on board the Icarus II, the second attempt at delivering the "payload" after the failure of the first mission, the Icarus I, where they will fly as close to the sun as possible, detach the bomb and send it on its way into the heart of our nearest star, and then return to Earth.After flying past Mercury, however, they pick up the distress signal of the Icarus I, which has been missing for the past 7 years. This sets off a chain of events that put in jeopardy the mission, the lives of the crew, and humanity back on earth.It is superbly acted, and special mention should go to Chris Evans, who throws off his "nothing but good looks" tag and delivers a fine performance as the military-minded engineer who places the success of the mission above all else. Cillian Murphy works well as the nuclear physicist who's responsible for ensuring the payload is delivered properly, but sometimes struggles with the weight of responsibility that his job attaches itself to. There are also great supporting roles by Rose Byrne, Cliff Curtis and Mark Strong.But the true standout in this film is Danny Boyle, his cinematography and special effects team. The scenes involving the spacecraft, both internal and external, always look great, and the sun almost feels like a character in itself: ominous, deadly, and crucial to the films plot line. In typical Boyle fashion, he plays with his editing and effects to stimulate a scene beyond a normal "point the camera" effort, and especially in the tense and nervy scenes, his "single frame splicing" and distortion effects work really well to rack up the tension.If your into your sci-fi, this is a definite film to watch. But don't get thrown off by the sci-fi tag if that's not your thing, because this also plays out like a drama as well, with the interactions of the characters and their responses to their world as interesting as the science premise of the film.It's just really a shame that Boyle won't return to this field. If this is anything to go by, the genre would welcome him back!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sunshine" didn't work for me very well.1. The basic idea of the movie/MacGuffin was unrealistic and this was pretty obvious to me since I know a little bit about astronomy and physics.* The first premise of the movie is that the sun is dying/losing power/going dark. Science knows a lot about our sun. The sun will die out in about 5 billion years. And no special object could make it lose brightness. The Wikipedia "Sunshine" article discusses this.* The second basic premise in the film is that; if the sun was "dying", that the people on earth could do something about it. No bomb that could be carried by a spaceship (even one with the mass of Manhattan) would be able to reignite the sun.3. The goal of the characters was predictable. They are trying to save life on Earth. It was pretty obvious to me that the movie would not have a depressing ending. So, I knew how the film was going to end after hearing the introduction. 4. A predictable movie isn't a bad thing if the interaction with the characters is interesting. But several of the actors in "Sunshine" were not that convincing.First we have the captain, Kaneda, played by Hiroyuki Sanada. This was a very important role. But Sanada's English was not very good and that limited his performance.Cliff Curtis as Searle and Troy Garity as Harvey were not memorable. And this set up another predictable plot point.5. I knew who was going to die. In the movie some of the crew members need to be sacrificed. It became clear to me that the less effective actors were going to go. And they did. The only exception to this was Trey played by Benedict Wong. He had some good moments but since he caused a major catastrophe, I knew that Trey was also going to die. 6. "Sunshine" at the end turned into a slasher film because a crazy character entered the story. It was not very interesting or scary to me. Frankly, by this time I was ready for the movie to be over.** What did I like? The photography and editing stand out as being pretty creative. There was lots of movement with the camera and there was quick editing with pictures of crew members. It felt pretty fresh. The sets and special effects of the sun and the ship were well done.There were also a few moments in the movie that I really enjoyed; a quiet chat between Robert Capa (Cillian Murphy) and Cassie (Rose Byrne); crew members exploring another ship; and the despair of Trey.** "Sunshine" is interesting to look at but it doesn't have much more beyond that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone has their favorite Donny Boyle film, and this is probably mine. A profound science fiction masterpiece that is unapologetically equal parts mystical tone poem, existential crisis, spiritual pilgrimage, and cultural allegory, it's also one of the few films that might provide a genuine meditative experience on a rainy afternoon. It's also one of the supreme "solar films," abounding in locations that are utterly haunting in their gamma ray infused, ruinous beauty. (Unfortunately, they also may have contributed to the lung cancer contracted by many of the film's main personnel years later.) Boyle had to film this movie twice due to the lab destroying his original footage, and every frame seems ripped from his soul. The harsh sepia that blankets the first 20 or so minutes of the film, and the strange collage-like effect that is created by it, is simply marvelous. I actually watched this part of the film three times. Boyle is truly a master of the "scene"; he creates ponderously slow moving photographs. But the visuals are not his only concern. Every single sound in this film is crystal clear, and not a single one is wasted or out of place. And these sounds weave in and out of the dialogue, the soundtrack, a very modern feeling one it should be noted, flawlessly. I don't mind a movie that challenges me or makes me think, and I have to admit that Sunshine has some haunting visuals, but I'm sure if I stared at static for 3 hours I could pick out some interesting moments as well. At some point a film is just a blank canvas, asking the viewers to invent meaning and substance. If you're prepared to do that, have at it. It's not what I look for in a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than I ever expected it to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie because I know that my brother loves hard sci-fi so I decided to take him to see it. I know this because when we would go to the video shop, he would sometimes pick movies about a small group of people who go off to save the world (The Core is an example of this type of movie). So, when I saw the trailer for this film, I though he might like it. Personally I wasn't expecting much, and when I watched this film again, it did remind me in parts of 2001 A Space Odyssey, however this film is 1000 times better (I hated 2001).When I discovered that Danny Boyle directed the film, I was even more intrigued, particularly since his efforts on 28 Days Later was extraordinary, and in this film the same camera techniques are used, though it can be a little difficult to understand what is going on. This is one of those films that it can be confusing while watching it, but the more that you watch and dig into it, the more you come to understand what is going on.The story is that the sun is dying, and it is because of something called a Q-Ball. This is a large chunk of matter caught in the sun which affects its ability to produce heat and energy. A craft, loaded with the biggest nuke imaginable, was sent to the sun to destroy the Q-Ball, however it simply vanished, so with time working against them, the people of Earth collected the rest of their fissionable material to attempt one last go at reigniting the sun.This film is one of those space horrors, and if done right (as was done in this case) it can be very good. Event Horizon was good, but nowhere near as good as this. The horror is two-fold, being trapped, alone, out of communication from the rest of humanity. There is the horror of how one minor mistake can bring the mission to the edge of failure, and there is the horror of knowing that it is because of this mission that Earth may be saved, and failure is not an option.Then there are the spiritual aspects of this film, in that the Sun is more than just a ball of fire, but a living entity. We see this in both of the captains, who become so transfixed by the sun that they pretty much go made. The captain to the Icarus II sacrifices himself, knowing that he is descending into madness. Then there is the captain of the Icarus I, who has survived six years, and has become so totally obsessed with the spirituality of the sun, that he must go out of his way to stop the bomb from exploding.Finally, there is the one man who can detonate the bomb. There are only nine real characters in this film, and as everybody dies off, it leaves us with the main protagonist, and in this film, it is this guy. The question is, does he actually die. It is suggested in the film that he does not, but rather ends up being caught in a time flux which leaves him trapped in the sun for eternity, and while it is eternity to him, it is a flash of a second to the rest of us. We can see the end coming this way with his dreams of falling into the sun. It is as if a part of his destiny is to become one with the sun.</fullReview>

It turned a clichéd, "Time to save the world" movie into a thrilling psychological horror film with deep messages on philosophy and religion.While I was watching the film, I never quite knew who was crazy and who wasn't, and I constantly had to change my mind. The perfect psychological horror film has you guessing from beginning to end. I loved how there is no clear way to look at this movie. Even now, years after its' release, people have different opinions on it.The film is beautifully executed, from the amazing sets to the subtle directorial efforts.(Flash frames of the crew of the Icarus 1: Nice!) The ending is one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen in a film. Sunshine is by far one of the best, most well executed movies ever made.</fullReview>

Mankind's final hope of salvation from a dying sun is in the hand's of the crew members of the Icarus 2.This movie has a great pace that never slows down once its starts to accelerate, and to me pace is the most important thing in entertainment. It never wastes time on boring scenes - everything is important and plays to the main storyline.The acting was great. There's a little twist near the end that might be unexplainable to some, but I figured it out. The directing is wonderful, as is the soundtrack - though it might have used another 1-2 songs, the major overture played during every riveting scene (which is the only reason I gave it 9 instead of 10).I also enjoy how the movie doesn't try to explain anything to you. It lets you figure it all out on your own while following a very straightforward storyline.Great movie, I'm glad I happened upon it. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HOTTEST Sci-fi Movie I've Seen :-)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most cinematically-satisfying science fiction movies I've seen :) It sure has all the gripping ingredients - cool special effects, loads &amp; loads of suspense, twists, evil, honor....Every actor brought sincerity &amp; belief into their characters - Cillian Murphy as Robert Capa, Chris Evans as Mace, action superstar Michelle Yeoh as Corazon, the beautiful Rose Byrne as Cassie, Hiroyuki Sanada as Kaneda, Troy Garity as Harvey and Benedict Wong as Trey. All of them were equally good.The effects especially are beautiful. The visuals of the sun were quite eery yet breathtaking.I'm not a science geek so I cannot say for all the technicalities of the plot or any plot-holes for that matter. Although, I wished the end showing the Sun's effect on Earth could have been more visually dramatic but it was still very good.Director Danny Boyle has done an excellent job. But maybe a Ridley Scott or James Cameron would have kicked a** :) Verdict: Super cool or should I say supernova hot sci-fi thriller :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danny Boyle directs "Sunshine", a generic science fiction tale about a crew of astronauts tasked with delivering a nuclear bomb to the heart of Earth's dying sun.The film blends three scifi sub-genres. We have the "Armageddon" styled "save the earth" sacrificial bombing mission ("Armageddon", "Deep Impact", "The Core", "Meteor", "Space Cowboys" etc), followed by a generic "search the abandoned ship" subplot ("Sphere", "Event Horizon", "Lost In Space", "Alien", "Icarus XB1", "The Abyss" etc), followed by a ridiculous "haunted house in space" climax which borrows liberally from such scifi and slasher movies as "Alien", "Halloween", "The Thing" etc.A good cast can sell anything, but "Sunshine's" cast members are far too young. Rather than trained astronauts, they react to stress, solve problems and interact with one another like glitzy soap opera stars.The film's visuals and spaceships have wowed some audience members, but hardcore scifi fans will be familiar with the umbrella shaped shieldship at the heart of the picture, such a design popping up in countless classic scifi novels, comics and even TV shows like "Star Trek" and the expanded universe of "Star Wars". I'm not sure exactly where this design, and the concept of an ablative hulled shieldship being used to protect smaller vessels as they journey near suns, originated, but one early example is Arthur C. Clarke's "Songs of Distant Earth". Later, Timothy Zahn would use such designs heavily.In terms of positives, director Danny Boyle squeezes a lot out of his small budget. He serves up 2 great sequences (both of which involve bulky space suits), captures 3 or 4 very poetic visuals and his use of music is at times quite affecting. The film has one good example of what I call "epic mundanity". This is where a rather ordinary action is invested with epic weight. Here, the fate of the planet depends on a lowly astronaut valiantly lifting his spacesuit.7.9/10 ? Though a poorly written film populated by stock characters and a ridiculously well informed talking computer, "Sunshine" is punctured by enough excellent visuals to make the ride worth it. Today hard scifi survives mostly in print or in Japan as anime. Ignoring heavyweight authors, you then have guys like Makoto Yukimura ("Planetes") working in graphic novels.Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only movie to ever have me standing up in sheer tension whilst watching it (on DVD, that is), Sunshine is one of the best sci-fi movies of the 21st century. Filled with some really impressive imagery (the sun has never looked so beautiful), great acting, a thought-provoking story, and a tight script which features increasing tension throughout, it's in my opinion Danny Boyle's best movie... yes even better than Scumbag Millionaire (which to be fair wasn't a bad movie either). However, I do have to agree with people who say the film's third act devolves into pointless Slasher-muck, but that alone is not enough to detract from the overall power of the film. Oh, and I loved the Alien/2001/Solaris/insert-awesome-SciFi-flick references. If only they came up with a more appealing title or better marketing scheme.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Technically speaking, the sun will not go out for another five billion years or so, but Hollywood always says no to scientific logic: let's make it twenty years. Set two decades in the future, the eccentric looking Icarus II has been sent out to save planet Earth by reigniting the dying sun using a sort of ultra atomic bomb. There are eight crew aboard, and the world is in their hands.Technically, this is an accomplished picture. It shows good sets, good effects, and sound, and a groovy score. Also, because the movie is not riddled with laser blasts, and lots of cg droids or fighter ships creating a mass of light and sound which gets the adrenaline going, it is easier to pay attention to such strengths in the film, (as it was in 2001). Where Sunshine is not so strong is in acting. The cast is mostly a handful of your average working actors, who tend to play supporting roles in bigger features. If you are a moviegoer, you might recognize a lot of them. Troy Garity from Bandits, Rose Byrne from Troy, Cillian Murphy from Batman Begins, and Michelle Yeoh from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Yeoh is pretty much the only 'above average' name in the cast, and her role is kind of diminutive. Sunshine never really goes over the top, although occasionally it comes close. To kick off the climactic half hour, Sunshine (as so many films) does resort to a ridiculous plot twist, which I won't describe because as ridiculous as it is, it is sort of neat. The heroes are put in a situation where they must fight for their own lives in order save billions of lives back home.Sunshine, although it is not designed to be a thoughtful movie, sort of leaves you thinking about our future. It reminds you of how little power we have in the big scale of the universe. Accomplishing tasks like saving the sun could never happen in real life. It is a concept for the movies, but if done well, it can amount to an entertaining couple of hours, which this is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't realize Danny Boyle made the movie until the end credits started up. A versatile director and a well thought out movie with creditable performances by an ensemble cast. Even though it is a science fiction film the film rotates around the aspect of the human psyche and how human traits can influence any situation, no matter how simple or perilous the circumstances may be. Most of the science fiction films these days also hover around some kind of wry humor, some romance with action sequences to hold the viewer's interest. That this film is devoid of such matters and still manages to keep the viewer absorbed is remarkable. Considering the seriousness of the situation though, it is questionable why would someone choose the name of the ships Icarus I, and then a second ship as Icarus II for an Earth-critical mission involving the Sun. Perhaps a harbinger of things to come? 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Award-Winning director of "Slumdog Millionaire (2008)" directed this film, one year before he made the said film. But this film is almost as good as Slumdog if it stayed constant all throughout. The film's premise is simple. It's also the first problem with this film. 50 years in the future (as of now 48), our sun is dying. What?! Our sun isn't supposed to start dying in 5 billion or more years! And the way it "dies" in the movie is dimming. Well I'm the type of guy who doesn't put too much logic while watching so moving on. Now Our Characters are interesting. We have Scarecrow err... Robert Capa (Cilian Murphy). The Human Torch err... Mace (Chris Evans).Cassie (Rose Byrne) and Mark Strong as Pinbacker but there are a lot more characters. All these characters are fairly interesting except for one who ruins the overall essence of the film. OK spoilers will appear from this point on so if you don't want to know what happens then don't go beyond this line. -----------------SPOILER LINE------------------ So they're on the Icarus II. OK, you named your ship of a god who fell back to the earth after touching the sun or something like that. Then Searle (Cliff Curtis) is MESMERIZED by the beauty of the sun. He puts on his goggles and the sunlight is at 3.1% full brightness. WOW! He can see clearly for the rest of the film (or until half the film). Skipping a few scenes of swearing, wrestling, and Human Torch battling the Scarecrow, the film shows us BEAUTIFUL shots of the Icarus II, space and even a scene of Mercury revolving around the sun. Then one of them detects the first ship that we sent 7 years before, Icarus I. Since the chances of their "payload"(a missile they're gonna use to jumpstart the sun) hitting on target is 1 in millions of possibilities, they say that they should go visit the ship to get an extra payload. But one of the members of the mission (Benedict Wong) reverts the trajectory of the ship's path and accidentally forgets to reset the shields. Blah blah blah, the Captain (Hiroyuki Sanada) and Capa try to fix it. But too late for captain as he gets burnt to death and all Searle cares about is "WHAT DO YOU SEE!?" So skip to the part where they finally dock to Icarus I, when they enter flashes of people in Hawaiian costumes appear for split seconds and I was like: WHAT ARE THESE. But later it's revealed that they are members of Icarus I. Apparently Pinbacker's the one who sabotaged the mission because according to Pinbacker "God told me to bring us all to heaven". OK he let the crew burn to death OK fine! But apparently the ships are disconnected somehow and Capa, Searle, Mace, and Co-Captain (Troy Garity) (Now captain cause captain is dead) are stuck. There's only one suit and Mace and Searle says Capa should have it but Mr. Captain say "Nouuuu Aiii shouuuuld haaaave eeet!!!" so they decide to wrap them up in insulating pads and hug Capa to get to Icarus II's Airlock. Searle sacrifices himself; Harvey gets knocked away and freezes to death. So there still isn't enough oxygen to make it so they vote on to kill Trey or not (Mr. I forgot the shields) they go to kill him but it appears that he committed suicide. Scarecrow and Human Torch rumble again. There isn't enough oxygen but when Capa confirms to Icarus' computer that there are only four people onboard the computer replies five. Capa: Who's the fifth member? Icarus II: Unknown ... ... ... ... This is the first time a film went from sci-fi to slasher and most people don't like this film because of this part. Capa asks Icarus where is the location of "Unknown?" The computer replies "Observation Room. There, Capa sees a white ghostly figure. Danny Boyle also saw this figure to ruin this almost flawless film. Pinbacker's the one who detached the ships awhile ago. Now he slashes Capa and Capa runs for it. Pinbacker sabotages the coolant regulator crap and locks Capa in the airlock. Mace tries to fix the coolant crap but on his way out his foot gets stuck and he freezes to death. THE HUMAN TORCH FROZE TO DEATH? HOLY CRAP! So eventually Capa gets out gets to the payload to finish the mission but Cassie is there with ghosty I mean Pinbacker. The payload tilts 90 degrees, Pinbacker dies Cassie dies, Capa activates the payload, it hits on target. All of them die. The Earth is saved thanks to the POWERPUFF GIRLS err... SCARECROW AND THE FREEZING HUMAN TORCH! err... Capa. But still Danny Boyle Impressed me with this film. The ending is one of the most touching and moving moments in cinema history. Overall, I give this a 78% awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I started to watch this film I realized its similarities to 2001, 2010 and Event Horizon but I wound up enjoying it tremendously. I think the writer must have seen the previously mentioned films, realized their shortcomings and decided to redo the same ideas but right this time. This film is true "hard" science fiction - no supernatural elements, not even aliens, just all too frail human beings versus the laws of physics. Even their talking computer was not that intelligent and did not seem to be sentient, like HAL.Unlike the other films I've mentioned this one had a real purpose to it. 2001, 2010 and Event Horizon had "missions" that could have been dispensed with and no one would ever have noticed. This one is life and death for all humanity and the people on board the Icarus II know this. Their decision to intercept the previous, failed, mission was presented as a coin toss. As it turned out it was a huge mistake, but at least several people said so going in. My choice, by the way, would have been to drop their bomb and, if it didn't work, then go for the first ship. However, the decision was made and then, when everything goes wrong, there was guilt, horror and blame - very real.The bogeyman at the end, unlike the unexplained and incomprehensible presence in Event Horizon, or even HAL or the unknowable aliens in 2001 and 2010 was also very human. They set the stage well by showing the ship's doctor's obsession with sunlight. He risked his health and life by wanting more and more and even asked the dying captain what he was seeing as the other man was incinerated. He then chose to die looking full into the sun. The doctor might have wound up like the other captain if he had lived.I felt the numerous jumpy and arty cuts were a distraction and could have done without them. Overall, however, I felt the movie was very powerful, had real characters and was very well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems many viewers have a strong reaction to Sunshine. Some dismiss it as derivative "crap" while others go so far as to call it a masterpiece and, I quote, "a religious experience". The truth lies somewhere between those two ridiculous extremes.I've always liked Danny Boyle, even though he does put a strong signature on each movie and certain themes tend to make an appearance over and over again. No other filmmaker has this way of filming things in a way that is extremely aesthetic yet extremely rough. In Sunshine, Boyle outdoes himself as far as breathtaking imagery. The space environment is breathtaking, the ships designs (interior/exteriors) are compelling. The pacing is interesting, providing the required tension at times as well as plenty of time to meditate on the gravity of the situation. The cast is solid, if a little too trendy-looking. There are many incredible actors here, starting with Cliff Curtis, one of the most underrated and underused actors in the biz. Boyle's partner in crime, composer John Murphy, is back with another one of his magical, haunting scores. The tracks here are often subdued but there are two or three moments where image and music merge in a sort of dramatic opera, typical of Boyle's movies and... it's just amazing.Having said that, it's not all good. The story is average and rather derivative. I can forgive derivative if there is a purpose behind it. But here, you get the impression it's derivative because it wants to stylistically revisit those cool moments in other movies. We get our little moments reminiscent of Event Horizon, 2001, Solaris and Alien. More aggravating is that this movie could really have benefited from 20-25 extra minutes for character development and further context.Many of the characters are rather thin. The most problematic of all is Cliff Curtis as psychiatrist Searle. Right from the moment is character (who plays a key role in making us relate with the main theme) is introduced, we see holes in the script. We do get the sense that Searle is dangerously fascinated by this journey toward the sun but it just seems.... amateurish and telegraphed. Like a cheap B movie. Cillian Murphy plays the main protagonist, Capa. His character is uninteresting but Murphy nonetheless is convincing as a scientist who is way over his head. He also gets plenty of screen time, which helps him convey all this pressure his character is feeling. Hiroyuki Sanada plays the captain of the Icarus ship and wow, what an AMAZING presence he has! I felt he was extremely commanding without words and yet, without acting like a Hollywood super captain cliché. Unfortunately, his character is again terribly undeveloped.Out of our eight astronauts, one character shines above all. It is Mace and he is surprisingly played very well by none other than Chris Evans. Mace is a fully fleshed out character, very dynamic. If the writing and direction had developed the others as well, we could have had a more organic movie. The rest of the crew is not worth mentioning. All played by good actors, all had interesting possibilities yet all are underdeveloped.Finally, most of the film has an air of "hard science-fiction". For those who wouldn't know, this is sci-fi with a concern for science, as opposed to the more fantastic elements of space opera such as Star Wars, Buck Rogers and so on. This is all well but unfortunately, the science here is often wonky, flawed and in need of proofing. It's nothing to ruin the experience for me but it is as such times that you appreciate the attention to details that a guy like Kubrick was showing, DECADES earlier.The last chapter of Sunshine departs into more whacky territory, as is often typical in Boyle's movies. I must say this is probably his worse showing as a filmmaker as far as capturing that sort of insane climax.In the hands of an average director, this would be a 5. In the hands of a good director, it would be a 6. But Danny Boyle is one of those rare directors who can raise mediocre scripts all by himself. This movie is so damn beautiful. The special effects are near magical (I'd love to experience this on IMAX), John Murphy's score is magnificent and the cast is elite and does its best. So I give it a solid 7.</fullReview>

Its much darker..much more brutal on the audience and far more impressive as a result.. The director dabbles in existentialism briefly but it never threatens to undermine the screenplay. The screenplay is taut, very sombre and while not traditional edge of the seat stuff, keeps you very engrossed. Special effects are pretty good for a Fox searchlight movie.. But the movie is all about the characters. And that is what really sets this movie apart from its regular sci-fi potboiler brethren. The feel of the movie cant but help remind me of "Solaris" ..But its a far better movie. ..The actors are not stars but they certainly pull this movie off.. Chris Evans is a star for the future.. He manages to meld cool headed logic with his boisterous alpha male persona. He is the real scene stealer in the movie. Cillian Murphy does a fine job as well. Rose Byrne is underused in the movie.The movie is totally worth anyones time if they want to explore an alternative interpretation of the sci-fi genre...</fullReview>

As for the strange Icarus1 crew member character - towards the end of the movie - this just warped things even more, causing further mayhem for the already stricken crew and so brings the whole thing to a final crazy climax.

		<fullReview>One can argue about if Danny Boyle succeeded in making an "intelligent" science fiction movie. Fact remains that Sunshine turned out a better scifi movie than what normally comes our way. What really struck me though were the many similarities with the 1968 classic 2001 A Space Odyssey. It's not just the story (a team must go on a long cosmic trip) or the way the corridors were shot, but some scenes almost looked like odes to the famous Kubrick movie. They were: 1) the space walk (causing one casualty) 2) the scene in which they travel through space without a suit 3) the boarding of the first Icarus (okay, that was 2010, but you know what I mean) 4) trying to revive (or in the case of 2001: shut down) the main computer. When you look at Sunshine as an ode to 2001 the last 20 minutes - when the story breaks with reality - aren't that difficult to swallow anymore. Sunshine is no masterpiece but to me it establishes Danny Boyle as one of the most surprising and talented directors of this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK Science Fiction Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine is a good but derivative science fiction movie. The production values are OK and there are nice visuals but overall it's a little disappointing. The film tries to appear intelligent and is occasionally suspenseful but it's also flawed. If you like Sci-Fi you will probably find this film enjoyable, but it's fairly bleak and misanthropic and the ending is something of a let down. The movie is set in the future. The sun is dying and a team of astronauts are sent on a mission to reboot the sun by exploding a nuclear bomb. The team members are not particularly likable and you don't really care what happens to them. The crew seems unsuitable psychologically for the mission they are undertaking. Some of them start to fall apart when the mission starts to unravel. You would expect a crew selected for a mission to save mankind would have been made off sterner stuff. The crew don't bond as a team, and on a mission this important you would expect some group solidarity.Ridley Scott has said that the Sci-fi genre is so tired and unoriginal that it may be dead. Certainly Sunshine is similar to a number of other movies. The basic plot has been lifted from "Armageddon" and "Deep Impact." The scruffy look of the crew and the claustrophobic feel of the ship recalls "Battlestar Gallactica." The philosophical mumbo-jumbo brings to mind "2001" and there are bits of "Alien", "Apollo 13" and "Silent Running" in there as well. If you are in the need of light entertainment, stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: In the not-too-distant future, the sun is about to smoke out. A crew is sent to re-ignite it with a nuclear bomb; when they fail, a new team sets out to finish the job. But they find that flying to the least hospitable place in the solar system and staying sane and alive is no simple matter. My Review: If indeed the film gave you time to ponder similarities to sci-fi movies past, which it does not try to show it's a blend of those you have seen, you might find yourself thinking, it's a mix of "Alien"/"2001"/ some "Event Horizon" &amp; "Solaris" (The Original Russian film) ; if you're being particularly picky. Even some dark undertones of "Blade Runner" all apparent. However it does more that the latter half of those films listed. Adds a smidgen of horror to a beautiful piece of cinematography, light and incandescent effects. Verdict: Boyle's 2001, gritty, realistic and overall excellent. Most films like this focus on what's out there, in the vastness of space; on the inside looking out. This time we are given a bold look from outside looking in. Into our own world; the Star, the Sun. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm giving this film five stars simply because that rating is in the middle of the range. If I had to rate different aspects of the film, I'd probably be handing out one star here and ten stars there.While I'm impressed by so much of the film, including the acting, the CGI, and the careful attention to so many details, I still don't understand what the film is all about. Based on the director's commentary and the comments of many reviewers, I feel as if I should be impressed by the film's statements on atheism and/or religious belief. I'm not, though. In fact, this film says nothing about religious belief. If the director thinks that it does, then he either forgot that he edited out those scenes or he doesn't understand faith and religion. The little bit of babbling about religion that I heard was (literally) the product of a deranged mind and fundamentally incoherent.The plot inconsistencies and scientific inaccuracies don't really bother me that much. You have to be willing to suspend some of your disbelief for the sake of the story. (After all, when someone starts a joke by saying, "A bear walks into a bar and asks the bartender...", nobody stops the joke cold by pointing out that bears can't talk.) But so many of the crises are caused by easily foreseeable circumstances and by human error that it really becomes quite depressing. You're in a continuous state of "How are they going to screw things up next?" If you rent the DVD, be sure to check out the deleted scenes. I truly believe that the movie would have been much better if they had been retained. (With the possible exception of the "Hellraiser" type of alternate ending.) So, is it worth seeing? Yes, I do recommend that you watch this movie. It has so many beautiful images and it is so intriguing that I think you will enjoy the time spent. Just don't be put off when the incredulity meter swings wildly and you really have to swallow a load of hokum.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had this movie on my list of ones to watch... someone told me it was good. That just didn't prepare me for what this movie was- one of the best Sci-Fi movies I've seen in ages. And the only movie I can think of in the last five years that I immediately want to see again (I just finished watching it 30 minutes ago).So, where do I begin? Loved the cast. Every one of them either greatly appealed or repulsed me as the story called for. It's almost silly to list the ones that stood out because there were so many for me: Cliff Curtis (creepy, noble), Cillian Murphy (smart, emotional), Michelle Yeoh (wasn't sure it was her at first... wow, her English is so good compared to Jackie Chan- sorry Jackie), Hiroyuki Sanada (calm, powerful), and Chris Evans (didn't recognize him till over halfway through the movie) all stole scenes and did great stuff. In many ways, very interesting characters on the screen.The visuals. Oh wow, the visuals. I'm not one for pure fluff, but with the story, the tension, and the music... everything just added up to be completely beautiful and powerful.I highly recommend this one to any sci-fi fan or anyone who likes a good movie of any type.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hope reigns not supreme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once in awhile, you are watching a film when you hear that small voice in your head saying "damn this is good....I hope the ending doesn't suck.." What can be more painful for a cinema buff than investing in a film with imaginative and smart plot development, near perfect casting, superb technical elements, and a fun soundtrack...only to have the whole thing devolve into the clichéd morass of a cheap slasher film? "Sunshine" is that kind of movie, and this one will break your heart.Here is my fantasy: That what we see here is the product of producer madness---that Boyle and Garland had scripted an ending that was as intellectually stimulating and thought provoking as the first 90 minutes, and that a fat mogul gumming a stale cigar decreed: "Not bad kids, but it needs a monster or an alien. Go back and rewrite the ending and get me a monster or an alien:. Danny and Alex slunk back forlornly to their lair and were forced against their better judgment to sacrifice their art.That's my story and I'm sticking to it. How else to get past the gut wrenching disappointment? "Sunshine" is tragic for all of us. We will never get to see what would have been one for the ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting apocalyptic/sci-fi thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judging a book by its cover can be a mistake, but judging a movie by its trailer is usually more accurate.After researching last week's theatrical offerings, "The Eye" and "Over Her Dead Body," I decided my time would better spent looking at a recent DVD release that never came to Manhattan."Sunshine" My morbid narrative taste has fueled my interest in apocalyptic thrillers for as long as I can remember.It doesn't matter if humanity has already fallen, or if the end is simply hanging overhead. The apocalypse provides enough psychological and philosophical tension to power even the most flaccid of narratives.Director Danny Boyle created a masterpiece of apocalyptic cinema with the terrifying "28 Days Later." With "Sunshine," he dropped the infected zombies in favor of an impending solar disaster.Fifty years in the future, the Sun is being destroyed from inside by a highly stable form of matter that renders nuclear fusion impossible, by turning common matter on its own kind. The only hope is to send a team of astronauts to detonate a massive, highly energetic bomb, able to destroy this strange matter and restore Sun's natural state.Seven years after the first ship, Icarus 1, disappears, Icarus 2 becomes the planet's last hope for survival. After passing Mercury, the crew uncovers a distress signal from Icarus 1 and decides to rendezvous with the abandoned ship. Murphy's Law takes effect, and a series of mistakes put the mission in jeopardy.On the surface, "Sunshine" is little more than a thematic replica of "Deep Impact" or "The Core." Our planet is in trouble. Send in the calvary.But "Sunshine" avoids numerous disaster movie clichés by showing the crew in relative isolation. We don't see any shots from Earth until the end of the film. Boyle reduces the first act, typically a montage of panic an desperation by the helpless population, to an expository monologue.As the crew fights to retain sanity, certain members have to sacrifice their own lives to save the mission. The relationships between the crew members become the primary focus of the film, helping it avoid the linear narrative of most disaster movies.Unlike "Armageddon" or "Deep Impact," the crew of Icarus 2 knows they will probably die, so their deaths are not a twist.It's an overall enjoyable sci-fi flick with high productions values and a great cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Fun Sci-Fi Film Since Event Horizon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is another example for why I love Danny Boyle films. This movie brought the surrealism and fantasy of 2001:A Space Odyssey with a hint of the fear from Event Horizon to make an awesome Sci-fi film. The plot is simple, but the visual effects and great musical score make this a must see. The movie starts you right out in the action without boring you with the obvious story line. It is not about the story as much as it is about keeping you on the edge of your seat for the whole movie and providing you with the best visual experience that you can get. I loved every minute of it. When the movie was over there was only one thing that I still wanted; more of this movie!Danny Boyle is one of my new favorites. This movie showed that he can make a sci-fi film just as well as he can a bunch of zombies. Cillian Murphy is also a key component to these films with his unique acting style. This was the most fun I have had in a long time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Staring at the sun (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine shouldn't really work. It's like someone has taken the elements of 2001, Alien, Event Horizon and Silent Running, stuck them in a jar, shaken them about and put it on film. But even though Sunshine is derivative, for the most part it works exceptionally well.One of the reasons why the film works is the central concept. I love the idea of a crew having to journey to the sun. There's something extraordinarily powerful about the idea. After all, in the absence of a god, the sun is the next best thing. It's the source of life on our planet ? it's what sustains us. Without it we're nothing. So therefore the journey to the sun becomes a spiritual quest. It's both a journey within and a journey to the source of creation.And the film works magnificently when it touches upon these themes. There are some beautiful moments, the best one being the scene where the crew get to see Mercury pass in front of the sun. It's a reminder of how insignificant we are but how glorious life is. Simple things like this allow us to assess our place in the universe ? it allows us to forget our petty concerns and gain some perspective. In the end we're all circling this star and if its not there to shine its warmth upon us, we wont even be allowed to have our problems and our differences ? our existence hangs on a thread.I also like the scene where one of the characters visits the Earth room as a form of therapy. Here we see what all the characters are trying to preserve ? the forests, the oceans; all the simple things that bring joy to our life. Yet this is what they may all be sacrificing for the greater good. They might not come home from this trip. They may never again feel the sun's warmth from the safety of a few million miles. Therefore this may be the closest they get to be being back home. And there's a nice little scene where Murphy's character sends a message to his family. He tells them that if they wake up one day and it's a particularly beautiful day, they'll know they made it.Another great scene is the one where the Captain perishes. The scene starts off as a kind of standard spacewalk sequence (characters fix things and speak lots of technical jargon) but as things go wrong and the Captain gets consumed by the sunlight it turns into something more than that. It becomes the most emotional part of the film. A lot of the credit for this has to go to the music, which is superb, but there's also the way that the Captain looks into the sun. He knows he's going to die and he knows he can't look into the sunlight for more than a split second before going blind, but looking directly at the star, bare and unprotected, is the closest he's going to get to looking into the eye of god. And so therefore it's more than understandable that he does it. And the psychologist on board even asks him what he sees. Of course, even if he survived the Captain wouldn't be able to answer, words wouldn't be enough, but the moment is wonderfully filmed and played. Along with the Mercury scene, it's one of the highlights of the film.However, even though I love the first two thirds of the film, it goes downhill in the final act. All the interesting questions that the film raises are jettisoned in favour of a slash and stalk finale that is generic in the extreme.But having said that, things start off promisingly enough. I like the use of subliminal shots of the dead Icarus 1 crew when the astronauts enter the ship. It helps build the tension and sense of unease. I even like the revelation of the burnt surviving member ? he stands in the observation room, light streaming off of him like he's a demon or something. But in the end he just becomes another religious madman with unbelievable cunning and resources of strength. And it's even sillier in the face of the fact that he's burnt to a crisp. Apparently getting charred gives you superhuman strength.And it's here that the film just basically becomes Event Horizon. In light of what comes before, it's deeply unsatisfying. People get stabbed in the dark and the blood flows. Nothing new to see here. There's even a wink to Ridley Scott's masterpiece when one of the characters says that they might get picked off one by one by an alien. Yeah, I don't really want a serious film to wink at me. And besides, if the last third of the film was as imaginative as the rest, there'd be no need for nods and winks as it wouldn't be covering old ground. But even though it's disappointing, Boyle is strong enough of a director to at least make the finale entertaining. However, you can't help but feel that everyone involved didn't have a clue how to end the film and that this is the result.Another minor gripe is some of the acting. Chris Evans is pretty bland and square and Rose Byrne is even worse ? she's so incredibly wet. But such is the strength of the film's visuals, its effects, its music, its production design and its ideas that the lacklustre ending and a couple of mediocre performances don't impair it too seriously. It's a very good film that could have been a great one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did Anyone Notice Pinbacker's Strength???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantastic up until the "agreed upon" moment when Capa inquires as to who the fifth crew member is. While this infamous 3rd act start point, which radically ruins the pace and intent of the movie, could have been given roughly another hour or so of film time to properly work itself in....it was followed by some really, really, really strange screenplay problems. Apparently that writer strike happened early, and on Alex Garland's assisting crew. Despite all the science factual flaws surrounding the actual problem of the dying star, it is necessary to remind yourself that it is just a movie made by movie makers not scientists. Unfortunately this is why Pinbacker is a shame on the part of the movie makers going where they were initially going on the genre because everything, although not necessarily accurate, is forgivably logical to this point. This is when and how it gets destructive and ruins the movie: 1. Apparently Capa felt is was imperative that he immediately "segway" down the hall to the observation room without alarming the others about the mysterious crew member. Not only to rush into the scene alone but to approach a figure with complete 3rd degree burns so close as to start kissing. Wow. For someone with enough quick cognitive thought to appreciate a second "last chance" he sure doesn't seem to magically appreciate the situation of a stowaway in deep, deep space. So after he gets attacked he flees, unable to alert the others, and we see scene after scene of how amazing this Captian Pinbacker is at destroying a movie.2. Did anyone notice Capa requesting the computer to lock the observation door behind him? Did anyone notice Capa adjusting the filter dial to max when fleeing? Apparently when you lose your dermal layer of skin you somehow become impervious to the solar heat of the unfiltered sun AND somehow escape a room locked by voice command. I guess Captain Pinbacker logged into the computer to add his voice and file after secretly killing Trey.3. Did anyone notice the sheer superhuman strength of Captain Pinbacker? Apparently after losing most of his entire integumentary system, eating space dust, chanting religious mumbo-jumbo to himself in the dark, and bathing in radioactive sun rays in his spare time for the better part of 7 years he acquired the ability to feel no pain whatsoever and lift/carry a normal-sized adult male (Capa) with one arm fully extended for about 20 feet. Only to dangle him (still with the one arm that is, mind you, severely malnourished, burned, and infected) out from the edge of the reactor core. Wow. Looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger had at the screenplay for a few minutes when Garland wasn't looking. I suppose Garland noticed and quickly rushed back to pen the rest which would explain why Captain Pinbacker suddenly became human again and responded to being stabbed. It would also explain why Capa suddenly came to grips that he is being held...in the air...by the neck...over a ledge...by one severely burned arm...that is fully extended........(I can't believe I'm the only one that paid attention during this scene).....and then rips most of the arm off to flee. Which is strange because one frame shows the arm ripping completely off and in the next it's the secondary skin that is pulled free. Ummm, editing anyone? Pick a take already. Anyways, we are then left to watch Captain Pinbacker look at his mangled arm and stand in a strange Sam Raimi's Darkman stance while Capa slides down the ledge. Don't know about you but I think there's a few important arteries in an arm that kind of have to remain connected and if not one would naturally fall to their knees in shock/pain before immediately passing out. Wow. "In space....No One Hears the Biology Teacher" Congrats...ruined movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Almost-Perfect Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The general problem with science-fiction today is, that it has a very limited audience. Being a genre that people mostly associate with gigantic futuristic space ships, cheesy aliens, time travel and generally overacted scenes filled with geeky lingo and terminology, it has become very difficult for sci-fi to reach the general public. Big-budget franchises, such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien and others have through time managed to break through to the mainstream viewer and gained themselves a reputation, but sci-fi in general is still considered slightly to be something of a "geek genre".For me personally, science-fiction doesn't have to bad, by definition. Ironically, the best sci-fi is often more the one that knows not to emphasize the "fiction"-part too much. Such is also the case in "Sunshine", director Danny Boyle's and scriptwriter Alex Garland's independent debut in the genre. The plot, set around 50 years into the future, centers around a natural phenomenon, that might well occur in the distant future; our sun dying, which would inevitably lead to all life on Earth also dying. The global community has therefore decided to send a team of experts into the Sun to "reignite" it. The mission fails, and seven years later, another similar vessel is sent to continue where the first one left off. The plot takes a turn, when they discover what is left of the first vessel.The thing that is so wonderful about "Sunshine" is, that it doesn't suffocate the viewer with futurism, bombastic images (although the CGI effects are marvelous!) and that stereotypically exaggerated feel of our future world that plagues most of the sci-fi movies. It focuses rather on the realism and the humane perspective of it all. I admit, these are themes that can be found in any sci-fi movie, but believe me, neither "Armageddon" or "Event Horizon", movies with very similar plots, cannot beat "Sunshine" here. Danny Boyle once again proves that he masters not only the atmosphere of the moments, but also the portrayal of the human psyche and behavior of individuals placed in extraordinary situations. One must also give huge credit to the cast for this. As a small note, I'm also very happy to see that for once, "the World" does not equal the Americans; we have Asians, Brits and even an Aussie on board."Sunshine", is however, unfortunately not the ultimate sci-fi movie. For the hardcore genre fans, the focus and pace of the movie may be a bit slow and dragging, and for the true nitpickers, the physics and science is far from perfect. For me personally, what really drew me off, was the bad ending. What initially starts off as a glowing touch of color in a gray world of copycat science-fiction, turns towards the end into a horrible cliché. Without revealing any of the plot at this point, I just have to say, I had come to expect better of Boyle, since these are things we've seen all to many times before. Nevertheless, for the viewer who is interested in a more realistic, atmosphere-driven and not to mention graphically beautiful piece of science-fiction, I truly recommend "Sunshine".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It looked nice at times, but it was inevitably predictable for the most part, and kinda ridiculous at others. There is no real development as to "why" the greatest scientific minds would suddenly become a sun worshiping suicide cult, it's intimated with the sun room sure, but it's just not developed in any significant way. The dilemma's and choices this crew faces are no more existential than those faced by the crew of Lost In Space. The addition of the slasher in the third act, sank any remaining sense of reality or dignity for this film and it's crew. The use of light is actually the most interesting aspect of the film, and it may warrant further discussing for those interested in the use of "lighting" in film, but for those us of who were interested in "light" in psychology, or more directly the role of "light" in this story, don't expect anything substantial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Light takes 8 minutes to travel from the Sun to Earth. But as far as I know, it takes 1 million years for a photon to travel from the Suns core to it's surface. Due to the enormous mass and equally enormous amount of hydrogen that photons can bump into, a photon changes trajectories an infinite number of times before it's release into the corona.Then again, one could argue that the fission reaction created by the Icarus 2 could speed up that process, but how much? As far as I know, the Sun is already a fission reaction in itself, and creating another similar reaction will not necessarily result in clearer sunlight on Earth for another 1000 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Sunshine's trailer, I got very excited because I have loved all of Danny Boyle's work, especially the work done with the writer of 28 Days Later (who also wrote Sunshine!). The very day it came out, I went and saw it, and through the first two thirds of the movie I could not help but love this movie its 2001: A Space Odessey sort of feel where it shows the cool, new, and different things of future space exploration. The characters are well casted, and the first two thirds are well written and different than almost any movie ever before. But with almost every great success, there is a failure. The "failure" for this movie was its third act. The fun Space Odessey things disappeared which was the start of the downfall which was made up of some strange Alien homage, with people being picked off one by one. This was not a really bad idea, it just was not executed well because it felt rushed, and the camera effects that were used were far from anything different, truthfully, the camera effects that were supposed to make some of the third act cool only made it worse. You must realize though that I put the word failure in quotation marks, and I have a reason. Although I am complaining about the final act, it was far from failure, it was just a failure in comparison to the fantastic first two parts of that movie. In the end, I truly enjoyed myself watching this movie, just watch out for some decrease in the impressiveness of Sunshine within the third act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You might call me a conspiracy theorist but I am under the impression that these comments posted here are written by paid professionals, praising in vain any film that they are told so. This movie is average at its best. From long years I am outraged by the poor quality of sci-fi movies in comparison to sci-fi literature. This movie is no exception. People! These movie-writers insult our intelligence! You see I can take any fruit of the human imagination, from ghosts to wizards or anything that makes a good story, but this lack of logic has no place in a sci-fi movie, the term "science" obliges us to a certain level of mind work. I am sorry, I cannot overlook these logical, scientific gaps in the story, they are too evident. As for the visuals and the actors job, again, I cannot say more than: average. But the main problem is the story; it is forced and full with well known clichés, nothing new under the sun. I would be really interested in a story which would REALLY deal with the questions raised in this one.Jesus, what a waste of precious celluloid. Any kid with imagination could write a better a story. Not to mention adapting any of the great sci-fi stories written by any serious writer, but unfortunately we saw what happens when they are adapting? To sum up, don't take this as a very negative opinion, I was simply outraged by the praising comments of this movie, not necessarily the movie itself, as I said the movie is average, it can clearly stand a contest with other sci-fi movies produced lately, you should absolutely see it, just don't expect the revelation we are looking for from years now.(hey, now I read more comments of this movie, here on IMDb, and 80% of the comments say that this is a shitty movie, I'm kind of contempt now, but why aren't some of these negative comments displayed on the comments pane on the first page, especially if it works on a random rotation? - a conspiracy!!!! I would be very disappointed if IMDb would fall vassal to business interests)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the few movies that depicts people with high-character but doesn't end in a conformistic 'go-home-and-sleep-tight' finale. It amazes me that space crews have been in similar situations - read about all of the things that the Apollo 11 crew went through and the public never learned about until recently. Every single actor delivers a more than convincing performance - something that honors the producers for their choices. The scenario is very original hands-down. Climax escalates nicely too. Graphics are breathtaking without being overwhelming.For the sake of fairness there are some goofs too: At the last few scenes sun's gravitational force should be far to immense for anyone to withstand it - not to mention walking inside a craft not designed to be manned and also spinning out of control.Overall though I think that all these are excusable in the frame of the message that this movie is so nicely trying to pass through. And that is how to keep 'high-character', 'courage' and finally 'do-the-right-thing' even when the entire hell brakes loose. The viewer can't help but identify himself with the astronauts that fight their way through any mistakes or misfortunes they come across using every bit and piece of their hearts, souls, wills and wits to deliver their mission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just a sci fi flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Boyle (28 days later, the beach, trainspotting) does it once again! Presenting us with a weird yet wonderful masterpiece. Now, sci-fi flicks have never really been my thing, and whilst this is what it is, it strikes an uncanny resemblance in parts to that of the alien franchise. But is this just your typical run of the mill sci-fi film? I think not. At the beginning, we learn that the sun is in danger of dying out thus eliminating the human race. The story line is fairly dark and most of the time very believable thanks to cillian murphy (28 days later, Batman begins)&amp; co who give and inspirational and flawless performances. With music and sound effects that resemble those oh so marvelous early 90's horror films, It sets the tone for the climax that is built up in an ominous way but unfortunately is Quickly ruined by constant barrages of light which quickly become annoying.If you manage to get past the annoyance of the light issues in this film. you will see that there's more to the story than just the salvation of humanity. It brings up issues of survival and and what we depend on, often pointing to the fact that our race is in control of nothing and we are not the ones to decide weather mankind lives or not.Overall, a very surprising triumph and recommended to sci-fi and horror fans alike</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is the meaning of true sacrifice?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sun is dying and humanity is facing extinction. In order to save itself, humanity launches the Icarus I which had the mission of restarting the sun by launching a specially built and designed bomb with the ability to restarting the star. That mission failed under mysterious circumstances. Now, the crew of the Icarus II, seven years after the failure of the first mission, must save the sun in one last ditch attempt before humanity is extinguished.The Icarus II is a multinational team which each crew member a specialist in his or her own field. Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sananda) captains the Icarus II while keeping in mind the possible disaster that affected his predecessors' ship. Other crew members include Corazon (Michelle Yeoh), Cassie (Rose Byrne), Trey (Benedict Wong), Harvey (Troy Garity) Searle (Cliff Curtis), Mace (Chris Evans) and Capa (Cillian Murphy). Stuck together on a 16 month mission, tension of course is inevitable between some members of the crew, particularly Mace, who find the distance and separation from home growing unbearable with each passing day. Thus Searle, the ship's psychologist, finds himself busy ensuring that the crew stays sane while all the while finding himself adrift in the philosophical meaning of what their mission is about.Sunshine plays out mainly through the thoughts and feelings of Capa who is the ship's physicist. While the other characters are important, especially in dealing with the various disasters that Icarus II faces, Capa is the one who is responsible for the detonating the bomb and thus is the most important person on the ship after Kaneda. However while each character faces their own internal conflicts such as Cassie fears an impending death, Trey's blaming of himself for a navigational mistake that leads to the death of Kaneda, and Harvey wanting to ensure his own position within the crew even when it is apparent that he is the weakest emotionally, Capa is the only one who is able to remain sane and rational even when facing the worst situation.One shouldn't view Sunshine and see it just as a disaster movie or even really a space movie. The underlining themes include morality, faith, and the question of the individual as a whole. This is where Sunshine's true strength comes from in that each crisis brings out the best and sometimes the worst in each character and this will force a change in their relationship to each other. Sunshine is the story of humanity in just a grand epic kind of way but also on a personal level that few movies of this genre are able to reach.Unfortunately, in an attempt to add more drama to the situation, Icarus II discovers Icarus I and the fate of its fallen crew. It is there that the discovery of the real reason of the first mission's failure leads to a ridiculous series of events that almost undoes everything that Sunshine was building up. Instead of a movie about the greater scheme of life in the face of disaster, Sunshine turns to a stereotypical plot of frightening chases and fighting between Capa and the now insane captain of Icarus I.Sunshine attempts to follow the steps past classic sci-fi movies such as 2001 Space Odyssey which were centered more on human drama and philosophical meaning then random special effects and alien encounters. For the most part Sunshine is able to deliver such a feeling of "grandness" and the scope of the mission that the Icarus II is on. This is truly a theater movie in that one is easily immersed into the special effects of the solar winds, searing heat, and the utter darkness of space itself as the Icarus II is propelled towards its own destruction but also the rebirth of the sun. If there is ever a movie that requires a home theater set up then this is it.Be that as it may, Sunshine however fails to follow through with its classic leanings and overwhelming tension with a lackluster chase scene. This is too bad because Sunshine had so much going for it. However, Sunshine still has much going for it and it shouldn't be dismissed. There is much here is one is willing to sit through a mediocre ending.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, epic, dark, and almost great. But not quite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know the premise. I love thoughtful sci-fi and was really excited by the trailer. Sunshine collects many of the genre clichés into a nice package. There is the crew of specialists who are their own worst enemies (Alien, Aliens), the EVA scene and the ubiquitous suiting up, the "hurry! get back in the ship!" moment, the airlock as plot device (2001, Aliens), the talking computer(every sci fi movie), the noble sacrifice, loss of communications with home, the huge pans across the ship's axis to show you how big it all is (every spaceship movie), the conversations about life and death (Solaris) and yes, the computers that "beep-beedie-beep" when text passes across the screen (every movie with a computer).This also has the oft-seen derelict ship from the previous mission that they thought was lost (Black Hole, 2010, Event Horizon), hand wringing and blame over big decisions, a lonely distress call, a last journal entry from the captain with a pixelated screen warning them of scary stuff, and the tunnels with flickering flourescents (Alien). Do I sound jaded? Maybe. But I do love this kind of stuff, and director Boyle makes it look so beautiful. There are just certain things that every space voyage would have to deal with. Mafia movies, westerns, submarine flicks have their clichés, so space opera can too. The good: The ship seems very realistic. No streamlining needed so it's basically what a real space station would look like: functional. The garden is great and would be very necessary on a real voyage. Michelle Yeoh is the plant expert and she is visably shattered by a fire in the greenhouse. The FX are seamless and appear often. Great art direction and set design. The characters are well written and I was sad to lose a few of them. The cast does a nice job with each one. The sun is a star in this film (hah - a pun!) and the crew is fascinated with their close up views, but also terrified by its power to destroy. A real sense of wonder here. Great music to go with the visuals. No musical montage scenes! And everyone dies - no survivors - thank you for not teleporting the hero back to safety. Influence of other films: 2001, Alien, Silent Running, Solaris, 2010. The bad: The communications officer was a solid character, but then he has this freak-out moment when he realizes he's going to die. It's poorly written and poorly played. Gravity is a factor in the film, but they seem to have the ability to switch it on and off. Ex: everybody walks around the ship, except when they float out for an EVA, and there is lots of spinning architecture but none of seems to be for creating gravity. The characters all seem way too young for the important roles they are playing. The most top nuclear physicist in the world looks like he's 23. The pilots are both about 20. It's like Friends in space. Real astronauts would be the veterans of the program, not some mod squad of hipsters. Also, real astronauts from Apollo and Gemini knew the risks were so well trained that fear hardly played into it. The drama with films is in these life and death situations, stuff that real pilots handle with a cool head always - it's part of the culture. When you read The Right Stuff, and astronaut autobiographies of men like Alan Shepard, Jim Lovell, Gene Cernan, and Tom Stafford, these guys are totally at home in a crisis. There wouldn't be all this wigging out and getting sketchy or wanting to commit suicide. The movie turns into a horror flick in the 3rd act, and it gets lame. Naked dude who got all religious on the outbound flight - he's the heavy. Big damn deal. You know how space opera sets itself up for disaster - they set the bar so high in act 1, that nothing can meet the payoff. Even the great 2001 builds and builds and builds and then .... a baby floating in space. That's it. Remember Mission to Mars (that turd bomb from a few years ago?) They build it up and the payoff is some white light and skinny grey aliens like you see on a Roswell bumber sticker. Here, this burn victim is the best they could come up with. He's been alive on his ship for 7 years getting a sunburn and now he kills for Jesus. Run, it's the human scab! What the hell? When the payload is dropped into the sun, up-down-sideways lose all meaning. In the finale, hero hangs onto spacecraft while thrusters fire, prompting grimaces and feats of strength. In reality, you could hold on with one finger. Wearing the heavy EVA suit in the ship while in gravity is just not happening either. In one scene, two crewmen wrap themselves in foil and get shot out of an airlock through space and into another open ship (a la 2001). Their blood would boil instantly from the zero pressure and then they'd explode, but we're shown one guy frosting over into a popsicle when he misses to hole, while another who makes it just gets frostbitten. They do an EVA to the derelict ship wearing little more than bandanas over their mouths instead of environment suits.Admittedly, Sunshine aims to show us the inner struggle; that the human mind may be the most dangerous factor when isolated far from home on a trip into the sun. Watch it on a big screen and with the sound way up, like space opera should be viewed. Check out Solaris for a real journey into the space traveler's head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>just seen it for the second time, first at Hatfield, England which is one of the few digital image cinemas in Europe. The picture is so bright it almost hurts, crisp and clear and startling. Then last night at The Rex Cinema Berkhamsted (the best cinema in the UK). OK the script unravels a bit and someone thought 'Event Horizon' was inspirational, but it is simply stunning to watch (and hear). I envy those who have yet to see it, relax and let it wash over you. Argue on the way out why it wasn't a bit more user friendly and slipped into The Old Dark House routine in the last 30 minutes.But don't wait for the DVD it simply won't look the same...unless you sit 2" in front of a 60" plasma. Wonderful visual &amp; aural experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, tense is not a strong enough word. This movie was absolutely terrifying. In the cinema I was thinking, Whilst this is a good movie and I would recommend it to anyone, I will probably never watch it myself again. It was just too intense. I do have a few problems with it. The plot for one; it starts off very plausible for a sci-fi and continues to be very believable until the last half hour or so. The mood is established enough that by that point you should really be into the film enough to go along with anything (see Alien for what I mean here), but there are a few factors which just create this huge gaping plot hole. I won't spoil anything but if you watch it just pay attention to the situation and remember the time frame that is mentioned.I've got to say, the acting and direction were spot on. Cillian Murphy is brilliant as always, as is Michelle Yeoh, Hiroyuki Sanada and Cliff Curtis, but all are outshone (ignore the pun please) by Chris Evans. Yes that's right, the Human Torch. The role was so different from his previous roles and he handled it ridiculously well. That was the biggest surprise of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd like to begin by saying what most fans of this movie would say.....This is indeed a very underrated movie,and i don' have a clue as to why it is so. The movie was so intriguing it kept me glued to the seat till the end. The special effects used in the movie kept my mouth hanging open all the time; not just mine even all my friends with whom i watched the movie were awed by the mesmerizing depiction of the outer space. Hats of to the imagination of Danny Boyle and his team. You sir have produced a masterpiece in the science fiction genre.The story is good The casting is excellent. Cillian Murphy was absolutely brilliant and he was well supported by the talented Chris Evans, Rose Byrne, Michelle Yeoh, Cliff Curtis, Hiroyuki Sanada and the others, who executed their roles to perfection. I guess this is the only movie which i can watch it innumerable times for its special effects(I do watch my favorite scenes of the movie daily... DAILY!!!!) The ending of the movie might be a disappointment to many, but it all depends on how you interpret the ending, which in turn depends on whether you caught hold of what Boyle's idea was. Even so you wont feel that the movie was bad nor that it dragged on,and you's give a thumbs up for it without a second thought. And the music, well the word that may come close to describing is... 'BEAUTIFUL' and the same word describes the entire movie. Please do watch this movie, it is my request to all who have come across this review section of the IMDb page. It is a piece of art, nothing short of a cult classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought I would finally do a review for Sunshine and it seems a bit overdue after seeing it for the first time about 3 years ago. For some stupid reason it took me this long to actually buy it and watch it for a second time. I wanted to get myself familiar with it before writing this because I remember my first experience with Sunshine being a brilliant one.One thing that suddenly crept up on me after watching it again is that Danny Boyle has never made a bad film (in my opinion) he shows an eagerness to try every genre once and he has done a brilliant job. Whether it's a thriller, drama, horror or science fiction, he puts a lot of passion into his work and is slowly becoming one of my favourite directors.The story of Sunshine revolves around the potential end of the world as a result of the sun dying. The fate of mankind rests with a group of scientists who attempt to travel to the sun to deploy a bomb that will ignite a miniature star within the sun in order to prevent the death of our planet. As you would expect, things don't go to plan. I make that sound as if the plot is predictable and in certain moments it can be. What makes the film stand out however is the total devotion to making it as real as possible within a science fiction environment.For starters, the interaction between the group is outstanding. The cast lived together for quite some time prior to shooting in order to make the acting natural. When watching this I was reminded of Alien, quite a lot. The crew of the Nostromo were truckers not heroes and this was reflected in the performances and how natural the dialogue was. Granted that the plot of Sunshine is completely different and the dialogue is going to be slightly sexed up to keep it gripping but it kept Alien's natural flow and seemed totally convincing.Professor Brian Cox had a lot of involvement with the science behind the film. There is nothing worse than a sci-fi movie trying to take itself seriously and then get the science totally wrong (Armageddon). The film works well because of its attempt to make the science convincing whether that's through acting or through visuals. There has been some criticism regarding certain aspects of the science but these seem to be things that would have jeopardised certain shots or certain plot points and this could have quite possibly affected the end product.&nbsp;One thing that I had a real problem with first time round watching Sunshine was the final 20 minutes where it becomes a bit too fast paced and it certainly stands out from the rest of the film. After watching it again I realised that it isn't as bad as what I made it out to be, however it could have possibly been avoided.&nbsp;So my final verdict is a good one. Sunshine is a good, solid science fiction movie that is taken extremely seriously and is done with a very strong essence of realism. The visuals are absolutely outstanding and the characters are beautifully played. You care about their fate because they are heroes and their actions throughout the film have come naturally to them because you know that they are genuinely great people who want to help humanity.&nbsp;Danny Boyle has openly said that he would never do sci-fi projects again. Let's just hope he changes his mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ride you simply gotta catch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the 3rd film directed by Danny Boyle i managed to see and only now I'm absolutely positive i'll watch them all. The premise alone sounds a bit cliché, washed up - 8 astronauts on a way into an almost certain death, ready to sacrifice their lives to save a dying sun and earth.We'll all agree - not promising,actually a very dangerous material to be handled properly because of its sci-fi background. Many times exploited idea, squeezed till every little drop that could have made you excite and think was erased in any previous attempts made in many similar apocalyptic scenarios. But here the story doesn't revolve around the doom day pathetic save the world stuff, here we actually see 8(+ extra)human beings. Also might add the space as an breathing entity for itself, great, dark and bright, quiet and screaming, a void we live in, here presented more vividly and alive than anything i have seen before. The camera is perfect, adding another joy to the whole experience. Here is Mr. Boyle's turn to spice the meal in a manner only known to him. And the results are mildly said worthy. Simply Danny is A-list director but his films are still a mystery for most of a-list audience. I would also like to salute Mr. Scarecrow, brilliantly done. Only drawbacks I've spotted were the ones considering physics, for example a large mass body standing still next to sun witch is the most powerful source of gravity in our/every solar system...etc.So u'we got the idea, I could annoy you like this for ages, simply watch the movie and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie, I enjoyed watching from the beginning. I love sci-fi movies, but I have strong reservations for this kind of movies to be "realistic". What do I mean by that?! Well... For example: George Lucas... Star Wars... He made a world of his own, took in account the laws of the physics that are obeyed in his world( e.g. sound in space) and he took his time to make the world real. An example of what I don't like in movies is Iron Man 2. He just pulled a switch, mixed an alloy and made a new chemical element... I mean seriously... Why am I telling you this?! Because the sci-fi movies, that are meant to be as real as they can get, Sunshine is one of them, the movies that centre in our near future, are the ones, that can, by my standards, have the most mistakes, that make the movie "unreal". So if I gave Sunshine a 10/10... That means that this movie really didi it for me. It is realistic, with one big mistake in my eyes... What mistake... I call it: The man that should be dead mistake. But OK... He is a character, that begins the twist in the movie. By twist I mean the change in the "genre" of the movie. All in all, it is a mistake that really isn't as bad as it may seen, because the movie really does make you feel, that in 50 years... We really could go to the sun. Excellent acting in my perspective, and a story that will hook you. Enjoy watching this movie, for it is worth it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Sci-Fis on film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is simply one of those masterpieces that won't go away soon.I had thought Supernova would not be surpassed -- I was wrong.Good international array of characters, good actors. Chris Evans, whom I became first aware of with the first serious introduction of The Fantastic Four to film, plays a serious, driven crew member dedicated to delivering a payload to the sun for the salvation of mankind. Though, I really like Chris Evans' performances in general (noting I have only seen 4 to date), I enjoyed this different role. Add to this that he is not the main character, that is a good start.This is an action picture with pathos: in this scenario, our sun is dying. Our best scientists, backed by what is left of our governments, are making a last ditch effort to revive our star. Our oceans appear to be freezing over (from the parting shot we are given in Sydney, Australia). A second and final vessel is now on its way to the sun with what is last of a payload we think might start up our sun again. Things, however, do not go as planned..There is a mystique to the sun that haunts the human rescue missions. People are playing with fire as they face something that is greater than anything they have ever experienced before. Visions and nightmares are experienced by many if not all of the members. Then there is an error. Exposure of unprotected parts of the vessel to the sun's solar power almost ends our heroes' last chance. The captain is lost. Fuel is lost. The oxygen factory is lost. Then, the first original rescue mission, the first failure which has elicited this secondary response, is found and the two vessels are forced to dock. But, more goes wrong. And the crew is whiddled down to a few as it is accepted that the mission is now a suicide mission but with a homicidal ghost on board, a 3rd degree burn mad-man of unbelievable strength who has talked to God and thinks that he is the last Adam.Everyone dies but the mission is a success. And, I am sitting there going 'wow.' Very well done. Considerably better than 2001: a space odyssey, which it seems to echo. If this is an art film, it is not to the point of losing its audience. This was my first experience viewing Cillian Murphy's work, and Director Danny Boyle's, amazingly. Michelle Yeo is terrific and very believable in her role here. As a story and film, this shines. But, oh, the pathos!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've recently abstain myself watching sci-fi films because I got my brains exhausted with my college life. Watching them would be tantamount to this exhaustion. At anyway around, this film has to be admittedly a brilliantly nice film. Indeed it is unrealistic to imagine the setting and structure of the story, but when you got into it you gradually realize and understand its concept. I got the hard time understanding most sci-fi films due to their outlandish theories about this and that, etc. Sunshine had to be different. I admit that all their explanations, ideas and concepts embedded in the story appear substantially hard to follow but the objective is the story. So what is the story all about? Our sun is dying because of this "Q-ball" thing contaminating the sun, and whole mankind need to respond. Just stick to the story and you'll be fine to go (if you still had the hard time, well better if you watch the film with subtitles or watch it in a considerable audible volume).What's far more interesting about the movie was that you got to see the details of technology man had imagined and transformed into reality. Science and creation got into mix and its fine and worth to see on big screen. The actors played their role well. We can see they have their own personality and character distinct and evident from each other. We see these characters mend through the story and how they respond into situations they got into. I also got fond of watching Michelle Yeoh and Hiroyuki Sanada in this unlikely heavily-CGI-effects-film, and their characters are worth watching for. Cillian Murphy, Rose Byrne, Chris Evans and Cliff Curtis are good to portray their distinct characters as well. Benedict Wong, Troy Garity and Mark Strong are also good to go. I'm impressed as well how real existing science institutions had us peak to their discoveries and inventions (CERN and NASA). I got fond as well of seeing these things since I read Dan Brown's novel (most particularly Deception Point). It is worth watching for a few times and it is the first sci-fi movie I ever watched that got me enthralled and felt the emotions of the character in an unlikely scenario. They had depicted well the probabilities of what world would be in the future and how people would respond to such universal transformation. Two Thumbs up! Very Brilliant Film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you remember The Core? Where bunch of people went down to earth core to "fix" it? Well, after few years I saw that flick, there were these rumours about another movie about a bunch of people, who fly to ('ahem') SUN to "fix" it. Starring Chris Evans. My reaction to all this info was like "get the hell outta here!" Until this year, I didn't know anything more about this movie, since my friend recommended it's soundtrack. So looked up this "Sunshine" title and... whoa, Danny Boyle? OK... And what a nice surprise it was! I gave it 9/10, it just needed one point down for some similarities with Event Horizon, 2010 and maybe other sci-fi space movies. But still, very moving. And even though the idea of blowing a bomb in the sun (to "fix" it:) sounds so improbable and corny, this movie makes the case look like possible mission. And Dr. Brian Cox from CERN as a science adviser for this movie is a solid confirmation for that. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danny Boyle once again tackles a different genre, that of science fiction. Among the many things, what I appreciate about Boyle, is that he does not choose his subjects just for the sake of making something different but the man really gives his all to the craft. 'Sunshine' is no ordinary science fiction flick with aliens, robots etc. It is atmospheric, philosophical, intense and chilling. The influence by movies like '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Event Horizon', 'Alien' and 'Solaris' is visible and Boyle makes good use of it.The claustrophobia, the tension and the underuse of hightech inside the spaceship is very effective. The visuals, especially the scenes with the sun, are mesmerizing. The final climax sequence is marvelously executed and cinematography is terrific.Boyle is evidently a fan of Alex Garland (his previous films, '28 Days Later' and 'The Beach' were based on Garland's novels) and Garland's writing is another highlight of the movie. The story derived from a novel concept about the sun dying out and consequently effecting the earth is creatively written into a story that is wonderfully told. The writing of the characters is superb and all of them are given a strong identity and equal importance. There is no token character who is merely killed off for the purpose of more violence and whatever. The viewer cares about the fate of the eight astronauts as they bravely fight circumstances in order to complete the mission to rescue humanity. There is a sense of doom where we know how it will end but wishful thinking makes us hope they survive and when they bravely encounter death it is both frightening and saddening.Another amazing thing about the storytelling is that every time you expect the film to take the path of a clichéd plot, you're cleverly thrown off towards another direction. Such as the sequence where Corazon mentions that there isn't sufficient oxygen for everybody but enough for four), I was expecting a blood battle where the astronauts are killing off each other). The element of suspense is brilliantly built. The dialogues are philosophical and they beautifully add dimension to the story while giving us something to think about.The cast is fantastic. I liked that it was an international cast rather than an all-American or British team rescuing the world. I love watching actors from different parts of the world work together. Cillian Murphy, Cliff Curtis, Michelle Yeoh, Hiroyuki Sanada, Rose Byrne, Benedict Wong, Chris Evans and Troy Garity are all fabulous.To sum it up, 'Sunshine' is another remarkable and underrated piece of cinema from Danny Boyle. It's a film for anyone who is looking for more than the usual 90-minutes entertainment. It's a cinematic treat!</fullReview>

It went so well and I felt so involved in what's going on but after the scene with Pinbacker killing the Japanese female character, the movie lost it's glare. Everything turned into a b-class scary movie. I get the religion factor that has to get in into stuff like this but come on, this Pinbacker character is just out of place . The religion factor could have been better incorporated. Another thing is, although it's thinking too deep, i suppose logically, the garden would probably have the sunshine filtering system we see throughout the movie. Other than that, the movie is really good when it comes to scientific facts. Naked human in space vacuum is well presented. In the end, I think everyone who wants to see a well done movie, watch 2/3 of this movie. You will see some of the real good instruments that form a good movie. Such as the usage of green and blue all around the interior and then blazing your eyes with sunshine when showing the exterior.</fullReview>

As it neared the end, I found myself wanting more, more, more. The directing is genius. The acting (although its hard to believe that most people on a mission such as this would be so attractive) is superb for their intended roles. Watching this movie, the viewer will soon realize that the directing is not the same as your average film. It is nearly on the same pace as Kubrick's, "2001," only slightly faster pace with more stylized editing. So many meanings, so many ways to interpret the little undertones. Over all, great story, great acting, incredible directing. I cannot recommend this film enough. Even attempting to is futile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this recently on sky movies premier, normally when I watched sky movies, my attention is easily drawn away, but not with sunshine, I was glued! The film my have been done on the cheap ($20 million), but you don't need a massive budget to make a good film, money isn't everything in film making, it helps, but not essential. The story is totally believable, the acting flawless, the special effects are fantastic too. The computer core being cooled in tanks of below zero coolant is very believable, and how computers are probably going to be, with there increased performance and current cooling problems, it's the logical step, and has been done in real life to great effect. When the crew come across various problems, they don't muck around and have a committee meetings, like they seem to in various other sci-fi disaster films, they do what is necessary, regardless of how it affects the others. This is a very good film, one you should certainly own on DVD or HD, Hollywood doesn't produce many good films recently, but this is one of them, usually repeated on sky movies in the UK a few times a month, worth watching once at least!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story, set in 2057, tells of a team of astronauts from Earth saving the dying sun after a team before them had already failed. The cast involved includes Cillian Murphy (Red Eye) and Chris Evans (Fantastic Four) as well as the brilliant Mark Strong (Stardust). I found this film a little too hard to take in in one sitting, as with other Danny Boyle films. The plot gets a little bit too science-y for the average viewer at times and needs some thinking. At times it gets a little bit too confused for viewer to follow. On top of this, there are some gaping plot holes. Unlike other films of this genre, you don't feel the claustrophobia which loses some of the effect of the film. You feel yourself drawing comparisons to films like 'Alien' and finding that this is somewhat lacking. I find some of the actions of the characters are a wee bit staged and remind you you're watching a film. The characters, at times, do redeem this film somewhat. As they start to turn on each other and argue, you can sympathise with the various individuals. However the illusion doesn't take long to wear off and you're left with a slightly bitter taste and the feeling of it not quite being solved and some greater unanswerable questions being asked. The script feels, well, scripted at times and the conversation doesn't always seem to flow naturally, although there are some witty one liners. It doesn't have the same polished feeling as other films, for instance, I know if I sit down to watch a Tarantino film, I won't be worrying about the script being a bit stiff. I enjoyed this as entertainment, and it did raise an interesting religious debate after Mark Strong's character appears on screen. But as an overall experience, I'd rate this film as average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film which loses its identity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've a strong interest in science-fiction films and even literature, if done well. So, it's to be expected that I would watch this film. What's surprising is that I haven't seen 28 Days Later nor its sequel. So, I found myself with Sunshine, a film I thought had a good chance to surprise me, but didn't. Oh well, I still marginally enjoyed it. Sunshine does actually present an intriguing scientific issue but then falls apart at the end.What first struck me about this film was how isolated it felt. We are shown the crew and almost no other actors (until the end). This didn't detract from the film but it limited its ability to express the necessity of the mission. If we had seen the first ship fail to reach its goal or seen people suffering, we could identify with our heroes more. We would want them to exceed. Oh well, the film wasn't significantly harmed by its inability to express a genuine need for the heroes to succeed. Several science fiction films make this mistake. Almost all of Roland Emmerich's films portray struggle in one city or other place. However, Sunshine did a good job of making its audience focus on the plot; something which few films do anymore. Fortunately, it wasn't because the film was unnecessarily complicated like Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End was. I enjoyed thinking about how the crew positioned the ship to accomplish tasks. Also, the graphics were incredible. Some of the most effective use of CGI that didn't feel cheap or obvious are found here. When Searl dreams of landing on the sun, I felt as if I was really watching him burn and suffer. It was surprisingly realistic and a treat for HD-TV viewers.When they reached the Icarus 1, I felt that the film started to worsen, though not significantly. The process of entering and exploring the Icarus 1 was valid, but the return to the Icarus 2 struck me as very odd. How can people survive with bare skin exposed to space? I don't think they can, but this didn't upset me. What did upset me was how Captain Niece of the Icarus 1 reached the Icarus 2. We never see him during Searle's return from Icarus 1. How did he get on the Icaurus 2? Also, that was where the film started to decline. Captain Niece goes on a killing rampage that seems so out-of-place for this science fiction film. While in Serenity, I had been exposed to violence already, I was unprepared for what was happening. It was like eating a bologna sandwich and tasting peanut butter. It isn't necessarily a bad experience, but an unexpected and annoying one. Furthermore, the film's two heroines, at least to me, felt underused. Cassie and Corazon were little more than supporting characters and victims for Captain Niece. I wish their roles had been expanded. It felt as if they were included out of necessity rather than genuine need. The ending was disjointed and extended beyond necessity. Was the flashback necessary? It didn't add any potency to the film, but it did make it more tedious.Well, I suppose that most will enjoy this film. I did on a limited basis. It started out as a science fiction film and morphed into a generic action-thriller or horror film. If the ending hadn't been so awkward, the I would have rated this film with a near-perfect score. The visuals and the soundtrack are both memorable. So, you should view it, if for nothing more than the two factors I just mentioned. In an era of so few science fiction films, as opposed to fantasy, this one at least fills that hunger most people have after the long time since Serenity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boyle creates yet another entertaining offering to another genre he had yet to explore, just don't go expecting a masterpiece of Sci Fi Cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amidst the ungrown hype of a Sci-Fi movie directed by Danny Boyle, laid doubt. Sure, he did one of the best horror movies in years, but can he do Sci-Fi? All that is answered and more when one views Sunshine. One part Alien, another part clichéd spaceship crew movie, Sunshine delves into the unknown reaches of the galaxy and badly edited action scenes. A crew of scientists embark on a mission to save mankind, by delivering a bomb to the core of the Sun with the hope of igniting it once more and save Earth from certain doom. If you thought Armageddon's plot was ridiculous, then you haven't seen this movie. The script tries to be smarter than the audience, but it just fails. Granted, the dialog by the characters is interesting at times, but the script is still filled with flaws and retarded science that ends up being worse than anything from the Mystery Science Theater (not that much, but you know). On a positive side, the cast in Sunshine is superb. Hiroyuki Sanada (The Twilight Samurai), Chris Evans(Fantastic 4), Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later), Rose Byrne (28 Weeks Later), Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger), Cliff Curtis (Runaway Jury),Benedict Wong and Troy Garity form very good characters, coupled with great acting that really surprised me. The cinematography was nicely done as well as the visual effects, especially the sun effects. And lastly, Underworld. No, not that mediocre vampire movie, but the band. The music by them in this movie is really beautiful, especially the song To Heal, simply amazing. If Boyle edited the film more precisely, making it more clear as to what we are seeing and not some incoherent mess as the third part shows us, the movie may have been slight better. But for what it is, it ain't bad. An entertaining and decent rental, a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best from Boyle but a good(not great) film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is probably the most interesting part about this piece.Cast-wise, it's an electric group. Cillian Murphy gets the starring role, and he's good if not great.Nice work by Michelle Yeoh, Rose Byrne and Cliff Curtis. Not one weak link in the multinational cast.I thought Chris Evans stole the acting honours. A very different role than his Fantastic Four role and this is a good thing. I look forward to see him in better more provocative roles in the future. Despite his character's hot temper, he gave gravitas to every decision, and they included some pretty big ones. He's the pragmatic member of the group; logic's on his side, and he knows it. He's a character that viewers will love and hate.However there is no character development so we don't really care about them. Furthermore, we depend on the fast moving events of the film to get to know the characters but by that time they start to die off.This movie was good for the first two acts, but by the third a horror element was introduced which all in all was extremely risky. To me this was a Sci-Fi drama not a Sci-Fi Horror. But then again I like this surprise twist in plot and genre.However the villain (the horror element) who tries to sabotage the ship like he did for Icarus I, is completely unknown. Who is he? What are his motives? How did he survive the suns rays and his transfer from Icarus I to Icarus II? etc.There should have been more development for this.All of that was introduced with no substance way to fast. This movie should have been an epic 3 1/2 hours to give more time for story.All in all, it was entertaining, it was thought provoking, good score, good acting, its just lacked time for a complex story</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It sounds like a contradiction, but on one hand, "Sunshine" is a must-see with stunning visuals, and on the other hand, it is a failure, albeit a particularly interesting one! The makers were obviously very ambitious: instead of the average SF disaster movie about a big rock hitting the earth, they wanted to get closer to Stanley Kubrick's "2001" than anyone since. Therefore, "Sunshine" is only at first glance a science fiction movie that puts the stress on the word science: the sun activities are well described, and so are the technical means the astronauts need to survive for many months under extreme conditions. Then the mystery and surrealism echoing "2001" set in, though. Members of the crew develop a suicidal fascination with the brightest brightness ever on your screen. Playing god by reigniting the sun seems madness, yet there is another kind of madness to be witnessed, too. And this is what ruins the film (sorry, can't explain this without a *** spoiler now ***). Having a lunatic ex-captain stalking and killing people one after another is OK for a cheap action flick possibly starring Dolph Lundgren or Frank Zagarino. In "Sunshine", this violence is rather a distraction from more interesting elements. In the end, the watcher will be more concerned about Michelle Yeoh being stabbed instead of picking up the philosophical questions. *** End of Spoiler *** Towards the end of the movie, my initial fascination turned into a certain disappointment, as "Sunshine" (similarly to the "Matrix" sequels) gave in to the spectacular show while losing substance. Realism and mysticism are a combination which usually doesn't work. Why did it work for Kubrick then? Because he didn't have to fulfill the expectations of an action movie audience of the 2000s. And isn't a computer deciding to kill people for its protection much more terrible to imagine than yet another crazy killer?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunshine....Danny Boyle Gets Better &amp; Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Sunshine I wasn't sure what to expect as my friends had told me they disliked it, but being a Danny Boyle fan I was looking forward to seeing this. Going by the trailer some may mistaken this to be an action flick which it isn't, its more of a thinking film and plays around with the different characters involved mentally. The visuals are amazing with some fantastic shots of the sun especially the first 10 Min's on the observation deck.Clearly by this film Danny Boyle is not afraid to try his hand at any genre having already done the likes of Trainspotting, The Beach, 28 Days Later all very different films and now Sci-Fi. It would be very interesting to see which direction he goes next as he certainly has enormous talent.I would also like to say that the music score for this movie is amazing and complements the movie perfectly. Although for some reason it is unavailable to buy I can say that it is a collaboration between Underworld and John Murphy.So if you want a sci-fi that is more a thinking than action film then this is the movie for you, you wont be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Believe in the goodness of mankind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine, (10 out of 10)if you don't believe in the goodness of mankind, then this isn't your cup of tea. Because then you are left with just a group of people in a space ship floating around, like you have seen like thousands of time. You must believe that this is more than just bringing a bomb to the sun, because that is basically what the movie is all about. This ship is mankind's last hope. But if you can believe in this, well then this movie is time well spend. I am not particularly a big fan of Boyle, I thought 28 weeks was better than 28 days, but he sure knows how to hold you breath. The story is a little far fetched, but who cares? Like I already said: In short the movie is about a group of scientists and engineers going on a trip to the sun in order to jump start it. I think, Boyle must have watched "alien" over and over again, because he had me sitting at the tip of my chair almost the whole movie. Boyle made sure, that in space still "no one can hear you scream". He succeeds in this by using fantastic camera points and still frames. The camera work is eerie sometimes and the lighting is fantastic, you can feel the heat of the sun as it were. The actors know what is expected of them and they do a hell of job, creating an atmosphere of people confined in a small space, knowing that the future of mankind rests on their shoulders and they know that they have to deal with it, one way or another. Last but not least I must make a complement to Chris Evans (Johnny Storm in Fantastic Four), he manages to create a character completely different of what we have seen from him before and maybe he was the best character of all. At least he is the one that keeps you going. In short the best movie I saw lately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's all been said by now and I'm in the 'tragedy of the third act' camp, but I want to point out sci-fi film has nearly been killed off by all the marvel and DC comic movies in recent years. Sunshine raised the flag for serious sci-fi cinema in the 21stC, so I'm waving a flag for Sunshine.A lot of credit has to go to the cinematographer. I was mainly seduced from the start by the visual beauty of this film, so much so that I wanted to bow down before the messiah and wished for it to take me somewhere worth going. It also succeeds as a 'religious' film, which is an achievement in that I think it's so much harder to be positive and to build something up than to be negative and tear something down.In the end it reveals an old truth, that a film cannot transcend its scriptBut give me something that dared to dream over something safe any day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A welcome return to grown-up SciFi.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Garland described his script as a 'love letter' to the classics, particularly Alien, 2001 and Solaris. Sunshine may not spend as much time pondering but it still has plenty of worthy ideas, and with today's special effects is able to convince the modern moviegoer in a way the oldies, through no fault of their own, struggle to do. As a story, you would be hard pressed to find a more consistently tense, gripping ride.As with the classics, the film uses outer space as a field in which to explore the human subconscious. In this case, a journey to re-ignite the dying sun becomes metaphor for a meeting with our creator. The sun is the source of life and totally ingrained into our very being, what happens when a team of astronauts and scientists get RIGHT UP CLOSE to it? How does the mind cope with such unimaginable power? Have they found God? Science and religion are forced to share a room, where no-one can hear you scream? The film will have you thinking long after the credits roll, and even if the subtler messages are lost on some audiences, the awesome visual rendering of the sun will emblazon itself on any brain. Never before has our burning star been portrayed with such hypnotic beauty; but Boyle also shows us the dark side of the sun ? a savage entity, unkind to man. Sequences which combine this beatific majesty and blood-curdling horror are hard to forget. Special mention should go to John Murphy for his exceptional score in these moments.The actors are completely convincing as the ship's crew, each character is revealed through the various crises that threaten their mission, some overcome their problems, others are destroyed by them. Chris Evans is particularly strong as the hot-headed but logical Mace who develops a grudging respect for Cillian Murphy's sensitive physicist Capa. Hiroyuki Sanada is also excellent as the ship's captain. The heated scientific and moral debates amongst the crew are some of the most effective scenes in the film, and contrast brilliantly with the dreamy visuals of the mostly dialogue-free final act.The tension throughout the story is almost unbearable. Once Garland and Boyle setup the stakes ? the very existence of mankind ? they have us in the palm of their hand. The film wisely starts in media res, just as contact with Earth has been lost, and everything now hinges on this fragile crew in a flimsy ship. Everything that can go wrong does as the filmmakers cook up obstacle after obstacle, it should descend into farce but the credibility of the performances holds everything together, right up to the nail-biting climax, although you'll probably be up to your elbows by then.Sunshine suffered at the box office due to poor marketing and a cinema-going audience increasingly consisting of Attention Deficit Disorder suffering apes, but I hope it becomes the DVD cult classic it deserves to be.</fullReview>

It is a movie with a lot of formulas and a lot of awesome special effects and pretty much emotional soundtrack. The soundtrack reminds me of the Island. The potential makes me think of The Core. Horrors in it reminds me of Event Horizon and Alien. And the special effects which adjoin together with amazing script and acting gives one of the greatest moments in sci-fi history...same with 2001: a space odyssey. Now, let me clarify my point...this movie is not just scientific sleeping pills. It have philosophical meanings behind it. It is right there and all you have to do is go forward and reach the fire. Then it becomes better and better and better. You will love it. It could be in the same level with Mission to Mars (which, to me, is the best in the genre- 2001 is great. But it is quite dated because of it's scene delay. We are all in the hurry but that movie is not- and is on my top list). Just with better special effects and a lot more.Another great SF film with a lot of potential and cool special effects. You would cry (or not). You would fall for it entirely (or not). And you will buy the DVD (or not). 9/10, folks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hoovering up elements of 2001, Solaris, Event Horizon and just about every other "things go wrong in space" movie you can name, Danny Boyle's Sunshine spends most of its running time walking the line between brilliance and a rip off. And for the first hour at least, it's definitely the former. The incredible visuals of the sun provide a startling backdrop to a somber yet surprisingly fast paced adventure, with an intelligent undercurrent throbbing away beneath it all. Shame then that it devolves into a standard stalk and slash horror film in the last thirty minutes, relying solely on the overused cliché of the crew man gone mad.One of the film's great strengths is its interesting premise - astronauts journey through space, hoping to save mankind from icy extinction by re-igniting the sun with a bomb the size of Manhattan. This places the sun at the very heart of the film and what a striking presence it is. Boyle and writer Alex Garland make their reverence for the source of all life very clear, especially in the opening minutes when one of the characters stands enthralled by it. Even when accidents begin to reduce their numbers, the crew are still in thrall and while they may be unpleasant, thanks to the incredible art direction the death scenes might just be the most beautiful ever committed to film.The crew by comparison are thinly sketched. Captain Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada) is a noble hero, Corazon (Michelle Yeoh) an over-enthusiastic botanist, Searle (Cliff Curtis) is really, really clever and so forth. Cillian Murphy and Chris Evans make strong appearances as a pair of men at odds with each other and Rose Byrne does a very decent job as the vulnerable Cassie, but the Sun is definitely the star of the picture. It fills the entire screen, a magnificent orb of power that makes a feast for the eyes, even as it threatens to burn them out.Shame then that the closing thirty minutes jar painfully against the first hour. The initial theme of minor human error leading to horrific consequences and the crew's battle with isolation, stress and personal differences are done away with. Instead of fighting their inner demons, they fight a psychotic killer whose mind has caved in. Even the death scenes change their tone as haunting, dreamlike endings become blood-splattered exercises in on screen viscera.Pity really because two thirds of the film are undeniably strong. The vastness of space contrasts neatly with the enclosed, vulnerable spacecraft and there are numerous shots of the vibrant sun, empty blackness and the lifeless world of Mercury to admire. The soundtrack too is immersing and strong and fits the visual imagery perfectly. Alex Garland just needed to rethink the ending a bit. Find yourself a big Television and a top end surround sound system and you'll be engulfed. As it stands though, Sunshine is just a good movie when it had the potential to be a great one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Piece of Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Sunshine, it's pretty easy to call it a sci-fi piece of art. The movie takes place 50 years from present time, a time when the sun is dying and thus civilization is dying with it. There is one way to save it, however-- by sending a massive bomb into the sun's core, the sun will reignite it and start functioning well again. Sunshine reminds me of The Core, the 2003 sci-fi thriller about the core of the earth failing and bombs re-boosting it. Sunshine is a very gripping and odd movie, hence it being a very good (albeit unsuccessful) sci-fi movie. Too bad Fox totally dropped the ball on marketing (next to nothing in commercials, an extremely low box-office total), because this movie could've been something successful.The cast, although not as diverse as in Aliens, is well acted and each character comes off as being a real person. Humans make mistakes, and director Danny Boyle (28 Weeks Later) knows that. That is one of the reasons as to why this mission to the sun starts to falter and go wrong. But admit it- a director would have to out of his or her way to make a "disaster" movie flop. That's why Boyle takes things many steps further: the ship carrying the team to the sun, Icarus II (stupidly titled if you consider the Greek myth), is a technological wonder with a great build. The way the crew reacts to the sun and the effect the sun has on them is enjoyable. The twists and creepy moments later on in the movie are gripping and clever. Without giving too much away, I should mention that the movie gets very intense and keeps on coming at you until the climax. Sunshine is an example of a brilliantly-paced movie. The good soundtrack helps too. Seriously, do yourself a favor and rent of buy Sunshine when it comes out on DVD.Good) builds strongly to the climax, great mix of sub-genres, nice effects Bad) slightly boring at beginning with a small confounding storyline choice</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for Murphy?and the stunning visuals (it could become a cult film for those alone).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jazz Age glamor boy and literary patron Harry Crosby spoke of aspiring to "a sun-Death into sun." You'll get that in Danny Boyle's hallucinatory sci-fi thriller 'Sunshine'?along with experiencing some of the most gorgeous space visuals ever on the way to it. But if you compare it to Kubrick's 'Space Odyssey,' you'll realize that it's not the quantity of such visuals but how they're used that makes a truly great film. 'Sunshine' hasn't Kubick's extraordinary sense of pace (who does?) and many of the most striking images seem a bit wasted because they're tossed off too quickly or in too chaotic a progression. Nonetheless, this is another "ultimate trip" and for science fiction fans it may be destined for cult status.Yes, as has been said by others, this movie takes strong hints from Tarkovsky's 'Solaris' and 'Silent Running' and from films about a threatened earth. It's not so much notable for originality of design as for sheer, mind-boggling beauty. At some point you just start to forget about the plot details, which are intentionally mysterious when ghostly elements enter toward the end, and just sit back and enjoy the hallucinatory eyeball-popping trip. And Kubrick aside, there are techniques of imaging and editing adeptly used here that were clearly unavailable when 2001 was made. Nerve-wracking suspense and sadness are elements, and so is silliness, but the gorgeousness of a terrific sound and light show is what dominates.There are actors involved though. This is a space mission to save a dying sun by flying close to it with a nuclear bomb payload that will spark it up again so the earth will not succumb to permanent winter. And so there's a crew on board, with Asians and women (no blacks). At the heart of it all is Cillian Murphy, who burst on screen naked and newborn in Boyle's '28 Days Later.' Though that was his 17th film and he has yet to have his great role, he has since become an international star. Murphy is the human key to Sunshine's ethereal and and magical qualities?why, it's hard to say, except that he's a luminous and uncannily relaxed performer with extravagant gifts. It can't be just the striking cheekbones and schoolgirl blush or the liquid blue eyes, but he is special, and he can become anybody, a maniacal terrorist ('Red Eye'), an evil fear-monger ('Batman Begins'), a clumsy hoodlum ('Intermission'), an Irish freedom-fighter ('The Wind that Shakes the Barley'), a bouncy transvestite (''Breakfast on Pluto'). The man has range.And he can play, apparently, a physicist named Capa who's the one indispensable man on this mission to the sun. We can believe that even though he looks more like a schoolboy, because there's a steely passion about him.The story is implausible. What shield could allow a manned space vehicle to fly close to the sun? Why would a crucial mission, the planet's last hope, take a detour when something turns up? How could men shift from pod to ship without space suits? But by the end of it 'Sunshine' has reached a level of the fantastic on which anything can happen, and the visuals make it unimportant. It's only in the early scenes when the whole crew is still together than the dialog seems pedestrian and lame; there's clearly been some bad casting that underlines this fault. The casting director chose Murphy and then went on holiday. But fortunately the visual folks never took a break.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a while since I've seen really good sci-fi. Here's a movie that has seriousness, intensity, intelligence and suspense. I can find faults if I want, but it doesn't matter, the experience was truly worthwhile.Basically, the movie takes place in the future when the Earth has cooled and mankind is in danger of becoming extinct. The sun is dying for some reason and a team of astronauts is sent do deliver a "star-bomb" to help reinvigorate the sun. The movie is about their journey.The setting, visuals, atmosphere and (for the most part) unknown cast members take you into their world so well that you don't know what's going to happen next. I found myself not being able to focus on the "big picture" of the story because I was so involved in what was happening moment to moment.The acting, story and direction are all excellent. It's not perfect - I could quibble with parts of the plot and easy to get lost in exactly what is happening towards the end, but it didn't matter - it it still held the suspense all the way to end.This is a movie worth seeing.</fullReview>

But that remaining 1.5% (anyone who's seen the movie will know immediately to what I refer) is so jarringly out of place, so thoroughly gratuitous and narratively unnecessitated as to completely defy explanation. I'm not sure it mars the movie as a whole beyond redemption (it probably wouldn't have been so jarring if the rest of the film hadn't been so nearly perfect), but I sure as hell wish it hadn't been there.On the whole, I'd still recommend Sunshine to anyone who appreciates deep, moody and atmospheric science fiction ? just steel yourself for a few moments of utter bewilderment.</fullReview>

It also has some elements of horror and suspense that are very neatly woven into the story without going overboard in either direction.

		<fullReview>British director Danny Boyle (of TRAINSPOTTING and 28 DAYS LATER, among others) apparently wants to become the master of all genres. He stretches into the sci-fi territory with SUNSHINE, an on-the-surface brother to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and other intellectual science fiction films. Yet in an effort to appeal to as many sci-fi fans as possible, plot twists taken in the last half of the film propel it to a whole different, disappointing level. When all is said and done, it goes from a thought-provoking metaphorical study piece to a mash-up of a monster movie and Agatha Christie in Space.The film starts off fascinatingly; Boyle's touch for visuals has never been more apparent than it is here. Each frame gleams with a polished coldness, only enhanced by the blinding rays of the sun that peek around every corner. The alienation on board the ship all feels familiar; the crew are nameless faces that, though ably played by its cast, could easily have been recruited from other films. There's even an unemotional computer that they hold conversations with. But while the film is not novel in that respect, its impact is not lessened. Several compelling arguments are made about faith, humanity and the limits of survival. Even as the film nears it close, it manages to retain some of these themes.The major downfall of the film is its second half, when it enters the same horror-movie aspect that played so well in Boyle's earlier film 28 DAYS LATER. The characters are killed off one by one, and it is soon discovered that there is? GASP! An unknown person on board. While the suspense sequences that follow this are filmed with gusto, and are indeed frightening, it is a marked difference from the quiet meditation of the first part of the film. It's as if Boyle and writer Alex Garland knew a great deal of sci-fi fans were going to be put off by the lack of action, and were attempting to make the film as marketable as possible. While this is bound to please some, it turns the film into an unfortunately shallow mash-up of two conflicting sci-fi subgenres: the intellectual and the thriller.Read more at http://newmanscorner.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for Sunshine when I first began reading about it and I am happy to report they were not dashed. Technically superb, the film grabs you from the beginning and never lets up. I felt drained at the end of it and that I am here to tell you is a good feeling. Except for going over the top near the end -- a "spoiler" that some reviewers at the well-known film review site have already given -- the screenplay felt right. Very tight writing that was a joy to behold.In any event, the situation is dire enough without bringing in that extra element, which adds an unneeded and unnecessary element of violence I will not discuss. Stil I almost see why they did it and it is not a major flaw.This is adult SF, the kind that only the English seem capable of making anymore. There is so much to like about this film -- the cast of mostly unknowns is superb, the acting never falters, technically the effects are outstanding. Though borrowing elements from "Silent Running" and "2001," "Sunshine" never feels derivative. There was never a sense that "I've seen this before," which happens all to often these days. There is also a remarkable visual and visceral feel of both what approaching the sun must be like as well as traversing the solar system (Mercury's appearance is darn cool). It's hard for me to imagine anyone checking their watches during this one.Note: I gather the movie premise is based on some actual science -- that a form of strange matter in a "soliton mode" could enter the core of the sun and begin to snuff it out. So there you have it -- the first hard science fiction solar snuff film. The premise doesn't really come into play, however, so just go with it and enjoy the show.Bravo to all concerned and if the Academy ignores this one, for double shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow - you'll never think of the sun the same again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, I am not a movie critic, but I'd like to convey that I went to see the movie with rather low expectations (I did not like "28 days") and I came out deeply impressed. Yes, the ending is very weak and, yes, actual science and the law of physics were not part of the movie.But, the images of the sun, the perfect sound effects, several really thrilling situations made this movie a real, real good one. The situation of the crew, separated only by the heat shield from instant death, is shown so convincingly and accurately, that you can really feel it.So, if you have never gone to the movies to have a sunbath, this is the movie to see. Make sure you bring a sun screen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Belgium, "Sunshine" has been released on 11 April. After reading an interesting article about this movie, I went to the movie theaters with a friend of mine on Friday night because I like the idea of the movie.During the first part of the movie, the plot progresses rather slow compared to most other movies. But then again, "Sunshine" is not like most others.From the beginning, the audience is kept in complete mystery and there is a certain tension. It's not made clear who the main characters are, which is a miss, but slowly it becomes clear who does what on board the ship.Certain highlights are, in my opinion, the tension, the mystery, the visual aspect which really is jaw dropping (both FX, colors and camera-work) and the fitting music.After a while, problems arise and things start to become dramatic. Some incidents are done so that it really gives one the creeps by leaving out music for example, bringing out the dramatic and horrifying feeling.But then, the plot starts to lack originality. I felt that the writer had been inspiring himself too much on other movies, like "Event Horizon". Which is a shame, of course.Also, the cliché of 'heroic' deaths were a bit overdone. By killing off the characters one by one, sometimes in ridicules circumstances, it finally became clear who the leading actors were, even though in the beginning you would think they were not.--- All in all, ["Sunshine"] a good movie that somehow reminded me of "The Island" when thinking of the use of music that fitted nicely with the brilliant images. Which is not a bad thing, of course. And also really showing the realistic, dramatic and horrifying aspects of the space vacuum.Sadly, an interesting idea for a plot for a disaster movie quickly becomes victim of bad(?) writing. At least writing that isn't original. It's like "Deep Impact" (the realistic and dramatic part) meets "Event Horizon" (horror, killing off people).I personally would have liked more dramatic, but interesting storytelling in a manner of "Deep Impact", rather than halfway it's runtime turning it into a horror movie."Sunshine" to me was entertaining enough, but I can imagine people not liking this movie.Personal vote: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing, fascinating, but far from perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine's first hour is an exhaustingly tense affair, mixing classic sci-fi tropes with its own startling ideas and incredible visuals. Backstory is left untold and characters are sketched at a breakneck pace to allow the movie to race on, focusing on the suicidally dangerous situation the crew have placed themselves in and its effect on them all. By the time the film twisted, I felt about as beaten-down as the crew, and there's a respite which finally releases the tension without losing it altogether. Sadly events take a turn for the straightforward at this stage, and the film falls into a plod. While it picks up at the climax, it never completely recovers its freshness, and the ending itself balances on a knife-edge between genuine emotion and triteness.Nevertheless, it's an unforgettable experience, and one which only works on the big screen. The awesomeness and hostility of space has seldom been captured so well, and the soundtrack pushes emotional buttons home when the characters and plot twists don't quite succeed. As a pedantic geek, the best thing I can say about this film is that I was aware of dubious plot points and gross scientific errors throughout, but they were unable break the film's grip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunshine, or the consequences of a closed environment in space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a small category of space films that we could call auteur films. They mostly deal with a subject more or less primary in their respective intrigues : solitude, or entrapment and its consequences(Ridley Scott's Alien is part of it,even if it's a blockbuster, both Solaris films, Kubrick's 2001 of course,as well as less obvious ones (Forbidden Planet, Bava's Planet of the vampires). Sunshine, unfortunately exploits the solitude (and madness as a consequence of it) in a very linear way, and piles up clichés : the distress call of the previous mission, a rogue captain turned into a mystic killer, a suicide mission. But there are other elements that are really worth the ride, the sun presence as a start. Beautifully shot, the sound of it even when it is not seen reminds the viewer of its own eternal presence, and the fact that it is (ironically)dying evokes the characters mortality in many subtle ways.The themes of the limits of science, fatality, bravery as well are all combined in a fast-paced rhythm during the first 45 minutes, but after that Sunshine tends to become a regular (but without being boring that is) space film without surprise. Good points for the visual effects , the characters and intimate scenes left to a minimum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We are all stardust."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After their successful collaborations in 28 Days Later and The Beach, director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland team-up once more in Sunshine, a thought-provoking adventure/sci-fi thriller.Half a century into the future, the Sun is dying, taking Earth along with it. A space mission to jumpstart the Sun fails. Seven years later, another group is sent to finish the mission as Earth's final hope.Unlike other sci-fi movies which immediately feels cold and robotic, distancing you from its characters and usually far-fetched stories, Sunshine's well-cast international team of astronauts and scientists make you care and allows you to suspend your disbelief. Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins, Red Eye), Rose Byrne (Wicker Park, Troy) and Chris Evans (Fantastic Four) provide the requisite eye candy, while Michelle Yeoh and the rest of the Asian cast make the premise more convincing. It starts out sci-fi, but as expected in any Boyle flick, troubles beset our team, and that's when the thrills and creepy subliminal images begin.You must see Sunshine on the big screen with someone, otherwise, you lose out on the stunning visuals and having someone to say "did you see that?" to. The beauty of this movie is that its special effects successfully add to the story and not steal away from it, no matter how many assumptions you will have to take to soak in the story. It can get confusing near the end, but you leave the cinema with a gem of a power line: "We are all stardust." It's just one of those things where you have to have seen it to get it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted this to be amazing.Truly truly i wanted this to be amazing..However it's nothing more than an interesting concept realised as a homage to 'Alien', '2001', 'Dark Side of the Sun' and 'Event Horizon'.I really wanted Boyle and Garland to do something new with the 'small crew in space' genera, but it was just a bit meandering and said nothing that we didn't already know from said other films. It felt as though it wanted to be a dogme-ish hand-held shaky 24 extravaganza but also wanted to capture the foreboding atmosphere of clinically precise and still Kubrick style shots which confused things a bit visually but it did retain the sense of optimistic-peril that was so startling in '28 Days Later'. Could this film really be a way forward for Boyle's developing language? who knows? I'm really looking forward to his next project to see how this hommagy thing effects it.oh and the parts which involved suddenly ranting about religion and the sun and the really burned madman and the hilarious Kylie minogue in concert spacesuits which were just comically bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shines brightly ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this today at the 2:15pm showing, and I saw the trailer and had wanted to see it. The film starts off with a voice slowly stating, "Our sun is dying ...", and we are shown the crew on board Icarus 2, travelling through space, whose mission it is to re-ignite the star by firing an atomic bomb into it. If they fail, that will be the end of mankind and life on our planet as we know it.The film starts on slow, then gradually gathers pace as characters are killed off, and plot twists revealed - I must say, I noticed similarities to a lot of other sci-fi films, but I guess that can't be helped when so many ideas and clichés have been previously used.There are moments of horror, when the aforementioned plot twists are revealed and good acting but my main gripe is the characters aren't as developed and multi-faceted as they could be, but it's still upsetting when their mission is in danger of not being successful.Overall, I thought this was entertaining and the ending had some brilliant visuals and maybe some sort of spiritual meaning. Our main source of light dying on day is plausible, according to scientists and although this film isn't original it's worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable, if a little too long, sci-fi/action/horror movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd seen the trailer for this a few times, and was quiet excited about the prospect of what seemed like the first 'proper' science fiction movie to hit the big screen in a few years.If you've not heard of it, it's a movie directed by Danny Boyle (of 'Trainspotting' fame), which was enough to get me excited as I've really enjoyed his movies so far - and I was particularly interested to see how he was going to handle a full-blown sci-fi opus. It's set in the future where Sol, our beautiful local life-providing star, is dying. The human race has sucked the last remaining natural resources from the earth in order to build a spacecraft to transport a massive bomb to the sun in attempt to reignite it... Of course, it's not plain sailing, but I'm not going to spoil it for you.There's a few 'nods' to the great sci-fi classic '2001: A Space Odyssey' (or, to be more accurate, it's a bit more '2010: The Year We Make Contact'), a gentle sprinkling of 'Silent Running', a little 'Event Horizon' and even a tiny bit of 'Hellraiser' thrown into the mix, so it's hardly completely original. What it is, though, is a perfectly paced, slow burning thriller that delivers nice chunky chunks of sci-fi goodness with a little bit of horror. The acting is solid, with Cillian Murphy proving himself to be a decent lead - and it's interesting to see Michelle Yeoh in a non-kung fu role for a change.I know it's definitely not going to suit everyone's palette, but I really enjoyed this movie and I'd recommend you to go and see it - especially if you're a bit of a sci-fi geek like me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic! So damn underrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Face it! Sunshine is a great sci-fi! You've never seen anything like this before. It's not a typical end-of-the-world movie. Instead of focusing on the panic, screams and devastation down on earth, we follow the 8 crew members on Icarus II; the entire planet's survival rests on their shoulders.What's great about this film, is Boyle's way of creating atmosphere. Like the Mecury scene near the beginning of the movie, were we see a little black dot floating around the sun, while the crew members watches in silence. Combine this scene and John Murphy's incredible score, you'll have the perfect movie-scene.The movie then takes a turn, when tragedy happens, and the mission nearly ends. Nothing I wanna spoil here just watch the movie and experience the fantastic, sad scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boyle provides an artsier take on the sci-fi space thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've never heard of "Sunshine" before or its director Danny Boyle, you probably have one simple and understandably justifiable question: is this another one of those formula space thrillers where people die one by one? The answer is yes...but not exactly. The reason is because "Sunshine" is smarter and more intellectual than any other film where people on a spaceship die one by one, thanks to Danny Boyle.Boyle, most famous for zombie thriller "28 Days Later" shifts to sci-fi for "Sunshine" which is about a crew of astronauts aboard the Icarus II, 50 years from now, on a mission to reignite our solar system's dying sun with an enormous nuclear bomb. The entire film takes place in outer space and the events that unfold are a result of some complications. Perhaps the fact that the ship is the Icarus II is some indication of that. While science skeptics will be quick to jump at the film, the suspense of disbelief comes quite easily and between the writing and producing, the film creates some scientific authenticity in its defense that many similar films don't have.The cast of people dying one-by-one is mostly unknown, though Chris Evans ("Fantastic Four") and Cillian Murphy ("Batman Begins")are a couple of recognizable faces. Evans is actually quite likable whereas that's not so much the case in "Fantastic Four." Since the characters aren't given a backstory, a lot rests on Boyle's shoulders to give the characters some depth and he certainly does that. His attention to eyes and the symbolic idea of the crews' eyes meeting the brightness of the sun brings the plot to level where it is more than just a vehicle to make crazy events happen.While the film most basically addresses the the theme of the individual crew members lives vs. the greater mission of reigniting the sun for all of humanity, there is more going on here. There is a real push of the idea of these characters 'meeting the sun,' as if there is some ultimate confrontation bound to happen that will at the very least have awe-inspiring consequences. It's almost like a science-fiction nerd's allegory for heaven and the afterlife."Sunshine" has the potential to fade out and become just another sci-fi space thriller, but it doesn't because of Boyle. His attention to detail and character and his respect for outer space as being more than just a cool environment for crazy stuff to happen is apparent and worthy of a lot of respect. Here, he demonstrates he is not just a master of suspense, but a master of human drama as it relates to science-fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stellar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine is a near-perfect sci-fi film. It follows the more serious, thought provoking sub-genre of sci-fi, and yet manages to remain gripping, suspenseful and exciting throughout the entire film.The plot deals with the journey of Icarus II and its crew, on their journey to the sun, our star, which is dying. To save mankind from freezing, their mission is to reignite the sun by detonating a stellar bomb within the sun. Will they succeed? Will they survive to return? What sacrifices must they make on their way to complete their mission?Danny Boyle expertly directed an intelligent space-drama, which focuses on moral dilemmas and human conflicts amongst the characters. Thanks to a well crafted script and superb performances by the cast, the film pulls off both the drama and the sci-fi. The film works hard and succeeds at making the science very believable, and yet not complicated or intimidating. The solid performances are very persuasive, and make the characters' conflicts, decisions and struggles seem very plausible and real. And to top all of this, the special effects are truly magnificent. The sun has never been seen this beautiful and mystifying.So why not a perfect score? Because of the ending. Without spoiling anything more, let's just say that the one final element added near the end of the film spoiled this near-perfect film, and was not on-par with the realism of the film and with the intricacy of the rest of the script.But don't let that put you off. It really is a wonderful film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunshine has very strong and impressive pictures. Fantastic. Da capo. Very tasteful.However, it's all CGI. It "only" requires money and a sense of taste to produce stunning effects.The story is the problem! It is not an American movie, so it is not a good and a bad guy fighting for a girl (or treasure or girls and treasures). Yet almost every single element of the movie reminds me of other films.The main plot resembles much Solar Crisis. A pretty intelligent computer being sabotaged has a long heritage in cinema, and none of these machines ever had a backup-system or could seriously protect itself. And none could identify and destroy an intruder! The idiotic contradictions and holes within the storyline are even worse. Everything is immediately burning within the full solar radiation. But on the very sunny side of the star ship is an observation room, which doesn't incinerate right on the spot!? What truly ruins the movie is the monster! OK, they never show the monster directly or without some optical distortions. Good idea! But the monster, which simply is the captain of the first mission, is only a human going berserk so close to the sun. Only the psychologists and the captain of Icarus II give us some very weak explanation for his behaviour. The psychology behind the scenes remains unexplained. The audience is just experiencing another movie-monster (much resembling the original captain of the Event Horizon).Sunshine could have been absolutely beautiful, if it had dared to leave the secure ground of silly SciFi monster movies (doesn't the sequence of getting the bomb finally to explode remind you of alien?) It did not dare. So we are left with fantastic pictures and an idiotic story (much like Supernova).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best science fiction movies I have seen in the past decade. Its with great acting, emotion, and action. The visual effects are stunning. The crew of the Icarus are on a mission to restart the sun with a stellar bomb on the way they experience problems that lead to internal conflict and moral choices. Im not saying this movie is perfect it has it flaws like a lot of movies, but it is really entertaining and emotionally drawing if your a scifi fan. I highly recommend it. I think this movie is underrated. Some people say there are third act problems but I don't see it. If you were isolated for years by yourself wouldn't you go insane?

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend had picked up a copy of Sunshine when it was released on January 8th at Wal-Mart, and after watching it later that day I was fully serious when I asked if I could buy it straight from him right there. I've been working on this entry since then. So many interruptions, a lot of them due to school and work, but mostly it's taken this long simply because anything I write will fail to do justice to the utter brilliance of this film. From director Danny Boyle ? of Trainspotting and 28 Days Later ? Sunshine shows a mission to reignite our dying star and save mankind from global winter. It is a film about the passionate triumph of experiential faith in humanity over irrational faith in God, the theme summed up as concisely as possible. Maybe not; "Humanity" is even more concise.The movie is devoted to the capacity of human experience ? the deep psychological emotions that come from our connections with other people and the physical sensations of wonder and joy and electricity that come from our perceptions of the natural world. Scene after scene is filled with titillating, realistic images of the smoldering red, orange, and black Sun; the crisp dark outline of Mercury as it makes its transit, a stark artistic contrast; the intense white-hot reflection of our star's rays off the enormous gold shield and the precise detail of every simmering hydraulic piece as the craft passes by. It's almost as if Danny Boyle and his film crew set themselves up in stationary orbit around our star ? that's how realistic and vivid the images are. On Earth we see the Sun (every day if you're lucky enough to live in Arizona, sorry guys) as this whitish-yellow ball in the sky, but could you contemplate seeing it from inside the orbit of Mercury? Watching Sunshine is like suddenly coming upon the Grand Canyon for the first time without ever before hearing that it existed. Or like being told your whole life that if you kept going west you would run into a small pond, and then you cross the Cascade mountains and you see an entire freaking ocean spanning out ahead of you ? Sunshine's like that, if the entire scene were bathed in the most appealing shade of gold you can imagine. Just a "Holy Sh*t" kind of feeling.The beginning scenes set up the sheer enormity of the mission, and by themselves they'd be sufficient to categorize Sunshine as a good film, but there is a significant plot change. Stylistically the movie keeps its breathtaking cinematography, but the change allows it to build an argument, pitting faith in humanity against faith in God. With the final scene Boyle proves the argument in favor of the former. I had to consciously remind myself that it was only a movie, and still it made me more proud to be a human animal than I have ever been before.This is all outside of the tremendous acting and perfectly understated score of John Murphy, collaborating with electronic-duo Underworld. All of the scenes where some crew member has to suit up to make a life-threatening spacewalk to fix some integral part of the ship, these really intense scenes, have this softly pounding beat perfectly synched with the actors' breathing.Everybody has read different books, listened to different music, and seen different films. People from other backgrounds can appreciate the movie just for the pure beauty of it, but my experience with this movie has been life-affirming, and I think this is due in large part to my philosophical and artistic progression. Walden Pond and Fahrenheit 451 gave me the passion of Romanticism, John Stuart Mill and John Locke taught me Reason, The Fountainhead brought me to respect and seek excellence, and I can attest to the fact that Daft Punk at Lollapalooza was truly a crash course in the power of humanity. Sunshine has been the latest step in my personal philosophy.I could watch this movie on a wristwatch and love it; it's my favorite film. But I've got some suggestions. To prepare for this film, clear your schedule, gather some good friends, and plant yourselves in front of the biggest screen you can find. You will be enraptured.For people whose conception of film is so wrapped around the idea of neatly categorized genres with rigidly formulaic plot structures, Sunshine might be considered a poor slasher film or a mediocre science fiction film when they try to classify the movie. Those people don't matter. Yes, there is one glaring plot hole - it isn't explained how the spacecraft has gravity. This could have been remedied, but it wasn't. It might have made the film more cluttered if this was elaborately explained, taking away from the understated and quietly intense tone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had potential, but fell on its face due to the poor lighting and special effects. I'm convinced it was done on such a low budget that filming in darkness hides the necessity for believable background.The spacewalk scene is an example. The characters can only see out a slit in their suit and just what were they doing out there? This whole scene is just an old example of playing on man's fear of being lost outside in space.The end result is a movie that you keep saying to yourself, "What am I seeing?" and "What is going on?".There is really no character development in the movie so it is difficult to place yourself in the story. You tend to watch it as an exercise in how these 8 handle multiply crisises. In summary, there are much better ways to waste 2 hours of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The more Danny Boyle films I see, the more he moves up my "worst directors" list. I didn't think Trainspotting was anything spectacular, I hated 28 Days Later, and I hated Sunshine. Of course, three films out of eight (not including his television work) isn't enough to put him at the top of the worst directors list, but it's enough to make me dread seeing any more of his films.Sunshine seems like a low budget independent film. Most of it looks bad--the cinematography, most of the special effects, the stuff that we're supposed to think is in space and not models. The performances tend to come across as slightly above amateur. The dialogue is often ridiculous, insular and jargony. Boyle directs his cast (or lets them, at least) to act pretentiously serious and melodramatic. All of the above are actually problems with all of the Boyle films I've seen to date.But the biggest problem is that Boyle simply does not know how to tell a story here. Too much is unexplained. Too much is just skipped. Too much is like a bad acid trip (with an emphasis on bad).As sci-fi, Sunshine doesn't have much to do with real-world science. Now, as fiction, I don't think that it has to have much to do with real-world science. But if it's going to have fictional world science, it needs to give us some grounding on what the "rules" of the fictional world are. Otherwise we're just in the dark, and events are more or less random. Of course, you could take Sunshine as more of an impressionistic work commenting on things like science vs. religion or commenting on man's obsession with everything from sun worship to authority, control, collecting/hording, ideologies, etc., but the problem is that it's not very satisfactory on those more abstract levels, either, and it's also too loaded down with techie jargon and plot developments to work on that level.</fullReview>

Of course, the touching the sun, guy from prior spacecraft surviving and mutating, etc., all this is pretty stretched as far as I see it. Worst of all is the degeneration into the standard monster movie. I guess Hollywood is incapable of any imagination lately and all scifi movies end up as pseudo-horror flicks - not much horror though given the one not-so-intimidating villain. Take a page from Space Odyssey or Solaris please and get some real scifi done. Thankfully I decided to get some work done while watching this movie. So I can't say I wasted my time.</fullReview>

It left no real impression on me besides how claustrophobic space is, and how annoying and irritating much of the camera work is throughout the last half of the movie. So let's do a quick n' dirty summary, then we'll get back to that.All right, a few astronauts go into space (50 years beyond our present time) to drop a nuclear payload into the sun, which is dying a few billion years ahead of schedule. Mistakes are made, part of the ship is damaged, and they find out the first ship sent out to complete their current mission is still floating around. They finally go to check it out to see if anything's still salvageable, since their ship doesn't have enough oxygen since their hydroponic bays were torched during one of the early rounds of mistakes. "Somehow", the only remaining member of the original crew slips aboard the main ship (going from Icarus I to Icarus II), and starts killing people and generally trying to sabotage their ship and scuttle the mission, since "god said so." Bad guy ends up failing, the payload is delivered, but everybody dies and the sun is re-lit and the Earth is saved. Yay.Okay, now that that's out of the way, let's go through the problems with this film: - Little character development, though I've honestly seen much worse.- The lack of supernatural events or aliens led them to turn this into a slasher flick.- If you've got any common sense at all, you'll spot the technical issues with this. Definitely has a few "bwah?" moments, and otherwise spots where some characters barely survive a situation, but later on other characters doing the same or more are fine.- Gratuitous gore with no point, especially when Cassie (one of the 'nauts on Icarus II) rips the flesh off the baddies' arm. Yuck. Though admittedly, the 'naut who drifts off into space and freezes, begins to break apart, and then is fried to a crispy critter by the sun was pretty cool.- Oh yea, almost forgot the camera work. I have no idea what feelings or atmosphere they were trying to inspire with this, but it SUCKED. You never get a clear view of the killer, as immediately after he comes on the screen (which happens quite a few times), it's almost as if someone both put the camera out of focus and was shaking it violently. It happens more and more as the film goes on, and I almost didn't finish the movie because of it. It's so bad that even if the film was better, I'd just about not recommend it JUST for this.The good parts: - Like I mentioned at the top, the feeling of claustrophobia was pretty well done, and definitely made me question just how well I'd do in space.- The space landscape shots are generally awe-inspiring and gorgeous.- It had a few fun scenes, admittedly.Bottom line - if you've just about exhausted anything you've ever wanted to see and need something to fill your netflix que, there are quite a few films worse than this. However, keep in mind that it made very little in the way of box office receipts, and there's a reason for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have avoid signing up with IMDb to add a comment. However, this movie needs a warning. Usually, IMDb ratings above 7 are fail safe to be a good movie, if perhaps not my taste. This movie is rated above 7 right now. It left me puzzled to its point. And, comments of other reviewers show that I am not alone.*** WARNING SPOILERS *** There are lots of shots of the sun and the spaceship. If you like the eerie feeling of drifting through quietness, vast space, and a shining sun, hey the movie is for you.If you need a bit more like characters or action or plot, you may be sorely disappointed.- The actors are kind of cute, but the movie doesn't provide an opportunity to fall in love with them.- There is kind of an action going on, yet, it is always in little pieces that leave little suspense.- Half way through the movie, I figured, hey maybe this is just a quiet backdrop for a really gory horror act to start later. The horror act is a joke.- At one point, there are weird flashes in the camera that suggest something supernatural. However, that is never further explained and stops on its own.The movie left me hanging, what does the director want me to really enjoy or pay attention to? There is this thing, where the movie tries to avoid having heroes. It avoids stereotypes for macho behavior. It actually works hard to avoid a lot of stereotypes. However, it doesn't offer anything new and interesting.In regards to art movie, yes, there are many themes like saving the world from its end (dying sun = global warming), religion (the slasher in the end) vs. science. Yet, none of those themes are developed to put a new point out.So, in the end, it is a movie of watching gold and sun animation in space. If you like those movies, you may like this one. For me, adding a George Clooney butt or Jessica Alba boob may have been required :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's nothing new under, or in, the Sun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few months ago, the film's producer, Andrew MacDonald, appeared on the Fox Movie Channel's "Life After Film School" series, plugging "Sunshine." He kept harping on the fact that "Sunshine" was the first movie in which the characters "go to the Sun," but was notable in his failure to say that the drama was emotionally moving or relevant.Beyond his ignoring that that's the whole reason to make a piece of drama, Mr MacDonald also failed to note that, four years earlier, Paramount had released a film called "The Core." It was a well-made film, with a top-notch cast (and, at some point, its own producer may have gone on television to brag that it was the first film to ever go to the center of the earth, though that claim, obviously, wouldn't have been true), and didn't make any money."Sunshine" and "The Core" are the same bloody story, Mr MacDonald (minor variances in plot notwithstanding)! The center of the Earth, or the inside of the Sun, what does it matter? Well, it doesn't.Frankly, I don't even remember "Sunshine"'s ever being released (I had to look up when it hit theaters to even confirm that it had been), and imagine that audiences felt the same way. They stayed away from "The Core," and they avoided "Sunshine." When will producers and studios learn from the mistakes of others?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***This comment DOES contain spoilers; my word, yes*** Ah, the burdens of family at Christmas! I gave my little bruv a copy of 'Blazing Saddles' (qv), and he returned the favour with a copy of 'Sunshine', backed up with the most heartfelt plea I have ever witnessed from him: 'give it a chance and see what you think.' Of course, that kind of heart-tugging will always make me narrow my eyes in suspicion but, eight hours later, my lids have finally shut from despair, not intense insolation.I won't carp on about the physics of the movie; I have long accepted the pervasive nature of narrativium (qv) in story-telling, so I won't bother to compare the rules of my universe with those of Alex Garland's. Nor should I fault the professionalism of the cast and crew; I was particularly taken with Benedict Wong's portrayal of despair following Trey's erroneous course correction. Obviously then, what is left to complain about is the plot: why in the name of Nebuchadnezzar's nob-end did Garland and Boyle introduce Captain Pinbacker? Some space-based movies excel at the ambiguous mentality of the characters; think, for example of Hal 9000's dilemma in '2001: A Space Odyssey' or Chris Kelvin's entire approach in 'Solaris'. The premise of 'Sunshine' and the characters' reaction to it, were already well established in the first fifteen minutes, in which a fading Sun is also deadly up close, and crew members are both logical scientists and stir-crazy kids.There was also so much believable menace in the threat of oxygen depletion; the exchange with Mace and Cassie during the debate about whether to euthanise Trey to maintain oxygen levels was very promising; there was enough ambiguity in the characters for that alone to be a thrill. When Corazon furtively introduced the subject of oxygen and crew numbers, I was reasonably excited about the prospect of the helionauts turning on each other in a desperate fight to survive (for the good of the mission, naturally...).Again, Harvey's weaselly arrogance, Mace's logic and Dr Searle's nobility during the escape from the 'Icarus 1' was an excellent starting point for tension; no more ingredients were needed to turn that scene into a frightening examination of human nature.So why the need to incarnate threat with the 'daemon ex machina' of the bead-jiggling Pinbacker, a hopeless zombie of a McGuffin? I can only presume that it was a result of the 'Peoria' lobby at Fox, although I am deeply disappointed that Garland and Boyle listened to their pleas.I praised the professionalism of the cast and crew earlier, but I have to condemn everybody for the final ten minutes, as Capa drives the bomb into the Sun. The ending had the same devotion to nasty eye-wrenching post-production tricks that made me walk out of '28 Weeks Later' half an hour after the lights went down. In the case of 'Sunshine' an already moribund story was quickly despatched by a hastily-edited SFX-heavy climax. It was not needed; Capa and Cassie should have been allowed to meet the surface of the Sun in long slow takes, allowing us time to get inside their heads as they sacrificed themselves.I have a habit of walking out of movies; these days, I count a movie as good if I stay to watch the end: if it wasn't for the fact that I was watching 'Sunshine' on a free DVD in the comfort of my own armchair, I would have raced to the box office for a refund. Why? Life's too short; there are many more stories to follow just by meeting people on the street. That's what 'Sunshine' should have concentrated on all the way through to the end: people. I have to be honest: I hate movies; I love stories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's imagine for a second that in the next Rambo, John pierces tank armors by throwing strawberries at them, then uses one cup of water to fuel a flamethrower for ten uninterrupted days ... ridiculous ?Well, if you cannot accept such minor inconsistencies, do not bother with this movie.Sunshine is about a team of lemming-brained "scientists" doing the stupidest things possible to solve the most ridiculous problems possible in space, in order to save humanity. We are doomed.On a positive note : the images and special effects are very nice and the acting is OK.*** Massive Spoilers Follows ***I know that there are still people out there thinking Earth is a flat disk standing on a turtle but ... please.Year 2057 : declining sun ?There are a few basic facts about Earth and the Sun available to anyone: The Sun will burn for the next five billion years. When the sun will age (having burned many times Earth's mass in combustible), its temperature will raise then it will expand up to Earth's orbit. It will not be colder.A bomb made of all nuclear stuff from Earth to cure the Sun ? Make a big burning flame because there is not enough gas anymore ? How clever ! If a fire goes off use a flamer on it, it will help. (Do not even bother to think adding combustible. Thinking is overrated, especially if your fate depends of your next move).Let's speak about dimensions. Sun is B.I.G. : diameter is more than 100 times Earth's and mass is more than 300000 times Earth's. So their big "stellar bomb" sure has got a pretty name but it would be the flare of a matchstick compared to a forest-fire.Basic Safety ? Ever heard of redundancy or basic security ? Co-pilots ? After all it's only the last hope of humanity. Let's put it all into one computer and let's one man handle the ship alone. So he will he able to ruin everything.Doomed from start ? Hey, we have only one bomb and we just found the where the last failed mission is (status unknown). Maybe it's the time to tell we are not so sure anymore we have a good chance of success.Let's take more risk ! Change trajectory, head for the last doomed mission just in case the 7-year old bloody ship is flyable and has got a bomb. They launched a critical mission without ensuring more than 45% chances of success ? Anyone though that, maybe, a rescue mission could have been sent later to recover the first bomb (just in case those brain dead apes are able to learn anything from the first try, if it fails) ?Space Zombies ? A man irradiated and burned to a crisp cannot survive 7 years, let alone move or overpower a team of "sane" ones (Is it a "Horror" or "clueless-fiction" movie ? Both ?).Fight fire with fire ? Fire on a critical combustible area ? Hurray : let's feed it pure oxygen, it will burn faster so the fire will destroy everything and stop sooner. (I though that even a teenager know that vacuum would have put the fire out instantly. Space, outside, anyone ? Has any scientist in here got any basic knowledge about anything ?)*** End of Spoilers ***Then again it's not as bad as "Queen of the Damned".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film falls short where it really counts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen this movie a few days ago, and I am a very big Sci-Fi fan. Well, let's begin with the cast, a perfectly fine area, but some of the portrayals left me wanting more emotion and depth. Next is the script. I found it a very ballsy move to jump straight in without any background or connection to the characters, but the film fails to deliver anymore on the characters or the back story. The visuals are stunning, however, fifteen minutes in I was feeling like that was the only thing the director focused on. When they find the Icarus 1, I had noticed that the director had changed his focus to slasher horror instead of Science Fiction. The ending ,while poetic, offered little in the way of closure or satisfaction. Personally the film is just a further example of how cinema today is losing touch with good story lines and originality. If you're looking for a great sci-fi film, leave this movie alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was an entirely different movie spliced into the end?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to enjoy this movie -- Danny Boyle is a man to watch, and my initial impressions of the movie were somewhere akin to Solaris and 2001. As I watched, the movie did not disappoint -- the visuals were sumptuous, the cast was acceptable, and the technology, while not 100% convincing, was interesting enough for me to shrug off inconsistencies and buy into the film's atmosphere.Just as it was languorously drawing to its conclusion, the movie took a jarring turn near the climax which angered me, not so much because of its stupidity (which it had in excess) but because it completely sabotaged the flow of the previous 3/4 of the plot.Some have complained the characters were shallow, the plot was full of clichés -- for me the movie was beautiful and interesting enough for me to follow, but the finale was a great disservice as the pacing, atmosphere, and message changed. The editing became horribly blurred and confusing, and the main character made a couple of idiotic decisions, decisions familiar to any main character in a horror movie. And make no mistake: at this point the movie had degenerated into a shameful slasher pic.Whether or not the movie was a masterpiece or pretentious preening, the ending was utterly at odds with whatever it had been trying to establish previously. I can pinpoint for you the exact moment when the movie completely derailed, and I'll bet just about any viewer could as well. Why couldn't the author? The director? The producers?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll make this brief, I just wanted to give my opinion on this film after just watching it.The film was slow to get going, had little in the way of storyline but had very nice visuals and audio. The visuals it seemed were the best part of the film. Although nice to look at I found them to be confusing due to being fast 'flick screen' images that didn't give you a clear idea of the 'environment' or concept of what was actually occurring on screen.I was expecting better things as the film got a bit quicker in pace but just ended up being a string of unfortunate 'sods law' incidents with nice but shaky visuals until there was one chap left.And like others on IMDb, I questioned the concept of a dying Sun in a very near future.In summary: Nice visuals but they overwhelmingly cloud your perception of the scenes. Good audio with nice music and sound effects. Weak and disappointing plot. Science buffs will find many flies to pick.Basically a 'fire and forget' movie. Probably won't watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watch Danny Boyles movies almost reluctantly. I enjoy them, but they always tend to leave me with a sensation. When i saw the trailer for "Sunshine" i knew i had to see it. Danny Boyle is nothing if not visionary, and i knew that his take on the sci-fi genre would be something out of the ordinary.Someone called this "The "2001" of 2007", meaning of course Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey". And granted, there are similarities. Not least in the way that the movie layers between what is obvious (a spaceship on an important mission) and what lies beneath it all. Most of the similarities end there as Kubrick strayed a lot further from conventional film-making than Boyle has. In the end though this movie had a much bigger emotional impact on me. I have never really understood "2001" or it's greatness. Mostly it just raises yawns from me. I guess a child of the MTV-generation needs more than 3 hours of classical music to be touched.I mentioned my admiration for Boyle right at the beginning of this review. But while i find him to be truly talented i also find him to be one of those directors who imbue their movies with inherent flaws. Boyle has themes that pass through all his movies like a common denominator. Sometimes obvious, sometimes less so, but always present. Boyles most apparent flaw here is his ever-present fatalism. It sinks down like a wet blanket as early as fifteen minutes into the movie. But let's discuss the positive things first.What you can see is easy to notice. The visuals here are astounding. The sun is a beautiful golden yellow and the space ship is exceptionally constructed. In the first half of the movie, almost every frame is like a painted picture. The second thing is the acting. I really liked the collected ensemble of actors. With so few actors involved it's incredibly important that they all work well, and they did. Thirdly i loved the ambition of this movie. It works on a grand scale. I'm not saying it works all the way or that it reaches the point where it wants to be. But i still admire the effort.Now, getting down to the negative things is a lot harder. This movie is very openly and evidently flawed in many ways. From the obvious stolen plot lines ("2001", "Solaris" etc.) to the way the movie almost turns into a slasher-flick at one point. I mentioned ambition in the previous paragraph and the ambition is painfully obvious when the movie fails. The film-makers want to get their message across to the point where it almost cramps up for them. Too much ambition can be like a ton of bricks weighing a movie down. A more simple plot line without the action-scenes and ever-present threats could have been even more effective. I said above that Boyle always carries his fatalism around and unfortunately that often leads to violent scenes where fate is swift and merciless. I would have preferred it more low-key.Danny Boyle is a merciless film-maker in more ways than one. There are no fairy-tale endings or smiling faces at the end of his movies. At least not in the way that most of Hollywood usually serves up. Usually though there is a small spark of hope. Hope for life maybe? This movie is far from perfect, but at least it made me think. And that makes the whole thing worth while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Big Question</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read a lot of the previous comments regarding Sunshine's ending, for me the whole premise is that the universe, not just our sun, is dying and there is nothing we can do to stop it. Eventually (and yes it is a few years away) everything living thing in the universe will die out. The point of sunshine is that Pinbacker has realised this fact having spent 7 years staring into what gives our planet life, is this our God? and if so he has doomed us all. That is enough to drive anyone mad. To me this is a beautiful insanity, is the human race really worth saving and if so what for?. That's the ultimate question!. Oh and the "dumb" name for the ship, I think it only serves to remind the crew that if the advice of the scientist(ie Icarus's Father) is ignored the consequences can be fatal. All-together Sunshine is a beautiful film the last scene with Capa is simply stunning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly One of the Most Powerful Space Films of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films go misunderstood and some are deserved critical and commercial failures, and then there are some like Sunshine, which is neither. What it is is one of those flukes that occurs every so often when you'll wonder why a great movie isn't doing so well and you look to the critics, and even though many liked it, the ones who didn't have suddenly turned into dumb genre fan preteens that were simply bored by its intellectual capacity. A good quarter of the reviews were these sorts of negatives, save for one negative critic who did suddenly take that form and instead snootily claimed that Danny Boyle has not made a space movie that embraces the genre but rather an artsy fartsy attempt at rising above it as if he were not worthy of it. None of this is true at all of this dazzling, arresting gem of a movie.Boyle has fashioned a film of such intensity that it transcends what Roger Ebert calls a "bruised forearm picture," which a movie with such agonizing suspense and tension that your date is gripping your forearm so tightly that by the end, it's all black and blue. The film's claustrophobic, far-from-home atmosphere, the terrifying potential outcome behind nearly every situation, and the risks that it takes in its character drama tightly wind up into a movie that feels so different, unearthly, and charismatically eery. It's also the only special effects film in the past few years that really dazzles me. Why the commercial failure? The disturbing and sometimes horrifying effects of the sun have so much more power than any recent blockbuster.Alex Garland's script never takes the easy way out. Storywise, its early turns are those of very new and thought-provoking matters that one would only imagine a space crew dreaming up. Its later turns are those of a very original villainous force of powerhouse imagination that dually says something very frightening about human beings. The climax does not fall apart as some have said. What it does is reach for something so far beyond any experience or finality any creature from earth has ever known that it's almost abstract. There are other subplot creations such as the observation lounge, a room where passengers can view the sun in a sort of CinemaScope fashion as the ship journeys towards it. There are levels at which the full blast of the sunshine can be viewed, and beyond a certain surprisingly low level, irreversible damage can be caused to the retinas. The organic garden, passionately preserved by Michelle Yeoh's character, maintains the oxygen level of the ship. So much is made of these things.This is one of Cillian Murphy's sparest performances, perhaps the most. As the film's hero, a cool, timid physicist, he serves a very contained, very quiet wildness, giving the character an interesting and subtle duality. I have never been impressed with a Chris Evans role, however. Whether the movie is good, like Cellular, or bad, like Fantastic Four or The Perfect Score, his role is always that of the cocky Gen-Y jock high schooler. I hate going to the movies to see those kinds of people, but here, Evans really shows his true colors in a juicy, aggressive role. Cliff Curtis, Troy Garity, and Rose Byrne are the other highlights of the cast, especially Curtis, who plays all the right notes as a character whose innocent fascination with the sun reaches a roof-shattering point of bravery.Sunshine is certainly one of the most powerful space films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: Our sun is going out. 8 multi-ethnic crew members are sent on a mission in a ship steering "all of the world's remaining fission material" on a crash course with the sun in an attempt to reboot it. This sets the stage for a lot of pretty shots of the sun, light, contrasting color, and a few inspired scenes. (The gold suits were particularly cool). Naturally, crew tension amps up as oxygen runs short, mistakes jeopardize the mission, and certain folks turn a bit weird....Sunshine starts out promising, with the screw-ups, natural tension, and crew drama propelling this silly but pretty sci-fi flick. The acting is serviceable and the sparse music does its job. Somewhere along the line, the scriptwriter thought the introduction of an Event Horizon / Cube style bogeyman would spice things up. It doesn't, and turns an otherwise interesting film into yet another boring "Which crew members will survive and will they complete their mission?" film.The cinematography is well done, and lifts heavily from 2001 and Blade Runner. But the film falters in the final third and loses touch with the audience (or at least myself) and in the process also jettisons a lot of what makes this film interesting in the first place.Worth a look if you like the premise, just don't expect greatness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pity About The Last Third Of The Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening pulls you into this gripping yarn slowly; you are told that earth is in the grip of an ice age due to the sun having reached the end of its life although you are never given the reason? The 8 intrepid heroes who are going to save the world with a gigantic Payload (bomb) all have their own individual eclectic ways about them, some you will love others you will take an instant dislike too.The first two thirds of the film go along quite nicely, everywhere is dark and menacing and you're never sure what is going to happen. There are no shootouts and the dialogue doesn't disappoint with sloppy regurgitated sci-fi chit chat.The cinematography is good and the sets are realistic without having to go over the top to be futuristic. There are not that many opportunities to get to know the characters but I suppose that is not really needed.When I watched this film I found myself attributing various elements and scenes to other films e.g. 2001, Alien and Event Horizon, don't be put off by that because other films borrow so readily.There are elements of all sci-fi films where you have to suspend belief, however the last third of the films asks you to take a step too far into fantasy, leaving you rather perplexed as to how a film that had real potential had one of its wheels fall and ruin a perfectly good story.The ending left me asking questions on so many levels, for example, how did the payload have oxygen after Capa opens a hatch and let all the oxygen out earlier.What was with all the blurry footage at the end, and how did Freddy Kruger get on board? The film is worth watching but get it on rental</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the start of Sunshine, it had good special effects and shots of space and the huge spaceship. I can forgive the ripoff of Hal from 2001 in the computer voice used with the only difference being the calm, god computer voice played by a female.At the start the movie is interesting and lays out a good plot and shows various characters that have quirks and differing personalities that clash, with some decent acting mostly, with just a couple off key performances.I especially liked the Captain character played by an Asian actor, he had a good mix of a calm professional who wanted the mission completed but at the same time felt protective of his crew.The movie started go downhill for me when the Captain was killed off, and then shortly after that more characters started dying one by one like a horror film.The secret stalker/killer character ruined the movie in my opinion, it didn't make any sense and seemed to be jigsawed in and didn't fit the tone of the movie.There could have been so much better of a storyline with no serial killer on the loose, why not more drama between the various characters? The setup of the movie hinted at this, but then dropped the ball. A great opportunity missed.I will be generous with a 6 rating because sci-fi is sadly neglected nowadays and even a mediocre sc-fi movie is a nice change of pace from Hollywood.</fullReview>

What's the point of that? What is that trying to say? I despise the idea that he might be "super-natural", that's just sick, so why should he have an aura of fuzzy air around him? There's plenty of other places where the camera is not showing the events happening properly. It's way too easy to lose track of location in a place which was no doubt built with "perfect sense of orientation" in mind. Why are the shots jumping from area to area without introducing the ship to us properly?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danny Boyle is one of my favorite directors ever since his first global success: Trainspotting in 1996, in which Ewan McGregor was introduced. He continues to make films of a different genre, from horror ( 28 Days Later ) to kid story ( Millions ). Together with one of my favorites authors Alex Garland, they both collaborated into putting into Garland's awesome novel The Beach and the result was a half-baked film toned down by the casting of All American Boy Leonardo DiCaprio as the main character which was originally a Brit. They redeemed themselves however with Sunshine, their second collaboration. Boyle has entered another genre, science fiction dosed with a little horror reminisce of 28 Days Later. Great premise: the sun is dying, a scientist devised a machine/bomb that would reignite the fading star, a mission was sent however there's trouble ahead. Good writing by Garland, an excellent international cast headed by Irish Cillian Murphy ( Batman Begins, Red Eye ), Malaysian Michelle Yeoh, and a surprisingly good Chris Evans ( Cellular, Fantastic Four ) made this film a must see for me and I wasn't disappointed. This film won't open in the US till September 14 and therefore I was fortunate enough to be here in the Philippines when the film opened last easter weekend. This is not your typical sci-fi popcorn flick like Armagedon. This is the thinking man's sci-fi film. I won't be surprised if it's gonna be a big hit in the US once the American audiences watch this gem of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn you Kubrick, and thank you Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine is quite an impressive feat by director Danny Boyle. It is rare these days to see a sci-fi movie that takes its characters and its themes seriously. I for one am grateful that once in a while a director pops up who is willing to break new ground (or perhaps old is more appropriate) at the risk of offending casual sci-fi action buffs. Sunhsine, as it has been mentioned so many times, incorporates some of the best elements from movies such as Alien, Event horizon, and 2001. The heavy inspiration from such movies ensure that the general focus of the movie is just right. The action is not the main attraction, rather the psychological and visual elements are brought in to play (and does, to be fair, play the biggest role in the movie). Boyle brilliantly conveys the feeling of loneliness, claustrophobia, and paranoia that the crew aboard the Icarus II is experiencing along the ride. The soundtrack and visual effects, centered around the constant glow and peril of the dying sun, immerses you totally during the movie and for a long time after. besides that I found the movie to be terrifically frightening for the first hour and it stayed with me for a long time after wards. The heavy reliance on 2001 does not come without at price however. The last part of the movie gets much to metaphysical for my personal taste, and I simply cannot understand why Boyle did not just finish the movie in the same manner as the wonderful first hour. Everything becomes blurred towards the end and it is difficult to even understand which part of the spaceship we are in. I understand that the ending is meant to express the inexpressible experience of returning to our origin, and coming to odds with our own mortality, but it could have been done much plainer with much greater effect. All in all a highly commendable experience if you enjoy intelligent and visionary sci-fi, if only the ending was a little better...high hopes for the directors cut then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A (very slightly) flawed masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that has to watched and evaluated in its own terms. It is unfair to judge it against the expectations or conventions of this or that genre. It is not sci-fi; it is not horror; it is not an action-pic. If you expect any of these, or measure it against the classics of those genres you will be disappointed I imagine. It does borrow and reference certainly (but it does so knowingly and to its own end)...The film is more about psychology, theology and metaphysics. It is about the relationship between the inconceivably vast and the micro-cosmically small; it is about the nature of sacrifice; it is about human fallibility; it is about both the significance and insignificance of who we are and what we do...The plot is circumstantial... for that reason, it matters little that the sun will not be dying in 50 years time, that it is rather unlikely a large nuclear payload would somehow restart it, or that it is unlikely a single manned-ship would be sent on such a mission... The film is believable in its own terms and characters take precedence over plot (a refreshing reversal compared to most films).(Warning - spoilers) For me, the film was really about the nature of sacrifice. All the key moments revolve around an individual or collective attitude towards the sacrifice of self or others. The decision to continue, knowing they will not return; the decision to kill one crew-member to ensure enough oxygen for the remaining crew to complete the mission; the suicide of that very same crew-member; the captain's self-sacrifice to complete the maintenance; the second-in-command's attempt to save himself; the psych-officer's decision to remain behind on the damaged first vessel... and so on...And all of it underpinned by stunning cinematography and a perfectly attuned soundtrack... A film that demands something of its viewer...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, being a bit of an SF fan (and a Cillian Murphy fan), I'd been looking forward to seeing this movie for quite a while and, as you can doubtless tell from the score I've given it, it pretty much lived up to my hopes. I've always loved a bit of heavy duty, outer-space hard-ish SF and they don't make a huge number of films in the genre, really, so when they do, and it's as gorgeous and well made as this, it's something to relish. Sure, as has been mentioned in a number of places, there are some really daft elements, like the slowish start, not having multiple redundancy on pretty much all of the ship's systems, not being able to rely on the thrill ride that is man's endeavours against the hostility of space and instead having to introduce the typical "man gone mad and wanting to kill everyone" thing, plus the look on Cillian's face as he breathes his last and the final scene with the sister, which is a wee bit too long, and indeed, the concept of the sun going wrong as suggested in the movie is stretching the truth perhaps a tad (and I've done a wee bit of your hardcore, actually-in-a-lab astrophysics research, so I speak with a certain amount of knowledge), but those things aside, there is much here to like - I was very fond of how the crew reacted to watching the transit of Mercury, the distress signal of the Icarus 1 was wonderfully haunting, the characters were totally in the prosaic, Arthur C Clarke mould (no surprises there, though) and every shot that showed something at a distance with the inferno of the sun as its background was absolutely, without doubt, the most gorgeous thing I've seen in the cinema for years. And pretty much everyone who died did so magnificently - I was most impressed. True, this film could have been better, in some cases much better, but as an overall package I left thoroughly satisfied, hence my high mark. If you're into SF, I utterly recommend it (if you can overlook its occasional glaring stupidity). If you don't, well, you might be able to think it's just about okay.</fullReview>

No one in the audience could make anything of this and no one was saying wow, either. There is zero character development, I had trouble telling one character from another.The crew decides to divert the mission to pick up an extra bomb from a previous failed mission. More sparkles. The old crew is baked, but the old ship seems habitable. No explanation of this, but lots of sparkles.After about an 60 or 80 minutes of sparkles and meaningless drivel of dialog, a monster with super human powers (from the sun, no doubt) shows up and starts killing people. Then more sparkles and a few things blow up. If you liked this movie, you should get yourself a rocking chair, a kaleidoscope and a six pack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danny Boyle is a hack. There, I said it. 28 Days Later was horribly overrated and this film just proves that Boyle's success is a fluke. HORRIBLE sci-fi flick. I love me some science fiction, and this just nauseated me. The plot is interesting enough, but the characters are bland and uninteresting. The film moves slowly along for the first hour. I was completely uninterested. The film doesn't look bad, but when there's nothing going on, the background just seems to blend in with all of the other blandness the film offers. The last half hour is just a pathetic rip off of Event Horizon; a film that had potential to be outstanding, but fell short due to issues outside of people's control. Even Horizon still delivered and offered us a decent sci-fi/horror flick. This just takes from that and makes things a mess and ridiculous. I have NO idea why this film is rated as high as it is. I can only assume it has something to do with the fact that it's a Boyle film. Don't be fooled, however, this movie is terrible. TERRIBLE. In fact, it was so terrible, it convinced me to never watch another Boyle film again.</fullReview>

Not enough that the basic premises of the story don't make that much sense, or that many of the things that happen are not only scientifically absurd, but also inconsistent with themselves. As a plus, the plot is driven by unintelligible decisions and sudden accidents, and finally the appearance of some kind of charred monster from hell, which only due to the heroic self-sacrifice of the last remaining characters can be stopped from sealing the fate of mankind. (Pathos!) The characters are shallow, not much more than a face, a name, and maybe a profession, which doesn't give the good actors involved much of a chance to perform well. All of this is decorated with some pseudo-philosophical allusions (the sun is dying = god is dead, is that supposed to be the point??) and plenty of pretty-but-pointless computer-generated images. And of course references to genre films (2001, Alien, Silent Running,...) which only remind the viewer of the fact that science fiction movies can be intelligent, engaging, inspiring and entertaining -- but this one isn't.</fullReview>

That's the obvious plan, but unfortunately it does not quite work out.This isn't one of those "buddy films" with good soundtrack, or soundtrack at all. This is no Armageddon, except for the general theme (saving the mankind). No, this is more of an art film.The beginning is slightly promising, albeit boring. After about five minutes I was already thinking that this is probably not going to be a very good movie-experience for me... And I was right. I didn't like the script at all, and it got more and more stupid towards the end. I don't even know where to begin, so I don't.Maybe if this was made more like a "buddy film" this could've been more interesting to watch, and also some kind of a prologue explaining the background of the story would've been nice. We DID have an epilogue, so there really is no excuse not to have a prologue. Well, money maybe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ignoring the fact that the premise is ridiculous in scientific terms (almost as ridiculous as the premise for The Core), the plot of the movie borrows from previous movies in the genre to the extent that I might almost call it plagiarism. I won't mention any specifics, as I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone who really wants to see it, but the entire movie seems like it is nothing more than a remix of other films in the genre. The big production companies put out movies just like this ever couple of years, and they continue to get more and more tired and unimaginative, yet I always watch them. Sunshine, however, was so strikingly similar to the movies it copies that I almost didn't finish watching it. I could go on and on about the stereotypical plot devices and cliché dialogue, but I'll spare you the boredom. The point is, I understand why the big film companies make films like these. They can use tried-and-true ideas, put a subtle twist on them, and add cool special effects to create a money-making film. But, for all it's faults, I thought Sunshine was at least entertaining. Not gripping, or moving, or anything of that nature, of course. But entertaining enough that I finished it and felt I didn't completely waste my time on it. This was due, of course, the the aforementioned proved techniques for a movie that will make a quick buck with little effort. All that said, I would recommend that anyone thinking of seeing this movie spend their time and money on Event Horizon instead. But that's just my opinion.</fullReview>

Often I had no idea what was going on because I'd have to listen to a crew of numb, mumbling characters failing to get excited or get into anything, and parse ten or twelve monotone lines to find one plotpoint. For some reason no one over 26 goes into space. Because, like no one over 26 is cool enough in the future. Even the computer voice is some 26 year old. Even the previous crew is all 26. What a self-absorbed generation. Boyle must have watched Kubrick's 2001 and thought "This would be so much better if, instead of people over 30, the crew was all my photogenic, hipster friends." And if they were all aboard some sort of IKEA spaceship, with interiors right out of Dwell magazine. 'Sunshine' makes going into space look like some kind of upscale lifestyle choice for the creative class.The ending shifts the movie from 'metaphyscial' to 'stupid' as it rips off, errr, sorry "pays tribute," to half a dozen sci-fi movies from 'Alien' to 'Hellraiser in Space.' i.e. Ripley, errr, I mean Cillian, flees a space-baddie by fleeing into an airlock and changing into a spacesuit.In space, no one can hear you snore either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PLOT SUMMARY: An emo band and its fashionably Asian road crew go on a fabulously expensive trip to the Sun to re-ignite(!) it, presumably because we use the Sun too much. (Somehow, it's always our fault.)I have to say at the outset that I simply could not get through the entirety of this film. I copped out when the really bad "problem" filmed turned into a really bad "Alien" film. In short, there is basically nothing good you can say about this movie. It works as neither metaphor nor as science fiction. With respect to the latter, other comments on IMDb will suffice; the science has been more than adequately picked apart. The idea that the Sun will somehow burn out is bad to begin with; the simple equation of "Sun = bright THEREFORE hand mirrors will protect us" is just awful. Offensive, really.But maybe we can tolerate that, if the story is good, or if there is a point to it, or at least the characters are interesting (we all crave the day when all three of these come together). But come on -- Cillian Murphy as a physicist embarrasses two professions, physics and acting. Michelle Yeoh is wasted, as is Hiroyuki Sanada. The rest do what they can with an insultingly bad script. Here's a safety tip: if you're going to send a ship to the Sun, calling it "Icarus" is probably not a great idea, if you're betting on success. Calling it "Icarus" twice is even worse.In short, this film is so dreadful it stands as a very strong argument for file piracy. Such tripe should not be rewarded with a paying audience.</fullReview>

With a little more thought they could have made a good movie based on sound science. Instead, they insult the intelligence of anyone who's had fifth grade science.The premise for the movie is the sun is dying. A small crew is piloting a huge ship carrying a "stellar bomb" to restart the sun. As the movie starts, they enter a communications blackout zone, too close to the sun to communicate with earth.The crew shows no signs of military discipline, and it's impossible to believe they would have been entrusted with a bomb the size of Manhattan, and earth's last hope. I wouldn't trust them to cooperate enough to run a car wash.The crew doesn't seem to have a believable level of skill redundancy. Each member has a single focus, with no other member backing them up, or checking their work.The mission was apparently not equipped with a policy manual, or any contingency plans.The ship shows no design redundancy. Our space shuttles have more backup systems. I can't believe a ship carrying the last hope of mankind would be so poorly engineered.There's no discussion of safer techniques to compensate for a cold sun, ie orbital mirrors or fusion satellites.The communications blackout is absurd. It happens far to early, outside the orbit of mercury. We had a probe communicating back from mercury in 1975. With current laser technology, we could easily punch messages well into the sun's corona, and back out.The sun is dying at least a billion years ahead of schedule, and at a ridiculously fast rate.Fission reactions are the normal way of creating fusion chain reactions, in hydrogen bombs. However, trying to augment an existing fusion reaction with a fission explosion at least one trillion times smaller is absurd. The most probably outcome would be a small solar flare at the explosion site.The movie does contain some nice dramatic moments, but they're spoiled by being so artificially contrived.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But the lows win out thus I rated the movie a five.The first hour or so was a fairly well written and well crafted film. With the decision to go on a rescue mission to the first Icarus the movie begins a rapid decline in believability and continuity. So grading the movie again reveals the first hour was a 10 and the remainder of the movie earned a whopping goose egg. 5.For all the fans of the director I ask this: Why? It is a simple question. 28 Days was a decent zombie flick. That is all, no more no less. 28 Weeks, however, is a friggin train wreck. Trainspotting proved the director has talent. 28 days Later showed he still had talent but was opting for box office numbers instead of fine film making. 28 Weeks showed that he has become a numbers pandering movie maker. Sunshine cements that notion. It is one thing to fail with original thinking but to take so much from previous genre staples and fail is unforgivable. You could play a drinking game just picking out the ideas taken from 2001: A Space Odyssey. But that is the way of today. Steal what you can't come up with and then in all of your interviews claim it was done as an homage, thus freeing them from that cumbersome word--PLAGIARISM. Come on Danny come up with something new and original or go the hell away.28 Days is lauded for changing the nature of the zombie flick. The zombies move faster. That is all. Other than that it is a fairly straightforward rip-off of (insert your favorite zombie flick here).Back to the movie. The character development was good. The acting was good. The f/x were good. The direction for everything save the action scenes was good.The bad. The introduction of the solar powered psychopath was bad. Living on a dead ship for seven years while orbiting the sun closer than Mercury? Dumb, real dumb. Having a whining sniveling little biyotch like Harvey being a part of the crew? Dumb. The writer, Alex Garland, did fine for the first hour then he got stuck, "how to make it to feature length? Oh I know, I'll have a guy survive Icarus 1 who has been blinded by religious fervor. He will have murdered his own crew. Will have sabotaged his own ship. And now he'll do it to Icarus 2. Cool." No Alex it isn't cool. Why? Because you don't explain WHY! For a mission such as the one Sunshine is based on, saving earth, only the best and toughest people would be chosen. You wouldn't have a Harvey who is paranoid that he is the odd man out in all situations. You wouldn't have a Trey "fukking up". You would have a crew filled with Mace's who are tough, practical, and committed. But would you have Mace sending Capa out to repair the ship when later Mace acknowledges the fact that Capa is the only one of them who isn't expendable? I think not.But the solar god creature is the crap de la crap. Dumb idea. Then made worse by the stupid use of effects to show the character as something possibly more than human. From the intro in the solar viewing chamber to the final scene where he gets his skin ripped off we never get a good look at the character. You know you have an idea that can't be fleshed out in print or on story boards when the best you can come up with is to bathe the character in light, then hide him in darkness. Dumb, dull, threadbare.If Danny Boyle's next film is akin to this then I will cease watching his movies and put him in the same class of director as everybody's favorite whipping boy, Uwe Boll.</fullReview>

I've rarely seen a more idiotic and illogical move in a film. I was sitting there for the entire last 30 minutes in stunned silence, the strong thought of "You've got to be kidding me." just racing through my head. But, no that's not where the unrealism ends. So we are in the future, the sun is dying and we need to revive it. So, what do we do? We send a shuttle of eight people who are absolute geniuses at one particular element that is vital to the mission. It doesn't matter if they can work as a team, and it certainly doesn't matter if these people are complete morons outside of their one particular job, which they are. Seriously, the entire mission is based on dropping the payload and only one person on the entire shuttle has the ability to do it? What a joke. The characters had no depth at all, in my opinion, except for maybe Capa and Cassie though they ignore the small chance of development for Cassie pretty early on. They were all just flat, generic characters that I've seen in 99% of all "epic crisis" films. The cinematography was very poor. All of the snappy cuts and blurs and tilts made me a thousand times more nauseas than impressed. Don't get me wrong though, it wasn't all bad. The visuals were absolutely breathtaking. Mainly through them, the film created an entrancing experience that completely drew me out of the real world. The acting from the entire cast was pretty great, though they didn't have much room to create depth with the shallow characters they were given. Cillian Murphy and Rose Byrne were definitely the highlights, as I expected since they were by far my favorites of the cast in general. So, while entertaining and superbly acted the film was a huge disappointment for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie opens up with enough potential, and with a pretty interesting idea: the sun is dying, and the crew essentially need to restart it. The initial crew that went out to attempt to do the same thing, Icarus I, mysteriously disappeared. Of course, the crew of Icarus II hear the distress call that was masked by the gravity of Venus, and decide to alter their course to use the payload to double their chances of recharging the sun.So far so good. At this point, the movie is moving at a brisk pace. with a surprisingly good performance by Chris Evans who places the mission above all things. Also, the movie portrays what life on a ship must be like, especially for one of this length: the ship has an on board psychologist, an 'Earth Room" to de-stress oneself, a replenishing oxygen/fauna room, etc etc. The point where the Icuras II comes into contact with Icuras I is where the movie falls apart.Of course, following the conventions of the thriller, something goes wrong. And the tension is HIGH, Danny Boyle does a fantastic job of conveying the urgency of getting back to the Icurus II. After a miraculous jump through space, the crew comes back, but unknowingly, with an extra passenger. Who do you think sabotaged the linking of the ships in the first place? After this, rather than go on a philosophical angle like "Solaris", it takes notes from "Event Horizon", the movie reduces itself to a slasher/horror movie. Thats right, the single living crew member of the Icurus I is still alive, still able to speak, still able to run around not only normally, but superhumanly, and is pretty damn strong, goes around the Icurus II, because he's had conversations with God. An interesting idea that is ultimately executed terribly. The script could have used another revision or two or three to rework this entire act and the motivation of the stowaway.Over all, the movie is in a pretty wrapper, but nothing much else. It is beautifully filmed, great acting, Boyle's directing is up to par, as per usual, but over all, a major disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sun is dying, Earth slowly freezing, and a team of astronauts aboard a spaceship called "Icarus 2" attached to an extra-huge bomb sets out to correct this by throwing the bomb into the sun, thus reigniting it. As far as I remember, there is no explanation whatsoever in the film itself for the sun dying that early (instead of in five billion years); all the stuff about theoretical particles etc. may be mentioned by the filmmakers in commentaries or the like, but not in the film. Well, it doesn't matter. The dying sun is presented as a fact and the viewer, stunned by brilliant imagery and a well-paced succession of events, can accept this.Many beautifully made "sun effects" get us drawn into the majestic Sun's sheer greatness like the character at the movie's beginning who orders the spaceship's computer to let him see the sun as bright and as long as possible without getting blinded. Sadly, apart from the great idea to make the sun itself a film's main character, "Sunshine" has not a lot to offer. It's trying to present its obvious lack of ideas by over-obvious references to SF movie classics (calling the captain of the predecessor vessel "Pinbacker" and so on), but this doesn't help a lot. "Sunshine" is watchable, it doesn't exactly get boring, but without the aforementioned sun imagery it would be a bland, generic example of space SF.It seems the filmmakers were desperately seeking for surprising things to happen on the way to the sun, but couldn't come up with something better than the abstruse "Icarus 1" story. You see, our ship is called the "Icarus 2", the "Icarus 1" being a lost ship, the failed first attempt to bomb the sun. We meet the Icarus 1, everyone there is dead although the ship is in good working order: they killed themselves by exposing to the sun, and from old records it seems that the captain suffered from some religious insanity, saying that if God wants to destroy Sun and Earth, they shouldn't try to interfere. After the astronauts are back on board of the Icarus 2, it turns out that Captain Pinbacker of the Icarus 1 isn't dead after all, has somehow managed to get to the Icarus 2, and wants to destroy everything. That's lame, that's meagre in my opinion.It is also not a big surprise that the mission ultimately gets accomplished, though everyone on board dies. People watching the brightening sun from Earth, relatives viewing our hero's last message... a very expectable ending. It's all done well enough, however, to say that it is a movie you certainly can watch if you like space SF; I have bought it on DVD and don't think I wasted my money. It will not be one of your favorite movies, I presume, especially if compared to the great classics of the genres, but it will be a movie of which you will remember something - the enthralling Sun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to think back to a time when there was a good sci-fi horror/thriller. Perhaps we need to go back to Ridley Scott's "Alien" for a genuine look at how such a film should be made. Sunshine comes nowhere near the levels of Alien, and that film was made back in the late 70's.A miss matched, bumbling and very young group of people(seemingly way to young for the importance of their mission) set out to save Humanity from our sun that had decided to burn its-self out several billion years before it's supposed to. They manage to make almost every mistake in the book ranging from going wildly off their mission parameters to not realizing there was an intruder running around on their ship.I failed to connect with any of the crew in any meaningfully way and as such failed to feel anything for them as they all passes away in a variety of colorful ways. It was worth a try but Sunshine ultimately fails the test of being a true sci-fi horror or thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool effects but dumb yucky editing / directing choices. "The Core" in space.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected so much more with this one. I suppose I could say it was "The Core," but dealing with the sun and be close to the truth of it. Or another summery would be "a bunch of people go crazy for the second time trying to save mankind from the impossible...?" But as to why I really got disgusted was the abundance of plot holes and the poor choice in filming methods. Honestly, when ever they showed the crazed burnt captain of the first ship, I thought the film was breaking in the projector. I actually looked back towards the projection booth twice!! Talk about a poor way to hide the monster! Don't they fire cinematographers for that? I mean even in Alien and Jaws you see the monster un bleared and un stuttered at some point! Plot holes: How does a by deff smart Physicist who has just worn a space suit in the previous scene not remember that there is a radio in the suit? How does the super smart computer that runs the ship not double check the flight engineers math? (Heck Excel does that!) How does the super smart computer that runs the ship not think the sudden addition of a person on board not warrant mentioning until the end? Why would there not be space suits for everyone on board the ship? And I could go on for a while.Sorry, but the holes piled up so quickly for me that the bottom fell out of the movie before the third act. That coupled with a filming technique that I can only call, unique, build a foundation of mud that I slowly felt sucked under and drowned. Positively yucky. "The Core" in space.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like the Icarus II mission, Sunshine proves that with sufficient chutzpah, even the most outrageous plan can succeed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking a premise based on scientific fact, filmmaker Danny Boyle has created a wonderfully visual sci-fi thriller... In the year 2057, the Sun is dying and mankind faces extinction. The last hope of Earth lies with the Icarus II, a spacecraft with a crew of eight men and women led by Captain Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada). Their mission, put simply, is to deliver a nuclear device designed to re-ignite our fading sun.Deep into their voyage, out of radio contact with Earth, the crew hears a distress beacon from the Icarus I, the spacecraft that had disappeared on the same mission seven years earlier. A terrible accident throws the new mission into jeopardy. Soon, the crew members find themselves fighting not only for their lives and their sanity, but also for the future of all mankind.Sure, you can complain about the science. Both Boyle(director) and Garland(writer) acknowledge that some of the practical issues may not stand up to scrutiny, but did we need to see circuit diagrams of 2001's HAL, or understand the breeding cycles of Ridley Scott's Alien? Sunshine asks for a leap of faith, but it remains true to its own internal logic, which is essentially that of a class-A B-movie that nods respectfully towards Tarkovsky's Solyaris.In the trade off between science and fiction, it's the latter that takes precedence here, but if you're prepared to get with the programme, this is a brilliantly designed thriller by a writer and director re-introducing awe to the genre. Like the Icarus II mission, Sunshine proves that with sufficient chutzpah, even the most outrageous plan can succeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no doubt that Sunshine has serious pretensions to be a 2001 for the 21st Century - but is probably closer to Event Horizon in most respects - and that is definitely NOT a good thing.In parts, admittedly, this is visually very impressive and on the whole the characters are pretty engaging and not badly acted - although one has to doubt how some of them (most?) got through astronaut training school! Unfortunately the thing I can't get away from is the script, and some of the glaring holes in the plot which just made the film increasingly frustrating to watch as it went on. For example, they have a bomb a mile across which has required most of the Earth's remaining fissile material to produce - yet they can't find room to store enough oxygen for the crew to survive a 2-3 year mission! What? An attempt is made early on in the film to justify the crew's decision to rendezvous with the ill-fated craft from the first mission - and for a moment they nearly have you discarding all your logic and believing it. Nearly. That's when you realise that you're well and truly in Event Horizon territory.Don't get me wrong - it's an enjoyable sci-fi romp. But 2001 it ain't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lucky enough to see a preview Danny Boyle's new film is brilliant. The visuals and an amazing sound design work wonders on what could have been a simple story.The film is also full of interesting questions and raises questions about society, religion and space. Boyle proves himself the master of suspense and tension and I had fun spotting his film references that are littered thought out the film.Helping Boyle is a fantastic cast with everyone delivering and adding depth to what could be simple stereotypes in other hands. You may have seen their characters before: the cowardly second in command, the gun ho American, the quiet scientist who could be up to something etc. But they are all played with brilliantly with control and depth. Chris Evans in particular comes of age in a star making performance. If Cillian Murphy anchors the film, Evans drives it.The last act does trip Boyle up as he struggles with an ending to a great set up also the film is short. I wanted to spend more time with the crew but it is always better to walk out a cinema wanting more rather than less.</fullReview>

Because of that I went into it thinking I was about to experience a "thinking" movie. In that regard the script failed me or I caused it to fail with improper expectations. Being close but ultimately failing is worse than failing outright in my opinion. This movie is a good thriller. There are philosophical elements here although the delivery feels juvenile in the way that some anime does the same. I would rather have been bored by a slower pace with smarter writing as in Solaris than a poor attempt at depth.If you are annoyed by films that try hard to be smart and fail miserably, consider yourself forewarned.

Basically, one good thing would happen, and then several bad things would happen. They found the original Icarus' distress signal, But Trey screwed up, the captain died, the garden was destroyed and all hope for them getting home was lost. Every time, you thought it couldn't get bleaker, it gets a little bleaker just so the movie can string you along for another 15 minutes until their situation gets Even worse. It just gets really old after a while. Every time a character was personalized they died shortly afterward. The whole movie was incredibly predictable.

		<shortDescription>SUNSHINE (Danny Boyle, 2007) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third collaboration between director Boyle and novelist/screenwriter Alex Garland starts and ends confusingly but has a fairly gripping middle section in which, apparently, everything that can go wrong during a space mission does. One never really knows how the fate of the whole world comes to be left in the hands of these seven people (including three Asians!) all of him are barely over 30 years of age; at times, I was reminded of the anime stuff I used to watch as a kid in which teenagers control robots and spacecraft and battle every kind of horrid monster...but, I'm pretty sure this was not the film-makers' intention! What's worse is that only three of these characters ? played by Cillian Murphy (whom I caught ? at close range ? acting in a play in the West End with Neve Campbell last January!), Chris Evans and Rose Byrne ? are sympathetic at all, which rather makes this a relentlessly grim and dreary affair for most of its running time.The story deals with the sun starting to die out and a special mission subsequently launched into space to shoot a huge bomb into the sun which would create a newer sun (or so we are told). As it happens, a few years previously another vessel had been sent out but that mission was unsuccessful; even so, the new crew come across that spaceship and decide to take their explosive device (called payload) because "two payloads are better than one". What they find on the seemingly abandoned spaceship will alter the course of their mission forever...What this film has going for it, apart from an obviously cerebral take and a couple of good performances, is the fact that one really gets the feeling, via some awesome visual sequences, of the extreme heat of the sun (which literally burns their captain to a crisp) and cold in space (their second-in-command smashes against the side of the spaceship when attempting re-entry through a defective airlock). On the debit side, then, are a fairly useless percussion-heavy electronic score and the unnecessary addition of a marauding decomposing maniac in the figure of the captain of the previous mission which, being no ALIEN replacement and the fact that ? through some silly camera jerkiness ? we are deprived of ever getting a really good look at him (although, this is remedied in the deleted scenes section of the DVD), seems like just one too many trips to the well...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good special effects, some good acting, but looks like a bad remake of Event Horizon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard that this movie contains some similar themes with Event Horizon, which is one of my favorite sci-fi/horror movies. Also,considering the director Danny Boyle, I went to see it. However it seemed like I had to be turned down by it.The movie itself strives to deliver a deep message concerning humanity. The tag line "our sun is dying" is really somehow very impressive. And the way the lines came out is quite religious. God, Faith, Hope, Purpose are referred time to time as the story goes on. The makers really attempted to capture the feeling of death and the humanity dwelling inside death itself. It is a good try, but too often left the audiences unaware of the REAL MATERIAL by emphasizing on the special effects. Yes, the special effects are great. For several times I could already feel the red-hot of the environment, while actually sitting in the theater. Not to mention the very well made astronauts out-side walking scenes.Concerning actors, I should say thanks to the casting, one of the Asians' favorite faces Yeon is on the big screen, doing her part quite well. Cilian Murphy plays a good man this time, and honestly speaking he succeeded as he really looks honest, gentle and sometimes shy. Chris Evans character is very impressively, a hero/saint. His faith in completing the mission/ helping the crews moved me several times.Now let's get to the point. Sunshine has been categorized as Sci-fi/drama/thriller on IMDb. However I strongly recommend one more genre--horror. For only one reason, that it spoofed the whole plot and structure of Event Horizon. The ship approaches the first ship in the search of the survivors of the first crew. Does that sound a little familiar? What about the captain of the first ship went crazy and lead his crew to destruction? Not to mention the very famous "vacuum flying human scene" also come from Event Horizon. It seems that the director wanted to concentrate on its own theme of redemption, but inevitably fell into the horror movie's structure like Event Horizon. The first ship's captain was described as simply a crazed/pessimistic wretch whose mind is filled with religious pessimism. And the explanation of the suicide of the first crew is as simple as "infected and persuaded by their crazed boss". All this is far far behind Event Horizon's sense of mystery and suspicion. And there may be a plot hole that, how could the first captain, after so burned by the sun, have survived for seven years without proper medication? And since the A.I. of the ship is so advanced, how could it let the ugly villain enter the ship from beginning? I doubt the writer should recheck such details again.Even the final conclusion is quite similar as Event Horizon. Cillian Murphy's role decided to sacrifice himself in order to save the world, as well as to defeat the bad guy. Just it is so pushed forward without much of character development that, there's no way to be satisfied.Disappointing. 6/10 for cast and FX.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got no buzz on this movie through the normal channels, and the trailer didn't leave me with warm fuzzies either. But after reading the article in the current "American Cinematographer", I decided to give it a shot anyway.I am not generally drawn to sci-fi, but love a good story or character study. My problem with this film is that it tried to be both, but failed at both. Though I can live without the requisite fanfare that would have been necessary had the story started on earth with a launch, very little is done to help us connect with the characters. All of them seem distant, not only to the audience, but to each other. The most intimate relationships seem to come from men grappling with each other.The holes in science has been covered far better than I could by other reviewers. But even with that, the plot holes it leaves are nearly unbearable and grossly undermine the story. Dispensing with the captain early along in the film is a mistake. He and Mace (Chris Evans) are the only characters with enough screen presence here to carry the film.Michele Yeoh was a disappointment. She didn't get much of a shot to do anything, and I wonder why she signed on for this. The other characters were so poorly developed, I can't remember their screen names less than an hour after coming from the theater. A number of other reviews have praised the character development done in this film. Frankly, I am wondering if they saw the same film I did. Character development would have shed light on things like were any of them married. Did they have families back home. Was Capa talking to his mother, his sister, or his wife back home. Where were the crew from? Who did they work for? Who launched the Icarius 2, and for that matter the first one. How did they all know each other? Who were they supposed to talk to with the communication tower that was destroyed? I realize there may not have been budget to build sets for mission control, but give us SOME connection back to Earth.Another oddity hit me. Apparently, they've been in space for 16 months. And this movie plays out in apparently less than 1 full day. No one slept. We had a spacewalk, a wacky computer, a suicide, and the death of most of the crew occur within 1 day after 16 months of apparently nothing. Technically, the camera work at times was very good. Other times it was awkward at best. It wasn't dim enough to be dark, and it wasn't bright enough (save for the observation room scenes) to be grand. Frankly it just seemed boring. Even the computer was lackluster. Hal-9000 has personality.I realize I've come down pretty harshly on the film, and it's not all bad. I think the people on screen and behind the camera probably extracted all they could from what seems like a weak script.Danny Boyle's comment in American Cinematographer is, "If you're going to make a space movie, you've got to make something a bit different..." Perhaps something a lot closer to the classics would have yielded better results.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunshine - It's 50 years from now and, for whatever reason (50 is quite short of several million), the Sun is going out. Fortunetly, the characters of "Sunshine" saw the then 54 year old film "The Core" and thought a nuclear device would be an awesome way to jump start the sun.There are huge gaps in logic here that you must put aside for this film. In fact I'm not entirely sure which body part this film was made for. Clearly not the brain. But it wasn't made with the heart either because I felt strangely cold towards most of the characters save Cillian Murphy. They all put in time and effort into developing characters and clearly acted decently but the script didn't give anyone something intelligent or interesting to do. Mostly they all just looked at holographs of the sun. What, no one brought a Playstation or a Tivo? Or even a frisbee for that big warehouse room Cillian's character has? Are we to believe that the powers that be: the combined mights of...America and China it looks like....put the future of mankind into the hands of these wimpy dolts? Michelle Yeoh runs without thinking to an purely oxygen filled room engulfed in flame, because she's crushed that her plants are being killed. And why does a ship on a mission to the sun need a botanist anyway? It's like having an Empath on the Enterprise.Eventually they all get picked off one by one, because it's a sci-fi film on a clunky spaceship. And the rule for sci-fi is the clunkier and bigger the ship, the stupider the humans get. You know there are annoying panicky two-dimensional characters to kill off as they struggle to "Poseidon Adventure" their way through the film. Some of them DO die in pretty cool ways, so those of you that always wanted to see a man freeze and break into pieces in the cold vacumn of space, this movie has found your niche.Of course, I'm being picky. The acting by Cillian Murphy and his Ripley look-a-like girlfriend is top notch. Chris Evans keeps on picking fights with everyone (They didn't psych-profile him?), but he does get to display some acting chops. There are some genuinely frightening moments, but anyone hoping for "28 Days in Space" will be disappointed. The music is quite good. The effects for the sun and ship are good and believable, but lordy lordy why are the spacesuits so crappy looking? It's like they took Marvin the Paranoid Android and designed him in a disco ball pattern. All the suits need now is some sequins.I could've forgiven the movie some of it's faults but the ending is a mess. It's one of those scatterbrained mindbender endings like "The Fountain" that tries to ride on emotion rather than coherency. I'm sorry but "Donnie Darko" was the only movie that could get away with that. Sunshine was an okay but sometimes boring often predictable (the one guy out there who didn't see the ending coming was also probably the same technician that started the chain of idiotic mishaps in the movie) film. I still like Danny Boyle and love Cillian Murphy, but I hope Boyle has his sh!t together better next time. C.</fullReview>

Nothing is truly gained by making the film as bloody as it is and a lot is actually taken away.Also the movie doesn't get better as it goes along.

		<fullReview>SUNSHINE doesn't quite burn brightly. The production design is terrific, there are scenes of shock and awe, the acting is solid, it touches on important themes and yet, it ends up a misfire.The film basically remains within the ship for almost the entire length, and that's fine, but without a framing story, you really feel like you are entering a film missing a first reel. You do eventually get caught up in the drama of this mission to the Sun, but then, all kinds of dramatic contrivances (both interesting and confused) get tossed into the mix without adding to the central story. In fact, the last of them, totally torpedoes the last act.By Hollywood standards, a modestly budget film, SUNSHINE has some spectacular visuals. The details seem to be right (though the interiors of the craft are, as usual, too large to be practical). The EVA suits looked cool on one hand, but the Samurai Suit meets Deep Sea Diving look reads as more designed than realistic. One question which both SUNSHINE and the somewhat similar SOLAR CRISIS never really address is why the missions wouldn't be unmanned ones which would make far more scientific sense considering the complexity of habitation anywhere close to a Sun (Dramatic purposes, of course, but the films should have made more plausible cases for the manned aspect of the mission). Further, by the time the spaceships have to "turn back" they are still so far from the Sun that it doesn't seem all to critical to send men when machines can get so much further before becoming non-operational.2001 and the Russian SOLARIS remain the gold standard for the deep space mission pictures, with nods to the Czech VOYAGE TO THE END OF THE UNIVERSE (aka IKARIE XB-1 if you can find an uncut version) and the dark comedic version, DARK STAR (SUNSHINE has a character named "Pinbacker" which must be an homage to the latter film's "Pinback", no?).Why is it that in so many of these spaceflight films, the crew are always at each other's throats and getting unhinged? If the Russian and U.S. space histories are examined, you don't find any major incidents (Granted, the missions - so far - have been much briefer and less distant); Indeed, quite the opposite. Even during the critical days of Apollo 13, the crew banded together, not apart.On a tech note, I saw the movie at Mark Cuban's new Landmark complex in West Los Angeles utilizing their much publicized Sony 4K Digital Projection. To these eyes, digital projection has made great strides (particularly in regards to sharpness and bright objects), but still has quite noticeable problems with contrast and true blacks. The dark, blacks have an inky muddiness. Top notch 35MM projection is still the standard.</fullReview>

After big problems and 70% of the crew dies, something drastic changes...This was also the same type of movie. A lot of strange screens with the sun, then some man, again the sun.

Can you believe.Things that made me wanna see it : Cillian Murphy in a good guy role, Chris Evans (I love all his movies), Michele Yeoh (everybody told me about her, I didn't see any of her movies till now).For me, Murphy isn't bad guy anymore. He is fantastic actor, with unique face structure, rare blue eyes that create an impression of psycho-pate. Except for "28 days later", I have seen him in a bad guy roles. The best one was definitely in "Batman Begins". Dr. Johnatan Crane, a.k.a Scarcrowe, was the best bad guy in Batman franchise, after big Jack Nicholson. Maybe they could share the trophy. He was great also in "Red eye", where he disturbed Lisa Riser (Rachel McAdams) on a plane. I can't wait to see more of his films. Good or bad guy, whatever. He is great in both situations.Chris Evans is so young, but yet, very famous actor, even in Serbia. For a reason. The first time, I saw him in "Not another teen movie", where he shown his comic potential. Later I saw him in "Cellular", which is one of my favorite action films (also because of Jason Statham). "London" really blew me away whit great dialogs and again, Statham and Evans, but also Jessica Biel (oh God, I want to date her). But definitely, my favorite movie with Evans is "Fantastic four". Comment unnecessary. In "Sunshine", he is a little rude and senseless, but his character needed all that to be real. He is a man with mission, and he can't allow anything to stop it. But he will come as a hero, you'll see if you haven't so far.All in all, fantastic movie, fantastic cast, highly recommendable! Get up and run to the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't be burnt by this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of 28 days later and Trainspotting, so I had high hopes for this film when I discovered it was directed by Danny Boyle. What I eventually saw however was something far from what I would have imagined. I'm still not entirely sure what they were trying to achieve by this film, but whichever decision you finally make I can safely say they didn't achieve it.The acting was pretty poor with the exception of Chris Evans, who in my opinion stole the film. Even Cillian Murphy produced the weakest performance I've seen. In contrast, the CGI was spectacular but after I had seen several dozen shots of the ship/sun, I was over it already.I'm not overly fussy about things being 100% accurate when it comes to films, but this film even stretched my patience. There were just too many things that were implausible and quite frankly ridiculous. My major complaint being: How can a man survive with burns that extensive, and if he did, how could he do it for 7 years?! There were also far to many "why would you do that?"s For example, why would you forget to adjust the sun shield? Why would you investigate the '5th person' without notifying your colleagues? Why would you only show one person how to detonate the bomb? The final problem I had with this film was that it was soooooo boring! It took what seemed like forever to get to it's conclusion. And finally the film was over - just like that! In summery this film was RUBBISH!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did i see the same movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess the saying, everyone is different really is true. Whilst i thought that there were certainly some really good elements to this film, for the most part i thought it was actually quite boring.In my mind it didn't seem to know quite where it wanted to take the story - there was the lead up to the other ship - then they found it - then they left. It was a real anticlimax to be honest.People ask me - is it like Deep Impact? Definitely not, in fact i'd say it is more like - and this is going to see really odd i know, a thinking mans Jason X, rolled in with Event Horizon &amp; The Black Hole (yes the Disney sci-fi movie!).I noticed someone said it was as suspenseful as Alien!? - I'd like to know which part they thought wasn't obvious! - for example; how many times are we going to see the old, find the spooky garbled ships log?? To me suspense only works if it actually leads up to something big &amp; a little unexpected - a major climax, whether it be a battle or a plot twist. In my mind this had nothing.This said i didn't like Event Horizon either (also found that laboured and dull) - i much preferred the Alien movies (except 3).I must also add that some of the film to me just didn't seem to make much sense - too many "why wouldn't you just..." or "why would you do that" moments for me.Unfortuantley it is difficult to make sci-fi movies like this that don't contain elements of existing ones, but i would have gone down the route of; Ship fatally damaged resulting in having to dock with the I1 - theirs explodes leaving them on the original, trying to get it back up and running. One by one things start to go wrong and they being to suspect each other - but it turns out that the whole crew is still alive, and not happy about them being there. One however is on their side and tries to help them seal them off from the murderous I1 crew. They do this, but in the end he is killed by the captain of I2, who in fact is in with the I1 crew. All this is done because they decide they want to create a new utopia &amp; discover that if they let the sun die to a certain level &amp; then restart it, this will kill off humanity but not destroy the earth itself.OK I'm not a writer, but i think this would have been a lot less expected than what i saw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried, I really tried, to like this film.I wasn't optimistic when I first heard of it: the thing appeared to be yet another example of the 'Earth is doomed because X, unless brave scientists/oilmen/Bruce Willis can fix it by delivering a bloody great Nukyoolar Bahm' - where in this case, X='the sun is dying'. And Dawkins knows we've had enough of those.This particular X snagged me, too: No, it isn't! Notwithstanding the musings of philosophers of the calibre of Alvin Lee et al, our star will keep trundling along happily for billions of year after we've all been crushed by discarded AAA batteries. You may bank on it. It's too fundamental to do a 'what if' on: the moon isn't made of cheese, either. We've moved on.But there's no denying that the movie is very pretty. I decided on a 'watch once, then ignore' approach, until I heard about Dr. Cox's involvement, and the QBall theory. I bought the DVD on the basis that there might be a better cut that brought these more plausible mechanisms into the plot.Alas, they only get a commentary track, presumably for us poor saps who like a little science with our fiction. All the good, if slightly star-struck, doctor really provides is a post-hoc rationalisation - one that he clearly has only grudging affection for. The film has no mention of exotic star-eating particles or the likelihood of blowing them out of the core of a giant fusion bomb using a comparatively minuscule fission bomb. The scientific basis for Capa getting to 'touch the sun', though it is actually discussed in the film, is just plain silly. After a while, the rest of this technological mess - artificial gravity that works on air**; a bomb big enough to have gravity; using a teeny garden for oxygen when there's all that solar electricity around, et bleedin' cetera - ceases to be artistic license and becomes an artistic crime-wave.Even the religious nutter - which ordinarily I would approve of on principle - begins to look like a cheap shot: machina ex deus.Please, Danny. Stop doing this. If you must try to do SF, and have the power to summon CERN physicists, why not do it *before* you write the screenplay, and let them advise you how reality works then - rather than using them as your defence attorney *after* you discover that your science leaks like a bogroll balloon. And read some real SF - something that Spielberg wouldn't touch.Or recognise that fantasy's really all you can hack.CD **Yes I saw that. Don't try to wheedle out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I happened to catch Sunshine last night on Sky Movies, almost by accident. The TV guide review gave it 4 stars, and it's a SciFi, so TV dinner in hand, I settled down to be enlightened.Sadly, it was not to be. The first shadow of doubt occurs very early on, after the voice-over, and after we see Earth looking pretty fine thank you, despite the allegedly serious lack of sun (hint: an ice age would start very, very quickly following any serious perturbation in the Sun's output).From here, the darkness spreads. We are treated to a pointless and overly-dramatised shot of a chap sunning himself in the observatory. Quite where the sunlight comes from, given the Icarus is lurking behind a massive shield, is not made clear. But I'll let that one go (maybe there's a window in the shield), because of the plot problems, it's by far the smallest.The crew, as we are introduced to them, actually seem to be relatively stable, sane, and - surely not - trained? Not that that lasts, of course, and pretty soon stupid decisions and petty fighting come to rule the roost. In fact, I got the impression I was watching Eastenders in Space; lots of shouting and hollering, and not a lot of brainpower being engaged.The shouting match following the course change/sun shield incident was the final straw for me - and I switched it off. Ah, blessed darkness.What should have been a great film - with a good plot (fixing the sun), descends into formulaic mediocrity (that's before the plot twist I've since read about - I turned off before that bit happened). As a Brit, it does seem to me that a large number of more recent American films (particularly scifi, but not exclusively) revolve around a small number of people who simply abandon their "training" and start arguing with and shouting at each other. Not my idea of entertainment. Of course, again as a Brit, we're not exactly immune from that sort of screenplay ourselves.However, compare/contrast the tight storyline of, say, the Bourne films; verses the argumentative, divisive and swiss-cheese-holey storyline of Sunshine (the first half, at least). Bourne manages to keep you engaged right to the end of the film and beyond (you WANT TO KNOW what happens to Bourne afterwards); whereas by 45 minutes into Sunshine I couldn't have cared less if they burned.My final verdict on Sunshine, in case you hadn't already guessed (and assuming you're even reading this right now) is: Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was okay with all the plot and character and scientific weaknesses in this movie. It has stunning visuals and I liked the music and maybe I was distracted with thinking "hey, maybe it'd be cool to live on a spaceship with plants and stuff." What ruined it for me was the crazy guy introduced in the second half. WTF?!?! Okay, so the old captain turned into a religious whacko and sabotaged the mission, fine. But how did he also turn into a majorly sunburnt, super-strong psychopathic serial killing monster with tear-off arms? It's nonsense. And what's also nonsense are the visual effects whenever he's on-screen. I think I saw something similar done with a serial killer in a particularly bad episode of Walker, Texas Ranger. I guess the director wasn't aiming very high.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of potential, but wasted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To make a good movie in the sci-fi genre, you have to convince the audience that the events that unfold on screen are plausible to a certain degree. 'Sunshine' fails to do this in every aspect. If you have seen 'The Core' you probably know what I mean: "WE'VE GOT FULL ROTATION!" :) The first 30 minutes or so are fairly good - the ambiance on board the space ship reminds me of much better productions such as 'Solaris'.But what follows is laughable. The crew runs into problems caused by human error that simply could not happen in reality because of the sophistication of the AI computer systems on board.This problem triggers even more problems, the spacecraft is nearly destroyed and the crew cannot handle the situation very well. The crew obviously does not have the qualities needed for such a long journey. It is very unlikely that a crew that behaves like this would be selected for the mission - to save mankind.The crew decides to deviate from the intended route - another terrible mistake leading to even more problems and waste of human life. They eventually encounter some form of horror that totally lacks credibility.The action/violence scenes particularly bad. Irritatingly noisy, flashing and filmed from strange angles.It is sad that so much potential is wasted: a fairly high budget, good acting, nice looking computer effects...With some rewriting of the story and a more sensible set-up, this movie could have been a real hit. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No surprises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must first of all say that the visuals of this movie is good so no need to put down people who have made a good job. I think that everything in this movies storyline is BS. Nothing new under the sun. I've seen it before and by god I've seen it before. Crew dances into space to rescue someone or something and suddenly problems begin to arise. Well haven't we all seen this before? I must say im so utterly disappointed with this movie because it brings nothing to surprise onto the table. Its like Western movies - if you ain't got a masterpiece of a storyline you'll end up with a lot of bullets a lot of horse riding, some bad guys and some good guys...big surprice. Its the same with this kind of space genre. If you ain't got story enough to fill the space inside the spaceship, you sure as hell gonna end up with a lot of visuals of the ship, the sun, the moon, and maybee some daring spacesuit-walks to make us feel like they are screwed --BUT WE HAVE SEEN IT ALL BEFORE!!! Get it now. Its a large budget movie with OK actors (apart from the whining of the girls onboard the ship all the time). The logic simply doesn't fit... Here you have members of a crew...they are destined to freight a supermega bomb to the sun and plausible die in the attempt. These humans on this very important ship would in my logic people who would possess extreme measures of nerves of steel and a logic nature above whimpering noises every time they have to open their mouth in the movie. Its an irrational character build - and it makes the movie even more stupid to watch. I simply cant comprehend how you can mess up such a nice scenery with such a lack of confidence in the characterbuild - I feel sorry for the actors - because they have been put in a movie whos only agenda obvious is to sell their movie to a generation of folks who either forgot the Stanley Kubrick movies or don't know them.And once again we had to se a person die in space. It would mean something to me if I felt anything for him, or I would feel sorry for his commerades because i felt i knew him through them - but no. The character build is so weak that i wouldn't care if he burned up in the sun. By the way!! If you are that close to the sun as they were, is it then still possible to freeze up when you are that close to the sun? Just a question i wouldn't know how to figure out i realtime. In my mind it seems irrational. 2 stars for keeping the B movie genre alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mankind should be saved from movies like this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film would have been virtually unintelligible to me if it weren't so derivative. If there had been any real imagination involved, I probably would have been lost; fortunately, it was all put together with typical formulas from the sci-fi genre so I as able to figure out what was happening pretty easily. Everything about "Sunshine" is a mess. The choppy and confusing editing, the cliché-ridden and often laughable screenplay, the robotic and wooden acting- all these things and a hundred others join forces to make this one of the biggest time-wasters I have experienced in awhile. The premise is shaky, the characters are one-dimensional ciphers who are imperiled before the audience even has a chance to know who they are (so why should we care?), the plot meanders aimlessly to a foregone conclusion and muddies it up along the way with twists and turns that would make even Agatha Christie ashamed of herself- it even changes in the third act from a pseudo-thoughtful sci-fi drama to a monster movie. Why? And from beginning to end the script, the design, the cinematography- everything- are riddled with nods and references to truly great, iconic sci-fi movies like "2001: A Space Oddysey," "Silent Running," "Outland," and- especially- "Alien," which in a better movie might seem like reverential tributes but in this dreck are worse than rip-offs. It's like Mr. Boyle and his collaborators tried to build a whole movie out of bits and pieces of better ones from the past. They failed. Don't get me wrong: there are a lot of talented and intelligent people involved here who have done fine work on other films. It's just that this time, they got themselves involved in a turkey that should have been roasted before it ever got the chance to strut around the barnyard. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Follows same tiring formula as other "Saving the Earth" movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've seen "Saving the Earth" movies like The Core and Armageddon or even movies about space missions gone wrong like Red Planet or Mission to Mars then there is no need to see this film. It follows the same basic formula these other movies do. That formula is this. A crew goes on a mission in some type of ship, a unforeseen problem arises and the only way to prevent the ship from being destroyed is if a crew member does something that puts his own life at risk. The ship is saved but we lose one of the crew. A new problem arises and we lose yet another member. The ship begins to loose life support. The crew become aware of the fact that they only have enough oxygen, or food, or fuel to complete the mission but not enough to return, but continue on the mission anyway. One by one crew members die, and in the end one person sacrifices himself to save the world. The End.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They should have sent monkeys in to Space instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually love Danny Boyle films but I had a few issues with this one. It's not a touch on Event Horizon or Space Odyssey and is mediocre at best. I liked the idea and found the story appealing &amp; interesting. I would have appreciated a bit more science about how the Sun could potentially leave the Earth in a solar winter, and why a nuclear bomb would save the Earth.For starters... Why call a (space)ship destined to fly to the Sun, Icarus? Surely that must be tempting fate? And worse still... when that ship disappears, why call the next one Icarus 2!!! Jeez, that's like eating a shotgun sandwich!! The crew of the ship are a bit stupid as well. Surely trained astronauts on this mission would know that looking directly at the Sun is a no,no (Dr Searle); and why does Capa make such an obvious reference that it takes 8 minutes for the light from the sun to reach Earth - everyone knows that old chestnut. And besides, why was it even necessary to send a last minute message home and get all angry about it(Mace), especially when they all knew communications were due to stop working! talk about being disorganised - they had 16 months to say their farewells! And all of the above just relates to the first 10 minutes of the film. I could go on and write a couple of sides of A4 about all the dumb character actions, but the worst thing about this film had to be the shaky-cam. It wasn't so much a shaky-cam, rather an epileptic-seizure-cam - it gave me a headache anyway and put the last nail in the coffin.They should have just sent a bunch of monkeys in to Space instead. Oh wait, they did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts off OK but soon slips into horror/gore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could have been a decent movie. It was a bit of a stretch to buy the premise of the sun dying but not anymore than some other movies. If they had stayed with the theme it could have been good. They could have went with the psychological theme of a crew member screwing up and feeling guilty. Or they could have worked with the theme of how hard it was to deliver the payload. But, instead, they went with the creature/gore theme and not very well. I still don't know what powers the person had that made him able to blur film. That part made no sense at all.There was no back story on any of the characters so we did not get to know them or care about them at all. There was even less about the crewman who went mad. Why did he go mad, what was his reasoning for killing everyone, other than he had a God complex.Tell me if I am wrong but I had a real problem with the oxygen troubles. They had a ship that huge, with a "cargo bay" bigger than a hanger and yet there was not enough oxygen for a few days or weeks for all the crew. Don't you think there could have been a way to shut off some of those sections and use confine themselves to one room and save oxygen. I know that is is the same amount whether it is free in or tanks but in areas that big there is bound to be slow leaks, chemical reactions, i.e. rust, or other consumers of oxygen, and isolating the air to a few rooms seems to me to be a wiser choice. And WHERE was the GRAVITY coming from?Toward the end so much of the story was obstructed with overexposed sections that were to represent the brightness of the sun that it was impossible to follow what was going on.I watched this movie because I heard that it was supposed to be great. I don't know who would think this is great. It is standard creature/horror and not well done creature/horror at that. I give it two stars because some of the visuals are good but that is about all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where has all the logic gone...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went to see Sunshine I really did not know what to expect. From what I had heard of this film in advance, the overall theme was not (as one might otherwise have expected) the general "We have to save Earth from a human-made or natural catastrophe. But how the hell are we going to pull that of". No No No, the focus of this film was of a psychological kind. The human behavior.So as I began to watch "Sunshine", I was not at all concerned with the fact, that there was very little prehistoric information to what might have led to the point in time, where humanity, in order to save themselves, needed to nuclear jump-start the Sun. Surely, this was not important knowledge since the mission to the Sun only functioned as the context in witch the human behavior was to unfold.But during the film I was getting this increasingly feeling that I had been greatly misinformed regarding the plot. The human behavior in display in this context (and any other for that matter) was so utterly misplaced, improbable and cliché that I found it impossible to believe in - even though I tried to imagine the crew in the film, being a bunch of nut-cases, previous to the "jumpstart the Sun"-mission.Somewhere in the middle of the film it undergoes a dramatic shift from the sci.fi.-psychological theme to a mere horror-theme (very much like "Event Horizon"). From this moment on, "Sunshine" turns into your basic "Save the world in a nick of time, before the crazed, supernatural guy kills all of the crew-members".I must say that I was not impressed with this movie. At all. In the attempt of portraying the psychology of human behavior this movie fails. In the attempt of creating a trustworthy science fiction story, again "Sunshine" fails. As a horror-movie "sunshine" fails big time.In fact. Should humanity ever come in the situation where a "jump-starting the sun"-mission is on the table. I ask only that the script to "Sunshine" be placed at the very front of the bomb.The reason that my rating is 2 goes to the fact that "sunshine" regrettably is not the worst movie ever that I have seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd like to go for a walk outside now/But I can't handle the pain!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tasha Robinson over at the AV Club coined the phrase "cast-attrition thriller" to describe this film and it is very apt (so apt I didn't realize she just came up with it). When you come down to it, this film didn't have the courage of its convictions, or the depths of its pretensions (using pretension positively almost to mean "aspiration"). If this film had never involved people running from the sun and burnt-up weirdos and suicide etcetera it would have been much much better. Instead there are a lot of new-age-y generic spiritual statements about sunshine that never amount to anything much beyond "it's real pretty and there might be something more to it than that." None of the characters even have a back-story, much less a story; they all just have allotted traits doled out at about one per person. Aggressive guy, caring girl, moral man, man of science, cowardly lion, ms. ambivalent, etcetera. Then there are some situations which are meant to be meaningful but fall short: if Rose Byrne isn't willing to vote for killing the guy, why doesn't she offer herself instead? Then they can find the other guy has done it already, but take a stand! Another problem is that the character's strange feelings about the sun never spur them to do anything like what happens to the crazy captain of the other ship. No sun ever talks to any of them. The only reason they don't carry out their mission is because their math-guy messes up and doesn't have anyone to double-check his work (which is unlikely). And then Icarus doesn't think it's worthwhile to mention there's a new person on the ship until someone thinks to ask. And how about the psych-screenings for these astronauts? And why can't they just add another 100 years to the timeframe in this or in Minority Report? There's no way we'll have that technology in 50 years.The visuals are spectacular and Boyle certainly knows how to just make a movie entertaining. He delves into his bag of tricks to keep tension during exposition, blasting you with light, near-subliminal cuts, etcetera. While the limitations of the material do not allow for any great performances he at least gets competence all around (even from Chris Evans, who thankfully avoids the case of the Facinellis he's threatening to come down with, although I don't buy him as macho-macho man, he's too short, and while everyone is fawning over his "gravitas" I thought he came across mainly as petulant, they just like his beard).This film really can't avoid comparisons with "Supernova" and "Event Horizon," both of which squander early conceptual strengths by falling back on "picked off one by one" plot mechanics and "trait-allotment" characters then succumb to awful audience-tested or arrived-at-by-committee endings. At least it's better than Soderbergh's "Solaris" remake, "Armageddon" and "The Core." I really wish this film had been directed by Douglas Trumbull or Chris Marker.It's a shame, because "Millions" seemed to suggest Boyle had at last found the consistency that has thus far eluded him from film to film and often within the same movie; it is all the more disappointing because of the great potential in the material. For example: there are hints of a relationship between Capa and Cassie; in the original script there was a "sex in the greenhouse" scene that was cut. So it was either sex or nothing. They couldn't just show them showing affection, or even just huddling close for comfort. Chris Evans' character first volunteers Capa for a life-threatening mission, then sacrifices 2 lives to make sure he's safe. That bipolar blindness comes close to explaining why it fails as a thought-provoking movie, because we aren't really given any reason to believe the sun is really talking to the crazy captain and he never gives an adequate explanation of why it wouldn't want to be re-powered if he's doing its will, it just trusts that he says he's been talking to it so we'll think he might have been and presto: deeper movie with an excuse to rehash old "hunt and peck" tropes. Boyle needs: A) a better writer B) to do more adaptations and C) to make longer movies, strange to say; both this one and "28 Days Later" gave me scriptlash (ooo, I just made that up, too, deeelicious).However, as I said the visuals are stunning (as is the glitchy music), the shots of eyes and the sun never get old, and Murphy's performance as a "greater-good" scientist is pleasingly off-center as always. His best moment in the film: everyone turns to him to make the big important decision that could kill them all and he says, exhaling under his breath?"$#it." This will be remembered as an ultimately unsatisfying film that seems to know it is failing, and tries to make it look like it's failing because it's trying to do too much, when it actually isn't trying to do enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it seems that a lot of ppl have a problem with the captain of icarus 1 turning into a monster. first of all i don't think it is ridiculous at all. i don't see him as turning into god or devil. he basically just became another life form somehow due to all those years in space and it also drove him mad. i think the same thing was happening to Searle his skin started to peel during the middle of the film and he was also fascinated with the rays of the sun. i think everyone in the movie was fascinated with the sun cuz no one has ever been that close to it before. and they all had some kind of connection with the sun in different ways. the movie compared the sun to god. and it totally makes sense. the only reason of our existence is the sun. without the sun nothing would exist. maybe the sun is god who knows. i think it was a good twist in the movie when the captain of icarus 1 boarded the icarus 2. and i think the ending was excellent because the fact that it wasn't clear. maybe they saw god or maybe its just flames from the sun but anyhow it was beautiful. i mean how else could have the film ended? letting them complete the mission and return to earth as heroes and live happily ever after? that would be boring. i think the writer didn't wanna give us an ending that was fixed to a certain point of view. he want us to make out our own interpretations. so those of u who dun wanna watch a film that makes u think better not attempt to watch this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rubbish is too much of a good word for this excuse for a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not impressed by this movie at all. Not in the least. The movie started off quiet well, we all got the basic plot and purpose of the film. Great Wonderful. Then the movie started to get a bit too Star Treky for me. They find the first pay load ship and everyone else died from sun-rays except this one guy...how is that possible...was he meant to be a mutant? Was he fiddled with by aliens? It was as if they ran out of ideas and decided..hey let's make one of the old guys in the first ship live. I will point out how this movie went to rubbish. It all went down when they visited the first pay load ship. First of all, their ship broke away from the landing dock and everyone had to leave by flying through the spaces between both ships...okay fair enough. This super human man who was basically bbq-ed by the sun..how the heck did he get out? There is no way that he could have flew through the air in space because the movie stated clearly that it was massively below 0. One of the guys actually died flying through to get to the other ship! Nonsense. Then as if not to make life worse, the super human is in the observatory where this massive "sun" is being stored and he is already charred and nothing happens to him. BUT one of the other guys can stay in there and has to wear shades and is continuously getting cancer spots on his face. C'mon, how far fetched is that. It would have been much better if it was the computer instead of BBQ man had messed up the mission.This movie is rubbish, pure utter rubbish. They just ran out of ideas while making it. I was very disappointed in it. I love sci-fi but this is really insulting a viewers intelligence. My advice is skip the DVD even, I went to see Meeting the Robinsons with some friends, which had a futuristic twist to it and by far it surpassed this Sunshine nonsense by an infinite number of light years.I give this 3 out of 10 stars as the Chinese lady was devastated when her oxygen plant thing was burnt. It highlighted the plight of the rainforest!! At least it was something to nod at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this film! The visuals looked fantastic, the cast seemed interesting and the soundtrack was by Underworld which sounded promising....Started great...obviously influenced by 2001, Dark Star, Solaris and Alien which is fine by me! I really got into this film...the plot built up nicely, the effects were great, the crew interaction reminded me of Alien (definitely a good thing) and the soundtrack was great - just the right kind of atmosphere (no pun intended) was created.And then....about 2/3 of the way through...it all goes badly wrong. For some unknown reason...lack of ideas? budget? pressure from above? who knows but for some stupid reason they decide to go with the man-on-his-own-goes-crazy-and-kills-the-crew thing...Why??!!! It was building up great - I could have thought of a better idea than what they came up with?!! For gods sake - why did they think making it like Event Horizon would be a good thing (and its not as good as the ending of that to be honest!). It then just gets dafter and dafter and I get more and more depressed. Halfway through this film I had already told myself "I am buying this DVD tomorrow" coz I could tell it was one I would come back to. Half an hour later I was thinking "No way am I buying this nonsense".To sum up....If you want to see a modern sci-fi film that this should have copied (instead of Event Horizon) watch Solaris. Or watch my favourite sci-fi film - Blade Runner. Or watch Alien or 2001. Just don't bother with this - you'll regret it! The soundtrack is a saving grace - I might buy that but I certainly wont be adding this to my sci-fi collection!EDIT!!! OK a couple of years have gone by and I've changed my mind on this one a bit. I've now seen the blu-ray a couple of times and I've decided its a very worth 8/10 now. Its still a little disappointing resorting to the zombie stuff 2/3 of the way through but if you can look past that its a very good film. I still think it could have been a classic though...never mind!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunshine - a good start but a disappointing end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A number of others have made the same point as I have in my summary, so I'll be brief.Sunshine is quite a tidy SF film, with sumptuous visuals far beyond its modest budget, and in its beginning is quite engrossing. The vast ship Icarus II with its glittering golden shield and lovely oxygen garden, "ruled" by the beneficent computer Icarus, is a model of order and control. Of course it would be boring if it became just another milk run, but why could not suspense and interest be generated and maintained in some way other than by the rather formulaic plot ending, (SF=Horror) which results in the crew being picked off one-by-one with the apparently inevitable bloody-handprints-on-the-wall and attendant gore? I think wistfully of Minority Report, I Robot or even The Day The Earth Stood Still.Keeping the baddie semi-hidden results in his being more sinister but I found it particularly annoying that the villain of the piece was only ever shown as though he were a rather badly transmitted hologram, well after his identity became evident.Good but not great SF - 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why are movies about "astronauts" always populated with people that wouldn't pass the psych. profile necessary for setting foot on the ship in the first place? Why do science-fiction screenwriters watch all the great science fiction movies that have gone before and then blatantly rip-off the iconic scenes from each one and string them together in what some people call a script? Why does the fate of mankind ALWAYS come down to the same lame "fist-fight in the engine room"? Why does Sunshine, which starts out okay, degenerate into a bad TV show by the third act? Why do well-respected filmmakers attempt to make science fiction movies when it's clear they really want to do a bad action movie instead? Why does it never seem to occur to movie makers that when a audience pays money to see a space movie, they expect a mind-expanding, intelligent story to unfold, not a "Heroes" episode.Bottom line: If you can't take me where I've never been, show me things I've never seen, make me think things I've never thought, then don't bother leaving earth orbit. Take the money you spent on this movie and build a few wells in Africa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>highly derivative - a wasted opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thoughts having just seen Sunshine: If you go to the trouble of getting the cute, sympathetic female lead all the way through to the final act, give her things to do at the end beyond saying something lame like "Just do it".No more scenes with space crews sat around a table, passing jugs of drink etc PLEASE. The whole hard-bitten crew in claustrophobic ship accommodation thing is getting really old - 2001, Alien, Aliens, Mission to Mars, Event Horizon, Sunshine. All look and feel nearly the same in this area. Yawn.Clear on-ship geography is really important. I had no idea where I was half the time in Sunshine, and it made me stop caring. Big sweeping exterior camera moves all over the place are just a cheat, and they make things look small and fake.Action with the protagonist in a space helmet is problematic. Hard to see his/her face at the same time as anything else.If you're trying to make a hard SF film, don't insult your audience with illogicalities and bad science. Eg right at the start - he is looking at the sun with 2% filtration (something like that). All is very comfortable. Then he dials it up to the limit of 3.1%, and everything is scorchio! But hold on - that's only 50% more?! This is where I got a bad feeling about the script and direction on this movie. Another one was this business about being "in orbit" suddenly. Come on - if you are on a mission into the heart of the sun, you don't suddenly end up in orbit. If things aren't clear to a non-technical audience, then your story is bad. Don't assume you can just run vaguely-technical s**t past them, as if it doesn't matter.If you are going to end up with a main hero protagonist at the end, identify him early on, so the audience can start to invest in him/her asap.Hopefully spaceship exterior styling and interior design can have moved on a bit from the NASA/2001/Ridley Scott mishmash we saw here.Elements of culture and hints of backstory are important to locate a story in the future. We get virtually no clues here.The whole ship's computer thing is also a bit old.If you have a neat little idea (eg the green shoot that Michelle Yeoh finds) - knit it properly into the ongoing story - or dump it. If you just pop it in for the sake of it, and then throw it away, it just becomes a frustration.A weak and pointless villain is worse than no villain at all. Especially if he's just the same as the one from Event Horizon (itself a weak and derivative movie).I didn't HATE it, but I didn't much like it either. It felt like an exercise in hard SF by people who don't actually like hard SF themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts of well but then loses it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whats it about: Sunshine is about a group of Scientists and astronauts who are travelling to the dying Sun with a Nuclear payload in an attempt to restart it and save everyone on earth. They are Humanities last hope as the last mission to the sun failed, the previous ship and crew disappeared, failing to deliver their payload. It starts off well, you have a good cast of actors, good story and great visuals. As the film plays out and you can see the psychological impacts on the characters as the isolation of space and the weight of such an important mission starts to take its toll. Because of this, mistakes are made and stuff starts going wrong with the ship. Its all good you feel tension when people are "Doing there Thing" in attempts to fix the ship.SPOILERS However when the team comes across a distress signal from the first vessel that failed in its mission they, decide to go and investigate.This is where the film becomes Event Horizen 2, on the other ship is a mad man who starts killing the crew one by one. This in itself would not have been too bad. However due poor direction the film changes its shooting style half way through the film. The camera shots become weird and distorted probably in an attempt to add some extra tension but all it does is confuse the audience, as it becomes hard to follow the film. It gets to a point where you can not even follow what is happening on the screen or follow the story because the weirdness of the shots leave you struggling to try and follow the film through to the end.To summarise: The film starts of great but the last 20 minutes let the whole film down. BIG Spoiler(Beware) And a A tip to the director do not tell your audience half way through the film that the whole crew are going to die it just becomes a waiting game on who is going to die next and who will be left till last. I don't mind films where entire casts die but at least leave a little hope that someone will make it, it just makes it more shocking when everyone dies at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Messy Space Opera Implodes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At some point in the future scientists discover the sun is dying and send a team of non-characters on an obvious suicide mission to, well, I guess stop the sun from dying. Yes, the plot of "Sunshine" is that dumb. What's amazing is how dead serious it is all treated by director Danny Boyle. This is one of those sci-fi films where characters stand around talking lots of technical jargon designed to trick viewers into thinking the plot is plausible, and then get overly emotional and start yelling when the mission goes horribly awry.Boyle has always been one of those directors with an obnoxious visual style (lots of hand-held camera work, an obsession with bright whites and golds, and quick-cuts) who somehow manages to tell decent stories. The zombie melodrama "28 Days Later" and the kids flick "Millions" were good in-spite of Boyle's nauseating cinematography. "Sunshine" has no such luck as the story never makes any sense. While it does boast some amazing space visuals of the craft hurtling towards the sun, it's nothing we haven't seen before in a dozen other sci-fi flicks. The special effects, when not subverted completely by Boyle, make the film marginally watchable.The film eventually devolves into "emo" nonsense and has a pointlessly tacked-on horror element thrown in at the last minute for no apparent reason other than Boyle clearly ran out of ideas. "Sunshine" is one of those rare films where I had absolutely no idea what was going on most of the time, but I could see the hideous ending coming from a mile away.</fullReview>

This film, I won't bother to outline the plot again, is really quite odd, in that the effects and sets are of the highest quality, the acting is generally good, but badly let down by an appalling story. We are going to see if we can get our money back from Tesco today, I would never watch it again for sure. The writer's treated the viewer as if they had little scientific knowledge; they made me feel that all they really wanted to do was write a contrived clichéd horror movie set in space. There were so many opportunities to improve the story, but none of them were taken. Being a physicist I could write a lot of points regarding the general theme of the film (restarting the sun!!!) but I don't see the point. If the film is good enough we, as viewers can suspend disbelief, but sadly, Sunshine is just poor.</fullReview>

First of all I should have known it was going to suck when I looked at the OFICIAL website and they tell you right away that nobody survives in this movie. But even with that information I decided to see it. To be honest, up until the last 30 minutes I was not too disappointed. But (another spoiler?) when this movie went from an interesting human interest/sci-fi movie to a horror/slasher flick I lost any and all interest and respect for this film. Somehow, we are supposed to believe that the captain of the original failed mission had miraculously survived seven years after being burned and no longer having any skin. He also seemed to mysteriously develop super human strength and had the belief that it was his job to sabotage any effort to save earth, therefore killing any and all remaining crew of the new mission. It was so stupid that all of us that went to see the movie left shaking our heads wondering how we wasted $11 on this horrible movie. If you are smart, you will avoid this movie like the plague.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't bother: Starts out as A+ drama about group dynamics; descends into stupid monster flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Technically, this has spoilers, but only for the very beginning.This movie could have been so much cooler so easily. Despite the phenomenal casting, this movie wasn't worth the trouble. The basic premise is that the a bunch of astronauts in the not-too-distant future are on a mission to the sun. If they'd left it at that, it wouldn't have been so bad, but I think most of our fourth graders know that when the sun burns out it's going to become a red giant, not a lazy lite-brite.If this movie had been just about the group dynamics, then it would have been fantastic. Something goes critically wrong; whose fault is it? The guy who made the mistake, the guy who made the decision or the guy who had the idea? They could've made this flick a gripping psychological drama easily.Any bomb meant to rejuvenate a sun would need to have more mass than Manhattan Island. It would probably need to have more mass than Jupiter, but while the movie makers may have skimped on the physics, they did their homework on the group dynamics. Any large-scale space mission in the 21st century would have contributors from China, Japan, France, Russia and the U.S. There would be one engineer assigned specifically to the complicated life support system. There would be one psychologist. Even so, tensions would run high for this small, claustrophobic group on a years-long mission.Unfortunately, the version of the movie shown to me at the advanced screening did not linger to explore the ticking human timebomb. It moved on to the standard Ghost Ship/Monster on Board nonsense. Sure, the quasi-religious ravings were somewhat redeeming, but it was still a loss.The most interesting part is established right at the beginning, as Capa sends a message to his parents. No matter what happens on board the Icarus II, no one back on earth will ever find out unless they make it back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has set SF back 40 years.There is little to redeem it.The Physics is utter nonsense from start to finish.The acting is either OTT or wooden depending on the character - a major directorial error. And every hackneyed directorial cliché was invoked, badly, to concoct one of the most predictable and boring movies of all time. It may impress some younger cinema-goers who haven't seen it all before yet, but I doubt it.The one saving grace was the excellent portrayal by Cliff Curtis who must have decided to do his own thing. If he can shine in a disaster like this, with a part well down the pecking order, then watch out Robert De Niro.</fullReview>

Excellent F/X with a terrific musical backdrop by John Murphy Underworld. In the year 2057, the Sun is dying out and an ambitious project has been formed to travel to the sun and detonate a massive thermonuclear device intended to re-ignite it. Seven years earlier another mission was launched but failed. This courageous crew of eight will lose radio contact with Earth, become suspicious of each other and unforeseen circumstances will have them fighting for their lives. If this mission fails, so does existence on Earth. Whenever there is a lull in the action, you are reminded of the loneliness of space. This isn't your run-of-the-mill TV Sci-Fi.

		<shortDescription>A stupid, dumb, badly directed mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Boyle, the director of "Trainspotting" and "28 Days Later", delivers one of the year's stupidest movies. Humans take a spaceship carrying a bomb to the dying sun so they can blow it up and a second sun can be created. If you think that sounds ridiculous, you'll have a bad time laughing at and being bored by this turd. The crew of the Icarus 2 are a boring, one-dimensional bunch you care nothing for. Boyle makes no attempt to sketch their backgrounds, but relies on long looks and pretentious close-ups. His idea of emotional conflict is having two male characters pummel each other while the females look on condescendingly. The special effects dominate and get more and more ludicrous. For example, when the sun finally explodes, the surviving "hero" is not bowled over or annihilated by the blast. Instead, he becomes some sort of god. This is a muddled, unfocused, badly directed misfire. The performances are bland and Boyle arrogantly refuses to explain half the junk he's throwing at us. He's real big on out of focus, smudged images and annoying barrages of sound. In the end, you're left shaking your head and wondering how the hell this rotten script got funded. There is no sunshine to be had here.</fullReview>

You could even have placed the entire cast in a warehouse with a bomb to disarm that would save the world and that would have worked also.To call this movie sci-fi is a little bit of a stretch, it is a psychological thriller based in space and that really does sum this movie up, you could change the environment of the movie and the content would remain the same.I did like this movie don't get me wrong however I was expecting something different, I was expecting a sci-fi "What The ?".The movie did well although I did struggle trying to figure out what the director was trying to convey "Was it about god" "Our relationship with one another" "facing our own demons" "or just a guy going crazy in space"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cgi the only redeeming feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film made me so angry. $50 million to make. Imagine all the script meetings, productions meetings that went into the development of this film. In any of those did no one at any stage do any kind of script analysis? It started with what someone probably imagined was a statement of some philosophical theme - the self in darkness feels itself opposed to the darkness, but the self in light becomes the light.That's it. No further thematic development other than one of the characters thinks dying in the middle of a nuclear explosion would be beautiful. Hmm.No development of character. From memory, the ONLY piece of character illumination is that one character is afraid of dying while another isn't. Deep. Oh yes, and some silly macho play off between two of the characters which never looks like going anywhere, and doesn't.Up to the discovery of the mad stowaway, everything is depressingly predictable. Two guys do a space walk, while everyone inside is going "phew, it's all okay" and we're thinking, one of those guys is going to cop it. It's not that one, so it must be - Yep, there he goes...Then there's the "One of us has got to stay behind and face certain death" bit. "I'll do it, captain." "Gee, we love you, Harvey..." Zzz... there goes another one...But after the discovery of the mad stowaway everything goes apeshit. "There's a saboteur aboard," thinks our hero, "but I'm not going to tell anyone who might help, that would be too simple." And suddenly, for about ten minutes, it's a slasher monster movie, in which we have no reason to care about the characters and little interest in the monster. And the film makers obviously have little interest in the monster either, because suddenly he's gone... and we're assailed with a frenetic sequence of impressive but almost meaningless cgi, of things exploding and crashing into the sun with no explanation whatsoever as what the hell's going on other than computer readouts saying things like "PAYLOAD TURBO INJECTION 00.03.59..." and our hero in a gold suit straining to do stuff that's all very desperate and last ditch, but totally incomprehensible (or maybe if I'd cared, I'd have made more of an effort). Christ, what a long 4 minutes that was. The only film I've ever seen where you're praying for the countdown to disaster to hurry up. Characters die almost without you noticing. You don't care anymore. And then the zero second finally comes and something explodes FANTASTICALLY - but (what? for Christsake!) it isn't the end! - our hero's still there and struggling with something and God knows what that almighty bang was. But now here's the monster again!!! Where did he come from?!! Where has he been?!! (And who is he again?) They're all plummeting into the sun, but for some reason still fighting. Why? Who cares? When the end comes it's nothing but a blessed relief. Is this what films are supposed to do? Am I supposed to feel a small nasty vindictive pleasure at the death of the hero because I won't have to see his meaninglessly unafraid little face again?This film is testament to the pusillanimity of movie execs. Surely it could only be the "big" names of director and writer that could lead anyone not to challenge this half arsed shite. And it is them I blame really. Anyone is capable of disappearing up their own bum now and again and being so hubristic as to create stuff that an average 12 year old would be embarrassed by. But with that amount of money flowing, how could it be allowed to happen? I love film, even many bad films when they have high ambition, but this one left me feeling nothing except a blazing anger which has moved me to writing this. If the execs, writer and director had done their jobs this might have been some deep Solaris-ish meditation, or it might have been a decent adventure flick, but it was just C-R-A-P of the smelliest order, every $ of it an insult both to unproduced scripts of the movie world and the unfed people of the real world.Next day edit now anger has cooled: the idea of a trip to the sun as a way of looking at the way light fuels not only life but our sense of self is an interesting one. Someone might make a decent film out of that idea some day. I think the trouble here is the people who made this film weren't interested enough in the idea to give it what it deserves.The cgi was great though. That why a 2 and not a 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute crock of sh*te</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never felt the need to comment on a film ever before but after just wasting an hour and a half on this rubbish i feel i've got to.I settled down to watch what i imagined would be a good sci-fi film, maybe not amazing but at the very least good. My feeling was reassured when i saw Michelle Yeoh and a couple of other actors I recognised, though could not name, that i would have previously classified as being good actors that acted in good films.And like Claire Danes they all showed me that they are just doing their job and will act in any rubbish that comes their way.People have already outlined everything bad about this film. Confusing, not in not being able to grasp some deep, underlying message, but just in transitions from scene to scene. No tension, no explanations of anything. Oh god it's just awful. I can't even bring myself to waste anymore of my time on this atrocity of a film. If i could give it zero i would. I can't believe this is rated above 7 at the moment on here.Oh and a quick message to whoever decided on the visual style of this film. Film being a visual medium relies on visuals heavily to immerse the viewer in the world they are watching. Having crap blurring effects going on all over the place (for no real reason either!) for the last 20 mins of your film is the equivalent of me writing a book and smearing sh*te over the pages of the last 2 chapters 'for artistic effect'. And the 'subliminal' flickering of other crew. I've never before wished for an emoticon that showed my middle finger being saluted to you.THIS FILM IS CRAP! Clichéd, PRETENTIOUS CRAP!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this film as it recombined the talents of Danny Boyle (director), Alex Garland (writer), and Cilian Murphy (lead actor) from "28 Weeks Later." The idea that Boyle could do for the journey- in-space film what he did for zombies was exciting.However, I can only ascribe the good reviews the result is getting to people who have never seen other science fiction movies or "Outer Limits," much less read anything in the genre. The visuals are from the "2001: A Space Odyssey" school with everything moving at a glacial (read art house) pace, which initially is effective, but eventually becomes simply cumulative. Other parts borrow from "Silent Running," "Event Horizon," "Solaris," "Alien," and pretty much any other film or TV show you can think of featuring a small crew on a large ship undertaking an important mission.Despite pace problems, the first two thirds do build up interest by using one of the best conflicts in s.f. films: man versus the laws of physics. If the film could have kept its focus on the hard choices the laws of nature force on them, it might have achieved greatness. Instead it abandons these conflicts and devolves into clichés, then confusion.All in all, I recommend waiting until the film comes out on DVD. Then you can speed up the visuals a bit, enjoy the middle, and cut to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a meandering, pointless, piece of junk. Don't be fooled by the recognizable actors in this movie, it is crappy, straight to video quality. The premise is pretty far fetched and unbelievable, and the whole thing just seemed kind of thrown together. They don't give enough of a back story or get you to identify with any of the characters. Nothing really sparked my interest, I didn't care what happened next, I just wanted it to be over! I almost walked out half way through, but didn't figure I had anything better to do. In retrospect, anything I had done would have been a wiser expenditure of time. I beg you, don't go see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that this is one of the worse films I've seen in the last few years. Starts OK but later on I got more and more frustrated and irritated and at the end I honestly felt like an idiot. First half of the film was more or less OK, you get to know the characters and their relationship and you find out pieces and pieces of the story and everything seems like an OK film. In the other half you get to know more about the previous mission and the missing ship and crew and this is where the frustrating part starts. You find yourself in the middle of the "Alien" film which has absolutely no meaning for the story. Some weird outcome is happening but they don't explain a bit why it's happening. Nothing at all is explained and although everything seemed quite reasonable until that point, from here to the end of the film I felt like I maybe missed something. But then I took a look round the cinema and I saw that almost everyone had the same expression as I did. The film turned into a horror film and the reason I am so annoyed with it is cause it started as a really intelligent film but then they turned it into a film whose purpose is to shock and nothing else. But I can't say that anyone was shocked, just really confused with the message it leaves. The film has unexplainable and ridiculous story, at least the other half of it. I don't recommend it to anyone who has a sense of logic in the head.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad film, but I've seen much worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's be honest, the cinemas are so full of blockbuster rubbish these days that I went to see this film with a air of snobby expectation. 28 Days later, The Beach and Trainspotting are all films that have taken on and defeated the blockbuster plague and I had high hopes for this.Perhaps it was simply that it didn't live up to this mark that made me so disappointed - or perhaps it was the dreadful final parts that shot the film into my blacklist.To be fair, this film has what so many bad films lack. It has good acting, excellent direction, stunning effects, clever camera work, interesting topics covered and some really good moments, especially early on. However, by the end of the film, we have reverted to full blockbuster mode, with lines tacky enough to put Backdraft to shame, an ending which competes with Pearl Harbour as the worst of all time and a storyline which is not remotely possible, plausible, entertaining or challenging.One review says this film has an excellent study of sanity - but unfortunately, the only sanity I ended up studying was my own. There was a real opportunity here to look at human emotions in tort situations and make an apocalyptic film which examined self sacrifice and heroism in the face of certain Armageddon. Unfortunately, one word lines from the cast don't explore or study those topics in any way. The time saved by cutting down the explanations is then wasted on the ending which is as pointless as it is bad.Sure, worth hiring the DVD, but this isn't worth a cinema visit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story line was totally implausible. It just started with a little narration that was hard to hear over the music as if you had already seen the first part of the story. The science or physics were from someone's imagination also. Any basis for actual fact was in the mind of the writer or story teller? The acting was terrible although it may have been the direction. Directors have a lot to do with the acting. As if that were not bad enough the photography was awful. The images were at times so bright as to be meaningless and at time so dark you had to use your imagination. The action scenes if you could call them that were so out of focus as to be total nonsense. Watch this movie if you like being confused as it made no sense to me.

		<shortDescription>Will there ever be a logical science fiction movie again?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to see this movie - as it had some interesting points - as always I was fearing to see another mindless Hollywood cliché. Actually I cannot remember having seen a completely logical (and complex) sci-fi movie since Kubrick's "Odyssey 2001".And what should I say: complete lack of logical explanations. It's not even so much that the given explanations didn't make sense, it's that mostly they were not given at all, in situations where they sure would have been necessary (for not to make the movie look completely dumb).I was really frustrated by many of these points - in short: (spoiler!)1.) General lack of story telling: How do we get from one situation to another, what happened in between? 2.) What causes the fire in the O2 garden? Why are there no fire extinguishers? Why is there only one garden on such an important mission? (It's the most fundamental rule to have several separated systems if they are sensitive and crucial, and nothing is as sensitive as a miniature ecosystem!)3.) The extinction of the fire in the 02 garden: Why is it necessary to turn the Icarus back to the sun, sacrificing the crew members outside, if the extinction is done by flooding the rooms with O2 (causing everything to burn down)? Why do the crew members have to finish the repairs at that time? (The Icarus was flying with the broken shield before without problems, why can't they turn it back with the shield being only partly repaired and finish it later?)4.) How does the insane guy get from Icarus I to Icarus II? Lets assume he had a suite, still how can he enter? (Somone would have to open a lock)5.) Why do the crew members left back on Icarus I (in the end only the one guy) have to die without the Icarus II protecting it from the sun? The Icarus I had survived for 7 years without the Icarus II - The intact ecosystem in the O2 garden and the insane guy show that humans could survive there without problems. So why did the guy left back suicide by exposing himself to the deadly sunlight in the observation room?6.) How can the Icarus II actually reach the drop point for the bomb, if there is not enough O2 therefore? Even with most of the crew members getting killed by psycho-guy, there is a logical mistake: Either the showdown took place shortly before arriving at the drop point, but then there would not have been enough O2 - or it takes place long before (like suggested) but then they can not be already at the drop point during the showdown which seems to be the case though...All in all sunshine is not a really bad movie - fascinating pictures and ideas, good acting, good art direction and much more. It just makes all the mistakes you have seen in all the sci-fi movies in all the years before...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie, with Danny Boyle directing, Alex Garland writing, and the excellent cast. My hopes were dashed on the rocks of gaping plot holes and awful cinematography.The story follows a crew of astronauts attempting to boost the sun's fading output, this being a second mission after the first ship has gone missing. That summary is the most coherent part of the story; from there on out it just goes downhill. Characters tend to do things for no discernible reason, the camera makes wild swings and cuts, plot holes abound. I'm not just talking about the normal plot holes, but huge, gaping, canyon-sized plot holes which require a suspension of disbelief most usually seen in the advanced stages of delirium tremens.In short, don't watch this unless you're at that advanced stage of drunkenness where you are having trouble finding the remote in your hand. That way you'll pass out before the movie is too far along and be spared watching much of it.I watched this with my girlfriend, who put a beatdown on me after it was over for choosing this movie. My ribs are still bruised, and I blame Danny Boyle and Alex Garland for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, the movie began nice, did not had a look into what happened, just began in space, i thought well something different. Afterwards it became a typical movie where all the crew member had to die of very stupid accidents. They have a spaceship which can go to sun but no simple robots to fix something outside. Anyway there is a lot stupid things no need to count.But what i do not understand is how the movie was cut, no connection between the scenes just jump from one to other. I really have checked the runtime of the movie on IMDb to be sure that i have an original one, cause i thought some scenes were deleted.Normally i don't write comments but this was really bad, and I wont even say something about the ending, it is a question of taste, but I have to say i really don't understand how a movie like this getting 7.3 stars on IMDb. A movie over 7 is normally a great way to spend your time, but not this one, not even close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is without doubt one of the worst films I've seen in recent history. I could have found a better film from the bargain bin in the co-op rather than waste my money on this atrocity. From start to finish I was board to death by the lacklustre and confusing plot line. The directing only aids in the confusion. This surely can't be the same Danny Boyle that directed 28 Days Later and Trainspotting. I think the thing that annoyed me most was the absurdity of the plot line and the fact the writer and director thought I would be stupid enough the believe it. This film is honestly a mockery of anyone's intelligence, even George Bush's. Yes, it is that bad! I don't want to spoil it for anyone who is interested in watching this film but there is a scene near the end which is just like spitting in the face of human intelligence and then kicking it in the delicates. Before seeing this film I went into it with optimism from viewing the trailer and the fact the director previous films were of a high standard. But now I cannot describe how offended I feel by this film. All I can do now is warn people thinking of the watching this film to approach it with caution. If you enjoy then at least your expectations won't have been ruined like mine were.</fullReview>

The plot is lost the minute the crew decides to change course and instead of getting the change calculated by the highly sophisticated HAL -- oops -- whatever the name was -- the course is miscalculated by a crew member -- probably with pencil and notepad.

		<fullReview>When Sunshine started, I was genuinely excited. The premise is superb and potentially makes for a magnificent movie. Everything builds extremely well during the first two thirds, with a constant sense of foreboding and an ever present tension. The effects are outstanding.However, when you get about two thirds of the way through, it's like the writers just gave up. The story becomes borderline absurd and the 'action' so convoluted and poorly navigated you leave feeling extremely disappointed that such a great concept was ultimately so poorly executed. The effects become so distracting the whole thing descends into self-parody.To suggest that the plot is secondary is a nonsense. Everything has to exist within the story presented and the 'hook' of this film is that the beginning is plausible with bags of potential for a fantastic and intelligent story with awesome special effects, but by the end it's become generic sci-fi horror schlock and worthy only of a DVD rental. Shame.</fullReview>

Quite why Boyle didn't recognise this when he read the script and got the writer to make some changes, I really don't know. Although the film teeters on the edge of credibility, Boyle pulled it off for the first three quarters by a combination of nice shots, music and great editing. The acting was passable but not the best element of the film. Then, just when it could have become really interesting if the writer hadn't had a complete brainstorm, it descended into a silly slasher movie, so far removed from any sense of credibility, that the whole thing fell apart. Quite why the writer decided to go in the direction he did is impossible to answer because with a little more thought he could have brought the film to a fantastic conclusion. Instead he destroyed what he had started. What a shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering the pedigree of the filmmakers, Sunshine should have been something quite special. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.Since 'thoughtful' science fiction films (such as the remake of Solaris) haven't of late set the box office alight, it's perhaps not surprising that Boyle and Garland (and quite probably backers Fox) decided to insert some more traditional action-adventure moments to back up the psychological and metaphysical aspects of the story. The problem is that to allow the action scenes to take place, the supposedly 'best of the best' crew have to make really stupid decisions that place them on the same intellectual level as any random doomed teenager from the Friday The 13th films.So the navigator forgets to account for the Sun - the Sun! The huge glowing thing that's the entire point of their mission! - when he makes his course-change calculations. Nobody can stop the computer from taking back control even though this will kill one of the crew outside. Capa doesn't think to use the sunshield control that's right next to him to darken the room when he encounters Pinbacker. Nor does he alert the rest of the crew to the fact that there's an intruder aboard. And so on.Essentially, the film wants to be 2001 or Solaris, while it's actually more like Mission To Mars meets Event Horizon. And at least in Event Horizon, it was possible to see what was supposed to be going on in the final act, rather than every frame being warped or blurred or over-exposed to no effect other than annoyance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was going on in this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie three times, not because it was a great movie but because I genuinely fell asleep the first two times and really had to force myself to watch it the third time just to be able to comment on it properly.If you like artsy, slow moving and weird sci-fi movies then watch it, but after seeing the preview I was expecting a good sci-fi action movie and there were so many things were wrong with this film compared to what I would expect as an average movie watcher.One of the characters says the suns light takes 8 minutes to reach the earth when in fact it takes 8 minutes and 19 seconds, nothing wrong there as this was just a general message to his girlfriend except when you factor in that he and the rest of the crew are science geeks, and science geeks do not generalise to anyone, they use exact facts, this was what first alerted me to sloppy script writing.I also find it hard to imagine that anything can get remotely close to the sun without simply burning up, this includes planets, but the blunders involved with these people were just far too many and the lack of technology to deal with the insurmountable problems did not go hand in hand with the fact that they managed to have a ship that could withstand the awesome power of the sun.There were also too many plot scenarios happening with no explanation, a fire in the garden/plant room is on a list of many and the and the flashed, flickering and blurred camera shots just added to the "what the hell is going on" factor in a movie that was hard enough to follow.Although some people have said that this movie is in the same genre as alien as a sci-fi, I doubt this is the case. Both are dark and moody etc but alien had a clear plot that once set in place flowed through to the end, Sunshine had a clear objective but that became boring and blurred by the constant minor plot changes and the major plot change toward the end that ruined what could have been a fairly good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a modern classic in the sci-fi genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may just be one of those ultra-excited-after-seeing-a-movie moments, but seeing Sunshine is truly a life-affirming experience, because through all the deaths that occur, it ends on a note that is inspiring in a truthful, gut-wrenching way. Edging in as Boyle's best, and at least most visually and ideologically- ambitious film, Sunshine takes science-fiction into the realm of existentialism, and balances out the loss of immediate life with the "big picture". This one being, of course, a star, omnipresent and as mechanical as the Icarus II ship the crew pilot to their targeted destination, reigniting what has been dying with an explosion the size of Manhattan.The characters in this film are not simply the usual lot that one sees where the characters have to go race against the clock to save the world from annihilation and there's the various personalities on the ship and would-be drama and so on. But Boyle takes on such challenges with the gusto of a modern master. The script, by the way, is also extremely rich in how we actually get completely enveloped- as a character might when coming face to face with the sun- in the constant peril because a) they're not one-dimensional twits or walking contrivances, and b) the suspense level is at its highest peak as far as trapped-in-space movies go since Alien (one of Boyle's major influences, as one can tell).But the idea of choice, and bad decisions, and the level of monumental responsibility, is cranked up all the way for these people: that it's not just really all humanity, though there is that, and it's not just planet Earth, though of course there's that as well, but it's as if there's the complex sensation of having to put yourself totally out of the equation, that your own life and the life of the one sitting next to you are as worthless as the last breath taken from a man caught out in space without a suit (one of the most haunting images in the history of contemporary cinema), because of something that is taken so often for granted and is, indeed, something quite abstract. And then, of course, is the character (I won't spoil anything- as it said in the press packet specifically not to) who has become totally immersed in his dementia and loss of all hope by thinking he has a direct line to God.Sci-fi films need good ideas, and in fact ideas that can reach up to the level that the director goes to with his vision, to truly succeed. On its own playing field, Sunshine is as masterful as 2001: A Space Odyssey- and there's even one sequence, probably the only sequence from Kubrick's film that could be called super-suspenseful, that terrifyingly homages it- by navigating along the implications of humanity with a totally exceptional approach to what space has to offer. One might think looking at the sun would get repetitive, but it never is. And as Boyle and his crew go to great lengths to make this move in a seamless manner, there's many a moment of suspense and terror struck up not just by the Alien influence but by more subliminal techniques and sudden shock value (a dream scene where Murphy drifts towards the sun is a knockout), with jump cuts that are as gripping as any of the infected in 28 Days Later.But after considering how much of a sensational movie this is, it fills me with seething anger to think of the double-standard that Fox is practicing in the release date. While I'm not sure how much the film made in England and elsewhere (and by elsewhere I mean the rest of the world, the US is the last to see the film theatrically), it's a downright and lowdown shame that the film is being widely released the same weekend as the Simpsons movie. I plan on seeing both films that weekend if I can, but Fox shouldn't have made that decision for me, in a sense. They could have made this one of the biggest summer blockbusters- a thinking man's blockbuster, even more accessible than (if not as heartbreaking as) Rescue Dawn- and instead are cramming it into an already busy play-list...And yet this goes without saying the Fox Searchlight logo contributes to one of the greatest opening shots in recent memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunshine is a health hazard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't you know? Sunlight can be dangerous to one's health -- as can this maudlin masturbatory excuse of a film.Every cliché and mundane subplot in the book seems to exist in some form within this garbled mess of a motion picture. Fusing pretentious philosophy with trite horror / slasher conventions, and seasoning with absurd "science" for good (bad?) measure, "Sunshine" is an utterly preposterous entry in the Science Fiction canon. While the likes of "Metropolis" and "2001" don't come along every day, "Sunshine" isn't even fit to the wipe the shoes of lesser but more competent fare like "Total Recall" and "The Matrix". File this under your "Supernova" folder (viewers of THAT film will know what I mean): it's just bad.Although people rave about Danny Boyle's seminal "Trainspotting", that film derived much of its power from the book, which was and is truly astonishing -- the film just had the sense of mind to retain its spirit with good actors, snappy editing and clever set pieces (e.g. Ewan McGregor's character falling through the carpet in a trippy heroin-loaded sequence). Unfortunately, aside from a clever title sequence and one scene that's genuinely funny (sadly hinting at a superior film that never was), none of the same wit or flair is on display here. Boyle has proved himself to be a fairly average director who NEEDS already-strong source material to make a passable film. Here, he simply took a bad project and made a bad film. An early warning sign reveals all: no attempt is made to explain why the sun is dying or how the bomb to "repower" it (or whatever) actually works -- and why? Not because it isn't needed (though that's an interesting, albeit silly, potential defence), but because the makers clearly had NO BLOODY IDEA how to pull it off. If you build a house on weak foundations, it isn't going to stand. Great visual effects are not enough. In other words, they made a turkey, and dressed their whore of a film up with glitter in the hopes you wouldn't notice.To give an example of how loopy this film is: Aside from the heavy-handed absurdity of naming a space vessel on a desperate mission to the sun "Icarus" (not to mention calling an expanse of space around the sun "the dead zone" -- HOHOHO!), there is a ridiculous subplot, arguably the main plot since it occurs early on and sets everything in motion, in which it is decided that a rescue mission of the earlier Icarus vessel (that's right, the ship we start with is the SECOND iteration) should be mounted, if only to salvage its extra payload (i.e. two bombs for the price of one). The filmmakers present this choice as a serious one -- even though a mission of this importance would have been planned meticulously from scratch. The original craft is already presumed lost / destroyed when we begin the narrative with the second; why would there be any reason for the characters to even think about changing course and picking up a second bomb? Yet we're treated, if "treated" is the right word, to a completely pointless and insulting scene in which the physicist -- the guy tasked with making the decision to alter course or not (because he's the physicist 'n all: shut up and don't ask questions!) -- is shown running a simulation with the on-board computer to decide. But this simulation is merely a rendering of the Icarus crew's own bomb journeying to the sun. The scene tries to convey the uncertainty of the mission and the weight that rests on one man's shoulders, but it's totally superfluous. This simulation would have been run a million times before the craft was even built. We're just left to watch a no-name character make a dramatically hollow decision based on a nice but completely pointless piece of eye candy. And that's really "Sunshine" in a nutshell.Five minutes in, I sat in the cinema WANTING these characters to die -- anything to end the tedium. Not one of them showed an ATOM of dignity, intelligence, wit, tenacity, personality or humanity. They were 20 and 30-something bland ciphers -- not master astronauts, men and women combined, selected for their extreme mastery of their hearts and minds. A mission of such profound significance would require the best of the best; not barely-composed, thinly-drawn bickering nobodies you wouldn't expect to operate a toaster correctly, let alone produce a single thought of worthy recognition. This film was little more than "Big Brother" in space, with depth and intrigue to match. Even though Ron Howard jarringly inserted a scene of the three lunar astronauts fighting in "Apollo 13" (a fictional embellishment), he also had the good grace to show them as careful, stoic, collected human beings doing an important job, not egotistical, suicidal, sweaty-faced nerve balls ready to jump every time a pin dropped. Of course, a film doesn't have to have interesting characters, but it sure helps. "2001" is notable for its insipid human characters, but in that film, the depiction is very deliberate and is carefully counterbalanced with the delirious HAL. Humans are trivial specks in "2001": small fish in a VERY big pond. The immensity of the cosmos, of existence itself, is contrasted with the mortal shells (i.e. our bodies) in which our consciousness, reaching for something greater, resides. "2001" is profound. Even the dialogue is meted out with great care -- less is more. But "Sunshine" is far too literal. Characters discuss course diversions, alarms, oxygen levels and various mundanities, not to mention constantly fret and argue, for no other reason than to advance the plot. There is no subtlety or art here. "Sunshine" is a photonic waste. Does anyone else remember when cinema used to be good?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is mostly padded to kill time, like an author pads a book to fill empty pages. Instead of being padded with junk words it is padded with bullshit boring ass scenes that have nothing to do with the story. My first instinct was to stop watching but I saw the move got a fair rating so I continued watching to see if it would get better as the movie progressed, but it didn't, so eventually I started to fast forward to see if the movie got better. At the very end when the movie is almost over the story actually begins by which time I am so disgusted with the movie that I end it as I can watch no further. It seems to me some one paid to have positive reviews written as is with many of these movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mediocre space movie is absolutely not worth seeing in 2015.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its set in a massive space station like in Alien, but without any of the good stuff like good characters, dialogue and acting. Its all so mechanical. There's nowhere near enough time spent on non-plot stuff which might make us care about these people. There's no personal stakes involved. We aren't invested in Cillian Murphy's message home, we don't see anyone's home life, and the acting is all so wooden that we just don't really care what happens. Awkward dialogue, delivered in a stilted way; both screenwriter and director are to blame. Sadly, part of the problem stems from actors who don't speak English natively or smoothly, and struggle to create a realistic dynamic on set.Rose Byrne is the only exception to this. She's good, but she's not given much to do. 1/10 Overrated. A mediocre space movie is absolutely not worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sun doesn't shine on everyone equally, or A tale of Big Sister and Little Brother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sun is Earth's common property - it is, however, no human law that it shines more over, say, the Sahara Desert, and less, say, Reykjavik, so it is in a way a naturally biased distribution that living beings have learned to adapt to. Still, human beings seem to remain an exception. In this sci-fi installment about a mission on the way to save the dying Sun, the closer they get to the source of sunshine, the longer the shadows of the unconscious that prove how deeply the natural unfairness (as seen on the example of the Sun not shining equally on everyone) has shaped the cultural unfairness of the human beings. This movie says it with the utmost clarity: if there is anyone who needs to die first, it's going to be non-white people. Let's see: the first to go is an Asian, followed by a conveniently exotic (Maori)-looking native, then another Asian, then en passant one undistinguished character easily taken for a Latino, and finally another Asian. The survivors are all impeccably white saviors of the day.Interesting about this racial constellation is that it is seemingly totally arbitrary, i.e. no character actually offers any clue as to why he or she has been chosen for that certain task. A Maori is as good a psychologist as he would have been a captain, and a Japanese as good a captain as he would have been a biologist etc. On this level, the movie pretends well to merely incidentally kill off the non-white people first since that could have befallen anyone. But there is another level of the movie that shows a much more structured and conscious acting-out of antinomies of the human psyche. This becomes apparent first in a somewhat veiled way: when one of the crew, a male physicist, records a video message to his "loved ones", it is noticeable that there is no "girlfriend" there. We are thus made aware that there are absolutely no sexual issues addressed in the interactions of the crew. No-one has a boner, no-one has a crush on anyone, and no-one seems to have any boyfriends and girlfriends. This is, however, crucial to understanding of the movie's finale. There is, namely, one "excessive" member of the crew that seems to transcend their limitations as experts in the field, and subtly knows more than they with their post-PhD level of knowledge. This member is the female Icarus, all-knowing voiced computer that provides them with all sorts of data, from their personalities to heliophysics. But contrary to the expectations, this time the computer is not the antagonist to the humans, but to its own kin - God (in fact, another "excessive" member on board!). The introduction of God happens here in a cinematically rather muddled way, but the idea is here: God is a destructive, fiery force that won't let any mortal approach it without fatal consequences. The point here, however, is that God got it all wrong. It's not the humans that he must fight with, but the Voice of Wisdom that transcends them and guides them impersonated as a computer. He must fight with Sophia, the Supreme Knowledge that endangers His inflated ego who thinks that He is the one and only God that people should awe and praise, and doesn't want them to know that She existed way before Himself! That is to say, God does try to make an impression on humans by doing His various fire tricks, but in the eyes of Wisdom - His Big Sister - He is exactly that: her Little Brother! Little Brother that throws tantrums that may scare humans, but more or less just annoys His Big Sister. He is a constellation of many folks' mythologies where God as the little brother wrecks havoc on Earth just out of mischief, but is eventually subdued or punished by his big sister (like Amaterasu and Susano-o in Japanese mythology - since the captain of the crew is a Japanese). So the crew is just a vehicle for the fight between two opposing transcendental forces which, however, are not complimentary as in a love relationship, but hierarchical and characterized by stages of psychological development: older Big Sister, the Computer, who is wise , all-knowing and reliable, and younger Little Brother, God, who is immature, conceited and destructive. That is why there are no sexual relationships between the members of the crew, and that is also why the last message from the Sun to the Earth is that from brother to sister. This message acts as a point of reference for the movie's own flawed dramaturgy: killing off non-white people first is an act of religious prejudice ignited and sustained by immature, intolerant God, but making it known exactly by the way of introducing a point of (transcendent) reference is an act of confession how wrong God is, and how humans would be better off had they listened more to the Wisdom, His Big Sister.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my absolute favorite movie of all time until something else similar comes along. Before the existence of this story, my favorite was James Cameron's The Abyss. I used to loop the playback of Sunshine over and over to the point I could recite the script word for word while the movie was playing not unlike what my niece and nephews would do with The Lion King. I actually did really good in my physics and science classes because of this story and passed with good grades because I was so inspired.I could write a thousand page novel on what I like about this story just like those thousand page long books that get you excited with what's right around the corner and keep you up all night. No spoilers here from me although I am tempted. It's a philosophical science fiction thriller with a whole lot of humanity, the good and the bad. Very much like how Danny Boyle injected humanity into 28 Days Later and Slumdog Millionaire. Give this story a chance and check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm writing this review in large part to shake my head at the people who've panned it. How could anyone not at least find it very entertaining? Are some people just born to gripe?The only weaknesses I found were a lack of scientific explanation for the sun-dimming phenomenon, some confusing moments where you didn't quite know what the ship was doing, plus the villain aspect may have been a bit overplayed in hindsight. But it hardly made a dent in the overall quality.I think it was wise to not muddle the plot with earthbound flashbacks. The idea was to be totally absorbed in the moment and it worked.This is nearly as good as "2001: A Space Odyssey," in my opinion. Excellent use of atmosphere vs. the campy/military-style drama that weakens so many of these movies. The soundtrack also created the atmosphere in itself. Much better than canned action scores which merely launch Earth dramas into space.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

I can't think of one sci-fi I've ever seen that is so intensely deep. Though the ultimate conclusions of the question posed by it are ambiguous, enabling viewers of any beliefs to find it applicable, it is deeply profound and moving. With an excellent musical score and some phenomenal acting, which employed some interesting method acting techniques, the drama on screen is as intense as one could hope for. Overall the drama of the dark atmosphere, psychologically and physically challenged characters, and deadly setting make it a powerful piece of science fiction that is deeply rewarding to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few movies have left me as breathless as Sunshine did.After first seeing it in cinemas at the age of 11, I didn't quite get what the movie was getting at, I thought it was trying to hard to look good, and found it a bit boring. but upon re-watching it, I have come to realize just how well it blends fact and fiction.In the core of the movie, is a plot that is about as rock solid as they come, the crew of the Icarus II is on their way to the failing sun to deliver a payload that will explode and create a new sun from within the old one, but the crazed captain of the Icarus I wishes to stop them, as he has "spoken to god". The plot does well in how inflicting beliefs can on others can affect more than we often realize. somewhere between a sci-fi, slasher or disaster movie is where Sunshine lies.The movie is acted well on a hole, although not surpassing other greats (Such as Die Hard and Pulp Fiction) I felt emotionally moved when big events transpired that affected the characters, I believe this is also due to the stunning cinematography and moody droning music which has been a staple of sci-fi for so long.In short, Sunshine is an amazing movie, from beginning to end.</fullReview>

It's just that there is no action until the end. I don't like falling asleep in movies especially science fiction ones.This is about a group of astronauts who are headed to the dying sun and their mission is to revive the sun by bombing the sun.The acting is phenomenal. Most of the actors are not big names but most are recognizable. I liked Chris Evans and Cillian Murphy.If there was more action, I would have loved it. But unfortunately that's not the case.

		<fullReview>SOME VERY VERY BIG SPOILERS BELLOW! DO NOT READ IF YOU DIDN'T WATCH!This film came to me as one of the biggest surprises of the year 2007. I mean... what can you expect from a movie where a group of astronauts has to save the world (or maybe better... the Solar system) by giving the nuclear bomb "massage" to a dying Sun. (Hmph) I must admit I was very skeptical about it, but in the end I decided to give it a try because Danny Boyle is one of my favorite directors, and his collaboration with Alex Garland gave exceptional results in 2001 with modern zombie-horror hit "28 days latter". I expected it to be a pathetic sci-fi drama with some original directing and imaginative photography. What I got was something else... Yes, it was drama, but not pathetic at all. The feelings, motives, and interactions between crew members were so real and logical that for a moment there I thought I was with them there, in dark and cold space. Even though they were determined and ready to die for their cause I couldn't help not to feel desperate for their fate (because, somehow, you know what's gonna happen in the end from the very beginning). The tone of the movie is very dark and gloomy, and Alex managed to give us some transcendental and dreamy dialogs. Boyle's directing is fantastic, as always.. and all cast did an excellent job (with Cillian Murphy being a bit better than the other, of course). What else can I say... Oh yeah... Sorry if I made some mistakes, my English is still not as good as it should be :P...</fullReview>

The art direction was as solid as the storyline. the colors of beauty mixed in with the blackness of space. The movie was not too cheezy for a sci-fi flick, which wasn't what I expected.

		<shortDescription>True Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a true sci-fi epic unlike anything else I've seen. Danny Boyle hits us once again with a film of pure beauty twinned with thrills and chills. It gets the adrenaline pumping around your body, while at the same time getting the adrenaline pumping around your brain. If you have a closed-minded view on how films should be, or need everything explained to you, this isn't the film for you. I watched it in the cinema and was taken aback by the beautiful visual effects and emotional soundscapes. The enlightenment of Searle really makes you think as does the the introduction of Pinbacker. As Capa goes to release the bomb in the grand finale, I really felt the sense of struggle and determination. The feeling of doom and debate of humanity is really strongly felt between all the characters and you can't help but dread what it would be like to be in their shoes. John Murphy and Underworld do a great job with the soundtrack, emphasising and sometimes creating the feeling of hope and despair in equal measure. Cillian Murphy is once again at top form. He really seems to have a hold on Capa's good-natured, but human character. Mark Strong is also very chilling and Rose Byrne remains her innocent-looking self. The story is unpredictable, thrilling and at times confusing, but with confusion also comes the silence in the room as the credits roll, because everyone starts running the movie back in their heads trying to figure it all out. Danny Boyles directing is, as always, fantastic and the composition of the visuals, script, acting and soundtrack is near perfect. Sunshine really goes to show how much of a versatile filmmaker he is.This film ticks all the right boxes for me, but it's not for everyone.</fullReview>

There are good moments of suspense and tension too. As I said before the final part is bad and disappointing not because the idea of the end was bad (I think it was good), but for the surreal way that it was developed which I hate because I had found the film fascinating until that moment.The plot is about a group of scientist who travel toward the sun, which is dying, at the ship Icarus II to throw a bomb to the sun (to revive it), having only one chance to do it right and if they achieve that goal life will be able to go on at earth.I recommend watching this movie because it's entertaining, in spite of its weak final.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An above average sci-fi film with a disappointing ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From horror director Danny Boyle of England of "28 Days" fame, comes this science fiction film. It features a rather unique and original story idea. The year is 2050 and the sun is dying. There is a manned mission to the sun to deliver a theoretically designed nuclear bomb to "re-ignite" our dying sun. The first mission named "Icarus" is abandoned after no contact after 7 years. So, a second manned mission "Icarus II" is launched to complete the original objective. That is where this film begins."Sunshine" is a visually stunning film with a unique and original story idea. The story idea of this film begs the question: Why a manned mission to the sun? Humans have successfully sent landers to Mercury, Venus, and Mars. Wouldn't a manned mission to the sun be considered very dangerous and impractical? Life support would be needed for the human crew aboard. OK, I thought about this when I first viewed the film, and decided to accept this implausibility. Without this story idea, there would be no "Sunshine", of course.I was impressed by the visuals of the film and the original story idea was working, that is, until near the end of the film. The first 3/4 of this film is very good film-making. There is genuine tension between the characters. Much better than usual for the sci-fi film genre. The characters and story were believable and natural for most of the film. Near the end, the film makes a radical story departure and goes off into a modern style horror film. This was really disappointing to experience. It's like a the race of a favored horse doing very well, leading the pack approaching the finish line, looking like a winner, and then suddenly something unexpectedly goes wrong.Danny Boyle had some great elements all working together in this sci-fi film and he blows it at the end. The logical and engaging story suddenly goes off into a crazy direction, with a cheap, throwaway B movie horror plot.It's worth noting this film, made in London, costs only 20 million pounds, and achieves greats visuals. This is only a fraction of what Hollywood spends on an epic scale film. I commend all the makers of this film for delivering an impressive looking film on a relatively small budget.I'm a science fan and film buff who realizes that the sci-fi film genre has a bad history. This film starts out with great potential to rise above the usual mediocre quality of current and recent sci-fi films. Director Danny Boyle credits "Alien" and "the classic "2001: A Space Odyssey" as inspiration for this film. Well Mr. Boyle, you started this film very well and then you blow it, with a cheap horror film plot thrown in at the end. I hope you will do better, if you make another sci-fi film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive Sci-Fi turning to Horror ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film last night and was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting it to be Solaris with a little action ? it is but also much more. If I were to compare it to any films I would say it's a mix of Solaris (which I found slow), Event Horizon (thought it was a great horror sci-fi) and a little of 2001 Space Odyssey. The film follows a crew of 8 on a mission to re-ignite our dying star the sun which has been fading and consequently caused many problems for the population of earth. The film centres around the crew and the mission, so don't expect to see some disaster movie Hollywood stuff on earth. What I liked about this film was its characters and how they dealt with potential impending doom and also what happens to them all and the sacrifices they make. I was suitably impressed with the camera shots and musical score, in the wrong hands I think this film could have been awful. All you have to do is accept the glaring error that humanity in just 50 years from now could have the technology to travel to the sun in a crewed space ship and have a device powerful enough to re-ignite something so huge as our sun ?? if you can accept that flaw (which I did from the start) you should enjoy the film and be surprised as I was. Enjoy.</fullReview>

Carrying a payload of nuclear material equivalent to Manhattan. Carrying a crew more diverse than a college dorm. A full of more problems than one could expect. Many bash this film for some plot elements but I think that Sunshine really does hit home on a important issue that is very realistic in today's society. Do you sacrifice your own beliefs for what is morally right. What are the lives of a few compared to that of billions on earth. We all know that religion has done some crazy things with people in the past so you really can't deny it as plausible. I mean the Dark Ages, Witch Hunts, the New Middle Eastern Muslim movement against all others. Its simply amazing what people will do in the face of their god, and sunshine hits home with a depiction of that. Simply put the movie is a great Sci-Fi with an invigorating story and a great cast. It is enough to even have non sci-fi fans turning their heads to view and if your intellectual enough to get the deeper meaning will leave you thinking.The weakest point about the movie is the plausibility which leaves people thinking could a nuke only that big really do that much to a star so much larger than earth let alone Manhattan. Other than that Sunshine is a unique thriller that I recommend to anyone, and quite possibly could be the only film I enjoy Chris Evans type cast as a cocky jackass American.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trying to be too much at one time, SUNSHINE often fizzles and fades under the shadow of its own weight.The biggest letdown is the cast. Not necessarily the actors themselves but how little we're able to identify with any of them in any way. When characters began dying off, I felt nothing for them. It was also frequently confusing trying to figure out who had what job and why ("I thought he was the captain?"). Chris Evans (FANTASTIC FOUR) plays more of a tough-guy "crewman 19" scenario than anything else. Cliff Curtis (THE FOUNTAIN) plays a psychologically unbalanced doctor who only likes to stare at the sun as much as possible. Michelle Yeoh (MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA) I'm guessing was some sort of astro-botanist obsessed with her shipboard crops. Cillian Murphy (BREAKFAST ON PLUTO) is the only character most viewers will come close to feeling anything toward. He plays resident physicist Robert Capa who's responsible for their ships precious cargo; one designed to reignite our dimming sun. His seemingly over-importance is hit on time and again since "he's the only one that knows how to ignite the payload." For such an important mission, I would've thought that whatever space agency was involved in this mission would've sent at least a few other people along who knew his job in case something happened to him (credibility issue).But for all its lackluster character portrayals, Sunshine does have some stunning visuals. A space walk by two members of the ship (known as Icarus 2) is candy for the eyes, with wisps of solar energy licking around the dome-shaped ship and threatening them. A few dream sequences with Cillian Murphy's character falling into the sun are also fascinating and creepy.Much time in the film is given over to the discovery of their failed predecessor, the Icarus 1, and its discovery by the crew of Icarus 2. A connection is supposed to be made by the audience between these two ill-fated crews. The connection is supposed to be the fragile minds that begin fracturing as they approach the sun. Is it some sort of space/sun-spot dementia/psychosis? Or is there really a threat to the Icarus 2 via the Icarus 1? I'm not going to spoil that for you, so you'll have to check it out for yourself.The final problem with Sunshine is that it was directed by Danny Boyle. Boyle is more recognizable now as a successful director of horror since his acclaimed connection with 28 DAYS LATER. Unfortunately, some horror aspects show up in Sunshine and this is where things really get messy for the film. Dipping into so many genres that it blurs its purpose (sci-fi, psychological, horror, drama), Sunshine doesn't shine much in any of them.With the exception of some great scenes that have little or nothing to do with the characters, this movie won't ignite most movie-watchers' imaginations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really, I was expecting more form this movie. There were a lot of instances where it was a stretch to believe these characters were astronauts. The plot was lacking solid science. I am sooo glad I rented this than buying it. And, since I have Blockbuster and go through about 9 DVDs a week, it was no great loss. My biggest problem with this movie was that none of the astronauts thought to check the calculations. Come on, every astronaut has the technical background to double check the math. Also, why was Capa the only one capable of detonating the bomb. I kept on making fun of the suits and then read gundognc's review, "Gold lame space suits are in". Too funny. Another problem with the science of this movie is the bomb. Even if the bomb was the size of the Earth, it would be like a 1' meteor hitting the Earth. The Sun is 1.4x10^6 km, the bomb is a couple of km. The Sun is a 10x10^9 year old thermonuclear bomb. It's like throwing a firecracker into a White Sands test to give it more umph. It's not a total loss but I was disappointed when the last 1/4 of the movie went from sci-fi to horror. 'You can't fix stupid.' RW</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could not believe it. I had been warned in advance that I would not understand the plot (and I wasn't being insulted),but that was an understatement.After a very long and boring attempt at a build up of tension - and that was hard considering I was finding it difficult to follow the clichéd '138 to 193, over' dialogue - I noticed that the film hotted up when they finally got to the sun.After that, I haven't got a clue: in fact I didn't have one before that. All I saw was a pathetic attempt by Boyle to create another masterpiece within the genre - hence the over-blown '2001 - A Space Odyssey' style images and the camaraderie crew rubbish, just like in the 'Alien' movies. I then saw echoes of 'Event Horizon' when the Hellraiser lookalikey showed up from Icarus 1. A waste of time watching this pretentious, over-hyped garbage. The whole thing irritated me.</fullReview>

I would like to take the opportunity to make a brief comment regarding it's entertainment value. Like many, I review this site to support my Movie selections. There is nothing new or exceptional here, in any form. I have to say the plot in this case was silly and the long boring dialog did not help its purpose. There is no real substance in character or plot for the viewer to hold on to. Without spoiling the story for Sci-fi fanatics, I found the progression very predictable. The viewer will not experience apprehension should they leave the room on occasion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very entertaining and incredibly photographed sci-fi film, easily the best of recent memory. The film only stumbles in it's slightly over-the-top, somewhat predictable third act, but is redeemed by a magnificent final shot. Visually, the film is a real treat... easily comparable to classics such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Alien. The visual effects are beautiful and very impressive for a film with a fairly modest budget. While some may say the film borrows too much from past sci-fi pictures, and there are some obvious comparisons, Sunshine still feels fresh. This had a very quiet theatrical run, hopefully it finds the audience it deserves on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My advice for you, if you haven't seen the movie yet: Don't care of the reviews and comments. I for my part really don't care if this is a good sci-fi movie, or if it is scientifically correct or whatever. This is a beautiful movie about 8 people living under extraordinary conditions, it is full of wonderful pictures, the actors (which are for me some of the most promising young actors in these days) are doing an incredibly good job and the soundtrack's atmosphere fits the visuals... That's all that matters to me and makes me put this movies to my favorites next to (newer ones) "The Fountain" and "28 days (&amp; weeks) later" (which are also wonderful movies to me, i don't care of if it's a horror movie or not).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunshine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film, the storyline begins a bit slow, however gives you the proper introduction to the plot and a chance to identify with a crew of 8 whom have been in space together for 16 months. Their mission is important, re-ignite a dying out star as mankind faces extinction. Theirs is the second such mission and they do not know why or how the first ship/mission failed. The cast is perfectly balanced, and each member has a specific purpose and responsibility. When the mission runs into trouble each crew member reacts differently and is 'tested' emotionally and psychologically. There is conflict and suspense and the build to the climax is gradual as you follow the events. I'm sorry but I fault the director of photography for doing a very poor job on some of the most important aspects of the climax. Thus a lower rating of 7 as opposed to 9 or 10. The acting was superb, the momentum of the plot was good. But the photography depicting some scenes was atrociously 'BAD' and may give you a headache in some spots or annoy you as you try to focus on what is occurring in the scene. POOR Job on the photography albet it 'was' an attempt for a unique and different approach. SOME, scenes however were beautifully shot, but the most suspenseful scenes shot VERY BADLY. Unfortunately this photography fact alone will be what 'kills' the movie experience for a lot of people, as you may come away frustrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>100% Thriller, 30% Sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that distinguishes the Sci-Fi movies from the rest is that they have to seem if not real, then at least possible. In this movie a lot of things are unexplained or just wrong (oxygen+fire=?). The too many mistakes annoy real Sci-Fi fans. Or let's make it more simple: In moments that your brain doubts that something is possible and they give you some stupid explanation, you just wave with your hand and say to your brain:"OK, OK - big deal, just let me watch the movie". But when this thing happens every 5 minutes, you just stop enjoying the movie, and watch and wait to see the ending.Well, they really made shure that you will not leave your seat. The good sound helped a lot for that, although I secretly hoped for real mute space. The Thriller in this movie is really thrilling, and scary although in some parts it's so unclear what exactly is happening, that you get tired of stareing at the screen, hoping to figure out what is what. If you forget that you are watching a "Sci-Fi Thriller", and pretend you're watching only a "Thriller", than you'll like it for shure!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie left me speechless as I was leaving the theater. Danny Boyle is a genius. The first time I heard of the movie, it sounded like one of those that you cant decide to see because you have no idea how corny it will be but then you look at who directed and realize that this director is solid. The one thing I can complain about: the beginning is a little slow. Amazing but slow. Thats pretty much it. The movie combined an epic scifi journey to save mankind to a megalomaniac killer horror flick. The camera work is very stylized giving you a sense of vertigo in certain shots and a very unmistakable similarities to 28 days later.( in regards to camera) The slanted angles and shuttering effects leave any movie junkie mystified. I love it I love it I love it. As for the CGI, It was very good. I wouldn't say that it was revolutionary, but it was good. I don't know much on the subject so I wont dig myself a hole. The dialogue was great and the movie never drags. It is amazing what can happen because of a single choice</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Sci Fi/Horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all let me say, don;t pay attention to all the negative reviews. I know there are more positive than negative, but still forget about the negative reviews. This is a class act for science fiction/horror films. The film is fast paced which never really leaves you sitting there thinking, "man, when is something going to happen?" There is always something going on and usually for the worst. That is what I love is that there is no time for laughing. This movie starts with gloom and keeps it going throughout. As far as comparing it to Event Horozin, well it is a little similar but way different. You will understand when you see it. As far as scientific stuff and all that..Man its a movie suspend some of what you know for the sake of a good movie. I don't think they ever explain how they have gravity on the ship, but I really didn't care. I just said to myself maybe they figured out a way to simulate gravity. The score is great and the acting is first rate. Danny Boyle has really established himself as a versatile director and I look forward to whatever he makes next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning sunny images</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hot out there, global warming and all, but taking a nuclear payload into the sun, now that's very hot. So the crew of the Icarus II (that name can tell you about human aspirations, and make you ask about Icarus I) in Sunshine, set in 2057, has the job of restarting the moribund star or facing the extinction of the planet.It's an exciting film, regardless of your ability to predict what will happen. Part Solaris, part 2001, a bit of Alien, it combines stunning cinematography and music (The Starship Enterprise's holodeck, 2001's classical-type music) with a clone computer of Hal and an unusual presence aboard ship. The flight to the sun is hottest with the different personalities among the culturally diverse crew, among whom tension builds over survival in and out of the ship. With all the sophisticated electronics aboard, it's nice that in the end human strength and weakness determines fate, not wiring.Perhaps the most stunning images are those facing the sun, on an observation platform where filtering allows the crew to view the monster star regularly. Again, issues about oxygen trump heat, and time trumps technology. Sunshine continually returns to basic human challenges regardless of how many millions of mile away people are.The film falters at the end, where the mission's success is more important than the fate of the characters, where introduction of new complications takes precedence over resolution of enduring problems, human and technological. The denouement is compressed in time and images, a potpourri of quick cuts and parallel action to create a chaos that need not have dominated the images. Throughout, however, director Boyle does standard good cinema things like put a camera inside the helmets of the two astronauts repairing the ship from the outside. The pov is rewarding."Science fiction writers foresee the inevitable, and although problems and catastrophes may be inevitable, solutions are not." Isaac Asimov</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typified space-shuttle action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though some reviews in the newspapers would give much credit to this movie, I on the other hand, do not really agree with its uniqueness. With almost much similarity towards Armaggedon, the mission is similar in many ways; we're all gonna die from a huge rock which will come into contact with Earth with regards to Armaggedon whereas it is from the dying out of the sun's energy that will freeze us all on Earth in the movie Sunshine. A team of drillers in Armaggedon was sent to the heart of the rock to drill a hole deep enough so as to place a detonator within it and blast it off before it hits the third rock from the sun. With Sunshine, the mission is to place the detonator in within the heart of the Sun (apparently it is automated to detonate by itself after finding its own way to the epicenter and core of the Sun)... Right... Facts of physics are at least adhered, in which they kept the sun from being too strong so as not to melt any devices that would go near it (and by that I would mean a few million kilometers no doubt). After all, that's the main idea for the movie... Sun's losing it's shine, and we're all gonna die unless someone would go up there and do something.Well they did, 7 years ago, a spaceship known as Icarus went up there in a mission to carry out what I just mentioned; but failed seemingly without any contact thereafter. 7 years later, another team of astronauts, scientists, physicists and navigators were sent up there again with the new spaceship of Icarus II to carry out of what's left behind. Halfway there, they found Icarus I and decided on whether to stop by and check it out or to deploy their payload in the sun. Problems and mishaps happen time and again, after all, where would be the suspense then if they don't keep it that way. Hence, you would have expected that in any spacecrafts movie, need I mention things like Apollo 13, Armaggedon and even Star Wars? Ahahaha... but that aside, that shouldn't be the main critics of this movie, as you will need that for suspense, however a sense of originality ought to have been kept and used.If you were to notice, people up there have to sacrifice their lives for others, by probably staying behind (like Bruce Willis who did so in Armaggedon), which indirectly allows for less people, more share of oxygen supply to lead them towards their destination to carry out their mission. Somehow, things go real bad halfway into the movie, and viewers will be introduced to various kinds of explosions, shortages of supplies, damages, human errors and stupidity over their political leadership in within the ship. All of this would bring about a good suspenseful and tearful enough movie to keep you on your seats and your face warm with tears. Oh, you would feel touched alright, if for the sake of those who has never had the chance of viewing Armaggedon. You should probably get some tissues, coz yeah, some of the deaths you will see will provoke you while some will give you the affirmation that the character is worthless anywayz and it's a bore to have them along, or harsh to have them in the team. I didn't actually stick to my seat tight enough as I had to pay the waterbills twice during the movie thanks to the Large Ice Lemon Tea. Skipping portions of movie is not a habit of mine, unless the movie is not really that good. See... I don't really fall asleep, it's not too good enough to create an awareness to others that the movie is not that good... Ahahaha... kidding kidding... =) But then again, you would have expected the ending anywayz, even from the beginning. No one would have survived the sun for that matter of fact unless you are one of those Fantastic Four Heroes, and to leave a bomb strong enough to explode, the sonic frequencies would be enough to send the ship out of orbit. Furthermore, to protect yourself from the sun, you would need a stronger and wider shield, which upon deployment (in this movie the shield and the payload bears the same structure with dual functions) would leave you defenseless. It's gonna blow no matter what; and with the awry errors going on each and every time, you would have definitely predicted the ending.Other than the typified story-line of a few heroes and smart-dudes from the earth sent for a mission where sacrifice seems more than a possibility to save mankind (hence igniting a fear within you that you should not be too smart or too clever u know, coz you will be chosen as an object of sacrifice for the lesser beings ahahaha) - coupled with a no-no failure of the mission to hype up the movie strength and ratings plus no further contingency plans -- the CGI is rather amazing which kinda makes you love the explosions that were created, and I really really was taken aback when I saw Dato' Michelle Yeoh broke down in tears. Her death was so uncalled for! Ish!! Anywayz, I would have depicted her as a hero and dominant actress as so forth she has been in all her previous movies. This is something different! In comparison to Armaggedon, let me spoil it for you, everyone DIES... for the good of the billions of people on Earth. So appreciate it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy, Mr. Boyle, you nearly put me to sleep with this one. Visually, it had its moments - loved the rich golds and oranges ... but this film was all about atmospherics - really it was an art film - until you put that stupid zombie in it.What was up with that anyway? Oh, yeah the guy from the first ship is going to survive for SEVEN YEARS all on his own, eating the plants that grow in the first ship's greenhouse - rrrright.All these terrific actors, terribly used. Why was Michelle Yeoh in this anyway? You didn't let her do anything but be window-dressing. Why was Hiroyuki Sanada in the movie? You didn't let him do anything either. I'm a hip director and I know who the cool Asian actors are so I'll put them in my movie .... yawn.As a science fiction aficionado I was sorely disappointed in Sunshine. It looked so cool from the ad campaign and theater trailers. Yet, once you were watching it you felt like you were watching a little bit of 2001, a little bit of Silent Running, a little bit of Outland, a little bit of 2010, a touch of Solaris, and then a heaping helping of Event Horizon.The only thing that could have saved the movie is if the girl who tore off a piece of the zombie's arm then ate it and said, "Mmmm, tastes like bacon!" Then I would have had a laugh and the dull pretentiousness I'd endured up to that point would have had some release.</fullReview>

Was he there the whole time, and was he the one who caused the problems that were shown at the beginning?!? Yeah, that's another thing... The relationships were undeveloped. I mean after all that time, you'd think they'd have some type of bond at the end, especially between Capa and Cassie. Yup, nothing, and I left unsatisfied..There wasn't any charm. No quirks to the characters, no motifs, no catchy phrases or subtle hints of foreshadow. I mean, I would've liked some inside jokes or something... ANYTHING.I feel like there should be a re-write... I had no idea what was going on in the end or what the "tension" was or the "stakes." I mean, when the guy encountered the psycho at the end, what were the stakes then? It was too unclear as to what he was gonna gain by killing him or lose by not..There needed to be more explanations, and for that, the film was lacking a good deal...Some of the acting left me a little cold... Well, actually because I didn't see how the characters would be justified in their decisions. The logic alert went off maybe once, even though I love going along for the ride.I guess overall, it was a good attempt at something unique. I appreciate that it isn't the cookie-cutter, run-of-the-mill sci-fi space flick, but at the same time, it has some serious flaws..I guess, basically, I am left wondering where's the heart of this movie? I know, I know, saving mankind is important and all, but there wasn't any defining moment that stood out where I thought, OK, these people are PASSIONATE about devoting there lives... I mean, some of the characters were weak and unnecessary and didn't add to the plot at all...My rating would have to be 6.3 out of 10 (boosted because I adore Cillian Murphy)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bit disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May contain spoilers !! Overview: Icarus II is the second crew sent to the sun with a payload equivalent to an energy recharger for the dying sun. Icarus I was sent on the mission for the same purpose but it disappeared under some mysterious circumstances. While on their journey Icarus II receives some distress signals near Mercury which they think seems to be coming from Icarus I. The crew decides to alter their plans and head towards the signals despite being low on oxygen. When they dock with Icarus I, some of the crew member head inside the spacecraft to search for any survivor. Things are going smooth. They are able to restart the spaceship's computer. But something happens to them and they are now in deep trouble.Was it any good?: Yeah, the plot seems to be a really thrilling one. The movie indeed has some interesting plot. The first half was really a nail biting one. But the problem lies in the second half. It's very disheartening to watch an astronaut make a very serious mistake which puts the life of the entire crew on stake. Characters are killed without any concrete reason. The main problem lies in the fact that despite having a fresh and interesting concept the film suddenly starts intersecting with the plots of some already made sci-fi thriller. If you have watched The Core then you will understand my point. The story writer was probably clueless about how to end this ordeal. He kills the concept with its ending. Danny Boyle tries very hard at making the movie seem to be new affair. But thanks to the holes in the storyline even he fails to provide a satisfactory last 35 minutes or so.Verdict: When you start feeling that you are watching the best sci-fi flick of the millennium you are hit with a stone. That's what I felt while watching the movie. The whole viewing experience was marred by the sudden disastrous end to the movie. Not bad but disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best science fiction films lately</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two ways a science fiction film can succeed - one is based on special effects that turn the scientific ideas or the fantastic worlds of imagination in screen images and the second is just to make a good film about people, human beings confounded with their own limits, feelings and challenges in some kind of future of science-fiction related environment. 'Sunshine' succeeds to combine the two in one of the best films in the genre that I have seen lately.The team of astronauts sent to save the Earth by re-igniting Sun is faced with their own weaknesses and fears, and this is the focus of director Danny Boyle. It is not that special effects are missing, quite the contrary, and I also liked the good cinematography, with the yellow-orange-red palette of the solar fires justifying the fascination for light that haunts many of the heroes. A good team of actors does a nice job, with Cillian Murphy and Michelle Yeoh being the best in my view. It is not an optimistic film, and some of the scenes lean to the horror side, but the humanity of the approach make it more interesting than many other films in its category. Future will be populated by real people as present is, and this film is more about these people and less about machines or monsters, this being the main reason for its appeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sunshine" is blindingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something to be said about beloved independent directors who go from the "best kept secrets" of the industry and into the realm of big-budget productions. In the best-case scenario, we have auteurs like Peter Jackson bringing much of their off-kilter wackiness to the mainstream; at their worst, vision is trampled underfoot by the studio system. As for Danny Boyle, I was never very impressed with his post-"Trainspotting" output; from the misguided ("A Life Less Ordinary") to the overblown (the overrated "28 Days Later"), he was clearly unafraid of taking risks, but mostly wound up with a middling product. "Sunshine," however, is the type of exceeding-expectations experience that has certainly restored my faith in Boyle's craft (not to mention the sci-fi genre itself). In the near future (the film smartly keeps the year ambiguous), the sun is on the verge of dying out, thus threatening the existence of all mankind; the crew of Icarus II (following after the unsuccessful Icarus I) is traveling through space, towing a bomb to be detonated inside the sun, and thus saving Planet Earth. An intriguing setup (and rather timely, given the success of "An Inconvenient Truth") is further emboldened by Alex Garland's cerebral script, which avoids genre clichés and stereotypical characters; Boyle's eye for visuals and human emotion renders the material with a sledgehammer impact, lending a powerful sense of reality to the proceedings (by the last 30 minutes, he has done such a good job of conveying the urgency of the situation that it feels like it's actually unraveling in real life). The performances are spot-on, and--like Boyle's direction--avoid conventional clichés.7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

Sadly, it lacked a coherent story. This movie could not decide if it wanted to be a realistic space adventure, a spiritual journey, or a horror film. Try to imagine 2001 Space Odyssey meets Solaris, meets Nightmare on Elm Street (right down to the makeup). The editing and directing seem to blame for a frequent sensation that you missed something in the telling. One minute, there characters are in one place talking about one thing, the next is a scene where clearly something important has occurred but the viewer is not given critical information. There area so many tangents in this convoluted and disjointed tale that even I, a major Sci-Fi and end-of-of-the-world genre buff could not get engaged with this shallow movie. The director was so lazy that he simply (and transparently) incorporated familiar scenes from classic movies like Alien, 2001, and others into the mix. Simply bad story telling in what SHOULD have been and COULD have been an awesome movie given the budget and talent they had. In the end they defaulted to a "stooopid" formula horror plot, with a weak attempt at making some garbled and bizarre spiritual message. Bottom line - I would not recommend this unless you have time to kill while waiting in a laundromat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mind you, I'm not a reviewer. Don't have Siskel and Ebert skills and I don't analyze things to death (like they sometimes did).Look around and you won't see me commenting on many things. I mean, I am a devoted (sp?) supporter of Firefly (the series) and Serenity (the movie). Even then, I didn't comment. (well, sales should have said it all...*grin*) So, I was expecting a "wanna-be" Bruce Willis movie ala "Armagedden" (again, spelling). But, it was quite the thinking man's (person's) movie. Why, might you ask? OK, I'll explain my theory about heroes.Say you have 100 men in a platoon told to assault a hill. They know it's their duty. So they make the assault (and I'm assuming) and each individual hopes there will not be a bullet with their name on it. (so to speak) But, as war has shown us, people die and they are pronounced heroes. To me, the bigger hero is one who knows he's (she's) going to die and proceeds anyway. That's a hero! This movie shows us what a hero is. What a human being is who isn't "hero" material. This movie raises questions about what God allows and what (people think) God doesn't allow. This movie successfully raises questions about the difficult decisions humans have to make in a truly difficult situation.While it's SciFi, it's loaded with moral questions. And, if the ending doesn't make you "water up", then you need to take a fresh look all the people who have died for causes so that others can live in a better life.This move was a pleasing surprise! Enough so to make me spend time making a comment. You should give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This One's Got It Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fellow Cinema Lovers,I 'm writing you early Sunday morning to tell you about my viewing 'Sunshine' last evening.Occasionally a movie gets to be made that has the elements of Great Drama &amp; Great Science. Bladerunner. 2001 Space Odessey. Alien. There are probably others. What did they have in common? Atmoshpere. My favorite 'The Innocents' comes to mind. All praise to Danny Boyle! He's got it right. This is first rate Human Drama. Great use of silence. This is first rate Science. SCIENCE FICTION IS BACK BABY! Add this one to your list of classic movies.Reviews from the Heart,Rolando:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hated how it suddenly...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love science fiction and I was excited to find this movie and see it had good ratings. The production values were fairly high at the beginning, I liked the spaceship and it seemed believable to me. It was tragic and beautiful and well executed like 2001: A Space Odyssey and reminded me a bit of the best parts of Silent Running, too.My partner and I both had some trouble with the idea of the sun dying so soon to our current times when there is no explanation given. Current science says the sun should be around basically as it is for another 5-6 Billion years.I was liking this movie OK until the point at which it suddenly turned into a horror movie and provided no real explanation for anything after that. Why is the evil character blurry all the time? Where does he get his super strength and evil genius when he is supposed to be completely burned up by overexposure to the sun? Also at that point the camera work became completely impossible to follow.Then there is the extreme silliness with the computer not telling anyone that there was an unexpected and unidentified person on board the ship suddenly - it was like pulling teeth to get information from the computer BEFORE it was unplugged. AND how come they couldn't rescue the other guy(s) once the airlock was damaged- there was plenty of air and seal left on the original mission's ship for the psych officer to leisurely go burn himself up with sun.I also think that naming the mission Icarus was completely silly. Icarus FAILED in the end - he died from flying too close to the sun. Naming not only the first failed mission but the 2nd one the same thing - its just unbelievably stupid as a name unless you want the mission to fail in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I hate about Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what I was going to see when I went to see this movie. I had no expectations at all, but when the terrible end titles' music went off, I realized I was profoundly angry, but in an oddly puzzled way.The main plot line for "Sunshine" is the perfect counterpart to one of my favorite sci-fi short stories: "Phoenix" by Clark Ashton Smith. The short novel, which I read for the first time at the age of 15 but still stays, has a simple but very moving, brilliant idea. Rebirth and death come together in a very poetic way, through the late realization of a goodbye. The conscious suicide of the beloved one will literally make the sun reborn, bringing back hope and life to a shivering humanity. I didn't like to spoil so much about the short novel, but I wanted to point out that this movie "Sunshine" tells basically the same story, but seen through the eyes of who leaves: the hero that "comes back in the sunlight".It's the other half of the plot, so to say, though if almost certainly by chance.And here comes the pain.I can't figure out how a monster is necessary here. I just can't. Yep, a monster. OK, there's a good but dangerous (and ultimately disastrous) theological angle that explains it all. The sun was always god through history, men's days are over, and and and. But I still don't get it.I mean, there's a very promising young talent, a soundtrack that is often a perfect match to the images, an incredible sense of wonder instilled by the grandeur of some sequences... and you put there a zombie.It could have worked? I'm not sure, but here it sure didn't.What I understand, is the compulsion and necessity to pack a sci-fi movie with action sequences. It's business. Most sci-fi people want action, you put a half-transcendent corpse in a spaceship. It flows.It's a shame that such a powerful idea in the main plot line went down the hill this way. I keep awkwardly projecting in my head that other movie, the one that this would have been without all the unnecessary and sometimes crappy add-ons. Honestly, my heart beats more when I understand the long term consequences of a malfuncion or a hazard, than when I try to decode a chaotic escape from a biblical-talking zombie prophet.Double shame, that other movie will never exist now. Hollywood and its mechanisms have obliterated that chance. What we got here, is an average movie with some points of interest and some major flaws.And I keep thinking about other stories, books especially, raped by these mechanisms. One for all, "The neverending story" by Michael Ende. Who's read the book and seen the movie, understands my sadness. I'm not saying this movie's all bad like "The neverending story" was, but it had a big potential that got wasted all the same.How sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand this movie is not for everyone, but personally I liked it. The movie doesn't have much explanation when it comes to why the sun is dying or who these people are back on Earth, but I liked that the story is based purely around what's happening on the ship without all the explanation. The fact that you only see these people in relation to the mission helps to focus the story on whats happening in the present and increases the feeling of isolation. The casting was perfect and the actors performances were flawless. Visually, it was beautiful. There were a few mistakes but I don't feel as if they were unforgivable. To be honest the first function of a movie is to be entertaining and all the little, or big, mistakes were necessary to further the storyline even if meant logic had to be put aside in some parts. When you think about it as a story it really was quite well written, especially from a psychological point of view. The only things I would change would be (1) the ships design, I'm glad they started the movie out in space because there is no way they could portray that thing getting off the ground and (2) the stowaway (I can't remember his name) in the condition he was in he would have been long dead, I think they should have made his appearance a little less extreme. All in all for me quite an enjoyable film, but if you like action packed SciFi, you can't overlook mistakes or you need background information I don't recommend you watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was beautiful. No spoilers here. No professional review from me just my opinion. This was certainly the best science fiction movie, for me anyway, since Solaris (2002). It has most of the feeling I was left with from Solaris '02 as well as the class and intelligence of that film. Solaris '02 and a heavy handed touch of Event Horizon terror. Spectacular special effects and solid story and acting. No actor really stands out here, which was good, and I believe it would have harmed the intended message/feel of the movie. My tilt would be a 9 ..but this movie deserves a boost from the overly critical. This film is very moving if you're open to it. A not so overly flattering 10. Creative thinkers will enjoy this film and the science fact retentive would enjoy it if they could lend themselves a little more to the FICTION aspect. If this was boring to you then you probably are a silly and frustrating individual to be around. A very enjoyable movie for people like you and I.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank God for Danny Boyle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I have only seen two of Boyle films, (trainspotting and 28 Days later) they were two films that were great and different enough to get me to go see Sunshine. Now, if you have seen Trainspotting or 28 Days later, you know that Boyle as a tendency to take a subject film like drugs or zombies and turn it on its head and make it better than expected. I am not a zombie fan. I really don't like zombie movies at all but I loved 28 Days later. So if you are with me so far, you might agree with what I've to say about Sunshine.First off, the topic of the movie is more gargantuan than any other end of the world type movie that I can think of. We've avoided comets and burrowed to the center of the earth but traveling to the sun to jump start a star is a massive concept but its presented to the audience in a way that is believable. Understanding that every audience has to give up a little to faith in any sci-fi movie; the leaps of faith Boyle asks his audience to make in sunshine are not unreasonable. Boyle takes a subject of deep space travel as witnessed in other movies like the space odyssey and does his best to add enough suspense to keep you on your seat, blends in a fair amount of realism, and also adds a touch of humanity to make Sunshine the BEST science fiction film easily to come out since Kubrick's tale of a star child. The only other film to give Sunshine a run for its money would be Children of Men, but again, those are two different films. Here is the catch though. I loved the film. But there is an element to the end of the film that most people didn't like. My brother, father, and friend all agreed that the ending twist seemed more unnecessary than anything else. All three of them cited that the twist didn't ruin the movie for them but rather added an element the movie could have done without. I found the twist to be just perfect. 2/3 of the film is driven by external conflict in the environment and internal conflict in the characters and the last 1/3 of the film is driven by an entirely different force. I found the twist to be creepy, intriguing, and absolutely perfect when compared to the previous pace of the film. All the characters portray real people faced with the burden of the survival of the human race. This movie paints a wonderful portrait of human survival and the limitations humans are restricted by in their own capacity. Again, this isn't Armegedon or The Core. This is a generic genre turned on its head and done beautifully. For a mental masterpiece, go see Sunshine!For visual masturbation go see something like Transformers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful movie, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...a lousy third-act. I mean, I was totally into the movie up until that point. I mean the production value was beautiful. It was mesmerizing to see the fiery sun fill the screen. I was in awe just as the crew of the Icarus II was as they watched Mercury slide across the immense star. I got a sense of loneliness as I watched the cumbersome and state-of-the-art Icarus II twist and tumble as it traversed the cold void towards its hellish target. And the way the members of the crew were dispatched? Incinerated and frozen? It made me shiver. I felt as if we were on a real mission to the sun and these were real people fighting for Earth's and their own survival by jumping over the hurdles that a mission of this type would naturally and realistically throw at them.As I watched, I felt that this was an original film. It wasn't derivative. It wasn't an Alien clone. It wasn't a Event Horizon copy. It didn't remind me of any of that. I felt that I was looking at something unique. It made me want to go into the lobby and buy the DVD on my way out.I totally dug it.All of that changed when Pinbaker, the captain of the ill-fated Icarus I, showed up.I was bemused when the film quickly turned into a run of the mill, garden variety, Alien and Event Horizon wannabe. (More of the latter, really. Pinbaker was essentially Dr. Weir from that film. They almost looked identical.) I'm thinking, where did this come from? I mean was this charred and disfigured man who seemed to come from the fiery bowels of hell itself needed? I didn't buy the fact that Pinbaker, who sustained those types of severe injuries, could get on board and terrorize the crew of the Icaraus II, let alone survive. The problem is, is that a villain wasn't needed for this type of film. It seemed way out of place. Out of left field, maybe? The only "villain" that was needed and was already THERE was nature itself. I would have much rather seen the film's true antagonists--nature and technology-- throw a few more mistakes, miscalculations and just plain bad luck at the crew. The film's denouement would have been more meaningful. It would in turn make the movie on the whole more original, more fun and more enjoyable.It just seemed that Danny Boyle (Director) and Alex Garland (Writer) had a great ending when they were writing the script and then the studio stepped in and told them to change it. "We need the safe ending. We need a ending that those droves of unintelligent movie-goers will comprehend," the studio execs would bellow. And at a budget of fifty million dollars, I'm sure the only thought on the money men's minds was their return on their investment. (Then again, who knows? I wasn't there during the convoluted production process. I just have a hard time believing that the third-act that was on the screen was the one Boyle and Garland truly intended.) All involved just tried to push and shove and force the movie into some type of safe, low-risk, cookie-cutter template. And I thought that was such a stupid move because they had such a masterpiece on their hands.It seemed like this: Danny Boyle started out making an original, thought-provoking and engaging NASA-like documentary and ended up with the uninspired fourth sequel in the 28 Days Later saga.Still, this film did entertain me.It's just that the movie's turn into all-too familiar territory makes you wonder what the filmmakers were thinking.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was good, but when watching it, forget about science</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's now 50 years into the future and our sun has been infected with a Q-Ball, which will cause the sun to die unless it's reignited, and that's why Earth sent a team of astronauts to reignite the sun.SUNSHINE is filled with fantastic special effects, that do manage to take your breathe away and with Danny Boyle's direction each second is always suspenseful and cannot make your eyes move away from the screen. However, this film does have its major flaws since nothing like some of the things portrayed in the film can happen in real life due to science (eg. none of the characters disintegrate when they're near the sun, even though the sun doesn't have enough energy to support life on Earth).But overall, it's worth a watch, but just forget about science whilst watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but worthy,visually spectacular effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sci fi genre has only fitfully appeared in mainstream cinema recently. As a fan, I wanted the film to succeed. Boyle and Garland are distinguished and accomplished at directing and producing, and equipped with a big budget, this picture stood every chance of success. But somehow it doesn't quite get there.The CGI effects are tremendous. The soundtrack compelling, broody and sympathetic.The subject matter is Shakespearean in ambition - destiny, fate,tragedy, the Grand Quest. But the script doesn't match this ambition and the storyline looks as though it has been machine-gunned in the editing suite.A third of the way through the film we discover that the first mission spaceship is still around. The crew have to make a momentous and plot altering decision to investigate. the dramatic potential is huge but after the decision is taken we suddenly appear at "Icarus1" the original spaceship.Ultimately i lost interest as the bold and challenging aspirations of the original story are shredded by cheap dramatic devices and unconvincing plot and character development. as a consequence it fails against the less ambitious "Event Horizon", and never matches "Alien " in the suspense stakes- both films clearly providing a stylistic anchor.A decent effort - but could, and should, have been far better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>needlessly flawed lesson about religion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been many reviews written so I don't think I have anything special to add. However, let me say that the movie is psychologically very complex and therefore on a high level as well as visually astonishing BUT I can't shake the feeling that the "new crew member" turned the movie from one type of sci-fi movie to quite another. Lacking in explaining how he got onto the other vessel and how he'd survived (yet again) being exposed to direct sunlight by Capa. I also don't think anyone (especially a physicist) would come near a weird-looking creature WITHOUT at least ADJUSTING THE LIGHT so he could see it before coming right next to it (him). It was just dumb and completely out of context of the movie. Of course, I enjoyed the lesson that religion blinds people into doing horrific things thinking they're doing god's will. Obviously that just isn't the case (if you are a believer or not), at least not in many cases. He claims he's been talking to god for 7 years and he's clearly misunderstood him because in the end things turn out differently from what god supposedly instructed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Sunshine is a great sci-fi movie experience (particularly on the big screen), it reminded me just a little too often of certain OTHER great sci-fi movie experiences ? in particular 2001, Alien and Dark Star. Sunshine's premise is unique (far-fetched, but on the watchable side of ridiculous), but there were certain technical and stylistic elements that reminded me a bit too much of these other films. In this time of postmodernist or post-post-postmodernist 'homage', perhaps that is what I was witnessing: intentional references to genre classics. But I'd gone in hoping for more.It wasn't as good as 28 Days Later ? that other Boyle/Garland/Macdonald/Murphy collaboration ? either. That won me over because it succeeded in setting itself apart from other examples of its genre. This is something Sunshine obviously did not achieve.However, like I said, it is still a very good film, primarily due to the fantastic visuals. Danny Boyle's visual sense is extraordinary, and creates the perfect atmosphere for the drama to play out in. The philosophy behind Alex Garland's script is also interesting (uncomplicated, but providing some food for thought), even if it gets a little lost among the pretty pictures.While the characters are barely-fleshed-out stereotypes (all you want in a movie like this - it's not really ABOUT the characters, after all), they are given life by a very good group of actors. In fact, the main reason I had looked so forward to Sunshine was the cast. I had never seen such a small cast that included so many actors I was already a fan of. I was like...'Oh, so Rose Byrne's in this. Hey, Cliff Curtis, too. Cool. Wait! AND Michelle Yeoh? AND Cillian Murphy? AND Chris Evans?! THIS IS GONNA BE SOOOO GREAT!!'...or something like that.Anyway, they didn't disappoint me. Although I have to admit, I did have some reservations about Chris Evans. I like him, but the other things I've seen him in (Fantastic 4, Cellular, etc.) were a lot lighter in tone than this, and I wasn't sure if he was up to SERIOUS acting. But he did a great job. They all did.My one little gripe about the cast (or maybe the characters - I'm not sure) is that for such an international group of actors, the Icarus II crew was disappointingly...well...American, I guess. Not that I have anything against Americans, it's just that this is a trip to save the WORLD, and, while there were several Asian countries represented, five of the eight crew were American ? and, ironically, three of those five were played by non-American actors. I assume they made Cillian, Rose and Cliff use American accents in order to appease US audiences, but would they really be THAT bothered by having an Irishman, an Aussie and a Kiwi on the spaceship? (hey, I think there's a joke in that...) I mean, there are still two perfectly good Yanks there (well, maybe one) to take care o' business. All I'm asking for is a bit of DIVERSITY!!But, as I said, it's only a LITTLE gripe.Anyway, while Sunshine falls disappointingly short of 'classic' status, it's still a great watch for the visuals alone (a bit of space...a close-up sun...Rose Byrne...). But try and catch it on the big screen if you can. I mean, it'll play on DVD or whatever, but it looks SO great on the giant cinema screen that you really shouldn't miss it.Just don't forget your shades. ;-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a bit hit and miss. A sci fi/horror which takes the tried and tested formula from other space films . but given a bit of razz-a-ma-taz for the 2007 audience. As usual with Boyles films , the characters are brilliant , you are more interested in them than the story which is unfolding around them. The acting is also of a pretty good standard in this movie , with stand out performances by the bloke from fantastic four and the Irish dude from 28 days later. Atmosphere is steadily built up in this film and the feeling of claustrophobia is conveyed well.The visuals are also really good. But despite this , i left the cinema feeling slightly unfulfilled. Were this film falls down , ( as many other reviews have pointed out) is that the "big reveal" as to the problem the crew have encountered feels slightly anti climatic. Tension has been wrenched up to such a degree that you are almost inevitably left thinking "is that it?".Despite this , this movie is pretty enjoyable and i would recommend it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunshine is a rubbish film in every way. I binned it as soon as I had finished it What a waste of time. It was derivative, but failed to derive anything of worth. The sound-track was poor and intrusive musically, largely indecipherable verbally and often absurd noise-wise. Having personally met some of the great NASA astronauts during the years of Apollo I can say few of the male crew on Icarus would have passed a selection test for any serious mission. The women were more realistic. We seem to be moving progressively into an era of films made by people whose experience of life is itself drawn from the media, both in terms of a journalistic interpretation of reality and the fiction of movies from cartoons to CGI masquerading as a possible, if fictional reality.

		<shortDescription>Sunshine Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Boyle's latest foray into full-blown science fiction, Sunshine, lingers in the realm of horror at the most inappropriate times, and stifles the excitement at equally inopportune moments. Undoubtedly suspenseful, but with frenetic editing oftentimes replacing important scenes that shouldn't be so abstract, Sunshine may find itself fading all too quickly amongst the dregs of the genre. Amazing special effects and stunning visuals propel it to the top of the list of potential blockbusters, but mainstream audiences may be discouraged too quickly by the confused blend of themes and the uncertain motives behind Boyle's storyline decisions.In the future, the earth has been thrown into a nuclear winter from the sun's rapidly dying state. A group of scientists and astronauts aboard the Icarus Two are on a last ditch attempt to re-ignite the sun with a massive bomb - a mission that was failed by the previous team seven years earlier. When a distress signal from the Icarus One is picked up and the decision is made to intercept and investigate, tensions rise from critical calculation errors and dissension among the ranks. After a mysterious accident hinders the mission's progress and forces the crew to re-evaluate their situation, things take a turn for the worse as it appears someone or something doesn't want the operation to succeed.The beginning of Sunshine introduces unique and interesting characters, and their immediate development ensures that these will not be the static and forgettable lot from Michael Bay's Armageddon, which features a similarly unlikely plot and stereotypical heroes. But in the distant future, the crew of the Icarus is faced with the bleakness of unforgiving and lonely solitude from mankind, which has bestowed on these heroes the mission to save the world. A few early shots which weave through shadowy corridors and dance about dimly lit Giger-esquire passageways immediately foreshadow ominous events. But the alarming intensity Boyle borrows from Ridley Scott's Alien is soon to be abandoned, as an overwhelming theme of self-sacrifice quickly permeates the ill-fated vessel. It keeps up quite adequately initially, with the crew continually faced with problems that insist upon sacrificing lives or weighing detrimental options. It is here that the character development and acting really grips the audience, with crew members greedily valuing their own lives above the betterment of humanity, or boldly volunteering for horribly suicidal missions. Chris Evans' Mace is perhaps the most influential and remarkable character of the crew, due to his unflinching dedication to the mission, which often leads to the realization that they are the last resort, last hope and final attempt at saving Earth. Cassie (Rose Byrne) displays the most relatable human qualities, refusing to give in to the idea that any one soul is less important than the entirety of humanity. Cillian Murphy's Capa is clearly the lead, but despite his powerful performance, oftentimes steps aside for the supporting casts' notable moments.Midway through the film, Boyle peaks with white-knuckle suspense and tear-jerker moments as his hapless crew is bombarded with issues of rapidly depleting oxygen, destruction to necessary ship components, and prioritizing the crew in the event that only a "lucky" few may see the mission through to its completion. When the decision is made to board Icarus One, the original ship sent some decade earlier, which was a supposed total failure, the eerie horror elements begin to take shape. Not a primitive form of scare tactics, but an inventive splicing of subliminal images, the editing warns of lingering atrocities that may still lurk in the lightless regions of the desolate craft. The creepiness remains, but is sadly underdeveloped, and gives way to obvious horror techniques that feel remarkably stereotypical. The sacrifices of the crew, the fear of death and the fear of failure all take a back seat to an outlandish nemesis that washes away the initial impressiveness of the already far-fetched premise.As unbelievable as Boyle's plot appears, we are so perfectly soaked in its plausibility, from the characters, their emotions, and the situations that befall them. But like many of the quickly forgotten stabs at the vast science fiction genre, Sunshine introduces elements of shock that jarringly awake us from our comfortable suspension of disbelief and remove us from our sympathies for the protagonists. It becomes a game of who stays alive until the conclusion, instead of whether or not the mission succeeds. And the conclusion, possibly adding to the throwbacks to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey with abstract images, corybantic editing and the computer that controls the well-being of the ship (with an appealing woman's voice), is too bizarre and unclear, leading to general dissatisfaction.Sunshine had plenty of potential, namely because the things that should have happened most certainly could have (although Boyle chose other routes), and is a welcome addition to 2007's lack of serious and mature science fiction. Ultimately, however, Boyle's latest film never really knows what it wants to be. The acting truly shines and brilliantly realized characters help to counteract the spiraling storyline. Such involving personas keep the suspense high and the ennui low, but even state-of-the-art special effects and inventive editing can't quite keep the light burning bright enough when the film flickers into the heavily treaded horror genre and the realm of disbelief. Questionable denouement direction aside, Sunshine still remains an engaging sci-fi thriller with plenty of hard-hitting action and scares, but like looking directly into the sun for too long, the lasting impression that it leaves might just blur amongst the rest of the genre's misadventures.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well well...I have to say this was the weirdest movie I've seen along time...That doesn't mean that this was a bad one, because it wasn't. The effects were great and the actors and the actresses were chosen well as they played their role as believable way as it could..but the main thing that made me give this movie only those 5 stars is that even I watched this movie trough from the first captures of the film till the end credits I didn't get the idea, the point of this film...I tried to, but I certainly didn't find it out. Okey, so I knew that this is about some station in the outer space and that the sun runs an important role...In my point of view the reason why they were there and what was their "mission" didn't reflect well enough to the watchers (in this case - mine), because I had to come here to make sure and find out what was initially the idea.. I also think that movie should tell clearly enough the storyline, without putting anybody to do some background info searching, to stay in the same level with the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing the good score here on IMDb, I decided to watch the movie. The story starts interesting with a lot of big questions and dilemmas raised. It got my interest and I really got into the story. But at about 2/3 third of the movie, there is an entirely (unlogical) twist in the story which chances the movie from drama to cheap horror/thriller. I starts very good and catches your focus, but they just put some weird ending in it. I felt really ripped of and disappointed that the questions and plot raised in the beginning, don't get a follow up. Furtermore they almost copy/paste the last part of the script from other movies, like Event Horizon and Sphere.Visually really good though. We all have that feeling sometimes that you've seen a movie and after it you felt ripped of. This is one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not too often that I find myself at odds with the mainstream media reviews but this is one rare example. I was looking forward to the movie ? it had received good press reviews (in the UK at least), I'd seen Boyles other films and found then interesting at the very least. I quite like a good Sci-Fi yarn and so off I went, looking forward to an enjoyable Friday evening. The (largely unknown, to me at least) cast were OK, pretty decent actors. The story was OK, nothing terribly original ('off we go in our spaceship to save the planet!') but on it went?and on?.and on. I found the story very thin and the 'fireworks display' visuals rather tedious and ultimately irritating. I found myself bored, very unusual as I love movies, even those not too good. I also had some difficulty in following exactly what was happening, which actually wasn't too much for most of the time. Maybe I was just not in the mood but I really couldn't see what this film did to deserve the good reviews. Actually, it wasn't just me as my partner, a real film buff and lover of Sci - Fi, was at least as disappointed as me. Also, did anyone else notice the similarity (in some respects at least) to 'Event Horizon'? The latter, while not a masterpiece is a much better and more enjoyable film in my view ? worth checking out if you've not seen it. Sunshine? I think it will be very quickly forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science fiction with an unfortunate twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen all of Danny Boyle's movies, but his productions tend to lose quality in my opinion ... From excellent "Trainspotting" and "Shallow Grave", we skip to mediocre "The Beach" and "28 days later" ...I was ready to give him another try with "Sunshine", even more curious to see how he would do with a SciFi theme.The result: The story setup is plausible (by SciFi movies standards that is), and the atmosphere is vaguely reminiscent of classic space movies, which is not bad. Some inevitable plot holes appear here and there, but SciFi addicts have that capacity of forgiveness, as long as the story is compelling. That would be fine, if the story didn't suddenly take a wild genre turn near the last third of the movie, ruining any previously exposed situations and relationships. And the worse is that the last part looked to me as an experimentation on this other genre, where the spaceship is not really used, and the characters lose any little reality they had gathered so far.The characters, eight astronaut scientists, do a convincing job at first, but there are more than one occasion where I wasn't really persuaded of their mission and knowledge (and neither were they). Maybe I wasn't paying enough attention that night, but at times, I wasn't sure of who was doing what on the ship ... The relationships between them only explore the emotional ground. It is a valid approach, with such a claustrophobic and long journey, but a little social and hierarchical information would have fleshed them out a little more, especially during the crucial decision situations, to which they are supposed to be best at !The special effects are nice. The sun's lethal breathe is well rendered I think, and the ship is nicely designed. I only regret how the CGI tends to look the same after four external flybys ... I didn't get to understand where the living quarters were, for example ... which is not so important, but would have given the ship an identity.Overall, I enjoyed the start, and was confused and disappointed by the end. As many pointed out here, there are great ideas/ingredients in this movie ... the problem is they used the wrong recipe to assemble them ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The positive reviews of the movie that I have seen here are quite accurate. Just wanted to throw my two cents in. This movie was AMAZING. A bit slow to start but it was necessary to build the plot. This is not just a Sci-Fi story. It has multiple levels delving into human nature. It explores our darkest and brightest traits as humans. Spirituality and befuddled beliefs shed light on our own very existence here on earth in our day to day lives. A very powerful movie in the way it compels you to see all characteristics in each one of us. My wife hates Sci-Fi movies and absolutely LOVED this as well. The acting is very good and the plot is fantastic. Each character combines to create a whole atmosphere that is very thought provoking as a whole.The analogy that I saw previously of 2001: Space Odyssey meets Event Horizon is a very good one. Anyone who loves 2001 should view this film without hesitation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I proudly caught the trailer to this movie a few months ago, and when it finally came out to theaters, or shall I say theater (no "s"), it was almost impossible to catch it. The only theater in all of Toronto and the GTA which played this movie was some horrid, 70" &lt;- (yes inches, NOT foot) screen. Why no half-decent theater wanted to carry this movie was beyond me. After the first hour of this film, I was thinking that Sunshine was easily the most underrated movie of the year. It seemed like they fired the director and hired a child who could not express himself for the directing job about 30 minutes towards the ending of the movie.Sunshine starts in the future with a second group of astronauts trying to save the earth by "recharging" the dying sun. They detoured to the outskirts of Mercury to recover and save the first group of astronauts, only discovering bodies and a motionless spacecraft. On the way back to revive the sun, they discovered that not only has the detour jeopardized their mission, but an extra piece of mass has mysteriously been detected on their ship.This movie thrills and entertains like it promises, but the end just doesn't meet up to par. It is very scattered and leaved you wondering what the hell happened. The special affects is outstanding and the cinematography is brilliant.I did not believe this movie for a second either. For a start, the sun would not just fade away and need charging to revive it. Overtime once the sun gets old enough, it will exploded. Not fade away like a light-bulb. Second, when you look straight into the sun for a period of time on Earth, you screw up your retina and your eyes start burning. But of course when they are right next to the sun, they could look straight at it without any trouble. And if that isn't enough, they could float in space without a astronaut suit and having their heads not blow up. Sure this movie is all science fiction but they could have at least made it slightly believable.This movie could have officially been declared underrated if not for the confusing, what he hell happened ending. I would have to give it a 5/10 because after trying so hard to find and see this movie, I was let down with the ending.</fullReview>

The book we read in class and I liked it a lot, little hard to understand but the movie was a disspointment. As for "Sunshine" the book gave me thrills and excitement through each chapter. As for the movie which I liked very much thanks to the great cast and crew member. Sanada Hiroyuki, Michelle Yeoh, Chris Evans, but I think Cillian Murphy who played Capa at his best performance ever. I give it a 10 out of 10. For those who didn't like it, im in shock.

		<shortDescription>This was good. Best SF film in at least six years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think brevity is best to do this movie justice. First, the movie is good. It is worth the exorbitant price of a ticket. Second, it is Danny Boyle's best work. Not necessarily his opus, I think that is yet to come. But having seen the majority of what was released in the US, I think I speak with a certain degree of authority when I say, I like it.Now, there are still some points that need to be forgotten if you are anal like me and need to get through this film with as little pain as possible. The first point is that you need to forget that should such a mission as was the subject of this film be necessary, it could be accomplished by remote; no crew needed. Second, you need to forget that computers are best used to double check the work of humans for errors. And lastly, any animal, even humans, will require 1/3 the oxygen of a normal member of their species if they stop talking, stop moving around, and restrict their diet to absolutely bare necessity.Get over those points and you are in for a great ride. I was stumped several times as to the route they were taking. Normally I have the movie figured out by the end of the first act, (This is not to boost my ego but is a jab at the poor storytelling of most movies). This one did a good job of keeping me in the dark while simultaneously keeping me entertained. The cinematography was good. I say good, because it was obvious that the majority of the shots were edited in the computer. But not to discount that, they were still amazing. The bottom line is that despite my issues with the film, the tension was good, it made sense (mostly), the science was correct (mostly) and the characters were real. No deus ex machina. Enjoy.</fullReview>

Either it gets almost full vote or really poor.And what is that all about? how come not everyone think its a mediocre movie? I think its like this: To like this movie u really have to be open to it and Se the message the creator wants to give, and its not about space adventuring , it's to give an outside the hero community space struggle to live flick with lots of feelings.Make sure to be in the right mood, or just love space, I'm a deep fan of space, and the scenes displaying the sun and stuff in this movie is sooooooooo satisfying!!Now we where a gang that watched it, and 2/5 hated it ! the rest of us loved it, and when we then after-talked about the movie, those who didn't like it talked about crazy scenes i couldn't almost remember, while the part that did like , we really knew what about the movie that was so great, i don't care if its not 100% physics accurate no movie is.and there is no need of attacking the actors, if Boyle wanted Oscars he would have picked actors from the "super-screenplay-men" The actors in this movie is so natural i feel more about them then in any Armageddon/deep impact mainstream movie,!!!!WARNING SPOILER!!! i like especially when he didn't alter the shields for the new angel to the sun, the emotion he displayed there was very deep and touching, almost nerve-tickling! sorry for my bad English!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent psychological portrayal of the effects of space travel on the human being</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been anticipating this movie for a while but it just barely met my expectations. I liked the story, characters and imagery a great deal but it did kind of fall short near the ending.The first two thirds of the film was excellent, script-wise and visually. The psychological portraits of space travel for the crew is examined nicely and the bright sun effects just add to the experience. I liked this film for sort of being in the science 'non'-fiction genre. The story is very believable and one could see it's implementation in the not too distant future...However, the final third of the film fell to disappoint. It sort of turned into a run of the mill, Hollywood slasher film. The zealous, God fearing captain of the ship that was lost on the initial and incomplete mission to reignite the sun, manages to get onto the second ship, without explanation, and just starts to terrorize the only surviving crew. At first I thought he was just in the crews' minds as per their deprivation of oxygen, but when I realized that was not so, I was quite disappointed.I would have been more satisfied if the film played more on the psychological aspects of the crew without oxygen and the captain of the first ship only playing a role in their hallucinations.The very last scene depicts a frozen over Australia as the sun brightens up over it. I really feel this scene was a lot more enjoyable because they didn't give us any Earth scenes throughout the course of the film. It leaves us asking a lot of questions, but I really think it somewhat redeems the film of the twenty minutes prior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First (And probably foremost), this movie is (and should be considered) as a borderline horror movie. Why borderline ? Because there is some sense of terror even without gruesome visualizations. Second, during the 3rd part of the movie there are pictures of contorted faces that are "embedded" on the film. It kinda start strange, as you are not sure, then it spooks a little then it just annoys (As many other things in this movie).All in all, I really don't know what to make of this one. There are some stunning visuals, and the ambient sounds are nice. The prospect is "too much" of "Event Horizon" to my liking, plus my wife got totally bummed/bored with it half way through (Not a good thing when you are in the cinema). Some other people left in the middle (We were in the 3rd day of screening and maybe 20% of the mid-sized theater was inhabited), which is never a good indication.All in all, a nice idea which is left way under developed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant piece of clever, adult sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a period of spineless, PG-13 horror movies, Danny Boyle's gritty zombie flick 28 Days Later... stood out as a genre film that was more interested in plot and characters than gore and chase sequences. The same can be said of Sunshine, Boyle's first sci-fi movie, which favors dialogue, or even silence, over loud explosions or action scenes.Or at least that's true for two-thirds of the film. It is the part in which the director (and 28 Days Later... writer Alex Garland) focus on the eight protagonists and their conflicting relationships, as they're reaching their final destination: the sun. You see, the biggest star of the universe is dying, causing our planet to become increasingly colder, and unless something is done to reignite it, no one will survive. Which is why, as we're informed by the spaceship's physicist, Robert Capa (Cillian Murphy), Icarus II is transporting a nuclear device the size of Manhattan. Of course, the fact that there won't be a second chance in case the mission fails is far from encouraging. In addition, there is no knowledge whatsoever regarding the fate of Icarus I, which left Earth seven years before and disappeared without a trace. There is no certainty of what could happen, our "heroes" being all alone in space. Or maybe they aren't...From the beginning it is clear Boyle's primary interest is the story's human core, and therefore he spends an hour or so developing the characters as naturally as possible, focusing on a cast of relatively unknown actors (with the exception of Murphy, Michelle Yeoh and Fantastic Four star Chris Evans) rather than the visual effects, although when he does use CGI the images are strikingly beautiful (especially in the tear-inducing climax). For most of its duration, Sunshine is a composed, elegant, mesmerizing piece of good film-making, reminiscent of classics like Solaris (the original, not the remake) and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Also deserving praise is Garland, who ditches all kinds of weird, frustrating explanations concerning the nuclear device by having his characters say the solution is entirely theoretical and not worth scratching one's head over.It is probably the pure beauty and calm of the introduction and mid-section that make the blood-soaked, high-speed third act seem a little out of place, the introduction of a (predictable) twist and its consequences being too contrived to really fit into the rest of the picture. In fact, it's almost as if the filmmakers had moved from one film to another, before restoring the balance in the last five minutes, probably the most touching material the Trainspotting director has ever shot.Overall, despite the dodgy final section, Sunshine is one of the most satisfying, intelligent and inspired science-fiction films in years, as Boyle successfully proves the genre does not belong exclusively to the Americans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting a huge big budget movie, but I had not seen the trailer before seeing the movie. Maybe it would have been a good idea if I had. So, they are on a spaceship and for some reason the sun has decided to go out, I don't remember why it was but oh well, throughout the movie the characters die off by either being burnt alive or stabbed by a scary (blurred out and by the way they blur the monster out the whole time he is on the screen) horrible thing that apparently spent a couple of years with God or something. The CGI is great and the sound is brilliant, this year the movie with the best sound has to be this one. The surround mix is scary and works well with giving you a solid experience in space. The story maybe a bit disappointing, good idea though wanting to re-ignite the sun but with the some strange parts to it, suddenly you find yourself in Event Horizon, although it the idea behind it is very Armaggedon style. For those of you horror lovers and people who like non-scientific science fiction this will work well. Even without the huge budget of Amaggedon, it has earned it's self some respect with sound and CGI effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One must not judge this movie by the sci-fi trope that it hangs on. If we were to judge sci-fi by truth where would Star wars 'the force' or star treks 'beam me up Scottie' come in on a scale of 1 - 10 in real life physics?. This movie must be judged on a simpler scale, the drama of the small scale enclosed and emotional life surviving against the greater scheme of heroes living and breathing a grand dream of saviours of the Earth. Where was the last movie you saw where all the participants die?. This is not Hollywood this is, again, a fusion of blockbuster and European cinema. Where Danny Boyle has triumphed once more is providing a slow burning, in depth emotional drama set in a brilliantly shot and plausibly thought out sci-fi drama that only defies physics on the grander scale of things. The characters come straight out of a youth orientated and severe hero school, mindless and driven, but each with there character driven flaw set out for the overall drama to unfold. This movie will linger in my mind just as most of Dannly Boyles work has done before, from Shallow Grave to 28 days. Please for god sake continue to throw money at this director as his projects are always sheer gold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The crisis of humanity and it's time on earth is hotly debated of the fallibility of our existence. It's this immediacy, that screen writer Alex Garland has grasped tightly, that Sunshine relishes in. In the briefest of set ups, ship Icarus II, with eight astronauts in specialist fields, carries a bomb the size of Manhattan to re-ignite the dying sun. An after thought to Sunshine, science fiction has probably reached its creative limit. The closer Icarus II flies towards its destination, Icarus I is found as a silent satellite around the sun, and the urge to uncover the failings of the first mission, becomes all to great to ignore. Without any oracle foresight, everything goes horribly wrong, as machine and human are pushed past their limits. Only as an after thought too this creative limit, with pin point accuracy to execution, Sunshine rises to the most exhilarating experiences in the science fiction genre for many a year.Director Danny Boyle has knowingly alluded towards his mentor Ridley Scott and his masterpiece sci-fi, horror film Alien. Yet no monster is hiding in the shadows terrorising the crew, but a constant unknown presence and the god like icon of the sun, constantly reminding the crew of their task to succeed. Sunshine molds influences of many sci-fi films, Alien the fore most, with the operatic levels of Kubricks 2001: A Space Odeyses, while blending actual science and theoretical science to create a reality in a believable realm.Sunshine poses many questions; the future of man kind, stability of the human mind, the fragility of machine, religion and faith, are some Sunshine tackle, yet don't think for one second there'll be time to mull these over, as from the opening moment, Boyle never lets you breath, jumping from crisis to crisis, as machine breaks down, people losing their minds and their lives. Fist clenching from the start, Sunshine only tightens it's grip, ever morphing from action to horror, at gut wrenching intensity. Visually, Sunshine is a buffet to feast upon. Stunning special effects for the ship Icarus II, and engulfing effects for the sun. Auditorily, Sunshine is ground shaking, with spine chilling sound effects and music score.Certainly not an A list cast, performances from all actors are top of their game. Rose Byrne, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Hiroyuki Sanada, Troy Garity and Cliff Curtis are all splendid in their roles, even when character development is minimal they all deliver a complete character. Cillian Murphy brings an urgency to Capa's quite and passive persona. Surprisingly, cutting to the front of the entire cast is Chris Evans, in his most mature role of his career, showing he can draw out a dramatic role and not the constant over grown child he usually acts.Nail biting and haunting from start to finish, Sunshine is an experience of sci-fi brilliance, burning into your memory, on one of the most breath-taking and heart stopping finales.</fullReview>

Not to give the whole thing away, but SUNSHINE starts out stupid and never gets better.There is no development of character at all, not much story, absolutely nothing to motivate a viewer to care about any of it.What we get instead is an excess of computer generated nonsense, along with the agonizing familiar tricks of intense music (to let us know Something Important is going on) and choppy hand-held camera stuff (to deny the viewer any way of telling what -- if anything -- is happening.)There is absolutely no suspense. None! 20th Century-Fox was making science fiction 100-times superior 50 or 60 years ago, and certainly during the Star Wars era of the 1980's. Sad how low Fox (and Hollywood) has sunk in 2007.I could recommend this mess to idiots; but I think a self respecting idiot would get bored quickly. Better perhaps than No Country for Old Men, Sunshine just sucks. Shame on anyone who scored this a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in with high expectations, from all of the raving reviews and comments, but was bitterly disappointed! I just don't get what's so great... for me it was well into the realms of average. The plot had great promise, it could have been so much better. I carried on watching hoping it would improve, but if anything it was totally random in places, and the ending was poor, this is coming from a fan of the genre by the way. Don't waste your hard earned money, wait and watch it on DVD.Just my tuppence worth.Regards,Adam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Earth sends a crew a idiots to reignite the sun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is one character in this movie that does not behave completely idiotic: the spaceships computer. From the beginning till the end the entire crew acts like a bunch of fraternity boys out bowling. Time after time they do something stupid and every time they are only saved because the on-board computer knows what to do. This could have made a great comedy. But it's not a comedy and it's not funny, it's just sad. Throughout most of the movie I couldn't help but think: If they had sent the ship unmanned and let the ships computer handle the operation there would have been no problems at all. But of cause there are problems..this is not science-fiction, just fiction. Very little in this movie is based on realism, just free fantasy. Unfortunately not very interesting fantasy. So don't watch it if that's important to you. The characters are very boring and single-minded and there is no character development. You just don't care what happens to them.Now for the good part, there are about 5 minutes towards thats not entirely predictable. Unfortunately it goes nowhere.Thats it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, finally some new Sci-Fi movie! Was looking forward to watching it.In start, all seemed good. Awesome visuals, even the start of story wasn't too bad. But than things start going wrong, very wrong. First of all, as an person with average IQ I felt quite dumbed by movie. Yes, the gravity thing, but also tons of other logical nonsenses throughout the movie, which frankly made it hard to watch for me. Airlock bursts... why do they have to keep at such distance to 'launch' over other people, instead of closing in? Antenna going to get fried? Why not stop it in shade? If not, disconnect electricity? Etc, etc.... and this is just in 2nd part of movie, whilst 3rd one is even worse. I will not even try to comment about the '5th crew member' stuff, how he survived, etc, etc ... And 'cherry on top' is ending.In the end, movie turns out to be just an eye-candy to watch, whilst trying to be all - Sci-Fi, Thriller, Horror. It could have been really good movie, but so much of potential was wasted. My rating of 3 would have been 1, if it weren't for visuals which saved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll keep it short and sweet. This is a genre-bending film with some of the most amazing visuals and cut-throat photography I have ever seen. Each shot is twisted with emotion and tension. The acting is superb given the confines of the script, in that there is not much time for characters to develop, however, each actor plays his or her role well and there is a good balance of ethos, pathos and what have you as each travesty, emergency, conflict and mortal situation unfolds. It challenges your ideas of morality and mortality.I've seen a lot of over-simplification of the last third of the film on here. I'll leave that up to the viewer to decide, but it's obvious that a lot of people need their entertainment spoon fed to them and are unwilling to accept any ideas which are ground-breaking or do not fit the mold of what has been jammed down their throats in the world of sci-fi since 2001 came out.I must give props to one of my favorite bands, Underworld, who in large part composed the soundtrack and did an exceptional job heightening the emotions of this film.This is a film which must been seen in theaters to be fully appreciated, unless you have some ungodly home system. Prepare to be tense for nearly the entire film, and touched when it climaxes. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have seen movies like The Core or Event Horizon, you probably are thinking that this movie is something like that. But... you are wrong. Sunshine is sometimes boring, with unlikely things occurring and an awful plot. Sunshine is a movie which can be split up in 2 parts.-- This contains some spoilers --1st Part: A team travels, inside a spaceship called Icarus 2, to the sun to nuke it. Something familiar like The Core. You have the stereotyped persons and there is some tension between them. Special effect are excellent in this part! The radar picks up a signal of a spaceship which seems to be the Icarus 1, a spaceship that left Earth 7 years ago with the same mission. But then... the director seem to be out of time / or budget. Until now the movie was pretty much OK...2nd Part: They connect to the spaceship en some things go wrong. They decide to abort the ship and after that the movie changed drastically. I can remember me and everyone in the cinema laughing our asses off. A survivor of Icarus 1 transformed into Freddy Krueger and starts hack-and-slashing the remaining team members... It was such a disappointment. I loved The Core, Event Horizon and even Mission to Mars is fun when you like bad quotes and bad acting (and maybe when your under the influence). But this movie missed all those things...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We went to the cinema last night to give 'Sunshine' a shot. The flick seemed to be very promising during the first hour or so, then I do not know what happened. As some people have remarked here and whose opinions I support, the latter part of the flick turned out to be a total disaster. I left the theatre very dissatisfied. At any rate, the effects and scenery were all first class but for the plot, I cannot find words. The actors did a decent job, especially Cillian Murphy as 'Capa'. I would give the first part of the flick an 8 out of 10, but due to the disastrous latter part, I would not give the flick a total point of more than 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good sci-fi film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine has an influence of 2001:A Space Odyssey.I do not mention that as a fail,but I mention that as one of the best elements of the movie,because Sunshine is a return to the intelligent sci-fi which has a lot of fascinating ideas.But the ending is very weak because,on that moment,the intelligence and the slow tone go down and the film becomes an action sci-fi film.That change of tone did not like me.But,in spite of that weak ending,the film is pretty good.The slow tone of the movie emulates the parsimony of the interplanetary trip where the routine and the isolation become dangerous.Director Danny Boyle has won a very deserved success with Trainspotting.But,after that,he experimented with different stories and styles,something I find great.The results have been really interesting like the twisted romantic comedy A Life Less Ordinary,the realistic horror film 28 Days Later and the kids story Millions(I'm ignoring the false move of The Beach).Now,Boyle shows the complexity of science fiction and he backed to show that he's very talented regardless of the genre.Another good element of the film is that it does not have the typical phrases like ''When I go back home,I'll buy a boat''.But,now,I have to mention the negative point of Sunshine which is,like I said before,the ending because it abruptly changes the tone of the movie.Nevertheless,the overall result is a pretty good film,so I recommend Sunshine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first herd of this when I saw the trailer going to see another film. My first thought was "for **** sake not another space bull**** mission to save the world like the awful Armageddons and cores but then I saw the words Danny Boyle which made me think this my be different and worth seeing and boy was I right.I saw this film before its official release at a staff preview because my brother works there and gets me in free sometimes. So it ended up just being me, my dad, my brother and his girlfriend in this huge cinema screen alone. This could have helped as it gave quite an isolated feel which is done very well throughout the film. Mainly due to its great use of sound. This is often made up of engine sounds, creeks of machinery or ventilation fans wiring. Not only is sound used in this effective way but I also found the music to be brilliant a sought of uplifting feel with a use of harmony but also a very electronic feel. This just managed to en capture what music from the space would be like somehow.The cinematography also was beautiful. Which again en captures the feeling of isolation and atmosphere in space (from what I imagine it would be like.) and there are often moments of great suspense which is brilliantly done through the cinematography. This also leads me the spectacular CGI which often leads you thinking what is real and what is computer generated.But of course on of this really matters unless the story is any good. Now like I said at first I thought its going to be another bull**** sci-fi but it really does go deep with characters and there development each bringing a unique view to the ship. As for all the people saying o its just Space 2001 with a dash Event Horizon and although you can see the influences I think there is certainly enough originality to win on its own merits.So in conclusion Danny Boyle nails another genre and he makes his way to the Hollywood big bucks (although some may not approve of his move to Hollywood)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few make good Sci-Fi Movies.Most Sci-Fi movies opt for a mix of politics (Minority Report), disasters (Armageddon) or fantasy (Matrix) to assure box office success. The rest falls into the B-grade mediocre category, which diminished the genre's credibility.In the light of the rise of Sci-Fi shows such as Battlestar Galactica and upcoming Star Trek XI, Sunshine's timing is appropriate. After all, it boosts big names such as director Danny Boyle (Millions, Trainspotting) and Fantastic Four's Chris Evan and Michelle Yeoh.Good Sci-Fi films have a mix of science, research and technology. It bases future predictions with possible and speculative scenarios with present findings. In this case, the sun will die and lose its heat 50 years later. The only sense of hope is by sending a team of 8 in spaceship to reignite part of the sun.There are accidents, mistakes made and life endangering situations along the way. The excitement comes when the 8 struggles to survive, speculate and start losing their sanity. Mankind will not change, past or future. And the struggle to survive is their most basic instinct.The story starts off promisingly. Every cast member is representative of a certain type of human behaviour from the selfish, to stubborn, to the sacrificial. It has a good mix of international actors (especially Asians), probably so because predictions say that the future world will belong to the American and Asian powerhouses.Unfortunately, like the spaceship on the voyage, towards the end of the journey becomes mediocre and haphazard. Be prepared for an anti-climax. At least, the movie recovers itself before it falls into a bottomless pit.http://themovieclub.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing after good beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What to say about a movie that builds steady momentum and respect as it proceeds with a fairly typical sci-fi plot (the sun is dying so they have to deliver a "payload" of nuclear material into its core to save the Earth) but then abandons its own self-respect in the end? Basically this film almost ended up being as good as "Moon", but instead it's a far inferior attempt at modern space sci-fi poisoned with arbitrary mysticism and monsters.The film does offer excellent opportunities for some of the actors, particularly Cillian Murphy and Rose Byrne. Unfortunately poor performances from some of the cast like Michelle Yeoh undermine the better actors. But the first 2/3 of the movie or so is very absorbing. Murphy's character has to make an important choice, which leads to a lot of frustration on the part of some of his crew-mates and indirectly leads to a disaster when the ship's shields aren't properly aligned for a new flight trajectory.There are many moments of extreme gore, but I still felt everything could be justified by an intelligent and thought-provoking conclusion. Unfortunately the conclusion was just a bunch of lame action scenes with some irradiated astronaut psycho-killer trying to prevent them from saving the Earth. The whole thing becomes very pointless, and then it takes a tight turn at the last second for sentiment. Basically this is a Spielberg-esquire formula movie and it's OK as far as that type of thing is concerned but I was definitely hoping for more based on the way the story and characters were set up. None of the mystical stuff in connection to the Sun or the allusions to Icarus end up adding up to anything except vague groping for significance. There's no intellectual "payload" delivered to us at the end of the movie; no ideas and no questions. Just an OK story with OK effects and one really good actor trying to make something of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. It has taken me a few days to process my thoughts on the film. I went in with high expectations thanks to the brilliance of director Danny Boyle ("Millions", "28 Days Later", "Trainspotting"). I came out trying to decipher this unique approach to film-making and story telling.Sadly, I must conclude that while I admire the creativity and aspirations of those involved, this is pretty much a mess of a film. Parts of it look like a 1970's Pink Floyd concert. Parts are clear rip-offs/tributes to "2001: A Space Odyssey". Still others give you the feeling that it is about to spin off into "Alien". While each of those segments have merits, once assembled it ends up like bubble gum in a blender.Cillian Murphy. Cliff Curtis and Rose Byrne are both very solid in their roles, while Chris Evans ("Fantastic Four") is way over the top and Michelle Yeoh is reduced to pretty much standing/sitting or lusting after the vegetable garden.This will have no impact on my enthusiasm towards Danny Boyle's next project ... I admire his risk taking and unique approach. Just chalk this one up as one that just didn't work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ages that have passed since a proper sci-fi flick graced our collective screens melt away into cosmic flotsam and jetsam as soon as you spot the authentic looking starship models that open Sunshine. Coupled with that trusty old whooshing roar filmmakers associate with space travel, not only do they bring back fond memories of more innocent days but also herald the arrival of one solid interplanetary escapade.Not coy in the least about it's sources, Sunshine mixes the claustrophobia so well-liked in Alien with Event Horizon's sublime horror and Solaris' psychological desolation. Put together, these ingredients work well for Danny Boyle and company, much more so than in 28 Days Later, which shares some of the themes revisited here.Sunshine gets its name from a last-ditch effort to re-start the sun. Old Sol is dying faster than anticipated, and in some unnamed near future era the world has come around to collaboratively launch missions aimed at saving humanity from a fate worse than frosting over to death.Among the movie's greatest assets is its insistence on not showing much of the situation giving rise to this predicament or the preliminary effort that has gone into resolving the issue. This bestows upon it a delectably detached, isolated mood perfectly in tandem with the menacing experience that is flying through deep space towards a showdown with the entire world's looming demise.It's all up to the crew of Icarus II, a large and seemingly very advanced ship carrying a bomb the size of Manhattan. The device is supposed to fan the sun's no longer burning heart, if the math and physics are up to snuff. The craft, shielded by a vast screen to deflect the solar winds and radiation, makes its ponderous way onwards on the wake of Icarus I, the first mission that went AWOL some seven years prior to the story's beginning.Everything about the initial phases of the film screams classic science fiction, including the realistic visuals (that don't look like CGI at all, mind you), old school sound effects and the lived-in post-cyberpunk appeal of Icarus' interiors. There's dorms, a mess hall lifted almost by the numbers from the Nostromo (that's a good thing) and a verdant hydroponics farm to make oxygen and food. Neat stuff all around. The technology seen in Sunshine also makes sense, none of it over the top and all very well implemented. The same can be said of the entire production: it's impressive but in a utilitarian way. There's no tack for astronomical units.The crewmembers represent somewhat of a cross section of the global community, but since we know almost nothing about the time and places they hail from, it's all a big guessing game that helps fuel Sunshine's surreal mystery quotient.They consist of physicist Capa (Cillian Murphy), navigator Trey (Vincent Wong), psychologist Searle (Cliff Curtis), comms officer Harvey (Troy Garity), commander Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada), pilot Cassie (Rose Byrne), biologist Corazon (Michelle Yeoh returns!) and all-round tough guy Mace (Chris Evans).Although tensions exist among them as they enter the no-transmission dead zone, the mission seems to be going on track until a distress signal from the earlier Icarus outing is received. That's when, in true Alien fashion, all hell breaks loose and the Event Horizon, edge-of-the-solar-system syndrome goes to town on the hapless assembly.They begin to turn on each other, make mistakes and generally drop the plot. It soon becomes apparent that not all is as it seems and that something is on the ship with them in the role of uninvited guest and saboteur. Much of Sunshine consists of obvious allusions to previous works in the genre, but at least the film acknowledges this as crew members joke around about how they'll probably be picked off by ravenous aliens.As they try to figure out what's besetting them and how to continue the fateful mission no matter the odds, we are treated to both the immense powers and deep frailties of the human animal. All major elements are put into play, some ironically, for instance freezing mere steps from the sun. These almost anecdotal occurrences set the stage for an excellent ride full of color and sound, that despite a rather basic story succeeds in compelling and convincing there's more here than one viewing can hope to take in.It may disappointing that, in the end, Sunshine relies on a trite and uninspired antagonistic plot device to bring closure, but it's such an emotional, addictive story that you won't care. And the soundtrack is among the most outstanding we've heard in a long time.Take a long, contemplative look at this one. It may babble for a bit on stardust and other faux-existential items, but in the end the real message lies in execution instead of minutiae. This is a cosmic adventure not to be trifled with.Rating: * * * *</fullReview>

It also has no real scientific talk to explain how planting a big bomb on the sun will actually work. You never see earth or how the lack of sunlight affects it. There was more than one time in the movie where the "special effects" were so vague that I couldn't do anything but laugh...you have no idea what you're looking at, things don't even make sense, etc. Forget the money I spent renting this...I just want that two hours of my life back.

		<fullReview>Sunshine is a movie without an interesting or original story to tell.It is awash with clichés and unformed characters; a bog-standard sci-fi with nothing to add to the genre, but having taken plenty. The scene in which the crew have to jump through space from one airlock to another is especially derivative.Most of the film tells a fairly straightforward story of the world's most incapable, thoughtless and badly-behaved astronauts setting out to save the world, and failing dismally by making stupid mistakes and detouring (!) to another spaceship. You have already seen this part of the movie several times in different films.Later, the long-dead commander of the other spacecraft magically comes back to life and starts trying to kill the crew. He is some kind of burned-up supervillian monster who often drawls "ashes to ashes", though this makes little sense and has no dramatic effect.The uncomfortable and unsignalled lurch from sci-fi to horror is as badly executed as one of the crew's blundering manoeuvres. Confusing photography, in which parts of planets, the sun and spacecraft are shown in close-up sections, only adds to the confusion. What are we looking at? How is it moving? What significance, if any, does this have? Sunshine has no drama, shows no evidence of thought or skill in its genesis, creates no dramatic tension and presents no ideas. It is gloss, or light without meaning.</fullReview>

Some time in the mission human error results in the entire oxygen garden being destroyed, so they have to dock with the starship of the previous failed mission. There is a religious creep there who tries to sabotage this mission as well, in the end everything is OK.But really, nothing in the film makes any sense. The motivations of the crew are completely false, the physics are bad, there is no story anywhere outside of the main story arch which is, as you can see, pretty dumb.Bottom line: the special effects are good, not great, the rest is worthless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is absolutely nothing good to say about this film. It is a tedious and absurd story that goes absolutely nowhere.To start with, there is no set-up. The Earth is simply enduring a solar winter; we have to accept that without any sort of visual understanding. (It is only at the very end of the film that we see people in frozen Australia, and by then it is too late to care about them.) Secondly, the relationships between the crew are facile and directionless. The characters are nothing more than cardboard cut-outs - one loves her plants, another is devoted to the mission, while another is obsessed with being overwhelmed by the light of the sun - who say silly snappy things.But the the most ridiculous thing of all is the film's crisis - the engineer forgetting to calculate the angle of the deflection shields. It's only explained to us by the guy saying, "I f**ked up." No kidding. Where did they get this engineer? Is he one of these Interstate bridge experts? And forgetting his "f**k up", wouldn't the ship have some sort of protocol for changing the trajectory of the flight, rather than just letting one guy do it on his own? (See "Apollo 13".) And finally, the crazy burned-up captain from Icarus I was a real let-down, turning the end of the film into a Jason/Freddy Kruger rip-off. Sadly, this is an all-too-common escape mechanism for many films these, using slasher/suspense nonsense in place of a story.I was happy when they finally succeeded in their mission, because that meant the movie was over. Whoever pitched this movie as a sci-fi film in the style of "Alien" should be sent off on Icarus III.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a bit fan of sci-fi movies. I was hoping for some spectacular images of the universe. I have been to Houston many times and I will see that Imax movie over and over again and if I could afford it, I would buy myself a place in space shuttle without hesitation.Well, I did not get the spectacular images I was hoping for. I did not really understand the movie either. Or maybe I did. After all, it now seems to be clear that astronauts are not the highly trained perfectionists we always believed them to be, but some drunk diaper-wearing jealous maniacs.That explains the outburst of manliness and the lack of professionalism The rest somebody has to explain to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sunshine" Aims High And Falls Flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Science Fiction buff I had to go see this. The reviews were generally positive; and it has seven plus here on IMDb.Perhaps my expectations were raised too high; but I was quite disappointed with virtually all elements of the film except the images of Sol. This ain't no Alien or Blade Runner or even Solaris.The soundtrack was coarse and overly loud, the casting was lightweight, the direction hyper, the story had great potential but was burdened by a pedestrian script.Some of the science seemed way off base. I have no idea how they all managed to seem to be operating in a normal gravity field; that one was the weirdest.Finally, given the redundancy/resiliency evidenced of the AI system in other parts of the movie, the key blunder that the whole movie turns on is utterly uncredible (as in unbelievable).On the other hand if you're looking for sheer cartoonish science fiction that makes lots of noise and even more pretensions; this is your baby.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've seen Event Horizon or Solairs then you've already seen Sunshine. Why this inane story was remade once again I just can't tell. Spoilers ahead: Long space journey with crew on the edge, mysterious 'other' space ship, crew member of other ship has seen God and gone insane and kills everyone. Don't waste 2 hours of your life watching it, especially if like me you've already seen either or both of the other films.The big finale left me not giving a damn. So what if he didn't save everyone on earth? I hadn't even seen anyone on earth in whatever year it is so why should I care if they are saved? And the ignition sequence didn't make any sense whatsoever. Why was it so essential to set off the sequence by hand? An atomic bomb hurtling into the heart of the sun... I think there's a fair chance that it would somehow have ignited.But there's a chance that I'm being unreasonably harsh on Sunshine exactly because it's such a rip off of both of the other movies I've seen and I may be dumping the collective ire solely on Sunshine. Of the three, Event Horizon was the worst and had almost precisely the same story except it was the core of an engine rather than the core of the sun that made the captain of the other space ship go insane. i only saw the remake of Solaris so I was annoyed that I had seen it after Event Horizon and was watching the same ethereal story, though to be fair the original Solaris was made in the 1970s so ti was the first attempt at this story line. I know a lot of people will not like my review just because they disagree with my opinion on the movie and that's fair enough. But the fact remains that this is an unoriginal idea that has been done before and for that, shame on Danny Boyle and Alex Garland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can somebody please tell me, why there are people rating this awfully boring movie with a 10? My friend and I left after 30 minutes, already bored to death. It starts with somebody looking like a DJ (not like an astronaut or scientist) doing something very stupid, means looking directly into sunlight. He is the captain or something like that. It continues with stupid behavior, like people starting to beat each other up on a spaceship, for apparently no reason - who selected these guys to be astronauts in the first place? I thought there is at least some degree of self-control required to get this job? Then they need to show how beautiful life can be, by some waves breaking on a wharf with some people enjoying this. Give me a break! Watching this pathetic attempt just made me miss "Alien" so much, I couldn't stand it any longer. This is a 100% artificially constructed movie with boring wann-be actors, with no style, and with no character at all. It shows no own identity and is mounted together from "if we add this, we will reach this target group" scenes. Please stop it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers spoilers spoilers ahead I went to see this movie because I'd heard it was 'in the tradition of 2001' and that Rose Byrne played the captain of the ship. Wrong on both points.Faults? Where to start! The actors don't look like astronauts, for one thing. As others here have said, they don't talk like astronauts either. I can't imagine Arthur C Clarke and Stanley Kubrick hunched over a typewriter writing as dialogue for *either* Frank Poole or Dave Bowman: 'I f***ed up! I f***ed up!!' etc.Also, what are we supposed to think: that the navigation officer got out his slide rule and a seven-figure book of logarithms and calculated the new orbit on a really big piece of butcher paper? When they've got a quasi-sentient computer on board? That does not compute, and as soon as a movie departs from the sort of 'science fiction logic' that tells us the computer would have calculated the entire rendezvous orbit, orbital insertions, burns etc, and, yes, adjusted the necessary filter angles etc, even a mainstream (ie non-sf-hardcore) audience knows it's being sold a pup.My heart sank when I saw the meal-eating scene: ie such a blatant ripoff of ALIEN. When it got to 'we're outside and haven't got enough spacesuits etc, so let's fire the explosive bolts and get in that way' I was tempted to say out loud to the person I was seeing the movie with (a fellow 2001 nut): 'we've seen this before'. (I never talk in the movies, and neither does he; and nor should you.) What else? Oh yeah, they had one spacesuit prior to their 'let's all hold our breaths' scene, so what was to stop one of them from going across, space-suited, and bringing back extra suits? Or did I blink and miss something here?Finally, where was the Icarus One? In space? I'm not 'calling' a fault here, I'd just like to know. Watching the movie I thought it had crash landed on Mercury; in addition to all the other faults I simply found it a hard movie to follow.Rose was pretty, though, I'll give it that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Space No One Can Hear You Scream For Your Time and Money Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Boyle's Sunshine is the perfect remake of Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space with a bigger budget and majestic visual effects. Except for being a science fiction film, it doesn't resemble Plan 9 in story but like Ed Wood, I think Danny Boyle and crew deliberately set out to make a horrible movie, one that gives the middle finger to the audience, mocking us for watching. Sunshine is a social experiment: how many people can we fool into liking this garbage--make them think it's the reincarnation of 2001--by putting amazing FX over such an obviously terrible script.The story is set in the future when the sun is dying. A space crew is dispatched to solve this problem. On board is a nuclear bomb or several that only can be released by one man, the scientist Cappa (Cillian Murphy). Much of the action takes place right when the ship is closest to the sun, when the crew discover that an earlier ship, sent out seven years before and with the same mission, is floating out in space. They decide to board the ship and use it's bomb along with their bomb so that they can have a better chance.But there's one problem: Cappa is the most cursed character in recent movie history. Everyone that does any mission with him on and off the ship ends up dead. When the shields fail, as they must, the captain inexplicably--since he's the only one who knows how to, um, save mankind-- orders him into a precarious space walk. Bye, bye captain. Similar scenes go on, with each member of the crew dying in some way.But the crew has other problems besides an astronaut angel of death. It turns out that the first mission failed because someone for no reason that is explained, sabotaged the ship. Apparently they wanted all of humanity to die. But, this madman is still alive, even though it's seven years later, there's no food or water, and he's near enough to the sun to reach out and touch it. But he only has slight skin burns! What had been a standard space adventure turns into the most preposterous horror movie of recent years. The first two-thirds, Boyle shows us wide scope, haunting shots of orange and yellow. The sun is beautiful and it becomes the only thing of creativity in a cliché ridden movie. The crew are all types: the dutiful soldier, the loving earth mother, the requisite love interest. The shots have the standard close ups of the actors coming in from the left and right of the screen, there is a blueish, metallic sheen over everything. This has been seen in Solaris and every other sci-fi space movie. It's well done but unimaginative.The third act rockets what would have been a typical genre exercise into the outer reaches of absolutely terrible. The crew has to kill one of it's own. Why? I have no idea. The madman somehow enters the ship; mind you, he's got no suit on, he's naked in fact, and yet he manages to travel the long distance from ship to ship and enter a closed vessel without anybody noticing. Then he kills Maggie Yeoh (really? Why?) with a drill through her heart. Another crew member gets his legs shredded underwater and we see the blood floating; then cut to a completely sadistic shot of poor Maggie Yeoh again, sitting dead with that drill in her heart. Then the camera decides to forgo the solemn and detailed shots of the first half of the movie and go in a frenetic jumble of faces, limbs and very bright stuff. By the end of this movie, you think it's a satire of our Homeland Security warning system, making us hate the colors of orange and yellow. Oh, and Cillian Murphy somehow loses his space suit when he jumps into the cube that is the bomb: one minute he's wearing it, and the next it's gone. I think he detonates the bomb from the inside, with a small radio even though he's in the bomb! Other unbelievable things: why did it take seven years to send out another ship, since, you know, if all of earth will be destroyed time is of the essence. Why couldn't they send two or 10 ships at the same time? I felt angry after this movie ended, something I've never felt over a movie. In that regard, Sunhine succeeds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a fan of SF i was really looking forward to seeing this film (sadly could not see it in cinema due to hospital) and i wish i had stayed there. This is like the new star wars films where you are meant to go "ooohhhh pretty" at the sfx but forget about the writing,what was this film meant to be? A man against the clock to save everyone film or a really bad alien clone? The start of the film works well (apart from these intelligent people being so dumb you wonder how they lasted the 16 months till the film starts) but at the end it looks like the writers suffered from ADHD and lost interest so tacked on a bit of alien to try and keep the plot going. I think the end would have been better (after the "we don't know what will happen due to mass etc" computer simulation) if the first attempt had failed and they went back and managed to restart Icarus 1 and for added mass rode the whole ship into the sun,this of course would have worked and for the feel good factor they use the computer (that needs no air) back towards earth broadcasting final messages to the families of the astronauts. Really think i could have done better.If anyone asks if you want to see this film run away screaming unless you can be kept happy for hours by shiny things.</fullReview>

Shame on Sky for charging for this ? it really ought to be consigned to the bottom of the loss leader basket at the local video store.It was a sort of cross between 2001 and a rather bad 'Schmaltzy American Hero Movie". 2001 was a little hard to follow and the original Solaris was obtuse, but at least they broke some new ground.This film was totally incoherent, meaningless and lacking in any drama whatsoever.It was obviously a misguided homage to 2001, but lacked any of it's subtlety and intelligence. "Plan 9 from Outer Space" had a more engaging plot.One can only assume that the director, producer and scriptwriter had taken huge quantities of mind altering substances (they were funded by the UK National Lottery) during the making of this film, as all of them were clearly confused throughout.The worst thing is that someone whose writing I had previously admired, Alex Garland (writer of "The Beach"), is credited as writer.He may well have got well paid ? but he's lost all credibility as a serious writer after this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Unforgettable SUNSHINE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first time seeing Danny Boyle's SUNSHINE was at a private screening in London. After a brief introduction of the film, the lights dimmed and I was immersed into a world of eight individuals traveling to the Sun to save mankind.First off, I was never a big follower of science fiction movies... until SUNSHINE. I admit that my first time watching it, I was speechless (in a good way). The visuals were stunning, and there were moments in the film that held so much meaning within minutes of screen time. I knew much thought went into this film from the start. For those of you who think setting this dramatic scenario 50 years from now makes this film "wrong," there's special reason for that. According to SUNSHINE's scientific consultant Dr. Brian Cox, five billion years is too far in the future for audiences to be able to relate to. "By setting the action just 50 years in the future, [...] it gives us something we can worry about." (Source: http://space.newscientist.com/) This idea is logical, and it does make you understand the true nature of what it means to have a dying Sun.But reigniting the sun is only a piece of what is to be seen from SUNSHINE. The diverse cast gave life into their characters. Nothing seemed out of place. If you read up on the characters' back-stories from SunshineDNA.com, they help you to understand why certain characters did what they did. You also get to witness the psychological strains that each of the characters experience, with special thanks to Danny Boyle's amazing invention of the 'Helmet Cam' that's placed inside the spacesuits. Those shots were amazing, hands-down.SUNSHINE is a film you have to watch at least twice. The first time you might be overwhelmed by the themes that are presented. The second may clarify your personal thoughts on it as a whole. Either way, you'll be leaving the theater with much to think about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't like the film particularly. I thought Cillian Murphy was superb, very restrained, but that the general acting followed a similar trend in the story, ideas and texture of the film; i.e. that they were simply borrowed, if not contrived.The UK critics have been almost uniform in their accolades, at once recognising Danny Boyle's homage assembly but nonetheless commending it on its own terms. In this specifically I feel there's a strange confusion. The film doesn't really know whether to be a mystic film (2001: A Space Odessy), an action-horror (Event Horizon or Pitch Black) or a CGI vehicle (Armageddon). It's none of these, allowing no space for any themes to breathe or develop. And everyone talks about Tarkovsky's Solaris - Sunshine is much more like Soderbergh's version with it's more mobile narrative and visual effects, but without Soderbergh's due attention to the characters and their relationships.It is a competent matinée. The drama is based in reality, from the dying sun concept to the not impossible twist. Additionally Boyle's personal visual tropes, most familiar from 28 Days Later, are exciting in themselves. But we've seen better outings of it all - ideas, sequences, shocks, visuals even the score - before. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of Sunshine, I was cautiously optimistic. The good reviews both here and from the press further raised my hopes of a return to intelligent science fiction from the (sometimes fun but formulaic) action films masquerading as science fiction.Unfortunately, it was not.The science was poor, the characters were largely unemphatic and the blurry distortion scenes towards the end were laughably bad. You could think of it as a mix of Space 2001 with Event horizon, but taking the worst properties of each. The over gratuitous and long winded cinematic shots of 2001 and the boring characterization and the sci-fi cum horror of Event horizon.It is a pity, because the first ten minutes look hopeful, and the acting and effects are good. However, at the end of the day the science, plot and character psychology are not really explored at more than a superficial level. The movie doesn't have anything else to fill up this gaping void.Maybe there is an editors cut out there that adds 30 minutes of footage to make this a decent movie, but as it stands 5/10.</fullReview>

I do not believe in spoiling movies in these comments, so I can't really elaborate too much, but for example: let's just say that if you're in the middle of a space walk and you're relatively close to the sun, you wouldn't be floating around.I thought the acting was mediocre, and the forced conflicts were very unrealistic. Some of the ideas that caused incredible angst for the cast should have been no-brainers, considering the situation and what was going on.Part of the movie was a clear rip-off of 2001 (homage? maybe), but I found those parts to be insulting to Kubric.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst-commanded space mission of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As others here have pointed out, this is basically a monster/horror film. It has "philosophical" pretensions, but they're not very compelling because it's pointless to philosophize about events that would never happen even granting the movie's premise (i.e. that the sun is "dying"). I mean, if you're putting together a trillion-dollar mission to save the Earth, who would you crew it with? Cool, extremely disciplined, seasoned professional pilots, engineers and scientists -- y'know, like the ones NASA picks, or like the guys in "2001" -- or this group of yammering neurotics? Sure, real astronauts are boring, but that's the point: You WANT a mission like this to be boring; that's how it succeeds. That's also why command decisions are left to commanders, not turned over to crewmen (like the clown in charge of this mission does); it's why astronauts aren't so incredibly undisciplined and stupid as to risk injury by getting into fistfights; and it's why any remotely complex maneuver, like changing course, involves several people and a CHECKLIST, not one guy who's expected to keep all the procedures in his head. (And please do NOT tell me that the fights, mistakes, crackups, etc. are the result of all the months in space. You know how long real astronauts spend in space these days, and in much more cramped quarters, without any lapses in professionalism? In this movie's world, human beings are apparently so emotionally fragile that you can't even find eight or so who can be adequately trained for the stresses ahead.) If you want "characters" on your movie spaceship, then you need to do what the makers of "Armageddon" did and find a reason for putting them there (like, the killer asteroid is fast approaching, and only this particular motley crew of oil-drillers has the specific expertise needed to destroy it -- and even then, they have to undergo a lot of training). By foregoing plausibility, "Sunshine" just makes its philosophizing phony; it's not thought-provoking to wonder why stupid consequences follow from stupid decisions by stupid people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danny Boyle is an extremely talented director, he proved this in Trainspotting and then once again for me with the superb zombie movie 28 Days Later. He is also a director who likes to try his hand at completely different things. To date he's done Trainspotting, The Beach, Millions, 28 Days Later and now this, Sunshine. As you can see from the few movies I listed he does do very different movies. Now my excitement levels for Sunshine reached sky high when the trailers arrived, they promised a movie that was something along the lines of Armageddon without the cheesiness and the horrible "God bless America" feel to it. What it failed to mention was how nail bitingly tense the movie would be. My excitement for Sunshine was high, but the movie still surprised me and completely blew me away. Sunshine is a perfect example of a sci-fi thriller. Very few movies manage to pull this off, in fact with the notable exception of Alien I can safely say I haven't seen any others do it all that well. Sunshine works not only for its well staged action sequences and incredible atmosphere (see the ship boarding sequence, won't spoil it), but also its sheer beauty. And there are moments of complete and utter beauty in this movie, the opening shot especially is something to behold. Sunshine easily takes the number 1 spot to date for my favourite movie of 2007, it might not have the most original ideas within it, but it is executed so superbly it not only proves Danny Boyle is a force to be reckoned with, but also that you don't need limitless amounts of money for a movie to look beautiful (Sunshine was made for a low $40 million).The actual premise for Sunshine is an intriguing one, and one that makes the movie so much more interesting. Wha happens when our Sun eventually dies? What will we do to carry on living? Its a scary thought because obviously the sun will not last forever and this does really get you thinking. But after the initial thinking process the movie nose dives into the actual nightmare scenario. As soon as a radio transmission is picked up the movie suddenly goes into supersonic. I won't say anymore as I really don't want to ruin anything, but the tension rises dramatically. And as things go really wrong you will be biting your nails while sitting on the edge of your seat, I know I was for definite.The actual characters in Sunshine can be a bit stereotypical at times, cool American hero, cowardly second in command etc. But the actual actor themselves are more than able to makes these characters work. Cillian Murphy adds another terrific performance to his CV, Chris Evans surprises me yet again as he really has come out as a really talented actor, Michelle Yeoh does another great job in her great, though sadly underused role, and the rest of the little cast each fill their roles perfectly. For the first half hour things start slowly as we begin to get to know the characters. For some people this might be frustrating, I however loved it as the inspiration from Alien was very clear. In that movie as well tension was built up with the slow build up, made me appreciate the movie just that little bit more.So then, the faults of Sunshine? I can't point any out, I enjoyed it that much. Its a movie with a great idea behind it, a great cast and also some great set pieces. People may complain about the ending or beginning, but those two bits are down to personal taste more than anything else. Both worked superbly for me and make this a movie that will undoubtedly be a top ten of 2007 movie for me. Beautiful, tense and action packed all in one movie, another superb addition to Danny Boyle's increasing list of great movies.</fullReview>

I don't care for romance or most comedies, and tend not to even care about giving those types of films a chance, hence I think it takes a sci-fi liking to watch and rate this film. It looks great on my 52 inch plasma with the lights down, good solid story line, good acting makes this one of my top 10 films of all times. There seems to be a lot of people trying to work out why it did not do well at the box office. And yes I agree with most people that hardly any promotion was done down here in Australia? Is it cause we are on the ass end of the world? A real shame! But watch it, give it a change, sure it has similar feelings of other sci-fi films, but then again what is a real original these days? I thought it tapered of a bit towards the end, but the overall feel and look of the film makes up for it. Love it or hate it, I still gave it a 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 meets Event Horizon - yes, that's exactly what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be completely amazing. Movies simply don't get any better than this. Which is why I was surprised to see so many people hating on this film. If you're a sci-fi fan, or an avant-garde fan - you MUST see this movie.As a film goer, I pretty much dislike most movies I see, cause most movies are STUPID - made for IDIOTS. This movie was recommended by a friend, and when it first started, I thought, "Event Horizon without the character development". Eventually that changed to "2001 without the pretentious orchestra music". Somewhere along the way, I stopped thinking about what this movie was like, and fell completely into what I was watching.Sure, everything the haters say about this movie are probably true. But the fact is that this movie grabbed me so hard, that I simple didn't notice any plot holes or scientific mistakes it made. It was just the movie and me, and that feeling doesn't happen often anymore.What really struck me about Sunshine was the visuals. NOT the visuals in themselves, but more how the visuals were communicating something to me that I'd never really felt from a movie before. I've never had the cinematography and editing of a movie communicate something so effectively before. This movie was an awesome mesh of horror, cinematic poetry, and the meaning of life and reality - no joke. To dismiss it as a knockoff of Event Horizon or 2001 is really to miss the genius of it. In many ways it's better than both these movies, cause it has meaning, where Event Horizon had none. And it has emotion, where 2001 pretty much had none. I was CRYING at the end of the movie, not for any other reason that because I was having an existential moment. HOW many movies will do that to you? huh? I'm not a Danny Boyle fan or an Alex Garland fan. This is the first movie I've like of either of theirs. But I have to say, Boyle has insane genius.This movie captured a transcendent beauty and an unspeakable feeling, while at the same time getting kind of crazy. IT SIMPLY DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a particularly beautiful day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blown away. Absolutely blown away. Danny Boyle has once again crafted a spectacular masterpiece of film making. When i first heard the premise, i thought, "*sigh* another crappy Armageddon, or The Core. Craptacular piece of rubbish." I was wayyyyyy wrong.It starts with them already on their mission. That's the first step to being greater than disaster movies of the past. No more wasted time of how their lives were before the mission. No more wasted time with technological mumbo jumbo. It cuts out the bullsh!t and gets to what we want.The chronicles of the team are so engaging, you'll find yourself enthralled with each and every moment. The action is best quality. The visual effects are amazing. These are only surpassed by the emotional depth of the movie. Every character has their moments of feeling where they are at peace, and happy, to the other end of the spectrum and on the brink of insanity. Character feel for those lost, and the consequences are more than some can take.The climactic ending will leave you in awe. I give this a perfect 10 out of 10 and my highest recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally! A Disaster Pic that's not a Disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do most disaster pics have in common? The mundane, trivial, and stereotypical personal relations are more important than the impending doom the character's are facing.At least Danny Boyle's "Sunshine" focuses more on the catastrophe at hand rather than who's going to win over the girl in a heated love triangle.Like Apollo 13, Sunshine has likable characters that work together to save humanity. Their #1 priority is to fulfill the mission, even if it takes their lives to do so.The dialogue scenes are taut and makes the audience feel that their right there with them. As with 28 Days later, Boyle takes a serious approach to Sci Fi. Sure, this movie doesn't have a rising silver surfer or radioactive spiders, but the tension is real.Of course, the film has its flaws. Cillian Murphy's character is too one-dimensional at times; interesting themes that the film purports are not fully realized; and the third act turns into a bit of a cheap slaughter movie.But the suspense never disappoints. And the reasoning and logic the characters use during their arguments are fascinating and authentic. Kudos to Boyle for bringing in vibrant shots and using special effects wisely.Sorry, Armageddon fans. There are no parental reconciliation moments and picnics under sunset scenery. But shouldn't characters in disaster movies focus first on saving the world so we can continue to experience those wondrous moments? Michael Bay, please take note.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can burn every print of Armageddon, Deep Impact, Volcano, The Core etc. because there is no point in seeing them after a viewing of this film. This film is everything those movies ever wished they could be. I am not a hardcore sci-fi fan, and I don't want to spoil anything but Sunshine was fine entertainment, mixed with edge of your seat thriller. It brings up many philosophical questions about existence like all the great sci-fi films before it have. It is also relevant to this fleeting world we live in. It is on par with Alien and Blade Runner, I can only hope that this revives the harder sci-fi genre films, like 28 Days Later did for zombies (even if their is an overflow of crap imitations, a few good films will be green lit that may never have been made). see it, even if it is just to tell me I'm wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visibly Startled walking out of this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first say that I am always a brutally tough critic when it comes to movies. It' very rarely I ever walk out of a movie satisfied from start to finish. Sunshine was without question the first movie I have ever ended up walking out of the theater, literally startled. It was written all over my face. This movie reminded me of the sole reason movies should be made: To keep the audience glued to their seats and the screen. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire movie. There were so many opportunities for Director Danny Boyle to "cop out", and let his movie have moments without the feeling of authenticity (Reference Event Horizon, Mission to Mars). However he did just the opposite. This film had stellar acting from a well put together cast, amazing cinematography, special effects, and last but not least a great story tied in with perfect mood setting music to keep the viewer feeling uncomfortable. It was as if Boyle managed to take the elements from 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Alien blending them perfectly, but even improving on some of the things that made those movies classics for a previous generation. I think what people are missing who complained about the third act was the inspiration behind it. Without the central character you see in the final act, it forces the movie to lose its moral question: Why would we save humanity when mother nature has different plans?. So for me it was essential the third and final act played out the way it did. The bottom line is in my eyes this movie is a masterpiece on so many levels. I recommend it to anyone who wants to be surprised, shocked, and feel a full range of emotions when spending two hours in a movie theater. Enjoy!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Fantastic See This Film NOW</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Sunshine, Danny Boyle has created one of the greatest science fiction films of the last few decades.This is a grand science fiction epic and an intimate character study rolled into one. In a genre where CGI has too often become a substitute for characters, Boyle makes fantastic use of his special effects masterfully. There's a sense of grandeur and epic scope to this film that's been missing in pictures which make more liberal use of computer effects.This is a film about madness, hope, desperation, mistakes, and the links between people. We get to know these characters and care about them as they're put in an impossible situation.This is a beautiful film that anyone who likes science fiction should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Sunshine In An Otherwise Dreary Summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget about "Transformers" and "Live Free or Die Hard." THIS is the action/adventure movie of the summer. Superficially, the plot resembles "Armageddon": a team of astronauts must deliver a nuclear warhead to the sun, or mankind is doomed. But this is light-years away in tone. Think "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Solaris" (the original, not the superfluous remake), with a little bit of "Silent Running" and "Alien" thrown in. If the boogeyman at the end can't quite live up to all the setup, it's because they're working on a limited budget; "Sunshine" cost a fraction of the typical Hollywood blockbuster, but has much greater impact. Take that, Michael Bay!*** SPOILER ALERT *** I read some of the negative reviews of this film, and was disconcerted by the vehemence of some of the criticism. Most of it seems to come from "hard" science fiction fans who complain that "Sunshine" plays fast and loose with physics. They seem to be particularly incensed by the scene at the end where the physicist communes with the sun for several seconds instead of being immediately consumed. While I agree this is scientific nonsense, there are at least two explanations, one pseudoscientific, the other metaphysical, that fit within the premise of the movie. First, the pseudoscientific one. The physicist explains near the beginning of the movie that due to the intense gravitational field near the sun, the normal rules of space and time don't apply. In the fight scene with the captain of the Icarus I that precedes the disputed scene, time is clearly shown speeding up and slowing down repeatedly. So it is possible that time simply stopped while the physicist communed with the sun, then started up again. Second, the metaphysical one. The physicist may be having an "Occurrence At Owl Creek" moment where his entire life flashes before his eyes before he is obliterated. Given the religious underpinnings of the movie?the sun is God, or at least a divine manifestation thereof; the physicist is looking upon or accepting God; the physicist is, Christ-like, sacrificing himself to redeem humanity?this seems plausible, and I believe is Danny Boyle's intent. Neither of these explanations, of course, will satisfy "hard" science fiction fans. But to put things in historical perspective: there was similar carping about the ending of "2001: A Space Odyssey" when it was first released, and now it's considered a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this last night in Boston, I have to say, I was truly blown away by it. Danny Boyle has now proved his reputation as a great film maker with his great attention to detail and sense of imagination. Along with that comes the great acting of the cast, especially by Cillian Murphy and Chris Evans. If you can get into the story, you actually get the same feeling of fear and lack of sanity that the characters get from the outside space and when Pinbacker finally comes into the picture. All of which is wrapped up in some of the most epic, spectacular, and grandest imagery ever put to film. Not in a long time have I seen a great science fiction movie that actually opened up the genre to any imagination!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gorgeous Science Fiction film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but one that's not without its fair share of plot holes and WTF moments. The fact that Danny Boyle made this film for $14 million US is testament to his craftmanship and technical efficency as a film maker.This has the gloss of Solaris, the realistic and scientific elements of 2001: A space Oddessy and the shocking terror of Event Horizon. The film just looks amazing, and the CGI which ILM had nothing to do with is almost seamless, and is also proof that the Brits know how to make a decent flick.Its really a film for sci-fi lovers, and understandably not everyone will get it. Its pretty much a relentless ride from the opening scene, and the pressure of the Icarus II crew is felt from the get-go. You can really see the emotional fatigue from the crew members, as the weight of the entire human race is resting on their shoulders.The last half of the film, literally flips from one genre to the next and in some ways feels like it was thrown in there as a last minute descion. But I guess they were taking a risk, and some will think it was pulled off, others will not understand what Boyle and writer Alex Garland were trying to accomplish.I'd say overall its a great take on the sc-fi genre, and it deserves to be watched. But like all films, it ain't perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a great song of familiar elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neil Sedaka once said something along the lines of the following. I remember watching the interview. It was a good one."There is nothing new in Rock and Roll. Styles come, styles go and styles repeat themselves. The important thing to remember is that when everything has been done, and everything has been tried, all that will be left are the great songs." I thought that was a pretty incisive quote and it applies perfectly to "Sunshine".Critics have commented that what Danny Boyle and Alex Garland have done is to make a movie by piercing together their favourite bits from other Science Fiction films. I have heard these films mentioned. "2001: A Space Odyssey", "Dark Star", "Event Horizon", "Alien", "Silent Running". I wouldn't disagree with one word of that assessment.What I would say, and I don't like using this particular word because it is overused by overexcited blockbuster reviewers, is that "Sunshine" is absolutely Brilliant and as of this weekend is my favourite film of the year so far. It is an astonishing good film. Thoughtful and strange. "Sunshine" stuck in my head that much that I didn't want to see another film this weekend, for the fear of spoiling the feeling."Sunshine" is a mix of the hallucinatory feel of "2001: A Space Odyssey" (especially the ambiguous ending), the grungy, working spaceship dynamics of "Dark Star" (and the character Pinback is referenced), the race against time plotting of "Event Horizon", the tension and claustrophobia of "Alien" and the Eco awareness of "Silent Running". There are really great performances in this movie, but Chris Evans in particular is a real stand out as a cold and ruthless scientist. He completely buries his smart alec persona from "Fantastic Four" (which is a film I liked) and emerges as quite an interesting actor. There are amazing special effects (this movie was apparently made for 50 million dollars, which is frankly chicken feed) and is black and dark and weird.It's a great song of familiar elements.A few years ago Danny Boyle was in the frame to make "Alien: Resurrection". Such a shame. On this showing he should have been given the job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another gem from Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, 28 days later). It starts out on board the Icarus 2, a spaceship attached to an atom bomb the size of Manhattan Island. The crew are going about their tasks normally, with the odd argument here and there, when they receive a distress signal from Icarus 1 (the ship that attempted this mission before I2). They go to investigate and thats when this film turns from a spectacular sci-fi film, into a teen slasher flick. Thats all i'm going to say because i've been sat here for about an hour trying to figure out how to explain this film without spoilers. I give the first two thirds of the movie a 9/10, but because of the last third i will slide it down to a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting take on a familiar formula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What if you were responsible for saving all of mankind? The whole idea of "one man having the fate of the world in his hands" is a thriller cliché that has been been used so many times it has practically been driven into the ground by now. "Sunshine" offers an extreme and original look at that paradigm. The set of characters is a group of scientists on their approach to the dying Sun in order to re-start it (the concept is explained in more detail in the film) so that life on Earth can survive. All they know is that the device they plan on using is theoretical and never-been tested before other than mathematical calculations and the mission that was sent out before them, with an identical device, lost contact and didn't seem to accomplish its mission.Now, after months of preparation and months in space unrest, nerves and unforeseen dangers start to take hold. It plays out terrifically with a steady build up that gets into the skin of each character. Each scene is directed with the next scene or even few scenes in mind. The tension builds up and in the end it doesn't blow up, but rather swells. Like mentioned before, the clichés are avoided, and even slyly ridiculed. There are no aliens or conspiracy or "hidden orders" yet setting of a huge bomb is the characters' goal. That last bit is just slightly reminiscent of a film like "Armageddon." In fact, it can even be said that this is the polar opposite of a film like "Armageddon" and in more ways than one. Some reasons have already been mentioned, but the other key thing is a lack of sensationalism which is something Hollywood usually refuses to do and it usually ends up being ridiculous. Even if they do manage to make the film entertaining ("Armageddon" was pretty enjoyable), but it is still ridiculous."Sunshine" is that same "save the world" scenario but with a much more realistic approach on virtually all fronts. The science, the characters and an interesting goal to fix an interesting, and frightening, problem. This is all woven into a tight script and thus it is simply a good and well made movie. Even the special effects are great. --- 8/10BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really can't say enough good things about this film. Generally, I like Danny Boyle, but I'm always a bit weary going into his films since they tend to go against my expectations. I like all of his films I've seen (with the exception of A Life Less Ordinary) but they had to grow on me over time. Sunshine is the first Boyle film that I liked the first time I saw it. In fact, I loved it!The writing is brilliant. Garland has a gift for expressing huge ideas through his characters' words and actions. One of the many things that separates Sunshine from all other disaster movies is its humanity. The characters here are all important, each playing a specific role within the group. None of them are "victims." The cast is dynamite. It's a good mixture of familiar faces and new blood. Everybody puts 110% into their performances. It's difficult to pick out favorites since they're all so good. (That being said, Chris Evans's performance impressed the hell out me.) The special effects are stunningly beautiful. Every color on the spectrum gets screen time, making the film very pleasing to the eye. The sun's beauty is indescribable. The yellows and oranges are very deep and rich. Also, the FX are frequent but used effectively. Nothing looks fake or unrealistic.John Murphy and Underworld work together to deliver a great soundtrack. It's unlike a typical science fiction score. They, like Garland, tap into human emotion to give weight to the scenes with music.Another thing this movie does effectively is express the vastness of space, which is something that is overlooked by most other science fiction films. It really adds to the feeling of isolation and tightens the screw on the tension. Some of the science is inaccurate, but nothing comes across as absolute bunk.I can't get enough of this movie. Everything is so damn good it never gets old. This is one I strongly recommend to everybody. It's definitely a must-see for sci-fi fans, but I think it's got enough human drama to appeal to non sci-fiers. In conclusion, Sunshine is a triumph for Mr. Boyle, who proves he can direct any genre he sets his eyes on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, my first posting here, and since i know my English isn't perfect, since it isn't my home language, i want to excuse that.But back to topic, the movie Sunshine: The movie Sunshine begins, with a dark earth, since sunlight is backing away, the sun is dying. As you know, that is hopefully Science Fiction, with the sun dying in 50 years, it also brings a lot of questions. What if, in speculation, this would be a true scenario, in maybe 500 or 1000 years. The mankind isn't so far, to advance to distant star systems, now or in 1000 years the future. So all in all, it seems to me, that the solutions portrayed in this movie, in regard to physics and mathematics, are believable and natural. I personally like this movie, cause it talks of thematics, which could be(not can be), and it does talk about this thematics very good.My conclusion is, that we (Mankind) should be thankful, that the events in this movie, are far far in the future(our sun dying in 4-5 thousand million years)Hopefully this review of IMHO a genial movie doesn't count me out, since it is my first review.</fullReview>

I mean you get the whole burnt effect in a way that only Danny Boyle does...the direction is fast,claustrophobic and with many effects blur,flashes like a modern video-clip!!!!! The soundtrack is a pleasure(it's the second collaboration of John Murphy and Danny Boyle since 28 days later)the man can write awesome &amp; dreamy music!!!!! the cast selection is really good and the roles are perfectly matched with the actors..which give damn good performances!!!! so..enough said...leave your PC..go rent or buy the movie and just watch it!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent, thoughtful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reviews on this film seem very mixed, to say the least. Some people truly hate it; others, like me, find it a riveting meditation on the human condition not unlike the great Medieval "Ship of Fools" stories in which a cross-section of society is trapped on a vessel and must come to grips with all its simultaneous goodness and evil. This film is more of a "Grand Hotel" in space; indeed, one could argue that it falls into a category popularly called "space opera." As always, Danny Boyle has a remarkable eye, many scenes being so gorgeous to look at that you get lost in wonder. The acting, as well, is top notch; again, Cillian Murphy gives us a stand-out, riveting performance. The film has an excellent, spare screenplay Alex Garland, who also wrote the screen play for another Danny Boyle hit, 28 DAYS LATER.The biggest plus of this film is the remarkable tension that Boyle is able to build as, one by one, members of the space mission's crew are "picked off" by something mysterious.So while there are aspects of this film that might remind the viewer of "Alien," "Red Planet," and at least a couple of recent "Dr. Who" episodes, Boyle treats anything familiar in a fresh way. If you like thoughtful films that allow you to think (rather than shoot 'em up action films where everything's spelled out), then this is a film you might thoroughly enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awe and Wonder on a Grand Scale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The guy who helmed the revamp of the zombie genre 28 Days Later is back and still in top form in Sunshine, the most dazzling and awe-inspiring movie I've seen this year and one that, like the zombie predecessor, ingeniously takes all the conventions and rules of the genre from similar space adventure movies (Solaris, Alien, Apollo 13, Armageddon) and transforms them into a whole that cannot be described as anything other than hauntingly beautiful.Our sun is dying, sending the Earth into an Ice Age, and humanity's last hope rests with the Icarus II, a ship that contains a bomb whose mass is equivalent to "about the size of Manhattan." Their mission? To travel to the sun to drop the bomb straight down into the dying star. As the name of their ship implies, there has already been an Icarus I, who made the exact same attempt, but did not succeed, and were never heard from again. The movie begins about 14 months into the Icarus II's mission, when cabin fever is starting to run high and the crew begins to grate on each other's nerves. Sure, this may sound like the typical "a bunch of people trapped in a confined space go crazy" scenario, but it's more than that because aside from a mistake or two, the crew keeps their level heads and they actually remain reasonable throughout, and their insanity feels real because the claustrophobia is felt by the audience too. Through frequent sweeping camera shots of the ship as it approaches the sun, we feel the intense pressure of space pressing down upon us and the crew, so them breaking out into a fight once in awhile is completely believable.Psycho and physiological time bombs are planted early on, so that developments later don't seem tacked on as cheap or unnecessary. Most every development in the movie is a believable occurrence, giving us the feel that this kind of thing actually could happen. When a crew member openly admits that he made a mistake, it only further infuses the celluloid with the gripping realism that makes Sunshine so powerful. In Sunshine, both Danny Boyle and the entire cast gives us stellar (no pun intended) performances from beginning to end. They strike the perfect balance of seriousness and self-awareness. And because of this perfect balance, never does this film come off as if all the characters act like typical horror-everything-that-can-go-wrong-will people. They are smart, sure, and savvy, and the goof-ups are always believable, never really tacked on. The entire cast, from the always captivating Cillian Murphy, to the reliably brilliant Michelle Yeoh, even the human torch from the cheesy Fantastic Four, Chris Evans, gives us believable and strikingly amazing performances. In the final forty or fifty minutes of the movie, as everything begins to go wrong, these people hold their humanity strikingly well and their pain and psychological trauma is only that much more heartbreaking.The special effects in this movie are also nothing to sniff at. The sheer awesome power of the sun pulses through every frame, frying and vaporizing my expectations to mere ashes. I came into this movie expecting a sci-fi spectacle of grand proportions, but nothing could have prepared me for how well-done and accomplished the special effects are. A less talented director would have unimaginatively treated the sun as a mere destination point, but with Boyle at the wheel, it becomes a mighty God of a thing, with a will, purpose, and fiery determination. A couple of the characters even have a special kind of awe and respect for the sun that mirrored my own awe and respect for the movie itself. Because of the ingenious way of how the sun is set up, it never comes off as a cheap effect or a "oh great here's another shot of the sun." Boyle lovingly sets up every frame and majestically sweeps his camera through space to capture the intense and fiery beauty of the dying star. A couple of special effects shots almost had me crying because they were so vast and spectacular, even frightening. Boyle doesn't make the mistake of setting up the sun in a too personal way. There is never even a question that this sun will kill you without a second thought, which only makes the solar waves pounding toward two of the crew members on top of the space ship more terrifying and exhilarating. These words on this internet page can't even come close to describing the wonder and awe to behold that are the special effects, and they only get more wonderful and spectacular as the film goes along.The music for this movie is also wonderfully appropriate. It carries you along on this solitary doomed mission through space, effortlessly haunting the screen with echoing notes of creepiness, solitude, horror, awe, and wonder. Each pitch is perfect, each note is breathtaking, each melody is haunting.The best movies I've seen this summer are Ratatouille and The Bourne Ultimatum, and Sunshine has now been added to that list, maybe even surpassing the Bourne flick. It's just such a magnificent space opera of epic proportions that even though it may contain elements that we've seen in movies for the past twenty years, that doesn't meant that it's not good. As I mentioned at the beginning of the review, Boyle has done with space epics what he did with zombie films ? taken everything that we know and love (and maybe sometimes hate) about the genre, and morphed it into a beautifully woven tapestry that captures the real core essence of all the previous films while transforming it into something entirely new. Sunshine dazzles with its spectacular brilliance, real-life characters, haunting atmosphere, and creepy music, and its pure vision will have you wanting to see it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Ethereal Event - A Must Watch For Sci-Fi Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the most believable sci-fi flick I've watched in years. A Japanese commander with a B-list (Almost A) group of actors meshed with a seemingly well researched script makes for captivating realism.I was particularly impressed by the attention to detail. From the crews living quarters, to their experiences in the depths of space, no stone was left unturned.The end of the movie is quite closely related to 'Event Horizon', switching from Sci-Fi to Horror. Sunshine wasn't too well done at the end, but all in all the complete movie was fantastic - after all nothing can be completely perfect. A great first space movie for Boyle - 10/10!(Looking forward to 28 months later!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Icarus I was self-sabotaged. The crew decided it was best not to intervene into something that was beyond them. For a universe so indifferent to human life (as was demonstrated throughout the movie) it was only arrogance that gave Icarus I its mission. So minus Pinbacker, the rest of the crew huddle together in humility of the Sun, to the universe, demonstrating how fragile and how unimportant human life is to an unknown, but very natural process. It is clear that Pinbacker had the resources to survive for 7 years. And so with the arrival of Icarus II, what else would Pinbacker do but sabotage the mission? And what is the most practical way to do so? He sabotages the computer system. and grabs the most efficient weapon on board to make sure the rest of the crew can't fix it. What slasher film do the questions of human existence-come into play? The film pits the question of science (human agency) over religion (fate). The film is obviously influenced by "2001" "Solaris" "Alien" and "Apocalypse Now" But it does it better. The film is paced slowly like "2001" and "Solaris"--yet it doesn't relish simply in its self- assured "seriousness." You are gripped the entire way through. And like Apocalypse Now, Pinbacker goes crazy like Brando. Why Pinbacker is better is because he's much more coherent, much more purposeful, and not just masturbating in method acting. I think the premise of the film allows it to be placed alongside the canon of science fiction. Sunshine's scope makes it something quite significant. A film that will be underrated for quite some time "Nothing Survives. Not your Parents. Not your Children. Not even the Stars."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking over various reviews to "Sunshine," I saw many of them referenced "Alien" as a similar movie. I would make it more akin to "2001," where a crew ventures out into the solar system and gets more than they bargained for. "Sunshine" certainly does have a horror element, but that is only a small part of the film, and there is much more focus on human concerns like survival and leadership.But in addition to those adventure elements, there is also a sense of wonder and mystery: everyone on Icarus II seems attracted to the ball of gas called the sun, and the light it produces is akin to a narcotic. And since the sun is the giver of life for our planet, there is a spiritual side to the ship's mission, a characteristic of Danny Boyle's movies. We do see one negative aspect of religion (the insane fundamentalist), but we are given some hint of something beyond life (the wall of fire scene toward the end)."Sunshine" is an example of a space movie we should see more of. It's hard to make a good space flick that is not already part of a profitable franchise, but as this movie shows, with a good script and a good director it is very possible. This movie also features the most exotic space locale of our solar system, the Sun, which I cannot recall ever being the focus of a space adventure. This makes for some spectacular visuals, such as the rapid sunrise on Icarus II's shield and the final descent onto the surface of the sun. The visual effects are astounding, especially for a movie that was made for only $50 million.There are fine performances all around: Cliff Curtis, Cillian Murphy, Michelle Yeoh, etc. One qualm is that there are predictable crew-tension-moments, but this is a small complaint in comparison to the quality of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like science fiction so I went into this film expecting to me, at the very least, interested. Well, I got that and more. This film is pretty amazing, from the top-notch casting to the intelligent (and sometimes violently scary) storyline. What I really liked was how well presented the arguments the characters gave for why they chose to do what they did...in other words, no one came across as a completely insane villain (on the Icarus 2, anyway). They didn't need gratuitous nudity or superfluous back stories to make this a decent story...it was character and plot driven, just like the older films of the 40s were. Cillian Murphy,Rose Byrne and Michelle Yeoh were fantastic and believable in their roles, just as the rest of the entire cast was, but a real standout for me was Chris Evans as Mace. I've seen him play the amusingly goof ball role of Johnny Storm in Fantastic Four but he really showed his acting chops here. Suffice it to say, this flick has it all: great storyline, acting, special effects, etc. It would be a shame to miss this one on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but Worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A previous review by Grandma Death puts it more beautifully than I ever could so I will use a Spoiler to add to what has already been said. Indeed Sunshine boasts "a decidedly un-starry, but talented cast" which one of the main reasons Sunshine succeeds.*minor spoiler* I would add that a strength of Boyle's film is the editing, especially the microsecond subliminal flashes that occur at during the rendezvous. The sound design is also good, but not being an expert I cannot tell you exactly why.*SPOILER AHEAD* It appears I am not the only one who thought the main flaw of Sunshine was the Icarus I captain. His character was more monster than human, detracting from the otherwise realistic and non-clichéd human interactions portrayed. I would have much preferred to see a tormented soul than the one-dimensional horror film Boss. A more complex character could have been achieved with the same end-result of the film and would have also enhanced the philosophical themes while only extending the length of Sunshine by a small and worthwhile bit.Other than that I enjoyed Sunshine for many reasons: the special effects, the sound, the actors, the mood, and the unique approach Boyle brought to the SciFi genre. The first half or more of the film offers insight into group psychology and team dynamics too.Pros: refreshing addition to the genre; actors &amp; acting; casting; exploration of leadership styles and group psychology; audio &amp; visual effects Cons: read spoiler material above.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...on my shoulders makes me happy....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not to say this film made me overly happy; it did however, with effects and sound blaring, keep me entertained. Danny Boyle's take on science-fiction turned out quite well; as a crew of eight scientists and physicists embark on a last ditch effort to reignite the sun with a Manhattan-sized bomb on its back. The mission, as each crew member understands, is to ensure the bomb is delivered at all costs, and if everything goes as planned, return home in a couple years. But you already know this isn't going to happen, and that much peril lies ahead. It's hard not to mention the similarity SUNSHINE shares with the sci-fi/horror film EVENT HORIZON, and as is such, the film becomes a little convoluted towards the climax...but they aren't the same movie, not even close, and Boyle manages to keep the action and drama to searing degrees. The acting was especially good by everybody involved, and Johnny Storm proved to me he is quite the actor when given the opportunity. The music was interesting, not great, but it worked very well at times; giving the film some extra tension when the dark, or the light for that matter, just wasn't enough. SUNSHINE was tense but not scary; smart but not genius; and good, not great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When he chooses for us to die, it is not our place to challenge God?Sunshine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boyle's newest film Sunshine just enhances his oeuvre even more, bringing out, what in my opinion is, his finest achievement to date. This sci-fi thriller is equal parts 2001's psychological quandary, Event Horizon's supernatural foreboding, (although not as integral to the final act as some detractors of the film say it is), and Sphere's stir crazy cabin fever? with a little Armageddon bomb in space world saving. Sunshine is a feat in technological expertise, sci-fi rhetoric, visual beauty, and an acting clinic from its ensemble cast of actors better known for supporting roles in the past.Writer Alex Garland has crafted a story pitting man vs. God/science vs. creation. While I agree with this point as many have discussed, I don't agree with the simplicity of it. People have been pointing out that this is a tale of Atheism since how can we mortals take our lives in our own hands by using science to resurrect the sun? If God has called time on our existence, wouldn't it be our utter disregard for his own being to decide to go against his will? I refuse to believe the film is as simple as that because of all that is shown through its duration. For one, if we are to accept Greek mythology, it was Prometheus who gave us fire against the will of Zeus and to his own demise of infinite torture at the hands of vultures. The Gods have been fighting as far as how to handle us humans and if they had to take sides to fight for our survival, can't we always fight against those Gods that have said our time is up? Also, if God created us with the mental capacity to create science and ways to go against nature, isn't it his will to rise up to his challenge and fight?We are given many moments of religious epiphany as well, at the hands of the Icarus II's crew. These are the men and women risking their lives to save Earth and make a new star within our dying lifesource. Therefore they are supposed to be the atheists blatantly disregarding the clock of our existence's final chime. By looking at the sun through their ship's observation deck they are putting themselves one step closer to that God which they believe in. The sun's rays, which bath the deck with light and encompass those watching, become a shower of God's love and mesmerize those sitting before it. However, while this is true for people like Searle, the ship's psychiatrist, and Kaneda, the ship's captain, it is not for Icarus I's captain Pinbacker. While watching the video logs of their predecessor's mission's demise, we find that the old captain had an epiphany of God's will and decided to allow the sun's rays to consume them and turn them back into the dust from whence they came. The power held inside the sun is both life and death depending on one's deepest beliefs. What is killing humanity and putting them into nuclear winter is also the only hope they have left for survival.The story is, for lack of another word, simple at its core. While the sun dies, so does life on Earth. After a failed attempt to create a new star with physicist Capa's stellar bomb, he and a new crew mine the Earth of its final resources to construct one last bomb to do the job. They take flight on the two-year journey to the sun in order to drop the payload and fly back home hoping the bomb works and creates a new sun. The actual plot then, is the final leg of the journey to the sun and their attempts to succeed with the mission while also surviving themselves to see what their bravery has wrought. It is only when they discover the Icarus I on their way do they begin to question morality and the sacrifices needed to save millions at the cost of a handful. Through it all, Boyle infuses a wonderful visual artistry to counter the heavy struggle between crewmembers and the thoughts within themselves. The use of light is astonishing as the screen is filled with lens flares, double exposures, motion blurs, stark chiaroscuro contrasts between dark and light, and the use of transparent glass to show people as reflections and also layered through the fields of light. However he created the sun, Mercury, and the spark that will hopefully create a new star, is amazing to behold. The sun is literally God-like in is construction and composition and plays perfectly into the meaning that he and Garland wanted to express.Being a psychological thriller, though, means that superb acting is necessary for us to care for these people and accept their motives. This cast does not disappoint at all. Cillian Murphy is great as usual, familiar faces Rose Byrne, Michelle Yeoh, and Troy Garity are all realistic as too, but it is the others that surprise with their emotional work. Hiroyuki Sanada portrays strength and poise of character with his stoic face, Benedict Wong is devastating as the mathematician they all need to depend on, and Chris Evans is the real discovery, showing us how good he can be. While doing films like The Fantastic Four, Evans is usually the cocky funny man with one-note performances, not here though. His character is the one that understands the severity of their situation and is able to make the tough decisions for the success of the mission, no matter what the outcome of his own life. It is his mentality of self- sacrifice, at the cost of his own huge ego, that really shows what the film is about. Accepting your own death for the life of an entire world shows the strength of your being, whether or not you need God to get you to that point or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunshine is incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is quite simply one of the best science fiction films made in recent years. The Fountain comes to mind for many, I'm sure... but depending on your interpretation of the film, you may not see it as science fiction. I don't. So it is out of the running. Soderbergh's Solaris is another. A film about individuality and emotional development when faced with the solitude of eternity... it's a great film... but it doesn't have the science fiction feeling to it. Soderbergh described his film as Last Tango in Paris meets 2001. It's a pretty good description.Sunshine is an adventure. It is about the battle of logic vs. emotion and it is very intelligent. It is about power vs. sacrifice. It is about hope. It is about reality.The film is very skillfully structured. It starts off at the appropriate pace to allow us to really grasp the different feelings on the space ship. From the obsession of the sun... which itself is sort of a matriarchal Freudian obsession... being so close to the source of all life would likely drive people to stare and be fascinated, much like people do with the sea. The ship has a sitting room where the computer allows in 2% of the sun's light so that they can see it. This is not for study or anything of that nature, this is just for admiration. One character reasons with the computer and the computer says she will admit 3.1% in for a few seconds and that should not cause damage to the character's retinas. This sight might hold a religious quality for many. People worshiped the sun for thousands of years. It was a God that they could see. Before development of more complex religions, it is only natural that such a sight might hold the same primitive comfort our ancestors may have felt.I don't want to go into the story too much... or for that matter, anything past the first twenty minutes. The plot, known to those who have seen the trailer, is about the death of our sun. Not through it's own life coming to an end but due to a particle (currently theoretical) known as a Q-Ball - a super-symmetric nucleus, left over from the big bang - that is disrupting the normal matter. (Source: IMDb). And based on the trailer, you know that a return trip is not necessarily guaranteed. Now some may say that God decides when it's our time to go while others might say it's up to us to take care of ourselves. Instinctively, no matter who you are, you will shift towards the latter in a time of crisis. As living creatures, self preservation is our primal instinct. We won't let the sun die without a fight. BUT, if saving the rest of us may cost a few lives... a few astronauts and scientists... how can we not expect them, when faced with the reality that they may have to sacrifice themselves for the mission... how can we not expect them to decide that self-preservation is necessary to them as well? This film plays out beautifully. Even if you sit there with the thoughts you have during other sci-fi movies like the "why didn't he just..." or the "Nooo, what a dumb mistake"... you still feel the weight and the responsibility that the characters put into their decisions and you don't feel as if they're deliberately screwing up. It's a gamble. Cillian Murphy phrases it perfectly when asked to bring logic to a decision that he states is like asking him heads or tails.The film has opened on 10 screens this past Friday and it will expand to 400 this upcoming Friday. I URGE everyone to see it. From last summer filled with X3, Nacho Libre and The Break-up. From this summer to which the most anticipated films have mostly rendered mediocre approval from the audiences spending the hundreds of millions on them... we need to make it clear that we can't put up with so many years of *beep* coming our way from Hollywood. We want our films smart. We started with Knocked Up. Hopefully Hollywood will listen. We didn't see Fantastic Four 2 and Evan Almighty... HOPEFULLY... Hollywood will listen. We're going to see SUNSHINE. Hollywood WILL listen. Maybe we can bring back the integrity that went into film-making thirty years ago... or even eight years ago.See Sunshine. It's a science fiction masterpiece. It's a great film. It's an experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A creepy, artsy, and very provocative sci-fi thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After well over 500 reviews (and the probable thousands of films I saw before starting reviews) Sunshine gets the distinguished honor of being the first film I saw as a "limited screening." I had seen the preview once briefly and thought it look interesting enough and I happened to be in Toronto, Ontario and thought I'd check it out. I'm certainly glad I did. But it also raised the age old question in my mind of the difference between socially acceptable, critically acclaimed, artsy or just plain mainstream film because from where I sat Sunshine was far from an original concept. In fact in plot, and many different scenes, and deaths it reminded me so much of the critically trashed Armageddon (a film which I loved--see my review.) Now that might infuriate some spewing about how Danny Boyle is far more intelligent and artistic and more talented and better cast and blah blah blah but the similarities still exist along with comparisons with The Core, Deep Impact and so on and so forth. Where do the differences lie then? Well certainly Sunshine has a very intelligent dialog amongst the cast and the strange and often eerie psychological effects on the crew of the Icarus. Then you have the absolutely delicious and terrifying addition towards the end of the demented and twisted, and physically grotesque killer trying to wipe out the remaining survivors in order to stop their mission for his own twisted and confusing reasons. Boyle does not attempt to explain things and has this talent for instilling fear with flashes of faces of dead crew members and a nearly burnt alive naked killer that you never truly see but just in shots of blur and quick pans. It was definitely unique that he stuck by his decision to not fully show the killer and that made it all the more mysterious.The cast is terrific and very diversified. I think it might be one of the most diverse casts for a film of this type. Cliff Curtis (New Zealand born) who is really a terrific character actor I enjoyed most recently in his role as Bowman in Live Free or Die Hard (see my review.) In Sunshine he plays psychologist to the crew Searle. He seems to be the one in control for the most part and yet he shows this strange desire to discover something about what lies beyond the sun. He becomes fascinated with feeling and seeing the sun right up to his skin beginning to peel he has spent so much time in the "viewing room." Curtis definitely stands out in this film and does a terrific job. Cillian Murphy finally leaves his bad guy role behind and does a decent job as the smart and determined physicist Capa. Although in the beginning his character seems a little weak he definitely comes through and shows an unstoppable strength and this is one of the better roles I have seen Murphy in for certain. Chris Evans finally finds himself a serious role, and very good and it turns out it's still in space. Evans found success ironically as Johnny Storm in Fantastic 4 (both films) and in the hilariously bad Cellular but this role is better than both combined and then some. As Mace the hard hitting, and edgy pilot Evans really does a terrific job. He's more of an anti-hero than anything because despite his verbally abusive ways towards Murphy's character he never loses sight of the mission to save the earth. Although it's never said you can assume he has someone(s) back on earth that he will do anything to save. The supporting cast all round out the crew very well especially considering the cast is so small and have a very small setting to work with. The cast includes Michelle Yeoh, Hiroyuki Sanada, Rose Byrne, Benedict Wong and Troy Garity.Danny Boyle is not beyond doing this with a campy spin and in some ways Sunshine has exactly that in some respects. The poster outside the theater stated "A visual stunner" and the special effects in some ways are indeed stunning but everything in the film is very over blown, large bright, contrasting colors and ideas...the bright gold suits (self admittedly done on purpose by Doyle), the majestic creation that is Icarus and even the dying sun itself. Sunshine could indeed become a sci-fi cult classic and the best part is it had this feel of being far behind in it's time, like a retro film which is hard to truly nowadays with so much CGI and creations like that. I will argue with anyone who wants to tell me Sunnshine is even remotely original but nonetheless it's a gripping story. There are small things that you really find impressive such as the shots of the dying sun and mercury, the killer, the dusty relic of a ship they find, and even the end shots of a solar winter in Austrailia buried beneath the snow. The film definitely captures attention and will keep you very entertained. It's the best of several different genres and they the story easy and simplistic and easy to follow although I admit confusion to a few small parts in the film. Overall though Sci-Fi fans must see this and even if you just want a good story you won't be disappointed. The film is really terrific. Not entirely original but terrific. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prior to watching Sunlight, I wasn't sure what to expect, but ten minutes in... I found myself unable to deny my curiosity as the story began and I was thrusted into this new breed of science fiction.The plot.Mankind is in danger of freezing out on earth, the sun is cooling off, and this is the second of two missions in an attempt to "kick start" our star's core. 8 people, one ship, one last chance for human survival...The setting.The director did a great job making you feel like you were really "out there," stuck on this cramped yet incredibly massive ship speeding on a course to the center of our closest star "Sol." The sun itself had a presence that was undeniable, and was a constant theme behind all of the typical props you'd expect in a good science fiction. The style.A beautifully crafted film. The video editing and effects to emphasize moments of curiosity and tension added depth to this story nicely. Music and rich sound design created a good backdrop to the unknown as these characters followed the film into various moral and practical dilemma's. There were strong performances in each of the 9 total characters. They all had very distinct personality, talents that gave them purpose, and unique passions and perspectives concerning everything that happens in this movie. I was very entertained watching them interact from one crises to another. Watching how they'd deal with failure and stress. Other times I found myself captivated as most characters would eventually find themselves sharing a moment of clarity with "Sol" itself... Most of the time it was an intriguing combination of sound design and visual stimulation, but a good story with nothing "too" over the top kept it running strong right up to the very end, so the cool visuals and saucy sound only enriches this movie as it drives towered a "worth while" conclusion.There are a few surprises that could have hidden references, but I kind of like the mystery behind the issues and science addressed in this movie. It never really leaves the realm of the plausible, ultimately allowing the viewers to never once have to stand up and go "what the heck ever!"A must see for anyone who claims to appreciate movies in the spirit of Solarus, 2010, Event Horizon, The Astronaut's Wife, or perhaps the Mission to Mars or Red Planet films.It has a very real texture in it that grips you and really puts you into the mood. Good for a date or just a great ride at the theater. All and all... this is probably the coolest science fiction thriller I've seen since the Sci-Fi channel's Battlestar Galactica three hour pilot in 2003.Watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a hard time finding sci-fi space movies that I end up liking. This has been one of those that make the cut.Acting is really superb from all cast members, the plot was really well done, and perhaps most of all, I found myself having little trouble with my own "suspension of disbelief" - it all came off with realistic characters, plot, and suspense.This is not film that makes use of the usual space-insanity horror that infiltrates so many movies set in space, but there's just enough complete psychosis to throw a wrench in the smooth-sailing works. I don't want to write anything to give away the plot, but I would highly recommend this piece.I found myself likening the film to 2001 (gasp!) throughout the picture, but it's decidedly different for countless reasons - what makes it similar is a feeling I had of removal from the human race - the characters are all alone, their decisions will somehow impact the entirety of the human race, but the decisions they make and the point of action takes place in a kind of vacuum... it's eerie but lends an air of supreme significance to everything that happens during the film.Movie begins "in media res" - right at the initial point of action - so there's no long build up to the point of the story, it all comes across very clearly.Excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man or God?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, 28 Days Later) is back with the sci-fi thriller "Sunshine".In "Sunshine" Icarus Two is sent to the space to re-ignite the sun from fusing. Their mission is to finish the work what Icarus One started seven years earlier. First everything seems to go right but soon troubles will rise from the hot-red horizon...In real life the earths destiny will come couple of milliard years from now. The earth starts fading step by step only to shrunk and stop existing. But in "Sunshine" the threat of sun stop from shining is more acute. Despite this modification of inevitable and counted fact the movie is highly enjoyable. Boyle has focused attention on human behavior. How will a person change in space and what a long trip in outer-space does to a human-being? Also man playing God is one of the themes.Insignificant, Armageddon-like "we-are-the-saviours-of-the-universe"-bulging has been left a little lesser in the film so the psychological side arises to be the biggest point in "Sunshine". The cast is a little more unknown but a obvious star is Cillian Murphy (as Capa). He can perform a transvestite (Breakfast on Pluto) and a physicist (Sunshine) as believably. He is a true sight for sore eyes, too.If you fly too close to the sun you get easily burn. Like Icaros once.</fullReview>

The Icarus I captain was not able to accept the idea of running counter God's will, because man has not the right to do it, so he tries to dodge that the mission is carry out and doing this he becomes and makes flesh God manifestation; but is this that God wants, or in reality the Word is going to give us a possibility for saving us and repairing our mistakes? In fact, the movie also shows us our responsibility for Earth that we populate: we had created this annihilation, we must put right, and all the crew is conscious of this; but nobody is afraid to die and, like an award, death is a sort of self-fulfillment for everybody. The message that this movie sends us is not only "to lay down one's life for humanity", but also a way to awake to a problem and try to solve it before it will be late: better than a documentary, often too boring or too complicated to pay attention...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Would it be wrong to suggest that Danny Boyle is Britain's only current auteur? His latest film is a sci-fi-horror action/adventure (I'm sure there's a shed-load more sub-genre tie-ins) about a crew of seven sent out to re-invigorate a dying sun with a huge inter-stellar bomb. As is frequently the case, not everything goes according to plan, and it is never made clear whether any of our heroes will actually make it out alive. Combining the creepy paranoia of Alien, the semi-frenetic horror of Event Horizon and a little intelligent artiness of his own doing, Danny Boyle has created an old-fashioned B-movie with an overcoat of intelligence. Sunshine is the thinking man's Sci-Fi horror, an art film trapped in the body of mainstream blockbuster. You will come away equally curious about our own fate as you will royally thrilled by the blistering action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you have seen 2001, Solaris,Event Horizon Do not bother seeing "Sunshine"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>going in to watch this film, and being somewhat of a sucker for anything sci-fi I went in hoping for a film just half as good as what some of the reviews of "Sunshine", but after watching this flick, I'm undecided about it. I hate it, but yet i do not mind it. in this day a age of where global warming and general problems with the world itself it's a nice change to see something that affects us globally like a "dying Sun" and as far as the plot and storyline goes that's a bout all the originality you'll get from it everything else is ripped from various movies to make this 2001, Event Horizon, Solaris are a few films where "Sunshine" has picked to bits the story and formed this concoction, and its pretty bad, Character development and acting is yet-to-exist On an upside the music and score is Phenomenal, I adore it absolutely fantastic, and not that I have said it, it's the only high point of the film for me. Fans of Event Horizon, 2001 and Solaris will be somewhat disappointed at the fact that things like There is a talking computer, They find another ship and "all hell breaks loose", the 2001 I'm coming thru the airlock Hal sequence (also done in Event Horizon)Overall not as impressive as it was made out to be, nut never the less the move is not a bad way to speed an hour and a half. Mind you tho don't expect much. 5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie is gonna suck bad, but i was wrong. I felt good after watching it. Simply because of its modest presentation on the epic concept of saving mankind. The cast of characters are tragic yet you celebrate their heroism. whats good is that you actually care about them thanks to well-done acting performance by the cast.If you are thinking of going to watch it (and at any minimal chance loves science-fictions) then you really should because it is surprisingly done in a tasteful way (at least to me it did).The music used in this movie is very good, at times it just gives you a mix of threatening and soothing mood...Remember please don't try to compare it with big budget films like Armageddon because considering the low budget of this film its just not fair if you do.You should be warn earlier though that this movie is more of a science-fiction drama/thriller (yeah thats what i said "thriller") and at times this movie is slow-paced compare to other action-fiction movies but it delivers the story superbly and in the end you know its just worth it for you who understands. So watch it! watch it! watch it! because i like it! like it! like it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Us lucky Brits have gotten Sunshine a lot earlier then the U.S. (makes a change) and i just went to see it.Premise: 2057 - the sun is dieing, earth is frozen and the last chance for humanity is a crew of 8 attempting to deliver a bomb the size of Manhattan island to the sun to re-ignite it...easier said then done.Out of communication with earth the crew of the ship (Icarus II) get a transmission from Icarus I the spaceship sent to do the same job 7 years earlier that vanished without a trace...Thats where the sh*t hits the fan.First off Danny Boyle's amazingly intense direction does wonders with the sci-fi epic scale. The sun, the ships everything is done perfectly. The story is a perfectly enjoyable space yarn and the acting is pretty top-notch. The film especially shows that even 50 years in the future space travel is still probably the most hazardous thing you can do. Another nice surprise is that the film show people being real people, they fight, they get annoyed with each other, they make mistakes .etc, which is usually over looked in favour of some kind of space alien or something. The reason in my opinion that this film drops 2 stars is because of the very sudden change is tone during the last quarter of the movie.*Spoilers*After a crew member from the Icarus I that has somehow survived for 7 years manages to get on board the Icarus II, he decides to go all Jason on everybody and slashing people up...Never the less, the final few minutes are a nice ending and the visuals throughout the whole film are brilliant. My guess is that you will be glued to the screen for the first 65 mins, scratching your head for about 25 mins, then leaving the theatre thinking that was actually pretty damn good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful and well-produced picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hearing good reviews for this film I entered the cinema expecting on some level I would be disappointed. I wasn't. A hard to categorize film (action, drama, thriller, horror...) a sense of foreboding and isolation are quickly established which set the scene for both a well done action type move but also for a thriller and psychological suspense type film that together leave you to watch breathlessly as things unfold. The thing that truly made it for me is that it went outside the square. It wasn't the typical "armagedon, spaceship in the future, quickly established hero and woman he loves, series of problems, people die, explosions, someone does heroic deed and saves the day" in fact the hero of the film is initially portrayed as scared out of his wits at doing some repairs on the outer surface of the ship, and it completely shy's away from the cheap romance aspect (for which I am eternally thankful), the people are relate-able and the gadgets and gizmo's are (in my mind) fairly realistic (another great aspect being that all important parts of machinery/gizmo's are established early in the film, so your not sitting there wondering "why are they so desperate to push that button? Helga? Who's Helga?" and the characters are in the end, very human which is becomes so interesting because it's the realisation that all the different parts of what being human are, can be just as great an object as any physical obstacle. You wait in anxious hope that these one of the people can rise above human madness and can do what is needed to be done in the face of anarchy... In the end it does what it is meant to do, it is there to take you on a ride and it does so, every compelling minute of the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was for me a really bright spark in what appears to be a black void of a genre, i hope it has in fact sent shockwaves to the core of the industry and re-ignited some interest in making films that really do what they say on the box.Sunshine has a fantastic plot and !dare i say it! a absolutely brilliant cast, sure some people have said that certain cast members spoil it and can't act, but everyone IS a critic and at the end of the day, those kids are the ones taking home the big bucks, fair play to them.I got the same feeling watching this film as i did when i first saw The Abyss when i was about 10 or 11 years old. The story really gripped me and it kept me glued to my seat for all the right reasons, which to be honest about, was not something i was expecting to happen when i heard a friend say it was a 'bit like Armageddon'.Go see it, i am sure you will like!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't watch science fiction movie. They just don't interest me. But for Sunshine, I made the exception, because of the many good actors and the gripping trailer. Well, it was worth it.The story keeps you on the edge of your seat. Sunshine is not necessarily a scary movie, but the mood set from the beginning and onwards, is so tense you can't help but get sucked into the storyline. A good example of this is when the crew enters the Icarus I, and you see flashes of images as they look around the ship. The scientific explanations might not be correct, but it really doesn't matter, because this is not only scifi, but also a thriller.The acting in Sunshine was very good, too. Sunshine has an international cast, with some very good names in it, like Michelle Yeoh, Hiroyuki Sanada, Cillian Murphy, and so on. You feel for the characters from the beginning, and the tensions between them are brought to screen very well, especially between Capa and Mace. You really feel for characters as Trey, played by Benedict Wong, when he makes a mistake that endangers the whole mission.The cinematography is nice as well, the images are beautiful to look at, the spaceship is very well-made. It only helps to bring the story closer to you. The music had some great moments, especially the music of the ending sequence.But the ending sequence is also the reason why I rated Sunshine only 9/10. It's a bit of a disappointment, an anti-climax, although it starts of very powerful, including some flash-backs of earlier in the mission. The music adds to the effect as well, but at the real end, you leave the cinema feeling like the movie wasn't complete.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To all of you rating it 1 out of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Again I step up to give this movie a perfect 10 only because there are so many people giving it 1 star. After all the effort , money and thinking put into this movie it does not deserve 1 star. You simply cannot give it 1 star. Even the worst movies ever made on IMDb get at least 1.5 stars. I cannot take people seriously with their reviews if they give it 1 star. Why even bother writing? I read a few and they all have really bad and repetitive things to say. You could say my review specifically targets you haters out there. I noticed there are a few reasons that everyone points out : 1. science of the movie was bad 2. movie was against religion 3. ending was stupid Okay I did some research turns out the premise of the movie is fair to say the least. A phenomena called Q-ball infection can indeed cause the sun or any other matter for that sort to turn into dark matter effectively giving the impression the sun is dimming down. Eventually will end up being dark matter and no longer visible. I am not sure but I think gravity may stay the same or increase. The idea of the movie is create a bomb that makes Q- balls naturally decay in a chain reaction. This bomb the size of Manhattan requires a lot of materials which indeed only a few can be made with the materials found on earth. ** spoiler alert ** The secondary premise of the movie was god vs science. The original story was you the scientists meet god on the mission . Being close to the sun was being closest to God they have ever been. However I think Danny Boyle changed that for extra climatic effect. And I think this is where everyone's beef comes from. The ending of the movie is purely speculative from science or art department so the director and writer decided to make it their own interpretation. NASA uses artists interpretations all the time to think about how far away planets might look like. Or old movies had ideas about how Mars or Venus looks like. Is fair to say the ending is simply an artist rendering of being close to the speed of light and time being stretched to infinity. In fact from the perspective of Cappa that moment never ends. Since he is inside the falling cube time inside appears to be normal until is close to sped of light when we don't know. Nobody knows. Nobody has fallen at the speed of light to see what happens. Again, purely speculative. I would not give it 1 star just cause nobody knows what happens if you fall at the speed of light. For extra effect he appears to be touching the sun. From out perspective he will instantly vanish and explode. From his perspective the sun will take forever to burn him. **spoiler ending **All in all I'd say this movie was great accurate enough scientifically and entertaining enough to give it at least 7, 7.5, 8 our of 10 NOT 1 star. Come on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating science fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once in a while, a movie like "Sunshine" shows me something I haven't seen before. No, I am not talking about a new idea, or an "original" concept. I am talking about a new way in handling the focus and presentation. Most science fiction films will try to amaze you with fancy technology, creepy aliens, pulse pounding laser fights, and scripts that can leave a 15 year old middles class suburban emo scratching his head in contemplation on how such bad writing could ever be taken seriously.On a quick side note, the science was done very nicely. Even though some of it was pure speculation (who really knows what would happen shooting a bomb into the sun's core), it held up as very believable to me.Focus The focus of this film was on humans, and their relationship to the universe we live in. Sunshine begins showing us the crew and establishes their characters extremely well giving us a look at real people. There are no heroes here. There are no villains (except for "you know who", who was my least favorite part of this movie). They are real people. Each has their own color they live with in the movie. Corazon had her oxygen farm, Cassie had her will, I could go on and be more specific (and I really would like to talk about it) but I wouldn't spoil this rich movie experience for anything.Presentation Simply put, the music and visuals were handled in a way that was just beautiful. Instead of space, the sun, the planets, or anything else simply being there for the sake of moving the story on; it became the story absorbing the characters into themselves. Instead of man vs. nature, it became a beautiful audio and visual stimulation that could sweep a viewer away. I loved this movie, except for that one "thing" that everyone seems to be critical about (no spoilers!). However, the way in which that one "thing" was handled visually was a way I hadn't seen before. The inability for anyone to see it clearly was, in my mind, very creative. Even the one thing I didn't like about the movie was handled in an interesting way. In conclusion, I would like to say that this movie should appeal to those who like movies that are character driven, believable science fiction, artistic cinematography, and a lack of popcorn flick feel, this movie is worth the time and money to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful movie that wasn't advertised well. (This review contains minor spoilers, no plot outlines etc.)There are certain irregularities in this movie, which I won't spoil, but it's forgivable. I would highly recommend that you watch it. There is a lot of depth and human-ness to the characters, but I wish it were explored a bit more.The special effects are appropriate, and beautiful--this is what adds the icing on the cake. It's about humanities struggle for self preservation, and their weakness when it comes to self sacrifice. What I've learnt from this movie is that if you're building a spaceship, don't build ridiculously long swing arms that house your life support, outside the reach of your shields. And most importantly, give your crew a thorough psychological screen! I mean, some people are crazy...but I guess if you're sending people on a mission like this, you've got to take who you can get.I give it a 9...but realistically more like an 8.5 because of some missing logical connections. I wished the characters were explored a bit more. Bottom line; the acting is well done. The special effects are cool. The story is great, except for some tiny logical connections that were missing...but I won't go into detail here. Go see it. I'm pretty sure you'll like it.</fullReview>

It contains all the elements to a perfect movie: Suspense, Great Acting, Great Plot Structure, Incredible Acting, Breathtaking Effects, and some Comedy. Don't have anyone tell you what it's about though because the shock of it is incredible. If you are a Danny Boyle fan then you will not be disappointed. The acting by Chris Evans and Clian Murphy were superb. There is definitely no movie like this and Danny Boyle is definitely the only one who can pull it off. I strongly suggest this to the fans of Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey. There are very few flaws to the plot and the actors never break out of character. I am looking forward to be amazed by Danny Boyle's next movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Staring at the Sun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh Mother Nature, why have you forsaken us? Are we really all that bad to you that we deserve what you're giving us? Not only have you fought back with global warming and disastrous storm activity but now you insist on dooming us on film as well. SUNSHINE, from director, Danny Boyle, does not announce distinctly when it takes place. Regardless of the time, the sun is about to give out on us. It has been slowly dying over the centuries and its warmth is finally waning on earth. After one unsuccessful attempt, the people have earth have pooled their resources together to send one last chance into space. The crew of Icarus II must travel through space for what can only be millions of miles (it may even be billions but I'm no space enthusiast) to reach the sun and drop a bomb into its center in hopes or reigniting its flame. Boyle's SUNSHINE is a visual hot bed that draws the viewer into its world of dichotomies. From light and dark to close and far, the opposing forces manifest on the screen to make for a gripping debate between whether it's better to fight against fate or resign yourself to it.Staring directly into the sun is damaging to your eyes while staring directly into Boyle's SUNSHINE will delight them. Boyle makes calculated visual and sound decisions that allow the viewer to feel like a crewmember on this momentous voyage. Long corridors are often devoid of noise and shown stretching on toward far depths before cutting to tight framing of various crewmembers (Cillian Murphy, Michelle Yeoh and Chris Evans, to name but a few). The rooms that find these solitary crewmembers vary in style from simulation rooms that show the glory of the sun's power to the payload room that houses the bomb that will hopefully save humanity, from rooms with wall-to-wall computer screens to oxygen rooms dedicated to the growth of plants. With so many rooms to speak of, Icarus II feels like its own world. With the people of this world alone in each of these rooms that make up this separate existence, the detachment from each other is only second in intensity to the distance between this ship and the planet it has left behind and lost all communication with. Determined to complete the mission they have set out for must outweigh the fear they feel being so completely secluded as their drive in order to survive.Author of THE BEACH, Alex Garland, has crafted a script that plays out like a morality debate. The importance of the individual is weighed against the significance of the masses in some moments, while the needs of the masses are then weighed against the natural progression of the species in others. Fate and the usual bickering over whether we have any say in the matter permeate the entire mission, mostly against Boyle's better judgment. Garland's exploration of God and atheism were not elements that Boyle wanted to devote much screen time to, if any, but they still manage to make their way to the forefront. It seems curious to me that he would want to avoid these topics, as SUNSHINE needs them to further enforce its own sense of urgency. If this mission is unsuccessful, the sun's warmth will inevitably cease to reach the earth. Come the time when all of earth's inhabitants begin to reach their freezing point, the existence of God is going to be the hottest topic around.SUNSHINE will definitely draw comparison to Stanley Kubrick's 2001 (it's doing it right now even) with its soft-spoken computer voice commanding the ship and eerie, quiet emptiness. While it won't come anywhere near having the same impact, it is still a strong successor. Boyle modernizes the space solitude tale by jumping back and forth between quiet calm and frenetic dizziness, between dusty and stale and bright and explosive. As the mission wreaks havoc on the minds of the crew, Boyle plays with our senses, making SUNSHINE an engaging, tense and thought-provoking trip to the center of the sun. Really though, can you imagine it any other way?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunshine is a great film about a crew of eight sent to the sun in the distant future to jump start the sun. It contains great acting lead by Cillian Murphy and Rose Byrne, with good acting by Chris Evans. With a great script and good directing the Sci- Fi genre has been brought back. Cool quotes like when the former captain of the icarus 1 says ' I talked to God for 7 years. He told me to take us all to heaven", and "So if you look up and it is a particularly beautiful day. We might have made it", gets you thinking. It really didn't look like a Sci-Fi movie until the former captain came back as some sort of flame person, and started to kill the people, but you have to realize that we will never be able to go to the sun or anywhere near it, that is good sci-fi. With hints of the movie The Abyss( top 10), Sunshine is one of my favorite films in a while.</fullReview>

Like a lament on mankind's fate, a melancholy sadness permeates the air as we get into the characters, perfectly punctuated by dramatic stabs.An intelligent stunner of a ride, with breathtaking scenery and technique, and the increasing tension at breaking point.

		<shortDescription>A brilliantly sculpted piece of insight into the human mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been highly anticipating Sunshine for a very long time indeed, seeming to be a 'better' Event Horizon and Armageddon mixed together. When describing its premise to others it did seem silly and not worthy or my anticipation- launching a gigantic nuclear bomb into the sun? But then I add that it's directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland, something not to be dismissed considering the last collaboration on 28 Days Later and its huge success. Sunshine was billed as Boyle's answer to the science fiction genre, and it is. The science behind the movie (the dark matter reversing nuclear fusion) comes across as plausible despite the only remedy being a massive nuclear bomb, and it is this 'realism' that makes the film so captivating along with the depth and vulnerability that comes with each of the characters when faced with such an epic mission. To launch a nuclear warhead into the sun, the source of all life on Earth, must be a gargantuan task in itself, and the plot and scrip readily take this into account, using it to great success. Trey's mental breakdown after his near destruction of the mission and his ultimate fate are moving and understandable. Others would question his ability to make such a mistake in the first place, but when taken into the context that he is only human, doing all those calculations on his own in the face of the sun cannot be by any means be a simple task. Similarly the horror aspect of the movie, is also understandable and not a disaster as other would deem. It is a man who has completely lost his mind, but he's lost it trying to head the most important mission in the history of mankind trying to save the most important component of all life on Earth. So rather than just bill it as a science fiction movie that turns into a horror slasher movie, Sunshine is a brilliant, moving and utterly enthralling insight into the human mind under severe pressure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have given this movie a 4, mostly because of the special effects.As a science fiction fan I understand the need to "suspend ones disbelief", which you need to do with the whole kick start the sun with a nuke idea. However there are a number of flaws in the stories science which I disagree with, namely the fallacy that if you jump into space without a suit, you will a) immediately start to expand/ explode a la "Total recall" and b) freeze. Firstly you wont expand/explode if you breathe out, sure the nitrogen in your blood will start to bubble but thats about it. Secondly space is a vacuum its not cold or hot, just ask NASA, one of their biggest problems is waste heat. If space was that cold why did they need a coolant tank for the main frame? You could just as easily stuck it on the outside of the space craft.They entered a "no com" zone, this is easily fixed by having a communications satellite above the elliptic. The whirly coms mast wasn't needed and in fact would have added to the maintenance load of the crew for no good purpose, the equipment could easily have been stuck to the side of the ship.I will get off my horse now and refer readers to Arthur C Clarke and Stanley Kubrik (2001) and keep hoping that the producers of this type of movie will actually talk to scientists, engineers and published science fiction writers about what you can and cant do in this reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget about science and logic! Like many other Science fiction movies this is about using your imagination! Great scenery,beautiful special effects,possible future! So far so good! The story however was quite uneven and predictable! It seemed to be a mix of "Event Horizon","Armageddon" and "The Core" but without their emotional impact! The cast was quite good! I liked it that they also used some well known Asian actors like Michelle Yeoh and Sanada! The problem is that we don't really get to know the characters! There is no introduction about who the characters are and what their function is! (Yes,gradually we learn about their specialty's!) But more importantly, we never learn what the group dynamics are! (what are the relations between the team members? Who do the members like or dislike?) Without this knowledge it is impossible for us to care about the characters! I mean the fact that they are chosen for this mission to save Earth is quite heroic! Wouldn't it make more sense to at least show more drama about this noble task! "Sunshine" is quite intense but never gets really thrilling because of the predictable story! I was hoping for some wonderful twist in the end that would make up the flaws in the story! Sadly there is no surprising twist! Which is a real shame! Overall "Sunshine" is entertaining but pales in comparison to Danny Boyle's previous work!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhere in the near future Earth is facing a big challenge: the Sun is fading out. In an attempt to save the planet and itself the human race sends out a huge space ship with an even bigger nuclear charge on board to start up the Sun again. So far so good. Typical some more or less far-fetched background story for a disaster film like any of the ones that have been in the cinema the last decade: Armageddon, Deep Impact, The Day After Tomorrow to name a few.Sunshine isn't very different from all these other disaster films. The main difference is that this one doesn't thrive on the effects of disaster on Earth itself, but instead thrives on disaster on the spaceship. And given the trip to the Sun takes -very- long there's a good chance of that happening. Overall I couldn't be entirely phased with the film. It reminded me far too much of 2001: A Space Odyssey and had far too many moments where it made jumps that were just too weird to keep the film uniform.All in all, it does have some good sequences in it but far too much seems to be a copy of other films and a bad copy at that. A real shame - it did have quite a bit of potential to be something really good.3 out of 10 burned out astronauts</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The single worst film I've ever seen (sci-fi by numbers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of bad films in my time, but this is the only one which has made me laugh with genuine insanity. There is nothing remotely original about this film. If you want to see the alternative tedious films it's copying, see "armageddon" or "the core". Both myself and my family predicted the entire plot of the film after the first 1/2 hour. It would have been sooner, but NOTHING happened in the first 1/2 hour. I say watch this film, purely to laugh at it.Summary: Predictable plot, Poor characterisation, terrible directing (voices all at the wrong volume, music too loud, inability to form any bond with characters, etc.) poor writing and leaves many at the end asking what they just watched.Thanks Matt</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my all time most despised movie. Everything from the very opening shots to when I walked out after half time. I could not comprehend what the actors were saying, what was happening in the plot or why, what parts of the set were meant to be what, or which characters were meant to be what part of the plot. The cinematography was as incomprehensible as the script, with just a lot of excessive use of light and terrible angles and focus so that all was just a blur of flashes of mumbojumbogobbledygookishboloney, which would have had more meaning if the actors had all be omitted and the script torn up, leaving just a visionfest of bright lights, which I could have put to better use lying on a solarium. Danny Boyle And Alex Garland, you should both be sent to work in MacDonalds, as should most of the actors in this garbage. I Will never EVER pay to see another movie with these names credited again.

		<fullReview>Just about everything i hate about this movie has been said, the only thing that is left is the fact, who picked the crew in the first place? These characters were not even remotely believable in their so called chosen field nor remotely believable. Obviously in the future there are no psyche evaluations with the most important mission for the safety of humankind. I believe the plot revolved around the sanity of the crew and nothing else, how desperate were the powers that be, for them to pick this band of social misfits. Shocking movie, iamb only posting so i can try and get the total score of 7.3 down where it belongs 1 out of 10, i would vote less if i thought it could change the outcome of the vote. After saying what i have i believe the actors did as well as they could have given the calibre of the script, and the special effects were done very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Relegate to a Black Hole post-haste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems to me we have seen the best of Danny Boyle. "Shallow Grave" and "Trainspotting" were highly energetic movies, very comfortable in their milieu and made by a director who not only loved movies but had real narrative control as well. Since then, (and it now seems so long ago), Boyle has been all over the joint, and to his cost, (although I do have a sneaky affection for "A Life Less Ordinary", a mess but fun all the same while his TV movie "Vacuuming Completely Nude in Paradise" had some of the old "Trainspotting" energy and a terrific turn from Timothy Spall). You could hardly call "Sunshine" fun; a mess, certainly, but never fun. Near the end it turns into the kind of big, dumb monster movie redolent of the sci-fi films we used to know and love, ("The Thing from Another World"), but by then all the juice had been drained out of it and the visual pyrotechnics that admittedly had been so thrilling earlier in the film now seemed like overkill.Things might not have been so bad if Boyle had a decent script to work from but Alex Garland's lame attempt at a screenplay seems cobbled together from a conglomeration of sci-fi movie clichés; here a bit of "2001", there a bit of "Solaris", here a bit of "Alien", but to compare this with any of those or even with such highly imaginative, low-budget classics such as "This Island Earth" or "Dark Star" is just an insult. For a long time Boyle's movie is like watching very expensive paint dry then it kind of kicks in with a killer-on-board scenario, (dumb but with the potential for cheap thrills). Sadly said thrills never come. Boyle sees fit instead to flood the screen with dazzling images that detract from the action to such an extent that the action seems to lose coherence. It doesn't even provide the pleasures a decent slasher movie might.Once upon a time the crew on this kind of mission, (to the sun, no less), would have been made up of hardy Americans, (and maybe in the fifties the script might have got a dig in at the pesky Russkies). They would have been sharp pins as befitted their status as super scientists on a mission to save the planet. "Aliens" changed all that. 'Scientists' now were scuzzy types (from all nations) who you felt would have been more at home dealing drugs up some back alley. The scuzzy types in "Sunshine" are no exception. The men scrap, the women pout in t-shirts and the acting is lamer than a one-legged pirate. No-one comes out of this movie smelling of flowers, (at least none you might want to put on your shelf). Everyone involved, with the possible exception of the cinematographer, should strike this from their CV's post-haste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that this film is not one of my favourites.I had so much hope for it too. The trailer makes it sound so much better than it actually is. I enjoyed the Visual side of the film very much and the storyline is a good one. Watching the film did make me think of references to Alien. The claustrophobic nature of the ship in the huge landscape of space against something they had no power over- the sun and all that protected them from it was a shield, the distress signal which they chose to answer. The crew were doomed from the very beginning. However, the ending of the film was very disappointing in my opinion and was a huge anti-climax. The acting could have been better but there were elements of suspense made very clear. I wanted so much for the film to be one I would remember, but unfortunately it will be for the wrong reasons.</fullReview>

Unlike English directors working in America, Danny Boyle has remained this side of the pond with a fragile industry and has still pulled off a film that will silence the world with awe.Headed by an international cast the usual suspect Cillian Murphy, along with the human touch and Ojio from The Last Samurai you can expect plot twists, scares, visual and audible beauty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science fiction - minus the "science" and the "fiction"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie since it's been a long time since I last saw a good science fiction film. But I was disappointed.I was prepared to suspend my knowledge of science (most sci-fi films are pretty far-fetched - and this one is no exception) but it wasn't the science that let-down this film, it was the fiction (storyline). Because there wasn't any. None. Apart from the basic (and promising) premise of the film (earth cooling and the need to heat up the Sun by delivering a bomb) there was nothing else in this film. No character development. No plot beyond a couple of fatuous stories thrown-in to enliven the monotony of endless space shots.The mediocre science and non-existent storyline weren't the only problems. The acting varied from competent to amateurish, the direction was lacklustre, the movie was frequently over-powered by huge sound effects, and the pace varied from slow to very slow. The allusions to other great sci-fi movies (2001, Contact, Dark Star) just reminded me how poor this film is in comparison.It's not a terrible movie. Some of the cinematography was good. So if you really want to see it, watch it at the movies since on a small screen it really would have little to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science Abuse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premises for Sunrise are illusory so it's of to a bad start. The plot runs in an unnatural way, human interactions are not what you might call typical and the science is not feasible. For any mission to succeed there most be cooperation but we find very little here contrary to sacrifice which we find a lot and it's disturbing since the two are contradictory by nature."This is not a democracy!" ?That's an understatement, there is no obvious chain of command, like in most Hollywood movies individuality primes. Not a very big complement for a mission of such a monumental scale, one might add. Bad computer personality disorder present and for a change the computer talks in slang, they should have used leet; to be succinct it's not Arthur's C. Clarke HAL but it will do. Some of the crewman don't master English pronunciations very well let alone operate complex and ambiguous machinery, no Patrick Stewart in there but they'll have to do. The movie itself is tedious since the suspense is maintained with old school horror tactics, special effects and unfeasible conduct. The genre is supposed to be Science Fiction but in the end turns out to be suspense, horror and some Science Abuse. The rating is my only disappointment, but I presume that this is what people want. Long gone are the times when people appreciated something else beside wardrobe and makeup. Space traveling without a suit is my favorite part followed by diving in liquid oxygen and culminating with being chased by skinned indestructible, radiation resilient creatures. Sufficient to say that the movie it's full of cracks and holes, acting is mediocre and even horrible (Asian actors) it lacks the coalescent ingredient that makes a movie worthwhile. Danny Boyle should have stayed in the "Trainspotting" region where he did a wonderful job and leave space as a final frontier, where it belong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what I missed that everyone else saw in this movie. I usually trust IMDb's ratings, since they're made by people like me. However, on this movie, I have to strongly disagree.I was bored out of my mind for the first half. The characters cared deeply about things that were subsequently lost, and I found myself not caring at all. No basis was established for me to even care about the individuals. While they were crying, I was too...from extreme boredom. Sure, the movie was rampant with symbolism and things you had to derive, but all were pretty obvious and did nothing to put a break in the boredom.Then the movie became suddenly terrifying about 1.2 hours into it. I still didn't care much about the characters, so the deaths weren't really affecting me much. Plus, there was obviously very little money left over for the bad guy. You never saw his face (which some would say is creepier but undoubtedly makes the movie cheaper), and the guy holding the camera on him apparently had turrets.All in all, I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this one. Maybe wait until it comes out on DVD so you can fast forward through the first half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stumbles repeatedly and dismayingly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This potentially interesting story manages to trip itself up in all the ways that "28 Days Later" avoided, doing itself in by alternating glaringly unpersuasive plot points with heavy doses of pretentious pseudo-philosophy. It would appear that the demonstrably talented creative team simply got too ambitious and hence strayed too far from their native strengths. As a self-conscious homage to "2001," the story manages to be ponderous and gloomy, in spite of the fact that it was built around a plainly dopey premise that would have been more appropriate to a fast and noisy Michael-Bay treatment. Picture a cross between "The Core" and that remake of "Solaris" and you'll have some idea of the artistic effect. The equally awkward but intrinsically more mercenary "Mission to Mars" suffered from some similar flaws.At times the movie is painfully earnest; at other times it is blithely ridiculous. Yet whether the material being depicted at any given moment is silly or sublime, Boyle has handled it all as if it were deadly serious -- as if the fate of the world were truly at stake, and as if anyone in the audience who may have a few qualms at suspending their disbelief is simply not worth paying any consideration to.He should have had some more campy fun with the goof-ball premise, as was sporadically done in "28 Days Later." Instead, the effort to emulate Kubrick encases all the proceedings in gallons of embalming fluid, and the frustrating tale never develops any characteristic sense of energy or authenticity. A disappointment all through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SUNSHINE (2007) *** Cillian Murphy, Rose Byrne, Michelle Yeoh, Chris Evans, Cliff Curtis, Hiroyuki Sanada, Benedict Wong, Troy Garity, Mark Strong, (voice of Chipo Chung). Sci-fi amalgam of "2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY", "SOLARIS", "EVENT HORIZON", "ALIEN" and any other genre flick from the past 20 years could best describe this derivative yet fascinatingly entertaining film about an international team of astronauts and scientists hurtled into space to complete a mission impossible: drop off a megaton bomb into the sun, which sorely needs a reboot or else all life in the universe will be extinct. Heady, trippy and occasionally awe- inspiring visuals thanks to cinematographer Alwin H. Kuchler's Oscar-worthy skills and Mark Tildesley's excellent production design make up for the stilted dialogue provided by Alex Garland's screenplay. Filmmaker Danny Boyle provides the overall aesthetic superbly in spite of its all-too-familiar trappings, which get bogged down in the film's last reel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I so meant to enjoy this. Do you know the feeling? You hear about a movie, you think, wow, this is for me, then you go see it, and then ... well, nothing. I mean, Dannie Boyle! Alex "second only to Palahniuk" Garland! Read "Coma", and you'll know what I mean. And then you can't even tell the astronauts apart, not because the plot is complex or intricate in any way, but because all characters are totally flat and there's hardly any dialog to speak of. And when they talk, it's in some unrecognizable accent, sort of like "L'Auberge Espagnole" in space. Just a couple of James-Blunt-looking slackers hanging out in last season's American Apparel. This is one of a new, exceedingly boring breed of SF flicks where what little drama they have to offer is claimed rather than acted out. At the same time, it's a lesson on the power of props. All the glamor is in the gadgets. Like the vaguely ipod-ish communication thingies and the on-board mushroom lamps. Or the space suit. My money definitely is on the solar space suit. Okay, it's bulky and unflattering and seems to come in one size only, but the super-narrow visor slit and the golden trimmings will make sure you turn heads even in Las Vegas (dressing props: Colin Bayliss). But if you want sizzling sunlit action, there's no topping the blazing Crematoria sunrise in "The Chronicles of Riddick".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Again, Another Plagiaristic Boyle/Garland Tome...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not satisified with completely taking every action beat from John Wyndham's "Day Of The Triffids", adding Zombies, and calling it "28 Days Later", now the overinflated duo are back raping the sci-fi spaceship drama.Okay. First of all, dropping a bomb into the sun to prevent a cataclysm (which is never really shown anyway) was already done back in a 1990 movie called "Solar Crisis".However, we have a previous mission to do this that vanished, but suddenly turns up again ("Black Hole"/"Event Horizon"), with a distress beacon ("Alien"). Added to that numerous complications (liberally lifted-and-adapted from "2010"), a religious lunatic subplot ("Event Horizon"), a character "staring in bliss at the stellar anomaly" (the original "Solaris"), a "have to reenter the ship via explosive bolt decompression" scene ("2001"), yadda yadda yadda.It really is truly shocking. A bomb that has to be manually exploded by leaving a ship -- "Dark Star" -- wouldn't be quite so much of a lift, if the character in that movie wasn't called Pinback (the captain of the vanished ship in "Sunshine" is Pinbacker, and there's NO WAY IN HADES you can tell me that isn't an admission of guilt), and did his own little to-camera video-diaries. Tear-jerking denouement scenes that are so obviously modelled after "Armageddon".Despite that, after the teeth-grating first half, this movie has some beautifully shot and directed moments.It also has some of the dumbest logic, character idiocy, and roll-in-the-aisles laughing Hollywood Space Physics I've ever seen.Many of the actors are earnest and give their best. Oddly, Chris Evans (!?!?!) and Michelle Yeoh are the two standouts.Soderbergh's underrated "Solaris" is a far better movie.Okay, Alex and Danny. Off you go. You've raped that genre. Time for a war movie, or something. I'll look forward to seeing all the scenes in those movies being "revisited"...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mulling over some of the recent postings here I do have to contest you somewhat, yet there has to be a lot of acknowledgment as to the description of the overall composition of the movie and its use of well-worn cliché-like means of storytelling.What if, my dear pre-posters, what if, you were just a bit too staunchly expecting the expected, just oh so slightly skimming the waters and not considering to swim a decent while?What if thus you missed a significant point of story-telling, that being, again, like in so many movies and books, that the characters are intended to be portrayed in a clear-cut, simple, close to stereotypical way, thus enabling the audience to fill in, to readily or more readily accept the characters substituting for the individual audience member, moreover one's own multi-layered personality is given room to develop, the more archetypical traits of personality are thus discovered.And what if you allow the movie for the briefest of moments to be one of the ultimate quests for God and then inversely for one's self.We are presented with all the grandest and lowliest behaviour man might show and be subjected to when faced with himself, others and ultimately his concept of God, as ancient as it may be, and well it is ancient is it not?What was first and was all-influencing throughout the history of mankind, for better or for worse, what was it that triggered wars, made people bend their knee, what gives life and readily takes it when being exposed to it for an extended period of time?What is it that makes you content and happy on a summers day and alternately strikes you with fits of melancholy and depression if absent in winters time?In the end it may well be the moment of absolute proximity to the idea of divinity, this moment, this flicker of being in limbo, when Capa waits for the reignition of God or its closest representative.It does contest God and it doesn't.But what is truly contested is non-commitment. If we acknowledge that we live in society and do not commit us to it, if we only harvest those pastures of plenty and not commit us to them, if we solely live to exploit for the sake of the self and mitigate the rest then nothing now shall ever come to any good. But if we do commit us we might have another page to turn and there is a particularly beautiful day to live for. There is always hope as long as we do!So now, eventually, what if by a simple twist of fate you went to see the sun and forgot to bring your eyes?Go watch it again, and see it for what it might well be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sort of a shake and sun-bake of elements from "The Black Hole", "Alien", and even "Event Horizon". Excellent special effects, with a story that has a definite "been there done that" feel to it. Sadly, despite some good acting, the film never pays enough homage to the films it steals from, nor does it fly off into new fresh angles. The horror scenes that enter late in the film, are shot in a pretentiously "artsy" manner, (perhaps to conceal the fact that this basically is just a well-mounted, if extremely slow, horror film) which just serves to obscure exactly what fate is befalling some of the characters. People either forget or don't notice that in "28 Days Later" Boyle stole elements from "Day Of The Dead". Theft continues here, both in script and visuals, but its super serious tone allows no fun to be had with moments such as the one where the ship computer acknowledges there is an extra person on board. And by that point, the film has been so incredibly slow, any suspense that would normally be derived from such a revelation is non-existent. Boyle's knows how to put a film together and has a lot of talent. I just wish he'd stop trying to be "important" and "artful" and let out his fun side. But maybe, like the suspense in this heavy time taker, it doesn't exist.</fullReview>

Of course, there are a number of things that you will look at and say - hold on a second, that's not right..., like for example the absence of a backup computer. There are plot holes, but they can be tolerated.What cannot be tolerated is the cheap injection of horror/slashing at the end of the film. This was supposed to be a serious sci-fi movie, but instead it degrades into being a cheap slasher which I hated.In addition, it rips off other films such as Event Horizon and 2001, and even Star Trek. It's unoriginal, and the plot will leave you thinking "Can a film really be this bad?".Other than that, the visuals are OK. The casting is not that great (Capa, the only person who is an expert on the bomb on the ship looks like he's a 25 year old university graduate. The second-in-command looks like an army private. And all of them behave like teenagers throwing tantrums around and jeopardising their mission because of their petty moral concerns (which, when you look closely, aren't really big concerns at all).Not a good film, and the ending will make you feel your intelligence has been insulted. It's as if the writers could not think of a better way to kill them all, and so went for the "mad-man-slasher" effect.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow Entry Was My Problem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went with friends to see 'Sunshine' tonight! I didn't actually choose it myself, but i'm usually up for seeing most films! I thought the movie was alright but my main problem was that I was a bit bored by 10 minutes in and that kind of stuck in my head for the rest of the duration even though it did suddenly pick up when it got into the action! I'm not a huge sci-fi film fan- i'm more into horrors or comedies so maybe that was part of the problem! Anyway, i thought the visual was great, but the storyline was just a bit bland! It didn't have any twists or anything like i like films to have, and i personally felt the ending was a bit obvious, however visually impressive! The acting was good, but as a whole the film didn't do a hell of a lot for me! I rate films on whether i'd want to buy them and i'm not sure i would with this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened with the immense gravity of the sun?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the characters are walking on that space ship as if they were on earth. how could they maintain gravity when the power was off (when they went from Icarus II on Icarus)? how did the burnt up guy survived from the immense heat of the sun? how come they haven't encountered an meteor rain (the kind that Icarus I encountered). how come they were not falling straight into the sun an they were flying as if they were in a hot air balloon? being that close to the sun its gravity is much more stronger that one of a nearby planet (if there was one).the hydrogen reserves of the sun are enough for another 4 billion years. so far the the sun has used up half of its reserves and transformed them into helium through a process that is called nuclear fusion. fifty years from now the sun will be up there shining and heating the earth, just like it has been for the last 5 billion years. the question is what did they use in order to light up the sun again? the flashes of human faces were un-needed and nothing can lead you to the idea that they are the crew from Icarus I. all in all it is a mediocre movie, an unfortunate combination between SF genre an horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it with director Danny Boyle in that he just can't seem to finish a film? Early glories aside (Trainspotting and Shallow Grave) he starts well but ends so badly, this was the case with 'The Beach', '28 Days Later' and now 'Sunshine'. The first half of this film is amazing, visually stunning and so grippingly enjoyable that for the first time in ages the audience around me was scarily quiet. The story of eight astronauts flying a payload bomb the size of Manhattan island directly into our dying sun to save all of mankind is a bold and original idea from the pen of previous collaborator Alex Garland but I'm afraid that's all it is and between them they cant seem to get the mileage out of it. What starts with some breathtaking effects and raises some quite huge ethical and philosophical questions just turns into another sloppy sci-fi thriller. The first half contains some impressive shots allowing the viewer to not only grasp the size of the sun and the ship in which they are travelling (Icarus 2) but the enormity of the problem they face and the weight that these various experts carry on their shoulders. Its like 2001 on the exterior shots and any other future film in the endless silver corridors of the ships interior but the way its paced and the character development does have you sat on the edge of your seat as the story unfolds, then it all goes wrong, and I'm not just talking for the crew. From the moment that they find the Icarus 1, a previous attempt to carry out the same mission that failed seven years earlier, it just becomes preposterous, overblown and pretentiously arty. Here we step into the realms of 'Alien', 'Event Horizon' and 'Disney's The Black Hole' its all mood lighting, explosions, fire and brimstone. I don't want to say too much about the last hour of the film but let's just say it contains nearly every space disaster cliché I can think of. I for one was very disappointed especially because the opening was so grandiose. If Ewan McGregor ever forgives him and they can get a decent script from Irvine Welsh's book then maybe Trainspotting follow up 'Porno' will be the one that even Boyle cant mess up? But for now don't hold your breath.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing film from Danny Boyle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film last night. I was hoping for great things as I like Danny Boyle,but was sorely disappointed. There was absolutely no character development. I wasn't worried if one or all of them died. The music was too imposing, the dialogue, when you could actually hear it, was woeful and the acting was the same. All that was left was the CGI and 2001 ASO, despite being nearly 40 years old, was more realistic. It was an amalgam of other SciFi films such as Contact, The Thing, Silent Running, Event Horizon, 2001, etc.etc., all of which were better films. There are some Directors who just lose their touch when given too big a budget and I fear this is what has happened here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A much hyped SF film which badly disappointed by being, in itself, slow and, in a broader context, little more than derivative of the old 2001/Solaris genre. The story was based on an interesting, if implausible, idea but relied too much on computer graphics to make up for thin plot. Having hung in there waiting for something unpredictable to happen, I felt really annoyed by the last 30 minutes which was based on an incomprehensible and ludicrous twist. Perhaps I'd dozed off and missed some vital clues or was suffering from sun-blindness. The whole thing could have been so much better if the characters had been fleshed out and the pressures on them explored in depth, rather than just stereotyping them into a few predictable situations. I really wanted to see a good SF film, and I was really really disappointed.</fullReview>

The effects were extremely good, but when you mix it with a non consistent story and bad actors, you get sunshine, or maybe they should rather have called this movie eclipse. This really was a shadow on my day and i want those 3 hours of my life back, yes 3 because i feel i am owed some extra time for that extremely unpleasant movie. I bet my 5 year old nephew could write a better screenplay and he can't even write, he could probably even draw it better than they have written it. All of this set aside, the acting was the worst i have ever seen, but hey the only known actor was the guy from Fantastic 4 and we already know none of those actors can act. Hence why the had to get that shitty movie contract for Fantastic 4. So take my advice, don't go see it, don't even pay money for it, don't even see the trailer, even the trailer sucks and will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.I think my rating is well deemed and very objective, i had anticipations for this movie, but all it is is flash effects, and well i can see those on my own computer if i want to. So don't see it, save yourself the trouble and agony.</fullReview>

The fact that it got clone written all over it gave the whole movie away, everything more or less, happened the way I expected. If you have seen Event Horizon, this is basically a plain cover. The movies are identical.SPOILER START. In both movies a team travels through space and discovers an abandoned vessel which they for some silly reason they decide to dock with, only to pick up the villain/monster/ultimate-devil, the crew die one by one till only one remain. This is exactly the way things happened. The voice controlled control center was copied and the thrilling effects you can get from it as well. SPOILER ENDS.The characters doesn't add much to it, they are pretty much stereotypes with little or no background. The cast and performances I guess was "OK". A lot of scenes was set in white, overexposed shots, I guess to save some money, but it was really frustrating. Basically the whole movie gave me a pure-CG or heavily composed CG feeling, the outdoor scenes looked ridiculous. Being a physicist I had a good laugh from time to time, I guess that wasn't the filmmakers intentions but it was basically the only value I could harvest watching this.Anyway, this movie was awful.

		<fullReview>OK, so there are certainly movies that are worse, hence my rating of '3'. If you aren't willing to at least suspend reality a little and overlook a myriad of ridiculous premises (like we could actually kick start the sun, or even get close enough to it to try for starters...), then don't even bother at all.But if you can the movie goes along decently (albeit slowly), then there's a little plot twist and some drama.... Only to completely self destruct in a blur of mindless, dizzying mess of an ending. The movie leaps from scene to scene to scene, many of which are too dark to even make out what's going on, that is if its not so bright you can't make anything out, that is if what was happening made any sense if you could manage to make it out. Irritating. I understand that they're trying for a very cutting edge kind of visual experience, but it cuts the already shabby plot off at the knees and delivers the 'coup de grace' to finish this mess off. Disappointing for me, a fan of Boyle's work. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Raining. Raining in my heart.WARNING: This review is a refutation of the idea that Sunshine is an outstanding piece of work. It argues that the film is derivative, bland and forgettable. If you might find this idea offensive in any way you may be taking life and yourself too seriously.This will be my second review of Sunshine ? the first was deleted when someone on the message board filed an abuse report, having failed to convince me that it was a work of profound, existential beauty. It could have even been a representative of DNA films, the company that made Sunshine but dropped the ball when they allowed one of their employees to patronise naysayers who failed to buy into their abstract view of the films themes, posting in the companies name. This is a little like you and I going to McDonalds and having failed to agree that the Big Mac is a 'cow based religious experience' find our names on the companies official website with a note underneath saying 'These individuals are idiots and wouldn't know good food if you force fed it down their ungrateful fat faces.' So rather than just repost my old review, which irritatingly failed to acknowledge the grander design hot-wired into each scene, I thought I'd take some time out to reconsider the film ? after all if the production companies marketing department, critics who were given a précis of the films transcendental themes which shaped their reviews, and lets not forget the tens of people who read those articles and had their intelligence flattered by the suggestion that if they bought into said messages they'd be a notch more sophisticated than those who'd had to wing it on their limited perspective, thought it was a work of philosophical mastery ? Sartre in space you might say, then surely it's time to think again isn't it? Well, guess what? No. You see Sunshine just isn't very good. Read that sentence again because it's the nub of the review so if you have somewhere else to be you needn't bother with the rest of it. No really, I'm just going to restate what I've just said but stretch it out a bit. Boyle and Garland would probably like to believe they've made a companion piece to 2001 and the numerous other films they've taken stem cells from in order to grow their own story. They haven't. Sunshine never escapes the black hole strong gravity of its predecessors and any pretensions it has of been a film in the league of Alien or even the so-so Event Horizon, which it copies from in addition to many others (and is itself a copy), are crushed by our knowledge of those fresher and frankly more entertaining space bound adventures.What we do get is a lot of talk about moral compromise, does man deserve to survive, the sun as God making final judgement, etc? but if you're already wondering if this adds up to anything, rest easy ? you won't be thinking about any of these things after you've seen the movie because you'll have forgotten it by the time you get to the pub for the post-view discussion. Alex Garland's script ? which Danny Boyle generously described as 'Robert Bolt like' in one scene (it isn't), has plenty of ideas but no where to put them. Inevitably it's a Frankenstein collage of your favourite hits but bereft of the tension, surprise, thrills or imagination that made them worth copying in the first place. Boyle directs with the usual sure hand but doesn't or perhaps couldn't, add any flourish that might have made it more memorable. If you consider his early hits are as much about visual chutzpah as they are the wit of his early collaborators, Sunshine is a straight jacketed exercise by comparison ? predictable in both its framing and trajectory and with none of the vivid characterisation that made his first two movies such a delight. Boyle can rest easy knowing that no-one is going to ape Sunshine in twenty years. Time to call Ewan and John, Danny? Profound but only when inserted into the sentence 'A profound disappointment from the man who made Trainspotting.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was absolutely stoked for this movie, because Danny Boyle's past efforts have been amazing. Stylistic story telling that doesn't rely heavily on gore is hard to come by nowadays and Boyle seems to have a mastery of craft.But this movie falls flat because it feels like a composite of several movies and not a very good one at that. Danny Boyle says that Alien was his main inspiration for the film, but his film only keeps the pace and menace of Alien in the beginning. It also has a very similar villain as at the end of Event Horizon, one of my favorite SciFiHorror cross genres.Basically I was expecting fantastic and I came away with a bad taste in my mouth. Perhaps it was because I saw Rescue Dawn earlier in the week.My point is that this movie is nothing new, we've all seen computer generated sun and spacecraft and slow motion explosions and bloody suicides and people who die needlessly just to narrow down the characters.The sound is the best aspect of the movie, some really good mixing on their part.Go see the movie and form your own opinion, but don't be prepared to get blown away.</fullReview>

Not as good as the movies it's referencing, but not bad either. It really falls apart though when it seems like it's going to get better.Sorry, but Pinbacker isn't really explainable as a normal human being. He's become some kind of superhuman mutant, and having that as the big revelation near the end of the movie - when the tension had come to a nice fever pitch - was just shockingly bad.The movie seemed to lose touch with whether it was dealing with literal/scientific things or something more metaphysical/religious, and it completely fell between the two stools. Probably the most disappointing last half hour of a movie aside from maybe War of the Worlds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came in to see this movie after hearing a couple of good reviews and one that described the movie as 'boring'. So I expected a slow paced but pretty intense film. I'll give it one prop, it is different. The plot was slow moving, the suspense was there, and it left enough out to stimulate the imagination. There were parts that were old school sci-fi (the sound effects and some of the visuals) which is why I wanted to see it, and a few scenarios that were well written. The was also some good intensity. But most of what was good was lost because this movie was trying to be too modern and trendy. Stuff like killing off the less desirable characters first and leaving all the pretty boys/ girls in longer just seemed obvious, and some of the dialogue was at best simple. Certainly there was zero character development here, but even that is forgivable heck its a sci-fi!. To me the smoking gun was in the cinematography. The filming overall just too fractured, and the last quarter of the film just got so visually psychedelic, it made me sick of watching. You had to concentrate just to figure out what was going on and at some point that's just too annoying. The point of a film is to entertain or challenge you mentally, not challenge you visually. Overall an OK film and worth a watch out of curiosity, but definitely forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So... What would it be?"2007: A Space Odyssey" or "Mission to Sun"?To be honest, I can't say that I expected either extreme. "2001: ASO" may be the pinnacle of its indescribable genre. "Mission to Mars" is one of the biggest jokes in the genre.However, I presumed that Danny Boyle's "Sunshine" would edge closer to Kubrick's masterpiece. I'm not quite sure why I thought so. After all, re-igniting the dying sun seems a pretty routine sci-fi plot. Perhaps it was the director of the cult classic, "28 Days Later", that earned my interest. Maybe I was excited to see Rose Byrne, one of my favorite young actresses at the moment, in a starring role. The early buzz had this film near the top of my 2007 must-see list.With all that in mind, I am frustrated to say that "Sunshine" fades into obscurity due to a lethargic pace, messy editing and uninspired, inane dialogue. In addition, sci-fi movies usually have a fantastic opportunity to dazzle with spectacular effects. While "Sunshine" does have a few impressive sequences, most of the visuals are murky and dull.The basic premise has Icarus 2 flying toward the dying sun with a crew of nine and an explosive payload that could help re-ignite the sun. Icarus 2 is so named because a similar previous mission failed some years before. Needless to say, complications ensue, involving some space walks, some shield deterioration and, mysteriously, a distress call from the original Icarus vessel.There are crew disagreements, on-board fires, sacrificed lives, close calls, heroic decisions... blah, blah, blah. It rarely seems to amount to much drama or tension. Even the occasional death by sunlight exposure plays as entirely ho-hum.None of the characters are drawn well enough to drum up emotion from the audience. Most of the acting is substituted with overly dramatic posing. Only the talented Byrne is ever able to muster the effort required to squeeze something out of this screenplay.It is all just so disappointingly below average -- in every conceivable way. "Sunshine" is never a truly horrible film, on a level with "Mission to Mars"... But it never even sniffs the heels of "2001: ASO". It feels more like a low budget "Alien" without the actual alien.I held out hope for a rousing conclusion... filled to the brim with wonderment and originality. Perhaps there would be an enlightening and inspirational final act that would leave me steeped in thought about all the complexity and meaning that had eluded me so far...Nope. It degenerates into a feverishly over-edited piece of schlock. I was reduced to head-scratching confusion at how messy and pointless it all was.The sunlight fades early on in this film and, despite the meager efforts of a muddled director and a flat cast, it never manages to regain much of a spark. What a real shame! I had high hopes for this one, but I was way off.Written by TC Candler IndependentCritics.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an absolute load of rubbish! If you like bad, ill thought out films, you'll love this one. The plot started off promisingly enough and the setting was quite impressive but the film soon teetered off into confusing mediocrity, before hitting you with a pointless and idiotic twist and finally culminating in a scrappy and rushed ending. The idea wasn't too bad - our sun is dying so a ship is sent from earth carrying a nuclear bomb designed to be fired into the sun, hopefully re-igniting it ? but after about half an hour, confusion and boredom took over and it was a struggle to keep up.The plot itself was easy enough to follow but I still found myself confused as to what was going on in certain points. I didn't find any of the characters particularly likable ? only the captain and he was disposed of pretty early on. And don't even get me started on the twist. Ludicrous! The sad thing is they could have done so much with this story.In true sci-fi fashion, I think it's customary to try and pick out which characters will be left standing at the end of the film and to my surprise, after about twenty minutes of watching, I was able to pick out the four that actually went the distance ? or further than the others at least.If you like good sci-fi, this isn't for you. My advice is, instead of wasting your time and money on this nonsense, get out your DVD's of Alien, Star Wars or some other classic and indulge in sci-fi at its best. In short, confusing twaddle.

		<shortDescription>Warning: this film will self-destruct in 83 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For 83 minutes, Danny Boyle's Sunshine is an above average sci-fi film with a great hook ? a potential suicide mission to reignite the dying sun - and, if not entirely realistic (the sun's far too powerful to approach even with heat shields), it's at least credible enough to dispel any worries that this is going to turn out to be Solar Crisis 2. Thanks to some excellent character development (with one underwritten exception in Troy Garity's case), the first two thirds work because the focus is kept firmly on the human element, and it's human error that is the root cause of the increasing obstacles that threaten the mission. When things go wrong at first, it's a series of logical consequences of a mathematical error, and the film follows these through with a mechanical logic, constantly proving adept at offering hope only to remove it.Unfortunately it misses a few opportunities by keeping too cool a head at times: rather than tempers rising along with the temperature and rational decision making being affected by the purely physical affects of an increasingly hostile environment providing the drama, Boyle and writer Alex Garland show the same confusion over how to end this picture as they famously did with 28 Days Later and decide to introduce an external threat which takes the phrase deus ex machina to new lows. The nature of the threat didn't work for George Pal in the 1950s and works even worse here.Things start to get dodgy around an airlock sequence where it's revealed that tinfoil and holding your breath might just work in a minus 272 degree vacuum. And, in retrospect, it seems unbelievable that the life of the only crew member who knows how to program their payload would be risked needlessly out of a fit of pique from one character earlier in the film (or indeed that on such a crucial mission there would be only one crew member to know how to do it). But it's with the introduction of an anomaly on the oxygen supply that the film's IQ drops to single figures as it makes a sudden severe shift of genre and into the realms of absurdity. Characters don't communicate and put themselves needlessly at risk, Chris Evans suddenly develops such an immunity to low temperatures you're wondering if you're watching outtakes from Fantastic Four and, what's even worse is that having created two more than efficient female characters in Michelle Yeoh and Rose Byrne, it gives them absolutely nothing to do in the attempts to salvage the mission, deciding instead to reduce them to dispensable victims: that's just so 70s, Danny. Just to put the tin lid on it, even within it's own suddenly limited ambitions, these sequences are extremely poorly executed with a notable lack of tension and an almost comical belief that blurring the screen or smearing the lens with Vaseline is inherently frightening. And it gets confusing as hell. I don't think I've seen a film so completely shoot itself in the foot in the home stretch since Tequila Sunrise.Within this section there are still some good moments, but if only they'd removed the external element and reshot and reedited the ending and put their faith in the inherent drama of the premise. Like throwing a lion at a character attempting to walk a tightrope over a pit of alligators while under heavy machine-gun fire to up the risk factor (Armageddon not enough for you, boys?), it simply reduced the audience to laughter. A shame, because it coulda been a contender (still could if they cut out one character, do a quick reshoot and re-edit for the States), but despite some good visuals and strong performances (particularly Hiroyuki Sanada and Cliff Curtis in what could have been throwaway parts) I just left the theatre thinking how much more technically accomplished the ending of Event Horizon was, and that's never a good thing.And it started out so well?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Badly recycled garbage from start to finish. Here's a partial list of why IMHO.1. No subplots. Subplots help get you involved and caring about the characters. The plot of refiring the sun was established in the first 30 seconds (and in the publicity). Will they save Earth or not? But subplots, stories within the story, were totally missing. As a result, we knew next to nothing about the crew, their background, hopes, fears. I never felt involved and I didn't care what happened to the crew.2. Technical Implausibilities.a. Why would anyone send a manned mission? Even now we've had unmanned planet landings; much more complex than simply jettisoning a bomb into the Sun.b. Lack of Gravity ignored. OK, it's inconvenient, irrelevant and expensive to have everything floating around. I think part of the ship was rotating but at the start a crew member was watching the Sun direct but filtered and it was not turning around.c. How is refiring the Sun with an enormous bomb going to work? If the Sun starts running out of hydrogen, it needs more and not a bomb whose energy would be quickly dissipated.d. When the Sun starts dying, in around 5 billion years, it will first expand swallowing the inner planets including Earth. i.e. we'll burn to death, not freeze.e. Space vessel pointlessly enormous. They were using rocket technology, so getting something this size into space whether as a whole or in bits would be a pointless and costly exercise. Smaller is better, particularly when you have to fill it with oxygen.3. Badly plagiarized bits from 2001 and Alien (mentioned by others here). e.g. computer taking over, voice dropping in tone as it shuts down, camera shots, music styles etc etc.4. How did the burnt survivor get on board the other ship? Why was he burnt, always blurred, capable of unlimited nastiness. I thought I was watching another preview of Spiderman 3 for a while there. At least he didn't burst out from someone's stomach.5. Illogical jumps. Too many to remember. e.g. After having said that Icarus I was on Mercury, how did they couple with it in space? Often jumps so bad that, like the director, I completely lost the plot.6. Only 1 person trained to release the bomb. Yeah, right. This was given as reason when deciding who was going to stay behind in Icarus I to operate the airlock.7. Navigator gets calculations on orbit change wrong ('I've F...d up'). And no-one checked the results? Almost as hard to believe as their seemingly unending supply of rocket fuel.8. Dialogue varied from inane to uninteresting. I pitied the poor actors.9. Set in the future, the crew's clothing and hair styles were very 90s. The technical gear, screens etc were very much of today with a few more coloured lights added.SUMMARY: Save your money and time and go play solitaire on your mobile phone, ring a friend, have a coffee...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer for this movie, I was excited. It appeared to be a "proper" science fiction movie, the kind we haven't had since the seventies - in the style of Silent Running, 2001 or even dear old Alien. The part where the computer tells Capa that there's an unidentified individual on the ship had all the makings of a tense psychological cat-and-mouse game. Instead, we got what seemed to be an inexplicable tacked-on psycho-on-board ending.After 28-Days Later, I was expecting the Boyle/Garland duo to deliver another perfectly constructed genre movie. They did Zombie so well, surely they could do space-drama too. But instead they dropped the ball and delivered something interminably dull, where the tension and drama derived from a series of blunders that seemed to drive the storyline. The characters were merely reactive in all their actions, meaning that none took the role of 'hero' and with it our interest and our sympathy.The movie fails to give any context to the mission, and without believing that earth is dying I found it hard to care that it supposedly was. In fact, when they finally showed us the earth, it looked like a paradise to the snowboarder in me. Not dying, just white.The premise that a few tons of fissile material could re-ignite a dying star is spurious at best. But that wasn't the point, Sunshine is not really a movie about saving the planet - although that motive is woven into the tale, ostensibly to give it some point. It's a study in sanity... which might have been interesting, if it hadn't been so boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a preview screening of Sunshine in Sydney on August 11 and whilst I was very impressed with the stunning visual effects and incredible sound design, I ultimately found the movie disappointing.Danny Boyle has done a terrific job creating the world of a spacecraft. From the very outset, one is immediately transported into a beautiful yet claustrophobic atmosphere. Impressive visual effects and exquisite sound design reminded me of just why I love seeing movies on the big screen and this is an excellent cinematic experience.However, visual and aural pleasures don't maketh the movie. Unfortunately, what this film lacks is decent characterisations. While I can't fault the acting ? Cillian Murphy was especially charismatic ? the characters never evolved beyond mere role-plays, in that I felt no emotional connection with any of them. For me to fully engage in a story, I think this is a necessity.The ultimate letdown was the story which, although it's a great idea, never got beyond that. Whilst there were many different themes it could've explored, the film instead went down a strangely predictable path bereft of any major subtext.If you're a sci-fi fan that likes a good thriller then I recommend seeing this film on the big screen ? a DVD just wouldn't do it justice. If, however, you like a film with a bit more meat on it then maybe skip this one and read a good book instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most tedious and boring film I've seen in a long time. This film started off okay, as your thinking, "anytime now its going to start" unfortunately it never did, and after an hour, half the cinema was dozing off. The only reason are group didn't leave was because we may have woken someone up. If you are determined to see this film please save yourself some cash and wait till its on TV.I would suggest a film called Event Horizon though some don't like it I've always found it a good film and Sunshine seems to have leeched some ideas from it. I guess if you haven't seen Event Horizon this film might bearable, but if you have your wasting your time. If you like films that have no plot and are exceedingly predictable, or if you require a sleep aid then please go see it, if not then save your money and doing else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunshine is a real stinker. There's no getting away from it. It looks nice, I'll give it that, but aside from the uninspired directing, the real problem with this film is the total and UTTER failure of its screenplay. So you need to send a bomb to the sun. Over looking the complete idiocy of the concept of restarting the Sun in just 50 years time, consider this: We can remote operate rovers on Mars ? now. We can send probes to Venus, to Jupiter, to Saturn. We are still in contact with two probes that have left the solar system altogether. Yet in this story they have to put six or seven people on board a ship that's only travelling 93 million miles. No only that, but they do it ? TWICE because the first ship never makes it. So in this story mankind is so very stupid it never learns from its mistakes. So what's the point in the story? Is it somehow a deep psychological deconstruction of its characters? Nope. We never find out a thing about them. They spend all their time having to press this button so they can get some other thing to work. And they never split up. They're always in a group, huddled around a table, most of them with blank expressions on their faces and without a line of dialogue between them. It looks and feels like Big Brother. This movie is vacuous, pretentious nonsense. It appeals to people with or no personality or imagination, exactly the same personality types that may have bought into The Beach; another horrendous movie by the talentless, yet inexplicably working, Garland. Garland knows nothing about real characterization, depth or motivation. He knows absolutely nothing about decent science fiction. It is simply baffling how this script ever got funded in the first place.</fullReview>

I know it is FICTION but have the decency to at least pretend that it isn't fiction! They did the worst thing you could do to a sci-fi flick.

		<shortDescription>Better looking than a PlayStation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine starts with a none-too-original end-of-the-world scenario - the sun is dying. It follows the crew of an ill-fated spaceship that aims to kick-start our source of light and heat with a bomb the size of Manhattan. An accelerating sense of inevitable doom accompanies the heroes, interspersed with a sense of wonder at sights such as Mercury crossing the sun, and a twist ending which strains continuity and any lingering hopes of originality or believability.But firstly the good bits. Special effects are stunning. Literally. It's as if Kubrick 2001: A Space Odyssey had risen from the archives, imbued with every wonder known to modern technology and NASA video footage. It is so visually awesome that if I watched it again it would be with earplugs so I could enjoy it without distraction.And the distraction is legion. If we have moved into an era where no-one hears you scream in space, apparently director Danny Boyle has not been told. An overpowering, constantly intrusive soundtrack provides wooshes, whistles, rumbles and imaginative electronic audio sensations for every piece of action, inside or outside the craft. Lugubrious editing justifies each fresh thunderous boom, for we are invited to admire every beautifully created visual sensation for rather longer than the weak plot on its own can sustain.Characters are so underdeveloped that I constantly searched for someone to care about. One girl (who looks barely out of college) takes a momentary stand to save the life of one of her fellow astronauts, so I rooted for her to survive. Most of these astronauts I would not have let loose on my nephew's model train set, much less a PlayStation or - heaven forbid - a spaceship. That Boyle and writer Alex Garland (28 Days Later...) are totally out of their depth becomes clear as they throw some naff religious psychosis into the mix. Scientists saving earth? I'd rather trust a poodle. Not that we are ever told why the ship needs to be manned in the first place.Even if the acting was above the barely passable, the script offers little scope. And the spaceship is named Icarus. That's a bit like building an ocean liner and calling it Sinker.Danny Boyle hit the limelight with Shallow Grave and then achieved well-deserved international fame with Trainspotting. He has been quoted as saying, "Once you've had anything like a hit in the movie business it's so easy to get lost. All these people are scuttling around trying to get you to make things, suggesting things and offering deals. The pressure of what to do next is horrible." Pressure or not, it would seem his choices have been increasingly poor. From a movie that that set new standards in its incisive portrayal of Scottish drug addicts, he has dabbled in areas where his weaknesses are all too glaringly obvious. Gone is the annoying DV format which looked irritatingly grainy in the similarly dystopian 28 Days Later ... : Sunshine is visually dazzling. But whereas the cross-genre attempts in his earlier sci-fi still retained many fans, this lacklustre effort seems set to reduce them. A waste of consummate artwork and photography, Sunshine ultimately needs more than a giant bomb to make it enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a Mixed bag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine by Danny Boyle is a film that starts out strong but ultimately falls apart.The film's cast are consistently solid and even Chris Evans gives a good performance. Cillian Murphy was, surprisingly, the weak performance of the film and even if he is playing a physician, it seemed like a padded character who gave exposition and when tried to give some depth, ended up making it just a tiny bit more dimensional. The visuals are remarkably impressive and the FX themselves do give a run to some of Hollywood's finest FX films. The use of golden glows and warm oranges effectively evoke a sense of peace and hope as the film aspires. Now, the film's true problem is the third act. First and second act are solid all the way, raising questions and doubts as well as tension. We get a sense that the film is building on its characters and that the theme itself is represented by them, but then an unprecedented turning point pulls the strings and makes this film go spiraling out of control.Disappointing, especially considering that it came from Danny Boyle. He could've used more time and considerably so since, for a sci-fi film, it runs short with just an hour and 40 minutes. It also renders a lot of scenes without complete resolution and raising far too many questions.The third act pretty much loses point on any kind of theme or other secondary plots and seems to just want to rush towards the ending and get it all over with and in the end, we're left with a film that leaves itself to float in space. In the end, we're left with unfinished themes and a finale that strives for a triumphant uplifting while we simply roll our eyes at the screen.</fullReview>

The plots have so many holes I can't enjoy all of the good things that are there. Would have helped if I had seen it at the cinema then I could have at least enjoyed the visuals, but even then that would not have compensated for a story that seemed to grab at everything that has gone before but could not mould into something that worked.Perhaps there are no more great space movie scripts out there.

		<fullReview>It's arty; and that's never a good sign with science fiction. It's usually an excuse to pack out a shallow storyline with lots of lengthy, needless camera-panning, plays of light, and mood music. And that's pretty-well what we get.A group of extremely youthful astronauts are apparently dispatched to reinvigorate a wilting sun. Quite what it is they're carrying in their comparatively minuscule spaceship that can have the least effect upon a heavenly body so vast it could swallow the entire solar system without a burp is slightly obscure. But, off they go.It seems that they're the second attempt. A previous ship and crew were apparently lost without trace. Yet despite the hugeness of space, they encounter this vessel en-route, picking-up its garbled distress call. Remember 'Alien' and 'Event Horizon'? Like that. They change course and rendezvous.Well, naturally, things go wrong, big bits blow up. There's fires etc. And - surprise, surprise - the captain of the lost vessel is still alive and gets aboard their ship. Naturally, he's gone mad, like you would. Oh-dear; he's homicidal etc.So, now they have to hunt him down in order to complete their mission. And he starts systematically bumping them off. Remember 'Alien' and 'Event Horizon' again? Most are killed, but they fulfil their task and the sun brightens up.A great deal of vacuous artiness could be sliced from this movie without compromising the storyline. It would just be left looking like what it really is - a simple formulaic sci-fi yarn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all time favorite Sci-Fi films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has become one of my all time favorite films. Contrary to an earlier review which said thrillers are inherently lessened on a second viewing, I definitely feel I benefited from my second and third viewings, despite knowing all the surprises. Like many of Boyle's films, there are nuances to be appreciated over and over again, and new ones to discover.I understand the disappointment by some in the third act, chiefly because it is such a change in tone. But again, on a repeated viewing, once you already know what's coming, you can see how the third act very much does fit in with the film's themes. There is a massive undertone of man versus nature, and the ability of the human spirit to overcome. The film's message is one of overcoming through science. The third act addresses this by challenging science with religion and fanaticism, much as in Contact.Visually, Sunshine is almost unparalleled. I do not think I have ever seen better special effects before. The set designs and lighting are phenomenal, and of course everything benefits from Boyle's direction. The score is also one of the best I've ever heard, aside from the jarring song that greets you as the credits open (which gives way to a much nicer song as the entire film plays again in a small frame next to the rest of the credits).The acting is excellent as well, and really made me appreciate some talents I'd overlooked before (Murphy, Yeoh, Evans) and introduced me to some I hope to see in the future (Curtis, Sanada, Byrne) Any criticism about the science I completely let go, despite being an arm-chair astronaut/physicist myself. The problem and proposed solution of the plot are never gone into specifically, and so I don't see a point in noting mistakes when it's all theoretical and fictitious anyway (although there are a few legit mistakes). For those who're interested, there is a commentary track on the DVD by a real life physicist.Again, now one of my all time favorite films, and one of the most watched films in my collection. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see about 3 movies a week, from Shindler's list, to Scary Movie 4. But the only way I know that a movie is truly one of the best is one that makes me cry. Few movies have done that to me, and I hold those as my favorites, no matter how much time passes. Sure, when I was 5 I cried when Bambi's mother died, now I wait for that part, just so I can laugh at how terribly over-dramatic it seems. Yes, I know, I'm an evil, heartless bastard. I get that a lot. But this movie immersed me in a way that no other movie has done before. some have gotten close, but never on a level that Sunshine has done. Into the Wild, V for Vendetta, and Lawrence of Arabia were the only 3 other movies that make me feel like I could be there, and feel exactly what they felt, and I can imagine what it would be like to be alongside them, and save them from the tragedies that make me shed those rare tears. This movie was different because I cried twice. I won't say were, because it would spoil some of the best parts, but I tried to look away to save myself, but it just kept bringing me back, and that masterpiece of a soundtrack didn't help much either.In short, watch sunshine, and see what I saw, and experience this one of a kind epic that I will remember for years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good science fiction drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing the long line of movies over the years which deal with a possible destruction of our planet Earth, "Sunshine" is a very entertaining science fiction drama. Just don't take the "science" too seriously.It is in the fairly near future and our star, our source of energy, the Sun, is fading away. The Earth is cooling and if something very drastic is not done, mankind on Earth will all die out soon.One mission had already been sent, but it mysteriously never achieved its goal, and no one on Earth knew why. The mission we witness is the follow-up, the last chance to save our Sun and life on Earth. A pretty heavy responsibility! We are spared all the preliminaries, how the explosive device was built, how the space ship was built and launched, the planning, the transit time, etc. We just pick them up about half-way to the Sun, with a giant solar shield leading the way, keeping them from burning to a crisp. The plan is to get within a certain distance, launch the explosive devices towards the Sun, then retreat back to Earth in time to not be incinerated in the process. Of course the Earth will be in a completely different part of its orbit, so the whole round-trip had better take one year or they will not be able to land back home.The drama occurs when not all goes as planned. A fire destroys their oxygen garden, meaning they may not have enough food and oxygen to complete the trip -- unless they can cut the crew number in half. Plus, they get a mysterious signal which they finally realize is the lost mission. Should they investigate or continue with their mission?SPOILERS: They decide to change their trajectory to meet up with the other mission, lost several years earlier. They found evidence, a recording, that the captain had sabotaged the mission because he did not believe we should mess with God's business. If the Sun is burning out, so be it. In the process several more crew members died. And, with lots of drama and close calls, the explosive device was successfully launched, and the movie ends with a bright day on Earth, the Sun shining again as it should.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the Zombie/survival thriller with "28 days later", Danny Boyle continues his personal exploration of a popular genre with an adult science-fiction movie. And the least we can say about it is that it's certainly is a Danny Boyle movie : if all the qualities of his previous movies are here (a brilliant casting, an original thematic, a certain respect to the genre), all their defaults are present too (a video-game/clip style, an rather confuse scrip that never stick to an idea and gives the feeling to go in every direction, without choosing one, a stupid ending).The question is to know if the good ideas overcome the bad habits in this "Sunshine", or if the incoherences of the movie eclipse its qualities.The story and atmosphere of the movie is rather classic in the SF cinema (it's a mix of "2001", "Alien" and "The thing"): a crew of different people are stuck together in a spaceship in order to save the earth. While they try to rebirth the sun to do so, problems keep rising. And when they reach the edge of madness, the cohabitation becomes more and more dangerous. In my opinion, the confused directing and editing style of Boyle perfectly fits the atmosphere of the movie, and makes its multiple ruptures seems more rational. It also adds tension and surprise to what could have been a boring huit-clot in a space ship. The fact that the movie gives several directions, but forgets some of them in its trip also participates to its originality and prevents the spectator to get bored. The movie also adds to this confused tension some beautiful scenes (particulary the death of some of the characters), that really presents a brilliant use of the ice/fire elements in space. But it's also true that at some point, I'd say past the 2/3 of the movie, the interest disappears when tones and plot of the film keet changing, until a ridiculous and incredible ending.You really have to enjoy Boyle's style if you want to like this movie, that will certainly leave a strange taste to the people unfamiliar with his cinema. But strangeness and originality are two appreciable qualities when it comes to space movies.</fullReview>

I was particularly surprised at Chris Evans' performance - having only seen him in Fantastic Four, I was glad to see him pull off a believable role in this which is so much different than Johnny Storm. I'm having a hard time with Cillian Murphy's American accent though - why didn't they just let him speak with his Irish accent? The American one is perhaps a little overwrought and doesn't really suit him.I loved the atmospheric, psychological setting of the story here. Credit to Underworld for providing the music and proving to me there there is a lot more to them than Born Slippy. The sound design can be quite intense at times - there's very little chance of you falling asleep!There are silly elements which are hard to forgive, and towards the end it becomes a little "what's happening?", although the film is a feast for the eyes and ears and well worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One great sci-fi flick!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine comes from the Director of 28 Days Later, which unarguably is the best Zombie movie to come out of anywhere in a few decades. With Sunshine director Danny Boyle, known for his take on the awe-inspiring has come out with a "Wham-bam-thank-you-mam" of a movie. Sunshine isn't just any other Sci-Fi "Save the World" movie where a bunch of Astronauts are put into a Space Shuttle and sent into space to do there 'thingy' and rescue the Earth. It is all of that.. And much more!The story, states that 50years into the future our Sun is dying. A crew is sent on a journey to the Sun with a payload containing half of all the world's nuclear power to cause an explosion in the Sun in order to restart its glow. It fails. Seven years later, another mission is sent. Earth's last hope. Her last chance. The Icarus II space shuttle is armed with a payload containing the remainder of Earth's nuclear power, and a group of scientists-cum-astronauts in whose hands lies the Fate of our planet.Right from the opening sequence one will realize that the movie is visually stunning. It has got some scenes which would make any person go "Wow!" The cast - A surprise. Most will notice that the faces are familiar. But who are they? Whoever they are, they have done an amazing job. Cilian Murphy, who was the lead actor in 28 Days Later, gives us another display of what he can do. This movie is non conventionality redefined. Every character has a story to tell. Every moment has an emotion to capture. Every shot has a lasting effect. Right from the Commander of the ship to the Botanist cum Astronaut, everyone plays an equal part in making up the movie.Sunshine has a distinct background score. It is a mix of electronica, with alternative rock and jazz. Particular splashes of beautiful music occur in two sequences. One with two of the lead characters in the payload, and the other in the observation room with the whole crew awed at the sight of something so amazing that I could not help my jaw falling open and the occasional smile. The alternative rock score at the end of the movie is, simple put, magnificent. I would love to own the soundtrack of this film. The song at the closing credits by I Am Kloot - Avenue of Hope, is mesmerizing.At an hour and fifty minutes, Sunshine is never a bore or a waste of time. The director, with his minute details; and the cast, even with its silence is as gripping as is Will Smith kicking some bad-ass aliens (ala Independence Day), or Bruce Willis blowing up a whole darn asteroid (Armageddon). What the heart wants, what it desires to know and see, can lead one till death. This is one of the many things about human nature that is shown clearly in Sunshine.Sunshine comes as a breath of fresh air to the Sci-fi movie go'ers as well as lovers of a good action movie, with a storyline. It comes across as a sci-fi/thriller/action film for. It is not merely cinematic pleasure, it is also a feeling that makes you say,"Ya, that was a good movie. Worth the ticket money!"8/10 for the acting. Same for the story. And straight A's for the visuals/music/direction. I loved this, I absolutely loved this!"And we wait to see just what we will become.." - Avenue of Hope(I Am Kloot - End Credits)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunshine ( 2007)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film's failing in the box office is perhaps the biggest shame of 2007, because it is really one terrific film. I honestly cannot count seeing one promo or movie trailer promoting it, despite the fact that films such as Spiderman 3, Rush Hour 3, Shrek 3, Pirates 3, ........ all made huge money during the Summer Box Office: despite being gigantic pieces of crap.The story is very engaging, and the acting is fantastic. Directed by the distinctive style of famed Director Danny Boyle ( 28 Days Later, Transpotting, The Beach). Sunshine's biggest strengths are it's visuals and score, which are just downright jaw-dropping and epic.Film score composer John Murphy gets some special props here- especially with the themes used during Kaneda's death and Capa's trip to the bomb. Also, of note is that the same music can now be heard in the Cloverfield trailers .Set in the year 2057, Sunshine concerns the dying sun and the spacecraft Icarus II, which sets out with a nuclear device in hopes of resuscitating the fading heat source, seven years after the disappearance of Icarus I while on a similar mission.I really can't find anything wrong with any of the performances. Cillian Murphy, who has always brought a slightly disturbing quirkiness to his characters, is as reliable as ever here, as Capa. A very under-stated performance.Rose Byrne gives a sincere, sweet, and strong performance as Cassie, the spacecraft's pilot.It is Byrne who displays the most relatable human qualities. One of my favorite scenes from the film, was her characters moral stand in regards to the crew voting in order to kill off the character of Trey. In her heart, she knows that it has to happen, but she refuses to add her name to that....." Find a kindness." Many actresses would have struggled trying to balance Cassie, but Byrne always has a way of bringing real raw emotion to her roles.There's a sad quality to her beauty ( no makeup at all) which has surely resulted in her being consistently hired to play characters whose destinies don't work out especially well. Just, in the past year, movie goers have seen her have her head bashed in by Robert Carlyle in 28 Weeks Later, and in this film-she ends up getting incinerated/blown to smithereens.Any Sci-Fi fan will be able to see the influences of such films as Event Horizon, Alien, 2001 &amp; Solaris throughout Sunshine. I especially loved the little hints at Alien, notable through some of the dialgue as well. " Might get picked off by aliens." Great supporting work as well, from such actors as Michelle Yeoh, Chris Evans (I was kind of surprised that I actually liked him in this), Troy Garity, Benedict Wong, Cliff Curtis and Hiroyuki Sanada.I know a lot of people who are quite put off by the film's third half, the ending, etc. Most notably, the character of Pinbacker ( Mark Strong) However, I quite enjoyed the hell out of it. Of course, it does follow a kinda Danny Boyle approach to monsters, in the vein of its always humans to fear, not zombies or aliens.I wonder what you all think about the character of Pinbacker, and what Boyle and team were trying to accomplish or say. Pinbacker shows the extremes which the mission could so to someone...... even more the character does show what horrifying ends a fundamentalist can go to. Subtheme of religion versus science.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an exceptional movie. One of the best science fictions I have ever seen. I don't understand why this movie was not advertised more. It didn't stay in theaters a week in South Florida. I live in Palm Beach and drove all the way to Miami to see it. Was worth the drive. I am very disappointed that such a good movie was not well advertised. This movie had the potential to make a lot of money. I did not see one advertisement for this movie. Spoiler. I have a few questions here that the director should have fixed or explained. If the ship's computer was smart to adjust itself when the shields were being worked on? Why couldn't it automatically adjust itself to stop the sensors from burning out? Also is there actually any material than can survive on it's way to the sun surface? GREAT MOVIE THOUGH!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie a few weeks ago and I understood it alright but still I feel like I have to watch it again to take it all in. There's a lot going on in this movie, the dialogs, the action and at the same time I feel that this movie makes you think so there's a lot going on while you watch it.It's far from mainstream si-fi, at least the ones I have seen and it's really something else. It's hard to comment on this movie without giving it away and at the same time it's hard to explain without going into details and I don't want to put in any spoilers. I guess the easiest thing to do is watch it yourself even if you're not a big si-fi fan (I'm not) and I believe that if your open minded enough this movie can blow you away.I usually don't like watching movies over and over again but I make a few exceptions, this will be one too.See it, it's worth your time, your money and thinking about the whole idea of 'what if one day....'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not without entertainment of course. But you could be forgiven to compare those movies. A mission to outer space to save the world (the premise of the movie) ... but if there are any similarities, they do stop here.You got a stellar cast, I wasn't aware before I saw the movie, that so many different nations were present in this movie. So it's not like you have only Americans up there who try to "save the day". Of course they have their own egos and everyone has his own personality. But still that could've been explored more, the nuances between the characters. Apart from that, this wouldn't be a movie, if everything would run smoothly. That much you could guess yourself, but everything that happens, does add to the suspense! Only one obstacle will or might leave you a bit confused or even annoyed. Other than that a great little big sci-fi thriller!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This is more NASA than 'Star Wars'. It is reality-based." - Boyle's dumb words, not mine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the crew of "Icarus 2" I thought I was hallucinating because I thought I was witness to some students jabbering on a university campus. What strange future Boyle imagines in which astronauts are all in their 20s, half of them thinner than Di Crapio. Has the new weakened Sun killed off all the older folks for some boyleish reason? And just as one could expect from drunk students, a fight very quickly breaks out over absolutely nothing between Evans and Murphy. After all, every movie must have CONFLICT, that magic word. I suppose people like Garland (who wrote this shoddy script) don't think that the premise of saving the world is dramatic enough for the viewers, so we must have idiotic personal conflicts thrown in, as well, between astronauts - no less - who are supposed to be mentally stable, i.e. not behaving like school-kids every 5 minutes.Speaking of mental stability, just about half of all the astronauts in this movie have some serious mental problems. We have a suicidal case, we have a second-in-command who is extremely nervous under pressure and even a flaming coward, we have - as mentioned - Murphy and Evans who brawled not once but TWICE, we have Yeoh as a sort of botanist who probably speaks to flowers and sings them songs and hysterically screams when one single leaf dies or rises from the ashes, and finally, we have an astronaut-turned-sun-demon-God who has gone the way of the Bible.Does the NASA of the future stop all psychological testing of prospective astronauts? How could world-saving missions consist of so many mental weaklings? If these two a**hole crews are the best that this boyleish future world can muster, then I must wonder if it's even worth saving.As far as the previous mission's captain going religiously berserk, I have seen that dumb plot-device used in a silly 50s B-movie called "Conquest Of Space", where the captain of the mission to Mars suddenly decides that God is against any kind of human intrusion in space and sabotages the mission. Is this where Hollywood's "hottest" new writers take their inspirations from? Dumb old movies? Comic-books even? Boyle must have been so confident about the look/make-up effects of the Sun-demon that he blurred him out in just about every scene.Toward the end, when half the space morons are dead, why don't the remaining studentonauts have walky-talkys? They actually have to look for each other on that VAST ship to tell each other that there is danger afoot!In spite of the flaws I didn't think the plot was going badly - at least not until this sci-fi movie became a dumb horror film. The appearance of the Sun demon made me laugh and shake my head, but then I reminded myself that I was watching a Boyle movie, and as all intelligent movie-goers know: a Boyle movie can always contain some shocking nonsense. Boyle has a low I.Q., and that has often balanced out i.e. neutralized his directing talents.Again the same question: isn't saving the world drama/conflict enough? Do we need a monster that makes no logical sense? How could this man possibly have acquired these powers? And yet Boyle misleads us in the first hour into thinking we are watching a more-or-less reality-based sci-fi, as opposed to something like "Alien" or "Starship Troopers".Science. Evidently a dirty word for Boyle and Garland, who must have a loathing for it. Didn't these guys go to school? Don't they have a pair of eyes and a brain? Even 5-th graders with Fs in Science class will laugh at this movie's "physics". Murphy BREATHES while facing the "walls"(?) of the Sun - WITHIN the Sun?!! Not even do the tips of his hair burn. His finely coiffed hair remains as stylish-looking as ever. Apparently, this future Sun has grown so cold that one can easily go inside it and get away with just a nice little tan. Who else but Boyle (and maybe De Palma, another movie intellectual) would have agreed to shoot such a daft scene! We've also got Murphy's wrestling buddy, Evans (ironically, Flame-boy in "The Fantastic Four"), surviving -273 C with nothing more than frost-bite. One question: if his finger-tips were black how come they weren't amputated? I am not a nit-picker when it comes to scientific fact in sci-fis, but extreme heat and extreme cold are such basic concepts that no-one can go around them by pretending that -273 C or 25,000,000 C is nothing special.Maybe someone should have burnt Garland's and Boyle's fingertips with an iron, just as a little reality check. "Hey guys, this is heat, in case you've forgotten!" Why is the Indian guy in such a rush to kill himself? Isn't he curious to inspect "Icarus 1" in his final hours? Or to see if the mission succeeds? Very annoying, the way Murphy whispers in the first scenes as a narrator. I thought astronauts were supposed to be real men with real timber in their voices, and not sound like scared little school-girls.I am even willing to overlook the nonsense about the Sun dying, about a bomb that will "re-start it", about a ship that orbits the Sun and doesn't melt like an Albanian ice-cream in the African heat, and I didn't even care that the movie is unoriginal and "borrows" heavily from "Event Horizon" and many other movies. But there is too much other nonsense going on.Still, there is a very nice visual look and it isn't boring. The only reason I didn't give "Sunshine" a much lower rating is because I'm a sucker for sci-fi films, even when they're incredibly dumb. "Never send students into space to save the world, because we might all die as a result of their incompetence." That must be Boyle's message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a shame that Fox Searchlight appears to have deemed this film not worthy of advertising, because it was a highly intelligent, taut sci-fi thriller, the likes of which hasn't been seen in what seems like forever. Danny Boyle adapts his trademark filming style to the sci-fi genre really well, and his leading man from 28 Days Later, Cillian Murphy, gives his best performance since that flick. The science and the thrills were all much more realistic and believable than similar science-thrillers of recent years. The only drawbacks of the film are, the end was unnecessarily over-melodramatic and poorly filmed in parts, with too many blurry shots and quick cuts. But on the whole, the film was great, and I highly recommend it, especially to fans of Sci-fi, thrillers and Danny Boyle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a feeling the wrong people are commenting on this flick. I hear a lot of either ' this is an awesome flick ruined by the third act,' and, 'stunning visuals, but not a great story.' When it comes down to it, this movie is absolutely fantastic. First off, the visuals, are hands down the main attraction of the movie. People have been trying to say 'oh yeah, it's like 2001...' but it's not. Its like 2001 after eating twenty grams of mushrooms. It is down right mind boggling. As far as the story is concerned, shut your mouth. If you want something with realism, go see a documentary. It's a sci-fi movie, things that happen are going to be hard to believe. I was never let down the entire movie, and having had little sleep the night before, i should have been snoozing. But instead, my eyes were like dinner plates the entire way through. Right up until the song at the credits, which is one of the best sounds to roll out with after such a trip. I'm seriously struggling to say this isn't my favorite my movie of all time. If you want a complex story, go see some stupid period piece. If you want an enjoyable movie, go see this.P.S. - as much as i like cillian murphy, i got to hand it to the guy that played the psychiatrist, that man is nuts</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this film. Although Danny Boyle's movies, to date, have ranged from the sublime (i.e. "Trainspotting," "Shallow Grave") to the ridiculous ("The Beach," "28 Days Later"), there has been a real buzz about this film prior to its release, and the trailer was intriguing. While the film is not without merit?the interior set design of the spaceship is visually arresting and the CGI rendering of space and the sun is literally stunning?I found the film to be somewhat less than the sum of its parts.Clearly ambitious in scope, and interesting for much of its running time, the film fails to answer some of the big questions that it raises and seems to get away from itself near the end. It also requires an unusually large suspension of disbelief from the viewer?if one is to accept its central premise and subsequent plot developments. I also found the experience somewhat derivative; the film certainly owes a debt to Tarkovsky's "Solaris" (1972) and Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968), both masterpieces of their time. But the film was also reminiscent of more recent schlock like "Event Horizon," begging the question of why did the director not try harder to make a more interesting and relevant contribution to a recently uninventive and uninspiring genre?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunshine There was a time for space fiction movies (Star Wars, Alien, etc.) and we enjoyed them. Though fictional, they seemed probable. The era has gone and long time since a good space movie is seen. As Sunshine boasted of it, I was tempted to see it.In today's global warming world this movie tells the story about the dying sun and a mission from earth to activate the dying spot on sun. This is the second mission in seven years (the first was lost) led by a group of young men (four) and women (three). There are usual technical hitches ? major one in calculating the angle / direction of the space ship; the crew also finds the abandoned first mission space ship after seven years near the sun; there is another angle where the crew is attacked and killed by someone outside the crew member (I will not say by who!). As usual the crew keeps on dying one by one until the last survivor accomplishes the mission and in the end brings back sunshine to the earth.It is a totally foolish ride of sorts. I think young people who love fantasying about space would probably like the movie. I did not like the movie. The actors looked stupid talking seriously on space ship. The verbosity, clothes and body language of the crew looks as if they are performing on a road side stage act. Every 5 minutes in the movie the space ship is shown to remind us that this people are not working in a factory but on a space ship. The design of the space ship ? its proportions are left fully to the whimsical fantasy of creative department.Danny Boyle was a good comedy thriller director in early nineties and he has totally lost his touch of sorts. This venture of Danny after 4 years is a total disappointment.I would not mention the actors and actresses ? because they do not live any mark in your mind. The sun shots are really so bright in the theatre that they could be harmful to the retinas.The only worth mentioning thing was the last shot in the movie of the frozen harbor with back drop of Sydney Opera and sun shining again.(Stars 3 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This British made science fiction film is really dull and boring. The plot: we are in the mid 21st century and the sun is running out of fuel. To prevent it from dying out and thus freezing the Earth to death, a multinational (and strangely all young and photogenic) team of scientists is assembled to be send in a spaceship to the sun, in order to drop a couple of atom bombs that, it is hoped, will reignite the star. Unfortunately, during the mission, many problems ensue. This film was made on an evidently cheap budget - not by itself a problem, if the movie was interesting, which is not. Still, there are a couple of really bizarre scenes here that may well be worth the price of admission - a man literally touching the sun with his hands?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boyle really delivers but Garland doesn't (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sun is dying and earth has gradually been slipping more and more into eternal winter as a result. Scientists theorise that a nuclear payload delivered to the heart of the sun will create a new star within the dying core. The first mission to do this failed and years later Icarus II and its crew is approaching the sun with its nuclear payload the size of Manhattan island, seemingly representing the last hope for mankind. However the mission is full of risk and soon human factors of one sort or another come into play.Perhaps it is because it is a British film and has done wonders with a budget that most Hollywood sci-fi would consider a down payment, but for some reason Sunshine has rather been helped by lavish praise from British critics and viewers that it maybe doesn't deserve. This is understandable and I suppose is a good thing in a country more famous for dragging successful things down rather than anything else, however it isn't deserved as Sunshine is a mixed bag that isn't what it should have been. It all starts promisingly enough, with a quiet slow build from the start. The action is based on mistakes and pressure between the crew and appeared to be like a high concept disaster movie with the physiological element played up. So far so good then I thought but it is not long before it falls down somewhat with a plot twist that is too obvious and easy.I talk of course about the sudden introduction of the "crazed man taking out the crew one by one". It is a terrible last minute change of direction and makes little or no sense within the context of what had gone before. The general atmosphere created by Boyle up till then had done enough to buy it some goodwill and it still held my attention but it was hard to ignore how generic and dull it all felt. I do think the blame for this lies with the writer Garland as it does feel like he just was padding to this point or ran out of steam in the first half and tacked on a typical denouncement to create easy action. It is a real shame because Boyle did such good work as director to create a real tense atmosphere built on the subtle touches ? not the obvious or crass. His use of noise and clever visual touches are great and of course the visual effects are stunning (even without knowing how little it was all brought home for).The cast are mostly pretty good although you sense they could have done more if given more. There isn't really a lead role but if there is a star to come out of it then it is probably Evans, who does a great job and carries the film with his charisma and presence. Murphy's cold eyes and looks work really well in deep space, although I didn't think his character was that great. Curtis is wasted; his skin peals from exposure to the sun and while one of the crew dies all he cares abut is what is seen but yet we never get into his character. He is a good actor and I felt it was a waste of him. Garity, Sanadam and Byrne are used well in support but I did wonder why a global star like Yeoh bothered with such a small role.Overall then a mixed sci-fi that builds well before collapsing into an obvious final section that suggests lazy writing and an inability to rise about the derivative. It looks great and Boyle creates a great atmosphere throughout but it is the writing that lets him and the cast down at the end of the day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Beware Spoilers exist*Having read through some of the other reviews for this title, I have to wonder if we all watched the same movie. It has good visuals but its story and the underlying science it makes up to hold it up are extremely weak. The fact that we had to go to the movie website to find some of these explanations also makes me question the director's ability. A movie should be able to tell its story without requiring me as the viewer to go out of my way to find explanations for the things that don't make a lick of sense.Character development was almost non-existent, the chain of logic made no sense, and the attempt to create a scifi slasher was just bad. If it had been a purely scifi movie it would have done better than it did. But it tried to force a slasher into it, for no real reason. We already had a plot with the Sun acting almost in the role of antagonist, we didn't need a forced down our throats murderer to add onto it. Its as bad as that Lost in Space movie with Joey from Friends. Good visuals can't save this movie from a sub-standard plot and poor characters, that frankly I never managed to care for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with several of the other comments. In the end I was quite disappointed. There are many good points to this movie - strong cast, fine acting, outstanding special effects, well-built tension. All wasted at the end.A good, and possibly outstanding, movie for the first two-thirds, then an abrupt (and, in my opinion, poorly considered) jump into a horror story. The comparison to Event Horizon is particularly apt, and I'd add the Kubrick version of The Shining as well.The cinematography in Sunshine was riveting until the director started abusing quick cuts, deliberate blurs and other cheap effects. As an engineer I also had several serious problems with the science. Knowing something of CERN, I suspect the science adviser, Dr. Cox, was overruled by the writer on several occasions.(1) Unless I missed it, there was no mention of artificial gravity, yet it was certainly in use. Since the Icarus I was completely disabled, the Icarus II crew should have been floating about the passageways until power was restored. God only knows why re-pressurization altered the gravity - I don't.(2) Pinbacker, the Icarus I captain, had, as best I could tell, 3rd degree burns over his entire body. Somehow he survived for seven years and wasn't blind as a bat. Hmm.(3) Even a bomb the size of Manhattan made of, let's say, plutonium (and there isn't nearly that much plutonium on Earth) wouldn't create the gravity we see during the Pinbacker / Capa fight near the end.Sorry, don't buy it.Many posters seem to consider Danny Boyle to be a cinematic genius. Hope Sunshine isn't typical of his work. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a disappointingly dire effort from Danny Boyle, although the real culprit is the script which reminds one of those cheap, straight to video eighties Sci-Fi exploitation movies in terms of plot credibility. The constant references to other classic (or moderate, in the case of "Pitch Black") Sci-Fi movies frustratingly takes you out of the picture (Kubrick's monolith even turns up) and is a major miscalculation by the director. A little less trainspotting and a bit more sun shining out of your backside next time. Can ANYONE tell me what was happening in the last twenty minutes of this film? Bueller? The production designer may be aware of the layout of the ship and what goes where and how to drop the bomb, but you have to let the audience in on the secret. Not helpful is impossibly blurred and wavy impressionistic camera work.The most annoying aspect was that you didn't believe the people on board were astronauts. Buskers, maybe, but professionals? As two crewmen go outside the spaceship to do critical work, we hear them addressed: "Okay, guys, listen up." You just need to listen to the original moon landings or the crew of Apollo Thirteen saving themselves from disaster to shake your head. Obviously, for the purposes of drama on screen you are allowed a little leeway, but punch up's in the corridor before they're even half way there, vulgar language and put-downs, suicidal and unstable personalities and inexplicable loss of bottle at unhelpful moments makes for an eye-rolling experience. Okay, so a couple of these slackers do eventually produce a bit of "the right stuff", but by then we're too bored (not to mention confused) to care.It's a pity, because inside this rambling mess is a germ of an idea trying to get out. We see the sun as our friend - "what a lovely day" - and the beginning of the movie captures a terrifying vulnerability as it becomes our powerful, lonely nemesis.If you're going to "Sunshine", take at least a twenty five sunblock to guard against blistering, skin peeling clichés. Splash it all over, Henry (or Henrietta.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls apart by the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not bad, but I certainly expected better considering the raves coming out of Britain back when it was released last spring. I like Boyle as a director, and his work is mostly quite good here. The movie is your pretty standard one about a group of astronauts in space on a mission (here heading for the dying sun to reignite it with a nuclear payload). 2001: A Space Odyssey is most frequently mentioned as the movie's major forbearer, but it reminded me much more of Alien. Most of the characters will die one way or another. We can guess that from the start. For most of the film, Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland (who also worked with Boyle on the far superior 28 Days Later?) keep up a nice amount of suspense. It's never very believable, but it's entertaining enough. The production design is especially awesome to look at. As almost everyone outside of the demographic of British guys aged 14-30 can tell you, Sunshine takes a wrong turn at about the two-thirds mark. The film has always been sort of a horror movie up to this point, but then they basically introduce a monster into the mix. Now, I personally don't mind this addition. It doesn't ruin the movie for me. But Boyle and Garland blow their wad way too fast on the foreign intruder. It would have worked better to drag this segment out a little more, creating suspense instead of turning the movie into a dull slasher. So, yeah, they make a big mistake. But to add insult to injury, they don't stop the screw-ups there: Boyle decides to edit the film like an utter maniac at this point. I guess he wanted to give the film a fragmented, more tense tone in this final section, but all he has really succeeded at doing is making it so annoying that it borders on intolerable. I don't think I'm alone in saying I pretty much threw my hands up during the final couple of scenes, trying to figure out what the heck was going on (in fact, I know I'm not alone, given the similar opinions of the two people who watched it with me). It's a disappointment in the end. It was going so well early on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Massive Spoiler Alert: But can you really spoil a movie these days? You're gently guided through one stereotype and cliché after another, so as not to wake you from your lifelong delusional daydream.The Logic (or lack thereof): Remember it's science fiction not logic fiction, so I will accept only nonsense like the ships being in the suns orbit with just some shield protecting them. But: 1. Why do so many people have to go there and back? 2. Bombs are "payload"? Why not "cargo" or "bomb"? Makes you wonder which billionaire was kind enough to PAY for saving mankind. 3. The so-called Scientists are a chaotic bunch. 4. The ship's computer is "Ikarus" - oh how "clever", that is for half-schooled dimwits - remember that Ikarus' wings melted in the sun. By that logic you could call the ship "Challenger", "Solar 13", "Hindenburg" etc. 5. Who was the mystery man? Suddenly after 90 minutes it's a mystery tale? That was under-explained and only construed in order to have the plot go on. 6. There is no computing of the course correction - just one hysterical guy with a calculator - well it's just a setup for having to find the 1st mission. 7. The first ships inside is entirely covered in dust. They say "dust is 85% skin". Well, then let's calculate (once again...) that thick layer of dust: 0.5 kg skin per year - that's about 5 kg per year for the entire crew. So either no one was wiping the floors for 10 years or they still shed skin long after they were dead. Was it a crew of 10.000 people? The secret is never revealed. 8. The light takes 8 minutes to the Earth: Our hero's sister watches his message (which he sent long ago) of what's to be seen if the mission was successful. Then she positions herself JUST IN TIME when the sun "lights up". Come on! There is still logic though: in one scene the wrists are slashed the correct way (that is one of the few "Boyle" moments of realism).Political Correctness: 1. A multi-cultural crew and they also save a dying star. How sweet it is. 2. Only Caucasians fight amongst themselves but survive the longest. Is that P.C.? 3. No people of African origin among the crew. Very non-P.C. Sci Fi Clichés galore: 1. There's oxygen for some but not all of them. 2. 3 guys on a forced spacewalk but only one space suit. 3. Going to search the lost Mission is a terrible risk but of course through absolute coincidence they eventually HAVE to do that. 4. The "repair in space" scene with the expected self-sacrifice of one. 5. There is a countdown scene. They are running out of oxygen - yet they move around in cathedral-sized surroundings. If they were so short of oxygen (all of a sudden and conveniently there are no plants) why not use oxygen masks and SAVE some. Remember: It's the ecosphere, stupid! Do I have to spell it for you? Those golden space suits are a sight to behold. A mix of R2D2 and the best/worst 1950s Sci-Fi-Flicks thrown together. No one laughed which I found hard to understand. So at least once I was surprised in this movie.We also have an interesting crew of selected scientists (for a mission so important): There's an aloof, Jesus-type Hippie, who must impress somebody. Otherwise he wouldn't be in movies. There's an American jock who is always in an immature fight usually with the only other Caucasian male aboard. It's like a bad 1980s High School movie. There's a pouting 20-something girl - so she left earth when she was a teenager. A scientist teenager, mind you. There's a Japanese commander (very P.C.) with broken English (fffantastic to have a non native speaker as your leader when you're dealing with the existence of Earth) There's a hysterical Chinese fellow who's calculating skills are flawed but who nevertheless doesn't bother any of the surely impressive COMPUTERS on board to do life-or-death course corrections. All in all they are a great representation of mankind to save itself: Fighting like teenagers but since the audience will be mostly teenage I get the point. Well, like teenagers no one really decides - they rather argue aimlessly and their "decisions" are usually coming from facts outside their own making.I have no idea about the ending &amp; by that time I didn't care. Nothing could save this oeuvre in the last 5 minutes. There is no empathy that you could build during the course of the film. If you take a flawed, naive film like "Silent Running": at least you could feel anything about that guy and his Huey and Dewey computers hobbling around. But if you like "Event Horizon" you will surely like this film. So this is a "solid" Sci-Fi-Film? First of all solid seems to mean clichéd and repetitive. Not so, since real Sci-Fi it offers endless - virtually endless possibilities. If you have the time read Stanislaw Lem, Isaac Asimov, etc. Why writers and directors never use that endless realm of ideas or are prevented from doing so is beyond me.This instead is run of the mill "Science Fiction" (Hollywood's understanding thereof, mind you). If I get the point it is trying to make, then this is inept pretentiousness at its worst. You get what you expect. Your Popcorn is fresher than the ideas in this movie.I've stopped expecting to be impressed or entertained by movies as they were intended. Instead I view them as (involuntary) comedy. Still after a while I just got angry and started counting the inconsistencies and clichés among the obligatory hoopla, explosions and deafening sound. A lot could be said about current cinema playing to the masses of naive, dumbed down movie-goers in the hope of creating a blockbuster. But others have done that before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of science fiction I decided to take a chance on this film when I saw it in the three pound bargain section at HMV. I am glad that I decided to get it as it is a good film. There are no big name Hollywood stars in although this isn't a bad thing as it meant each character is equally important rather than having one main character who we know will survive to the end while the others die around him.Set in 2057 when for some reason the sun is dying and the Earth is freezing a group of eight people are on a mission to deliver a huge bomb to the Sun in order to restart the dying star. Their ship, the Icarus II, is the second ship to undertake this mission, the first disappeared without a trace seven years earlier. As our crew pass Mercury they hear a distress signal coming from the missing ship. They decide to alter course to retrieve the bomb from that ship so as to double their chances of success. Unfortunately due to a mistake while changing course the shielding is damaged and the garden which produces oxygen for the crew is destroyed. Things get even worse for them after they dock with the first Icarus and they pick up an unexpected and unwelcome guest.The acting seemed fairly solid and the story got fairly creepy towards the end as one would hope for in a film of this type. The special effects were great, I strongly recommend watching it in a darkened room on a fairly big screen so you can really appreciate the brightness of the scenes where they are in direct sunlight. There are obvious similarities to other sci-fi films, I was reminded of Alien in an early scene where the crew were sat around a table and the ending had clear similarities with Event Horizon, this isn't a negative thing though, I don't think there is anything wrong with similarities to other films so long as the story is good and executed well. I'd definitely recommend this film to science fiction fans, especially if it is in the bargain bin or on television.</fullReview>

Danny Boyle's preparation for this Film was shown by the quality of the performances.

		<shortDescription>Short on ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been a lot of positive reviews for this film, but I suspect that these are from people who aren't that familiar with classic sci-fi. My impression of 'Sunshine' was that it is devoid of new ideas and just cherry picks from other much superior films from the past 40 years. Take a pinch of '2001,' chuck in a bit of 'Alien' and a drop of 'Event Horizon' and then simmer with assorted bits and pieces from a dozen other films and you get this mess. It would be bearable if the film knew its place. but it has pretensions way beyond what it delivers. Boyle did pretty much the same thing with '28 Days Later' and (sort of) got away with it because that film was low-budget and low-pretension and quite fun, whereas 'Sunshine' strives for an epic quality that ends up as meaningless drivel. The switch from sci-fi adventure to 'horror-in-space' two-thirds of the way through is particularly jarring and seemed to be pandering to the popcorn brigade.Two marks for special effects, but sfx do not a great film make. Overall a disappointment, but not a surprise.</fullReview>

However, I feel that there are far too many scenes with bright lights which makes my eyes tired.The portrayal of how unscrupulous people can be when it comes to your own survival is raw and real. Some scenes portray graphic violence and I find it really scary! The soundtrack is excellent. It gives an upbeat and futuristic feeling to the film. I really like the way it alternates from explosion sounds to music at the end scene, I think it gives us an insight into the state of mind of the astronauts: serenity and accomplishment despite the surrounding chaos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a clever science-fiction movie again that works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been some (unsuccesful) attempts the past few years (such as "Solaris" and "Mission to Mars".) but lets face it, science-fiction movies now days mostly means flying space ships constantly battling each other and freaky looking aliens who try to take over the world, instead of the deeper and more philosophical approach. Nothing wrong with that sort of entertainment but it's refreshing to see that still good and clever science-fiction movies can be made, combined with the techniques of this decade. It really makes "Sunshine" one of the best science-fiction movies since years and I was pleasantly surprised by it.The movie features basically every cliché you can think of with this genre and it of course also makes the movie in parts predictable but it does a good job with combining it all and it works out really well thanks to the lively and original directing from Danny Boyle that is somewhere between spectacular and philosophical but always in its own style. The movie is a great blend between tense and spectacular action and clever written moments. This movie picks all kind of approaches from mystery, to tension, to action and it all works out effectively.Basically this movie has everything in it it needs to make a great movie with. It's tense, spectacular looking, has a mysterious theme in it and a sniff of romance. In other words; all the ingredients to have a great time with. It's a movie that entertains and thrills and is a feast for all your senses.The movie is incredible good looking. Outer space has never looked so impressive and huge before. The visual effects are amazing and in a way also are the core of the movie. The special effects are everywhere, the establishing shots, the spectacular moments, the beautiful moments. They are just basically always present and a reason why this movie works out so well is because of its visual look, in which the special effects play such an important part. It of course can be all best experienced on the big screen.Has there ever been a movie before in which the sun played such a prominent role? It almost becomes a character in the movie and it of course plays the biggest part in the movie, since it's all about the sun. In fact the story isn't really that much special or even original but the approach of it all makes this movie a refreshing one nevertheless, that is a great one to experience. How much things can you actually come up with, with a group of astronauts aboard a space ship on mission to re-ignite the dying sun. The movie comes up with some really well thought out and executed moments, that really are some edge-of-your-seat stuff at times. It's a greatly layered movie with themes in that can be interpreted in many different deeper ways, though it's also true that the movie toward the end becomes more formulaic and picks the more simplistic approach. And yes, it's definitely true that the movie is not terribly original with its themes and characters but nevertheless the execution and especially the visual look of it all still makes this movie one that is worth seeing, even if you've already seen all of the science-fiction movies this movie obviously was inspired by (such as "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Alien".). The movie really isn't the most original one but yet it feels like a totally new experience.What I also love about the movie is that it does a good job at not picking one main character but instead focus evenly on all the characters aboard the space ship, even though you can say that Cillian Murphy plays the main character of the movie. It gives everyone a lot of screen time and doesn't really make any of them a secondary character for in the background with meaningless lines. It also makes all of the characters well developed, despite the fact that they all are quite formulaic. Also a reason why their characters work out is because of the top-class acting, from some well known but also lesser known actors. Not one actor in the movie disappoints and they all did a great job. It shows that Danny Boyle is a real actor-directing but also a director who knows how to tell a story without the actors but with lots of style and flair.A great, mysterious, tense, spectacular but above all also really well made beautiful movie experience that you really have to experience for your self.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrealistic, boring and definitely overrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank God I didn't pay to watch this movie, otherwise I would be very angry! I won free tickets to watch this movie (it was a promotion from a phone operator here in Portugal) but now that I already did it I realized it didn't even worth the time I spent on the ticket line to get the free tickets! That said, let me explain why?The plot is too straight: it's just the mission to re-ignite the Sun. The setting is always the same: the Spaceship. It's deeply boring! But what is the worst thing of all is that the director, to fight this predictable boredom, thought it would be nice to "inject" some cheap drama and very doubtful suspense? I used the word "inject" because I think it's done in a very forced way? Especially the part related to drama. It's too melodramatic and without any sense to a movie like this, or at least what I thought it was: a Sci-fi film! On the other hand, I found this movie a bit unrealistic too, because I suppose (and I don't know anything about Astronomy and/or Physics?) that would be necessary a much more advanced/sophisticated technology to reach so close to the Sun, and resist its heat, than the one which was presented in the movie. I can't talk with scientific precision, but it all seemed a bit archaic to me!What was good in the movie was, basically, its original idea (which was totally wasted, I must say!) and some good Sci-fi visual effects. All the rest was pretty bad!</fullReview>

The introduction of the crazy Russian killer astronaut completely ruined the film for me. Up until that point I found myself being very involved in the on screen action and I couldn't look away because it was so good. Then the run-of-the-mill monster killer came into play and all the good work was flushed down the toilet.But take it from me, the movie up till then is very good and it is worth a watch anyway. If anything, this film is an educational experience for any young wannabe film makers. Watch it and see how good it COULD have been, then work out what went wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would appear that maybe one, lonely, spiteful person has written all the negative reviews of Sunshine. With the constant banging of the "anti-hippy" drum the discerning reader will have noticed a theme: an utter intolerance and disdain for movies that lack loud explosions. Sunshine is not a masterpiece, and at times can be somewhat leaden. That happens, and expecting any sci-fi film to age well is asking a lot. What this movie does provide is a science fiction theme that does not deal with invading aliens and things that go "boom" but instead some deeper, more heartfelt issues. Yes, the soundtrack seems quite quaint but how well will "Armageddon's" soundtrack hold up in 2030? I'll make it simple: if you want to see a lost sci-fi film with an original plot, interesting effects and don't mind having to do a little THINKING you might enjoy Sunshine. If this sounds awful to you, please rent "Armageddon" instead and turn your stereo up nice and loud.If you're sleepy and want a nap, there are several options available to you: counting sheep, taking a sleeping pill, or perhaps watching Sunshine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who paid attention to the clues given during the movie could solve this "mystery" way before they wanted to enlighten us. This movie was supposed to be an intelligent thriller, but it isn't much more than a slasher movie in disguise.After leaving the movie theater I couldn't feel anymore foolish for staying til the end. I can't believe I spent my money and time watching this movie. I wish I could get my money back, no I wish I could bet the time wasted back.As far as the story goes..., there is no story. I mean, I verbally announced every scene of this movie before it happened. It was all so obvious. There was nothing original about this at all. Not only was it not innovative, but it was very predictable. The acting was terrible. I honestly can't tell if it was the acting that was so bad or the script. I think it's a heavy mixture of both. There was no direction at all. It's like they gave the actors this lame script and told them to go with it. It looked like it could have been filmed in one day. Editing and all. It was pathetic and a disservice to all Sci-Fi moves and the people who sat through it. The camera angles were really bad. I mean bad. It was somewhat distracting as well. Overall, this was the worst movie I've ever seen. I can't believe I found myself watching it. I have no clue what I was thinking. I guess I thought it was going to be this cool Sci-Fi movie, but I really had that wrong. I'm sure all of the actors that participated in it would rather forget that they did.

Because at the end we were all given free vouchers to another movie as an apology.

		<fullReview>My main problem with this film is that it attempts to be "hard" science fiction, but it gets all the facts wrong. It also borrows a lot from older films of the genre and has inconsistencies and gaping plot holes. In fact this disturbed me so much that my enjoyment of "Sunshine" (a visually pleasing film) was affected in a negative way.- Help! The sun's light is fading! Hm - strange, since it's a scientific fact that the intensity of the light from the sun is increasing by 10% every one million years.-"We've mined all the earth's fissile materials" oh really!? A lot. I mean... A lot!!! Considering the fact that there is more fissile material than tin (a fairly common metal) in the earth's crust. At least ten to the power of seventeen kilos. I also wonder how they calculated the mass of Manhattan. Is there some kind of consensus on that... Makes you wonder how they got it all up there in the first place. And why would you want fissile material anyway? The sun works by FUSION.-Apparently, the sun makes a loud sort of rumbling, swooshing sound when it burns. How strange. There is no air in space to conduct the sound waves. This sound can also be heard very clearly inside the space ship for some reason... But only in the room where you can watch the sun.-The sun destroys one of the antennae of the ship in the blink of an eye, but mercury just sits there without being affected at all.-The solar wind prevents the crew from sending messages. But the distress signal from the other ship can be heard very clearly (for some reason it is a silly, meaningless synthesizer sound) -The name of the ship is Icarus II. You know - the guy who flew too close to the sun so his wings melted, and he crashed to his doom. Perhaps they should have called it "Titanic II" instead to bring less ill omens to the crew.-It is comforting to know that psychology has been exposed as the pseudo-science that it is, 50 years into the future. But perhaps the captain of Icarus I (?) should have stayed on his schizo meds for the ENTIRE trip so he could suppress his urge to be "alone with God" Behold now the thievery (only partially exposed) -Crew boards spooky ghost vessel causing pinhead type villain: EVENT HORIZON (pinhead villain already stolen from horror classic in the first place) -Space walk without space-suits while shot out of airlock: 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY This could go on and on. But I think this IMDb rating is much too high. It is sad that the script is so bad, considering how ambitiously it has been executed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping, Handsomely Shot, Philosophical Sci-Fi Movie Let Down By A Lacklustre Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sun is giving out and the Earth is dying. In a last ditch effort to save humanity the spacecraft Icarus II is launched with a nuclear bomb on board designed to restart the Sun. Can the crew deliver their payload, and what happened to the preceding mission ?For most of its running time, this is a pretty good grown-up science-fiction flick. Okay so the premise takes some swallowing and it's a little derivative of some other films (notably Dark Star and 2010), but it's all good stuff - tense, interesting, well acted by the no-star cast, and full of terrific shots of the ship and its environs. Boyle has a bit of a tendency to go for sudden jarring cuts and off-putting sound effects, but mostly his direction is taut and there are some bravura moments, like the subliminal images of the dead crew when our heroes enter the dusty Icarus I. I have a big problem with this movie though, and it's the Pinbacker character, whom we are asked to believe went crazy, killed his shipmates, waited around for seven years and sneaked through an airlock into our guys' ship whilst nobody was looking. Sorry, but that sucks. Instead of pursuing the mission story with the gravitas it deserves, it's an excuse to have a psycho (who looks like a bad Freddy Krueger knock-off) run around the ship attacking people for no reason. Writer Alex Garland has plenty of good ideas in his script, but spoils them with this tomfoolery. That aside though, there are plenty of interesting scenes, even if the characters aren't particularly noteworthy. For the record, our Sun is due to fail in about a billion years (the movie wisely avoids stating when it's set), and it will go the other way - turn red giant and burn us up. This is an enjoyable modern sci-fi adventure though, and another notch in the oeuvre of Boyle, who, along with Ang Lee, is perhaps the most diverse director since Howard Hawks. Shot on terrific sets at Three Mills Studios at Bow in east London.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imperfect but still nifty science fiction thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few million years from now the Sun will burn out and the Earth will freeze up so long and hard not even cockroaches will survive. Sunshine speeds up the process to a few decades from now, which is probably for the best on dramatic terms but does rather tamp down the cosmic immensity of the concept. Still, its nice to see a film with an end of the world scenario that doesn't wallow in CGI laden destruction sequences or that particularly irritating type of contrived human drama where neglectful spouses/parents learn lessons through adversity. Sunshine keeps its head in the stars, with an affecting sense of wonder and some sweet visuals. It also happily avoids forcing reams of expository dialogue or clunking techno-babble on the audience, opting for a more realistic approach in which the characters know what they're doing and don't have to explain it. Things follow a pretty standard pattern of smart and resourceful heroes putting everything on the line to save humanity from disaster, with all the expected tensions and hiccups along the way. Actually the tensions were one of the problems I had with the film, despite being it would seem, the cream of the crop when it comes to astronauts and scientists, the crew of Sunshine are prone to the most predictable of fears and squabbles and it just doesn't really ring true. Surely a mission as grave as this would have the most strenuous of psychological training, wouldn't the team be above this? Seemingly not, and so the character interactions can be unfortunately eye-rolling at times. There is towards the end arguably some explanation for this but it isn't very well worked out, a notion of human fragility up against immense force that leads to ill thought out and tiresome sub Event Horizon horror hi-jinks. The cast draw the film nicely through its problematic patches though, an eclectic mixture of British, US and Asian personnel (with the Asians underused), everyone is generally workmanlike rather than sparkling but they convince well enough, with Cillian Murphy standing out as enigmatic everyman Capa. The effects work and visuals are worth a look for fans of spectacle as well, a nice mixture of model work and CGI for spacecraft, a cold and realistic look to the interiors and a sense of glory in the pounding light of the sun. It all comes across as watchable and occasionally intense, but its unfortunate that the film tries to be a bit more than just a blockbuster because it just isn't smart enough. Still worth a look for science fiction enthusiasts, just don't expect a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just turns into another horror Sci-fi...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am increasingly wary of watching sci-fi movies these days. There is a trend that sci-fi movies are just horror movie set in a future time. Sometimes this works well - like Alien and Aliens - but the repetitive nature of this is now wearing thin and shows a lack of imagination by writers.Sadly this movie falls into this trap, mixed with religious overlay. I was just waiting for the 'horror' part - hoping I would be wrong - and yawn, there it was...in all predictability...a lurking villain...not picked up by sensors (huh? - I would be asking for a refund from the sensor company!). It is an understatement to say that such a predicable storyline development is an insult to viewers. It ruined what was potentially good movie.The intelligence of the character development shows considerable weakness. Somehow you get the idea that the writer is thinking the characters were just spending a few weeks on a nice Pacific Island - not an tough, long, demanding trip to the sun. Most of the characters would have been eliminated in basic psychology tests. Also the characters youngish ages showed they would not have the maturity expected of such a mission. Both of these points (and others) showed that the writer had a poor understanding of space travel, and sci-fi in general. Hence, one can only conclude that the intent of the writer was to develop a horror film (of sorts) on a loose sci-fi background.Furthermore, the script showed a poor extrapolation of technology growth. Would really the space walk be done by humans in gold space suits in 2057? Somehow, such a difficult requirement would have been mastered by robot. One can only assume the idea to use humans was to remove a cast member. How original...So 3 out of 10...simply because the cast tries their best with a poor script and weak storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are easily excitable and have trouble getting to sleep just pop this snoozer in to your DVD and you'll be asleep in no time.There's no plot. The dialog is almost as interesting as listening to rust form. The "story" seems to have happened in a previous episode. There's no explanation of why anything is happening so you don't really care. The characters are less than one dimensional, they're just little dots you don't care about nor do you want to listen to them speak because you know they won't say anything interesting.I think the writer of this film must be a vampire because he sucked the life out of what could have been a really interesting story.

		<fullReview>From the 1st five minutes of this movie you know that the 'pretty boy white actor' aka Cillian Murphy will be the last character standing and will save the world. Hollywood can never seem to break out of this mold in most action films of any sort. And the dead giveaway, he gets the voice over part in the beginning and is the only crew member to get to send a video home.I was thrilled to see some ethnic diversity in having 3 Asian main characters but you were pretty aware in what order most people would be killed off on this mission. They did not make it to the last three characters standing. No surprises from Hollywood there.There was no reason to care about the characters, almost no character development for any of them, and inconsistent actions by the characters. Plenty of overwrought action, occasional macho power trips and endless blowing up/destruction of things. This doesn't really do it for me so overall I was bored and couldn't wait for it to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sunshine has amazing visuals, really, really nicely done. But it is sole quality of the movie unfortunately.The movie is sometimes compared to Aliens, but the comparison seriously fails. There was a bunch of quite normal people on board of Nostromo, you know, "space truckers" without much motivation for heroism. However they are able to cooperate as a team when things went bad and it there was not an robot and computer willing to sacrifice the crew, they had chance to win.On the board of the Save-The-Sun-2" ship which is "the most important mission for the mankind" is bunch of the "brightest" sociopaths who do not seem to operate the ship properly, do one bad decision after another and they are not able to cooperate in general.So they decide to visit Save-The-Sun-1 ship for illogical reasons (why to proceed according the plan if you can screw it by your intuition?) and start their own version of "A Series of Unfortunate Evens". 'Of course, if they would proceed according to the plan, there would be simple and successful mission and no cheap, simple and stupid thriller. But the series of stupid decisions is way too long to be taken seriously so every following thrill somewhat loses its edge and the whole movie starts to be boring.In the end it is more about "people who die in a beautiful manner by completely unnecessary deaths". I can swallow the bizarre premise of the "bomb which can lit the Sun", but the train of stupidity here is way too long and too painful to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good sci-fi effects but lacking in story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunshine has some great effects and visuals- they are definitely stunning throughout the film, but the story just wasn't catching my attention. I felt bored through most of the film. The plot seemed relatively simple. Astronaunts and scientists go into space to drop a nuclear payload into the sun (which is dying in a few billion years!). I enjoyed the scenery for what it is, and the cast did a decent job. There happened to be a few mistakes though. Part of the ship is damaged, and the crew find out the first ship which sent out to complete their current mission is still floating around. So they decided to try and fix it. The characters weren't really the problem- they were typical but none didn't really stand out. Though, I liked Chris Evans character the best. He stole the show in this film and I thought was the best part. Although, I really don't understand why their were Asians included the cast. I felt like it took away from the film. I actually enjoyed the ending (last 30 mins) of the film. It is more slightly a slasher film but it was pretty entertaining- definitely more fun and engaging than the previous parts. It starts around 65:30, and ends until the film ends. Overall the film has its moments but nothing really to get excited about. Not an underrated film like others have claimed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry for my English it is true that the sights of space are splendid, but besides that, it has nothing there. impossible to know where they are compared to the sun, even at the end when they are in orbit. at the time of the final trick (species of combat do I suppose), that moves so much that you distinguish anything neither the characters nor the decoration (that does close to the bomb but where? you really do not know where you are). in a vessel spacial, it is necessary to recreate weightlessness. out they are in their vessel or that of the first mission (disappeared since more than 6 years) there is always weightlessness. at the beginning of film, we see the simulation of the process of dropping of the bomb towards the sun. in this process, the vessel separates from the protective shield, the first turns over towards the ground, the second share towards the sun. actually, we see that, when the vessel is not protected any more by the shield, it is destroyed by the rays of the sun as that is to unroll during a change of course. thus even if if very had happened as envisaged, they would have died with the explosion of the vessel bus of 1 they would not have had a protective shield of 2 more they would have to face a new sun. finally, the sun is presented like the resource vital of the ground, but is also an enormous source of energy. they have a gigantic shield which could provide energy sufficient to go it to make move the vessel but instead of that they use an engine which break down as soon as it is not cooled any more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the *bleep* happened with the ending?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is sadly representative of a persistent weakness in modern filmmaking. It's a pretty good story right up until an ending that blows massive chunks. Jiminy Tap Dancing Christmas, the ending of this movie is so putrid it would choke an unwashed skunk.Implausibly set 50 years in the future, this movie begins with the Sun dying. After the first mission to reignite the star with a gigantic stellar bomb disappears, a second ship and crew is sent with the all the remaining fissile material on Earth to make one final effort to save the Solar System and Humanity. On board the Icarus II is a refreshingly uncolorful crew of 8 astronauts. There's the taciturn Captain Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada), his weak and wavering second-in-command Harvey (Troy Garity), stellar bomb-designing physicist Capa (Cillian Murphy), pilot and Capa's sort-of girlfriend Cassie (Rose Byrne), take charge engineer Mace (Chris Evans), earth-mother-in-space Corazon (Michelle Yeoh), mission psychiatrist and weirdo Searle (Cliff Curtis) and whiny plot-device Trey (Benedict Wong).On their way to the Sun, the crew of the Icarus II discover that the first ship sent on this mission was not mysteriously destroyed but is even more mysteriously in perfect solar orbit. The decision to continue on with the mission or change course to rendezvous with the Icarus I is left up to the supposedly smartest guy on board. Capa's decision to rendezvous, while completely reasonable, sets the Icarus II on a course of accident, tragedy and death before culminating in an ending that will make you want to throw something at your television.It's very unfortunate that Sunshine ends so poorly because it's quite entertaining and even compelling up to that point. It largely eschews cheap melodrama and the whole Sun-dying thing is treated like a Mcguffin, so there's very little pointless techobabble. This is really a tale about the relentless and inescapable dangers of spaceflight and the terrible pressures and situations space travelers must deal with. It's about how if you make one wrong decision or a single mistake in space, it will lead to one problem after another after another until events crescendo beyond your control and you're utterly screwed. But the challenges that face the crew of the Icarus II don't occur because the Almighty Plot Hammer needs them to occur. They believably and logically happen because normal people occasionally make bad judgments or little mistakes or forget one tiny thing. Up until its gosh darned conclusion, Sunshine tells an exciting story of people struggling against impossible odds to accomplish the absolutely necessary.This movie also looks really good. It combines the modern style of movie space ships that look like they come right out of a NASA design conference with the prettier, more striking and more stylized look embodied by 2001: A Space Odyssey. Director Danny Boyle also does a fine job showing off how great everything looks.Acting-wise, Chris Evans gives the standout performance as Mace, outshining Cillian Murphy in what I guess is the lead role of Capa. I have to guess at that because while Capa seems to be the main character in the story, he's extremely passive and mostly stands around looking full of angst while the other characters do everything. I'm not sure Murphy is the right guy to be a leading man, but I don't think anyone could have done very much with the role of Capa. What's most interesting about the acting is how these characters aren't quirky or eccentric or larger than life. Instead, they're straight laced, buttoned down and mostly unemotional. But realistically, the people entrusted with the future of Mankind would have to be straight laced, buttoned down and mostly unemotional. The script and the cast deserve a lot of credit for embracing the task of making these more ordinary people grab your attention and sympathy and hold onto it. Or at least keep a hold of it until the spectacularly ill-conceived climax.As for that ending, I really don't want to spoil it for you. It's so elephant-staggeringly bad that if you do decide to watch Sunshine, I want you to be able to appreciate its vomitous nature with a clear head. I will leave you with one analogy. Imagine if in the ending of Godfather II, Fredo had been eaten by a giant shark. That's how bad the conclusion of Sunshine is.I'm torn on recommending you see this film or not. The most of it that's good is thoroughly enjoyable. The final segment is so terrible, however, it almost retroactively invalidates everything that comes before it. If you're someone who enjoys the journey more than reaching a destination, give Sunshine a try. If you're someone who cares about how everything ends up, avoid this movie like the plague.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorly Conceived Student yarn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched Sunshine twice and I've noted the similarities between this film and PWSA's earlier film but it wasn't until watching Event Horizon and reading about William Malones' unmade Dead Star script (which became Supernova)again that this film basically takes an idea that was done 10 or so years ago twice and doesn't do it with much suspense. I can't have been the only person that from about the first mention of the missing captain it occurred that the twist was basically going to be that the captain is alive and will have gone mad. You then have to sit through about an hour of fairly boring pointless scenes that are trying really hard to be trippy and disturbing before the captain tuns up. You then get a replay of the last 30 or so minutes of Event Horizon before a feel good ending that the supposedly more mainstream American film made 10 years earlier managed to avoid.A bad film and a waste of budget if their ever was one. I don't see what really differentiates this from Event Horizon other than a few tweaks in the plot, a worse looking ship, worse actors, a worse concept (black holes leading to different dimensions is almost the ultimate nightmare, being close to the sun isn't that scary) and much less scary. One other problem I had with a this film is rather than seeming like the subject matter, they more seem like a bunch of students hanging around and messing about a flat. Event horizon for all it's flaws felt like a group of Space Marines trapped light years away from earth with a Evil force stalking them at every moment. This felt like a few days in boring student flat with a few stalker element thrown in at the end. Danny Boyle hasn't shown himself to be a really capable director in my opinion, The Beach had similar flaws as did parts of 28 Days later. It's a shame because his films do have good ideas, it's just that they're plagiarised and surrounded by by bits that are really poorly conceived.Go watch Event Horizon, a better conceived version of the unmade Deadstar script which is very unnerving and is held together by a strong performance by Sam Neil. It's strange that this is actually a time when Hollywood did it better. Of course the best spooky Sci-Fi film is Solaris directed by Andrei Tarkovsky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danny Boyle makes two thirds (three quarters?) of one of the great scifi films.The plot of the film has a group of scientists on a ship heading to the sun to drop a bomb that will reignite its dying core. This is a follow up to a mission that had failed seven years earlier. as they approach Mercury and prepare for the final push to the drop off point they run into some unexpected twists. First they discover the ship that preceded them is still in orbit around the sun and then things begin to go wrong.I love the look of this film.I love the sound of this film. The marriage of sound and pictures is breath taking. Boyle and his crew have created a classic film look. Its stunning. To be fair I was so awash in sound and image that I missed a couple of plot points. Oh to see this in High Def.The cast that includes Cillian Murphy and Michelle Yeoh is first rate. I don't think there is a false note or false moment in the bunch. Here we have a bunch of flawed individuals who are trying very hard to literally save the world and not lose their humanity in the process.And for most of the films running time the script seems to be damn near perfect. We have a really good story that carries you away because its interesting, its well told and we have characters that we care about. Up to a certain point in the film things seemed to be heading towards one of the truly classic scifi films of all time. The problem is that something happens which really doesn't work. I can't get into it since there is a spoiler of the "kill the person who told you" sort. It doesn't kill the film but it does hobble it enough that it keeps it from going into that all time great category. (Of course when I see this again-and I will do so repeatedly, I may change my mind.) Is it worth seeing? Yes. a big screen of some sort would be very nice. I'm guessing that odds are you're going to love the drama of the story. I think that you may end up disappointed that it wobbles toward the end, but its till say two thirds or more of a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been putting off watching Sunshine for ages, believing it to be nothing more than an overblown, CGI packed, 'disaster/end of humanity' film along the lines of Armageddon. Having just finished the film, I can report that, although there are plenty of CGI effects, Sunshine is nothing of the sort: it's actually a boring, pretentious, and sober piece of 'serious' sci-fi that makes little or no sense?one that makes me almost wish I'd popped Michael Bay's asteroid crap-fest in my DVD player instead.The film starts off promisingly enough, with the crew of the spacecraft Icarus II killing time until they arrive at their destination, the Sun, where they hope to 'restart' the dying star by dropping a massive bomb into its heart. Things starts to go 'tits-up', however, once the crew discover the remains of a previous failed mission and attempt to recover its payload (in order to double their chances of success); at this point, Sunshine gradually becomes nothing more than a glut of confusing special effects designed to mask the fact that the script has become an indecipherable mess.In fact, Sunshine is so bad, I find it almost impossible to believe that it came from the same man that gave us the excellent 28 Days Later, and who would, soon after, receive the Academy Award for Best Director. It's a strange old world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danny Boyle's "Sunshine" has a powerful &amp; compelling plot, breathtakingly stunning visual effects, masterful scenery and a constantly high level of suspense ? yet; it nevertheless remains an "ordinary" and "prototypic" Sci-Fi movie. Boyle almost single-handedly recreated the extinct zombie genre with his previous film "28 Days Later", so quite a large number of fans ? myself definitely included ? expected that he would at least try and provide the dying Sci-Fi/disaster genre with a few new twists and touches but, most unfortunately, Boyle and his regular writer Alex Garland merely restrict themselves here to the recycling of vintage ideas and classic bits that already featured in Sci-Fi landmarks such as "2001: A Space Odyssey", "Alien", "Star Trek" and "Solaris". The whole thing is extremely professionally acted and directed, but the truly ingenious and nifty aspects can be count on the fingers of just one hand. In fact the only really unpredictable surprise-twist, which comes very near to the end and all of a sudden practically turns "Sunshine" in a brainless slasher picture, is a very foolish and inconsiderate one that nearly brings down the credibility of the entire production. In the not-so distant future, barely fifty years from now, the sun is slowly but surely dying and hence the days of our own planet are numbered as well. The Icarus II, with its eight-headed crew of scientists, mathematicians and even psychiatrists, go on a mission to literally reboot the sun with a nuclear bomb, but they quickly face gigantic obstacles like mechanical defects, mutual conflicts and ? the utmost absurd obstacle of all ? a confrontation with what's left of Icarus I. As the number of astronauts decreases, the more insurmountable their mission becomes.One of the main reasons why classic Sci-Fi milestones such as "Alien" and "2001" were so effective is because of their convincing character drawings. When I first watched "Alien", at too young age I must admit, I was literally convinced these people were real astronauts. It's been far too long since we had a Sci-Fi movie with a truly convincing cast and even "Sunshine" fails to deliver in this department. Actually, the characters in "Sunshine" are oppositely implausible to those in "Armageddon". The earth's saviors there were a bunch of foul and loud-mouthed yokels whereas, here, it's a bunch of silent, introvert and inexperienced geeks and in either of the two cases you wouldn't want your fade to depend on such a motley crew. It goes without saying that the visual effects are stupendous and often even downright breathtaking. The wondrous visual exhibition begins with the opening sequence already and carries forth throughout the whole movie. The effects are so dazzling you sometimes almost literally experiences the sun burning holes through your own skin. My advise would be to enjoy the rudimentary outline of the plot and the brilliant use of special effects as much as possible, especially during the first hour of the film, because afterwards the script takes a couple of unforgivably lame twists and the whole tone becomes indigestible and preposterous.</fullReview>

When the sun lights up, you can see how it spreads around earth like some kind of city whose lights got back on? And what's with the fission effects, like fireflies running around for a few seconds? It's an oversize nuclear bomb, not a hologram generator.Ugh... Horrible. I ended the movie with my eyes half open and a "WHAT?!?!" expression on my face. Couldn't stand not rate this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Hope of Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the future, the sun is dying and Earth lives another glacial period. After the failure of the Icarus Mission, a team of eight astronauts are sent to the sun in the Icarus II Mission to explode a weapon generating a supernova within the sun in the last hope of planet Earth. However, when a crew-member commits a mistake in the operation of the aircraft shield, he jeopardizes the survival of the group."Sunshine" is an original sci-fi using the storyline of environmental disaster based on the death of the sun. However, the story is too short for 107 minutes running time, therefore it is developed in an extreme slow-pace. The character Pinbacker is not well developed and the plot becomes a complete mess when this lunatic appears in the story, without any explanation how he could have survived for seven years. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Sunshine, Alerta Solar" ("Sunshine, Solar Alert")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretty package - shame about the aftertaste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film at the Natfilmfestival (Nightfilm festival) here in Copenhagen Wednesday night, and I was very nervous. nervous because this film could go both ways: it could be a stunning vision with emotions and a thought provoking storyline... or it could be Armageddon...and about half way in, it hit me: this film blows. everything has been seen before. the only thing missing is a song by Aerosmith... which was all I had in my head half an hour after watching this film. the only reason i don't give 1 out of 10 is because of the sets which were stunning.I expected much more from Danny Boyle and that Cillian fella... bummer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Film of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just can't get my head around the fact that a film this bad exists. I genuinely can't think of anything good to say about it. The plot is as weak as anything I've ever seen.The acting is terrible.The characters are totally un developed.The cinematography is excessively arty, and very frustrating. The script is all over the place. I hated this film so much, I cant even begin to explain to you. I went to a friends house, he put on this, and afterwards I was so enraged, I just stood up and left. I couldn't even talk to him.DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Source Of All Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story line of Sunshine involves a second ship being sent toward the sun to get it going again. The Sun which science assures us is dying and the earth entering a permanent winter status which means a lingering death for the planet as well.That star we call our sun is the source of life on the planet. The ancients knew that even if the scientific knowledge was rather limited back in the day. It's why it was worshiped back then.While up there the crew of the second ship discovers the first ship and concludes sabotage. Now who would do such a thing, someone clearly not in his right mind and someone who probably would have failed the psychological tests to be an astronaut in the first place. It is on this sad bit of realism that Sunshine's story fails.Not even the rather spurious science that it is based on. I doubt that fifty years in the future we would have the remotest idea of how to deal with such a problem. When the sun does go bad, presumably we'll be traveling all over the universe by then and just pick up and leave the Earth.A really good cast consisting of folks like Cillian Murphy, Chris Evans, Rose Byrne, and Michelle Yeoh is really wasted on a lot of scientific claptrap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boyle Aims For The Stars But Falls Short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering I missed it on its initial release and didn't bother with the DVD either I was looking forward to seeing SUNSHINE . Danny Boyle is an extremely talented director who can cross genres as diverse as horror , children's films and love stories . So I was very interested in seeing how he'd handle hard sci-fi . The answer is very badly Much of the failings can be laid firmly at the door of screenwriter Alex Garland since the whole film revolves around " The Idiot Plot " ie if any character does anything sensible the film would end there and then and Garland plays the idiot to the max . After a slow beginning the more the characters are explored the more idiocy intrudes . Capa for example is the only person inboard the Icarus 2 who knows how to set up the bomb to reignite the Sun . So all the crew members have an idiosyncratic unique skill that means if anything happens to them the mission is in danger of failing ? Don't you think all the crew members would be trained in all aspects of their mission just in case something happens to someone ? The more the plot goes on the more idiotic it becomes . The crew find the spaceship from the previous mission conveniently parked just outside Mercury and think it might be a good idea to pick up another fusion bomb " just in case we need it " If there's anything worse than idiotic astronauts then it's pessimistic idiotic astronauts . They do have to dock with Icarus 1 since they've lost most of their oxygen due to some idiot messing up co-ordinates . You really do start losing sympathy for the fate of mankind when the human race only seems to recruit idiots for very important space missions . It also sets up a scene where the captain of the mission states " You're getting the only available spacesuit Capa because you're the only member who knows how to set the fusion bomb " This scene might be helpful for any audience member who's in a coma but not if you've watched the preceding hour's runtime where it's be battered around our heads . Right if anything happens to Capa that's the mission failed ? Right we get it so no need to repeat it every ten minutes The docking of the two spacecraft also sets up the plot contrivance of Pinbacker going on an idiot cull . It's a ridiculous plot turn that changes the whole tone of the movie but when you've got an idiot plot then a mad , mental serial killer will feel at home in it .Unfortnately director Danny Boyle ruins the final third as much as screenwriter Alex Garland . With an insane and mutilated Pinbacker the focus of the story Boyle throws a massive spanner in the works by making the villain visually enigmatic - the audience never get to fully see Pinbacker . Worse still when Pinbacker goes on his killing spree there seems to be whole sequences left out . The action jumps around so much you're left feeling all the characters have got teleporting abilities I perhaps can understand Boyle want to do something different for his chase sequences . Chase sequences are something Boyle does superlatively . We all remember these sequences from TRAINSPOTTING , 28 DAYS LATER and SLUMDOG MILLONAIRE . Indeed he also worked as second unit director on " Don's escape from the house " in 28 WEEKS LATER , one of the most exciting heart pounding sequences in modern cinema . But why do something different if it doesn't work ? Make no mistake the visuals of the final act are a spectacular failure and one can't help wondering why Boyle was unable to rise above Garland's material</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sunshine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are quite a few great directors that have a go at the sci-fi genre, e.g. Tim Burton, Brian De Palma, and most unfortunately aren't fantastic, and this is the same for this film from director Danny Boyle (Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, 28 Days Later). Basically, it is 2057, and our (Earth's) Sun is dying very slowly (this unfortunately will really happen, we just don't know when). Anyway, a team were sent years ago to restart/reignite the star, in the space station called Icarus 2 (replacing the failed mission), with a talking computer system (voiced by Chipo Chung) obeying orders (like 2001: A Space Odyssey's HAL 9000, except it doesn't turn evil) of the same name. The team includes Robert Capa (28 Days Later's Cillian Murphy), Corazon (Tomorrow Never Dies' Michelle Yeoh), Mace (Fantastic Four's Chris Evans), Capt. Kaneda (Ring's Hiroyuki Sanada), Cassie (28 Weeks Later's Rose Byrne), Dr. Searle (Training Day's Cliff Curtis), Trey (Benedict Wong), Harvey (Troy Garity) and Capt. Pinbacker (Mark Strong). There may be a main plot, but there's no real story, all that happens in the film is that they can see the sun without being blinded, the ship breaks down, they find the other Icarus space station, everyone dies, and the mission is successful, oh, and for some reason there is a ridiculous blurry guy from the mission log video trying to kill them. The special effects are obviously very good, and the recognisable people in it have their moments, but this isn't really a film to watch a lot. Worth watching!</fullReview>
