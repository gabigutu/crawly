		<shortDescription>A simple comedy that does its job.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading many reviews, i have to agree that this is a technically a bad film. The humor in this movie is very raw and crude (which doesn't bother me), and it has a very simple storyline. I was ready to give this movie a rating of a 5 or below until i stopped looking into the movie too much, and saw it for what it is. The purpose of a comedy is to make people laugh, and that is exactly what myself and the rest of the theater did for the majority of the movie. The movie is so relevant as well with the upcoming presidential elections, and i feel this movie helps take the edge of the brutality of the current Obama vs. Romney.If you just want to see a simple movie that will make you laugh without having to think about the plot, then see the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ribald, funny, merciless fun at the expense of politicians and politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very, very funny movie that's very, very coarse. If you are not amused by jokes about sex, body parts and bodily functions, effeminate men, scantily-clad women, politics, and politicians then this isn't your movie. If you like that sort of thing, then you need to see this movie now. Light, fluffy entertainment. No thinking required (or desired). Good guys win. Bad guys either lose or are redeemed. I run hot and cold on Will Farrel movies. This one's a keeper for him but the real star of this movie is Zach Galifianakis who seems to replicate Jack Black's character in "Bernie" but with a completely different take. This movie will make you feel better about what's coming to American politics in the next three months.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its ironically authentic lampooning of real politics is the funniest part of all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Campaign offers many hilarious moments in the vein of humor that one has come to expect from its creators. Will Ferrell is entertaining as always with his "presidential" accent and foul-mouthed quips. Zach Galifianakis also presents quite a character, often outshining his co-star with his supremely bizarre eccentricities. But underneath the layer of laughs is a rather forgettable story. It's undoubtedly a great basis for the two comedy giants to clash, but the plot neither furthers our interest in its leads nor their plight. Much of the time it feels as if we lose no matter who wins. Perhaps its ironically authentic lampooning of real politics is the funniest part of all.North Carolina congressman Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) has fallen into a leisurely routine of false promises and general negligence in his duties as the longtime unopposed representative. But after an obscene phone call to the wrong person finds Brady's approval rating drastically down, corporate bigwigs Glenn (John Lithgow) and Wade Motch (Dan Aykroyd), decide to replace him with someone they can easily control for their own devious schemes. Their candidate is mild-mannered Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis), a tourism enthusiast with na?ve ideas of bettering his hometown. When Huggins announces his candidacy, and the stunned Brady quickly introduces him to the sinister world of politics, the battlefield is set for copious smear campaigns, name tarnishing and disgraceful machinations to destroy each other's reputations. But as the debates get dirtier and the backstabbing more barbaric, both candidates begin to question how far they'll go to win ? and what they're willing to lose.The Campaign has an amusing premise. It examines the corruption, general crookedness, and underhanded big business influences behind politics, employing a wildly satirical viewpoint coupled with abrasive language and hysterical visual gags. "When you've got the money, nothing's unpredictable," insists Glenn Motch, defining his wealthy persuasions over chancy voters. An underdog candidate is uprooted from unremarkableness to be subjected to an immoderate transformation, itself an entertaining feat, for the sake of molding a puppet for exploitive moneymen. And he is to combat a long unopposed, professional politician, who has grown too accustomed to the post without having to put effort toward purpose or even basic responsibility. The two face off in riotous slander, invidious advertising strategies, backbiting, and baby punching. And their warfare gets steadily more caustic as election day looms. But that's it ? the setup is the story, and there's nothing more meaningful beyond that.The tired theme of "do the right thing" rears its head, but it never serves to stress originality or the means for further mockeries of recognizable, past political blunders. The My Fair Lady shtick is catchy, Galifianakis and Ferrell are equally witty in their roles (their ridiculousness is amplified by an anticipated collaboration), while goofy voices (think one part Jiminy Glick and one part Stuart Smalley for Zach, with Will blending his Saturday Night Live presidential impressions), dirty jokes, and slapstick weigh in proportionally for humor. The Campaign also points the finger at the idiotic everyman who misinterprets intent and blindly falls for thinly stretched defamation attempts. But what does it all lead to? A few grand laughs and lovable imbeciles don't amount to a story ? it's essentially a promising foundation for comedy that forgets to tell a full-bodied, meaningful tale of political conversion and redemption.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good satire of politics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Campaign is a good satire of politics. The Campaign shows why the public has lost faith in the USA political process. The satire of the movie shows how candidates do not answer questions, but skirt issues and use generic themes like freedom etc. The Campaign shows there is no discussion of the issues and the two candidates deteriorate the campaign into the Springer show. One has sex with the other's wife as a campaign ad. The Campaign shows that the special interests run both parties, which is the reason why there is no real debate, and interest in what is good for the community. The film is funny but has some low ball comedy on Religion, sex, and people. I give The Campaign a seven out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining, but not totally satisfactory, political satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The election period in the United States has traditionally been a fountain of humorous material exploited to the maximum by the comedians, most of them on TV, but also in cinema, as we can see this year in the film The Campaign, directed by Jay Roach, whose filmography includes some excellent comedies (the Austin Powers trilogy)...and other deeply irritating ones (Meet the Fockers, Dinner for Schmucks). I would also like to point out that The Campaign isn't Roach's first incursion into the political field, because he also made the TV movies Recount and Game Change, which both made a brilliant work in portraying the pressures and vices from a presidential campaign from a serious and (more or less) impartial point of view. Could The Campaign achieve the same but in a humorous context? I don't think so, but I can't deny I found the film entertaining nevertheless.I think there's an excellent political satire hidden in some place of The Campaign. The general premise of an inept lout who is transformed into a charismatic candidate manipulated by the economical elite is very interesting; and even though it's not completely original, I think it's appropriate to occasionally remember it in order to recognize it whenever we find it in the real world (something which undoubtedly happens with a sad frequency). However, the few intelligence from the screenplay is diluted by the coarse and vulgar humor employed as vehicle of the message. I have to admit I laughed in various occasions (specially during the "Our Father" scene), and I definitely found some ingenuity in the creation of absurd but credible situations (at least in the filthy context of contemporary politics)...however, for every scene that works, there's five or six which only provoke whining, specially due to the tendency the actors show to "play the fool". I think this is a very subjective point in any comedy; but in my personal taste, the humor always works better when the actors take their roles seriously and let the comedy to naturally flow from their attitudes and reactions. When they try to force the laughs with a physical or verbal affectation, they lose spontaneity and, specially, destruct the reality of the characters in order to transform them into caricatures.And besides of that, I found the screenplay of The Campaign too innocent and predictable, taking a safe route until leading to a happy ending. So, I guess that not all the political satires can be as subtle and effective as Wag the Dog or In the Loop; however, I can give a moderate recommendation to The Campaign as an entertaining comedy, despite not being very memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Campaign: A decent review to a decent movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I love Will Ferrell and Zack Galifianakis. I love most of the films they starred in. So upon hearing that these two comedic heavyweights will be starring in the same movie together, you could imagine my excitement. Did it meet my expectations? Sort of. This comedy staring these two actors was enjoyable and had plenty of laughs but after viewing, I realized how it could have been much better. Basically, Democratic playboy Cam Brady has to verse off against republican every-man Marty Huggins after Marty enters the race against the long-term congressmen Cam at the last minute. This of course leads to hilarious incidents that occur in both parties. The basic plot line is really effective since the film is not biased and allows for making fun of both parties, which I very much appreciate. Unfortunately, the real issues lie in the acting and writing. Ferrell And Galifianakis really don't get the chance to spread there "wings" in this film. Both have the potential to be hilarious but they never get the chance. Jason Sudeiki's seems very unused as Cam Brady's Assistant Mitch. Again, he does not get the chance to shine in this film. I love John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd but there roles in this film are very unnecessary. They are not really funny or entertaining to watch. This is unfortunate. Jay Roach really tried to make a good film, but I think he picked the wrong actors for this film. He shines in romantic comedies like Meet the Parents but he is trying to hard to make a Will Farrell film. It would have been much better with Adam McKay. It's not all bad though. The scenes that are funny, are hilarious and make will make anyone with a sense of humor laugh. The film's pacing is very good and the chemistry between Farrell And Galifianakis is just perfect. In the end, if you go in the theater with an open mind and a sense of humor, you will enjoy it. Just don't expect another Step Brothers or Hangover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Campaign...2.5 out of 4 Skittles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>t seems like it should be easy to make a funny movie about the state of our political climate?.rich, greedy, corrupt people spending millions of dollars to make television ads that spread blatant lies to the uninformed voting public, but The Campaign ends up feeling a bit underwhelming of what could have been.Screenwriters Chris Henchy &amp; Shawn Harwell only scratched the surface of the real life hilarity of the current political landscape. All they had to do was turn on any TV news channel and take note of the circus that current politics have become?from former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to Weiner-Gate to?well?Sarah Palin, but for Chris Henchy, the writer of past stinkers Land of the Lost and The Other Guys, I guess that is what should be expected.Will Ferrell (Step Brothers, Anchorman) and Zach Galifianakis (The Hangover, Due Date) make a fine comedic duo, but their one-note characters leave these candidates without much to say. Ferrell ends up doing a less funny version of his George W. Bush impersonation. His iconic character was a slam-dunk on short SNL skits, but runs thin in a feature film.The Campaign definitely provides its share of laughs that keep this film above average, but doesn't live up to other classic films produced by Ferrell and Adam McKay's Gary Sanchez production company?I.E. Step Brothers, Anchorman, Talladega Nights. The Campaign may end up being one of the most profitable comedies of the 2012 blockbuster season, but compared against the other duds Hollywood barfed out this summer (The Watch, That's My Boy, The Dictator) that isn't saying too much.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a race between two congressman candidates in North Carolina."The Campaign" is a fun and light hearted mockery of modern American politics, but it is also surprisingly real in terms of what could possibly happen in a real election campaign. The plot is funny and really gets me laughing, but I am the most impressed by the emotional ending that conveys a victory to morality. Another thing that really stands out is the Asian maid who speaks with an amazing African and also Spanish accent.I enjoyed watching this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Campaign (2012) - He Just Punched a Baby!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two comedic favorites Will Ferrell and Zach Galifanakis finally share the screen together in "The Campaign". Although being casted in their usual and cliché roles; Ferrell as a competitive mindless idiot that's considered the best at everything, and Galifanakis as a weird, but likable sweater vest-wearing dork; these two still share a decent chemistry in a movie that's although not a perfect comedy as you'd expect it to be, it's still a pretty decent comedy, that consistently hits the funny bone, sometimes in the right places. Ferrell plays Cam Brady, a presidential candidate that has never lost a single campaign in his life, and is now running for the fifth term. But then, out of the blue, to actually give Brady some competition, Galifanakis' Marty Huggins is volunteered to run for Congress. It then leads into one of the deadliest campaigns ever seen on the face of the earth. Although "The Campaign" doesn't reach the level of complete comedic gold, director Jay Roach was able to bring in some consistent funny moments that are more worthy of a giggle, rather than "bursting to tears" kind of laughs. I was really expecting more from Will Ferrell, who seems to be tiring in his cliché role, and I felt that it was really hard to feel sympathy for this character, because he's the only un-likable person throughout. I guess I had more sympathy for Galifanakis' character, because not only was he funny, but he was also the only person that I actually cared about. But aside from the two male leads, Jason Sudeikis, Dylan McDermott, John Lithgow, Dan Aykroyd, and Brian Cox round up the supporting cast, most of them delivering some decent enough performances. I say most of them, because Dylan McDermott's contribution as Marty's campaign manager seemed wasted in the role, and didn't really steal the scenes as everyone said he would. I honestly think that this guy wasn't really that funny. Although half of the jokes sadly fall flat, the other half is filled with one hilarious scene after the next. From the scene with Marty Huggin's family at the dinner table, to Cam accidentally punching a baby at a campaign party. This proves that there are scenes that help save this movie from being a bad one. Although at it's noticeable flaws, "The Campaign" is still a decent and pretty funny movie that has a clear perspective on what it was trying to be. "The Campaign", in my review, "laughable and enjoying, but hardly anything special".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Campaign is one of the best comedies that I have ever seen. You definitely have to watch this movie in context, and see past the obvious, crass, junior-high-school humor. Most of the real humor is buried deep within this film. A few subtle points, just to get you started:1) Labrador Retrievers (dogs) did NOT originate in the USA. Pugs are from China, but were bred long before China was under Communist rule.2) The car that Cam Brady drives is made in Canada.3) Cam Brady parts his hair to the Left... Marty Huggins parts his hair to the Right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Trick Pony Ferrel- no rosette!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I confess I am not a huge Will Ferrel fan although I find him watch-able in films which don't completely revolve around him. This was not one of them. I thought I'd give it a go as I love political satire but this was just a really poor display of watered down, repetitive slapstick full of stereotypical characters and scenarios.To its credit the plot accurately conveyed the joke that is American politics, particularly how it is big business and back handers that are really pulling the strings and making all the big decisions and the typical overplaying of 'family values' and every politicians close personal friend Jesus H Christ, in their campaigns. The sheep voters of course were all too happy to lap it all up and sway their opinion based on the lame speeches and false promises of the candidates. It was all supposed to be tongue in cheek and satirical but in reality it was just depressing and patronising. I don't need my comedy to be intelligent by any means but the whole thing was just appalling. Honestly I laughed a total of 3 times. Once was at a baby being punched in the face.It really is just Will Ferrel playing his usual 'I'm an egotistical, air head, a-hole' character, with a slightly different hairstyle. I preferred the guy who played his opponent (Zach Galifianakis), both character wise and performance wise.One thing that really bugged me about this film was the way that the women were represented. Yes politics is a male dominated environment but apart from a few mute women extras there was only one female who really had more than a few lines and being Asian they were all pretty much jokes about racial stereotyping and she was a maid. The rest of the females were there as sex objects basically. The usual blonde bimbo 'Lewinsky' character, another who was walking around with her nipple accidentally showing, the hot little, supportive wife who actually turns out to be a power hungry, gold digging, cold hearted cow. At one point Will's character seduces the oppositions wife just to smear his character and campaign and of course she is warm hearted and naive so had to be chubby and therefore grateful for his sleaze. Oh and they had one black male speaking part and it was only a couple of lines and he was technically mixed race, in a film set in North Carolina? Yeah okay so a dumb comedy doesn't have a duty or responsibility to represent society accurately but it makes it very clear who this movie is aimed at.This is jock humour, strictly for Ferrel devotees and I had hoped for more. He really is a one trick pony! Watch the trailer and then move on with your life. Because those are the only good scenes in the whole movie, condensed into a few seconds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film had a chance to be a thoughtful satire on the societal impact of money on politics and issues such as the outsourcing of American jobs, not to mention the growing separation between the political class and the public. It settled for a host of clichés. Instead, it contented itself in pandering to elite prejudices. Christians and Southerners are ignorant, and they are hypocrites. Their children, are even more ignorant and more perverse. MSNBC and CNN make cameo appearances lending their support to these notions. The language is unnecessarily crude,lewd and indecent. I am no prude, but this film often seemed just a lot of tasteless potty talk masquerading as humor.Too bad. There are one or two clever skits. Net Net: Don't waste your money. I was once a Democrat.

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Campaign</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the US Presidential Elections gaining traction and going into its final leg before the polls in November, it's probably natural that a comedy about American politics gets released into the cinemas to capitalize on election fever, as well as to lampoon the various strategies, and poke fun on the candidates who would be more than inclined to say the darnedest things that don't make too much sense, or to behave in a hypocritical manner, all of which are fodder to be made fun of.Directed by Jay Roach, who is no stranger to those who enjoy the trilogy of Austin Powers films, The Campaign put two current funny men together, and watch them explode as they rib each other to shreds as part of the political hustings to garner more votes by discrediting the other. It's never more than just to share one's plans for the electorate when elected, or to reveal and convince them of one's programs, but to take the more interesting approach to character assassinate, and utilize the power of the media, and one's carefully built persona as perception for the voting public.Comedy aside, this film lays down very real issues and problems with politics anywhere around the world, and that is more worrying, whether the right people are shunning serving the community, and the wrong people with the wrong motives seeking office instead, so as to further the reserves in their coffers, or that of their supporters with the tacit understanding that the interests of those who had backed one's campaign should be looked on favourably, with any meeting conducted to discuss these terms deemed never having been convened. Corporations are also seen as shady organizations when they contribute to campaign funds, and in truth with money talking these days, can make or hurt politicians chances by playing up or down their capabilities or screw ups. It's been some time seeing Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow on screen, and here they play unscrupulous businessmen who are looking at in- sourcing and exploitation of cheap labour, selling out their state/country once they have their preferred candidate occupy office.As you would have learnt from the trailer, The Campaign pits Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis as two politicians getting at each others throats from the get go. For the former, as Democratic incumbent Cam Brady, unopposed for the most parts of his career given walkovers, his seeking office probably had to do with the satiation of his sexual desires, with a major boo boo involving a dirty message left on someone else's answering machine doing him in. As for Galifianakos' Marty Huggins, he got plucked out of obscurity just because he happens to be the son of a well known, but retired politician, and got thrust into the limelight having sold the idea of doing his father proud, and to lend a hand doing something worthwhile for society.So it's a fight that's filled with plenty of dirty tricks, mostly centered around character assassination from both camps in tit for tat fashion, providing ammunition for its comedic scenes. The gloves are off in a no holds barred, winner takes all competition that has absolutely no rules, with either side eager to jump on discrediting the opposition camp. And the campaign managers, played by Jason Sudeikis and Dylan McDermott who belong to the Cam Brady and Marty Huggins camps respectively, are hugely responsible for that. The last film seen with campaign managers playing a big part is in George Clooney's Ides of March, with almost the same level of seriousness and intensity seen in The Campaign, especially Dylan McDermott's Tim Wattley who has to build Marty's popularity from scratch, and create a credible candidate out of a dim wit.For those who appreciate the other Jay Roach comedies, expect the usual toilet humour, and plenty of f-bombs creeping their way into the film. Will Ferrell is also at his element here as the politician who cannot stand losing, blessed with a trophy family, and his pairing with Galifianakis proved to be successful, especially during scenes which they share and have to go one up against the other. Galifianakis continues in his usual roles as none too bright characters having a ball of a time, and here his story arc provided for a little bit of a melodrama, which I thought was a nice touch and a break from the comedy, serving as reminder that family matters, and should take priority rather than being shelved aside for ambition. Or worse, to pretend to lead a lifestyle just because it has the consensus of the majority.The Campaign runs at a very light 85 minutes, although it did feel a little longer than that, especially in the final few scenes that dwelled into back stories built up to provide a little bit more character motivation and common history. Still, it's entertaining, funny for the most parts, and relevant, and if we don't have much power to change the rot at the polls, the least we can do is to laugh at it. Which is certainly more fun by the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Script not worthy of the two stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The comedy in this movie, such as it is, is weak and a little flat, which is something I didn't think I'd ever say about a film starring Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis. I chuckled a couple of times, but otherwise I felt no urge to laugh. There is a distinct bitter streak to the humor, with little heart to redeem it until one specific moment of unbelievable mood whiplash. The actors did fine, but they've had much better material in other vehicles (Ferrell in Anchorman and Galifianakis in The Hangover being just two notable examples).It's a shame because I'd heard some good things about The Campaign, and with those two comedy stars it should have been something greater than the sum of its parts. Even something equal would have been good. This just didn't seem like the right movie to bring the two together.The supporting cast was fine, though nobody really stood out from the pack. It was fun seeing Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow as the corrupt millionaire brothers, even if their plot seems to have been taken wholesale from Trading Places. Jason Sudeikis wisely plays his role with subtlety, in contrast to Ferrell and Galifianakis.I guess The Campaign isn't the worst way to spend 85 minutes. But by the same token, I'm glad I didn't put down the money to see it in the theatre.And the less said about the punching of the baby, the better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Either a movie has merit and redeeming value or it sucks (as Will Farrel would say). There were a few humorous skits within the film but what was self-evident was the vulgar and repeated bad jokes and skits that had no logical flow with the subject of this movie. Sometimes an idea can be over done to an extreme.This is the trouble with this movie. I'm not a prude but there is such a thing as "Beating a Dead Horse". That is the serious problem with this story.

		<fullReview>This film just continues to convince me that the "dumbing" of the American film industry is alive...unfortunately! This piece of garbage was not worth the gum I chewed that I picked off the bottom of my seat! Will Ferrell is absolutely talentless. The screenwriters -- Shawn Harwell and Chris Henchy -- showed a total lack of creativity. The comedy (for the moment, please allow me to call it such) in this film was predictable, raunchy, and aimed at the lowest common denominator. Cursing, naming body parts, and achieving other such low-level attempts at getting viewers to crack a smile just isn't funny. How many times can you go for the same jokes... when they weren't funny the first time? Lastly, it amazes me that -- unless they needed money to pay their mortgages in this dreadful economy -- John Lithgow, Dylan McDermott, Wolf Blitzer, Piers Morgan, Bill Maher, Chris Matthews, Dennis Miller, Lawrence O'Donnell, Joe Scarborough, Mika Brzezinski, Willie Geist, and Ed Schultz -- would lend their names to this "candidate" for the worst film of all-time!I will say, however, that "THE" best part in this film was played by Karen Maruyama ("Mrs. Yao"). She was fantastically hysterical!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure where to start. I'll go back to the beginning. One fine Thursday night I was settling down to watch Ted on the big screen, when on came a trailer for The Campaign. I chuckled a few times and was confident that further hilarity would ensue in the actual feature. All signs were promising. All signs were wrong, dead wrong. This crude political satire is neither witty nor biting, but most awful of all, it's downright unfunny. In what gets earmarked as 2012's biggest disappointment (so far), the potentially side-splitting combination of Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis is yawn-inducing at best, cringe-worthy at worst; neither comedian walking away with a solitary laugh. Of all people it's Dylan McDermott that gets a couple of amusing moments, his shady and ruthless campaign manager a welcome respite from the embarrassing blandness of the leads and other co-stars John Lithgow, Dan Aykroyd and Brian Cox. The campaign slogan for Galifianakis' bumbling Marty Huggins sums this film up most accurately: "It's a mess".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a ridiculous and unfunny comedy trying to disguise itself as a satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a line, and not even a fine one, between satire and goofy comedies. Even in satirical films that have raunchy, campy, and over-exaggerated humor, the comedy is used to enhance the satire and make a stronger statement about the subject of the film. And at times it seems that The Campaign is trying its hardest to be a proper satire. But in the end, it is a conflicted and confused film with split personality disorder between political humor and a Will Ferrell comedy.Co-Starring Ferrell (the comedian of yester-year) and Zach Galifianakis (who seemed to be the comedian of the now), The Campaign tells the ridiculous story of the congressional race in the 14th district of North Carolina between two very different politicians. Ferrell plays Cam Brady, a Congressman that has run unopposed for several years and plans on winning another easy election. But he is stunned when Marty Huggins (Galifianakis) comes out of nowhere to announce his candidacy for Congress. Huggins, the son of a rich political father, is brought on to defeat Brady by two political leaders known as the Motch Brothers (Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow) who believe Huggins is the goat they can use to bring cheap Chinese labor to the US.Quickly, the campaigns turn from an honest race between two men to an all out war between two politicians that will do anything they can to win. And in a film that begins with a Ross Perot quote that says "War has rules, mud wrestling has rules?politics has no rules," you can imagine the amount of ridiculous comedy two politicians played by Ferrell and Galifianakis get into.And while I am sure there is a crowd that will find this film humorous, I rarely did. In an hour and forty minute comedy starring two big names like Ferrell and Galifianakis, I laughed maybe three times, two of which due to how bad the film was. Like I said at the beginning, there is a difference between satire and goofy?this is off the wall ridiculous.Cam Brady may be Ferrell's worst character ever. He is everything we have seen from Ferrell before regurgitated and stuffed into a $3,000 suit. He3 is dumb, crass, and completely unoriginal and uninspired. Sure, there is humor and making a statement about how dumb our politicians are and the extremes campaigns can go to, but having Cam Brady punch a baby in the face, then a dog in the face, and then use a sex tape as a political ad is not clever or funny?it is flat out stupid. For anyone to watch it and have any moment of "Yeah, politicians really are dumb," is ridiculous, but seemingly something the writers and filmmakers were aiming at. There seems to be a necessity to make political statements about how dumb politicians are, how corrupt our government is, and the lengths everyone in politics will go to win a race, but it is within a stupid comedy that doesn't ever take itself seriously in its satire.To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/the-campaign/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay so it could have been smarter but it's still pretty funny. Sure there are some obvious gags and the Bible Belt makes a easy target, but for those of us who aren't committed Republicans or Democrats it provides even-handed laughs. Ferrell plays a Ron Burgundy wannabee while Zack is ostensibly a family man though he camps it up massively, inviting speculation that he bats for the other side. Anyway it's a hoot, if a little crude at times. I've just had my review rejected because it was too concise and they want me to rabbit on for 10 lines, sorry about that, lah di dah blah blah what do you think about the mid- terms?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The One Time I Root For A Republican</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found myself rooting for Marty watching this movie because of all the things Cam does to try and save face, although many of them go horrendously wrong, such as the cop car stealing. Many of the things Cam does are just downright outrageous, especially when he makes the porno with Marty's wife! This movie was the first time I saw Jason Sudekis outside of Saturday Night Live, and he did a fantastic job as Cam's campaign manager, walking out when the time was right and all. Speaking of SNL, several alums appear in this film such as Will Ferrel and Dan Akroyd, so it's a nice little reunion.As for the movie as a whole, it was hilarious! If you can find it, rent it! You will not be disappointed with this comedic film based on a congressional race.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply Funny Political Satire!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I'm not the one for politics and in fact, I despise politics on a whole. However, I found "The Campaign" to be a wildly funny affair. There is plenty of over-the-top humor here to satisfy comedy fans and of course the big laughs here involves a certain conversation around a dinner table as well as a baby. As a political movie, the film plays it pretty safe as both the Left and the Right are only moderately poked at.Jay Roach, known for his brilliant work with Austin Powers and Meet the Fockers, returns to direct this film. Cam Brady has been a North Carolina congressman for several terms now and is on the verge of securing another term. But, he ends up running against a Marty Huggins, who happens to be the candidate no one expects to be running for office.Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis are both very funny here and they seem to feed off each other's energy. This is Ferrell's funniest film since Step Brothers and he just has scene after scene with end up as laugh riots. Galifinakis is really good too despite being somewhat type-casted. But the golden moments are when these two are on screen, going at it with each other.Overall, this is a really funny film and funnier than I anticipated. I tend to avoid political films, but since this film has no agenda rather than to poke fun at politics, I was all for this. My fear was that the trailer gave many points away, but be prepared for some unexpected jokes. This is a very funny movie. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Comedy with Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen many Will Ferrell comedies, I went into The Campaign with an open mind but did not have high or low expectations. I guess it was only a matter of time that Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis starred in a film together and this was necessary. The Campaign provides quite some laughs depending on your humor, some shock value and overall a good message. Although the film somewhat turns for the worst in it's finale, but this was expected.While a little less likable, Ferrell mostly sticks to schtick he perfected in Anchorman and has done variations of many times since. Galifianakis, though, brings a new persona to the screen. Just as the movie suggests there is more to Huggins than the man we first see, the role indicates there is more to Galifianakis the movie star than Alan from The Hangover. By judging the trailer, you will get a good glimpse as what to expect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Competent comedy making a decent double act out of two of the genre's top guys at the moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningHigh flying Democrat hopeful Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) is caught out in a series of embarrassing misdemeanours. Seizing on this string of incidents, two wealthy business owner brothers bolster support for a Republican candidate in the shape of Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis) a ridiculously puritanical man who needs to develop an edge in order to present a challenge to his opponent. But as he does, each becomes ever more hellbent to sabotage the other as events press on.Politics, like everything else in America, is ridiculously over-blown, and so this salacious satire of electoral confrontation is a gleefully inspired creation, if nothing else. From the director of Meet the Parents/Fockers, and starring two of comedy's soaring high fliers at the moment, it's a reliably competent effort that probably doesn't squeeze as much juice out of it's comic potential as it could have, but is still a sufficiently laugh laden outing with no room for political correctness (no pun intended) or subtlety.There's an interesting role reversal going on in both the nature of the characters and the tone of those playing them. While a Democratic hopeful in the movies is usually the righteous, idealistic person while the Republican is typically the more shady and under-hand, the script here turns this set up on it's head, with Ferrell as the sleazy but dynamic and arrogant 'left leaner', while Galifianakis is a timid, squeaky voiced Repubbo who has to be driven to be as determined to succeed as his rival, until eventually becoming as bad as him. It helps with the assortment of supporting actors on display, including Jason Sudeikis, Dylan McDermott, John Lithgow, Dan Ackroyd and Brian Cox. The Campaign is a valiant, worthy effort that doesn't become the classic it could have been, but is no less reliable for a few good laughs. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to evaluate a film like this because its -- well, its variance is so great. Did I laugh out loud at some of the gags? Yes. Did I wince at others? You bet.What's more, this isn't really a movie about mud slinging during a campaign but it's more than that, almost a satire of American political values, or American values in general. When you ridicule the electoral process of the nation, you ridicule everyone who participates in it. And when you ridicule everyone, you ridicule the society that they've formed.Will Ferrell, who made me chuckle here for the first time, is a four-time Representative from a congressional district in North Carolina, comfortable in his numb, dumb skin. He speaks in platitudes and does all the other things that congressman are presumed to do. He's funded by, and compliant to the wishes of, John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd, the "Motch brothers." The Motch brothers are quite a pair. They'll stop at nothing to advance their interests. They've already implemented the first part of their plan. They've bought up a tremendous amount of acreage in a rural area and then sold it to the Chinese at an enormous profit. Next, they will cooperate with the Chinese in building a large red factory, once Ferrell gets those nettlesome EPA regulations out of the way, and bring in Chinese workers at fifty cents an hour. They will call it "insourcing." That's a pretty clever fantasy, and there are more gags like it. Ferrell's opponent is Zach Galifianakis, a naive Southrin schlub who manages to collect all the documents needed to run against Ferrell, who is a shoe-in.What follows may not be what you'd expect. The contest between the idealistic schlub and the arrogant professional politician doesn't gradually devolve into mud slinging. As in real life, it BEGINS with dirt. Ferrell's campaign runs an attack ad showing a photo-shopped picture of Saddam Hussein with mustache, black beret, shades, and uniform. As the voice-over lambastes Galifianakis, the items are whipped away from the image, one by one, until Galifianakis' face appears. They have the mustache in common, as the voice-over points out.When his candidacy is about to be taken seriously, Galifianakis queries his wife and two children over the dinner table. They are going to receive intense scrutiny from the media and he wants to know if there are any secrets they've been hiding, any skeletons in their closets that might damage his campaign. Their initial innocent confessions grow into the most abhorrent abominations.But then there is a certain amount of silliness, not so much in the dialog but in the slapstick scenes, such as the one in which a desperate Ferrell is courting the vote of a snake-handling cult and is bitten by a rattlesnake. The psychedelic effects aren't amusing, but a later glimpse of his forearm, purple and swollen to the size of Popeye's, is.The happy ending seems grafted on to a much more effective story. The writers and director should have gone the "Dr. Strangelove" route and lived with the consequences of what they've already demonstrated. It also seems rushed at time, but it's still pretty amusing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... and brought towards a predictable solution... But the start-up was nice and funny: bunch of good / very good comedy actors, lots of political satire and politically incorrect jokes and topics, fast events with funny lines, but gradually the "tire started to deflate" and many slow and unnecessary scenes and moments appeared. Luckily, the total length is around 1,5 hours, so nothing become really annoying... The two protagonists Will Ferrell as Camden "Cam" Brady and Zach Galifianakis as Martin "Marty" Huggins are, of course, wonderful, but they are pleasant supported by so-called older generation of comedy actors such as John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd; female characters, however, are sketchy and I can't say I will remember the actresses when appearing in other movies.Nevertheless, it is a good political comedy as events-thoughts depicted take place in many countries - verbosity, greed and semblance seem to the be universal phenomena within politics. Soon, in my country, local elections will take place, and it would be witty to show The Campaign to them planning to go to the polling stations...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watered-down look at Politics....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Investigative journalist Greg Palast (VULTURE'S PICNIC), in a lecture titled WHY WE OCCUPY, points out that there's "no First Amendment in England." Palast, whose exposes are "front page news all over the world- except HERE," suggests that We (Americans) can "loan them OURS, since we're not using it." THE CAMPAIGN, coming as it does well after the fact, doesn't really amount to much: it's little more than an extended television skit. It would've been helpful had it come along, say, a decade ago, when what Amy Goodman calls THE SILENCED MAJORITY had been effectively silenced by the two-headed but One Party Political System that rules this country. A cameo by Ms. Goodman or Chris Hedges or Palast or any one of a dozen other noteworthy Truthsayers would've gone a long way to making THE CAMPAIGN watchable; instead, what we get is mostly low-brow slapstick that only underscores the kind of programming we're seeing in this company- er, country- these days. It would've been good to see villainaires like Pat Robertson (the televangelist whose diamond mines in Africa were being guarded by alleged cannibal-murderer Charles Taylor) taken to task. There are a lot of crooks involved in politics; THE CAMPAIGN doesn't even BEGIN to mine the heavily-fertilized field.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CAMPAIGNThe movie "The Campaign " was a good movie for plain entertainment especially for people who like simple plots to follow and humor. I enjoyed this movie because it had comedy. Comedy from my perspective is one of themes that would make a movie great and this movie had it. This movie was good in comedy perspective because some of the actors were put in scenarios were they had to things that were funny and also had crude humor; I also enjoy crude humor so that is another reason why I enjoyed this movie. Also for a fun fact it showed that most people that were 18 and younger enjoyed it more and which might say that younger will enjoy it better . Additionally, I enjoyed the plot of the movie because is was easy to follow and comprehend. Also the plot made it easy to enjoy the other parts of the movie like the humor part, even the somewhat serious, and also serious moments that had been put into the film. For the people who like really big plots and hard plots to follow I'm sorry but this is film would not be recommended for you. In conclusion to this paragraph, I would say that people who would like easy plots and crude comedy this would be a film for you.Although this film would not be good for children especially for the inappropriate behavior that have been shown in this film. I thought that the film was a little to short than what I expected. The film was all of the same comedy and didn't change much during the film, but that was sort of expected,and exceeded my expectations for the crude jokes in this film. To finish this paragraph I would say that children should not see this. On the other hand, I did enjoy the star actors who were Will Ferrel, Zack Galifinakis , and Jason Sudeikis. I Especially enjoyed Will Ferrel and Zack Galifinakis because they are always good at comedy and making me laugh and enjoy the movie. I also have to give a thanks to the director Jay Roach who came up with the idea to make this good movie. I believe he made a good decision to add those actors especially for their reputation and being good reputations. In conclusion, I did indeed enjoy this movie because it had comedy which I enjoyed and a plot that was easy to follow, but would not recommend to children. I you want to see this movie and have a sense for crude humor and easy plot this is a must see movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Generally not a fan of Will Ferrel movies. I like Will as a comedian, but somehow, his starring movie roles tend to be too one dimensional. The Campaign is a story about political sponsorship - how big money influences or directs political elections in America. It is exaggerated for effect here - with the corporations treating their sponsorship as outright buying the candidates.It's OK for a one-time watch. I got lured into the movie after seeing a clip on The Daily Show - the truly funny sequence where Will Ferrel and Zach Galifianakis rush to kiss a baby as part of their electoral race. In the heat of the competition, Will accidentally punches the baby instead. It was a funny scene, but it seemed to be the only legitimately funny scene in the movie.

		<fullReview>"The Campaign" is your classic Will Ferral, Zack Galifianakis, over the top raunchy comedy. But in all honesty, I was actually quite let down with this one. I found the whole film to be really quite ridiculous.The plot of this movie was far too unbelievable for me. It tells the bizarre story of two completely insane candidates at opposite extremes who are both running in the congressional race for the fourteenth district of North Carolina. The wacky antics that these two were up to during the election were just crazy; they were too far fetched and therefore diminished the value of the political satire effect that they were going for.Both of the main characters were quite similar in the sense that they were both stupid and unoriginal. I firmly believe that poor Zack Galifianakis is officially type-cast and will have a very difficult time breaking away from the stupid and naive characters he's always forced to portray. Will Ferral was very vulgar and raunchy in this movie, something that he's used to playing as well. I really hope that these two actors can break their cycles soon because if that's the type of acting were going to be subjected to in every movie, I think I'll just stop paying attention to them. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the acting of Jason Sudeikis. He did the best he could with what he was given. The role as a little out there and he had a lot to deal with but he handled it well. I will admit that he and Ferral did have some pretty good on screen chemistry.To conclude, this movie could have and should have been a lot better. It had some big names hen it comes to the comedy genre -Ferral, Galifianakis and Sudeikis; so it should have been really funny. In my opinion, it wasn't. Don't get me wrong, there are a handful of genuinely funny scenes that served as a few good laughs. But with names like these involved, there should have been far more. This film tried to be both a political satire and a goofy comedy but in reality became a muddled mess and fell short delivering on both accounts.In my opinion, it's really not that funny so if you're looking for a good laugh, this is a film that you should steer clear of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two great comedy leads, great supporting actors and a sound premise. How could it go wrong?There's a kind of whackiness for whackiness sake that's been peddled in a certain genre of comedy films since Napoleon Dynamite. I personally think it's had its day now. It worked on some level originally because it was unique and stylish, but we've seen it all before, know what's coming, and unless it's done damned well, it wears thin pretty quickly. Well poor old Zack G seems to have been permanently typecast in those kind of roles which is a shame cos I think he's capable of much better. Here again they roll him out all zany and effeminate, wearing whacky clothes, saying/doing whacky things(not funny things mind, just whacky things), whacky wife, whacky dogs, whacky kids. Yes the whackometer is on full throttle.Will Ferrel's got a better and more believable character - IMO a mongrel of everything else I've seen him in. At least it's a tried and tested formula and raises a couple of laughs.I know it's just a comedy but could've done with less whackiness and more background on the characters - specially ZG's - he just seemed like a random factor with elastic morals throughout the movie.For me, the story just wasn't fleshed out well enough, very predictable and low octane humour indeed.I don't know why Aykroyd/Lithgow bothered turning up cos there was just no material for them.You could milk the hell out of that premise with those actors and that budget but this was just badly written by someone with no imagination and a sense of humour that should preclude them from getting anywhere near comedy film scripts.I was really looking forward to this movie but wish I hadn't watched it now.</fullReview>

This is a much better movie than Dinner For Schmucks (an easy task), but it's still an inconsistent comedy. In spite of the fact that the script is flat, and the supporting cast is hit and miss (Dylan McDerrmott being a big hit), there are some good laughs in this movie, certainly more than I was expecting. Most of that comes from the butting heads rivalry between Will Ferrell and Zack Galifianakis, the highlights of which are debates that decently satirize modern politics. I got a kick out of a prayer Ferrell makes with the help of Jason Sudeikis. However, not all of the laughs hit their marks, and the movie feels like it moves a bit too quickly. As is, it's entertaining stuff, albeit forgettable.**1/2 / *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good political satire with plenty of laughs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Campaign is a workable comedy in which Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis are committed to playing two Southerners vying for a seat in Congress. They do just about anything to win. It's a surprise but this comedy delivers a good deal of laughs. When I watched the trailer I didn't expect much. Still, the film does lose some steam in the second half. Ferrell managed to turn his sex-hungry Democrat Cam Brady into a likable and very funny character. Here he does for the Lord's Prayer what Leslie Nielsen did for the National Anthem in The Naked Gun (1988). And I have to mention that Ferrell is perhaps the best comedian of his generation. Galifianakis isn't far behind as the child-like Republican Marty Huggins, who's promoted by the Motch brothers. At first sight you may think that there's no way that he can win. But this is American politics, and with the help of his campaign manager Tim Wattley (Dylan McDermott) and a pile of money he becomes a worthy opponent. As the campaign heats up the two candidates become aware that their family lives are being affected. Brady's wife Rose (Katherine LaNasa) predictably leaves him when his ratings plummet. Huggins's wife Mitzi (Sarah Baker) also becomes frustrated when her husband begins to spend a lot less time at home. But this is a film in which almost every situation is played for laughs. In conclusion, I enjoyed watching the film, and it's easily one of the funniest comedies of the year. It includes punching babies, a sex tape, and a hot chubby wife. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Enough Real Satire in This Campaign But the Two Leads Deliver the Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If not for the hilarious turns from stars Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis, this raucous 2012 comedy would be another toothless satire about our current political system. There is something fierce about the fearlessness in their play-acting that makes you wish the screenplay by Chris Henchy and Shawn Harwell had gone for the jugular a lot more than it does under Jay Roach's ("Meet the Fockers") pedestrian direction. Ironically, Roach directed two sharp-eyed HBO films, the recent Sarah Palin-skewering "Game Change" and the Bush-Core hanging chad saga "Recount", both of which clearly brought forth the Machiavellian nature of the electoral process within the context of actual political history. Without the context of real-life events, at least beyond the infamous Koch brothers, Roach retreats into a big-screen version of a "Saturday Night Live"-style sketch comedy with plenty of sight gags but frankly not enough jabs at the current state of political advertising.Ferrell plays Cam Brady, a four-term congressman from North Carolina's fictional 14th congressional district, who runs unopposed until a sexually explicit phone message he left for his mistress gets broadcast to the media. This act motivates the powerful Motch brothers, who basically own the district, to find the only candidate they could find at the last minute, Marty Huggins, a small-town travel agent who happens to be the unintended scion of a longtime political family in the state. Initially inept as a politician, Huggins becomes groomed by Machiavellian campaign manager Tim Wattley to reshape Huggins' life. Then the movie becomes a series of one-upmanship between Huggins and Brady that escalates into backstabbing tawdriness. These scenes are particularly hilarious, for instance, Brady's butchering of "The Lord's Prayer" during the first debate, Huggins being connected in Brady's commercials to Saddam Hussein just because of his moustache (shades of Trump's birthing campaign against Obama), and Brady's baby-punching gaffe (repeated over and over again in faux-news coverage).My favorite scene is a throwaway montage where the Huggins family takes a break and reverts to their Twinkie-swilling, pug-caressing ways for one evening. As funny as these episodes are, I was hoping there would be more of a political edge to the comedy. It all feels a few steps behind the surreal realities of the current campaign, meaning provocative parody was intentionally bypassed for a risk-free gagfest that doesn't linger that long in the memory. Ferrell and Galifianakis easily deliver all the expected laughs as Brady and Huggins, although when the film gives off a whiff of pathos (e.g., Brady's meltdown in the office), the film simply feels off-track. Dylan McDermott is effectively slimy as Wattley, while Dan Ackroyd and John Lithgow have a good time playing the erudite Motch brothers (recalling the Duke brothers from Ackroyd's 1983 comedy with Eddie Murphy, "Trading Places"). Personally, I got tired of Karen Maruyama's running gag as a maid faking a Deep South accent, but Katherine LaNasa and Sarah Baker were quite good as the campaign wives. Undemanding viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a HUGE Will Ferrell fan as well as Zack G, so I can't really blame myself for having high expectations. This movie was a complete disaster. I don't like politics to begin with, and was hoping to get a good laugh at them mocking politicians. They seemed like they would be a comedy dream team, but I ended up laughing maybe a total of two times in the entire (and seemingly never-ending) movie. I fell asleep at the end, which I almost never do. I just gave up hoping for it to end up being good. It literally seemed to drag on and on, and Will looked like he knew it wasn't good and was trying hard to make up for it by pulling out all his comedy bag of tricks. I don't know how this ended up into such a terrible mess of a movie but I tell everyone that loves Will Ferrell like I do to not watch it as it might ruin their opinion of him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a common secret that Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis do not have the quality of Peter Sellers or Jack Lemon. However, they do have the ability to make you laugh(if you do not have very serious demands of what you see). Unfortunately, "The Campaign" proved that you have to think more than twice if you want to spend a couple of hours watching films with these guys. Not, because they are untalented (even if their talents are not vast), but because they are type-casted as protagonists in movies addressed to toddlers. Ferrell does what he normally does, mugging and shouting without any reason justified by the "plot"...Galifianakis is much more consistent to his role but the script seems to be written in one evening, following the typical formula of modern Hollywood "comedies", which are produced with no sense of what cinema really is and with the meaning of talent in total absence. I'm sure that even an 8 year old child could produce a much more clever story than this. Please let me understand why this film was shot. Will anybody of the participants can feel proud of it at the future or it will be unforgettable? I m sure that there are thousands of comedies much better than this, even with less than the 1% of the budget used for "The Campaign".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Piece of Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few cheap laughs in this movie but ultimately it's a piece of garbage. This is what you get from Hollywood, these days, when the subject matter is "politics". The "film" is set in North Carolina so you get the typical NYC/LA stereotype that everyone from that state is a bible thumping, gun toting booger eating inbred moron. And Will Farrell's obscene character? More of the same. I know this was intended to be an over-the-top farce but it contains no wit, no real humor, and nothing clever; just non-stop gutter jokes. Of course, the moral of the story is that evil corporations, the republicans, and money are the root of all evil. This movie accurately represents the intellect, morality, and character of Hollywood today. It's basically waste that should be flushed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no need to use 1000 words to review this film. One word suffices; awful. Base, totally lacking in nuance of any sort, this film not only disappoints on every level (bar the 'punched a baby' moment)but has been marketed and advertised in a misleading way. I attended expecting a satiric comedy centred on election campaigns (how it's advertised) and watched a boring, un-funny and ultimately repulsive film, until I walked out. The scene where Will Ferrel's character has sex in the fridge (????) with his opponents wife is gross and vile, not to mention completely unbelievable; OK it's a comedy but even in the context of this film this 'storyline' is massively ridiculous as is everyone's reactions to the event. I did not tick the spoiler alert button at the top as there is nothing in this film to spoil. Spend you money elsewhere; this film is just totally horrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE CAMPAIGN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis combine forces for this political satire attempting to throw some comedic commentary at audiences this election season. Ferrell plays a North Carolina congressman running for his 5th term unopposed when two corrupt businessmen try to unseat him by pitting him against a naive tourism director who always had dreams of a career in politics, played by Galifianakis. The film was directed by Jay Roach (director of all three 'AUSTIN POWERS' films and the first two of the 'MEET THE PARENTS' franchise) and written by Chris Henchy and Shawn Harwell (one of the writers of the TV series 'EASTBOUND &amp; DOWN'). It was produced by Ferrell, Roach, Galifianakis and Adam McKay and co-stars Jason Sudeikis, Dan Aykroyd, John Lithgow, Brian Cox and Dylan McDermott. The film is funny for the most part and does have some on target political commentary. Not as classic as some of Ferrell's greatest comedies but one of his better ones for sure.Ferrell plays Democratic Congressman Cam Brady, who as the film opens is getting ready to secure his fifth term in North Carolina's 14th District unopposed. A sex scandal hurts his popularity though and two greedy businessmen named Glen (Lithgow) and Wade Motch (Aykroyd) see an opportunity to unseat him and put a naive tourism director, named Marty Huggins (Zak Galifianakis), in his place to do their bidding for them (which involves illegal business with Chinese corporations). What starts out as a friendly campaign duel turns in to a heated battle very quickly with all the name calling and ugly accusations you'd expect from a big time political election. This causes havoc on both the men's private lives including heavy drama with their families.The movie's jokes are somewhat hit-and-miss but for the most part work. They're vulgar but not overly dumbed down; neither Ferrell nor Galifianakis ever break character or overact (like what often happens in comedy satires like these). The film is of course supposed to be funny and lighthearted but the messages of the story are very serious and clear. The Motch brothers are obviously an intended diss at corrupt businessmen Charles and David Kotch (who Galiafanakis recently annoyed by calling creepy). Hopefully viewers who are fence sitters or leaning to the right might learn some valuable lessons from the film (one can hope). This is where the film's greatest strengths lie but it is pretty funny as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2vhN3UBteY</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferrell's Campaign.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Campaign (2012): Dir: Jay Roach / Cast: Will Ferrell, Zach Galifianakis, Jason Sudeikis, Dylan McDermott, Katherine LaNasa: Warped comedy about the deceit often associated with elections. Will Ferrell plays Cam Brady, a congressman in North Corolina who has gone unopposed for years until naive family man Marty Huggins, played by Zach Galifianakis is convinced to run against him by sources whose reasons are for greed. As predicted, Brady views this as a threat or intrusion to his cozy lifestyle and back and forth they go in competing. Huggins is led by others in his lewd suggestions while Brady uses vengeful tactics such as sleeping with his opponent's wife. This is all very crass and vulgar but its humour is on target with its subject. That could be part in due that Jay Roach previously made the Austin Powers films as well as the underrated Dinner for Schmucks. Ferrell plays Brady as a knock on George W. Bush, and in his competing state he manages to punch a baby in the face as well as put a dog in a neck brace. Galifianakis makes a great foil trying to do the right thing while being drawn to the wrong decisions. Supporting roles are unfortunately flat including the underused Jason Sudeikis as Brady's campaign assistant who has seen funnier days in other comedies. Dylan McDermott is also cardboard as some sort of enforcer out to influence one of the parties for the benefit of a higher source. It addresses the sincerity of political figures and the charades they present for votes. The jokes are often offensive but it works effectively on the vague promises made to ensure our vote.

		<shortDescription>Brilliant bits dragged down by sloppy writing/scenario work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Summary" sez all, but I guess IMDb requires me to flesh it in, so here goes.It's kinda sad, and I guess a sort of lesson in the evils of marketing: Why call yourself "Funny or Die" unless you're trying to hide something?The film has flashes of absolute brilliance; the kind of stuff that's a decent conceptual foundation for an amazing tour-de-force of comedy and even social relevance.Then, it starts creeping in. First, there are scenes that sort of develop the thesis, tho they seem a bit weak. But, since the thesis is solid, you're willing to bend a bit, accept those weak scenes as "boffo", or "pushing the envelope". But then... the bomb drops. The writers/editors create/permit something that stinks up the place. And the magic spell evaporates. And this happens, again and again.The acting/directing/editing/production values in general are excellent. The work by the venerable faces is, of course, impeccable; and the new faces aren't too chabby, either.It's just a shame that all that talent gets ritualistically flushed down the tubes by shoddy values in scenario work.Try something like this again, and this time, hold that line: If a quip or scenario _feels_ ill-considered, don't give it another thought. Keep the tone sharp, on-the-edge, challenging, smart, and... FUNNY.Or die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Making a comedy out of a political setting, the movie kind of raises both Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis's character images from the stupid crazy comedians in Anchorman, Step Brothers, and also the Hangover, to cleverer yet sleazier characters. Yet the movie falls to be quite predictable since the story soon falls into the characters exchanging blows at the campaign ad messages. The ending proves to be a joke for real politicians despite they don't crack any laugh from the audience. The acting overall is a little bit above the standards. Will Ferrell is really no stranger to comedies like this while Zach Galifianakis maintained his age old flat face expressions. Jason Sudeikis' presence here feels like a waste</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low-brow, but fun political satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that, living in Britain and being brought up on such classics as 'Yes, Minister' and 'The Thick of It,' the bar has been raised pretty high when it comes to political satire. The Campaign is about two political rivals, vying to be Senator in America. It's not as clever as either of the British TV shows; it's more low-brow and slapstick - definitely not as clever. However, it's still good in its own way.Will Ferrell is on form as one slimy Senator and Zach Galifianakis is equally amusing as his hapless and dopey rival. It's daft, enjoyable fun that anyone can enjoy with plenty of laugh out loud moments.It really doesn't matter who wins as the story comes secondary to seeing the two leads send up politicians in general for the lying, patronising, amoral, self-serving cads they are with their polished manufactured image and double-standards (I could go on).Maybe The Campaign is a sad sign of the times? Once upon a time politicians were respected figures of authority. Now they're so unpopular that they're easy fodder to be sent up - and we enjoy seeing them presented like this.It may not be a classic, but it has enough 'laugh out loud' moments to make it definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My thoughts....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thought: Considering the rather effeminate voice Zach Galifianakis puts on throughout the film and his generally annoying personality, perhaps it ought to be retitled The Camp Pain. Tee Hee.Second Thought: There's at least 20 minutes of BRILLIANT comic material here. Only problem is, the film runs for just under an hour and a half... So for every hilarious party political broadcast of Will Ferrell shagging his opponent's wife, we get lots of random unfocused crap like Ferrell being bitten by a snake in a church. Of course, humour is subjective, so what I find hysterical you may not even crack a smile at. But I'm right.Third thought: Is every voter in this film a moron? These two use the most obvious electioneering tactics known to man by obsessing about patriotism, Jesus and 9/11, yet those stupid Yanks fall for it hook, line and sinker with nary a dissenting voice in sight. Yes, I know the average redneck isn't known for his smarts, but c'mon... these dudes are as transparent as a ghost, you'd think ONE person would be able to figure out their agenda. But apparently not.Final Thought: I think I'll have a Wispa.Final Thought After The Final Thought(!) So all in all, pretty mediocre. Better than Welcome To Mooseport, at least. No, I bet you haven't heard of it. 5/10</fullReview>

The plot revolves around the clichéd idea of a good guy &amp; a bad guy competing in elections. Their vulgar approaches will make you laugh, their dialogs will make you laugh, their ribald actions will make you laugh. The craziness involved is so satirical, I give it a servile 7.3/10.Music is kinda groovy with the soundtrack good enough for the spoof theme, direction is usual, cast performance is great, and really nice editing. The jokey dialogs and healthy references to movies are too good to digest.BOTTOM LINE: If you have a thing for run-down spoofing comedies on serious topics, The Campaign will blow your mind.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

		<shortDescription>A Pretty Good Skewering Of The System</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good satire has to strike the difficult balance of being obviously satirical, and yet, at the same time, surprisingly (and perhaps frighteningly) realistic. Good satire is reality magnified to ridiculous extremes. For the most part, I have to say that "The Campaign" manages to rise to the status of good satire. While it's clearly a comedy - and not to be taken seriously at all - it does a magnificent job of lampooning all the troublesome aspects of American politics, and it makes you laugh at the absurdity of it all, while at the same time you shake your head because you know that behind the absurdity the movie is actually raising some very valid issues.Will Ferrell plays Congressman Camden Brady. Brady is a four term Congressman, who expects to win a fifth term unopposed. He's grown complacent in Washington. As he himself eventually says, he doesn't really want to do anything or achieve anything, and he hardly ever votes and he never reads bills. He just likes being a Congressman. But he gets caught in a scandal a few weeks before election and his approval ratings drop. In response his big money corporate backers (John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd) drop him and turn to mild-mannered Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis) - a low key tourism booster for his local town, who they figure will be putty in their hands. Once Brady discovers that he's being opposed, the gloves come off, and Huggins gets a crash course in dirty politics, and turns out to be pretty good at it himself as Huggins and Brady go toe to toe all the way to election day, with no holds barred.Pretty much everything gets skewered in this movie. Big money's dominance of the system, the problem of professional politicians, the lack of focus on issues as candidates decide to tear each other down personally, the makeover of candidates to make them seem as if they're someone they're really not, negative attack ads. You know it isn't real, but you see nevertheless see reality being reflected.The two leads are both pretty good. I thought Galifianakis carried the movie, mind you. Ferrell was fine, but the character of Huggins was a more interesting character to watch as the movie went on, as he struggled with the good he wanted to do as a congressman, even while he was being turned into just another candidate by those pulling the strings.This weakened a bit at the end by becoming (predictably, I suppose) too noble - and by doing that, it lost its satirical bite. Still, for most of the way through it's a pretty good job of skewering the system, and pointing out some of the deep flaws in American democracy. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Knowing Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis casted in a movie, viewers had already known what a mess would happen to that movie. 'The Campaign' is ridiculous, silly and no education movie but still quite fun to see. Thing that could exceptionally be seen is the performance from their two main casts. Ferrell as usual played an almost the same character like his previous movie, a loud and no brain congressman. While Galifianakis played as a more education congressman although he's still having a little problem in his mind. With that two crazy actors are combined in a movie, made 'The Campaign' is funny but mostly dumb though. I couldn't stand laughing when Cam Brady accidentally punched a baby with the slow motion effect, it's so funny. What makes me disappointed about these is that the movie is not serious, mostly for jokes and not educated. How could people vote to that two ridiculous congressman? If I was citizen, I would never vote for them. I'm sure their district still have a smart and responsible guy who could lead. And the ending is also too forced and not special at all. Overall, 'The Campaign' is fun and enjoyable adult comedy politics movie to see. But with a standard and dumb storyline, this movie could go nowhere to win audience's heart who seeks something new and it easily forgets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Accurate Than Most Documentaries About Politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been involved in politics for over ten years, having run twice, been elected once, and worked on a half-dozen campaigns. Except for the large part of the story where the two main characters have direct contact with each other, this is, by far, the most accurate movie made about the process of political campaigning. Not, mind you, because it shows candidates to be shallow, or dumb; the percentage of candidates who are shallow or dumb is about the same as the percentage of people generally who are shallow or dumb. Rather, it is accurate because it mines for its humor many of the silly and absurd aspects that all campaigns tend to have. From candidates who think awful ads make them look good, to public gaffes having reverse effects on popularity, to the ceaselessly vulgar language that is the base vocabulary of every campaign staffer, this movie made me laugh at things I am not at all sure most people would even recognize as intentionally funny.A lot of the film involves the candidates interacting with each other, and their family members, in ways that don't ever really happen. Those parts weren't as good. (Although a scathingly funny exception is the moment when the two of them shake hands just before a debate, and have a moment to exchange a few pleasantries that only they will hear and, yes, we actually do that.) Overall, however, this movie must have been made by someone who has been on the inside for a few real campaigns. If you want good fiction about politics, see "The Candidate." If you want light humor and you don't care about honesty, maybe try "Welcome to Moosewood." But if you know campaigns from the inside and you need a moment to laugh at yourself and the process, this is your movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely hate Will Ferrell, but I love Zach Galifianakis, even still, the Campaign is not usually the type of movie I would watch, so why did I? What put this film over the top and on to my radar, was it's Director, Jay Roach. He may not have name recognition, but when the man who Directed the Austin Powers and Meet The Parents trilogies releases a new comedy, I for one take notice. The Campaign is also different from most Ferrell movies, being that it has a storyline, and he is a co-star, lessening the chances of him running off on some insane hallucination. Ferrell plays four term Congressman, Cam Brady, a wildly popular brown nose, who is hated by the opposing party. He's about to get a fifth term, unopposed, when a group of millionaires decide to fiancé a campaign against him, featuring the son of a legend in Washington. There's one problem though, this man's son, is a complete idiot. As the campaign rages it's the veteran politician against his haters money and both sides will go to any and all lengths to win. This movie was a million times better than I thought it would be and absolutely hysterical. The writers take the idea of a dirty campaign and bring it to the extreme, with some things that have to be seen to be believed. Zach Galifianakis doesn't disappoint, giving us perhaps his best character since Alan in the Hangover, and to give credit where credit is due, yes, Will Ferrell matched him line for line, in what was the only thing I've liked him in since Elf. The film is further supported by some comedic legends in bit parts, making it a terrific, well-rounded comedy, that uses multiple styles to achieve it's goal of having the audience in hysterics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been better directed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is about two candidates for the US Congress, Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) and Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis) in the run-up to their district's election. Brady initially runs unopposed but then his campaign backers, the Motch brothers, thought they needed somebody who's easier to control and recruited Huggins to run opposite him.This plot has some potential and it deserves a better execution than this film. Some of the roles feel unnecessarily being highlighted, while some others warrant better exposition.For example the Motch brothers could have been utilized less, as it's difficult to expand these roles anyway.There is also the reaction of the characters around the leading roles that could have been managed better. There was one instance where Huggins and his wife make up after a crisis in their relationship. They kiss in a very unusual way, yet two of Huggins' staff who are watching react as if it's the most regular thing they've ever seen.On a positive note, Ferrell and Galifianakis did well in their respective roles. Katherine LaNasa who plays Brady's wife was appropriate as the ambitious wife of a politician.To close, not one of Jay Roach's strongest directorial work.</fullReview>

By the time I saw the movie, I knew it was good. Will and Zach are masters at making people laugh, for me. But the problem was the story was a little too fast. A lot of the sex jokes never made me laugh at all. Most of the jokes that made me crack up was the ones that weren't about sex. Also, some of the cursing wasn't necessary too. The movie was great but the rating could've been lower by erasing the sex jokes, some cursing and a bit of the nudity. IMDb's rating was based on the story but seriously, give it a break. The movie wasn't for an Oscar or anything like that. It was to make people laugh. "The Campaign": good humour, sort-of-cheap story, great acting. Worth to watch.</fullReview>

He takes bribes, doesn't show up to vote in congress, has a hot wife but is always cheating. In the upcoming election, he has competitor, Marty Huggins. Zach G is funny as Marty. He's got these pugs, a quite wife, and kids that admit to some crazy things at dinner. Cam punches a dog and baby and mixes it up with Marty's wife. Yet some how Marty isn't too upset. Also Cam's sexy call to the preacher's wife was really funny.FINAL VERDICT: It's got some funny parts. Worth a viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delivers for it's intended audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie makes good it's promise: raunchy, foul-mouthed humor, amusing moments, and a chemistry between Will and Zach that provides some real laughs without much of a story. The audience this film is intended for will be more than pleased. If you loved "Step Brothers" (2008), this is right up your alley. This is simply a stage for two prominent comedians to slug it out--and it has it's moments. North Carolina's district 14 is about to elect a new Congressman. Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) is running unopposed for a fifth consecutive term. After an affair and a massive scandal that follows, Brady's approval rating drops to the point where the billionaire Motch brothers find a candidate to replace him. They choose Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis), the son of a famous republican, to run against Brady. The ending is ridiculous in attempting some kind of unity of people, and delivering a "message" after 85 minutes of never ending offensive jokes and gags. It is what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Anchorman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know. I seriously doubt that Will Ferrell knows how to make a scene that rings true, at least in his comedies. His character is less stupid than his Anchorman character but only by a small margin.As for the rest of the movie, well, I laughed a little bit but almost all of the jokes have been used in similar projects, like Black Sheep and Bulworth. The comedy is seriously forced and why does there have to be that terrible epilogue where once again, Will Ferrell is allowed to be, well, Will Ferrell.Zach G (Sorry, forgot how to spell his last name) does his best with a character that you will probably only find in movies. You have to write him as too good to be true, otherwise the evil that lurks behind him doesn't have the same effect. Here's where Dylan McDermott's Tim Wattley comes in. Seriously, did they really borrow his name from Seinfeld or is it just an unbelievable coincidence. Never mind. McDermott does an admirable job of making a fool of himself but I doubt that there is an award for him in the near future.John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd also show up and for what? Don't know and neither did the screenwriters apparently. It feels tacked on.There's not much else to say. It wasn't worth the rental price. Ferrell can be good if he is reigned in by a decent director. I am surprised that Jay Roach directed this because he has made a few good ones before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny but has been done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was some really funny parts in this comedy that pins Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis against each other. I must say the chemistry between the characters was fantastic but to be completely honest much of it has been done before. Will Ferrels role seems very similar to the one he played as Ron Burgandy in Anchorman. That being said I refuse to ignore the fact that when it was original, It was hilarious!! Very few men can play a character that people can love for being despised. Will Ferrell has a knack for hitting then nail right on the head when it comes to how far he can push what I can only refer to as "egotistical maniac behavior." That being said, I am certainly not running out to buy the movie but probably won't change the channel if its on t.v. either....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Campaign pits two comedic powerhouses in Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis against one another in a political satire. Ferrell is a congressman who has won his seat without contest for years until the large corporations bring in Galifianakis to replace him and to do their bidding. Director Jay Roach, who has delivered blockbusters like Meet The Fockers and Austin Powers, isn't bringing us something original as one is able to deduce where The Campaign is heading. That said, with two stars at the top of their game, the jokes come fast and thick! Audiences will forgive the predictability as they chuckle along wholeheartedly and walk away more than satisfied as Ferrell and Galifianakis deliver brilliantly. The Campaign is one to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE CAMPAIGN Earns a Positive Vote from Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What better movie for an election year when most people don't seem to have a whole lot of faith in either candidate than a movie about to half-wits running for government office. I didn't have a whole lot of interest in this movie from the start but this is an instance of decent reviews convincing me to give it a chance. In my experience, Will Ferrell movies can either be really good or really bad. And Zach Galifianakis hasn't changed his routine much since he hit it big with THE HANGOVER. What I had forgotten to account for was director Jay Roach, who is responsible for the Austin Powers franchise (a guilty pleasure of mine) and 2010's decent-enough DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS. By their comedy powers combined, they've created a pretty funny movie and released at a time when it's somewhat relevant. The movie is set in Hammond, NC where congressman Cam Brady (Ferrell) is preparing to run for his fifth term in office unopposed. Brady is a sleazebag who treats the position as an excuse to party on an executive level and his reputation is damaged when he's caught in a scandal after leaving a vulgar message on the answering machine of prim and proper religious family. His supporters and primary source of campaign finance, the Motch brothers, ditch their candidate in favor of some new blood. In this case, it's family man and Hammond director of tourism Marty Huggins (Galifianakis). The battle is on as the two candidates will go to any extreme to come out ahead in the polls, whether it be attacking their faith or seducing their opponent's wife.THE CAMPAIGN has a lot of potential material at hand: smear campaigns, sleazy activities, and campaign financers with shady dealings. I am happy to report that Roach and his team handle it well. I was worried that the movie would take shortcuts for easy laughs. Ferrell is known for his loud, obnoxious morons and Galifianakis is generally quiet, weird, and na?ve to the ways of the world. Both of them are playing to type, but it still comes off fun because each of their personas is almost polar opposite of the other. Ferrell's Cam Brady is boisterous, ignorant, and a professional when it comes to pandering to the crowd. Even with his scandals, he maintains a hold on his demographic voters with constant references to freedom, America, and Jesus. His southern charm almost recalls his impressions of George W. Bush from his days on SNL. Galifianakis as Marty Huggins is just a big lovable doofus. He's an absolute family man with a wife and two little boys (who aren't as wholesome as their dad might want to believe, as he learns over a family dinner), and the only thing he loves more than his family is the town of Hammond, NC. When the Motch brothers approach Huggins to run for office, he sees it as an opportunity to do right by his community. But Huggins isn't prepared for what the world of cutthroat politics entails.THE CAMPAIGN works better than most recent comedies because the gags don't feel forced and, unlike other movies (I'm looking at you, WANDERLUST), the jokes don't go on painfully long. The joke hits, we get a good laugh, and then the movie is off to the next setup. It's a slim comedy with little extra stuffing bogging it down. At a mere 85 minutes, the movie flies through the campaign without stopping to bore you with extraneous subplots or over-long improv sessions. Some of the best laughs come from Dylan McDermott as Tim Wattley, the campaign manager for Marty Huggins' campaign. He appears from the shadows, giving firm advice and demanding total dedication from his candidates. When Huggins agrees to run on the ballot, Wattley becomes a part of the Huggins world and starts the family with a total overhaul. You know, to make them "more American." As funny as McDermott is, the funniest moments are in the debate sequences. The debates are absolutely hilarious with each opponent digging up any little bit of dirt they can to shame their opponent in front of a live audience. THE CAMPAIGN is an easy recommendation for most. Ferrell and Galifianakis fans are bound to be satisfied, and people who might normally avoid them might just be surprised at how funny the movie is. THE CAMPAIGN is a funny movie and, as icing on the cake, we get Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow as the evil Motch brothers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can We Still Vote for Pedro?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't slap me. I like Will Ferrell, but he's not my favorite. In fact, if you asked me to nominate, or vote for, in this case, a better comedian, it would be Zach Galifianakis.The Campaign is so over the top, it's hard to say this is a spoof of the normal election campaigns. Specifically, 2012's Republican buffoon races. It's so out there, that they really dropped the ball at making true fun of how badly the real-life candidates did this past election.At any rate, it is what it is: a cartoon of elections. Unopposed, and clichéd sex maniac, Congressman Cam Brady (Ferrell) is being challenged by flamboyant ? and that's putting it mildly, newcomer, Marty Huggins (Galifianakis.) The only reason Marty's in the race is because, well, to make it short, politics are dirty. And that's not even part of the story, but real life. Really?who disagrees with me?So, once Marty is splashed into the spotlight, let the site gags prevail, including the punching of both a baby and a dog. It's just one outrageous scene after another, so unbelievable, this might as well be a live-action Looney Toons cartoon than a comedy to be taken genuinely for a moment.And when the blows hit the fan in the "learned lesson" inevitable finale, the movie tries to reclaim some of its audience with some kind of lesson that doesn't flow with the rest of the farce.The movie should've begun with the warning: "Do NOT take this seriously, even the closing. Do leave your brain at the door. And Do NOT try any of this in your district."Watch the enjoyable parts with Galifianakis. Discard, er, vote out, the rest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Campaign was a nice entertainment with hilarious moments tickling your funny bone coupled with wonderful performance by Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis.To make North Carolina a better place to live , Marty Huggins must compete against his arch rival Cam Brady to win the congressman seat. Directed by Jay Roach ( Meet the parents, Meet the Fockers), The Campaign was a good comedy with political satire at its best. You will find it weird , hilarious , sometimes over-the-top but at moments engrossing. The story is different which has not been attempted before and that is what makes the film stand out. When you are directing comedians like Will Ferrel and Zach Galifianakis , the direction takes a back seat and its more of how to create funny situation between the actors and Jay Roach succeeds in doing this. Screenplay is like a rollercoster ride but balancing out at the end. Dialogues are good. Art direction is nice. Cinematography is decent. Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis both carries the film on their shoulder. Both of them have done a fantastic job in keeping you entertain and make sure you laugh till the end.Overall , a good political comedy with fantastic performances by Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis . Go for it . 3.5/5</fullReview>

Let's be honest the movie is enjoyable and some crazy things goes down between these two but it losses sense most of the times. When things get completely out of control like getting bitten by snake and then running like crazy in jungle, eating raccoons etc.Plus the ending was predictable from scene one, you just knew how it's going to end and it ends exactly like that. If only it had lowered the craziness and maintained realism of political campaign it would have been lot better. Will Farrell and Zach Galifianakis are great in their parts.Overall, strictly time pass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While that is not saying much, as last election drew over 20 million less voters than the 2008 election, this movie scores for some simple reasons. First of those is that they take out all the rules and do everything that is taboo in politics. Ironically some of the funniest bits involve the reality that slips into the plot. A major Corporation tries to buy a Congressional District Candidate and election. That itself is a bit too real.Will and Zach are the main stars of the movie and the candidates do bring off their roles well. In spite of throwing all the wild lines and actions they are the glue for this film. My viewing of the extended version did not feel the extension hurt the film at all.This is not a great movie, this is a film made for laughs and the laughs are here. There is some humor that is vulgar, but over all it works as a pleasant diversion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are you unhappy with the current state of American political discourse? Do you want an improvement, or would you settle for any change that came along? If so, you might enjoy this latest offering from Will Ferrell.Cam Brady (played by Ferrell) is a four term congressman who was about to run for a fifth term unopposed when, after dialing the wrong number, he leaves an explicit message for a woman other than his wife. The family who received the message released it to the press and, almost immediately, Brady's polling numbers began to decline. Elsewhere, wealthy businessmen Glen and Wade Motch (played by John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd) were looking to increase profits by moving their Chinese factory to Brady's district while leaving the conditions (i.e. toxic work environment and low wages) the same. That way, the Motch brothers (Lithgow and Aykroyd) would save on shipping. When Glen and Wade saw the difficulties Brady was experiencing, they decided to support the son of a powerful Republican. Once he was told, Marty Huggins (played by Zach Galifianakis) agreed, filled out the proper forms and entered the race. To increase Marty's chances of winning, his campaign manager Tim Wattley (played by Dylan McDermott) gave Marty, his family and his home a complete makeover. And so began a slew of scandalous photos, unfounded accusations, and embarrassing misstatements we've come to expect from a contemporary election.Now, I have liked some of Will Ferrell's other films. The most recent example is Stranger Than Fiction where he played a solitary IRS agent who begins to hear the voice of an omnipotent narrator detailing the events of his life. As for Galifianakis, I like him as a comedian but find him lacking as an actor. The supporting cast, Lithgow, Murray, McDermott, and Brian Cox who I neglected to mention, are talented and I am a big fan of all of them. Still, I didn't enjoy this film. Ferrell and Galifianakis played characters that, while funny, were not very interesting. Aykroyd and Lithgow playing characters obviously inspired by the Koch brothers are less amusing, but more interesting. There are better political comedies available on DVD. Watch one of those instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing with Will Ferral is the fact that he is very hit and miss. More miss lately.For every Anchorman and Elf, we get a Talledega Nights and Land of the lost. Of late, he has excelled more in bitter sweet dramas, but here, we lie somewhere in between funny and average.It's a topical movie, especially being released in a presidential race year, and here lies the main fault, it could have been so more risqué and really lambasted the US government, but instead, it goes for the usual Ferrall shtick and Galafianakas kookiness.The latter has never been better in a movie, he really is great in this, and doesn't overdo his persona, like he does in the awful Hangover movies.The set pieces are funny, and what makes films like this funny, isn't the stars, it's the random characters they bump into, or punch, through out their journey.Even though the film is a very dark streak running down it for the most part, it loses points at the end for falling into the schmaltz pot and going all sickly sweet for a happy ending.If I stayed dark all the way through, like other rival comedies, it could have been something.Instead, it's a mildly amusing comedy, with Ferrell being better than he has for a while, but it appears that the makers have not took many risks in order to offend anyone.Which it should have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politically Incorrect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Campaign" may have seemingly come out at the absolute perfect time, 2012 being an election year in the United States, but if one thought this film would be slamming Democrats against Republicans, they would be very misguided.Will Farrell stars as Cam Brady, a four-term incumbent North Carolinian Republican senator (simply because Republicans are much more funny) who has run unopposed and wins just by throwing himself into the ring. That is, until a powerful company has some devious plans of their own and convince Galifianakis' weirdo Marty Huggins to put his name on the ballot.And crazy, politically-incorrect chaos ensues.No doubt, the comedic timing of both the stars is a pitch-perfect as ever. Jason Sudeikis is excellent in his own right as Brady's sidekick and proves he may very well have life after SNL when he chooses to leave. Katherine La Nasa and Sarah Baker? Exemplary as the wives of the dueling candidates. And Dylan McDermott, hot off an incredible run on the first season of "American Horror Story," is dead-on as Huggin's almost-sociopathic campaign manager.The back and forth antics between Brady and Huggins are great...sometimes funny, sometimes flat, sometimes a little too much, but that is what everyone is watching this film for, right Overall, a terrific and timely comedy that is well worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Winning elections requires a measure of deceitfulness and Machiavellian immorality that no decent person comes close to possessing." - Mark TwainPoliticians and power are so proudly contemptuous of everyone, and politics so brazenly stupid, that satirizing the electoral process seems strangely pointless. The problem with political jokes is that they get elected, so how can one possibly concoct a character stupider than politicians seem to be? Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis have a go in "The Campaign", though. It's a lazy satire of American politics, its plot a mishmash of "Black Sheep", "Trading Places" and "The Candidate". Our comedians are a pair of rival politicians who lock horns in an attempt to win a local election, but their antics can't compete with the best of TV sitcoms. Some moments are funny ? Ferrell condescendingly calls Filipino carousel operators "the backbone of America", and reduces all his speeches to inane buzzwords ("Jesus, America, Freedom!") - but the film overall feels like a missed opportunity.The sad thing about "The Campaign", though, is that Ferrell and Galifianakis seem less, not more, ridiculous than contemporary politicians. Why are such inane figureheads so widespread? Power seems to both magnify and require idiocy, attract the worst types of people and social structures have long evolved such that only those who toe-the-line, and thereby perpetuate the institution in which they are embedded, rise through the ranks. We've also entered a period in which an air of buffoonery and clownishness (Bellusconi, Bush, Sarkozy etc wear "moron" like a badge of honour) is seen to be an asset. Such figureheads turn everything into a laughing mater to remove all hints of shame, and mask arrogance and corruption with comical clownishness. Old style authoritarianism has been replaced with buffoonery. The populace, meanwhile, manages the paradoxical feat of maintaining a belief in the clowns whilst simultaneously and cynically dismissing them."The Campaign" co-stars Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow as a pair of puppet masters who rig the film's elections in their favour. Representative of Big Business, they come out on top no matter who wins. One of the film's best jokes involve the duo promoting "more jobs in America" whilst essentially renaming a town in China "America". Genius. Unfortunately such witty jokes are few and far between.The film ends happily, our two rival politicians pulling a Capra, bonding together and cleaning up Washington. It's a big fantasy ending, which jaded audiences may not accept. Today politicians seem interested in people the way fleas are interested in dogs, and people, meanwhile, are interested in corruption only so far as they can get a piece of it.7/10 - Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Read my lips, now new puns! As most politicians do, that was a blatant lie. I will continue to cast my puns in movie reviews as in this one for the Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis comedic collaboration "The Campaign". The film stars the aforementioned as butting politicians running for a Congressional North Carolina seat. Ferrell plays long-term Congressman Cam Brady, who is running for his next term unopposed that is until two sibling CEO's seize an opportunity to dethrone Brady and his bunch from his seat by putting up funds for a rival candidate. That would come in the form of Marty Huggins played by Galifianakis. Huggins is not the brightest bulb in North Carolina, but the opportunity of his childhood dream of becoming a politician to become a reality is too good to pass up, so Marty decides to accept the candidacy even though the two CEO's do it for self-fulfilling economic reasons. What follows is a very comedic exploit and even satire of the political campaign game between a challenger and an incumbent doing whatever it takes for a win. The Brady Bill here in Cam is one of a bullying politician who has no interest in advocating for the people, but in just the divine pleasure of being a Congressman so he can continue to indulge in the vices of bedding women, lavishing fame, and other self-interest entertainment lavishes. Huggins on the other hand probably did not get enough bear hugs as a kid, due to his passive, but at times flamboyant, personality. In order to derail Brady from his seat, the CEO brothers contract the services of a devilish campaign manager Tim Wattley to head up Huggins' campaign. On the other side of the political spectrum, Brady's campaign is run by his longtime campaign manager Mitch; who does not mind getting involved in dirty campaign warfare but at times seems he has had it with the hypocrisy, lies, and deceit involved in a campaign. Director Jay Roach was in a state of representing in what entertaining political comedy should entail with his command of the picture, and one could make numerous comparisons from the political protagonists in the movie to many that have sat or still seat in the White House or in other governmental institutions. Screenwriters Chris Henchy and Shawn Harwell do get a bit silly and outlandish at times with the scribe, but that is justified because it comes with the territory; otherwise, it is a very funny script. Ferrell brought again his vintage "Willpower" with another hilarious performance; but if I had to cast a thespian vote between Will and Zach, it would go to Zach for his scene-stealing performance as Huggins. Others in Roach's supporting cast administration also helped have a good thespian party including Dylan McDermott as Wattley, Jason Sudeikis as Mitch, and Brian Cox as Huggins' disapproving father. My favorite comedy about the election process is still Alexander Payne's "Election"; and as good as "The Campaign" is, it does not hold up a candle to the brilliance of "Election". But nevertheless, "The Campaign" is very far from being a mess (to quote Marty Huggins) and is a viable candidate as one of the funniest movies of 2012. **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sporadically hilarious, highly predictable and consistently inconsistent and silly. Though it touches the right chords occasionally, the end product could have been a lot better than it turned out to be. Zach is perfectly cast who embraces his comfort zone of playing unaware of the fact being dimwitted, his conversation with his father on the boat easily being the best scene of the movie.Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) is an unopposed congressman for 4 consecutive terms who is sleazy, irresponsible and stubborn. The Motch brothers (John Lithgow &amp; Dan Aykroyd) are billionaires who plan to sell of District 14 to China and are looking for a willing candidate to sign the paperwork. They zero-in on Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis) a simple, dimwitted tram tourist guide but comes from a political family. When Marty shows up to nominate himself to compete against Cam Brady, the politics turn ugly.The movie is watchable only for Zach's trademark performance making all the silliness around him look practical. There are instances where the script tries to satire on current politics but soon resorts to physical and silly comedy. The climax is too predictable and sappy, they could have thought a lot better than this. The entire script becomes meaningless with one thought as to why Motch brothers didn't go Cam Brady in the first place. Farrell embraces his character as an over-the-top sleazy, foul mouthed politician but nothing worth a mention. The editing and finishing are slick, does get dragging occasionally and finally lacks enough firepower in writing department to make it a wholesome winner.Superb lead performances held back by an underwhelming script</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Average film at best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another one of those films that has great potential, and lots of great things working on its behalf; however, it just misses the mark in delivery. Although directed by Jay Roach (Meet the Parents / Austin Powers), Roach fails to give the audience the one thing this movie really needs, someone to root for, a hero, a protagonist!!! Will Ferrell is Cam Brady, the incumbent Senator of the 14 District of North Carolina. He is George H.W. Bush personified, with the libido of Bill Clinton. Cam's only interests are "chasing skirts" and retaining the title of "Senator". He has no platform, no concerning interests or loyalty to his party or his District; he just likes to be called Senator. Senator Brady was running unopposed, when an errant misdialed phone call placed Cam front and center in the public eye. During this same time frame, two mega-mogul CEOs, The Motch Brothers, played wonderfully by Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow, seize an opportunity to run an imbecile (Zach Galifianakis) against Cam Brady in order to bring Chinese industry / manufacturing companies to USA soil.Now here's the problem, and the issue with what really doesn't work with this film. Cam Brady is the seedy, corrupted, incumbent senator. Marty Huggins (Galifianakis) is the likable, na?ve candidate/puppet being manipulated by his diabolical campaign manager (played superbly by Dylan McDermont) who (if he wins) will be supporting BIG BUSINESS, and the destruction of his beloved District 14. So who is the audience suppose to cheer for??? The seedy incumbent with no redeeming qualities, or Big Business, and the destruction of District 14? it's a no win situation. Not to mention, that with everything that we end up learning about Cam Brady, there is no doubt in my mind that he would have lept at the opportunity to support the Motch Brothers from the beginning of this film with the right amount of "political campaign" support. Of course then the movie would have been a really, really short film. However, what was really distressing to me were the events which led up to the films climax. After all the negative campaigning on both sides, a moment of truth is revealed which actually was pivotal enough to sway public opinion to the correct candidate only to have the Motch Brother rig the election? so I have to ask myself again, what was the purpose of the first 75 minutes of this film, if the Motch Brothers could have elected any candidate they wanted in the first place? Anyways, not an awful film; however, not as good as it could have been. Filled with cameos from the cast of Saturday Night Live, the film does possess some funny moments. A political satire, but it's not in the same class of "The Ides of March" (which I highly recommend seeing **** out of 5). I would recommend waiting for this film to come out on DVD or PPV. An average film at best, but it's perfect viewing for this political / election time of the year.SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ "THE FARIS REEL"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The CampaignThe best thing about a political campaign is that it allows citizens the opportunity to obtain candidate DNA to prove paternity.However, this comedy about stumping for congress isn't so much about bastards as it is mudslinging.On the behest of his father (Brian Cox), Marty (Zach Galifianakis) enters the race for congress on the Republican ticket.With no experience, he is aligned with a cutthroat campaign manager (Dylan McDermott) who molds Marty into a threat towards sitting congressman Cam (Will Ferrell).With his incumbency endangered, Cam assassinates Marty's character. But Marty bites back, and things get sadistic.Meanwhile, Marty's backers (John Lithgow, Dan Aykroyd) plan to sell his hometown to China.A campaign trail mix of boorish humour, anti-Semitism, and an exhausted Bush impression from Ferrell, The Campaign fails in its promise of laughter.Fortunately, no matter how physical a campaign gets, both injured candidates can count on Obamacare.

		<shortDescription>The Campaign wasn't half bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's right, it wasn't half bad. Galifianakis &amp; Ferrell have plenty of jokes to offer, with Ferrell coming out on top as the most entertaining of the two politicians. However by far, my favorite character was the very cool and stylish Tim Wattley, played by the relatively unknown Dylan McDermott. He steals EVERY scene (look up his AGE it will surprise and impress you) he is the coolest, charismatic character in the entire film. Overall, despite an underwhelming ending, I definitely recommend this fresh take on the corrupt land that is US Politics. And as you will find out, this modern take on American election campaigns, and on American politics as a whole, is that there is not much difference between this film -based on fiction- and the real thing. My name is Lewis McCathie, and I approve this message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"America, Jesus, Freedom are this nation's backbone...Cam Brady in '012!!! Cam Brady (Ferrell) is running for his 4th term as congressman and once again is unopposed. When two greedy CEO's find a way to make more money from sweatshops they decide to handpick a candidate to run against him. They decide on the local tourism center director Marty Huggins (Galifianakis). What starts off as a joke quickly becomes more serious that anyone was expecting and the race becomes a focal point in the nation. Punching babies and dogs helped it to become that too though. As many of you know I am a pretty big Will Ferrell fan, I love his style of humor and really just enjoy watching his work. This is the first movie I've seen of his where I felt like he was almost trying too hard. He was still funny, but he was falling back a lot on his "W" and "Talladega Nights" character and to me that was a little distracting in some parts. That is the only downside I had to this movie though. Galifianakis was hilarious and the voice he used made me laugh at almost everything he was saying. The supporting cast was also perfect and this is very close to being a great comedy. The only thing keeping it from crossing into greatness to me is that the characters did seem a little overused from other movies, but if that's the worst thing about the movie that should say something. Overall, a very funny Ferrell comedy but not one I would buy and watch over and over like "Anchorman" I give it a B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Campaign" did have its moments, but it never really managed to stand out from the many other comedies on the market. Which was a shame, because there were some great actors on the list and people were doing great jobs with their roles.As much as I don't keep an eye on politics in any aspects, then I found "The Campaign" to have some great moments of laughs and it was obviously well released up to an upcoming American election.Will Ferrell (playing Cam Brady) and Zach Galifianakis (playing Marty Huggins) were great together on the screen, because of their personalities and charisma. I will say that it was Will Ferrell who delivered the most laughs, where as Zach Galifianakis came off as a more lovable character. But the movie also had other impressive actors to its list; Jason Sudeikis (playing Mitch), Dylan McDermott (playing Tim Wattley), John Lithgow (playing Glenn Motch), Dan Aykroyd (playing Wade Motch) and Brian Cox (playing Raymond Huggins).The jokes in "The Campaign" were great and fun, and the situational comedy was great as well, as usual from Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis.Unfortunately the movie as an overall was just mediocre, and I doubt that I will watch it a second time around. To me, it just didn't have that kind of potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Ferrell ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be 100% honest, before watching this movie I expected very little from it, I've never got the hype about Will Ferrell, I find him annoying, arrogant and stupid ! but nevertheless I still wanted to see this movie, one because of Zach Galifianakis and two because I was hoping that it would be good even though i was certain it wouldn't be.In truth the movie is OK and watchable, but nothing more. Will Ferrell is considered a "comedy actor" so you would expect it to be funny, however, during the whole movie there is only a couple of times where you will find yourself laughing, these moments coming from Zach Galifianakis who in my opinion holds the whole film together and makes it watchable, he is hilarious as the weird, feminine and slightly pitiful character Huggins ! his voice is superb in this movie and his body movements equally excellent. Dylan McDermott is also brilliant as "Tim", the character responsible for the extreme change in Huggins through out the film, Tim's job is to make Huggins a candidate that Americans will vote for, and McDermott plays this part wonderfully. Will Ferrell's performance was again annoying, extremely predictable, and for me the guy lacks talent and i really really don't understand how people rate him as an actor! He isn't even remotely funny. Apart from McDermott and Galifianakis performance, I didn't think the movie was great, but as I said before, it is watchable.I did like the plot, although it was predictable (I wouldn't expect much else with Ferrell in the film) it did have a meaning and a couple of messages, it showed money really counts in politics, that big companies can buy people, that people always want their parents approval, and that just because someone appears as a weird or odd person, doesn't mean that they aren't a good person seeking whats right or that we have any right to judge them or poke fun at them, as more than often, they're the ones who will stand up for what they believe in and have good morals.I was going to give this movie 7 out of 10 for the performance of Zach Galifianakis alone, however, it lacked really funny moments and Will Ferrell was awful. I'll finish on this, If you are a Will Ferrell fan, you'll love this movie as its exactly like most movies he has been doing the past how many years, but if like me, you're not a fan of Ferrell and aren't sure whether to watch it or not, Id say go to see something else, you're not missing much, but if its an extremely boring day and you just want to see something, it is watchable and you'll enjoy McDermott's And Zach Galifianakis's performance :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A better than average and funny take on the American political system and the way America "thinks"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Ferrell is the incumbent Democratic senator who has been on shaky ground due to a wrong phone call. Galifinakis is the "weird" local guy who has been propped up by two businessmen(Dan Aykroyd completely wasted) in order to protect their business interests. The movie follows the two rivals through their eight week campaign. Some of the dialogues are outrageously funny and will definitely tickle you. The situations are well thought out and are a good satire on the way Americans "think" and vote. The acting is fairly good with Zach completely stealing the show. Ferrell gets to mouth the obscene dialogues and has the higher share of laughs. However, it seems a tad long and could have been edited to close to 75 minutes( I saw the 95 minute long extended version and not the theatrical version). 3 out of 5 for the Campaign. Watch it for Galifianakis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The politic system we know with a touch of humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This year over the summer of 2012 a new kind of comedy came out having to be about two individuals running for Congressman in the same town of Hammond, a little pleasant town. The "Campaign", audiences will be able to engage in a step by step from beginning to end to see what kind of battles go on between these two rivals to see who is standing at the end. Both men running for congress soon find themselves battling themselves rather than each other losing friends, family, and the point of being a congressman. In which the underdog in this movie comes out on top with a twist that leads him to victory.The character Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) is in his fifth term running for congressman that he has not ever been opposed, until he makes a mistake by calling the wrong number to a family that he leaves a very inappropriate sexual message causing bad media. The four times winning Congressman fails to grab the voter's attention with only thinking about himself completely disregarding all his promises that he has made to the towns people that puts him in a deep hole. Soon the big time corporation businessmen Glenn (John Lithgow) and Wade Motch (Dan Aykard) that are funding Cam Brady's campaign want a new face that they can control with their own decisions in mind. Will Ferrell's role was a man that had all the power at first that knew what he was doing whether it was right or wrong, that at the end used his power to do what was right when reminded.We soon find a character known is this movie as the underdog named Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis) who is targeted by big time businessmen the Motch brothers. The brothers get his father that is involved with the politic system on board to get Marty to run against Brady. Marty Huggins finds himself doing as his father told him convinced to make his family proud and make improvements to his hometown he's grown to love. Being the only person to run against character Cam Brady, Marty is in a whole new ball game to stay in competition gaining votes. Zach Galifianakis character was a little more complex he played the odd underdog that nobody took serious in the beginning. He seems to lose himself, but becomes a better man when he finds himself gaining the trust of his town at the end we all become to love.Disguised as a comedy the themes influence is large corporations having enough money power that can control the election in some cases that is relevant today. The angles in the movie were great shots where they had full lighting to be able to see all the character's expectations and reactions to what situations were going on. The plot of the movie was great over all adding a sense of humor to the topic of politics was a good movie for director Jay Roach to use. Coming out with the movie in August before the November elections grabbed my attention of what really can or goes on behind the scenes of politics. With political figures running against each other battling it out to look good in the media and public eye that turn on each other to look better than one another.References: From Wikipedia the Campaign http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Campaign_(film) The IMDb movie reviews on the Campaign by the Massie Twins http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1790886/reviews</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I done wanna live in no rainbowland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie succeeded in parodying those things that are so amusing about American politics: the hair, the overdressing, the accents, the religiosity, the hickism, the slickery, the focus on the media and the polls, personality rather than issues, the demagoguery, the strange mix of prurient and puritan, the obsession with sex and religion, the backroom politicking and media advice, the baying mobs, and the baby kissing. Let's not forget the dumbing down of every issue to simple platitudes ("I done wanna live in no rainbowland!"), simplistic issues and demonising. Yes, I know it was portrayed unrealistically in the movie. But there is something about American politics that makes it the deserving target of this kind of parody.The writers were able to steer away from the more contentious issues. The safe themes were "honesty", "cleaning out Washington", "the rich are destroying America" and "don't sell out to China". Safe, because both sides claim these positions. The movie was meant to reflect the current American presidential campaign and apparently the nature of politicking in North Caroline. Does the release of a movie like this indicate that Americans are tired of their political culture? They certainly don't seem to respect it. From a "Civics 101" perspective, this is a disturbingly cynical movie. The elected reps from North Carolina are probably aghast.I enjoyed the parody, but I found the film to be no more than mildly funny, despite the comedy heavyweights. I can't pretend to know what went wrong here. The writing, I suppose. The proceedings felt staged, sophomoric, camp, over the top, rather witless. Maybe that was the point; in which case I just wasn't into it. (I nodded off for about 20 minutes in the middle.) I'm probably in the wrong demographic.I don't mind coarse language, but there was way too much of it. I had the same problem with "Ted". American society is not this coarse, so why do they portray it this way in the movie? For our amusement? Coarse language is not funny in its own right, is it? It was an adult movie, right? Sometimes American comedic filmmakers give the impression that they use coarse language simply because they can get away with it. With great power comes great responsibility.Was there a problem with the comedic acting? I am not particularly a fan of Will Ferrell's comedy (not that I haven't tried). I thought he was OK. Zach Galifianakis, who does make me laugh, was quite good, but he was playing an unusually subdued role for him. There were some superb comedians in this movie, but they never really strutted their stuff.Dylan McDermott played his role well enough; however, he just didn't belong in this movie. To me, he doesn't come across as slick. (But god this actor gives hope to the rest of us that it's possible to remain insanely attractive as you get older. He must be well into his 50s by now, and yet look at him.)Final word: nice parody, mildly funny</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expectations were set to high</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, The Campaign was very well composed, it combined both hilarity and a level of seriousness that was appropriate but not unusually serious for the cast. It started out with a good mix of humor and ended in a way that you weren't distracted from the plot or the conflict. Some might argue that a movie took a downward spiral humor wise and than made it a bad second half. I disagree with this, i would argue that it merely toned down the calamity and outlandishness that are expected of both Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis in order to more expertly present the conflict resolution. The problem is that nobody expects the roles that they play to be serious in the slightest. This is exactly like how it was hard to take Jack Black seriously in King Kong. All three actors have backed themselves into a corner in this way and have to be careful about the roles that they take on if they want to remain as popular as they are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Words of a congressman: commend our father, disregard the opposition and do not invite any babies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two of contemporary cinemas most gifted and fashionable comedy men, Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis team up in The Campaign as rival competitors as they scuffle amongst themselves to become North Carolina's congressman. Cam Brady (Ferrell) has been uncontested as the long-term legislative body but is valiantly challenged for his seizure of supremacy by a fragile and tender church loving, Chinese dog owner by the name of Marty Huggins (Galifianakis).Considering the current deterrent state of political affairs and principles around the globe, The Campaign is ingeniously written and performed with absurd, illogical representations and is flawlessly timed with the American election soon to raise its curtain. The film's format of embroidering two completely alternating personalities is magical. Brady is a leopard skinned kitten, wonderfully blow-dried who is loyal to the flag and a dedicated republican but his principalities lay on a different accord, disobeying any faithfulness to his wife, dimly displaying any love for religion and has a tendency of lamping small children and harmless in-house pets. Huggins is a devoted North Carolinian, a loving father, overly reasonable and severely inadequate in contrast to his bitter adversary. Following an industrious ordeal to dispatch Brady's of his supremacy by the indoctrination of 'secret political agent' Tim Wattley (Dylan McDermott), we experience the back-and-forth notions of heated debates and immeasurable confrontational bust-ups. Huggins begins to stand up to Brady's superstar persona to prove his worth, whilst discovering a few concealed truths, an unfaithful refrigerator grabbing wife and a comical antics of his two 'sensible' and 'harmless' sons.For those who feel strongly about their politics and legitimacy's may find this outing a genuine taboo. The film's objectification to take government rulings seriously may offend those devotees but on a lighter level, parallel to this we are invited to a rather amusing encounter. For those familiar with Ferrell's and Galifianikis' frolics throughout their comedy careers, will certainly benefit from countless hoots and giggles, and with further sequels ready to appear in the near future, teaming both Ferrell and Galifianikis together minimally supplies us with a niche to remind us of their more superior projects due for release over the next year. The Campaign could be illustrated as a timid enterprise to enlighten the mood and remind us that aside from Hollywood's beastly adventurous sincerity recently, that it is still blessed with a few laughable bodies willing to put on a show. Ultimately, Jay Raoch has attempted to shatter the illusion of politicians manufacturing a structural reliable democratic society by highlighting the countless flaws of patriotism and the imperfect nature those who summon the rules of our livelihood. Therefore, The Campaign is very undemanding on its audience, guaranteeing them with laughter at both the hilarity of the lead protagonists and of the lack of gravity imported on the narrative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferrell's The Campaign only middle of the pack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ferrell's The Campaign only middle of the pack Audiences loved it when Will Farrell teamed up with Steve Carrel and Paul Rudd to deliver the news in 2004's Anchorman. They were in hysterics seeing him and John C. Riley wear Chewbacca masks in 2008's Step Brothers. Now he's at it again- this time making a mockery of politics with Zac Galifianakis in The Campaign.Although his career has been filled with careless neglect and empty promises, Cam Brady (Ferrell) has been the longtime congressional representative of North Carolina's 14th district. His boozing and womanizing has gone largely unnoticed and he appears to be headed for another unopposed election win. But when his ratings drastically drop after an obscene phone call corporate bigwigs Glen (John Lithgrow) and Wade Motch (Dan Aykroyd) see an opportunity to replace him with their own political pawn, the na?ve and very odd trolley tour guide Marty Huggins (Galifianakis).What ensues is outrageous smear campaigns and dirty slander that tarnishes the reputations of both men. But as the debate becomes increasingly barbaric, both candidates begin to wonder if winning the election at all costs is really worth the turmoil.Will Farrell is at the top of his game and proves yet again why he is the best in the business. No other man could punch a baby and still get people to laugh. He's loud, obnoxious, and totally over the top but his supporting cast does not follow suit.Zac Galifianakis lacks the out-of- leftfield jokes and childish demeanor that made The Hangover an undeniable classic. This is more the character from 2010's Due Date with Robert Downey Jr. Although Galifianakis is still funny, he tries to be overly eccentric and comes off more odd than hysterical. Dan Aykroyd and Jason Suduskis (yeah he's in this too but barely) are underutilized and very forgettable.While The Campaign presents a funny look at the shady world of politics (this film is for you John Edwards) it is not wildly hysterical like audiences expect. It is definitely the best comedy at AMC right now but will be remembered more for what it could have been rather than one of 2012's funniest.Overall grade- B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Political Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is pretty funny and has several joke that had the whole theater laughing. The ending was weak and predictable and unfortunately, like in most comedies, all the best jokes were ruined by the trailers. That being said, Will Ferrell &amp; Zach Galifianakis did a good job in this film. The characters they played, although fairly standard characters for the two of them, contrasted in all the right ways. Will Ferrell played Cam Brady, a over-the-top, sex-starved incumbent who is expecting to win unopposed. Zach Galifianakis plays a mousy foppish nice-guy business owner named Marty Huggins who is only running because the Motch brothers (a thinly veiled version of the Koch bothers played by John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd) do not think Cam Brady is electable and they need someone they can trust to pull off their nefarious plans. The plot is political satire on the state of dirty politics today with lots of funny backstabbing along the way. Add in a generous helping of why too much hidden money is bad for politics and you have this movie in a nutshell.The Panel votes: Cthulhu: 2 out of 10 (Cthulhu doesn't like exposing dirty politics and there was not enough blood to satisfy his thirst.)Fuzzy Toad: 3 out of 10 (Fuzzy Toad says sex scenes and language are too much for little ones even though there is no nudity but there are scenes that even young kids would laugh at.)Mouth-breather: 5 out of 10 (I don't know why they picked Dan Aykroyd. In my opinion someone like Jack Nicholson would have been a better Motch brother.)Frat-boy Bob: 7 out of 10 (LMAO but there were not enough boobs)The Queen in Yellow: 6 out of 10 (This movie was very funny IMO. I enjoyed the caricature of Hillary Clinton as Cam Brady's wife Rose played by Katherine LaNasa and the very funny role played by Sarah Baker as Mitzi Huggins)Azathoth: 97 out of 3 (Indecipherable madness)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Goofy does not equal satire. Yes, there's no doubt that the Motch brothers in this movie are supposed to represent the Koch brothers, and yes, Cam Brady's "strong" hair is supposed to remind us of John Edwards, and so forth. You'd have to be pretty stupid not to see these and other correspondences. But it's the things these characters do in the movie that make the film anything but satirical.Satire makes us laugh but in the process also reveals a point of view that may not otherwise be evident. Cowboy Slim Pickens in "Dr. Strangelove," sitting astride a thermonuclear bomb and shouting yahoo as it falls toward a target city, is funny but painfully so, and it suggests something about possible underlying attitudes toward war that make us flinch. That's satire. Will Ferrell punching a baby in the face, then a dog, is not. Nor is his having sex with a gal in a porta-potty while his campaign crowd watches the thing rock back and forth.Basically this is a movie where you can almost see the writers casting about for what outrageous thing the characters should do next. We know too well that big money has corrupted our politics, that the media can be manipulated with sensational distractions, and so forth. This movie adds nothing to what we already know too well.Having said all this, I have to admit that when the kid confesses to letting a goat lick his penis I laughed pretty hard.</fullReview>

The movie is a look at the dirty tricks that opposing candidates Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis use against each other. Among the best scenes are those where the candidates blatantly pander to different groups. There's also some low, crude humor to keep things going.The movie is also an indictment of corruption. Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow play a pair of industrialists obviously modeled on the Koch brothers. In the end, the movie is just a really funny look at the absurdity that is the US political process: sex scandals, kissing/punching babies, and "looking like an al-Qaeda member". Basically, the movie doesn't have to make anything up. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not easy to craft a competent political satire?one that manages to be funny, truthful, and eye-opening all at the same time. This is the task of The Campaign, the newly released motion picture that sees Will Ferrell and Zach Galifiankis at each other's throat in a bid to win the hearts of a small Congressional district in North Carolina.The set up is there, and the potential for biting comedy was ripe for the taking. But there's a problem: The Campaign resigned itself to idiocy. It decided that it would be best to allow Ferrell and his ensemble to roll around in the mud of gross-out gags and the usual crude humor that finds his audience both cringing and chuckling?the sort of thing that's appropriate for the likes of Step Brothers. With The Campaign, the sense that greatness is waiting just beyond every turn is a palpable one; the perception that grossly simplified political barbs might give way to genuine satire?and ultimately genuine insight?is tangible. But this never happens. Instead, we're handed a movie that becomes increasingly dumber?and thus increasingly less significant?with each passing frame.If it feels like I'm raking The Campaign over the coals unfairly, I apologize. There are some really funny moments in the movie (my favorite involves the pre-debate trash talking that we always imagine takes place between candidates during the obligatory handshake), and there are plenty of instances where Ferrell and Galifianakis do what they do best (specifically, make us laugh til we snort). The rest of the time, though, we're left wondering what happened to the expertly crafted dialogue that sees Republican and Democrat clawing at one another in a futile effort to justify his perspective to the rest of the world. When we're watching babies get punched in the face?yes, you read that correctly?instead of witnessing two comedic titans thoroughly skewer the clowns we know and love (or hate) in Washington, the understanding that director Jay Roach and screenwriters Chris Henchy and Shawn Harwell have settled for something only mildly entertaining is absolute.And by the time the standard narrative tie-ups have played out and the predictably optimistic conclusion has revealed itself, we're left with one burning question: "What, exactly, was the point?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the funniest feature films I've seen in a long time. It is what I would call a genuine comedy film, in which the majority of the first 75% of the film will have you literally laughing out loud. The plot was captivating, and acting was fairly decent, and the ending was kinda cheesy but decent nevertheless, although I would find certain R-rated scenes involving midget women quite disturbing... The movie manages to make a political satire without the distinguishing of the liberal/conservative/democrat/republican factor in its jokes, which many political satires specifically exploit with political stereotypes. It mainly focuses on politics itself and hence the "America, Jesus, Freedom", which is an emotional exploit commonly used by both sides of the argument. Of course the southern accent was just typical of its setting (I would suspect), but there is just something welcoming about the heavy southern thing that cowboys do to the English language that adds to the comedy. In terms of drama, you do laugh a lot, but you do not get emotional enough at points where the directors would have wanted you to (such as the scenes where certain characters break down), therefore the emotional points should not be taken too seriously. In the satire department, it offers nothing fancy in comparison to what other films already have, despite the better emphasis on the "degenerate public" thing where polls go higher if candidates do something controversial. Being Chinese, I did find the "Chinese dog" and the whole "China corporation take over America" thing a bit offensive, but I guess it's still in good health if I can squeeze off a laugh at the remark. Verdict: Overall, this is a very hilarious comedic film, not very dramatic, has a lot of gags and puns, has satire but nothing fancy, and the heavily inbred southern accent is a welcome change from the typical "normal English" in most films. See it, laugh it, love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like nothing we haven't seen already, Will Ferrell plays a character that depends on comedy through the chemistry of his new on screen buddy Zach Galifianakis.North Carolina is iconic for the origin and current congressman, Cam Brady (Farrell), who, despite rivalry through-out his career, the chances of Cam retaining position every year is pretty fat. While taking the personality of a modern day body of government, Farrell's character is a mocking portrayal of George Bush which he uses to air a lame comedic performance.To lighten the mood is Marty Huggins (Galifianakis), a some what camp individual who is happy out walking his Chinese pugs and running his low budget tourism centre.When two CEO's eye future profits, a devious plan is set on reforming the campaign by convincing Marty that he could out-way Cam's votes and become the next Congressman. As Naive as Marty is, he is easily convinced as he sets on proving his worth to his not-so proud father Brian Cox.It is no ordinary campaign this time around for Cam as he is shocked to find Marty stepping up to the plate. Insulted by Marty's actions, a war of words turn into a war of media as Cam realises that Marty is not acting on his own. Mitch (Jason Sudeikis) is assigned to accompany Mardy and to make sure he uses every trick in the book to out-wit Cam and win the pride of Carolina.A simple slap-stick that offers nothing new in terms of originality and overall humor. Will Ferrell was anonymous as he remained on the outskirts while Zack Galifianakis tried savouring a dying film from start to finish. Ferrell's performances are quite boring this time around, offering a concept we have seen time and time again; Blades of Glory, Anchorman, Step Brothers, all rivalry concepts that were quite successful upon release. The Campaign had outweighed this concept, with unworthy results.Zack Galifianakis is quite humorous as a quirky socialite with his presence adding a comedic ingredient to every scene. Although the chemistry between both looked well on screen, it didn't play well as each scene they were tied up in was childishly played or just down right boring, with gags such as the baby punch desperate to win you over. You will find yourself laughing more at the stupidities of the film while you realise you are left abandoned from the iconic, witty dialog that Ferrell and co once brought.The Campaign comes with a complete lack of comedy freshness, with a partnership that was destined to happen since The Hangover. Sadly the performances didn't play to the hype. Zack Galifianakis will continue to move forward. I have doubts over Will Ferrell's next destination. Recent times have fed me that result.Overall; so mundane, offering the same old stuff! Although a cheap part-time gag is on the table, the performances and overall film results in 85 minutes worth forgetting!

		<shortDescription>Two Funny Guys In One Unfunny Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cam Brady has never lost a race a candidate seat because he's never had to run against someone. That changes when two CEO's plan on scheme that involves aloof Marty Huggins to run opposite Cam. The biggest problem The Campaign has is that the written material does not match the on screen talent. Arguably two of the funniest film comedians working today in one film that lampoons politics in a very timely release year should equal great comedy gold. The two funny men play well against each other and some of the supporting characters do well from time to time, but the film doesn't have any stand out funny moments. I think I chuckled once or twice at stuff that seemed like improve more than what was in the script. Will Ferrell is in full on jerk mode here, there is nothing he won't do to win this race. Ferrell has been in the game for a long time and Zach Galifianakis, while having been around for awhile has only gotten to be in the spotlight in recent years due to the success of The Hangover. So at times it seems like Ferrell "teaching" Galifianakis, the "new guy" and the two of them battling it out to be funnier. That was more entertaining than the film itself. Dylan McDermott has a small role as a campaign manager and he does great in the role. He's got an attitude and he tries to shape of Marty Higgins to look the part, looking the part involves getting "american" dogs, having a Bible and a giant picture of an eagle above a fireplace. This film has small moments of funny bits, but those are few and far between. Maybe if I saw this with an audience, it would have been funnier. Most comedies do better when you see it with a crowd.The Campaign is something that would be worth a rental if your a fan of either of the two leads, nothing more. Both John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd, two legends in comedy, get zero laughs. SNL cast member Jason Sudeikis who is usually good is rather bland here. I feel like I wanted to like this film more than I ultimately did. You definitely do not *need* to go out and see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a very memorable 'Campaign'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Republican getting positive treatment in a modern Hollywood film? This IS a trip to Fantasy Land, or "Rainbow Land" to quote from "The Campaign," the newest comedy starring Will Ferrell, who, along with Zach Galifianakis ("The Hangover," "The Hangover Part II"), attempt to parody the current political season with less than successful results.Actually though, both the GOP and the Democratic Party take their lumps in this Jay Roach-directed story of a corrupt, idiotic, womanizing incumbent congressman, Cam Brady (Ferrell) who represents a small North Carolina district. Running unopposed (despite several embarrassing foibles ? one of which includes a sexually-explicit wrong number phone call to a straight-laced religious family), the Democrat gleefully ignores his sagging poll numbers and the panic that news brings to his increasingly nervous staff.Seeing Brady's vulnerability, corporate moguls the Motch brothers (Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow) draft the son of a colleague, Marty Huggins (Galifianakis), a meek, lisping man-child tour guide with few social skills and no political experience, to challenge Brady. He flounders in an unknown world of slick, personal attack ads and is way over his head ? that is until the shadowy Tim Wattley (Dylan McDermott, "Nobody Walks") becomes his campaign manager.With Brady making an unbelievable series of gaffs (losing debates with amazingly stupid comments, punching a dog and a baby, getting shot, being arrested for drunk driving and running anti-women campaign commercials), Huggins surges into the lead. Not one to rest on his laurels, however, Wattley accomplishes a new low when he secretly films Brady's son, Cam, Jr. (Randall D. Cunningham) confessing to Huggins that his father is never there for him and then calling Marty, "dad."Incensed beyond his ability to remain rational, the elder Cal delves even lower to seduce Huggin's wife, Mitzi (Sarah Baker, "Bones" and "Modern Family" TV series), as the ridiculous campaign spins out of control with more bizarre behavior that results in both candidates surging to unrealistic leads just days before the election. And then for good measure, a monkey wrench is then thrown into the proceedings when the evil Motch brothers unveil their plans to "insource" several local factories by actually bringing in groups of cheap Chinese laborers to replace American workers.Real commentators, such as Chris Matthews, Joe Scarborough, Dennis Miller, Bill Maher, Ed Schultz and Wolf Blitzer, among others, add to the reality (or surreality) of "The Campaign," although, few of the scenes in which both men lose their families, friends and self-respect in the nasty little political race ring very true.And while Ferrell and Galifianakis (with accents that range from an SNL George Bush-lite to the gay community college instructor on "Family Guy") do have some decent chemistry as the battling opponents who will stop at nothing to win - and there are some genuinely hilarious moments (a short film by Team Brady introducing Huggins to the press is very funny) - the movie eventually becomes too dark, mean-spirited and ugly. And as such, unable to sustain the early laughs to come to any satisfying comedic conclusion.Like an overlong "Saturday Night Live" sketch that could not seem to end on a particularly funny note, "The Campaign" suffers from the same identity crisis which affected another so-called political comedy, "Evan Almighty" (2007), which substituted real fun for a rather preachy, heavy-handed message. Belting little children and dogs also seems a bit far-fetched and violent, as well, but I will take the guffaws that come from these scenes over some of the tepid sequences which plague the latter part of this effort.That, and another (completely unnecessary) Will Ferrell psychotic meltdown, far too many "F" bombs and scenes that just go on with little or no point, relegate this movie to the "could have been much better" category. Not a total electoral defeat, but not a victory, either, "The Campaign" will garner a few more giggles than groans, but with tighter direction and a crisper script, it could have really meant something more ? especially in the middle of a very important election cycle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Campaign is not memorable, more like bearable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be the first time Will Ferrel has run for office but that's the only original idea in this latest comedy as 'The Campaign' uses borrowed material from his previous films through out the 90 minute runtime. It takes place in the present year where Cam Brady (Ferrell) looks to be taking his fifth term in office as he faces no opposition. That is until underdog Marty Huggins (Galifianakis) chooses to run. Will Ferrell's latest entry starts well enough with some humorous dialogue but it wares thin and becomes repetitive and feels less like a political comedy and just a average comedies with cheap laughs. The greatest performance comes from Dylan McDermott who plays Marty Huggins's campaign manager who provides some of the best laughs with his less them calm approach to the election. Director, Jay Roach has a great track record with previous success such as Austin Powers and Meet the Parents but misses out on a great opportunity this time round to The Campaign both clever and relevant especially with the current issues in the political world.How long will it be before even the most avid Will Ferrell grows tired of him playing the same character with only a different name to separate them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Campaign" Is Incredibly Disappointing. One of the Worst Films I Have Ever Seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Campaign" is truly atrocious. If you watch this film, you will be disappointed. It sounds like it would be hard to go wrong with a cast that includes Will Ferrell, Zach Galifinakis, Jason Sudeikis, John Lithgow, and Dylan McDermott and a director like Jay Roach who has experience with both silly comedy ("Austin Powers in Goldmember") and mature political dramas ("Game Change" and Recount"). It went wrong. This film was torture to sit through. My expectations were high for "The Campaign" and were immediately lowered. I wanted a sharp political satire and received a low-brow farce made with absolutely no intelligence. The plot is almost nonexistent. Two candidates compete for votes and constantly try to destroy each other. The film mean-spirited, nasty, stupid, and 100% laugh-free. The brilliant Jack McBrayer is utterly wasted in a raunchy scene that makes you realize that you've wasted your money. Will Ferrell once again plays an exponentially exaggerated frat boy and Zach Galifinakis is nothing more than a crass homophobic stereotype. The one and only good performance is Dylan McDermott as a ruthless campaign strategist named Tim Whatley (the name of a dentist on Seinfeld) The ending totally reverses what the rest of the film has established, not that it gets better. the film starts out as a raunchy and tasteless farce and ends on a trite and sentimental note. "The Campaign" is a truly horrendous film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Ferrell and Zack Galifianakis make the uneven The Campaign quite enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this political comedy with my movie theatre-working friend this afternoon. Will Ferrell is the incumbent congressman running unopposed again...until Zack Galifianakis enters the race at the last minute. There's plenty of hilarious raunchy humor during much of the beginning scenes but then goes real soft near the end. So that makes The Campaign quite an uneven experience though because of the likability of the two leads, one does feel a little good having watched it. And I did get some added pleasure of seeing three generations of "SNL" stars represented here: besides Ferrell, there was also Jason Sudeikis as his campaign manager and Dan Aykroyd as one of the Motch brothers (the other being John Lithgow). Also was floored whenever Karen Maruyama was playing Galifianakis' family maid who speaks like a stereotypical mammy in front of the patriarch (Brian Cox). So on that note, The Campaign is worth a look. P.S. If I hadn't read about it in my local paper, I wouldn't have known that this movie was shot in New Orleans and surrounding areas in my home state of Louisiana or that actress Katherine LaNasa, who was Ferrell's wife here, was born there and grew up in Baton Rouge where I live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Campaign promises political satire with punch, as amoral sleaze Will Ferrell delivers politicians' platitudes and scandal with rib-tickling aplomb, before the movie descends into clichéd schmalz and a juvenile ending. Despite some tiresome ad-libbing that falls flat, Ferrell steals the show and the best gags, while Zach Galifianakis as the mincing Christian half-wit must rue the day he took this role. This movie does have good laugh-out-loud moments, but the filmmakers don't seem to understand their audience. One the one hand, there's lots of profanity and sexual humour, but the ridiculous good-guys-versus-bad-guys plot could only appeal to 10 year olds. The moral hand-wringing and heartfelt speechifying so beloved of bad Hollywood movies builds up to a truly pukeful conclusion that doesn't even bother to pay lip service to credibility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Political Satirizing Need Not Involve Baby Punching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four years ago, in the months leading to the election of Barack Obama, the film "Swing Vote" was released, a political satire in which the outcome of a presidential race depended on the vote of just one man, played by Kevin Costner. There was a funny, intelligent, observant film; it wasn't about who Costner's character would ultimately vote for so much as what the candidates were willing to do in order to win him over. It's now 2012, it's an election year, and yet again, a political satire has been theatrically released in the months before anyone can set foot in a voting booth. It's called "The Campaign," and it stars Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis. This time around, the results are less than optimal. As is the case with so many other raunchy comedies, this movie is strained, unfunny, and often times in incredibly poor taste.Anything relating to politics is an easy target for parody, and I'll be the first to admit that certain aspects of running for office are too dirty and backhanded to not be portrayed in a humorous light. But as with any lampoon, getting it right depends entirely on who gets their hands on it. The people behind "The Campaign" have some very wrong ideas about how to elicit laughter from the audience. If you need a specific example, look no further than the scene where Ferrell accidentally punches a baby; to expect anyone to find this funny is to have completely lost touch with reality. In a follow-up to this scene, Ferrell accidentally punches Uggie, the dog from "The Artist." It's bad enough the filmmakers are making light of child abuse. Why make things worse by adding on animal cruelty?The foundation of the plot involves two corrupt CEOs, brothers Wade and Glen Motch (Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow), who have illegal dealings with the Chinese and want to staff factories in North Carolina with cheap labor imported directly from China. In order to gain influence in their state's congressional district, they must first dethrone Democratic congressman Cam Brady (Ferrell), who's running for his fifth consecutive term. This is only because he went unopposed during the first four races. The Motch Brothers set their sights on a local tour guide named Marty Huggins (Galifianakis), a dimwitted and effeminate family man who sounds an awful lot like Mr. Garrison from "South Park." With the help of a ruthless campaign manager named Tim Wattely (Dylan McDermott), who dresses in black and looks like a hit-man, they groom Huggins into becoming a congressional candidate for the Republican Party.Because Brady is such a dirty fighter, Huggins must learn to be just as unfair in his attacks. And so begins the grandstanding and mudslinging, exaggerated to such a degree on both sides that it eventually stops being entertaining and becomes tiresome and repetitive. Part of the problem is that the filmmakers take amusing ideas and overplay them. There are so many instances where jokes are stretched beyond the point at which they can still be considered funny. After a while, they all come off as desperate and afflicted with a lack of originality. There is, for example, a scene early on where Huggins pressures his wife and children to admit to any indiscretions before the campaign can get underway; the list of things they confess is not only long, it's also only halfway funny to begin with and gets steadily less funny with every passing line. Mostly, it's just gratuitous and disgusting.If there is something good to say about this film, it would be the way in which director Jay Roach and screenwriters Chris Henchy and Shawn Harwell depict candidates answering debate questions. They successfully overstate a politician's tendency to dance around an issue without actually providing a definitive response; in the film, Brady observes that he doesn't understand the rhetoric, but he knows all about pacifying voters by mentioning Jesus and freedom. This is a good start. If only someone had thought to not focus so much on crude sight gags and even cruder lines of dialogue. It's not so much what the filmmakers are saying, but how they're saying it. It doesn't take long for the clever observances to devolve into a monotonous stream of four-letter words.Other subplots work their way into the story. Huggins vies for the support of his disapproving father (Brian Cox), while Brady faces rejection from his highly superficial wife (Katherine LaNasa), who knows he has been sleeping with a twentysomething cheerleader. Meanwhile, the mudslinging continues; Huggins is compared to an Islamic terrorist, Brady's second-grade illustrated story is labeled as a communist manifesto, and both end up crossing personal boundaries by interfering with members of each other's families. Is any of this funny? Not especially. It's downright deplorable when it resorts to lamebrained ideas like baby punching. "The Campaign" may please die-hard fans of Ferrell and Galifianakis, but I can assure you that their praise will have less to do with satirized politics and more to do with watching these men act like clowns.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)</fullReview>

As long as there was a way to tie in cheap jokes and "funny" farting.The movie starts off without the attempts at comedy, thankfully, and it's just Zach Galafanakis sassing it up with some boyfriends. I love him but this is not one of his better works. It's fine for a while, thanks to his comedic genius, but then the whole stupid spiel about political mudslinging comes in and like a genie in a bottle, it lets him enact a whole bunch of well, really stupid fantasy sequences (as evidenced by the poster).

		<shortDescription>An Amazingly Solid Political Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Campaign marches its way into the midterm election season with tremendous laughter, sweetness and enough Will Ferrel zaniness to hold audiences over for the triumphant return of Ron Burgundy in 2013. Here, Will Ferrel and crew manage to make a political comedy that actually has a sense of humor. Meaning, it pulls punches at both parties, rather than it being a liberal love fest. When I first heard of this movie, I expected it to be more of the same. Jay Roach is notorious for making left leaning political bio-dramas like "Recount" and "Game Changer". Will Ferrel is known to be an outspoken liberal democrat. Zach Galifinakis is one too, remember the Mel Gibson debacle on Hangover Part II? But these three Hollywood big shots step over the party line and make a fun movie that satires the very thing that we as Americans should all laugh at, the campaign system. We all know the phoniness of campaign ads and political mudslinging. The Campaign puts these issues right in its place. Now the movie itself is hilarious. Its the Adam McKay/Will Ferrel formula at its finest. From the minute the film opens till the very last minute, you will be falling out of your seats with laughter. I haven't had more fun at the movies this year than with The Campaign.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dark art of politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is election year in the United States where the President, the whole of the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate stand for election. American politics is notorious for being very bitter and negative: so it seems like a fair target for a comedy.Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) is a four term Democratic representative of the 14th district of North Carolina, based around the city of Hampton. He is running unopposed for the seat but he is in trouble after he accidentally leaves a sexually explicit message on a born-again Christian family's answering machine. His backers, the industrialists the Motch brothers (John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd) decides that Cam is a dud and set out to find a someone to run against him. They find the nice, but na?ve and weird Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis) to run as a Republican. The campaign quickly descends into false accusations, personal attacks and physical violence. But the Motch brothers have their own dastardly plan for Hampton.The Campaign is a hit and miss comedy, but it is mostly hit. Ferrell is the best comic performer out of the pair but both comic leads have their moments. The jokes vary from verbal, crude and swearing based, Ferrell's trademarked adlibbing and physical: the biggest laugh in the audience I was in was when the baby got punched in the face. As a political satire this is a film that lacks subtly, but to anyone who is interested in American politics you can easily see the references to negative campaigning, making false accusations that someone is a communist/socialist or an Islamic terrorist just through implication, how candidates just use any rhetoric to get elected without actually having any ideas or policies and how political campaign teams think more about image then they do about doing what they think is best for the district and the country. I personally thought the film missed a trick because I think the filmmakers should not have mentioned the political parties the candidates represented and so you could not tell them apart.The Campaign runs at a brisk 85 minutes, but near the end the film felt like it running out of steam, both story and jokes wise, near the end. The writing was not smart enough when it could have been more ambitious with its satire.It is still an enjoyable enough film for people who are fans of Will Ferrell and it is at least worth a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have just walked out...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a wasted opportunity. Will Farrell has brought forth some great humor in movies with an added message of truth. However, this time the mark was missed. 'Politics as usual,' was a great start for a box office hit, especially in an election year, and this held all the ideas to make it happen. It could have been gut-busting hilarious, but the execution of film making was drastically short for the plot's potential and casted talent. While there were some very good laughs, the rampant smut quickly wicked a lot of laughter from the theater. The pull to 'look away' distracted and overcame the anticipation for the next chuckle. Comedies should make us laugh, and perhaps think about the topics and subjects being mocked. It is even a useful venue for starting discussions on otherwise untouchable issues like politics, religion, sex, and divorce. The presentation of irony, sarcasm and good writing for a memorable classic were all but entirely replaced with empty, humiliating smut. The actors and makers took an easy out for a quick buck instead of delivering what movie-goers expect and deserve. If we pay them, they should deliver. Now I can't get my money or time back and I have encouraged the junk effort to continue. It's like celebrity welfare. When we buy a ticket or product for an advertisement we view on TV, we should get what we were shown. The Compaign left viewers obviously disappointed and thirsting for the comedies we can recommend to anyone and everyone, as well as to stock the home DVD rack.</fullReview>

If it didn't have that format, there would not be much of a story, but just a bunch of gags.Some of the gags are OK. Sadly, most of the OK ones are "out there" (like punching little life forms) - meaning, they're not really OK, but work in the context.Performance-wise, most actors do OK, but not really well or inspired.Comedies like these can have a message, like painting all modern political campaigns as worthless or such. But, it doesn't, because you know it's a comedy, so you don't care for all the idiotic things that happen, 'cause there's no emotional impact to feel. Of course, it's perfectly fine to just use the premise for laughs, but, in that case, the laughs should be much better or more frequent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite the comedy expected from Ferrell and Galifianakis.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With two well proportioned comedian/actors, there should be plenty of laugh out loud jokes in The Campaign. Ferrell and Galifianakis are running for congress of a small town in North Carolina. Ferrell is outrageous and nonsensical whilst Galifianakis is a bit of a dork. They never quite gel in their battle of wits. Scenes that separate them are stronger than those united. The story doesn't progress past each candidate attempts to outdo the other, until the inevitable conclusion of a winner. At least The Campaign is a lighthearted film, even if the comedy's below average. Ferrell and Galifianakis have the potential to do so much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if any of the main actors have helped with the dialogs or the characters, but they fit very well into their parts and the dialogs and everything.Well if you take a real life story (maybe) and turn it into a comedy with Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis everything can go wrong (in a good way), it does not in this case, but the do make a lot of fun on the expense of politicians and politics. This is funny for most parts, it is raunchy, a bit foolish and sometimes over the top, but most political campaigns are, it seems like this is a comedy that are making fun of something that in the first place is funny and maybe a bit stupid.They make it work, capture the moments and the points and is entertaining most of the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zach and Will are good, but movie is a bit of a dud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Campaign is an uneven slapstick comedy about two polar-opposite candidates in a North Carolina district. Zach Galifianakis and Will Ferrell star as Cam Brady and Marty Huggins, respectively, one vying for an uncontested fifth term and the other a tourism director. Jay Roach, who directed the Austin Powers movies, is at the helm here.Cam Brady is a slick ladies' man, but when he accidentally leaves a (shall we say) ribald message on the answering machine of a devout family, his backers the Motch brothers think it's time some new blood was sent to Washington (on their behalf). Enter Marty Huggins, who displays none of the alpha-male characteristics one might expect from a politico, as his dad Raymond (Brian Cox) is an old hand at politics and a friend of the Motch brothers. Marty enters the race mainly to impress his jaded dad, who's always favored his other son Clay over Marty.Marty's quickly in over his head, but help arrives in the name of Tim Wattley (Dylan McDermott), who's sent by the Motches to be Marty's campaign manager. Wattley soon has rearranged Marty's life (new dogs, new furniture, new wall hangings, new haircut for his wife) and has instilled confidence and even some ferocity into Marty's normally placid personality. This helps Marty in the first candidates' debate.The Motch boys (Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow) are patterned directly after the Koch brothers, real-life political cronies, with the same business-first mentality. The brothers' aim is to place someone in Congress who they can get favors from, such as tax breaks and other incentives for their various factories.This is not a shrinking-violet movie. Whole lot of profanity, a lot of it funny and some of it even in good taste. The story may seem a little mean spirited to some - the trailer famously showed Ferrell's character punching a baby, sort of a no-no in politics - and truthfully there are times when the nastiness is a little over the top. Galifianakis and Ferrell are good enough to pull it off, but they can't work miracles. That said, there are some really funny scenes, including the debates, the fake commercials (which escalate in hostility), and really any interaction between the stars.But the movie is also often too maudlin and melodramatic; too much that could have been funny or at least sweetly sincere is instead blown up, stretching our credulity even further. One thing about this movie certainly does ring true, and that is that Big Money can win a campaign.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-Scripted, Underachieving Satire That's Less Than the Sum of its Parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another tick in the long line of silly, themed Will Ferrell vehicles, this doesn't quite reach the heights of Anchorman, Talladega Nights or Old School, but fits comfortably on the second tier alongside Step Brothers and Blades of Glory. It's a steady rotation of softballs for Ferrell and co-star Zach Galifianakis, who tackle a political atmosphere ripe for satire with all the nuance of a six-foot dildo draped in the American flag. For what it's worth, most of the gags seem more heavily scripted than I'd expect from these two, so the few scenes that do allow some room for improvisation are, as expected, the best in the film. The comedians' giant personalities mesh nicely as the picture rolls on, but their relationship doesn't revolve around the kind of relentless give-and-take typified by the similar dual leads in Step Brothers. Ferrell's all-in as the scumbag lifetime politician, sleazy in ways that haven't even been defined in the English language, but Galifianakis is actually worth rooting for as his soft-spoken upstart challenger. Of course, it wouldn't have legs if he didn't get his hands dirty at some point, and his gentle nature makes it all the more rewarding when he finally gives in to his baser instincts and fires back in kind. Funny and thin, but you probably already knew that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Campaign</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Silly political shenanigans/satire and a plethora of oh-so-wrong jokes (I mean, Congressman Will Ferrell actually punches a baby, and the visual of it is played in slow motion!!!) populate this comic vehicle for the pairing of Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis (who are really comic gold during their best moments (which are when the film pokes fun at everything political campaign)).Zach is a North Carolina small town nobody with a big heart and naiveté that is at times quite endearing even if it is at his expense (he can be easily manipulated, at times, but when his integrity is ultimately challenged he does the right thing) sometimes who gets dragged into a political campaign against a lecherous congressman Farrell, notorious for his womanizing and support of big corporations financing his last eight years as a politician (only bailing on him because he seems so spoiled by numerous sex scandals).The Motch Brothers (Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow, expertly cast in small but important parts considering how their characters have such influence in the political realm, planning to turn Zach's home town (and surrounding real estate) into an economic playground for big business, with an idea of "insourcing" Chinese laborers to their numerous factories, paying them $0.50 an hour, while the American natives are unemployed!) decide to fund Zach's campaign (he doesn't know about their plans), and hire Dermot Mulroney as his manager. Mulroney's influence in Zach's life undermines his family idyll and begins to change him in ways that affects his marriage, morals, and social presentation. An angle on political campaigns is nothing new (the excellent Michael Ritchie drama with Robert Redford, The Candidate, and the funny/smart powerhouse, Primary Colors, with Travolta, are both fine examples of these), but The Campaign decides to hit us with a lot of trashy humor, such as Farrell's infidelities and low-below-the-belt actions to defame, belittle, and attack Zach's character and family life (like when he records a sexual encounter with Zach's neglected wife!!!). Zach's use of a Rainbow fantasy colored book by Ferrell, from when he was a kid, to claim as a "communist manifesto" during a town hall meeting is a bit much and explains how Mulroney's influence on the opposing candidate has become morally dubious, to say the least.With religion even entering the picture (Ferrell attends a church who handles snakes, getting bit and becoming temporarily maniacal, until he destroys the house of a deeply religious family, taken to the hospital with a seriously swollen arm that appears on the verge of bursting), and plenty of lively jabs at how politicians can become morally compromised and jaded while supported by special interest groups and are supplied by the comforts that can come with political office (the mansion, swimming pool, money, and hookers).It takes a long way to get there, but Ferrell finds his humanity by film's end, as election night seems to indicate he'll remain in office thanks to the Motch brothers rigging the polls and siding with the current congressman due to Zach's unwillingness to sell out his home to corporate greed. Zach accusations of the Motch brothers on Capitol Hill in front of fellow congressional members with Ferrell by his side is kind of a bit bizarre and "yeah, really." Ferrell's wife's monetarily soulless nature (she's all about the perks that political office brings) is played up as is Zach's square Americana. Even when Zach pays for one last public announcement commercial, admitting his wrongdoings and past mistakes, it leads to people telling their significant others (or person next to them) some rather jaw-dropping revelations ("I'm your twin sister." "I'm using our children's treehouse as a meth lab". A couple both admit to having an affair with a waitress, etc.), produced for laughs. Be warned; when Ferrell purposely uses a sex video as a way to get revenge on Zach (after Zach is able to get Ferrell's son to call him daddy!!!) as a campaign advertisement (!), you kind of know the movie you're in for. Brian Cox has a small part as the father of Zach (he can't really stand him; basically, he just doesn't understand him), grimacing at the very sight of him, who has a moment of fleeting pride in his son (when it appears he is on the verge of winning the nomination, and the Motchs' support, that is). With Jason Sudeikis as long-suffering manager for Ferrell, enduring much scandal until the sex footage with Zach's wife pushes his sensibilities too far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zach and Will playing Zach and Will</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some untold reason, Hollywood is usually indifferent when it comes to treading the ever widening gap between Republicans and Democrats. Political satires, as we have seen before (Welcome to Mooseport), works in favor of an international audience by not dwelling into either philosophy too deeply. That being said, The Campaign does throw subtle jabs towards Conservatives as well as Liberals, and in doing so, makes this movie a slapstick lampoon rather than a witty satire. Why? Look no further than characters played by Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis ? one has a heart of gold and the other thinks he excretes gold! Running for his fifth consecutive year as Congressman of North Carolina, Cam Brady's (Ferrell) campaign hits a snag after Cam publicly embarrasses himself in a sex scandal. Seizing the moment, albeit with corrupt intentions as puppeteers, industrialists Wade (Dan Aykroyd) and Glenn Motch (John Lithgow) ring up Marty Huggins (Galifianakis) as Cam's rival contender. A naive and timid family man, Marty is no contest and Cam has no trouble in drawing first blood at the introductory campaign launch. This is when the Motch brothers send in campaign manager Tim Wattley (Dylan McDermott) to Marty's rescue. Tim is quick to turn Marty around into giving Cam a run for his money. The rest, if you stay tuned, is a tooth and nail dogfight but typical of a Will Ferrell movie; think Step Brothers and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.Of the two 'wolf pack' comedies last year, The Campaign might just have the edge over Neighborhood Watch, thanks to Adam McKay's hand in producing and co-scripting the story. Judging from McKay's previous collaborations with Ferrell, comic elements here are a standard affair and as expected, you get to see a grown man behave like a little brat, or in context, a sore loser. As such, Ferrell's Cam resorts to some dirty tricks that translates into crude humor, both above and below the belt. In contrast, Galifianakis's Marty is a watered-down dimwit, but an oddball nevertheless, with honest intentions behind his political aspirations. Pitched on a collision course, Ferrell and Galifianakis are both within character and both within their elements as comedians. The problem I see is that familiarity comes with contempt, part and parcel. Amid the outrageous slander and sledging, tantrum throwing and punches that don't land on target, Ferrell and Galifianakis will make you laugh, some, the same way they have done before. Just don't expect to be rolling down the aisles. As a comedy, the story gets by with regular chuckles where the few original jokes are sporadic yet engaging. But considering the comic talent and various cameos throughout the film, there is hardly any input from the supporting cast. Jason Sudeikis as Cam's campaign manager is mostly sidelined. On the other hand, McDermott's default shadiness in Tim seems to work without any apparent attempt at humor. Then there is Lithgow and Aykroyd whose wit never really manifests into a comic moment. Finally, the feel-good ending undermines all the comic mischief that went into the premise ? morons who decide to become leaders.For all that it's worth, this is probably the first political romp aimed at actually making a stance during the 2012 election season in the United States. With multiple spoofs within spoofs, it's no wonder that Motch rhymes with Koch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very funny film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a young American, I perhaps assume that while politics have always been a dirty business, there was a time when someone like Sarah Palin would have never been viewed with any credibility. How could someone so clueless and compromised pull the wool over people's eyes and pretend to be anything less than a moral sellout? This movie seems less like farce than a cautionary tale about money in politics and the way in which a political candidate can be bought by large corporate interests. The Motch brothers in the film are clearly a reference to the Koch brothers who are perhaps the most ruthless opponents of the democratic process. Its all about the money, Lebowski. So is the movie itself any good? I laughed very loudly at certain parts though I feel there were some scenes that were unnecessarily vulgar and just plain mean spirited. I'm not a moralist, but crudeness is becoming the norm in comedies occasionally in the place of true wit and inspiration. Whether this movie will cause the average viewer to look into nefarious dealings of the Koch bros and others and possibly find out what Citizens United means to our democracy remains to be seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard of the concept of the movie, I thought this was going to be all out. Like completely over the top, not holding back on anything, not trying to ground itself too much in reality. But truth of the matter is, that while still exaggerated, you could most of those things happening (some of them surely have happened too). So while it wasn't as wild as I had hoped for, I still was satisfied with the movie.But does that mean, that everyone will like it? Of course not. It's tough to tell with a regular drama, but with a comedy there is no accounting what will hit with the audience. Same goes with politics. Sometimes people don't want to hear the truth or blinded by the love for the party they favor they can't see what is right in front of them. Some of those issues are lightly touched in this movie and of course there is a moral tale in there too. But that doesn't take too much away from the comedy (imho).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good But I Was Expecting More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Campaign (2012) *** (out of 4)A man (Will Ferrell) is about to run for Congress unchallenged yet once again but at the last second a family man (Zach Galifianakis) gets on the ticket and soon dirty politics are at play. THE CAMPAIGN is an entertaining movie but at the same time I will admit that it wasn't nearly as funny as I was hoping. The film really does seem to have been thrown together quickly to try and cash-in on the real political stuff that was going on in 2012. I say this because the majority of the jokes are rather simple and obvious where I think a smarter story could have came up with much more satire aimed at the political parties from both sides. I mean, is it any shock that a candidate is having affairs with young, sexy women? Is it really any shock that a candidate would talk dirty when the cameras are off? A lot of the spoofs here just seem to be stuff that little kids would come up with as they were trying to act bad and talk dirty. With that said, there's still some pretty funny stuff here including Ferrell punching a small baby and a later scene where he punches a now famous dog. There's also no question that Ferrell appears to be having a blast and his foul-mouthed politician is a great role for him and he manages to do very good with it. Galifianakis is also good in his part even though he's pretty much playing the same style we've seen from him before. The two actors have some nice chemistry together. I thought Jason Sudeikis, Dylan McDermott, Dan Aykroid and John Lithgow were all wasted but it's still nice seeing them. THE CAMPAIGN certainly isn't a classic and it's not even one of the best comedies of the year but it's mindless entertainment if that's what you're looking for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In serious times such as now, maybe something less intense might be the winning ticket. With the current Presidential campaign winding down, I think the entire country is ready for something a little less serious and a little less important. With that said, along comes the cornball comedy "The Campaign" staring the irrelevant off beat actor Will Ferrell. When you go to see Will Ferrell in a movie, you know exactly what to expect, silly crazy acting, absurd and ridiculous storyline, off color humor, and of course several good laughs along the way. I didn't expect much from this movie, but in the end it was entertaining and did provide some humor, a lot of silly, and even a little amusement. Just know before hand what you'll be getting, don't set your sights too high, accept the absurd and then try to enjoy the campaign ride. With this campaign your vote doesn't count and thank God for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CAMPAIGN is certainly by far the most restrained performance of Zach Galifianakis. A viewer cannot be blamed for having expectations high as this critic did especially following up to unforgettable performances in HANGOVER &amp; DUE DATE. The question at hand is as follows. Is Zach restrained due to the character he is written to play or is he restrained because of the interpretation of the character by director Jay Roach? The critic cannot answer this accurately however is able to share an opinion. Jay Roach is known for making decent comedies. AUSTIN POWERS, MEET THE PARENTS, MEET THE FOCKERS &amp; more recently with DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS are a widely popular few. Jay worked with Zach in both DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS and THE CAMPAIGN and in both occasion he built the character in the same framework in terms of personality. Whilst it did work in favor of the movie in DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS it does not fly well in this critic's opinion with THE CAMPAIGN. Hence in this critics perception the talent of the actor is obvious and the restrains set on him by Jay Roach is vivid.On the other end of the line Will Ferrell is unstoppable. The blow dried congressman from North Carolina is the lion's share of laughter. Child punching, Dog Punching and controversial voice messages are a few of the rib cracking moments if not the only moments of the 85 minutes production.Exposing the darker side of politics on a lighter note, the timing of THE CAMPAIGN is impeccable with certain elections around the corner. There is a subtle hint on the corruption behind the arena of politics that Jay Roach very obviously unwittingly ponders upon. The similarity of the Motch Brothers with a certain (The name rhymes with Scotch) politically influential family in the US is obvious. However without pushing the obvious further Jay Roach carefully treads the path preserving the comedy instead of back lashing the brothers.There is indeed a bitter sweet lesson in THE CAMPAIGN if critically analyzed in terms of a message to society and the motive of the screenplay. Then there is also the belief that certain shades of grey is best left not disturbed when it comes to a political angle. That role is better left in the hands of a journalist of the discipline and not in the hands of a movie critic.Averagely done but strongly felt as a wasted opportunity.TITLE: THE CAMPAIGN DIRECTED BY: JAY ROACH STARRING: WILL FERREL &amp; ZACK GALIFIANAKIS RATED: R RATING: 05/10 85 MINUTES</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The rated R comedy is the worst thing to blight the cinema. For every one that's legitimately funny, there are twenty million pieces of #$%@. Lowest-common-denominator teenage stoner flicks that think anything gross and raunchy is h-i-l-a-r-i-o-u-s!I wandered into watching The Campaign. When it was done, and I let the film settle in, I was furious at its freaking stupidity. You will struggle to find a greater manchild in film than Will Ferrell's Cam Brady. Rude, selfish, stubborn, impulsive - an idiot to the core. Throughout his campaign, he never appears to be an actual human being. I'd call him a stereotypical politician, but the satire is too dumb, the character too retarded. Zach Galifianakis' Marty Huggins is just as awful. He's funny because he's fat and awkward. LOL! The film kept piling the crap. Ferrell has sex in a porta-potty, he shows pictures of his penis, he punches a baby in the face (with embarrassing CGI). He gets bitten by a rattlesnake, goes crazy, and - you're gonna love this! - even has a boner! Ahahahahaha! There's barely any setup, context, or consequence. These "edgy" moments could have been replaced by anything, and still elicit chuckles from the inebriated crowd.And then the film tries to be culturally relevant by bringing up corruption in politics. That's the funniest joke of the movie. Seriously, you're gonna have kids talk about their sexual misdeeds, then criticize the Koch brothers? Shut the !@#$ up. You've accomplished absolutely nothing.I think being with a friend who loves the movie helped contain my anger. But wow, it was an unpleasant waste of time. I now understand the hate for Will Ferrell. A failure in satire and comedy, watch anything else. Its not worth one or two actual laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because The Campaign is designed to be consumed and the wrapper (your ticket) tossed on the floor, there's very little I can say about it (a source of joy to my critics).I saw The Campaign in the summer of 2012. The benefit of writing a review almost two years later is that one can look back at what--if anything--was important in the film.Almost nothing.I laughed at Will Ferrell's buffoonery and Zach Galifanakis' fly-over-country innocence, but that was all. As with so many comedies that don't have the depth or breadth to sustain them after being seen, the funniest parts of the movie were hyped in the advertisements. Yet, seeing a matinée with my wife--and leaving the kid and critters at home for a few hours--was very pleasant.If you rent The Campaign, just be forewarned that you will be expected to pick up your wrapper instead of leaving it on the couch.</fullReview>

The sad part is there are lots of laughs in this movie when it allows itself to deviate from it's agenda and focus on two men running for the same office. Will ferell is halarioua as always, and can save just about any script from failure. That much said this movie displays Hollywood/wallstreet biggotry towards fly-over country at it's worst. If Hollywood lampooned jews, blacks, women or latinos, the way they have rural white anglo saxon protestants, there would be riots, law suites and worse. It get's a little gratuitous and begins to look desperate. The writers knew what they where doing, because the scenes that are funny are really funny, but as I've already stated, the agenda of belittling rural conservatism at every possible opportunity, spoils the otherwise light hearted fun movie. The closing scene is vitriolic, unfunny and is the explanation point in a film, made because Hollywood remains irate that tea party conservatism constinues to gain momentum in the U.S House of Representatives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is pure waste of money. Please do not watch it and spend your $$$ somewhere else. Empty, shallow humor, may amuse some people but generally this is even worse than Jim Carrey (hard to imagine). The script? What script? Someone wrote it as his atonement, I presume. I tried to find some pluses in this movie. The only one and funny was the fat kid. How can someone let small kiddo be pastured to such an extent, dude is almost exploding with this fat, come on, is this normal?!?. And what is Dan Aykroyd doing in that movie, uh? Even Zach Galifianakis is NOT funny, I feel pity for this guy. Dunno, I want to forget about this . My rate is 4/10, only for few jokes out there. Nothing more. Cheers</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Ferrell and Zach Galifinakis both have a reputation for making their audience laugh and fall off their seats in result. Before seeing this movie I was expecting twice the comedy, and was shocked when exiting the cinema. The Campaign had potential to be a real funny comedy, but did not live up to expectations. The acting was less than satisfactory, the plot was stunted in some places and the jokes were nothing but dirty toilet humour. However, I will say that the casting was very well done, getting backups from Jason Sudekis, Dan Akyroyd and many more. Overall, this deserves a less than satisfactory rating, but i'm giving it a 4..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can't remember an almost non stop laugh out loud movie for a long time. It is more sophisticated than the SNL satirical parodies and more consistently hilarious than a Farrelly Brothers movie. You might have expected a comedy about a political campaign to be obvious and preachy but this comedy succeeds in clever spontaneous jokes that are not too crude.One of the best roles for Will Ferrell so far. In the past I think he was best in supporting roles eg Producers, Wedding Crashers than in leading roles. But this role suits him to a T. He manages to bring a combination of John Edwards, GW Bush and other political caricitures into a perfect blend. Zach has a role that is also suited to him. His effeminate conservative character is hilarious. Good supporting cast. Who knew Dylan Mcdermott could do comedy.Good job Chris Henchy on a great screenplay. Found it better than the Hangover 1 or 2 or Bridesmaids which were cruder and had long painful stretches. Loved the negative campaigns - should be required watching for campaign staffers. Some really hilarious bits are the Lord's Prayer and the maid. The only fault is the conclusion seemed a bit rushed in an effort to tie things up.Better than the trailers suggest. Funniest of the year by far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They were willing to do anything for a laugh in this movie and for the most part they found the requisite humor. Nothing subtle hereA mysterious political image-maker (Dylan McDermott) is dispatched by the diabolical billionaire Motch brothers (Dan Ackroyd and John Lithgow) to groom well-meaning but naive small-town eccentric Marty Huggis (Zach Galifianakis) as the Republican candidate in a North Carolina congressional race against Democrat incumbent Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) a jackass who wins re-election every time just by going unchallenged. Armed with a new image, talking points and a file of Brady's political baggage the challenger becomes more and more appealing and has the illusion of political momentum projected onto him by those looking for someone new as an alternative to the vapid, self-destructive, sex-addict/drunk, slogan-spouting moron in office.The two very flawed candidates proceed to leak damaging information on each other practicing the politics of personal destruction and counter-intuitively the politics of self-destruction concurrently. They are paradoxically rewarded by appealing to the lowest common-denominator, stage-managing their campaigns and pretending to be things they are plainly not.Recent events in the 2012 election year show us that what this film portrays isn't that far off. Missouri Congressman Todd Akins' comments, those of Republican candidate Frank Szabo, outrageous attack ads against Florida Congressman Allen West - the hyperbole is out of control and it fires voting bases of very stupid, very angry people who think they are casting votes against satanic communist heathens by the time they reach the polling station.While the humor here is scathing, venomous and extremely funny its success lies in its being seen by the kinds of audiences who really know enough about the electoral system to understand what is going on but not so much where they might see impracticalities. It should be a sad commentary but it makes for biting satire.Cam tries to attack Marty pointing out that he has a mustache like Saddam Hussein and the Taliban and actually gains traction. Marty answers back that Jesus had a mustache which of course suddenly makes it alright. Marty shows people Cam's grade two class-project - Rainbowland, the story of a teddy bear who gives gold to a leprechaun and calls it "The Communist Manifesto" because it has wealth redistribution as a theme the way wackos have gone over the top about things like Obamacare and its so-called "death panels".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a fan of the movies the amazing comic Will Farrell has been in, then you will LOVE "The Campaign". This movie was funny right from the start. The actor Zach was very funny as well and played his character perfectly. I loved it when Will Farrell started right off the bat to establish himself as a scumbag. Not only does he have sex inside a bathroom porta potty, but he makes phone call to this innocent person and says stuff that i can't say in this review. Let's just say that I was laughing so hard that I almost laughed up my BBQ that I had prior to the show! I loved it when he looked over at his opponent during a debate and said "Welcome to the F'n show". This was classic! Sure, the movie won't win any kind of Oscar and the fact that Will Farrel's character didn't go to prison for stealing a cop car is a tad unrealistic, but let's face it! In this time of terrible political candidates (Like Obama), this is a nice relief to escape the misery of seeing our current politicians on TV all the time. There are so many funny scenes in this movie! I give it TWO VOTING BOOTHS UP!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I like Will Ferrell, he doesn't ever really do middle ground. In this movie he manages to play the same random blurb outrageous character we know all too well. It's time he start thinking about a new comedy routine, because once you've seen one of his movies you have seen them all. The Campaign is no exception. The real star of this movie was Zach Galifianakis. It's amazing that he is able to provide solid comedy without even having to use a single swear word.While The Campaign has good intentions, the writing focuses more on poorly executed jokes than serious politics. While this is good for a crowd that doesn't care about politics, for those who take interest it is a big let-down. There isn't any real deep political humor, nor is there any kind of attempt at a serious point. The only noticeable thing it takes a jab at is how we outsource labor to China and how we let money run politics. Other than that there is little to be desired.It did offer some great laughs, but it's easily forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could use a Recount</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Jay Roach seems to be the perfect guy to direct a political campaign parody during a Presidential election year. He has had plenty of low-brow comedy success with Austin Powers and Meet the Fockers. He gained respect with his political sharpness in Recount and Game Change, and he is co-founder of Funny or Die. Instead, the movie has the feel of being thrown together during a long weekend with his drinking buddies. Lucky for him, his buddies include Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis.Revolving around a North Carolina Republican Congressional primary, we are first introduced to a smug Cam Brady (Ferrell), the four term incumbent who expects to run unopposed. Not long after we learn local twit Marty Huggins (Galifianakis) is entering the race ... even though he freezes in front of the camera and has no apparent platform or special issue to support. Of course, that is the one thing both candidates share - the issues aren't the focus of the movie or their campaign. Rather, this is meant to poke fun at what political campaigning has devolved into, and how we as voters continue to fall for the dirty game of politics.We soon learn that the billionaire Motch brothers are financing Marty's campaign. Their single interest is making more money and they need an indebted politician to help them buy up cheap district land and re-sell it to the Chinese so that cheap labor can be "insourced". Clearly the Motch brothers (John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd) are meant to spoof the real life political power brokers, the Koch Brothers.Clueless Marty gets help from intense campaign manager guru Tim Whattley (Dylan McDermott) who there to make him not suck so much. First thing is to re-do Marty's image ... they remodel his house, right down to replacing the family pugs with two more popular breeds. As Marty gets caught up in the campaign fervor, we get the expected results: he drifts from his family, the dirty stuff includes real life political sojourns like drunk driving, sexting, infidelity, false accusations, religious hypocrisy and public embarrassment of the opponents.The real statement here, if there is one, seems to be that we the voters have allowed political campaigning to turn into a contest of who connects with us and who seems to be like us, rather than a focus on issues present and future. Kissing our baby or attending our county fair shows the candidate is one of us, while in fact, gives no indication of whether the candidate has any true beliefs or understands the issues. There are plenty of laughs in the movie, though it's not my particular favorite type of comedy (think Talladega Nights). I will particularly tip my cap to Zach G for his willingness to do whatever is necessary for a laugh. He is a fearless comedian.</fullReview>

One thing I don't like is his gay twin brother bit, which is the character in this.Will Ferrell gets an A for effort and energy but, like many of his other films, that is juxtaposed against poor material to work with. Or he's just in it just for the buck.But the script and directing were especially poor. The gags and jokes were old, tired and on-the-nose. I'm an ultra-liberal and tree-hugger but thought the preachy tone was embarrassing. No subtlety, no finesse. Even if it chose to be crude, the timing was ham-fisted and clunky.But the overriding crime was IT WASN'T FUNNY. Crude is fine. Ted was crude and funny. The Hangover movies were crude but funny. This was crude and amusing at best.The over-the-top quality of the gags were unrealistic, even if you factor in satire. Neither of these characters would have survived in an election vs. what they did and the ads they broadcast.Miss it, even if you're a big fan of both men. Miss the DVD.

		<fullReview>As a Will Ferrell fan, It pains me to give this movie such a low rating, but here I go. Ferrell and Zach Galifanakis play rivals in an election for Congressman. The plot is connect-the-dots predictable: a nice guy starts out nice, realizes that playing dirty is the only way to go in politics, then both have a change of heart and wind up wiser all around. Because of the "R" rating, I expected things to be crude, but was hoping that there would be at least some sharp satire about the political process, too. After all, how hard can it be to poke fun at politicians? "The Dictator," had its share of tasteless gags, but also managed to make a few shrewd points about the US and its political climate. The movie's script feels like a first or second draft. It could have used a lot of tightening to make a truly hilarious movie. Right now with the upcoming Presidential election and all the nonsense that's about to commence, it would have been welcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Diverse Comedy, Same Old Ferrell and Zach G.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If action isn't your cup of tea, then chances are you chose the comedy film that came out this weekend entitled The Campaign. In case you haven't heard about this film, it's essentially two unlikely candidates Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) and Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis) running for the North Carolina Delicate position. With the ballads cast, the two Carolinians decide to go at each other's throats until only one man is left standing. Who will be the winner? Is there any other plot to this already pathetic plot? Should you care to see it in theaters? Read on to find out.So if you think the plot sounds familiar, you'd be right as this is essentially what every election is about in this modern age. Warner Bros. decided to make fun of current day political campaigns by adding the two, for lack of a better word, eccentric actors to poke, prod, and utterly slap politicians in the face. Ferrell in particular seemed to have been chosen for mirroring the corrupt, egotistical, self-involved side of the politicians, as he had his eyes on one thing winning. To no surprise, he did a nice job playing the jackass once more, capturing every detail to the letter as if it were his natural self. Fans of the former SNL star's overacting will once again be laughing their heads in every scene with Ferrell as he talks like Ricky Bobby, gives his wide eye stare like Elf, and makes some pretty perverted jokes that cross the lines. I'll admit now I didn't find him that funny, but that's because his material has grown stale on me for some time now and I just don't care for him. Regardless, Ferrell will keep his devoted fans pleased with his na?ve stupid character and his irrational, though sometimes funny, political strikes. Instead the candidate I found to be more humorous was Galifianakis. The Hangover star still has a natural tendency to make people laugh and this film is no different. His character mimics the eager politician who goes in for the right reasons, but succumbs to the "outside" factors that supposedly have no influence on politics. Regardless Zach's ability to play awkward characters really shines in this movie, as Mr. Huggins is indeed awkward. The innocence of Marty is childlike and seeing him approach more adult situations put him in some interesting situations that were rather funny to watch. His reactions to his campaign manager's constant demands involve many goofy faces, random catch phrases, and some well delivered cursing that had me in stitches. What might be even more satisfying is the rivalry between Ferrell and Galifianakis has a lot of dreamed up antics come true. I won't reveal who gets the better of whom, but if you have distaste for any one of these actors, well you'll see them take a few hits now and then. Even Marty's family opens up some ground for laughs, but it's really only one scene that kind of does a rapid introduction to Marty. However there is a shock factor to this movie that I did not see coming. I'll warn you now that a lot of scenes were edited in the trailer that was not as audience friendly in the theater. Many simple insults and teenager terminology was replaced with more vulgar comments, some of which were not needed. A few of the acts of violence were also more extreme in the actual movie and while they were funny at times, there were times where this kind of humor overstepped some boundaries. There were even some intense romance scenes were also a little awkward to see as well, especially a rather dirty message to an unsuspecting family, which is funny on the situation, but not on the words. Those with high boundaries though, will probably be unfazed on a lot of these things though, especially if you like movies like "The Change Up and Horrible Bosses. What else can I say about The Campaign? Well surprisingly for a comedy, there were some good messages built into the movie. Although the team was mainly humiliating many politicians, they also managed to open a lot of people's eyes to the deals made in the background. Seeing this corruption fuel the race may make one a little angry, but do not worry because in a comedy there are lots of good things that come from introducing this corruption. The production team also did a nice job on portraying the two character's families and how they can be a hindrance or a blessing depending on the character's morals. Again there are more laughs to be had, but it's nice to see a comedy where the characters have some other character trait than extreme horniness. Who knows, maybe the politicians who come and see this film will actually see the light and do something with their jobs. Morals aside though, this comedy did a decent job integrating some media tools to help increase their joke variety. I may have laughed more at some of the media jargon and lingo than I did at either character, but that's just me.Despite my initial doubts and judgments, the Campaign wasn't that bad. While Ferrell didn't impress me, Galifianakis managed to get me laughing a lot. Throw in the insults to the American politicians, the exaggerated stunts, intense rivalry, and characters with morals and you get a decent comedy. Is it comedy of the year like people are saying? Not really, and I think this movie is best saved for a rainy day and Netflix. Again be warned that some of the scenes have been severely altered from the trailer, so if you are planning on taking your younger kids take that into consideration. My scores for this movie are the following Comedy: 7.0-7.5 Movie Overall: 6.0-6.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think my summary says it all. I had high hopes for this movie, but after watching it this weekend, I am deeply disappointed. There was so much potential - Ferrell and Galifianakis are hilarious and work well together, plus both men are politically active in real life. How could this NOT work? Perhaps it was the directing. Some of the reactions feel over-long, which is difficult to avoid when you're making a comedy. Not everyone does it as flawlessly and perfectly as the editors of "Wedding Crashers," but then again, this movie almost makes it annoyingly over-long when a character delivers a joke and the rest of the characters react/respond. It takes your gag from funny to weird.Some moments are funny... but they are already in the trailer or are quickly forgotten. Jay Roach needs to step away from directing comedy. He's clearly unable to figure it out.</fullReview>

The message...politics is run by people that have a lot of money. Pardon me, producers of this film, but this is not news. Most of us know that. This message was broadcast over and over during this film and took away much of the enjoyment.

		<fullReview>I honestly love comedy, even starting to appreciate the less subtle blend, but The Campaign? Sorry that just didn't work. I mean it did have a great idea with a relevant theme that a lot of people would identify with, but here's the problem, The Campaign? Never lives up to it.The plot (where the bulk of the problems lie) was, by far, the worst thing about the movie. The plot can be summed up through the following words: broken, confusing, irrelevant, uninformed, and poorly written. There were several questions raised in the movie that were never answered or even dealt with for that matter. Like, there was this theme of "Recession" which apparently had something to do with the characters, but it was never explained where (or what) these characters were to begin with.The comedy consistently misses the mark by a huge margin. This movie was intended to be a comedy although it's shockingly unfunny despite an almost foolproof set of comic circumstances and what passes these days for actors. It tries to be funny and thoughtful and ends up being incredibly and offensively stupid and trite.If there are any redeeming qualities it is the performance of Dan Aykroyd who put a lot of effort into their character. By all means it was lovely to see the "Ghostbuster" man again but sadly he doesn't have much to work with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Both Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis have proved numerous times that they are comedy gold with the right project. Both of them have also been a part of some clunkers even if they were still able to make it work. Their latest film brings these two comedy giants together for The Campaign. Will Ferrell proved himself in this kind of role with his numerous turns as George Bush, but can Galifianakis bring a new character to the table to knock this one out of the park or will the polls close early? The Campaign follows a long-term congressman who makes a high profile mistake prior to an upcoming election. Looking to get more influence in office, two wealthy business owners see this as their opportunity to get someone in office they can control. Enter the director of a local tourism center who is clearly the most unlikely choice, but with the help of a cut throat campaign manager gives him a run for his money like no other. The trailers for this film looked amusing, but really never delivered anything more than average. Hopefully this will not deter people from checking this movie out because it is way funnier than the trailer lets on. This is easiest one of the funniest movies to come along this year and probably the best of these two guys in quite a while. They pull no punches with this over the top political comedy that not only delivers on the laughs but takes jabs at the current state of politics. It could be reading too much into it, gut if you look closely you can see them taking this time to really poke fun at almost every aspect of government office and their scandals. The only real issue with this movie is the ending as it kind of takes an about face from the rest of the movie. While it doesn't ruing any of the comedy gold that the movie delivers throughout, it just seemed like it took an unlikely direction from where it was heading.This movie is funny as hell and delivers that one two punch that is missing in most comedies today. It's been too long since we got a good political comedy and this one not only fills that void it takes it above and beyond. If you're a fan of either of them or raunchy funny over the top comedy then get to the poles quick and check this movie out.http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey</fullReview>

For me ferrell is just doing a good impression of Bush JR in this movie haha and spot on he is too. Showing how dumb the voters are is genius and how corrupt the system is, The actors must of been willing to do this movie for free! I doubt many Americans would even see this but oh so obvious to us UK viewers.

		<shortDescription>Its A Mess! Funny But Forgettable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Campaign", starring Will Farrell and Zach I'm not going to attempt to spell that long and difficult Greek surname, was released at the appropriate year of 2012, just two months shy of a real political race between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. However, these two men are not running for president (though it would've been much funnier if they were) but are instead running for congressman in North Carolina's 14th district. Any film that is trying to satire American politics has to be funny, right? The race is between Democratic Cam Brady (Farrell) who is running for re-election against Republican Marty Huggins (G). Now, usually a politician's political party (donkey or elephant) is an important topic when selecting who to vote for. Most people vote based on their political party. Here, its non-existent, which disappointed me. All the Democrat and Republican jokes they could have intelligently nailed. They could've shed light on the pros and cons of the two political parties and help people see that they should vote for the PERSON, not the party. Okay, I'm getting a little too deep now. This is a COMEDY after all, not a anti-political party documentary.Pros of "The Campaign": *The acting: The acting is actually pretty good. Now, I'm NOT a Will Farrell fan. He's far from a favorite of mine but I actually enjoyed him here. Zack G. plays his usually goofy character but thats what he is good at. The supporting cast with Dan Aykroyd, John Lithgow, Dylan McDermott, Jason Sudeikis (I think I spelled that right) and Sarah Baker is also believable and add a lot of humor.*The humor: The humor is good for the most part. Forgettable? Yes. Still good? Yes. Its great that humor is finally being shot at politics without it being on Saturday Night Live or Youtube. Without me ruining the film you, the jokes are good. Like most comedies, some jokes work, some don't. Overall, there are many laughs.Cons of "The Campaign": *The humor: Yes, this is a pro AND a con. While the humor is mostly good, there is a lot of eye-rolling moments that hurt the film. Some humor that isn't funny is present obviously. Some humor that the writers are TRYING to make funny that really isn't funny is also present. Humor that is shoved down your throat, trying to be funny, is present as well.*The story: the story was really weak. If the story had JUST been on two random men running for office, using every little political cliché in the book as a joke, with maybe a good message for voters such as "...Politicians are people too" or "...vote on the person, not just the party", it could have been amazing. But no, they add in the greedy businessmen who want to "buy" the 14th district. Now, I'm not saying that doesn't happen in American politics. It very much DOES. I just wish that wasn't the focus. It just made the movie more complicated then it needed to be. It made the movie...well...a mess.In conclusion, while "the Campaign" isn't the best comedy of all time, it has certainly been the best comedy of 2012 so far. I love the fact that they released it during this big voting year. I still wish they would've used this film to portray a serious political message using comedy but I digress. What was funny was really funny. What was lame was really lame. What didn't work, just didn't work. What DID work, worked very well. I'm not going to give spoilers. I would definitely recommend this movie. People who love Will Farrell and silly comedy will love this. People who want seriousness about politics and want a truly smart comedy, will probably be disappointed. Overall, its a very decent film.5/10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sad Commentary on US Politics But Funny Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I guess the best thing to say is that this is not another Will Ferrell phoning it in movie...there is some substance to the overall film, albeit minimal, and there is some pretty good laughs, albeit a lot of really strained potty humor. Bruno Wang did not see this on opening weekend as it did not seem worthy based on the trailers. Given that, Jay Roach delivers a decent and certainly a pertinent comedy just ahead of this year's 2012 election in the USA.Bruno Wang Reviews The CampaignOverall, the film is a satire of the American electoral process...which makes it both funny and sad at the same time. The reality that the American government is bought and sold by large corporations while they play the imbecile plebeians in a game of right versus left or liberal versus conservative is what makes the movie so sad. The laughs come when we experience the totally over the top representations of the two 'sides' bickering and fighting over totally mindless things instead of dealing with actual issues. Does this sound like American politics?Will Ferrell plays a two time congressman, Cam Brady who is running unopposed and sinking due to a sex scandal. In comes the "Motch" brothers (a clear farce on the billionaire Koch brothers) to prop up their puppet candidate, Marty Huggins played by Zach Galifianakis.The movie reaches really hard in a lot of places and the jokes are delivered sparingly and equally as much visual humor to go with the one- liners. Much of the comedy is forced and feels like the writers were just spit-balling. However, the fact is that the film deliberately shoots way over the top in terms of the plot, so it almost makes the humor (or lack of) a little more palpable.While the Motch brothers (Jonathon Lithgow and Dan Akroyd) try to pump up their hand picked puppet, Cam Brady goes on a path of self destruction, culminating in his power hungry wife leaving with the kids. At the same time, Huggins is struggling with his sense of morals and decency and commitment to the community and, in the process, winds up losing his wife and kids--at least emotionally.The film builds to an almost insane satire of the lunacy of politics in America with Cam Brady having sex with Huggins' wife and filming it so that he can put out a 'sex-tape' commercial. As bizarre as that sounds, it winds up garnering Brady a 'bump' in the polls. This is the type of crazy, off the wall, comedy the film delivers.Overall, I give this film a Bruno Wang 3.5 out of 5 stars for some decent laughs and good acting by Ferrell and Galifianakis (albeit typecast roles for both of them). It is worth the ticket so get your popcorn and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laugh out loud funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching a Will Ferrell/Zach Galifiankis movie is not supposed to be an intelligent heartfelt learning experience. It is supposed to be funny. And it is. We laughed 5 times in the first 5 minutes. The movie is cute and raunchy and everyone in the audience was laughing with us. Zach plays the oddball to a tee, and Will is just as over the top as he always is and I love the way he plays the jerk without apologizing. If you like their type of humor (which I do) you will enjoy the movie. So grab a bad of popcorn, but be careful not to choke, some of the comedy comes when you least expect it.We repeated some of the jokes on the way home, that is how funny some of them were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Ferrell as Mitt Romney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Campaign" is yet another film from Will Farrell's own production company (Gary Sanchez Production) so going in I couldn't have been the only one in the audience expecting the worst. And while this film does carry with it the same crude and overlong stigma of past Ferrell-centric films, "The Campaign" will not only exceed the expectations of Ferrell haters, but (unlike many other Gary Sanchez Production's) also sees a comedy that is consistently laugh-out-loud funny. The Plot: The movie stars Will Ferrell as Cam Brady, a long-term congressman out of North Carolina and the type of Republican candidate that ends every sentence with "support our troops". Ferrell is basically doing a watered down version of his own George Bush impression (or a spot on version of Mitt Romney). In a "Trading Spaces" kind of twist, when two conniving CEO's wish to implement an "insourcing" program (basically moving Chinese sweatshop labor into the United States, in order to save the importing cost; or what Walmart wishes that they could do) these two puppet masters put up their own figurehead candidate to challenge Brady. It just so happens that their candidate is the flamboyant, naive and "Pat"-ish Marty Huggins, played by Zach Galifianakis (thankfully playing a significantly different role than he has played in the past). Brady and Huggins then proceed to engage in the weirdest and most corrupt head to head campaign since Bush v. Gore. Jay Roach (Meet the Parents) directs this well done satire of the American political system, and while he does fine work, the real stars of the show (behind the scenes) are the writing team of Chris Henchy and Shawn Harwell. No, this is not a satirical film on the level of Mel Brooks, and yes, there are definitely parts in this film that don't work (the latter half of this film, which is supposed to continue with the heavy American political satire, does crumble into a series of simple sketches) but in the end none of that matters. Why? It is simply because the jokes here are written so well, "The Campaign" becomes immensely funnier than it had any right to be (or would have been with any other writers). The strong supporting cast, including the likes of John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd (as the CEO's) and a hilariously dry performance from Dylan McDermott, also gives "The Campaign" a bit more of a boost when it begins to lose steam after the initial hour.Final Thought: Even though it is the multitude of funny (well written) skits that make this film watchable, as with every successful Will Ferrell film, "The Campaign" is elevated onto that next plateau of comedy, primarily because Ferrell's tiresome SNL routine is diluted by an equally funny co-star (in this case Galifianakis). In short, Ferrell can't carry a movie all by himself. In fact, when talking about the movies where Will Ferrell has been the sole star (focal point) chances are that these are the same films which a majority of audiences found annoying and/or tedious. Think about it. Anyway, back to my review before I am labeled a Will Ferrell hater myself. While "The Campaign" is still not as funny or clever as this year's comedic shocker "21 Jump Street", it is a film very much worth paying to see, even if you are not a big fan of Ferrell or don't think Galifianakis is a worthy successor to Chris Farley.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

		<shortDescription>Political Mudslinging Will Ferrell Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two industrialist goons (played by Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow) need a voice in Congress that they can control. They decide to bring in Marty Huggins (Galifiniakis) to oppose Cam Brady (Ferrell.) With the help of a cut-throat manager, Marty becomes marketable and a legitimate threat to Cam Brady.After that bit of setup, it's political mudslinging Will Ferrell style. And that's not a bad thing. The humor is great - I love seeing the ridiculous predicaments Cam gets himself into. But that's basically all this movie consists of. It's Will Ferrell being awesome as Will Ferrell, but Zach Galifiniakis never really gets a chance to shine. He plays his character perfectly, which is funny in itself, but Marty never really made me laugh as much as Cam did. Maybe its just the way the characters are written ? Marty is a good person while Cam is no doubt an asshole. Or maybe its just that Will Ferrell is an amazing comedic presence and any other actor is better suited to playing off him rather than going head to head against him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny, vulgar and outlandish stuff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clearly an all-star cast in a very funny comedy. I laughed considerably. This film takes hundreds of cliché political campaign material and weaves it into a good story.Very funny,... but nothing really surprising. Motion picture comedy is a very tough business. Will Ferrel delivers exactly what you would expect. He plays four term congressman, Cam Brady, from Hammond, North Carolina. His character is a cross between Ron Burgundy and Ricky Bobby with a dash of his Saturday Night Live parody of George Bush thrown in. Sudeikis plays more the straight man as his campaign manager. Lithgow and Aykroyd are conniving rich corporate power brokers clearly based upon Randolph and Mortimer Duke from Trading Places (1983). Galifianakis show up as a rich boy wimp put up to give Brady a run for his office. The antics though are right out of the nightly news in Washington from Bill Clinton to Anthony Weiner.It is all very funny, vulgar and outlandish stuff. Unfortunately, the writers cross the line when they infuse highly offensive language into the mouths of little children. Comedically, it is not funny and very unnecessary. Hollywood cannot help itself. But I laughed allot and laughter is a good thing so I still gave it a 8.0 rating.There are a few interesting things to note. The downtown set of Hammond, North Carolina clearly seems to be the reconstructed set from Back to the Future (1985). I kept wondering why? Who cares I guess. Chris Mathews makes several cameos as himself without once saying how he has chill up his leg for Cam Brady, but we know he clearly does.College kids and the 20-30 something crowd will love this film. TMG is a few years over that but I think Ferrel is a comedic genius. It is not suitable for young teens so let me rant "Stupid parents out there: Do not send or take your under 15 kids to see this movie." It is rated R for a reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rude, Crude, Vulgar, Basically your typical political documentary, but funnier (and amazingly dirtier)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with a few friends, hoping for a decent film and good popcorn. The latter was lacking, being burnt and under-seasoned. The former was similar to the popcorn, hurting itself by spending too much time presenting vulgar scenes and too little focusing on decent plot or any real depth. Now, this review does contain some spoilers (though nothing like the full movie detail of some reviews), but simply for the sake of revealing what this film has in store.First off, this film is well deserving of its R rating, so children shouldn't be watching this film. There are too many penis jokes to mention, mentions of bestiality (young children admitting to being orally stimulated by goats), explicit sexual themes (a whole section is dedicated to Will Ferrell's character having an affair and showing the porn tape publicly), tons of vulgar language and gestures, and even a situation involving nudity, where a woman's breast falls out of her shirt and the nipple is pointedly displayed (there's no real reason for this, either; she just walks up and lets her breast fall out and they continue the scene). There are certain times where these do make sense, such as the many affairs and scandals that were being revealed (need I mention a certain Anthony?), and they do add to the humor. However, this movie goes too far overboard, and slapstick comedy simply becomes frequently repeated phrases of vulgarities and inappropriate themes. The plot, once found amidst the various scenes of shocking vulgarity, is too disconnected, and simply does not relate well to the characters. This film was not made for plot, but to satire the politicians of today. It could have done this wonderfully, and it had promise; however, it simply goes too far with the slapstick and leaves out the opportunity to make a great comedy.As a crude, tedious, and pointless film, this movie is not one I recommend for anything more than to see how once can put 12 f-bombs, 3 mentions of penises, 4 references to hookers, 2 of female anatomy, and several other curses into a single sentence while in a church. However, for all of its faults, it can be used as a fairly accurate summary of modern politics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terribly Mediocre Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Ferrell plays US Congressman Cam Brady, a hybrid between the suave exterior of John Edwards and the cluelessness that defined his SNL George W. Bush. Out of nowhere comes Marty Huggins, Galifianakis' local North Carolinian tour guide, who is backed by the wealthy Motch brothers (Dan Akroyd and John Lithgow) to challenge the incumbent. I'll be quick; this movie sucked. Ferrell and Galifianakis play roles you've seen them play countless times before, and you've seen them played funnier. The liberal bias, or rather the same bias that continually plays any business as bad business, tries to paint the Koch brothers as devils. It does manage to play both sides as equally clueless at times. The supporting cast was pretty terrible. A profane maid is supposed to inspire laughs but instead is just vulgar and off putting for no discernible reason. The Motch brothers seem to think they can completely alter tax policy by buying a congressional district. A bright spot is Dylan McDermott, the unexplained campaign manager for Huggins. If you have to see it, wait for a rental. Otherwise it's just not worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, if not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A decent comedy featuring Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis as two men running for Congressman of a South Carolina district. Ferrell is the incumbent, a Democrat who is at first running unopposed, but when he is exposed as a sex fiend, two powerful industrialists (Dan Akroyd and John Lithgow, playing the Motch Brothers, parodying the notorious Koch Brothers, who have stupidly bitched about the movie in the media) decide to throw a bunch of money at a Republican opponent. The only person they can find is Zach Galifianakis, a goofy guy with a very normal family and a couple of pugs with which he's obsessed. Things get nasty pretty quickly as Ferrell spies his opponent's weaknesses, and the Motch Brothers respond in kind by sending an evil campaign runner (Dylan McDermott) to groom Galifianakis in dirty politics. This film starts off pretty well, with some huge laughs (particularly the scene where Galifianakis' family admits all the dirty secrets they've been hiding from him), but after a while it kind of fades. It's always pretty funny, but it's almost never hilarious in the latter half. It seems to want to be a biting satire, but it's really not saying anything truly daring, so that never gets off the ground. Ferrell and Galifianakis both give very good performances, but about the only other actor to score any laughs is McDermott. Jason Sudeikis plays Will Ferrell's campaign runner, but has little to do. Lithgow and Akroyd seem like a waste, too, and one wonders why they bothered to hire Brian Cox as Galifianakis' dad (he does have one good scene near the beginning. I did like Karen Maruyama as Cox's Asian maid, whom he pays $50 a day extra to talk like an old-timey black woman. And Sarah Baker is pretty good as Galifianakis' wife. All in all, I did like the film, but I could have waited for video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I went to see the campaign, I watched some of Zach Galifinakis's videos on you tube where he acts as his fiction brother Seth. Knowing that this is the character he portrays closely in the Campaign, I figured that would be a pretty good warm up. I can honestly say that I laughed harder in an 8 minute clip than in a 80 minute movie witch essentially has the same character. This whole movie is too much in your face with obscene comedy just begging for a laugh. Will Ferrell and Zach Galifinakis are two of the funniest people working in comedy today, but they struck out on this one. The few laughs are over crowded by mundane, drawn out jokes that we have all seen before. I was definitely shocked by how bad this movie was. My advice-- watch the you tube clip of Seth Galifinakis and save your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saying that Will Ferrell is funny because of Anchorman, is like saying that Hitler was a great person for bringing Germany out of a depression. He had one big hit and a few other roles that managed to get an audible laugh out of me, rather than the usual snicker, but this is a very rare occurrence.The Campaign is a bad movie. In my life, I have wanted to walk out of two movies (having seen hundreds). The first was John Carter earlier this year and now The Campaign has been added to that list. Will Ferrell is NOT funny in this movie in the slightest. Zach Galifianakis managed to produce a few funny lines but the humour is so dry and recycled that it's hard not to facepalm while watching this movie. When the funniest thing to happen in a movie, is to see an aging comedian punch a computer generated baby, you know something has gone wrong; badly. I WANT to find Ferrell funny. I honestly wish I was brain dead enough to find a single word that comes out of his mouth and link it with humour, but I can't. He plays the same character in every movie and this movie even has a scene that mirrors that of his earlier film when he is tranquilized and falls into a pool. Different environment, same style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a marvelous satire on the American political system. It does a job on the effect of money in politics, the mindset of the social conservatives, the fluff answers to questions in debates, the focus on getting reelected over personal beliefs, and especially the lack of any rules in politics. There are veiled analogies to John Edwards and especially to the Koch brothers, who are famous for giving millions of dollars to Republicans. The guest commentators include Wolf Blitzer from CNN and Chris Matthews from MSNBC from the center and right. I am guessing that Fox News commentators chose not to participate.The movie leaves you with a good feeling when you get out of the theater. I laughed out loud all through the movie.

The film includes a wealth of excellent supporting actors, ranging from John Lithgow to Brian Cox. To give you an idea of how over the top the humor is, the usually riotous Jason Sudeikis actually turns in one of the more sedate performances. Prepare for an unexpected twist at the end, including a clever throw-away line involving the recent Chick-Fil-A controversy.

		<shortDescription>A disappointing political satire/comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into The Campaign, I expected to be a funny comedy. Personally, I love Will Ferrell; I think he's one of the funniest comedic actors in Hollywood. Although he can be crude, he can still make people laugh. Zach Galifianakis is also really funny and can also make people laugh.After seeing the trailers for this movie, I had to go see it. So, I did; and what did I thought about it? Well, I thought The Campaign was a crude political satire/comedy, but it made me had the feeling of disappointment after walking out of the theater. STORY: The Campaign mainly follows two men from North Carolina, and they are running for Congress: Congressman Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) and Tourism Center director Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis). So, they battle out to see who will win the Congress chair.MY THOUGHTS: The humor, although crude, did make me laugh-out-loud at times, but some of the scenes ? that were supposed to be funny ? were a bit cruel. In one scene, you see Brady and Huggins fighting each other; and Brady tries to punch Huggins in the face, but then Huggins moves out of the way, and Brady ends up punching a baby in the face by accident. In another scene when they were fighting, Brady accidentally punches the dog from "The Artist". Those scenes were not funny at all; they were just cruel.I thought the CGI ? for example, the baby - seemed off and completely unnecessary. Yes, I understand that someone like Will Ferrell will never punch an actual baby in the face because it'll make the scene crueler, but CGI has been overused so many times in other movies ? that aren't action-packed ? it just doesn't make the scene effective if they were used horribly. I know this is a nitpick, but I just can't get over it. The characters ? unlike the two leads ? were either stupid or under-developed. The story about two people who are fighting for each other to win Congress seemed to go way too far that it doesn't make it rather entertaining.THE ACTING: Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis both do a solid job playing the two people running for Congress. The supporting cast; like Jason Sudeikis and Dan Aykroyd seem rather wasted.IN CONCLUSION: The Campaign was big disappointment for me. There were moments that made me laugh here and there and Will Ferrell and Zach Galafianakis deliver solid performances, but for the most part, it was pretty bad. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most memorable comedies of '012</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when you thought the Obama/Romney election was the dirtiest off all time, in walks Jay Roach's The Campaign, a sly and unassuming venture into the world of politics, weaving satire and sweetness in for welcomed entertainment. Not long ago, I watched Andrew Fleming's Dick, a clever satire on Richard Nixon's presidency and how two dim-witted teenage girls managed to uncover the Watergate scandal and beat him at his own game. The Campaign doesn't exceed those heights in surprises and observantly funny comedy, but it will provide most moviegoers with sufficient weekend entertainment. And in downtimes like the ones currently upon us, we should try and seek out those films.The plot concerns Democratic Congressman Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) of North Carolina's fourteenth district, who is running for a fifth term unopposed. His numbers, however, are currently down after he leaves a vulgar voice message on a local family's phone about his recent sexual encounter and his affair with a supporter. In the meantime, corrupt business brothers, Glen (John Lithgow) and Wade Motch (Dan Aykroyd) convince local naive tour guide Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis), who is loved by pretty much every person he runs into, to challenge Brady as the Republican candidate so that they can make illegal money off of a Chinese company. Marty agrees and Brady now has a race on his hands.We then venture into the obligatory mud-slinging each side does and how their views have shaped their person overall. One of the most interesting subtle side characters I've seen in a long time is Jason Sudeikis's Mitch, Brady's "yes man" for everything, while Huggins is mainly coached by the pushy, uncompromising Tim Wattley, played viciously by Dylan McDermott.When the mud-slinging goes underway, the jokes become hit or miss. Some instances stretch incredulity to unprecedented lengths, but I believe the reason behind it is to say something. Look where we've been in the political world in the last few years; the Clinton scandal, Obama's birth certificate, and if you want to get even more specific; the Anthony Weiner scandal which everyone loved to talk about a year ago, but now, it takes a minute for the name to ring a bell. Controversies have now been about anything and everything, and with that in mind, The Campaign doesn't seem so incredulous.On another note, it's a shame the film doesn't dive into some true satire heights by taking shots at both Republicans and Democrats alike. It seems that if you are going to make a comedy centered around politics in the year 2012, you should try to take some shots at both political parties and go as far as you possibly can, but The Campaign's centrist view on the entire issue and the bigger picture is a bit underwhelming. Certainly both parties are flawed and equally arbitrary on the basis of their own terms and that alone could've inspired a film that was equal parts satire and relevant humor.Regardless, this is certainly a better Ferrell-vehicle than Casa De Mi Padre or Old School several years back. I too feel people who aren't prepared to subject themselves to The Dictator's completely juvenile and limitless standards will seek this out as a means of easy-going fun. Ferrell immerses himself into the role of a goofy southerner effortlessly, and his fake accent is actually charming and tolerable throughout the film (perhaps I'm still grieving from Adam Sandler's in That's My Boy). Galifianakis perfectly suits his role, as well, and distinctively reminds me of Jack Black's Bernie Tiede in the tragically unseen comedy Bernie. This is a fun, tolerable comedy that doesn't rely too heavily on raunch and four letter words. A bit too much on animal abuse, but still mostly pleasing.Starring: Will Ferrell, Zach Galifianakis, Jason Sudeikis, Katherine LaNasa, Dylan McDermott, John Lithgow, Dan Aykroyd, and Brian Cox. Directed by: Jay Roach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Campaign seems to be the underdog this weekend, the lesser of the two films coming out, with Bourne Legacy being the leading contender. However, I must say that The Campaign is quite worthy as it's one of the funnier films this year so far. Galifianakis and Ferrell are hilarious, with Zach truly shining in a role that goes somewhat against his usual. Both stars, however, let their comedic talents shine, as does who hasn't made a film this funny since Meet The Parents. It's a surprise hit, and contains both plenty of political lampooning and crude material to please even the least political of comedy watchers.Ferrell plays Cam Brady, a slimy politician who has run unopposed as North Carolina's representative for five elections. However, when controversy strikes Cam's campaign and his popularity drops, the influential Motch Brothers (in a parody of the vilified Koch Brothers), with an agenda of their own, look for someone to run against Cam and find Galifianakis' Marty Huggins as their sucker. Thus begins a battle between the awkward Huggins and the smarmy Brady to win the election.Ferrell does what he does best here and plays up his role to hysterics. There's plenty of outrageous behavior here and freaking out. If you're not a fan of Ferrell, then you probably won't like this role either, as it's much the same. Galifianakis is much the opposite, a bit of a straight man who comes off as somewhat socially inept and awkward, although his heart is certainly in the right place. The two bounce off each other wonderfully and the comedy is absolutely hilarious. They are surrounded by a fantastic comedic cast, including Brian Cox, John Lithgow, and Dan Akroyd, who are all very funny in their respective roles. The acting is certainly great, but it would be nothing without a great script, and this is surprisingly good. It's not as high brow or biting as you might expect a political satire to be, but it makes no qualms about pointing fingers and laughing at the ridiculousness of many elements within politics. Most of the satire is pretty ridiculous, from a pornographic PAC ad to several confessions by Higgins family. But it's all very funny and reaches into the sentiments of how most American's view the political landscape right now. Thankfully, the trailers didn't reveal even the funniest parts of the film, and I have to admit I laughed consistently throughout.Certainly, it's not a perfect comedy and doesn't take the place of my favorite comedy of the year so far (that would be 21 Jump Street). The middle begins to lose a little steam and the satire loses a bit of it's laugh out loud appeal. This is partly due to the fact that both Galifianakis and Ferrell don't entirely retain their ability to carry the comedy. But it's very minor, as they more often that not do carry the entire film and do a very good job of it. With a balance between crass, shocking humor and smart, yet simple, political satire, The Campaign accomplishes it's goal of being very funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im still not sure how I ended up seeing this movie, but here I am thinking of the film that stands next to The Green Hornet/Lantern as the worst of 2012. Seriously, it is that bad. Reasons? For One, there is hardly a plot, but old, cliché gimmicks to create a Partner feel in two rascals story. Two? The cast themselves. Now we already know how Sarah Baker has modeled herself on some western woeful pictures from day one, but Zach Galifianakis and Will Ferrell is in way over their head. And worse still, someone like Dan Aykroyd turns in for a very poor cameo. Lastly? Does it work? No. It does not. I don't care if people write reviews stating that a lot of reviewers won't admit they liked the picture. I absolutely hated it.I just want to say this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The characters Zach Galifianakis and Will Ferrell play, talk pure crap. Every word coming out of their mouths just seems to make me angry, because it sounds like she is trying really hard to sound nutty and cool. They just unload so much non-sense that it make watching the film pure hell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What this movie is basically a immature comedy about two candidates going at it with each other. Sort of reminded me of "Bride Wars" except more over the top and it has two guys going at it. One of the candidates is Will Farrell and he is basically Will Farrell in this with a bit of George W. Bush in his character. And he plays a very obnoxious character that is selfish and conceited but tries to act like a good all around American. Which is a lot of politicians are good at. Zach Galifianakis plays the other candidate and he plays a weird character like always but surprisingly he isn't the obnoxious one in this. He is a weird but nice guy that tries to practice what he preach, but he is incompetent. Zach Galifianakis character in this is very different from his previous movies in some regards and original compared to Will Farrell. Both candidates in this are incompetent but like when it comes to voting in the U.S. one will get elected. This movie had some okay satire but it would be more clever if it had more of it. Instead it comes down to immature humor back and forth. They way it pokes fun of the dirty part of political campaigning was somewhat entertaining. This movie isn't clever humor but it's a okay immature comedy. Not all that bad but not good either.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great comedy! Will and Zach do a great job of making fun of both democrats and republicans. It shows what politicians are willing to do in real life to win an election. The cheap shots that both candidates were giving one another is what we are seeing right now with the presidential elections.What I also liked was how republicans were portrayed as they really are: willing to sell themselves to corporations. Once in office, the corporations will have priority over the people who elected them. I know both parties take money from corporations, but republicans forget that they are in office to serve the people and not the corporations.I'm glad the movie brought up the Koch brothers who don't get a lot of media attention but are trying to buy every politician in America. When is America going to realize what these guys are trying to do? They portray themselves as true Americans who care about our country and the citizens, when in fact they are the ones trying to crush the American dream just to make a profit.But despite all of this, you will laugh throughout the entire movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty funny, but a little racist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmm, doesn't really contain spoilers, just the basic plot elements, but figured I'd mark it to be safe.Anyway, some reviews here said it was just over-the-top and not clever, and while that's somewhat true, there haven't been many comedies out lately for which that review would not apply. So I was pleasantly surprised with the writing and the cleverness, and it's everything you would expect from Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis, so if you like those guys (like I do) then you'll enjoy the movie.But it was chock full of the typical Hollywood racism. It's a movie entirely about a bunch of white people, and anyone who isn't white is either blatantly mocked for it or is pointed out for being different. Well actually the only non-white characters were an Asian housemaid and some unscrupulous Chinese factory owners, and anything in the entire movie relating to a different culture (for example the maid faking the accent of a stereotypical Southern black maid, or an old white guy speaking Chinese to the factory owners) was exaggerated and meant to be funny just because it was "weird." Plus the whole plot line is based on the Chinese being evil and employing children at 50 cents a day. Now I'm not saying I'd want my town "sold to the Chinese" to open a sweatshop but they didn't do much to make them seem to be anything but the worst people on the planet. Typical movie crap... it's not like I was expecting an interracial relationship at the center of the movie or god forbid, an Asian-American without an accent living in the South and working on the campaign, but personally, I notice this stuff and I don't like it.So yeah, I give it an 8 as a movie, minus 1 for the typical Hollywood racist crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be running for office!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously both Will and Zack should be running for the presidency of the United States, since they have more character and soul than the actual real-life candidates! "The Campaign" is the perfect summer anti-dote to all the loud, big, overwhelming and formulaic "blockbusters" now ruling a cineplex near you.It is also a timely comedy, since the elections now loom large and in a few months, the American people will go to cast their votes.The movie is short, and that is a good thing, because sometimes the death for these sort of comedies is their interminable running time. For its short duration this comedy packs quite a punch. Will and Zack are the heart of the movie and they have an insane on-screen chemistry.The movie does become loopy at times and veers into the realm of the strange once or twice, but all in all I had a good time watching it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-the-top mudslinging comedy delivers the crazy, not as much the clever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The political campaign system in America has done a good enough job making a joke of itself that "The Campaign" as an idea for a comedy either seems redundant ? or perfect. With contemporary comedy staple Will Ferrell going toe-to-toe for the first time with fast-rising star Zach Galifianakis, there is no cap on the potential for hijinks both absurd and sharp. Although director Jay Roach has ample experience making films that deal with political figures and subject matters, "The Campaign" leans toward the absurd anyway. The film consists of a series of rapidly (and ridiculously) escalating tactics between two candidates running for a North Carolina U.S. congressional seat. Ferrell stars as the incumbent, Cam Brady, who embodies all the superficial fluff of a Southern politician, focused on keeping up appearances and championing his three main platform points: America, Jesus and freedom. Galifianakis plays Marty Huggins, a blissfully quirky local tour guide and child of politics convinced to run for office in the interest of the wealthy and influential Motch brothers (John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd), who unbeknownst to anyone intend to build a massive Chinese factory in the district. "The Campaign" is not shy about making its jab at the corporate interest-driven nature of the political machine. Chris Henchy ("The Other Guys") and Shawn Harwell's ("Eastbound &amp; Down") script goes for the over-the-top, exaggerated approach to satire, imagining how far two candidates would go to sabotage each other. To be fair, "The Campaign" establishes that it's not going to play by normal rules early on, in fact as early as an opening quote from Ross Perot saying politics "has no rules." The whole story is also set in motion after Brady leaves a salacious and vivid voicemail on the answering machine of a young Christian family, a call intended for his mistress. In the real world, that would destroy any campaign, but this is just the starting point for Brady. Later on, for example, but still early in the film, he outdoes Anthony Weiner and Tweets his mistress a picture of his genitals with his pubic hair groomed into a handlebar mustache (we are spared the visual). The film paints Huggins as the underdog you'll want to root for, at least in the beginning. When he agrees to run, he immediately finds Tim Wattley (Dylan McDermott, not Bryan Cranston's character on "Seinfeld") in his house ready to run his campaign, starting with fixing his weak image. For starters, he must get rid of Muffins and Pound Cake, his "Chinese" pugs. Ultimately, it's Wattley who pushes Huggins to play foul. Huggins and Brady exchange blows in what feels like a collection of "what are the worst things you could do while running for office?" scenarios: adultery, punching babies, drunk driving ? you name it. The script assumes that the obvious end goal of winning the election is enough to keep the stakes high, but that's not entirely true. Still, Galifianakis and Ferrell are in top form, and the gags themselves boast a certain degree of cleverness. The political campaign context helps keep most everything fresh and original ? there's no pain induced by feeble attempts at scoring laughs. As for being a smart satire, those thoughts are definitely built into the script, but "The Campaign" ends up too far-fetched to be taken seriously in that regard. It has been so far loosed from reality, and even then, choosing to go after the manufactured, aesthetics-driven nature of political campaigns isn't exactly making a bold statement. Rather, it affirms the average politically jaded person's observations on the whole process. Revelatory socio-political commentary, however, should not be on the list of expectations for an R-rated comedy starring these two buffoons. The degree of absurdity is welcome, even if it ultimately weakens the film's attempt at catharsis as Brady and Huggins stare down their various moral indiscretions and must make some important choices. Countering that, however, are enough personal moments littered throughout to give these characters some sense of humanity. They are somehow grounded enough, in spite of their actions, and are likable the more you can detach who they are from what they do. "The Campaign" succeeds less as a political comedy and more as a comedy that uses politics as its vehicle. It cuts the legs out from under its satire, but delivers on the crazy end of things to a satisfying degree. ~Steven C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Summer Hit but Comedy Classic Miss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ike: Laughing out loud is not my style, but The Campaign forced me! This is the first real laugh-out-loud comedy of the summer put together by comedy visionary, director Jay Roach.Casting selection was easily perfected with Zach Galifianakis and Will Ferrell, a perfect comedic duo. Zach nails his oddball character by being: awkward yet lovable, gay yet straight, pathetic yet effective. Naturally, Will handles himself like he always does, funny enough to make millions.Be assured The Campaign has a number of knee slappers beyond the movie trailer. Allow me to name a few: Minutes of dinner table confessions, bad parenting, animal intolerance, campaign ads that don't add up, less than sexy kitchen sex, and Zach's character alone. Believe me you will get enough giggles on to support your need.If you have read my past reviews, you know I don't let every movie sail off with flying colors. Although The Campaign had mature writing (unlike The Sitter, The Watch, Bad Teacher), The Campaign will fall short of glory due to its incessant cursing and pieces of tasteless humor. The priceless "everlasting classic comedy" can rarely be attained when the writing is riddled with the worst curse words in the business. Again and again I find myself hoping directors will replace pathetic wording with witty brilliance.Jay Roach undoubtedly executed at a high level, creating a blockbuster and one of the best movies of the summer. However, Jay's vision won't be creating an unforgettable comedy.***If you ever get your kids to confess stuff without consequence, you will be sadly disappointed. That's a fact!Courtesy The Rehash Critics -Ike</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Will Ferrell Movie since Step Brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*There are no real spoilers in this review, just some basic plotI was privileged to attend a screening of The Campaign back in May.Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) is a congressman who has never really been challenged. But that changes, as the powerful Motch brothers (Aykroyd and Lithgow) who would have something to gain with Marty Huggins (Zach Galifinakis) as congressman.The movie is absolute comic gold. After the movie, I was wondering who Ferrell was channeling and I'm guessing it was John Edwards. There's nothing mind blowing here. Ferrell's not exactly doing a different character than past films like Talladega Knights and Blades of Glory. But that doesn't mean he wasn't funny. In fact, he was nothing short of brilliant in this particular role.Zach Galifinakis wasn't as good as Ferrell but he had some shining moments, no question. The back and forth battle was just superb. I could've watched those two go at it all day.Roach, the film's director, is no stranger to politics. For the record, this film doesn't lean liberal or conservative. In fact, there's barely any politics in it. All the film tried to do was to one up the ridiculousness of real life campaigns. And they did that real well.Sarah Baker really shined as Mitzi Huggins, Marty Huggins' wife. I hadn't really heard of her before this but I'm sure more work is headed her way. Her role won't make her Melissa McCarthy popular, but still solid. I was disappointed by the Motch brothers plot line. It was forced a little bit. And I didn't think they were very funny on screen.My favorite scene was probably where Marty Huggins' family is confessing their sins. They couldn't show some of the stuff in the Green band trailer, but after that scene, my ribs hurt and I was crying from laughter.So congratulations Chris Henchy and Shawn Harwell for just a fantastic and rich script. And I hope this is the start for another prolific writing team. The best comedy film of the summer (yes, I thought it was better than Ted). And welcome back, Will Ferrell. It's good to see you making great films again.9/10Box Office Prediction: Crowded opening weekend, especially tough opening since they're competing with the same audience for The Bourne Legacy. I say a solid 25-30 million if the marketing campaign is good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All in all this is a funny and entertaining movie in the same key as oddball comedies like Billy Madison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film: The Campaign Studio: Cast: Will Ferrell, Zach Galafanakis, Jason Sudeikis, Dylan McDermott Rating:R Running Time: 85 minutesIf Will Ferrell is the king of outrageously ridiculous characters set in plausible situations (See Old School, Anchorman or Step Brothers) then Zach Galifinakis is the heir to the throne. The comedian who shot to fame after his role as the oddball brother-in- law Alan in the hit The Hangover is fast becoming Hollywood's go-to guy to play extreme eccentrics. (See Due Date or Dinner for Schmucks).You would think the pairing of these two hams in the political comedy The Campaign would be a recipe for the most hilarious movie of the year but unfortunately issues with the script hold this movie back from realizing its full potential.Ferrell plays Cam Brady an incumbent North Carolina congressman who is running for re- election unopposed a fifth time. As a career "America, Jesus, Freedom" platform politician, Brady is acclimated to a lifestyle that few can afford. He's corrupt, he's a philanderer and he's out out of touch with the common man. One doesn't have to look deep to see intentional parodies of politicians like John Edwards or even Mitt Romney. Ferrell&nbsp; borrows from his experience lampooning G.W. Bush during his years at Saturday Night Live and the HBO special You're Welcome America: A Final Night with George W. Bush and creates a genuine amusingly dislikable character. Galifanakis plays Marty Huggins, an innocent effeminate who owns a company that provides tours of Hammond, North Carolina, a town so small it's lone celebrity visitor was Rosie Perez when she got "turned around on the highway". Marty&nbsp;longs for a chance to make his politically powerful father (The Bourne Supremacy's Brian Cox) proud. He gets his opportunity when two unscrupulous businessmen decide to invest in his unlikely campaign against Brady. They plan on having the politician in their pocket to essentially own the town of Hammond. Not only facing an opponent for the first time but one with tons of money and a skilled mysterious campaign manager (Dylan McDermott), Brady attempts to one up his challenger at every turn. He succeeds in imploding and creating collateral damage around him including innocent babies and pets. The premise of The Campaign provides plenty of opportunity for the talented cast to be as funny as we know they all can be.&nbsp;There are campaign speeches that focus on conversations between Chinese Pugs named Muffins &amp; Pound Cake and there are hilarious candidate approved commercials and drunken high speed chases. All in all this is a funny and entertaining movie. Director Jay Roach (Meet the Parents) conducts this film in the same key as oddball comedies like Billy Madison complete with eccentric characters like the Asian maid who speaks in Black antebellum dialect. There was a ton of potential for this to be one of the funniest movies ever with a supporting cast full of "A-list" co- stars including Saturday Night Live star Jason Sudeikis and comedy legends Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow.Disappointingly though, a few huge plot holes and an ending that feels rushed and a by-product of lazy writing prevents this from being as successful and entertaining as I hoped it would have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK but could/should have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited for this and wanted it to be good. It was okay but missed chances to excel. Will Farrell was very much like his Ricky Bobby character (which is good) and did a good job with his role. His Cam Brady was a good blend of crass politician, idiot and selfish boor. Zach G. Was also good and different from Due Date and Hangover. The story, casting and idea were all good but it fell apart as basically several funny skits, most of which were shown in the trailers. It could have been so much more and much funnier. One big peeve is that a scene from the trailers (Cam Brady holding up cigarettes as he is questioned if he is being paid by big tobacco) is not even in the movie. I think the DVD is likely to have a lot of deleted scenes and I wish I had saved my money and seen it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>War has rules, mud wrestling has rules -- politics has no rules.' That's a quote by former American presidential candidate Ross Perot that opens up Will Ferrell's newest comedic offering The Campaign, while also serving as a guideline for some of the outlandishness witnessed over the course of the film.Ferrell plays Democratic congressman Cam Brady from North Carolina who has run unopposed for two election cycles and is the type of politician who is successful because he can dance around the issues with the best of them and gets people riled up with his catchphrase 'America, Jesus, Freedom', even if he himself doesn't exactly know what that means. He has a strong haircut, a large American flag pin on his jacket and has enjoyed overwhelming support in his district with an approval rating in the mid-60 percentile and has the support of his lovely wife Rose (Katherine LaNansa) and children Jessica and Cam Jr.Read my full review at critic ken.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Think of a campaign Borat style and here you have it with all the required political incorrectness. Or think of all the stupidities of a U.S. political campaign and its all here - sex, Jesus, family values and terrorism (but mostly sex). It's a hilarious performance by both Will Ferrell and Zach Galifiankis. There are a lot of great lines with the dirty political jockeying. They start playing hard-ball quickly and Cam Brady's novice rival for office, Marty, is a quick learner. The bad- mouthing, the political word spins ("in sourcing" was one of them) and the punching is just so much fun and sadly close to the truth (or maybe it is the truth). It's great stuff!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you see Will Ferrall in a movie, you know that it's likely to be funny. With Zack Galifanakis, you know that it's going to be hilarious. And when you see that credit telling you that Jay Roach directed this picture, you know that it's going to be nothing short of brilliant."The Campaign" is a movie with non-stop laughs - so much that the theater fills to it's brim with a beaming storm of laughter. The jokes are original and, put quite accurately, hysterical.Chris Henchy's script is filled with unnecessary and pushy vulgarities as well as heavy sexual remarks that continue to bring our society down. However, the actual story is simple. And a simple story is no flaw to a movie. A simple story does not make a movie less entertaining. In this case, the sequence of events come so beautifully and easily that you as the viewer are not left struggling to keep up with what is going on. There is no fighting between the audience and the story in this film. Instead, they work together flawlessly.Despite the film's premise, you do not need know a single thing about politics to understand the film. The film, although about two candidates struggling to become congressmen, really shows us what characters played by Will Ferrall and Zack Galifanakis will do to win. I'm sure you can only imagine what could happen.Between every laugh, the understandable story and original characters are able to teach us a lesson or two - perhaps about politics, or even the way we live our lives in general. It is a story about obedience, honestly, and doing what is truly right.Ferrall, Galifanakis, Sudeikis and McDermott sink beautifully into their roles. Even though the The Oscars rarely seem to take notice of comedies, Zack Galifanakis truly deserves an Oscar for the child-like man he becomes in this film.Overall, the film is hilarious. There are scenes in this movie that will definitely make you laugh. In some cases, they focus on the stupidity of these characters which gets conveyed so comedically powerfully that you become truly mesmerized. Other times, the level of intelligence at which these jokes are played at is remarkable. They are perfectly timed, both in regards to how they were edited in the movie, as well as at what point in time we are politically at this moment of time in history.Seeing the "behind the scenes" work of a campaign has just become a whole lot funnier. These opponents want to win, and through advertising, put each other down while doing so. Much of the movie is about retaliation - what the other person does in response to being criticized. And remember, this is Will Ferrall who is reacting to what Zack Galifanakis said about him on TV, so you can only imagine how extreme things can become.10/10 - SEE THIS MOVIE!I'm an IMDb user, and I approve this message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>long anticipated slapstick comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We audience were waiting for a movie to make us laugh from the start till the end but we were pretty much darned because of sexual innuendos used in the movies which made us close our kids' sight during the movies. One of the worst things is confronting with unexpected story developments with a lot of puns which make me think they are unnecessary. I believe and root for the idea of non sexual contents to make movies reach their target of getting the audience near bursting into laughter mode. Real comedy movie lovers do not really like sex and nudity in the movies at all. The Campaign is one of them to me .I would totally fall in love with this movie if there was limited or no sexual content in it . Farrel's teaming up with Hollywood's funniest looking dude Zack is just a diamond in comedy genre. This movie captivated me although i was not expecting it to be well done. The script is too simple and it's simplicity is one of the key roles for comedy genre. You pretty much know what is going on then you feel the engrossing scrip to hit you more with laughs. Jokes are pretty well embellished with witty quips. Zack's awesome look has been conveyed from Hangover sequels but he is not weird in character as he is in the Campaign. I am not going to spoil the movie with telling you what the movie is about . If you are on IMDb to read the reviews to decide what movie you really want to watch I can recommend you this movie as it wont surprise you at all.I WARN YOU FOR THE SEXUAL CONTENT and it is an R rated movie. There are a lot of elements comprising this movie to be a funny one except for the need for the sexual content . The cast and screenplay are intertwined to make the audience laugh and have awesome time . I rate this movie 8 out of 10. There is nothing falling short . Cinematography has not been tainted by the director. I really appreciate this movie to be one of the rarest for a long time . Kudos to Farrel and Zack. they were darn awesome !!</fullReview>
