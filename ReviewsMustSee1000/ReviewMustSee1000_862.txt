		<shortDescription>Hilarious from start to finish !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the funniest films I've seen, Rita Moreno is excellent as Googie Gomez failed Broadway star and now singing in "the pits" at the Gay bathhouse "The Ritz"...Treat Williams had me in stitches with his voice and Jack Weston is superb as the man on the run and hiding "in the last place anyone would look for me"...Although this harks back to a time now gone the comedy is still as fresh as ever. Look out for the "Chubby Chaser" who constantly refuses to have anything to do with Lean muscled Treat because he's too skinny and chases Jack Weston around from start to finish! And the Andrews Sisters skit is a hoot.... If you haven't seen this film what are you waiting for..!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just possibly the funniest film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one shows this since the advent of AIDS. That's a pity, because if it isn't the funniest movie ever made, it's awfully close. Great adaptation of the Broadway hit play, with wonderful performances by Jack Weston, Rita Moreno, Jerry Stiller, F. Murray Abraham, Paul Price, and Treat Williams. I can't praise this one highly enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Never Laughed So Hard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was 1976, Tehran Iran. Terry, also American, and I were bored at work and on the spur of the moment decided to skip out and check out the Tehran Film Festival. Boy, did we have no idea what we were getting in for.It just so happened that the next film on the bill was The Ritz. We knew nothing about it, but we hailed our driver, raced downtown to the theater, and made it in just in time.Before long, we were rolling on the floor. Truly, we couldn't hold on to our seats, I can't speak for Terry but the tears were just pouring down my face from laughter. And what made this worse was that, in a mostly packed theater, it seemed that most of the time the two of us near the back were the only ones laughing. Oh, every once and while the Farsi sub-titles would catch-up and the rest of the theater would let out a good laugh, I guess they were having a good time, but it was amazing to us how much was being missed, even some of the visual humor.I suppose we were both just overdo for some comic relief, but I've watched this film again through the years and it remains one of the funniest films I have ever seen. Jack Weston as the everyman-victim is perfect, as is Rita Morena as a never-quite-been, trying with varying degrees of success, to retain her dignity, her temper, and her dreams. And the rest of the cast -- who can you fault? Yes, from the dark opening deathbed scene, to all the madcap mistakes that follow, this is farce that at times sinks almost as low as the Three Stooges, but keeps sailing from floor to floor with surprise laughs at every turn.Some folks can't seem to get past the subject matter, I guess. But if you can find this movie, and you can open your mind beyond the lifestyle to just enjoy all the zaniness that happens, then hang on to your towel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Break Out The Bath Towels: The Ritz Is One Of The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chunky, quivering, middle-class ordinary Gaetano Proclo (Jack Weston) is 'married to the mob' in the form of wife Vivian (Kaye Ballard)--and his crazy brother-in-law Carmine (Jerry Stiller) hates him. Certain that Carmine is about to kill him, Gaetana hops a cab, tells the driver to take him to the last place any one would ever look for him... and suddenly finds himself hiding out in the middle of a gay bath house.But this only the first ten or fifteen minutes of the film: there is much, much more to come, and all of it is over the top hilarious. Jack Weston, Jerry Stiller, and Kaye Ballard are perfectly cast in their roles, but would you believe F. Murray Abraham (Oscar winner for AMADEUS) as the screaming queen to end all screaming queens? How about Rita Moreno as a no-talent lounge singer who is busting a gut to become a bath-house star just like Bette Midler? Or Treat Williams as a P.I. with blonde hair and a squeaky voice? My own favorite of the bunch is Paolo Poeti as Claude, a "chubby chaser" who takes one look at Jack Weston and falls in love at first sight--and then proceeds to make his life absolute hell by chasing him all over the bath house. Before it's all over you'll find people hiding under beds, thrown into swimming pools, impersonating the Andrews Sisters, and being pursued by unwanted lovers of the wrong persuasion, all to absolutely hilarious, incredibly giddy effect.Like most farces, THE RITZ deals in stereotypes--but it is never mean spirited in its portraits, and the cast carries off the eccentric characters (both straight and gay) with considerable aplomb. Filmed long before the AIDS crisis, THE RITZ offers a comic look at a New York gay bath house and a way of life that would soon come to a grinding halt--a fact that gives the film a certain unintended poignancy for gay viewers. Even so, you don't need any specialized background to enjoy this laugh-out-loud movie, which is as much (and really more) for a straight audience as it is for a gay one. Highly, highly recommended... call over some friends, turn up the steam heat, break out some bath towels, and get ready for a true laugh riot.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had caught this zany gay bathouse farce years ago and remembered it during a recent discussion of the gay subculture with a gay friend of mine. I wondered if the movie would be considered offensive by/to gays. Having seen it again, I would think not, and at least one gay reviewer here agrees with me. With mistaken identities, misunderstood intentions, and straight cluelessness, it is a hilarious comic romp. All the participants put in excellent comic work here. Rita Moreno, as mentioned often here, is particularly wonderful as the hopeless but aspiring singer - the accent is a hoot. Hard to find nowadays, but definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is this great comedy not available in the US? When I checked the listings, it's only on a PAL VHS tape ... I can view other region DVDs on my computer, but have no way of viewing PAL VHS. This movie which I saw several times when it was new, is one of the funniest films you'll ever see. It's based on a Broadway play but you'd never guess its source as, unlike many movies made from plays, it's not stagebound. The characters and the situation make for nonstop action and absolutely terrific one-liners. Treat Williams is indeed well named for he is a treat as the detective. You'll howl at the predicaments Jack Weston gets in. And you'll love Rita Moreno who proves to be a comedic gem. "The Ritz" is high on the list of best cinematic comedies and whoever owns the rights should release it in a wide-screen DVD version. It's sort of like a Noel Coward play updated to a "modern" bathhouse ... jokes on the screen overflow to keep the viewers happy and having a terrific time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rita Moreno Is Priceless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sweet and hysterically funny film based on a hit Broadway play by Terence McNally,THE RITZ is a 1970s New York City bath house. Into this asylum of loony characters comes Gaetano Proclo (Jack Weston), a man in disguise running from his hateful brother in law (Jerry Stiller).Weston immediately meets up with several crazy gay men and gets involved in a show. Chris (F. Murray Abraham) decides to show him the ropes but things get manic when a chubby chaser (Paul B. Price) sets his heart on Weston. In the meantime, Stiller has a sent a naive detective (Treat Williams) to find Weston. Amid the confused identities and chases in and out of rooms, we also meet the immensely untalented Googie Gomez (hysterically funny Rita Moreno) who sings at the clubs, hosts the talent show, and is always on the lookout for a big-time producer. Of course Weston and Williams assume she's a male transvestite.Stiller soon arrives and starts shooting up the place, but he's followed by his wife (Kaye Ballard) who is assumed to be a man! Stiller and Ballard arrive as the talent show opens with Moreno fracturing lyrics in Puerto Rican as she sings "Everything's Coming Up Rose's" and "Begin the Beguine." Moreno specializes in show tunes since she was fired from both "The Sound of Music" and "Camelot" by the infamous producer Seymour Pippin.Everything comes to a head when Weston, Price, and Abraham disguise themselves as the Andrews Sisters to hide from Stiller. They mime a funny "Gay Caballero" number and bring down the house.Many of the stars here were in the original Broadway production: Moreno (who won a Tony Award), Weston, Abraham, Stiller, Price, and the chorus boys (John Everson and Christopher J. Brown). And along with Williams and Ballard, we also have Bessie Love (Maurine) and Dave King (as Abe) co-starring. And look for John Ratzenberger (TV's "Cheers") and Peter Butterworth and Leon Greene (both from "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum").Although the film takes place in a gay bath house, the film is extremely funny and not offensive. This is a sweet, pre-AIDS gay comedy with a terrific cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A well crafted, door-slamming comedy ala 'Noises Off' with a wonderful cast. Rita Moreno playing a no-talent bathhouse singer gives the performance of her lifetime (we all know how talented she really is, so seeing her 'off' is a lot of fun). Treat Williams is delicious as the soprano detective. Jack Weston, Paul B. Price, F. Murray Abraham, Kay Ballard and Jerry Stiller add their spices to this wonderful ensemble. It makes you wish that the days of the Continental Baths would come back - at least the wonderfully tacky shows at poolside!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are times when a play is very successfully made into a movie, but not usually a comedy. The Lion In Winter was a very successful transformation form the stage to the big screen by James Goldman, author of both, and brother of William Goldman, a highly well thought of screenwriter. But all of that aside, if you would like to forget your troubles and simply laugh yourself into exhaustion, I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zany.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE RITZ is a zany and broadly played little farce directed by Richard Lester. It is an adaptation of a Broadway play by Terrence McNally, later acclaimed for MASTER CLASS and the hit musical THE FULL MONTY. It is set in a New York club-bath for gays. Dying gang leader George Coulouris tells his son Jerry Stiller and daughter Kaye Ballard that he wants Ballard's husband, Jack Weston, a Cleveland sanitation company owner, to be killed. That's the only plot there is. Weston tells a cabbie to take him to a place where no one will suspect he is hiding. Enter "The Ritz," a seedily elegant gay paradise with its clients that include self-mocking F.Murray Abraham, and chubby-chaser Paul B. Price. The cast is uniformly amusing, especially Rita Moreno as Google Gomez, an untalented Latin singer whom Weston mistakes for a drag queen. She frequently steals the show from everyone. Moreno got a Tony Award for her Broadway portrayal of that role. Also good is the improbably squeaky-voiced detective played by Treat Williams. Some of the resulting mayhem is very funny indeed; some stretches are more ho-hum. Nevertheless, it is a generally successful piece of entertainment regardless of one's sexual orientation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First seen in 1976 as a trailer to main movie, it proved to be one of the most memorable films I have ever seen. Much of its commentary is starkly relevant today. Rita Morino was so outrageous, her lines have stayed in my head all these years!! It (somewhat sarcastically)challenged the stereotypes of gays, drag queens, Italian families, and societal values/conceptions in general.Each actor plays their part to a tee......so very convincingly. This is a comedy classic.A funny, pleasing film which, without offending, leaves one feeling good about themselves - gay and straight alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This has got to be the earliest non-homophobic and non-offensive gay movie (by my standards anyway)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be the earliest non-homophobic and non-offensive gay movie (by my standards anyway). 1976! It's based on a play by Terrence McNally - whom I think is gay - and he also wrote its screenplay. It also features most of its original Broadway leads, including, notably, F. Murray Abraham and Rita Moreno.The Ritz is a screwball comedy about a clueless man trying to elude his murderous brother-in-law by hiding out in a bathhouse, which, unbeknownst to him, is very much a gay hangout where men not only have sex with each other but also feature performances by singers and talent shows.Handled by a tactless director or screenwriter, this movie could've been offensive on so many levels, and I, being easily offended enough to be a GLAAD watchdog, was very happily surprised to fully enjoy the movie. Sure there were the stereotypical portrayal of gay men as nellies, but they were part of a variety that also included muscle hunks, lean twinks, leather daddies, and chubby chasers.The actors have a lot of fun with their roles. The clueless straightys include the chubby Jack Weston, who, as you might guess, gets chubby chased, and a young and sexy Treat Williams as the detective trailing Weston. Well sexy when he kept his mouth shut anyway. You'll find out what I mean...Gay bathhouses used to feature female singers and Bette Midler got her start in them, which is why she's such a gay icon. Rita Moreno is this bathhouse's diva, and she gives a lively performance that treads the ideal line between portraying and caricaturing a spitfire Latina.But the eye-pop award goes to F. Murray Abraham, whose most famous role is Antonio Salieri in Amadeus. Yes, Salieri unabashedly plays a flouncy flamer in this movie! Much credit goes to him for tackling the role with gusto yet not going over the top with flailing arms and lisping and all the other stereotypes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Putting out The Ritz!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can not understand why this classic comedy made back in 1976 has not been released on DVD, unless homophobic interests are holding it back. An all-star cast including Ritz Moreno, Jerry Stiller (dad of actor Ben), F. Murray Abraham and a young Treat Williams, bring Terrence McNally's play to the screen with laughs for all - gay or straight. Ms. Moreno won a Tony award for her stage performance as "Googie Gomez", an aspiring Broadway star entertaining in a Gay bathhouse. "Googie" is so bad...she's fantastic! Others in the cast are Jack Wesson, Kaye Ballard and pre-Cheers star - John Ratzenberger. IT'S OUT! Finally, Warner Brothers released it on DVD today (1/8/08) and while waiting this long is too long, I guess I would say it was worth the wait. Great widescreen transfer. I wish there had been more extras like cast commentary. Only extras are theatrical trailer and both English and French subtitles. Wonder why not Spanish?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love the film, but I wonder about Rita...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always loved the film; I even went to the premier in NYC. I fell in love with, as many of us did, with the Rita Moreno's character of Googie Gomez. She is still in 2005 as fresh as she was almost 30 years ago. HOWEVER...when I heard that Ms. Moreno was going to be appearing in my favorite little 100 seat cabaret in San Francisco, just a few days after 09/11/2001, I jumped on Delta to San Francisco just to see her. I mean-just to see her. I arrived at 5PM and flew back at midnight. This was the first day that the planes were flying after 09/11 and people were not yet comfortable and having fun yet. In fact, during her show to only about 40 of us, she commented on "those bastards" not getting us down and she put on a fantastic show. Then after the show, she came out and spoke with everyone and was well received. However (as I said) when I mentioned to her how much I loved "her" Googie Gomez, her entire body language, tone and attitude changed to me. She immediately changed the subject and when I brought up Googie again, she really seemed "pissed off."Does anyone have any thoughts about this or have they encounter Ms. Moreno, who is still tops in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in the 70's, and have never forgotten it. When I tried to rent it at local movie outlets-no luck. It was like Christmas in July, when I finally located it on e-bay. This has to be one of the funniest movies ever made..even my politically correct daughter couldn't stop laughing. The movie is so well done-giving the actors freedom to do things we are not used to seeing them do. Its hard to decide who's my favorite-gogi gomez I think. Rita Moreno is unbelievably funny. Those who take offense to comedy about gay society, should chill out and watch this. Its not so much about being gay, as it is about learning to accept differences. I love it love it love it.

		<fullReview>This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and I've never talked to anyone else who's seen it. The casting is spot-on, with F. Murray Abraham especially effective as Jack Weston's Queen Mentor. The young Treat Williams is probably unrecognizable to his modern fans. The old pros -- Jack Weston, Rita Moreno, and Jerry Stiller -- are, of course, perfect. Rent it if you can find it, then sit back and enjoy a wild ride. 6-3-2012 I just watched The Ritz the first time in many years, and it's still outstanding. It's so good, in fact, that I looked up the play on ibdb.com, and was delighted?but not surprised?to learn that Rita Moreno had been awarded a Tony for her performance. She is off-the-chart great in this film. I also learned from the Broadway data base that Jack Weston, F. Murray Abraham, Jerry Stiller, and Paul Price were also in the original Broadway cast. That goes a long way to explaining why this is such a good movie. The play had been closed for less than a year when the film was released, so it seems that Richard Lester simply assembled the most important original cast members and filmed the play. Well done to him!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For anyone who has seen the umpteen productions of "Gypsy" on Broadway, I dare you to not hear the song "Everything's Coming Up Roses" and think of Rita Moreno's hysterical performance as Googie Gomez, singing the song "fresh from her appearance in a bus and truck production of "Fiddler on the Roof".", deserving a second Oscar to go with hers from "West Side Story". Anita was a good hearted spitfire who provided spark yet understanding to the doomed love story in "West Side Story", but Moreno deliciously spoofs the Hispanic stereotypes she has faced by joyously jumping into the film version of a play she had done on Broadway. "Ju thought I vas a drag quin?", Moreno lusciously asks the straight Jack Weston, hiding in a gay bath house from his mobster brother-in-law (Jerry Stiller) and fighting off passes from a balding, hairy chubby chaser. There's the extremely effeminate F. Murray Abraham who also quotes "Gypsy" by squealing as he enters a sauna, "Hello everybody, My name's June! What's yours?" and desperately inviting people to an orgy in his private room, and squeaky, soprano voiced Treat Williams as the straight private investigator hired by Stiller to trap Weston. Add on the fantastically funny Kaye Ballard as Weston's wife who disguises herself as a man to enter the bathhouse, and you've got one of the most delicious farces ever to transfer from stage to screen.While there's plenty of bare male upper torsos, there's nothing offensive in this gay comedy of errors where something dirty might be going on behind closed doors, but none of it is shown on-screen. It's certainly better than the same year's horrible adaption of "Norman, Is That You?", and a far cry from the sometimes funny but ultimate tragic screen version of "The Boys in the Band", but certainly, any gay themed movie in the mid 1970's was ahead of its time, even if it did have some stereotypical characters. Yes, these types of characters do exist, and there are the archetypes of all of them, from effeminate Abraham to the various macho, butch men who have their noses in the air anytime something less than their type approaches them. Veteran early sound actress Bessie Love has a late career appearance, ironically as a receptionist in the front lobby of the bathhouse. Another highlight is when three of the men gather together for a talent show to sing "Three Caballeros" (after another contestant has just done a wretched rendition of "Life is Just a Bowl of Cherries"), making this just truly a gay old time that is truly irresistible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1976'a "The Ritz," based on the Broadway play by Terrence McNally, is an absolute riot.On the run from the brother-in-law Carmine (Jerry Stiller) who's trying to kill him, Gaetano Procio (Jack Weston) orders a cab to take him someplace where no one can find him. The cabbie takes him to The Ritz, a gay bathhouse. There, Gaetano meets some bizarre characters: a chubby chaser (Paul Price); a macho man with a high voice (Treat Williams); Puerto Rican entertainer Googie Gomez (Rita Moreno) whom Gaetano assumes is a drag queen; his own wife (Kaye Ballard) who comes searching for him dressed as a man; and someone just there to party and enter the talent contest (F. Murray Abraham).The laughs are non-stop in this somewhat dated but very funny movie, complete with a talent show where Weston is one of the Andrews sisters, mistaken identity, and Googie's unbelievable nightclub act, during which she sings "Everything's Comin' Up Roses." The performances are all terrific, but Moreno has the killer role as Googie, who claims a producer named Seymour Pippin got her fired from both Sound of Music and Camelot. Kaye Ballard has a scene at the end of the film that had me screaming with laughter. She is just fabulous.Truly a no-miss. Unfortunately they don't make this kind of comedy any longer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tries Hard To Be Funny - Way Too Hard!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw The Ritz for the first time after hesitating for years. As a gay man who came out about 10 years after this film's release, I am well aware that the depiction of homosexuals in films from this period and before was never anything other than mocking or sinister or criminal. This movie tries hard to be funny. Jack Weston is, of course, a great comedian. Jerry Stiller as an Italian gangster tries but fails. Rita Moreno as a cabaret singer at the club is funny to some but foolish to me. While not "offensive" to gays, per se, it's very patronizing which is nearly as bad. This is because it's a product of it's time. The idea, for instance, that Moreno would work at this club and continually refer to the men as "maricon" and mean it isn't very funny to me. 2 of the 4 stars go directly to Treat Williams and his toweled body. He's stunning to look at and has his funny moments. Still, it's all "much ado about absolutely nothing" and it just goes on way too long. If it were a skit in a comedy revue lasting, say, 15 or 20 minutes then I might be on-board but at the end of the day this film lost me and it's jokes just don't stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this on late-night television some time in the late seventies or early eighties, just before AIDS made the headlines. Later, I - in my teens - rather naively wondered why it never reappeared. Of course, the AIDS crisis made this film - with its references to anonymous gay sex as plot devices - "too much", and it was quickly forgotten. This kind of shrugging off of unpleasant memories happens all too often, and is unfortunate. One needs to acknowledge a few key facts with respect to The Ritz:First, that the setting was, to some degree incidental. As with any great farce, the story could have been transplanted with relative easy, only losing some bite and a few twists.Second, that the setting, which was very timely for the mid-seventies, was the very thing that provided the twists that made the movie so hilarious and unique. At the time of the Ritz's theatrical release gay bathhouses were the subject of much discussion, and drew a certain level of public disapproval and debate.Third, that good snapshots of a particular time do not necessarily seem all that appealing in retrospect - usually because they capture the warts-ridden realities. In the seventies this seemed understood, and a number of movies exploited this fact, having at their hearts a meanness about the times being portrayed. With the eighties there seemed to be a desperate need for unconditional nostalgia, and since then a number of great movies have lost their once-acknowledged significance (why do so few people, other than movie critics, fondly remember America Graffiti while the saccharine Grease is so celebrated?).Too bad, particularly for a movie like The Ritz; it may have been the last great farce, with its superb cast - Moreno and Williams both pull out all the stops - fantastic timing, and outrageous gags. And it could only have managed to be a great farce in the very jaded seventies by dealing with such timely subject matter.Hopefully the film will be rediscovered via a film festival, or a more serious Remember When television or radio show. However, I fear that popular culture has grown far too shallow, and, despite all the avenues for cultural archeology, films such as The Ritz have been buried way too deep by the sands of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** It's was when on his deathbed Papa Vespucci's,George Couloris,last wish before he finally checked out was to "Get Proclo". That meaning to rub his son in law Gaeanto Proclo, Jack Weston, out which set the stage for him, after Papa's funeral, taking off to the one place on earth that no one will find him at "The Ritz" gay bathhouse in Greenwich Village where he thought he'll be safe. It turned out to be a night of horrors for Proclo but in the end it exposed his insane with hatred brother in law and co-owner of his garbage company Carmine Vespucci, Jerry Stiller,as the hypocrite, in claiming to be a God fearing family man, that he really was.As soon as Proclo checked into "The Ritz" he was accosted and chased by the sex starved Claude Perkins, Paul B. Price, a notorious "Chubby Chaser" who's got this things about fat men which Proclo, weighing in at some 220 pounds, is a perfect specimen. It's Carmine's plan not to rub out his brother in law but catch him in bed with another man to destroy his being in the family garbage business at take it over all for himself. There's also the high pitched but Alan Ladd looking PI Michael Brick, Treat Williams, who 's job it is to get Proclo into a compromising position and photograph him in it by his boss Carmine Vespucci. This backfires on Carmine in that Brick for most of the movie mistakes Carmine for Proclo in not knowing, he only communicated with Carmine by phone or behind closed doors, which is which.***SPOILERS**** Hysterically funny movie with the also failed Broadway actress Googie "Google" Gomez, Rita Merino, trying to impress Paoclo whom she mistakes for a big time Broadway producer to get the lead role in the play, both that he's to produce, "Oklahoma" or "The Sound of Music" in that she feels that she's be perfect in the lead role of each of them. It's in the end that not only is Carmine the super macho family man found out to be the owner of "The Ritz", and possibly a "fruitcake" himself, but the person who tricked Proclo to end up being there! And an even bigger shock Brick's uncle turns out to be a big Broadway producer who can get Googie a role in his next big Broadway play who just happens to be non other then Seymour Pippins! The very man whom Googie blames for destroying her very promising acting &amp; singing career!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to differ from the other comments posted. Amid sporadic funny moments, there are a lot of actors trying too hard to be funny. The strain shows. I watched this with two friends on another friend's recommendation- none of us were thrilled.</fullReview>
