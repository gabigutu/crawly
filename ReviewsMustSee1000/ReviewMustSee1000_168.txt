		<shortDescription>Very beautiful and compelling, but perhaps not for every one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had absolutely no idea what to expect when I watched 'Hable Con Ella'. All I knew was that it was directed by Pedro Almodovar, who is considered as one of the biggest talents outside of Hollywood. Well, he certainly has some talent. A talent to make movies that are not always easy to watch, but certainly thought provoking, beautiful, compelling and stylish.'Hable Con Ella' tells the story of two men who are in love with a woman in a coma and how they both handle this in a different way. They meet each other in the hospital with a beautiful friendship between the two men as a result. Pedro Almodovar is some kind of artist who likes to paint with words and images. As a result you get a beautiful tale about obsession, love, friendship and desperation, which may not be to everybody's taste because of the bizarre subject, but which certainly touched me. It's very original and I would recommend it to everybody who isn't afraid to watch a movie with a special subject. I give it a 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps Almodovar's greatest work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many who say that "Todo Sobre Mi Madre" is his best film, but now that I've seen both these movies, I give the nod - by a long way - to "Hable con Ella". This is a masterpiece, and not just because of the poignancy of the characters, or the story in general, or the way the scenes are shot - watching the matador get dressed was quite engrossing - but EVERYTHING comes together so wonderfully. The brilliance of Spanish-language films never fails to amaze me, and this is another one in that long line of greatness. There will be times where the viewer may feel somewhat uncomfortable with the characters and their actions, but that does not stop Almodovar from exploring such emotions; indeed, one sometimes gets the impression that Almodovar's entire purpose is to make you analyze your own feelings - and simply does it better than anyone else. Recommended for anyone who can read subtitles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine, disturbing work of art about selfish "love."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a hard time getting around this movie right after seeing it. Something was not quite right, something disturbing. But after sleeping on it I think I have it figured out.I know people read these to find out if a movie is good or not. It is good. It's an effective piece of art which has an interesting and original inner voice. It's thought-provoking.But it doesn't leave you with anything to hang your hat on. You are not going to come out relating to the characters or situations. Not right away, not until you've digested the whole and figured out what part of it is universal to you.*spoilers galore*The key to Marco &amp; Benigno's relationship is that they both don't listen to women - the title of the film can throw you off this trail a bit. They don't listen - and they don't want to.Marco didn't want to know that this woman wasn't really in love with him. After all, he swept in when she was on the rebound and he "knows desperate women" by his own admission - or does he not really know them, rather, always swoops in like this? That would explain a lot - he has a hard time with normal relationships. He likes a girl on the rebound, or desperate for some reason. He doesn't really want to cope with real love, he just want s his own thing. -He is selfish. This is not the way one loves. Love is something that is not for you, it is for the one you love.Does he then gain anything from his friend's problems &amp; suicide? I don't know. But I think in the end that he doesn't. Maybe this is why it is a disturbing film. He is back to crying at this experimental dance. He has already gone back to traveling around on his own instead of leading a life with people. He is back to getting involved with a girl who has problems (girl coming out of a coma counts, I'd say).Meanwhile, his friend Benigno is the ultimate in "doesn't listen." He idolized this girl from afar, then found the perfect relationship when she couldn't communicate at all. But she was (communicating) - she was saying *nothing* at all, and he was projecting for her. He knew that, in fact, but that didn't matter to him.Finally, he rapes her under the pretense that she has actually been communicating with him, in the way he wants. Rape is, of course, the ultimate in selfish love. It is an act which defines how "selfish love" is really an oxymoron - it's not love at all. He feels his half of the relationship is enough to make a whole. This is the ultimate loner, I'd say. And we know he never learns, never grows, nothing. He ends up committing suicide. The ultimate in despair.One might say that Benigno was "good" b/c he had cared for this girl all this time. But that is not what "good" is. He is not caring for her out of dedication to his profession. He is not caring for her out of love. He is doing it b/c he needs it for his own selfish purposes - that is how he feels love. I suppose b/c that is what he had with his mother.So there is a reason, seemingly - his mother. That would be too easy, though, to just let him slide b/c of that. And to do so, one would have to project something not in the film - we never actually know what the relationship was with this mother.So then, it's not black &amp; white, but still definite, I think, all reasons aside, in that he is not "good." In fact, I think he has severe problems.And Marco relates to him...Perhaps it's hopeful in that ultimately it lays the blame on the characters themselves and doesn't say this is some bigger, unresolveable problem. But from what I saw, it's still pretty depressing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talk to Her-Almodovar goes left field-with tragedy and emotion in brilliant fashion!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating **** out of ****Spanish Writer-Director Pedro Almodovar is a filmmaker that always captures strange, and honest moments within his characters emotions-especially women. Such films as "All About My Mother", and "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" support this, but in Almodovar's latest film "Talk To Her"--he does something a little different by making men the protagasnits. It's brilliant, unique, and creative filmmaking at its best. However beneath all the brilliance is a lovely, sweet film that is charming in its own little way.Almodovar crafts "Talk to Her" with a style that is unique in color and tone, and it has behavioral exposition that is far more mature and tonally sustained than anything he's done before. But the plot is insane as anything that Almodovar's has done before, which makes the movie more of a career-peak change, its a masterpiece constructed on the solid foundation of everything he's previously tried and learned. The movie's great, bad-boy conceit is that its two heroes, wounded-in-love journalist Marco (Dario Grandinetti) and naive nurse Benigno (Javier Camara), are hopelessly in love with women they can't communicate with -- and that really gives the two guys something to talk about, as well as a base for the strongest of friendships. Not that their women are intentionally unreachable; both, you see, are in comas.By the end of this crazy, heart-thrilling tale, Almodovar has delivered us through un unexpecting film of humor, human emotions, specific human connections, remorse, and philosophies. "Talk to Her" is more than just a run of a talked about foreign film, and having Oscar-Nomination potential-it is one of the best movies of 2002.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Benigno and Marco are both lonely men, Marco because his lover, a woman bullfighter, is in a coma, Benigno, a thirty-year old virgin Momma's boy, from habit. Both are in love, too (Benigno, a male nurse at the clinic, slavishly tends Alicia, a comatose accident victim, for a living). It is he who gives Marco, with whom he strikes up a friendship, the eponymous advice: talk, and your heartfelt monologue will be more meaningful and therapeutic than any marital dialogue.Seeing Almodóvar's latest film was one of the most pleasurable cinema experiences I have had for some time. He has over the years amassed the technical skill and maturity to put across quite complex stories in a deceptively simple language. From the shock tactics and punk aesthetics of Pepi, Luci, Bom, y otras chicas del montón (1980), to the Oscar-winning melodrama of All About My Mother (1999), he had already come a long way. Here, finally, was an interweaving of the lives of disparate characters that was not only unabashed in its excess (it always had been), it actually made you care ? deeply.More bullfightingAt first sight Hable con ella looks like being another case study in that famously offbeat, not to say queer, book of life according to Pedro. Almodóvar's scenarios have been no strangers to sex, drugs, and heartrending canción (a particular brand of overwrought singing which knows no real Anglo-Saxon equivalent). In Hable con ella we have bullfighting, a theme he used as an excuse for kinky sex in Matador, given a contemporary treatment in the person of 'torera', Lydia (female bullfighters are indeed beginning to compete in a man's profession). Here too we have the apparently off-the-wall and by now notorious scene from the film-within-the-film, El Amante Minguante, in which a shrunken hero takes refuge in his lover's vagina for protection. But neither is gratuitous gesture: Lydia is designed to counterpoint Marco's almost feminine sensitivity, and the latter sequence, far from being there to shock, is a metaphor to spare us a far more harrowing, and morally problematic, plot truth. The ability to turn kitsch into art is increasingly one of Almodóvar's defining features.Post-modern?While he often refers to other artforms in his films (reality TV in Kika, Ruth Rendell in Live Flesh, canción in High Heels), since All About My Mother the technique has become more assured. Where that film was a paean to female suffering, via All About Eve and A Streetcar Named Desire, in Hable con ella we have two men sharing a tear over a performance by the dancer Pina Bausch. Other references are the Brazilian singer Caetano Veloso, who sings at a party attended by (uncredited) Cecilia Roth and Marisa Paredes (from Mother), and Michael Cunningham, whose novel The Hours similarly has a tripartite structure where each section deepens and sheds light on the others ('tunnels in caves'). In other words the post-modernist borrowing is rendered invisible by being absorbed into the drama: it is not post-modern any more.Almodóvar's choice to make a film about the loneliness and longing of men is a courageous one for a very private celebrity, a gamble to follow what might have been the peak of his career, and one which whets our appetite for what is to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few filmmakers who can tell such a beautiful and sad story as Almodovar does here. And only he can create such a surreal world that pulls us in and shows us the beauty and subjectiveness of love. He has proved just how much a master he has become in the total craft of film-making. The writer has created characters that touch us and seem immensely rich although we see and hear so little; and the director has managed, through the use of color, production design and lighting, to craft their world in such a way as we see what they see and therefore through their relationships, see who they are. The sensual nature of the film and Almodovar's ability to play with the beauty of the body and the strange intimacy of the characters work to perfection. This will be considered one of the great films of this era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film about men and their emotions. One man has a relationship with a woman, the most famous female matador in Spain. He cries over the most strange things. The female matador gets in a coma. The other man is in love with a woman, he has only spoken to her once. The man is a male nurse and when the woman gets in a coma he is the one to take care of her. Some people around him thinks he is gay so he is allowed to take care of her, see her naked, touch her. The two men get to know each other while waiting at the beds of their loved ones.I will not reveal what happens with the two women, or with the men. The way the subject is handled is great. In one way we see the two man devoting their lives two women. In another way we see the creepy part of that. For example we know the male nurse is in love with the one he is taking care of, and as I said, he sees naked every day. The woman seems to be an obsession, the man seems to be obsessed. We have sympathy for the men anyway.The acting is good, a very intelligent story and a great direction makes this film one of the year's best. In the end you will have a strange feeling, and a good feeling as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful piece of work?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of being driven to the top rank of art cinema directors with his critically acclaimed sensation "About My Mother," and being unlike other directors of equivalent status who have been chosen to work within the rootless world of the international co-productions, Almodóvar has remained instilled in the rich culture of his native Spain? In "Talk to Her" the two main protagonists are men, unusually for Almodóvar, whose films have been notable for a succession of powerful and striking female roles? Benigno is a male nurse who is employed to care for a dancer (Alicia) in a coma after a car accident? At the private clinic he meets Marco, a journalist who is in love with Lydia, a female bullfighter also in a coma after being gored by a bull? They become friends and Benigno persuades Marco that he must talk to Lydia, even if she cannot hear (therefore the title). But then we lean that the likable and amiable Benigno has raped Alicia, the woman who is in love with her? European art cinema has a great tradition but an uncertain future in the world increasingly dominated by Hollywood? Almodóvar is an ornament of European culture which proved that the form still has much to say about the human condition and can say it with charm, elegance, and attractiveness?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning, both visually and semantically</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On watching "Talk To Her", one of the first things you will notice is the beauty of film-work involved. The colours are rich and saturated, the image is crisp and the camera work is superb. Smooth panning shots and steady zooms guide you safely though s slightly fractured narrative, cutting between the past, present and future on occasions.This discontinuity, however, isn't confusing to the viewer and is, in fact, far from it. The cast act and speak so clearly that it is a perfect introduction to anyone new to foreign language film and, aside from the minor plot-line of bullfighting, there aren't an abundance of Spanish cultural references.This film, essentially, is a complex story laid out in an extremely simple form. It is not a film you will forget and, no doubt, will think about a lot after watching it. Also, unlike a lot of critically acclaimed films, you will not be cogitating over the events that took place in the film, you will be asking yourself how they apply to your life and relationships with others. Despite "Talk To Her"'s tragic story, it is an incredibly fun film to watch and discuss with others and a film I am extremely glad I added to my collection, having heard little about it at the time I bought it. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TALK TO HER (2002) **** Javier Camara, Dario Grandinetti, Leonor Watling, Rosario Flores, Mariola Fuentes, Geraldine Chaplin. Filmmaker Pedro Almodovar once again creates a cinematic masterpiece in his ongoing quest to bring together the war of the sexes as a harmonic convergence this time in a somewhat surreal matter involving a male nurse (Camara) and a tough yet sensitive journalist (Grandinetti) who form a unique friendship when his girlfriend, a bullfighter (Flores), is gored and sent into a coma landing her in the hospital where Camara is taking care of his ?beloved' (Watling), a dancer, who he has fallen in love with her when he (in a sense) was stalking her. Love, sex, desire and social ills fall into one heady mix of melodrama, soap opera fodder and a sprinkling of comedy as well as a memorable foray into silent cinema with `The Shrinking Lover' (think of an NC-17 version of `The Incredible Shrinking Man') that actually serves as a Greek chorus as to the happenings occurring. Controversial, bold and audacious in its execution yet ultimately haunting, harrowing and altogether human (and humane). One of the year's best films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almodovar at his Most Serious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an interesting feel in Pedro Almodovar's HABLE CON ELLA. The film starts and finishes in a theatre, and two characters who eventually meet and create a bond are sitting in close proximity of each other, moved by the drama playing itself on-stage. Javier Camera and Dario Grandinetti play Benigno and Marco. As TALK TO HER begins, they are both watching a play about two women, both mimicking each other's actions, both looking disheveled and with white night gowns. What neither of them know is that they will meet through the most unlikely of ways.Javier is a loner, a man who lost his mother and has an ambiguous sexuality, who works as a nurse in a hospital. He spies at Alicia, a young dancer (played by Leonor Watling), and we see his desire. He bumps into her on the street, walks her home, and notices her father is a psychiatrist who consults from home. So he sets a session in which he sort of declares he is a homosexual, while Alicia takes a shower. Before he leaves he takes an object from her room, not before he bumps into a naked Alicia and makes up a flimsy excuse as to why he is there. However, he will lose her to an accident which will leave her in a coma.Marco is a reporter assigned to interview the famous bullfighter Lydia (Rosario Flores) right at the moment she is going through some tough moments since her ex-boyfriend, another toreador called "El Nino de Valencia" (Adolfo Fernandez) has left her the object of media fodder. They become close, but a fateful match with a bull leaves Lydia also in a coma, hovering between life and death in the hospital where Benigno works and takes care of the also comatose Alicia. Marco, while taking care of Lydia, wonders if his interview could have broken her concentration and led to her situation.It's here when Benigno and Marco meet, and their meeting becomes the fulcrum of HABLE CON ELLA. Benigno opens Marco to the idea that love needs not have a response to be true -- he confides his love for Alicia -- and one sequence is truly disturbing: Benigno's fantasy sequence in which a shrinking man penetrates his wife's vagina, shown in black and white, betrays what can amount to a pathology, and its eventual denouement, something I won't reveal, creates a series of events that accelerate both the moral of the story. Love sometimes can create actions we would deem as monstrous, even when we may not see them as such. Almodovar handles his risky material with incredible taste -- it is rare to see this kind of subject matter on screen -- but Almmodovar makes it seem natural even when at its core, such love can be frightening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hable con Benigno, Es Loco</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert! I've read many of the comments on Hable con Ella, and agree with a lot of them, but am slightly disturbed by what is left out. Almodovar has created a very compelling movie that provokes many reactions in many people.However, Benigno seems to me to be a very pitiable, and yet disturbing character. He has nursed his mother for 20 years without any semblance of a normal life or interaction with other women. He then spies on someone across the street and follows her home. He finds out that her father is a shrink and goes along to see him for the chance to see her (little realising that the Doctor's concerns for his fragile mental development are well founded), and when he gets in he steals something from her room and surprises her naked. This I felt was very disturbing behaviour, and the fact that he then nurses her and washes her for months/years does not seem kindly to me but that it is the only way he can have a relationship with her. One that she would never condone based on his previous behaviour. He then loves her so much that he wants to marry her and rapes her whilst she is in a coma (portrayed by the B/w clip). Then gets sent to jail and commits suicide after finding out that his "lovechild" didn't survive. I can't understand why people are so moved by this film as I always felt that the male characters were ultimately unlikeable, if pitiable. Why does the uncommunicative reporter become such good friends with Benigno? Maybe because he is also very repressed as can be seen with his lack of reaction over finding out that the bullfighter was cheating on him, and his unwillingness to move on from his previous relationship.An interesting movie, but one that should be discussed rather than raved about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When silence become eloquence and words medicines...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Hable con ella' aka 'Talk to Her' (2002) is a powerful cinematic experience?It is not the best Almodovar and the narration is not a pristine one as more affective details could have been added. Yet the movie succeeds on so many levels. Why is that so? An original scenario and a bunch of very good actors might very well be the answer. Very baroque at time, adept of kitsch atmospheres Mr. Almodovar also has a cinematic sense of parody as well as drama. His style became famous out of Spain with movie like 'Women on the verge of a Nervous Breakdown' (1988), High Heels (1991) and Kika (1993). 'Talk to her' is no exception. It is baroque in the topic, kitsch in the atmosphere and dramatic in the output. The movie not only talks about friendship between two men but also about loneliness and wounds provoked by passion. It demonstrates how monologue can become dialogue and how silence is in fact 'eloquence of the body'. In between those silences, Benigno Martin (Javier Camera) and soon Marco Zuluaga (Dario Grandinetti) use words as weapons: weapons against Solitude first, against Death and against Madness?Yes Madness is another theme in this movie but not the 'dark madness', not the 'killing madness', but the type that is so close to tenderness and common sense that it becomes almost normality and that's exactly where Mr. Almodovar succeeds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean I have never seen a movie with such a subject...it is about love but in a very, very strange way, let's say that it is a story about love in a very honest way but in a "weird", but also pure situation!SPOILERS*****Seriously this is a movie about honesty, confidence and love. A man is just in love(he IS NOT obsessed) with a woman that is in a coma, he meets another man that had a girlfriend who is also in a coma and teaches him about how to treat people in an indirect way...This man in love with a practically dead woman is called Benigno and his loves goes to the top he is constantly talking to her, arranging her, he is her nurse and he also cleans her during all those years she was "dead". But one night his love goes too far, 1.He wants to marry the woman(Alicia) 2.He actually leaves her pregnant while being half dead. The situation causes commotion, Beningno is looked at like a Perve and in some way he just didn't really see the world's REALITY of the situation but,on the other hand, he sees his own truth which is that he was just in love with her and had no intentions of harming her. Love goes beyond the usual, REAL love always does, because love and madness are two feelings that always go together.As the movie ends you see Benigno in prison hurted for what he has done to Alicia, worried about his child and worried about any harm he could have done to her either she woke up or not. At the end we discover Alicia alive again, walking, not able to dance ballet like she used to before the coma but enchanting as always and you are able to realize everything beautiful Benigno ever saw in her.I won't tell the whole story there is much more going on in the film...but it is marvelous!10/10...You have never and you are not very likely to ever see a film like THIS ONE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talk to Her spoke to me..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The camaraderie of two men caring for women they love in comas is the center of Almodóvar's stunningly poignant film, Talk to Her. After recently viewing Almodóvar's stupendous film All about my Mother, I was anxious to see his subsequent work. While the films stories are unrelated the curtains that fall in the end of All about my Mother are present in the opening scene of Talk to Her; something audiences may not pay mind to if not watching in sequence. The film is filled with art; ballet is woven throughout and in the opening and ending scene. The Mise-en-sc?ne is breathtaking, from intricate matador costumes, to the vivid colors, and a haunting somber score. Reminiscent of Almodóvar style the film ranges from a soap opera to immense tragedy. There is the highly melodramatic scene in which the women matador character fights with a talk show host, yet overall the film has a solemn premise. We see surrealism in a silent film within the film's peculiar sexual symbolism later ensuing in rape. The film captures Spain's time honored masculine Bullfight, yet there is a woman matador; stretching the mind's eye in regard to gender roles; aptly Almodóvar's grand craft. Almodóvar is also known for female cast compilations, yet the director changes course with the two men who share loneliness and pain provoked by passion. We see attributes in the male characters generally deemed feminine, namely: embroidery, crying, nurturing devoting. The bond that in the end unites the two men is that they share these abilities. There are numerous flashbacks which show how the men meet their now comatose women and the evolution of the relationships. The title of the film, Talk to Her reflects a literal meaning as well as broader premise of communication in relationships. "Nothing is simple" says the ballet instructor in the last line of the film, a comment on the complicated emotional paradigm of the story. Almodóvar's script is original and captivating, great acting with daring direction, the viewer is indubitably moved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Manifold Fluidity of the Dance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.When a film's reason for being is to build layers, the opening shot must be a promise, an anchor in the shifting seas of perspective and a springboard for the narrative. In twenty seconds, I knew that this time Almodovar had spent more time on structure and less chasing intuitive sprites because of that opening shot. It is beautiful intelligent and rich, as many moments here are.Life as a ballet, a bullfight, a film, a song, a mentored trip, a lesson, a therapy session, a killing of the snake, and care of the comatose - each of these referring to all and any of the others, most explicitly. The amazing thing to me is that nearly all these layers are developed lushly and without irony as if they each were the root, the generator, of the others. You probably already know this, as it is pretty obvious.What's more subtle is the relationship to other films in what is becoming a genre: poetic, sexually-motivated, magically cocreated Spanish self-reference. Almodovar seems generous in his appreciation of films by others; after all having referenced layers that stop at the edge of a film is pretty arbitrary. I suppose there are many such leaps but the one I appreciated was to `Sex and Lucia' which I think is the absolute best of this genre. Elena Anaya was the uber-Alice-in-Wonderland in that adventure featuring three `Alices.' Here, she is the hallucinogenic, angelic third of the three sisters, each of whom will be loved by Marco. As with all such Alice-trios, the question is who is dreaming the story. That it could be a character from another, similarly-structured film is especially delicious.Many reviews note that Benigno is a virgin. Why would this be more trusted information than anything else; why wouldn't he have had two decades of sexual commitment to his mother? And why would we assume the baby is dead?Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, original, thought-provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another great movie by Pedro Almodovar, that's all I've got to say. It's interesting to see here how he wants to open up traditional gender roles without making his male characters sissies or drag queens (or his female characters butch cliché lesbians). There is some effort to erase gay stereotypes, too, interestingly without using a gay character. The dance scenes are wonderful and give the movie an air of vibrant, sophisticated artistry. Of course, what Benigno does seems wrong, but its interesting that the movie doesn't judge him and seriously considers his arguments, and in the end it is he who can awaken the girl.Acting is great overall, I especially liked Geraldine Chaplin because she is such an interesting person and actress. She actually looks Spanish, too! The silent movie made some people gasp in the audience, and I was baffled by it, too. But, it isn't obscene or pornographic, so if American audiences are shocked by it (which I guess they are), I think that's rather due to their ambiguous and troubled relationship with sexual things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>moving, morally emotive, a fantastic concept, truly remarkable, individual film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***MANY MANY SPOILERS*** Like many people when I watched this film I was left with a very unsettling feeling.Normally (especially in my case) when you choose to watch a film you pick something that's emotive, and will leave you with a desired feeling. Whether you choose to watch a film that will leave you sad, laughing, or frightened to death etc. But with this film it left me more questioning my moral perceptions, I felt like my conscience had been troubled. Day's later I was still thinking back on it, trying to come to grips with the concluding sensation I was left with.Writer-Director Pedro Almodovar Is fantastic at making the viewer emotionally attached to his characters. I found this when watching all about my mother. You become part of their lives, although the situations in his films are so obscure, you still feel like you can understand or relate with how they are feeling. And I felt he once again mastered that in talk to her. As the relationship between the two men grew, so did the viewers. Both men were trying to cope with feelings of unobtainable love, and it was very moving to watch how each perceived the situation and dealt with it. To begin with I was a little weary of Camera (the male nurse) you were made aware very early on that his feelings for Watling (girl in the coma) were not just nurse and patient, so throughout the film your feeling a little uncomfortable with how he treats her, washing her, changing her, constantly talking with her. Then as the film develops you are show just how much he loves her, and you begin to feel empathy for him, though you know he has never know this girl until she was unconscious, so you are still left with these undertone feelings of discomfit.***BIG SPOILERS*** Then when you find out that he rapes the girl, your left feeling completely bemused by the whole situation. You know you should be feeling disgusted, sickened and angered by what he has done, but instead you just pity him, feel real empathy, compassion and just sorry for the whole situation. Because you know that what he did he did out of love for her, and he felt that those feelings were being reciprocated by her.This film really makes you meditate on how you perceive such extremely moral right and wrongs. Because humans commit such awfully shocking deeds all the time we tend to throw them all into the same category and don't take time to look at the individuals and their reasons behind their acts. You want Camera to be treated differently, you want him to be help you don't want him to be punished. And it's that feeling that will trouble you. Because in the end you have more sympathy for him than the girl because you grow a real relationship with him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated, but say you loved it to be in the "in-crowd."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am really sorry to say this film is an example of an auteur's ego preempting fundamentals of good movie making, namely character and story development. The movie was interesting, yes, but that is about it. It is sad, but it appears that the hip appeal of the `modern `art' film has once again suckered in some critics into believing they will shunned by their artsy brethren should they say what they really know about this flick - overall, its average.Since everyone else has managed to discuss how great `Talk To Her' is, I feel obligated to herein enhance the negative. (sorry IMDB staff - I saw you loved it)The movie evoked little sympathy for either of its main characters. Another review I read points out that 'o great' Almodovar's `effortless way he engenders sympathy for them. I call b.s. here. I seriously doubt if anyone watching this movie care much about what happened to Benigno in the end. No one in my group did.Further, the relationship between Marco and Benigno is not at all convincing. We are not given a reason to think they should be friends other than the fact that the director tells us so. The relationship between Marco and Lydia is also poorly developed, if developed at all. One minute they are meeting and the next they are lovers. For the most part, the characters are one-dimensional, save a few contrived personality traits like ophidiophobia (fear of snakes).The plot hinges on Lydia's unusually extreme phobia of snakes, as well as several other ridiculously contrived coincidences, to come together. For example: Benigno has a crush on Alicia who happens to have an accident that puts her in a coma and then happens to be submitted to the hospital in the particular ward where Benigno just happens to work treating people with comas. Difficult to swallow this is at all a reflection of a possible scenario in life. It's like a sequence out of One Life to Live.I could go on, but to summarize this film is at best a string of interesting (some beautiful - Pina Bausch) scenes and not really worth investing more time in discussing. Nice ending, but the whole thing could have probably been done much better. Probably worth the rent and some couch time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie on my hotel TV in the middle of the Australian outback while on vacation. It completely drew me in, even when I had the TV on mute. I watched the entire movie without really feeling anything but I was entranced and intrigued by the visuals and the plot line and the backgrounds of the characters ...**SPOILER** So I would normally give it 6 out of 10, but then I learned that animals were actually truly harmed in the making of this film -- not something you hear about anymore, I think. (I wasn't too impressed either by the response of the production company when the film was protested: "we had permission to kill the bulls" and "the activists are just trying to get attention". Are we three-year-olds?) **SPOILER** The story was told so delicately in the film that I was surprised that Benigno's character actually was guilty of rape. I watched the whole conclusion of the film waiting to find out he was innocent and by the end I still wasn't convinced; it was only when I read the reviews that I realized that that really was the plot. The writing of this behavior for this character just didn't fit for me. It was completely not believable.**SPOILER** Those things bothered me a little but it was tolerable. I was ready to go to sleep when I read some other reviewers rationalizing the rape of Alicia: it was in the name of love; he really loved her; he believed she loved him back; she was there naked in front of him everyday.**SPOILER** Alicia was comatose. She could not speak or move. She had no voice, no say, in what she was experiencing. She couldn't tell Benigno if his breath smelled or if she liked his cologne; she couldn't tell him if she enjoyed his stories or if she found him self-obsessed and rambling; she couldn't tell him "I'm in love with you" or "I'm not ready to make love to you" or "Please put some clothes on me, you pervert!" As another reader said, one-sided love is not love. Benigno's love affair was a delusion that was fueled by the circumstance of coma, but that's no excuse for his behavior.I want to make sure that its romance is removed for everyone reading this review: **SPOILER MAJOR SPOILERS** Imagine that you are a woman waking up from a coma. You are told that a year of your life has passed. That you were in a car accident and have very little chance of dancing again, something that was your life's passion. You have been caressed and fondled and had your body trespassed upon in innumerable ways, without your knowledge or permission, in the name of good medical care. You have been pregnant, in fact you have given birth, by a man who you did not love, someone who revolted and frightened you. This stuff is not romantic, it's rape.So, now then, I'm going to submit this for review. Good night folks. I wish you all some wonderful movie-viewing in your future, and hopefully no more movies that paint rape in beautiful colors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love can come in many forms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Habla con Ella (Talk to Her) is a film about love, but is not your typical love story by any means. Like many other Almodovar films, it sounds very unusual when described in a paragraph, but it is less unusual and more genuinely moving when one immerses oneself in its world. The film deals primarily with the friendship between two men, Benigno and Marco. Benigno is a lonely nurse/caregiver for a beautiful comatose girl. Marco, is a strong but sensitive writer whose girlfriend, a female bullfighter, gets gored and also becomes comatose. A friendship develops between the two men, and the title refers to Benigno's advice to Marco, 'Talk to her'. Benigno's love for Alicia is full and real, and he treats her as if she is not in a coma, but Marco is a realist that can't seem to feel that Lydia is anything but dead. The film explores the idea of what love is, and that it not only consists of romantic love, but the love of people for each other - the caring and friendship between people even when things are at their worst. Marco cares for Benigno as his friend, even when things are at their worst, and it is his love for Benigno - a wounded, sensitive, and needy human being, that gives this film its soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My verdict: excellent film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally came across this Pedro Almodóvar film when I recently purchased a DVD set featuring three Almodóvar films - `All About My Mother', `Live Flesh' and `Talk To Her'. Before this, I had only really briefly heard of `Talk To Her' - I recall it winning an award (or two) at the BAFTA's, but I didn't know a lot at all about it and had no reason to want to see it.However, I am now extremely glad that I made the decision to buy this particular DVD set - because for me, `Talk To Her' was the best film in it, and it has now become one of my favourite films. As I'm sure we all know, `Talk To Her' is a story focusing largely on two female comatose patients. Alicia is a pretty young woman who was a dancer, before an accident caused her coma four years earlier. She is cared for by a dedicated nurse called Benigno (as we learn in the film, Alicia used to attend a dancing academy across the street from Benigno's house, and it is implied that he had some sort of infatuation with her before he cared for her in the hospital). The other comatose woman, Lydia, was a female bullfighter whose coma was the result of severe injuries acquired during a failed bullfight. Before she was struck down by the coma, Lydia was romantically involved with a handsome author/journalist named Marco, who struggles with Lydia becoming ill, and finds it difficult to cope with. Alicia and Lydia are in the same hospital, and it turns out that Benigno and Marco had actually previously met - during a theatre performance where they were sitting next to each other. As it says on the blurb of the DVD box, this is an `affirming story of two tragic women and the men who love them'.There is a great deal to admire and enjoy in this film - it has an excellent cast, an excellent storyline, and of course - an excellent director. I found that when I was watching the film, I never really knew which direction the plot was heading in - and as a result of this, I was left feeling quite surprised with some of the events which occurred in the film. This was quite refreshing because I find a lot of films to be very predictable, but `Talk To Her' isn't like that.From start to finish, `Talk To Her' is very captivating - helped greatly by the central four characters, Benigno Martín (Javier Cámara), Alicia Roncero (Leonor Watling), Marco Zuluaga (Darío Grandinetti) and Lydia González (Rosario Flores), all of whom are greatly interesting, even though there seemingly isn't much room for a great deal of character development within this film. I say this because we don't really seem to know/learn a lot about the characters, especially Alicia and Lydia, but they prove to be very interesting and intriguing characters nonetheless. Benigno, who we know more about, is a highly interesting character. Although, throughout the film, I never quite knew what to think of him. I wasn't sure if he was an innocent, sweet character or if there was really something more cold, calculating and sinister about him. But to me this made watching this character in the film much more interesting. I should also mention another important character - Alicia's dance teacher Katerina, played by Geraldine Chaplin. I loved this character; even though we see little of her in the film. Chaplin shines in this short but powerful role.One part of the film which has been greatly discussed and a part I loved was the silent-movie sequence (entitled in the film `The Shrinking Lover'), which was a film within a film. It was an excellent creation of Almodóvar's - very clever, very enjoyable - a delight.The cast of `Talk To Her' is magnificent - Javier Cámara's performance as Benigno was superb. I also loved the performance of Leonor Watling (Alicia). Although we barely see Alicia active and speaking in this role, Watling made the character very intriguing for me. As I have said, I also loved Geraldine Chaplin in this film, and it would have been great to seen more of her character. Overall, the standard of the acting from the whole cast was excellent. I'm especially looking forward to seeing more of Javier Cámara and Leonor Watling in the future.Finally, I strongly recommend seeing `Talk To Her' - and purchasing it on either DVD or VHS - because you'll probably find yourself wanting to watch it more than once. The whole thing is just a joy to watch - it has an excellent plot (greatly written and interesting from start to finish), a brilliant cast of talented actors/actresses, the film looks and sounds great (its got a great soundtrack; great music), and it's got an excellent director in the shape of Pedro Almodóvar; this is a gem of a film and it sincerely deserves all the awards and good reviews that it has received. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing but beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my second Almodovar film, the first being "Todo sobre mi madre", which is among my favourites. Perhaps just like what Almodovar himself puts it in his 'self-interview', women tend to inspire him to write comedies, and men, tragedies -- this film is a disturbing tragedy. *SPOILER AHEAD** Alicia is a victim by our most typical moral standard, as she is 'raped'. I think, however, that Benigno is also a victim -- in the sense that his distorted, and thus perverted, perspective on love leads him to do something that is utterly immoral &amp; disgusting, again by our typical moral standard, which eventually destroys him.If I can only answer with a simple Yes or No, I would say NO, Benigno is NOT a rapist. The motive of his act is not to sexually conquer or assault Alicia (that's a necessary element that qualifies an act as rape, in my opinion). Rather, with his perverted view on love, he seems to think that this is something he can, let alone should, do to show his love to her. And he most likely thinks Alicia approves of it and even likes it (that's what Benigno always says throughout the film -- Alicia likes listening to his report of a ballet performance he's seen, she likes having Marco as a visitor, as Benigno assures Marco). If Benigno were aware that his act is immoral, he would not remain working there. He even thinks of marrying Alicia, because he thinks they will be a better couple than a lot of others.Nonetheless, what Benigno has done remains disturbing, and yes, disgusting. I still cried like a leaking water jug, though, as early as when Benigno and Marco are talking for the last time in prison -- the scene when both of them are sobbing is disturbingly upsetting.I can appreciate all the scenes throughout the film, except the very, very last scene, titled 'Marco y Alicia'. The implication that there is a possible future between these two characters is distasteful to me.The film is directed and filmed beautifully, but is further enhanced by the fascinating score. The scenes of the bullfights, especially the one in which Lydia is fighting against 6 bulls, are breathtakingly beautiful. Unlike "Todo sobre mi madre" (I even like Lola), I find it difficult to fall in love with any of the characters in this film, except Lydia.I would love to see the film again, but not in the near future -- need some time to recover from the disturbed emotion before I can see it again. But for those who has yet to see the film, I definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pedro Almodovar's Hable con ella (Talk to Her) will likely be one of the best film's I'll have seen from the director, if not the best so far out of (regrettably) only the handful so far. This is the kind of crazy, tragic masterpiece that good directors wish they could try for and just aren't able to totally accomplish, where dicey subject matter is handled with just the right amount of humanity to look on these people without a heap of manipulative judgment. This is a credit to Almodovar's actors, some of them he's worked with other times (the best being Javier Camera as Beningo, a supporting character who's at the part of the aching, disturbing heart of the film). But the film's success is also in how Almodovar does so much with style while sticking close to the essential parts of the story. Here it's in looking at two male friends, a journalist (Dario Grandinetti) who has a relationship with a female bullfighter who has her own trauma after getting into the arena. The other is Benigno, who as a male-nurse looks after an ex-dancer who's in a coma. The two become close as friends, even as Benigno gets into a situation that has him in way over his head with the, yes, woman in the coma. Some of the dramatic scenes are very well handled in tone, as all the actors make this the kind of connection that draws us into characters that could in lesser hands be almost akin to a soap opera. But there are surprisingly touching scenes amid some keenly subtler ones in the film with these characters that stick with you once it's over (towards the end after Benigno's met his fate between him and Marco is one such scene). The best scenes in the film, however, are those that are given completely to Almodovar's unique use of the camera, and his imagination, as well as combining a very alarming, challenging psychological viewpoint.The sequence with Beningo's daydream of a silent film, and a very peculiar way to get to know the intimate side of a woman is shown in such a wild, surreal way that it's on par with the insane miraculous nature of Bunuel. Scenes like this could steal the show if there wasn't a dramatic base to cover it. As it is, Almodovar's Oscar winning film has a side that is of the fantastic, but also that leaning to the realm of humanism like Renoir. You can't hate these people, ever, no matter how fragmented or torn apart or just plain wrong they might be. It's a uniquely small, identifiable world where it pops up again for me on lonely nights, wondering what it's like to be Beningo or the bullfighter. A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have followed Pedro's movies for the last ten years, `Talk to Her' is an over saturation of his original style where the extravaganza of mixture of feelings showed in the screen can not be transmitted to the viewers leaving a sensation of disturbance among them.He is not been creative. He is using the same drama over and over, when he releases a new movie many important aspects that have characterized his previous movie are re-used in the next movie, so his work becomes to be perceived as a mini series.Pedro is exploiting to the maximum the same theme and it is getting to the point that his movies have become a movie series. (The hospital drama, the lady from the first floor of the building (same actress to add more repetition), the same building, the receptionist lady)Pedro's movies were characterized to connect the music with the scens extremely well, to the point that they are tied together as one entity; in Talk to Her he was not able to accomplish it. The music was not a character like it has been before where Pieces of music are forever associated in our minds to a scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pedro Almodovar's latest film is a welcome change of pace. Instead of making a woman's picture, this is a film that sees the action through the eyes of grown up men.Benigno is a misfit. How can any hospital employs him to attend a coma patient, is beyond understanding. More so, when the patient is the beautiful and well endowed Alicia? Didn't anyone in management see that they were only courting trouble by letting him be in that ward.?Marco, on the other hand, is always crying. Any little thing sets him off. His relationship with Lydia, the lady bullfighter, is interrupted by the accident she suffers and that brings him and Benigno to the same hospital at the same time.Benigno is the one that brings the story to a happy conclusion by leaving in a tragic manner. That means no more tears for Marco, only happiness after having suffered so much throughout the film.The acting is very good. Javier Camara is incredible as Benigno. He has a deadpan face and he says the most incredible things with a straight face. Dario Grandinetti is also very effective as Marco although the crying at times get to be too much because it happens without reason apparent.Leonor Watling doesn't have much to say since she's in a coma most of the time. Rosario Flores makes a better impression as the bullfighter. She has a very expressive face. The film has an interesting look that's very easy to take and enjoy. This is a surprise as Mr. Almodovar chills out after his recent films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If this is love, I know love not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pedro Almodovar's "Talk to Her" is as suprisingly sweet as it is profoundly disturbing. It is an examination of the nature of love that attempts to challenge our idea of what love is by taking it to its very limits. The lead character is a typical sad sack; slightly disturbed, isolated and sexually inexperienced. He spends his days staring out of his window at a rapturously beautiful dancer, and tries to form a relationship with her by becoming a patient at her father's psychiatric practice. This eventually leads to disaster when he sneaks into her room to steal an item of hers and finds her just coming out of the shower. But the guy perseveres. After spending years looking after his mother (Who wasn't an invalid, she just didn't like moving very much) he gains a degree in nursing and works with camatose patients. To his joy, one of the camatose patients turns out to be the dancer, and so now he can spend all day expressing and demonstrating his love for her. At least, you could see it that way. Or you could see it as an innocent and helpless girl delivered into the hands of a sexual deviant stalker who now can manhandle her and fantacise about her in any way he pleases. I think you can guess by now where the film is heading, and when the ultimate act is committed, Almodovar presents it in such a way as to show the audience how it could be interpreted as an act of love and selflessness. We never see the act itself, only the man's interpretation of it, and the sequence is, suprisingly, quite funny and, in strange way, touching. But that does not alter the fact that Almodovar is attempting to make rape emotionally acceptable. The film makes this particularly clear by its ending, which, if you have been following this review, I am sure you could also guess. Call me a prude, but I have always felt that love that is only felt by one person is not truly love. True love is something that built by two people by constant attention and care. If I tell someone, "I love you" and she cannot say "I love you too," then I am only really in love with an illusion, not a person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made world cinema - but the "8.2" IMDB rating is not justified!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of two men in love with women that are in comas and how they deal with their personal tragedies.Pedro Almodovar makes interesting films that are different but not so very different that they alienate the (world) cinema audience. Through video, DVD, cable, satellite, etc., what is the mainstream and what is art-house is becoming blurred. Naturally this is a good thing. Returning to the subject in hand, I have to commend the director for his control and timing. The Madrid-based film maker is still learning and, this is his most mature visual piece. Sadly he still writes the scripts and his vision of taste doesn't have a natural censor - the word that Spaniards seem to hate more than any other.Coma patients are interestingly in they are in a state of neither being dead or alive. Although here there is "no hope" of a return to the living. Whether they can hear what is going on or understand anything is an open question. This film takes no stance other than the obvious "they might so why not give it a go." Hence the title.This is not a subject that I particularly want to see jokes being made about and the sense of voyeurism is not really praiseworthy either. The male nurse is controlled and dedicated (or so it seems!) and seen going about his everyday duties, but also childlike and (so he says in the film proper) a virgin. There is an atmosphere here, but too little solid information for my liking. I didn't learn enough about the primary male subjects to draw any firm conclusions and the primary females are reduced to puppets for the bulk of the film.The inclusion of dance numbers and a bizarre TV interviewer didn't take me anywhere or add anything to my understanding. The black and white sexy skit is strange and looks out of place - like Almodovar is trying to spice up the soup.Clearly many are getting drawn inside his work and the praise of so many critics (paid or otherwise) is notable, but I notice they all see something different which suggests that they are just using the movie to get across their own agendas. As you can do with fey movies like this that take chances and push the envelope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offbeat and sensitive melodrama about two men care for women in coma masterfully acted and directed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good film including interesting drama , colorful cinematography , sensitive score and nice interpretations by all-Spanish-star-cast . Almodovar successful melodrama about two comatose women and the men who love them , including his ordinary rare characters , twisted situations and eccentric events . Two men Benigno (Javier Camera ,this role is based on Pedro Almodóvar's close friend Roberto Benigni) , and Marco (Dario Grandinetti) share an odd friendship while they care for two women , Alicia (Leonor Watling) and Lydia (Rosario Flores) in very different ways , who are both in deep comas .Agreeable film full of feeling , outlandish characters full of desire and love , haunting mood-pieces , unforgettable as well as outrageous images , and sense of style . The picture deals with off-the-wall/intense drama , loneliness familiar absurdities , superb scenes , a haunting meditation on love with dysfunctional roles and many other things . Here deals with existences of the four peculiar roles : a nurse , a ballerina , a writer , and a bullfighter , whose fates will flow in all directions, past , present and future , dragging all of them towards an unsuspected finale . A silent segment , played by Paz Vega and Fele Martinez , is awesome with shocking as well as funny images . This strange as well as excessive melodrama could only have been made by Almodovar . The picture is pretty well and turns out to be superior to Almodovar's previous entries such as or ¨Live flesh¨ , ¨The flower of my secret¨ , ¨Kika¨ , ¨High heels¨ , ¨Atame¨ and ¨Entre Tinieblas¨, all of them strong and outlandish dramas . The result is undiluted scabrous flick , plenty of crazy strings of plots and sharp images with enjoyable situations . I liked everyone in the excellent cast, and the male and female actors , especially Leonor Watling , were all very attractive . Furthermore , a notorious support cast such as Lola Due?as , Roberto Álvarez , Elena Anaya , Chus Lampreave , Adolfo Fernández , Ana Fernández , Jose Sancho , Carmen Machi , Loles León , Fele Martínez and other delightfully played roles . In addition , spectacular dancing carried out by Pina Bausch and her professional dancer group . And a lot of cameos : Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes: frequent Pedro Almodóvar actors appear briefly when Caetano Veloso is singing . As usual in most of Pedro Almodóvar's movies, there is a small role for Agustín Almodóvar, his brother and producer of the film, who plays the priest conducting the wedding is the producer of the film . Rousing musical score by Alberto Iglesias , Almodovar's ordinary ; including some marvelous songs . Colorful and luxurious cinematography in Panavision , beautifully photographed by Javier Aguirresarove . This one-of-a-kind picture was realized in his peculiar style by Pedro Almodovar ; he often uses symbolism and metaphorical techniques to portray circular story lines though here he directs a special melodrama , including his ordinary touches . He won an Academy Award for Best Original screen-play and it was chosen by "Les Cahiers du cinéma" as one of the 10 best pictures of 2002 .

		<fullReview>Two men share an odd friendship while they care for two women who are both in deep comas.Pedro Almodovar has consistently made good films. This may not be his very best, or perhaps not even his second best, but with all his films being top-notch it still remains worth seeing.Where else can you see a film with the emotion of hope in the face of a woman with PVS? Americans today (2015) still remember Terri Schiavo and the torment it takes for a family to wait or pull the plug.As a bonus, we also get some very inventive silent film-style intertitles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talk to her is a film that does not fall under ordinary. Beautifully written, directed and acted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film does not need recommendations. It is such a pure form of art that is worthy of viewing. I am hugely fond of Spanish films, as they come out with mere unanticipated twists and emotions so different form the world we live in. This film carries on the trend. It is a slow- medium paced film, which penetrates the human mind to consider or reconsider many aspects of the society. A story, so original. Characters, so plain and simple, and yet so well played by each of them. Since, I myself do not like spoilers, I am not going to get in to any revealing details. But, in the middle of the film an abrupt song, which will give you goose-bumps and enthrall you. Small details so well maintained in the film, that makes it a master piece. Please watch it, if you are a fan of rarity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally textured drama with moral ambiguity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almodóvar has again proved his uniquely talented capacity to deliver an emotionally textured and morally ambiguous drama. What superficially appears to be a story of two men's shared experience of caring for the comatose women they love, reveals to be as much ? if not more ? about the relationship that develops between the two male protagonists, Marco and Benigno. Their differences draw them together and offer them the opportunity for understanding and human connection unlike what either has experienced in a romantic context. Talk to Her challenges our conceptions of intimacy, questions our associations of femininity, and examines our reactions to love and loss. Marco, a sensitive but disconnected travel writer, is paralyzed with hopelessness after a bull gorging leaves his matador lover, Lydia in a coma. Benigno, an obsessively loyal and socially stunted nurse, has dedicated four years of round-the-clock care to Alicia, a woman who has not (and now cannot)requite his affections. Marco is physically present in Lydia's room,but he cannot connect. He confides in Benigno: "I can't even touch her?I feel so despicable." Benigno behavior toward Alicia is so far on the other end of the spectrum that it culminates in a morally deplorable action. He feels his love for Alicia is enough to sustain their "relationship," even stating that they "get along better than most married couples." A logical unfolding of the story from this point might have assumed that Marco would emerge as the moral hero, helping Benigno understand the errors of his mentality and saving him from a life of irrational and criminal obsession. Oh, but Almodóvar would never let us off so simply. Benigno is the unconventional hero who teaches Marco that the root of love is in the ability to communicate.What both men find in their friendship with each other is a reciprocal intimacy that neither one has experienced with the women they love. Loneliness is their shared adversary. Instead of harping on Benigno's skewed morality and social ineptitude, Marco sees the beauty of loyalty and confidence of character exhibited by his new friend. Through the glass wall at the prison, Benigno, destitute and forsaken, desires simply the physical contact of a hug from the only person who has not abandoned him. Both men express traits typically associated as feminine ? care-giving, grieving, longing for intimacy, crying over loss as well as beauty. Yet, even when their sexual orientation is explicitly questioned, neither feels compelled to defend their masculinity or correct the assumption. With consistency, Almodóvar continues to challenge gender roles and social norms. Talk to Her is framed in circularity as it begins and ends with segments from two different live ballets. The characters' presence and reactions as member of the audience serve as a vehicle to fill in deeply layered emotion without the use of dialogue or explanation. Almodóvar also utilizes this technique in the middle of the film with a creative homage to the avant-garde silent melodramas of the 1920s. As Benigno tells Alicia,"The Shrinking Man" is about a doomed lover so devoted that he sacrifices himself to be part of his mistress forever. This break in the narrative actually serves to pull the audience deeper into Benigno's psyche while also symbolizing the action of insemination. By not filming the sexual act itself, Almodóvar pushes the moral ambiguity of the case and avoids casting Benigno strictly as a rapist. The theme of the film is not about answering whether or not Benigno is a "bad guy." The presentation of the moral dilemma intentionally blurs the lines and forces the audience to see Benigno as a person beyond his actions. The task of creating such emotionally complex characters that can successfully draw surprising sympathy from viewers warrants tremendous praise. While Talk to Her may be considered a bit of a walk on the main-stream side for such an experimental counterculture director, Almodóvar has succeeded in challenging a more traditional audience to connect with emotional intellect to non- traditional cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almodovar Delivers Another Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talk to Her is a Spanish comedy-drama film starring Javier Cámara, Darío Grandinetti, Leonor Watling, Geraldine Chaplin, and Rosario Flores. The film's themes include the difficulty of communication between the sexes, loneliness and intimacy, and the persistence of love beyond loss.It was written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar.Benigno is a male nurse whose apartment overlooks a dance studio run by Katerina; he often sits on his balcony and watches one of Katerina's students, Alicia, and he finds himself becoming infatuated with her. When Alicia is severely injured in an auto accident that leaves her in a coma, Benigno discovers she has been admitted to the hospital where he works, and he spends his days caring for a woman he now deeply loves but has barely met. Marco is a journalist who was assigned to interview Lydia, a well-known female bullfighter whose on-the-rocks romance with another toreador, "El Ni?o de Valencia", has made her the focus of the tabloid press. During Marco's interview with Lydia, he goes out of his way to treat her kindly, and she appears to return his attention. During the bullfight which follows, Lydia is gored by the bull, and is now in a coma; Marco is certain his interview broke her steely concentration, and he spends most of his days at the hospital, convinced her injuries are his fault. Alicia and Lydia are both housed in the same ward of the same hospital, and in time Benigno and Marco become close friends, bonding in their shared devotion to women who cannot return their affection.The film combines sensuality, spirituality and sheer joy in storytelling in marvelously harmonious proportions.Very few directors could get away with making a film like this, but Almodovar not only gets away with it, he delivers a masterpiece.This will surely give pleasure to the viewer for he delivers another masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never see such a melancholy note of love in a movie. "Talk To Her", is like a song of a Nightingale.Tears in my dreams, love in my eyes and sadness in my heart. Thank you Pedro Almodóvar for gifting such a celebrated direction. Javier Cámar as Benigno Martín and Darío Grandinetti as Marco Zuluaga are some unforgettable characters. The opera that begins the movie with two women running inside the wooden chairs are very meaningful to continue the story. Finally the last opera defines the word "love". The rains symbolize the sadness and loneliness in love. The character of Benigno draws many lines in my mind. He is the sinner and the saint. He is a true lover. He raped Alicia to give her a new life. At the end he sacrifices himself to conquer his "love".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almodovar beautifully explores love with unique and odd specimens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pedro Almodovar's "Hable Con Ella" is a great film but one that's hard to diagnose. Foremost it's a love story, one that explores unreciprocated love in the sense that two women are in a coma and the film is about the men who love them. But it also explores that idea more figuratively because the characters are afraid to speak to each other when it comes to sharing expressions, thoughts or memories of deep love and emotion. Sometimes Almodovar's exploration is a bit unsettling, but that's part of what makes it a standout film and worthy of its Best Foreign Language Film Oscar."Hable" follows a few different characters. Marco (Dario Grandinetti) is a journalist who tries to land an interview with a famous woman bullfighter named Lydia (Rosario Flores) who captivates him and the two become somewhat involved before a bullfighting accident leaves Lydia in a coma. Benigno (Javier Camera) is a male nurse who takes care of Alicia (Leonor Watling) a young dancer in a coma, to whom he is deeply attached and in a slightly concerning way. We see the history of both those relationships, but it is that which develops between Marco and Benigno that is most interesting as they spend many days in the clinic together.The story takes us to many different points in time. We learn that Marco was having trouble getting over a past love when he met Lydia and they'd only discussed in hours before her accident. We also learn that Benigno was stalking Alicia before her accident and his nursing skills happened to put him in a fortunate position to be with her almost all the time. Sharing these stories and their passion for women who might never love them, the two form a bond.Almodovar's film is also big on art. Not only is Alicia a dancer, but the film opens and ends with the main characters attending a dance performance, there are bullfighting scenes (considered essentially to be an art form in Spain) and there is a peculiar silent film shown within the film. Different main characters cry when observing these events, mainly because they evoke in them an emotion they've yet to express, that they've bottled up inside.Though strange, the art in this film is pivotal. Almodovar seems to comment on how artistic moments, sometimes for the silliest of reasons, can provoke strong emotional responses. They communicate important ideas and emotions in a less explicit manner, acting almost as a substitute for direct communication between an artist and his or her audience.That's where the beauty of "Hable Con Ella" lies, although your attention will be focused on the peculiarity of these relationships and the strange ways in which Almodovar presents love and relationships to us -- plus of course how the events unfold. But it's really about communication as the title alludes to, how we use art among other things to wrap up a message that perhaps is best delivered directly, even if the other person might not understand, even if they cannot hear us at all.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talk to Her</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Spanish film from Oscar nominated director Pedro Almodóvar (All About My Mother) featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, a deserved honour. Basically Benigno Martín (Javier Cámara) and Marco Zuluaga (Darío Grandinetti) meet by chance at a theatre, and meet at the private clinic where Benigno works. Marco's girlfriend Lydia González (Rosario Flores), a professional bullfighter, is knocked into a long coma, and as it happens, Benigno is looking after another woman in a coma, young ballet student Alicia (Leonor Watling). While both women are in comatose, Benigno and Marco become good friends, and they are encouraged to talk to the women in hope that they can hear them and awaken. It is obvious that Benigno has a growing passion for Alicia, and he is arrested, accused of impregnating her, and this is not long after he suggested marrying her! Marco is obviously the only person who cares about Benigno's situation, and is willing to let him know what is going on with Alicia. In the end, Benigno sees no way out but to join Alicia in death, but he never lived to see her awaken, as Marco was shocked to see. Also starring Geraldine Chaplin as Katerina Bilova, Mariola Fuentes as Rosa and Pina Bausch as Bailarina 'Café Müller'. It is a very touching love story, all done with great performers, making you believe about how sometimes too much passion can give some false hope, and obviously it all ends in tragedy. Notable moments include the bullfighting sequence, some musical interludes, and the imaginative silent film included, The Diminishing Lover, where a shrunken man climbs into his love's vagina, and never comes out, an impressive romantic drama. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay for Almodóvar, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film not in the English Language and Best Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated and subtly layered film about love, obsession and friendship.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we have four characters: two men and two women. One man is articulate but weak. The other, child-like but determined. The first man will give up on the woman he loves, resulting in the end of her life. The second man will submit himself to his woman, effectively bringing her back from the dead. Almodovar will draw parallels between the four characters throughout, whilst commenting on the subtly charming sense of absurdity of the film through his references to other inter-textual ideas.The main story Talk to Her (2002) is framed by scenes of interpretive dance. In the opening scene, the dance depicts a blind woman at the mercy of her man, who scrambles about the stage moving chairs and tables to protect her from the danger that they represent. This scene becomes a story, which ends with a reference to overcoming your obstacles. By the end of the film, after a series of further symbolic narrative branches, the interpretive dance motif is resurrected. This time the woman is seen as a sort of idol; worshiped by the men who surround her. Needless to say, this is all representative and symbolic of the actual story at hand. Throughout the film, Almodovar will draw parallels between these branches - most of which dictate the way the 'real' story develops - as well as his four characters. For example, note how Marco (Darío Grandinetti) and Benigno (Javier Cámara) represent two halves of the same whole; both somewhat effeminate, both possessing what the other character lacks, physically and/or emotionally. It is also important to note the significance in how Almodovar has built and developed his characters and how they relate to the various aspects of the narrative discussed above.Here we have a largely Kubrickian device, with the lead as the writer. In A Clockwork Orange (1971), The Shinning (1980) and Full Metal Jacket (1987), Kubrick used the personification of the writer as the creator of his film. Almodovar does the same here. Marco is a writer, or more importantly, a critic. It is only because of his writing assignments that he finds himself involved with the film in the first place. Because of this, the entire film can be seen as subjective from Marco's point of view; the reason why we never see Benigno's mother for example, is because Marco never met her, etc.It is also important to note the professions of the female leads. Firstly: Alicia (Leonor Watling) the dancer, then secondly: Lydia (Rosario Flores) the bullfighter. Both are performers, and thus, become performers in Marco's story. However, the ultimate stroke of genius on the director's part is "film within a film" sequence, The Shrinking Lover. The relationship of this scene to the overall context of the film itself is to underline Benigno's true intent. However, what makes it so effective is Almodovar's use of layered symbolism and deft humour. Not only does this film within a film successfully convey what is happening in the scene that we should be seeing in the real-life sense, it also works as a critique (and more impressively, as a complete thematic reveal) of what has been happening in the film as a whole.The man becomes the woman, the woman gains strength, the man disappears. Here the director juggles the various layers of narrative, both real and surreal, perfectly; whilst also employing comedy and tragedy to great effect. Acting, photography and music is, as always, terrific; but it is the director's uncharacteristic subtlety and the fine performances from the four central characters that will leave you truly impressed.</fullReview>

[SPOILER WARNINGS] The singer at the summer party. The memory of the woman in Africa escaping the snake. Passion at the ballet. Powerful unrequited love. Deep friendship. In amongst these feelings and being mesmerised by turns, the whole is simply beautiful.The modern dance sequences underline beguiling music and we care, we really do care very much what happens to the people in the end. A sure sign of a good film. This was a film of images. The bullfight finery (I also hate the mindless cruelty of so-called bullfighting). The bullfighter taking on the bull, Benigno thrown into the world and landing on a different set of horns in form of the justice system. Two deaths but a birth of sorts - "Everything's not lost" in the words of Coldplay - Alicia emerges from the coma.I watched the last dance sequence three times on the DVD. then I went back to the song in the villa, fantastic. Simply delicious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been watching Pedro Almodovar films - all of them since 'El Ley del Deseo' - with a mixture of admiration and frustration. When would he forget that he is gay and concentrate on being a filmmaker?At last, it has happened, and what we get is pure platinum.The joy of this wonderful, wonderful film is in that most under-rated of cinematic concepts, characterisation. Benigno must be the finest piece of cinematic characterisation since Norman Bates. Just look at the way that, as nurse, he tends to the very smallest detail in looking after his beloved Alicia, and compare that with the scenes in which he acts as voyeur. This is a fully rounded character the like of which we are rarely privileged to encounter.Thematically too, this is a joy to behold. The relative destinies of Benigno and Alicia are perfectly conterpointed through the character of Marco and his own tragedy.And the structure? Well, the time structure of the film is one of the most creative in modern cinema that I can remember.This is, quite simply, the great masterpiece.Mike</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If for no other reason, I had to write this to bump down the silly review that called "Talk to Her" a waste of money.I won't describe the story, because many other reviewers already do. Instead, I will say that this film, unlike typical American films, remains in your mind for days after viewing it. I am pondering why. It isn't the plot that does it. I believe it is the fact that in "Talk to Her," as in many "foreign" films, you get to know the main characters very well. It isn't about huge surprises and things blowing up. It is about the evolution of, in this case, two men, and their tie to each other.Yes, there are a couple of minor surprises, but in the end, what you remember about "Talk to Me" are the fact that you have spent a couple of hours with four people and watched as their lives changed. I'm still thinking about them, and am glad I saw Talk to Her. I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having characters fall into a coma has long been a favoured plot device for the writers of soap operas, and were this film made earlier in his career you would expect director Pedro Aldovomar to layer on the kitsch stylings and hysterical trappings of the soap world. However Talk To Her is an exquisitely beautiful and original film that couldn't be further from the daytime world of shaky sets and improbable plots.The story revolves around two women who lie in coma and the men who care about them. One is a dancer who was hit by a car and is now passionately cared for by a male nurse who feel deeply and unrequitedly in love with her the week before her accident. The other is a bullfighter who was gored in the ring and is visited by both her current and former beaus.The film opens on an eerily dreamlike piece of modern dance and a mode of lightness and unreality can be felt throughout the whole piece. Aldovomar's use of bold blocks of colour in scenery and clothing creates a lush visual texture whilst the composition of the shots has a wondrous amount of detail without ever feeling cluttered or overcomplicated. Some may call the impassive framing of scenes Kubrickian in nature, but by this stage in his career it is fair to say that Aldovomar has a style all of his own.The film is difficult to break down into easily explicable elements to describe and praise. Instead it creates a mesmerizing mood that is never flippant but retains a playfulness within it's strong emotionally core. Talk To Her is a film that is too rich to be described adequately, it can only be viewed, appreciated and enthusiastically enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man From La Mancha (il miglior fabbro): Almodóvar is the new Quixote</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excuse my coming on line a bit late, but I just had to see this film a second time so as to clear up a few ideas. In the meantime I made the mistake of reading the commentaries already posted on IMDb (something which I generally only do after posting mine), as well as visiting a few web sites. Almodóvar's noisy storming of Spanish cinema should be divided into everything before `Todo Sobre Mi Madre'(qv), and everything after it. Clearly Almodóvar has come of age: he has matured into an astute perfectionist who can handle very different kinds of drama - serious drama. However, not lacking those exquisite humorous touches: on this point both `Todo Sobre Mi Madre' and `Hable con Ella' have a common characteristic. But only in reference to those underlying subtle and humorous touches: as for everything else the two films are as different as a pea and a plum.Almodóvar has that specific intelligence which enables him to write his own dramas, rather as if he were a playwrite about to venture into novels, as well as having a keen eye on the visual aspects he is going to put on the screen. He has an incomparable eye for those little details which in life one tends not to see: when Almodóvar shows you them on screen it is as if the poet has spoken to the blind man so that he too can see the beauty of a flower. Perhaps only Garci among Spanish directors is comparable in some of his films. This genial creativity goes beyond his superb story-line and identifiable soberful images to the characters themselves - and the actors he chooses. I mean, just look: he puts Lola (Rosario) Flores, Javier Cámara and Chus Lampreave into what is going to be an important film. Neither of these three can be said to have pulled off great performances anywhere. Flores, more known for her singing in poorly made TV shows, generally gets me twitching for the off button; Cámara and Lampreave are generally known for lighter even silly parts in comedy or TV series. But these three in `Hable con Ella', under the steady guiding hand of Maestro Almodóvar put in really excellent performances; I would even go beyond that: Javier Cámara, from nothing, has produced an interpretation which far outweighs any of your recent Oscar winners. Ably helped by a magnificent Darío Grandinetti, Argentinian actor who had not previously come to my knowledge, we have here two men in truly tremendous roles, worth seeing again ... And maybe again when this film comes out on video. Almodóvar makes it clear that first he does not need great famous names to make his films, and second he is not only a director of actresses: he has that magical touch which turns relatively small-time lesser-known actors into something bordering on greatness, and this time he has done it with men. Not many directors are capable of this.Surprisingly, the better known actors are in secondary roles: Leonor Watling is right; had hoped to see more of Elena Anaya after her part in `Lágrimas Negras'(qv), Loles León who usually leaves me tepid, and Fernando Guillén Cuervo. Added to that, uncredited in insignificant cameo parts are Cecilia Roth (please see her in `Martín (Hache)'(qv), and Marisa Paredes. Geraldine Chaplin is quite convincing as the ballet teacher.Then the music: you could enjoy this film blindfolded. Superb soundtrack; beautiful; exactly playing in with what is on screen; silent when it should be. Alberto Iglesias uses his own composition to extreme effect, wonderful orchestration, but blending into it the film uses tracks from Purcell and other Brazilian sources, crowned by the best interpretation I have ever heard of the oft badly-treated song "Cucurrucucú Paloma" sung so hauntingly but at the same time so tenderly by Caetano Veloso. A real treat: not surprising that Darío Grandinetti shed a little tear listening to it, so feelingly evocative it was. Truly a wondrous moment; unrepeatable.And with Javier Aguirresarobe doing the camera-work, good photography is guaranteed: he does not simply see what he is shooting, but feels it, captures the atmosphere.Such is the gift of the maestro who can plan a story and knows how to tell it; but at the same time interweaving so many sidelines, so many other little scenes and details intermingling into the main events with subtle touches .... the receptionist in the hospital, the prison funcionary who can't get it into her head to use the microphone to speak to visitors through a sound-proofed window: intelligent humorous touches.But it is the lead actors who carry this off so triumphantly - ney, that is not the word as triumphalism is absent from this film: Javier Cámara (?????Albelda de Iregua, La Rioja - joder: es un vecino!!!!!!!!) and Darío Grandinetti are simply superb.My vote is just a little higher than for `Todo Sobre mi Madre' - around 8.5/10. I shall see this one again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** When I went to see it in the theater I knew that there were very opposed reviews. Some said that Almodóvar had lost all his special touch of spontaneity and had become more - too - serious. Some others said Hable con ella was his best and mature film of his career.What I found was not one, neither the other. I found it was an interesting film. But not what I hoped. I felt that it was a very well-done film, but the plot wasn't complete. I loved the photography, the image of the film. It arrives to the senses, it is a great movie to watch, to listen. The music is great. It had to be, because the musical director was Alberto Iglesias, the one who also does the (moving) music of Medem films. The scene of Caetano Veloso was great and then there is the part of the dancing shows, also fantastic to see. It is a big injection of beauty. Yes, it is a film full of beauty, everywhere.What I disliked most was, as I've said before, the plot. Yesterday I read an interview who was done by Almodóvar and answered by himself -quite curious-. He explained where he took out the idea of the plot: he said few things that happened in real life.(*if you haven't seen the film, quit, otherwise you'll know the end*) - basically, the story is based in a piece of new he read about the story of a girl who was in a coma for a long time and she was violated by the male nurse. Then she woke up as a consequence of this. Then, their parents sent the nurse to prison but have always been grateful to him because he woke her up, and offered him the best lawyers. And in the film this is not explained, I think Almodóvar should have taken more profit about this. Because we can imagine she woke up after Benigno made love to her and made her react. But it is not said, and you don't know if she had opened her eyes after this or after a month just because of a stroke of luck. I suppose, anyway, if Almodóvar hasn't done it this way is because he find it is not necessary. I'm anyone to judge, I know.Oh, and I forgot to say that I really liked the short silent movie, it was very nice, poetic and curious. You see, all the details in the film are great, but fails the main plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Habla Con Ella</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Habla Con Ella is by far one of Almodovar's best films ever. The plot of the story is definitely something peculiar in its originality. This movie gives viewers another way of looking at foreign film as it definitely shows you the difference from a typical Hollywood movie. The two main characters not knowing who each other are almost meet while watching a dance performance. However they later meet at a hospital. One guy is a journalist whose girlfriend is a bullfighter and other is a caregiver for a beautiful dance student. The two men have one thing in common that bonds their friendship; the women they love are both in comas. The story flashes back and forth as we learn about the lives and shocking outcome. All of the actors do such an excellent job of acting that it makes the movie looks so natural. Almodovar gives you a glimpse of Spain in the movie as he catches bright colors, landscapes, and buildings that are so beautiful. He has a way of catching people's emotions that make any scene look very natural. Like in his other movies Almodovar isn't afraid to touch on issues that make people feel awkward but rather turns it into art cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply one of the best foreign films in a long time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie opens with a beautiful play. Two women dressed in night gowns are dancing around in an area filled with chairs. A man comes out and throws the chairs around to make room for these women to walk around freely. He's saddened, but we don't know why. These women seem almost too afraid to open their eyes, and too full of life to not move around even though there's so much in their way.This is a perfectly suitable opening for the movie. Two women, both seemingly lifeless, a man, saddened, helping them even though they don't know it. He gets a sort of satisfaction and escape from his troubled life by helping these needy women. And we know that even if these women had their eyes open, they would never be able to love this man for who he is. "Talk to Her" is so deep and thought-provoking that every second of the movie puts some sort of spell on you.Inside the theater, we meet Marco Zuluaga (Darío Grandinetti), an Argentenian who cries during the performance. He later meets a striking female bull-fighter and quickly jumps at the chance of writing an article about her. He follows her, helps her, keeps her company, all while suffering from his previous relationship. We then get introduced to Benigno Martín (Javier Cámara)who nurses a young woman in a coma. He explains that he's been doing it for over four years and has no desire to stop. After Marco's new love gets injured in a bull-fight and goes into a coma, she is placed in the room next to Benigno. The two men meet, comment about an encounter at the play, and in a series of flashbacks and flash-forwards, their stories get woven together in a strange twist of fate and destiny.Director-writer Pedro Almodóvar's double nomination for "Talk to Her" is undoubtedly deserving. As is his win for Best Original Screenplay. He fuses together such a magnificent story of friendship, betrayal, terror and love. Marco's story both touches us and inspires us, whereas Benigno's story sends shivers down our spine. But in the end, these two still befriend each other, and even after Benigno's disturbing pull at impregnating the comatose woman, we still sense some sort of connection between the two.A definite example of how European cinema is so important in modern life, and just how a complicated situation can turn even more complicated, "Talk to Her" is a gem in both storytelling, directing and acting. It's a movie that uses normal approaches to common situations and furthers that by going that extra mile. It shows just how far taking care of someone can go, and how people can be used even when most vulnerable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Men, Two Women, Two Comas---See a Pattern?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critiquing "Hable Con Ella" (translated "Talk to Her") is a difficult task. It is unlike anything in the mainstream I have ever seen. It definitely benefits from Oscar-nominated director/Oscar-winning screenwriter Pedro Almodovar, but this is one of those movies where you know you like it and you are not really sure you know why. In modern-day Spain a beautiful young woman (Leonor Watling) sits in a coma. She has a kind male nurse (Javier Camera) who looks after her, along with other hospital staff, but something about him is off. Enter female bullfighter Rosario Flores who falls in love with journalist Dario Grandinetti and a whirlwind love affair begins. But naturally bullfighting has its occupational hazards and unfortunately the law of average catches up to Flores. Now she is in a coma, a coma she may not wake from. Grandinetti is totally distraught and upset, as you might imagine, but finds comfort in nurse Camera. They start a friendship that is linked by, of all things, their love for women who are in comas. Camera actually knew Watling (a former ballet dancer) before her terrible car accident and developed a crush on her from afar and then finally met her with mixed results. The fact that Camera may have female-dependency issues (after nursing his late mother for many years before her death) and also may have homosexual tendencies only adds more layers to an already complex story mix. But through it all he continues to talk to Watling, in spite of her condition, in the hopes that someday she will indeed reawaken. Grandinetti tries to accept Camera's views with comatose patients in stride, but his faith is not near as strong in spiritual teachings, medical technology or even Flores. Geraldine Chaplin even makes a long appearance here as Watling's former dance instructor and Almodovar pays homage to the silent film era in the most unusual ways with a sequence that is too hard to talk about or explain (you will just have to see it for yourself and draw your own conclusions). "Talk to Her" works because of its two male leads and because of Almodovar's modern cinematic brilliance in his story-telling. Watling is a stunning beauty and her appearance in the film is something truly remarkable throughout. Flores is the weakest link in a strong chain. I just never had any connection to her character and honestly I felt like she was totally wrong for the venture (the part admittedly is a bit under-developed and bland to start with though). Overall "Talk to Her" is a very strong Spanish product that stands extremely high with the slightly better Mexican product "Y Tu Mama Tambien" (both films were released in 2002). Sometimes when talking does not work, just try talking some more. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Almodovar is portraying a common male fantasy by portraying a Benigno obsessed and in love with a beautiful comatose woman. She is beautiful, sexually yielding, and doesn't have a functioning brain. In a way, it is like the Stepford Wives, where women are merely sexually attractive robots that do not possess any real intellect or consciousness, and certainly not the ability to refuse sex.</fullReview>

Another thing I liked about this movie was the Black &amp; White part, made the old fashioned way like Charlie Chaplin films. The scene where we see the shrunken man crawling around his lover's body?..I think that scene captures all men's fantasy.

		<shortDescription>The last half of 'Talk To Her' is disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Talk To Her' tells the story of two men who meet and eventually befriend each other while caring for two comatose women. The first half of the film drags a bit, but the scenes between Benigno and Marco make it watchable. However, during the last half, the film disappoints. What started out as a film of beauty quickly sells out. Director Pedro Almodovar trades in what could have been a meaningful conclusion for a standard thriller plot twist. As a result, by the end of the film, I did not feel the same sympathy for Benigno's character as I once did. In effect, a lot of the beauty initially seen in the film quickly disappears. For this reason, 'Talk To Her' is a disappointment. (4/10)</fullReview>

But I was thoroughly disappointed at the end.From the very start the story seems weird. The passion of that nurse for the ballet girl was very unlikely. He was more of a fan than an actual lover. The characters were not really interesting and I didn't get envolved with them. Too long dance scenes seemed to fit better in a Carlos Saura movie.I stick with All about my mother and El Matador as Almodovar's best of the best.</fullReview>

Then, i don't support the way the care he gives is showed as voyeuristic and that his sexual offense is actually censored ! Honestly, i didn't recognize the look alike Messi guy from « Fuera Da Carta » who has again scenes with Lola in a cameo. Maybe it's cool to invite friends in a production but it's totally stupid to write a 1 minute character for that ! And for sure, as i wanted to watch the movie for Leonor, i'm totally disappointed as she is in coma nearly all the movie and thus just don't act.

		<shortDescription>A truly devastating drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talk to Her, directed by Pedro Almodovar, is about the friendship between 2 men caring for 2 comatose women. With TTH, go in knowing very little about the plot and brave yourselves. This movie is an emotionally devastating juggernaut full of gut-wrenching story beats, moral ambiguity and meticulously constructed themes. Although TTH takes a little while to get going and certain things feel a bit illogical, once it hits its stride you'll be unable to look away. While the performances are all around excellent, the star of the show is Almodovar. His script is disturbing, haunting, moving and never boring, and the way he constructs the movie visually is brilliant but also ingeniously subtle, meaning he doesn't resort to loads of flashy visuals to tell the story. It's a film which rewards repeat viewings enormously, and the film is so layered and complex that you'll constantly be re-interpreting the film and noticing new details. TTH is a really excellent drama and an unusually intelligent one at that. It shows an auteur at the top of his game and to study and analyse the film is like studying and analysing a great novel. It's a film that's really worth checking out, just don't read any spoilers beforehand. It may not be a thriller, but it will leave you breathless.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pedro Almodóvar follows his international success All About My Mother with an offbeat drama that explores the friendship of two men brought together under unusual but strangely similar circumstances. Benigno (Javier Camára) is a male nurse whose apartment overlooks a dance studio run by Katerina (Geraldine Chaplin); he often sits on his balcony and watches one of Katerina's students, Alicia (Leonor Watling), and he finds himself becoming infatuated with her. When Alicia is severely injured in an auto accident that leaves her in a coma, Benigno discovers she has been admitted to the hospital where he works, and he spends his days caring for a woman he now deeply loves but has barely met. Marco (Darío Grandinetti) is a journalist who was assigned to interview Lydia (Rosario Flores), a well-known female bullfighter whose on-the-rocks romance with another toreador, "El Ni?o de Valencia" (Adolfo Fernández), has made her the focus of the tabloid press. During Marco's interview with Lydia, he goes out of his way to treat her kindly, and she appears to return his attention. During the bullfight which follows, Lydia is gored by the bull, and is now in a coma; Marco is certain his interview broke her steely concentration, and he spends most of his days at the hospital, convinced her injuries are his fault. Alicia and Lydia are both housed in the same ward of the same hospital, and in time Benigno and Marco become close friends, bonding in their shared devotion to women who cannot return their affection.</fullReview>

I had deep feelings for the situations that the characters lived. After the first feeling I wanted to know more of this director's work. I started to see other movies and quickly I realized that I was completely impressed by the work of Almodovar, especially for its complex and unpredictable full of depth and emotion content. "Talk to Her" is a film full of symbolism, colors that remain in memory, music (Caetano Veloso) that makes the imagination and passion fly, passion for life and death. The naturalness of the performances and sensual universe created is simply magnificent. In short, this drama of impossible love, painful memories and beautiful images, is the kind of movie I love to watch and I would love to do.

		<shortDescription>A New Direction For a New Spain...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pedro Almodovar's films are greatly loved, hated and debated, but one cannot dispute that they have left their mark, not only in Spanish cinema, but in the global history of filmmaking. Hable Con Ella or Talk to her is a Pedro Almodovar film, released in 2002. It is an intoxicating metaphysical film of alienation, reconciliation, love and fate, delivered in a most unusual and enticing plot. In true Almodovar-style, it illustrates the struggle between traditional Spain, and a globalized society in which emotions, communication and identities are disintegrating. It is a postmodern take on Sleeping Beauty, situated in a medical center named, "El Bosque," ("The Forest") and revolving around a beautiful comatose ballerina. Like his previous movies, there exists this wavering dance- between reality and theater, and gender identities.Two men befriend each other- Marco is the lover of the comatose, matador female, Lydia. Benigno, in the neighboring patient's room, is the quasi-homosexual nurse of the vulnerable comatose ballerina, Alicia. Benigno represents the world of the past, the emotive, and the feminine. He tries to persuade, Marco, the successful journalist, and masculine symbol of the alienation found in a capitalistic society, to talk to the comatose Lydia. Lydia is cold and unresponsive-already dead, and in the end it is her and Benigno, with their conflicting gender identities who must die and allow for the two 'normal' individuals (Marco &amp; Alicia) to move on in life together. Capitalism thus triumphs but in the end, Marco may become the bridge between the world of the past and that of modernism.Almodovar's direction is captivating. He takes viewers away from the flash of American films, and zeros in on the environment and the individuals. The film is a sensory delight, enticing with both its bold colors and soft music. Above all else, it is a new direction for Almodovar?Unlike his previous films which focused on the friendships between women, here the women cannot speak so the men must be the ones who explore their feminine side and talk. The result, an unlikely friendship in the past, but one which symbolizes broken barriers in a new Spain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pedro Almodovar makes emotionally challenging films. Talk to Her continues that tradition. Benigno and Martin are two guys who meet ; each being tied to a comatose woman. Benigno works as a private nurse for a dance student named Alicia. While in a coma, she becomes pregnant and Benny is sent to prison for rape. He claims that it is a love affair.Marco is a travel writer whose girlfriend Lydia was gored by a bull while working as a matador. A previous boyfriend of Lydia's tells him that he had rekindled their relationship just before the accident. He goes to Jordan to write, and later reads some bad news about Lydia in a newspaper. He returns to Spain to help Marco and he hears of Alicia awakening from her coma to give birth. He does not tell Marco of her recovery and the ending is both tragic and poetic at the same time. No big name stars, such as Penelope Cruz; an Almodovar favorite, is used here, but the cast is uniformly good as is the script. Talk to Her is made for a thinking audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half of this is a near perfect film to my mind. I mean, here is a film about an unconscious woman being fantasized as graceful dancer, in more levels than one. Such poetry!But for it to work, you have to have some sense of how life is what images you choose or allow around you, how love is a matter of giving your controls to someone who can discover and reflect for you a part you lacked the images for. And know this with a heart that minds.So, is the comatose woman dreaming herself up as a fierce matador entangled in spontaneous love and gets to bleed a glorious, ceremonial death instead of the ordinary one she's been dealt? Further deep, is the male nurse daydreaming about his devotion to care for this woman as stolen glimpses from a balcony, the inmost soul of this woman as a dance studio?And does he enter her, a shrunk lover, in a vision that sublimates a desire that has grown to be destructive and poisonous? Or is that only an inmate's feverish fantasy from behind bars?Or is the whole nothing more than a performance shared by these two men in a theatre that generates inside their head images and a story where they are not mere spectators but protagonists who love and suffer? Or between this man and this woman, speaking about love that is to come?Coming up with a single story neatly answered doesn't matter of course, or it wouldn't be made in this elusive vein. The point is that any one of these threads is equally possible, equally illusory. It's enough to note that each of these, each one a kind of life fueled by desire and self, grows to be more or less disastrous.At the base layer we have formative emptiness in a latent state, this woman dreaming many possible worlds at once, each one as unreal and sublime as a dance by Pina Bausch, as intimate as a whisper sung by Caetano Veloso. Emptiness that holds the capacity for life and can be impregnated by every impulse to love, so that it blossoms with entire worlds populated by people and their stories.This formative emptiness perfectly envisioned as someone asleep.So if this is going to have power to get inside of you, you'll have to lie still and aware as entire dreams flow around you. You'll have to travel far by just being sentient as the whole thing comes into being and goes again.The only problem and one I have also encountered elsewhere with Almodovar is that he sets so many plates spinning - dance, film, writing, theater, TV, bullfighting, travel - that it's simply too much to wrestle by the end into one vision. Greenaway also suffers from this overflowing of form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tears of Empathy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acclaimed Spanish director Pedro Almodovar is renowned for his humorous but quite tragical films. His films are existentialist and the events are built on coincidence; the characters are "thrown into the world", to quote Jean-Paul Sartre, they have no destiny - only coincidence and series of events lead their lives. Almodovar is known for dealing with taboos - often associated with sexuality. Talk to Her studies themes such as femininity in masculinity, selfishness, obsession, difficulty in communication between the sexes, loneliness and intimacy. In the end it grows out to be a moral study and a beautiful picture of two men.Two men, unknown for each other sit in a theater and shed tears of empathy while watching a surreal ballet. One of the two men is Benigno a male nurse, who is taking care of a girl in a coma, to whom he has fell in love with. The other man, Marco is a journalist who out of the blue, falls in love with a female bullfighter. The next time we see the men, Marco's love the bullfighter has sunk into a coma as well; in result of which the two men become acquainted and they become friends. Taking care of and talking about emotions connect them and an unusual bond build between them.Talk to Her is a film about femininity in masculinity and vice-versa but it also studies the difficulty in communication between the sexes. Benigno suggests Marco to talk to her (the bullfighter) but Marco finds it odd and is unable to do it: but he is able of talking about almost everything to Benigno; also the sexualities of the two men start getting new features. The theme of difficulty in communication culminates in the end, when Marco goes to talk to Benigno's grave. He is ready to talk to Him the same things Benigno talked to Her (Alicia).The film deals with sexuality and communication but it grows out to be a moral study as well. Clearly both of the men take care of the women because of their own good; they're not just giving a helping hand, they get satisfaction for it and truly, only think about themselves. Also it is quite obvious that there is something wrong in Benigno's morality. Both of the men basically exploit the women to feel good but the obsessive love eventually leads to tragic consequences.Femininity in masculinity is also a common theme for Almodovar and it culminates in Talk to Her. It shows that men can have characteristics often labeled as feminine; they can get satisfaction from taking care of, talking about emotions and bathing as well. The loneliness Talk to Her studies is quite heart-wrecking; there is something similar to Krzysztof Kieslowski's A Short Film About Love (1988). The desperate obsession of Benigno makes one think that can love be anything but a sickness? Clearly the other characters prove this statement false, but with regards to Benigno loneliness has paralyzed love and turned it into obsession and selfishness.Tears have always been important for Almodovar and especially in Talk to Her where they become a part of the story. Both of the men shed tears of empathy in the beginning and as the story goes on Marco and Benigno shed tears of empathy for their loves. Later on also the love of Benigno, Alicia cries. The motive of tears culminates in the last scene where Alicia and Marco are watching a play: fiction becomes reality. The line between the characters and the audience breaks up when we are supposed to shed tears of empathy just as Marco and Benigno did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Almodovar's More Satisfying Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I run hot and cold with Pedro Almodovar's films. Sometimes I think they're exquisite; other times I think they're glorified soap operas."Talk to Her" is one of the better Almodovar films I've seen, an imaginative and touching story about an unlikely friendship between two men who both are caring for women in comas. The film has many of the characteristics, both narratively and stylistically, that we've come to expect from Almodovar: examinations of gender roles and sexuality; relationships between men and women, between women and women, between men and men; bright, saturated color schemes; careful use of widescreen to consciously frame his actors in specific ways. And the story, though it sounds like the stuff of soap operas on paper, plays out as something much more complex, thoughtful and satisfying.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My second favorite Almodovar film, after 'All About My Mother'. A moving and complex study of the relationship between two men, and their connection to women in comas. A few brilliantly funny moments, and some ultimately very creepy undertones keep it from being over- sentimental. Every character is more complex then they first appear, and the confusion between what is good and what is bad in both intent and effect is very rich. Some great camera work too. Gets slow in a few spots, and the sentiment still goes over the top in a few places, but still a terrific film about the similarities and differences between love and obsession.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Girlfriend in a coma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, TALK TO HER (Hable con Ella) isn't a bad movie but after seeing it, I felt that something was fishy. Maybe that one of the leading actors, the male nurse Benigno, looked like a gay alien from outer space with too much Make-up? Maybe that the other leading actor, author Marco, seemed to have a bad day everyday, had a grumpy look on his face and started to cry too easily? Or was it the female characters? Rosario Flores, the most unattractive she-male I've ever seen in a Spanish production, wasn't even an entirely sympathetic figure, because she cheated on Marco and couldn't depart from her ex-lover. Leonor Watling, although very pretty and sexy (just like Elena Anaya) was mostly in a coma and couldn't show off her acting abilities at all. She was reduced to her nice boobs and sizzling female curves.The topic of raping a comatose patient was handled with subtlety and creativity, which I found was one of the strong points of the movie. Some American director, brainwashed by Hollywood studio executives, probably would have done this in a more explicit manner. The story was OK but not Oscar-worthy. One or two things were quite naive in my book, like the fact that a pretty girl like Alicia (Leonor Watling) did not seem to have a boyfriend before she fell in a coma. In real life interesting girls like her always have a boyfriend, mostly a sporty male-model type with rich parents and not an average-looking but nice guy like Benigno. Why can't the male-model-types fall in a coma? OK, I'm off topic...This movie tried to be emotional but was quite rushed in parts and didn't manage to evoke deep feelings, in my opinion. Women will see this differently. I think that the drama was a bit forced but fortunately there were also very good moments. My problem with Almodovar-movies: They always have a few gripping and very creative scenes but also cliché-ridden ones that spoil the film being a perfect film.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almodovar's Triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Talk To Her" is perhaps the best film that Pedro Almodovar has made.It is the story of two men who are in love with two women who are both in comas in the same clinic. While that premise alone will turn a lot of people away from seeing it, it is not done in an unseemly or bizarre exploitative manner. This is about two different love stories.Benigno meets, falls in love with and becomes obsessed with Alicia, a dancer who studies in a studio just outside his apartment window. Benigno meets her and walks Alicia home one day after a rehearsal, and learns a little about her. He is also a nurse at the clinic that Alicia is sent to after she falls into a coma, from an automobile accident. He bathes her, does her nails and hair, and talks to her as though she could hear him and would respond to him. For four years he cares for her and does some of the things that she had wanted to do prior to the accident. He then tells her all about what happens and feels as though they are sharing it together.Marco is a writer who is interested in interviewing Lydia, a Spanish bullfighter. He comes to her rescue one night and a relationship develops. When she is gored by a bull and placed in a coma, Marco has a had time knowing how to deal with this once vibrant woman.Benigno and Marco meet, and Benigno lets him know that although the ladies may be in a coma, and all of the doctors say it's hopeless, he should talk to Lydia and not give up hope that she will someday come out of it.The relationships may seem one-sided, but they're really not. Benigno is able to get what he needs from Alicia, just by being there for her and thinking that she needs him. Lydia is able to heal Marco from a different relationship that went sour. Benigno gets a friend in Marco, something that he had not had with another man, and Marco gets Benigno who teaches him that it's alright to believe and accept a situation that does not always make sense.The film opens with a dance sequence that depicts the difficulties of people blindly trying to make their way through a miserable existence. There is another dance sequence that closes the film that is much more positive and shows how alive people can be when they enter into relationships, either as friends, lovers or acquaintances.The acting from the leads is nothing short of excellent. But it is the steady hand of Almodovar that makes this film. His characters and story are rich in their complexities, but also communicate simple truths about relationships. I'm sure that I am not doing the story justice here, because there are so many levels of life and relationships that are examined that it will require multiple viewings in order to fully absorb it all.The production work, from the design, lighting, cinematography are all first rate. Almodovar does some exquisite work using tableaux through out the film. While many people have felt that "All About My Mother" was his most personal film, I believe that "Talk To Her" is one of his most accessible films for all audiences.This is a film not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love is the saddest thing when it goes away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almodovar has written and directed another brilliant film that shows us how the human need for love can inspire strange, and even obsessive, responses in those who are unable to receive the love. This film is about man's love for women, and has influences in Spanish, German, and Brazilian art forms.Some of the movie is spent on bullfighting, as one of the main characters is a female bullfighter. The showing of her dressing is impressive. The actions in the ring are both beautiful and tragic.But, the film is mostly about two men who love two women who tragically end up in comas. There are tragic endings in two cases, but promise in the others. It is a story of love and is very touching, even if some parts are distasteful.This film has just about the weirdest scene I have ever witnessed when there is a movie within the movie that becomes part of the movie, and a man shrinks to about three inches tall and moves into his lover's vagina while she is sleeping. You have to see the film just to see this. Weird.The film is just wonderful. I am getting so attached to Almodovar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almodovar's direction enables one to appreciate how unusual people can be just like you and me. The film takes its time with its characters, but does so in order to create an intense passion between the lead characters.Darío Grandinetti is the absolute tragic lover, who you not only feel for, but completely understand his passions. Complimenting and at times outdoing him is other lead Javier Cámara, who you learn to love in spite of his terrible actions as he always appears so innocent and pure that you wish the world could relate to him.The women do not have much to say but they are both gorgeous and give off deep passion(Rosario Flores as Lydia) to curious flirtation(Leonor Watling as Alicia).The Spanish music works well for several moods of the film, creating both tragic and uplifting scenes. This most noticible right before the credits roll at the end.In terms of cinematagrophy, rooms have warm or dreary colors depending on the characters moods and often complement the characters. The hospital is simple in spite of what happens there, while Benigno's apartment is ornate, with little taking place there.Almodovar creates an engaging film that works off its characters and unorthodox story about unusual but justifiable love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Hable Con SPOILERS* The writer Marco (Dario Grandinetti) and the nurse Benigno (Javier C?mara) meet by complete chance, as the first's girlfriend, Spain's N°1 toreadora Lydia (Rosario Flores) falls into a coma after having been badly injured by a bull, and is brought into the clinic 'El Bosque' ('The Wood') where the second works.Slowly, over time, a steady friendship develops, and it gets stronger and stronger, to the point that Marco will be the only one to stay by his side after Benigno makes a terrible mistake because of his love for Alicia (Leonor Watling), a young dance student he has taken care of for four years, and knows even from before...Poignant and heart-breaking, 'Hable Con Ella' is another great movie by the Spanish Fellini, Pedro Almodovar, who has left for once, his colourful and larger-than-life females (which are great, but can grow quite tiring after a while) out of the picture, and used a non-linear narrative structure, that actually benefits the movie.The only thing I hated was when Alicia's ballet instructor (Geraldine Chaplin) spoke about her choreography, 'Trincea', especially when she said something derivative about men, and then said 'no offense' (offense taken), but basically the whole idea of 'masculine down-feminine up'. I don't understand what good she is for in the movie, and it should've been better not to have her character.Hable Con Ella: 8/10.</fullReview>

In this opportunity,the plot seemed more like a Latin American soap-opera,but this didn't rest the merits in the end,a sole journalist called Marco(great Grandinetti!)falls in love with a sexy bullfighter called Lidia(Rosario Flores)crashed by a fiend bull,falling down into a coma,one male nurse called Benigno(Javier Camera)was infatuated by pretty dancer called Alicia,in a similar state of coma as Lidia sharing the same room at the hospital,this platonic relation happened since Alicia danced in the same street where Benigno lives,a common interest between Benigno and Marco creates a strange friendship,the fatal fate ended this love in silence Benigno jailed and the broken dreams will force the final encore. Grandinetti was the best performer here, the another players did it well,but it's so good to see Geraldine Chaplin,a real glory of the past,showing her talent although doesn't appear so much.Almodovar sometimes is hunting high and low,luckily this time did the real stuff for all.</fullReview>

Marco encountered a man called Benigno in the hospital. Benigno had been taking care of a female patient who was in a coma for four years. It turned out to be another touching love story.It was an enchanting movie, though its rhythm was slow. After I finished watching the movie, I found that pure love did not just existed in Korean movie. This Spanish movie was not definitely a tearjerker that Korean romance movies were good at. I was deeply attracted and moved by the pure love that was revealed in the movie.Director Pedro Almodovar did a wonderful job.An excellent Spanish drama you should not miss. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pedro's Jobs for the Boys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pedro Almodovar's dynamic direction, shot selection and creative verve turns a simple story of obsession into a gripping feature-length drama laced with intrigue and black humour.As with many of his films, Talk to Her is devoted to sexually ambiguous male protagonists. This is not the first time the female leads have missed out on extensive characterisation ? indeed, his ladies here spend the majority of their screen time unconscious in hospital beds while the men are intensely studied.World-weary travel writer Marco forms a friendship with hospital porter Benigno when his matador girlfriend Lydia is critically injured by a bull. Benigno, an oddball who spent early adulthood tending his ailing mother, dedicates all his time to caring for another comatose patient, ballet dancer Alicia, upon whom he has a somewhat unhealthy fixation.Much of the film explores the benefits of talking to brain-dead patients in the hope of channelling positive energy and triggering miracle recoveries, but this is far from inspiring, feel-good fare. Marco, a cynic, clings to Benigno's positivity as Lydia's life ebbs away, but remains troubled by Benigno's overzealous affection for Alicia. Eventually he retreats leaving Benigno alone and unstable in a uniquely precarious situation.Through flashback, we learn how Benigno started to stalk Alicia shortly before the car accident that almost killed her. Now he is her constant companion, bathing her, dressing her ? even supervising sanitation during menstruation. Her father, a psychiatrist, is more interested in Benigno's sexuality and lack of social skills than any potential danger to his daughter ? after four years in a coma, he has reasoned that she will never recover.The plot is peppered with neat metaphor, usually relayed through Benigno's frank revelations ? the most memorable being a black and white vignette about a magic shrinking potion. In fact, it is a testimony to Almodovar's mischievous style that he can include a scene where a man dives head-first into a giant woman's open vagina without relinquishing his 15 certificate. Actually it is this scene that is pivotal to the story. Faced with such overtly sexual thoughts, Benigno's already questionable motives for tending Alicia spill over into physical action, and what was once a quirky, off-beat tale of love and friendship, now becomes a powerful study of mental instability and serious crime.This is tricky for the viewer to deal with for while we have previously enjoyed Benigno's disarming comic naivety, his sinister exploits make us feel duped and guilty.But an Almodovar film is not meant to be a comfortable ride and while a lot of the credit must go to a nicely layered performance by Javier Camera as Benigno, it is the direction that lifts this movie above the mediocre. It is bursting with originality, and typical of Almodovar's style that the traditionally conventional characters (here represented by Alicia and her self-important ballet instructor) are ignored and even ridiculed, whereas the freaks and the miscreants are portrayed sympathetically and intimately ? the director is evidently fascinated by the workings of twisted minds and refuses to judge them. As a result, his films are witty, engaging and can never be accused of predictability.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talk to her...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almodovar's highly acclaimed drama tells of the relationship which builds between two very different men as the women they care for lie in, possibly permanent, comas.Almodovar has said that male characters tend to inspire him to write tragic stories, whilst female characters inspire comedies. Anyone who's seen his frantic, farcical "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" can attest to that. While by no means tragic in the classical sense, Almodovar's "Talk to Her" is an interesting and mature exploration of a multitude of themes - from social misfits, relationships, love, loneliness. Despite a very strong cast, particularly Javier Camera as Benigno, the male nurse who appears to be the perfect carer, but who MAY hide a dangerously delusional psyche, and an attractive, rich visual style, the story just didn't resonate with me as a whole. Still a strong, slightly melodramatic, drama with a wonderfully outrageous silent film sequence - worth seeing for that alone! 7/10</fullReview>

Knowing the language and Spanish people as I do, I cannot come to fully like this film. Spain is hot, people are the way they are, and it just doesn't fit right in the film as a whole the sensitive and quiet ways. If it was a French movie, I would say all right, French people are blasé and beautifully so. But here something is missing, that constant "cono" and something bizarre. Besides, the whole 'beautiful imagery' is starting to bore me to death and to seem pointless. It is time for world cinema to take other and new turns and to start something else - I can't stand seeing those bright colours anymore, they have become a cliché for good cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Relationships of Four Complex Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films are weird beyond description. You could just call them unique or distinctive, but some are just plain odd. Pedro Almodóvar's Talk to Her is one of those films that, when it gets right down to it, is bizarre. Yet it is exactly that aspect of this film that makes it so memorable, albeit some of the memories are those I would rather forget.The film really has four main characters, two of which are men and two of which are women. First is Benigno, a man who has lived almost his entire life taking care of a woman. The first woman in his care was his mother, and his constant attention toward her kept him from experiencing the real world. The woman in his care at a private clinic where he works is Alicia, a woman who has been in a coma for a long while. The full extent of Benigno and Alicia's relationship is developed on film, and it is indeed the oddest relationship ever to appear on screen. Javier Cámara's performance as Benigno is somewhat disturbing, but intriguing throughout.Second is Marco, a journalist who is in essence the opposite of Benigno. Marco is one who has experienced the world around him, while Benigno is one who naively and curiously examines and experiences life because he knows so little about it. Marco is the boyfriend of Lydia, another woman who has fallen into a coma following a horrible accident. Their relationship is developed in a different method than that of Benigno and Alicia, but it too is intriguing nevertheless. Darío Grandinetti puts in a good performance as Marco, and the film continues to intrigue as the relationship between Marco and Benigno begins to develop as well.Pedro Almodóvar's direction and screenplay are both incredible. He goes about things in such a away as to set himself apart from every other director and writer. It's hard to describe direction, but Almodóvar's is beautiful, colorful, and full of life. I do have a couple complaints, however. First, I do enjoy bizarre filming methods, but Almodóvar's examination of the female body and female pleasure no less than stained my mind with peculiar images that I could never forget even if I wanted to. Furthermore, I felt that, at points, the film progresses to quickly instead of allowing the viewer to soak up what he or she is witnessing on screen.Overall, I've never seen a film so bizarre, yet so mysterious. I love Almodóvar's examination of life, and although the story is very complex, he somehow manages to remain focused on the many relationships and intricate characters he presents. There were moments of disgust for me, but there were also moments of great, yet subtle pleasures, such as the beautiful contrast between the beginning and the end of the film.This definitely is not for all tastes, but if you're looking for something different, this is it.Final Grade: B+.</fullReview>

Honestly it lies in his vivid, yet subtle use of colors. These colors play as the back ground to his compelling and loving actors. You can always tell a good foreign film when you notice that you've found a natural balance between subtitles and the spoken dialog. The story of two men, one a nurse, the other a reporter, who meet through the comatose and hospitalized women they love and the bond they find through their respective discoveries, losses, love and solitude is truly spellbinding.

The characters are well developed, there is some interesting symbolism, and it is always interesting to watch, however arguably a too large a focus on style suffers this film the ability to be perfect viewing.

		<shortDescription>great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie very moving and insightful. Not only did it provide great insight to the Spanish culture, but it was symbolic and meaningful. The viewer experiences a controversial issue (the rape) from different perspectives, including that of the convict. It was very interesting. However, I didn't really understand the significance of Marco's involvement with the naked snake lady many years ago in the desert, and how that affected his current relationship. Why would the author include that? It was brief and not well explained. Perhaps it's only offhand. Regardless, I loved this movie, for many reasons. I would recommend it for the viewer who appreciates the "meaningful" type. (Don't worry, it's entertaining as well, I think.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some films that come along that defy explanation. You just have to experience them. This is one of them. It is a tragedy at heart. It is also quite disturbing at the core. Yet I've never been repulsed,yet moved by one singular bad mistake from a character. The character of Benigno Martin(portrayed by Javier Camara)is a tragic Shakespearian figure from afar. He desires the heart of a vegetable named Alicia(Leonor Watling)for whom he fell in love with before her coma. He becomes a nurse and really takes care of this girl while she lays comatose. He commits a forbidden morally wrong move. This film does something amazing to me because the film doesn't take sides. It doesn't make Benigno a repulsive creature despite this act. What he does is not by lust,but an unspeakable love. He devotes his existence to taking care of Alicia. He befriends another tragic hero named Marco(terrific performance by Dario Grandinetti)who is a writer. Marco is in a relationship with a female bullfighter named Lydia, who is gored by a bull and is rendered comatose. Marco and Benigno become friends and look after Alicia and Lydia. Lydia was to tell Marco that she would be starting back a relationship to former flame. She doesn't get to tell Marco because of the goring that takes place. This film ends as sadly as a Shakespearian tragedy. I never saw a happy conclusion,but was thoroughly moved by it. The acting is stellar by all involved and the story is so compelling and well directed. *****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a different way of LOVE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an interesting movie for me, I could not figure out whether it was good or bad but I can say that I was not bored while watching it. When I think about the visual things about the movie I must say that there was nothing special about that, I mean the shootings or the colors etc. However, there were several scenes which were successful in squeezing my throat with the help of the very well attached music. The music in this movie is great, it gave me really emotional times. And for the last thig, there was the plot and the acting. The plot and the execution of it was good, Pedro Almadovar is a really unique director I should say. In the movie there were only three characters to notice and to think about. The first one is Beningno, a young, clever girl in her late twenties. Second, there is Marco, an experienced, sensitive, emotional lady in her late thirties. And for the last, there is Lydia, a tough, emotional, charismatic man, who makes his fortune and reputation by being a torrero(bullfighter.) In fact by looking at the names and reading the other responses you might think that I am lying since Beningno and Marco are male names and Lydia is a female name. Actually, you are right by your ideas about the names but I am not lying too. In the movie, Beningno and Marco are male but they obviously show a female profile and Lydia draws a male picture, at least I think that way. Almadovar is so brilliant and successful in switching and resetting the genders in the movie that at some point you get really mixed up and surrender your mind and soul to the screen which is already pouring love down. For the first time in my life I have seen such characters and lifestyles so I could not judge what is right or wrong during the movie. Eventually, at the end of the movie you find yourself witnessing a very different kind of love and sacrifice and asking yourself what is right or wrong, moral or not when it is about love and all. I think I liked this movie, and I think I should watch the other movies of Pedro. By the way, I should say that Pedro is a gay, so the mixing up of genders in this movie can be explained a little bit by that maybe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>which is the way all movies should be and rarely are. The premise of the movie is offputting in the extreme but works on many different levels. It shows men in the roles of caretakers of two comatose women, tending to their every need and developing their own friendship with each other along the way. There are many wonderful scenes in this and to write about them would spoil it. But a small sample would be that I was captivated by a scene of haunting musicians at a party and mesmerized by the female matador. This is not to be missed. It stays with me a long time afterwards and I would see it again (and again). 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first Almodovar film I have seen. It was exquisite. Almodovar, as writer, has quick dialog, that is not complicated, but penetrating. Almodovar, as director, is able to create an amazing style, through depth, which creates the essential atmosphere for the film. None of his shots are a waste in presenting the story, and developing its ideas and characters. Grandinetti and Flores acted perfectly in their roles, Marco being one of the deepest characters I have encountered in film. The film was in one sense disturbing, and in the same sense enlightening. It develops the ideas inherent in love, and obsession, from a completely humanistic eye. Great film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The talk around Hollywood last year was that Pedro Almodovar's `Talk to Her' was a certain cinematic classic. I guess that grapevine talk transcended itself all the way to Academy voters because it was recognized as the Best Original Screenplay at last year's Academy Awards. The premise of `Talk to Her' does possess an avant-garde aspect about it: Benigno is an obsessed male nurse who converses relentlessly to a female comatose patient. Our lunatic befriends Marco, a writer who coincidentally enough is also is in a state of depression after his bullfighter girlfriend falls into a coma after being beaten by a ______ (yes! You guessed it, bull!). That is no bulls***! Our main male protagonists might appear as 2 `coma'mierdas but their friendship is the heartbeat of `Talk to Her'. Guys, that enough in itself is good enough for you to talk to her to go view `Talk to Her'. **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most significant thing that I noticed about this film was the use of warm colors, especially the orange, red, and yellow. Visually it was just satisfying to the eye. I think this film was interesting in that all the characters had some reasons behind thier actions and was slowly revealed as the story progresses. Marco who always cried because he is still in love with his ex-girlfriend. Even when he was with the bull fighter he still cried at the music. The bull fighter who had already gotten back with her ex-boyfriend while she was with Marco. A comparison was made between the missionaries who raped the nuns and the rape that happened in the film. The silent black and white film was interesting in that the shrinking man climbed into his lover's vagina which might be saying that he is pleasuring her forever in sacrificing himself. It can also be compared to what took place with the rape in the hospital. Benigno sacrificed himself to wake Alicia from her coma by making her pregnant and having himself being sent to jail. I liked the ending where it seems that Marco and Alicia are starting something new either its a relationship or something new in their lifes. After all Marco is the only person who knew Benigno well and the truth to it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almodóvar's most lyrical film so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never has Almodóvar reached such a degree of lyricism so far as in Hable con ella. Nevertheless, he is still stirring the filth up from the bottom of human soul here - and, maybe, as he has never done before.Redemption here can be seen only by those who fully understand the bitter-sweet quality of our lives - from a sinful of act of desire love springs forth and gives life a fresh and brand new breath.There's no black against white as Almodóvar moves his magical paintbrush along the canvas of this touching portrait of the human soul. It finds love and poetry underneath the thick layer of confusion that entangles us all into this nasty world each and every day more human (in the basest acception of the word) and less humane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie comes from one of the best directors of this decade, almoldovar, he has directed movies such as about my mother, which no surprise won an oscar for best foreign film of 1999.two people lie in a coma, one was injured while bull fighting, the other was injured in a car accident. their lovers lie at their bed side, one an established travel book author, and the other a nurse. the twist? the two that ly in a coma are women, and the author and the nurse are men. this movie is about these two men, whose lives are intertwined by fate. this movie was in my opinion so moving, it makes you sympathize with characters who you would never sympathize with, but under these settings it is hard not too, to anyone who has thought of trying to watch a foreign movie, this is the one to start with, i promise you you will love it if you watch it with an open mind, this movie makes you realise that movies truly are a work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>you can't appreciate the complexity of this film until you see it. although it sounds almost implausible, i can vouch from experience that knowing people care for you and talk to you when you were in a coma provides comfort to an experience you don't remember. and although that doesn't really happen to the two women in the film, almodovar's idea to explore this becomes refreshing and intriguing almost beyond words. though bizarre, near tragic events arise from the bonds created between the women and the men who love and care for them, the film never transcends into some weepy creepy clichéd nightmare of a 'chick flick.' it deserves its oscars and should have been best film, not just best foreign film. completely different from early almodovar films, yet powerful. see 'kika' if you can find it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pillow Talk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Benigno (Javier Camara) fusses about the prone figure of the lovely, comatosed young woman (Leonor Watling) in the hospital bed, you at first, are struck by his devotion and gentleness. You assume that he is her spouse, her brother, or her best friend. He is wearing scrubs, but his demeanor is more than a mere caregiver. You must question his relationship to this woman, but you admire the dedication he appears to have for this patient. Something is amiss, but you put that in the back of your mind. As the movie progresses and Benigno's motivations become clear, you could kick yourself for liking him. He is certainly creepy, yet there is something inherently sweet about him. Such is the subtle maneuvers of this film. Marco's (Dario Grandinetti) first scene is one of emotional vulnerability, yet in spite of his tears at the ballet, he seems strong and virile. He is drawn to the woman in the man's sport Lydia (Rosario Flores). She, in spite of her fearlessness against a 2 ton bull, is reduced to tears of panic when confronted by a snake. Marco becomes her hero, and they begin a relationship. But Marco seems to occupy the periphery of her life. Reduced to little more than a member of her entourage, he seems emasculated around her. After her accident, he cannot bring himself to do what is so effortless for Benigno. He can't talk to her. What does occur is that Marco and Benigno become closer than either of them could ever be with the women that they love. It's a touching and complex moment when Benigno tells Marco that he would love to hug him. But the prisoners' glass is between them. Ultimately, the film is about friendship. I was pleasantly surprised by the devotion that Marco showed for Benigno. He had no qualms about declaring himself a friend even when it was apparent that Benigno committed an unthinkable act. This film was one that stayed in the mind long after the closing credits. The few complaints I have with it are that Lydia's character seemed to conveniently disappear when the plot was through with her, thus making Marco's connection to her rather flimsy. Also to nit-pick, Rosario Flores is not the most attractive woman on screen and at times she looked more like a man than either male leads. (perhaps that is what Almodovar was after, because Javier Camara has the softest hands I've ever seen on a man.) But overall, it is a thought-provoking and intelligent film. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a unique vision of love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pedro Almodovar's `Talk to Her' tells the tale of two men who become friends when the women they love both slip into comas. Benigno is a young man who has spent most of his life caring for his ailing mother. After she dies, Benigno, still a virgin, falls in love from afar with Alicia, a beautiful young dancer whom he sees rehearsing in the dance studio across the street from his mother's apartment. After just a few tentative and platonic encounters between the pursuer and the pursued, Alicia is involved in a car accident, which renders her comatose ? a condition that has lasted already four years when we are first introduced to the `couple.' Benigno, a trained nurse, has been hired by Alicia's father to provide her nearly round-the-clock care, a situation that Benigno is only too happy to accept since it allows him time to act out his love for her and to help deepen their `relationship.' Benigno quickly transfers the caretaker relationship he had with his mother to Alicia and finds himself well prepared for the role life has asked him to assume.Marco has lived a far more conventional, far more extroverted life than Benigno has, yet fate pulls them together anyway. A writer of travel books, Marco falls in love with a vibrant female bullfighter named Lydia, who, not long after they meet, is left comatose by a goring accident in the ring. Brought together by their common circumstances, Benigno and Marco become close friends and confidantes.Benigno is, in many ways, the film's most fascinating character. Here is a man who has attained manhood without ever once forging either a physical or emotional bond with a woman. As a result, Alicia's `condition' is ideal for him. He is able to construct his own romantic reality with a woman without having to actually interact with the object of his love. He can shower all sorts of gifts on her ? massages, haircuts, endless `conversations' ? while never having to risk rejection. In a sense, Benigno NEEDS Alicia to remain in her coma as a means of maintaining the equilibrium and order that make the relationship work. The problem is that, even given this `ideal' situation, not all of Benigno's needs are being met ? a fact that ultimately leads to tragedy for the obsessed young man.Unlike Benigno, Marco does not know how to deal with having his loved one rotting away in a vegetative state. Despite his love for Lydia, Marco can just not bring himself to lavish the kind of affection on her that Benigno does on Alicia. Marco also comes to understand that Benigno has a stronger, more `meaningful' relationship with Alicia while she is in a coma than Marco had with Lydia when she was not. Is there something to be said for Benigno's seeming ability to transform `dysfunctionality' into moral purity (at least till he crosses over the line in a major way later on in the film)? Yet, when the chips are down and Benigno needs a true friend, Marco is right in there ready to lend his support. This is the ethical code that defines his value as a human being.`Talk to Her' draws the audience slowly into its bizarre, often surrealistic little world (there's a great, hilarious ersatz silent film sequence that must be the craziest sex dream ever placed on film). Almodovar does a far better job here than he did in `All About My Mother' at keeping the potential melodrama of the concept under control. He doesn't allow the narrative to spin off into the sort of soap opera overkill that brought down that earlier work. In this film, every moment seems lyrical and understated, a tribute, as well, to the fine performances by Javier Camara and Dario Grandinetti as Benigno and Mario, respectively. Grandinetti is particularly effective at conveying the silent strength of a man confused by what is happening around him but willing to stand by and support those he feels need his help. One might find the air of indulgence and redemption that the filmmakers extend to Benigni at the end of the story to be a bit perverse, to say the least, but we at least understand why Marco would feel as he does about him.`Talk to Her' is a brave, occasionally ingenious film that casts a hypnotic spell over its audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little sympathy for the devil, is all I ask.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the second part of my commentary on this astonishingly moving film.***(Spoilers for this whole piece. Please skip this post is you have not seen the film.) ***There were many people who accused `Talk to her' for being offensive and morally irresponsible (i.e. by favouring the side of the rapist, Benigno)I tend to disagree with above argument. To me, its like a little sympathy for the devil. Same thing applies for `Happiness'. Paedophile or psychopath, its all the same when the acts committed is so unconscionable, people are bound to want to demonise those "seedy perverts". But films like these do not seek our sympathies for the wrongful doings of the protagonist. They just sought to shed some light on their frailties behind their obviously sick, twisted minds. Exploitation or otherwise, its left to individual interpretation. My moral compass is steadfast in real life. But when watching a film like this, I'm willing to consider what the film is attempting to tell us. It all depends on how the story is told and how one reacts to it. And IMHO, the film did not cross any boundaries, it didn't blatantly fight for Benigno's case. He was rightfully imprisoned and the opposite views were well anchored by Marco's voice of reason. So do I find this film offensive? No.**********Do I think others were wrong in thinking it otherwise?No. Everyone's entitled to their opinion.**********Do I condone the behaviour(i.e./ e.g. non-consensual sex acts, stalking etc)? Absolutely not, however misguided or mitigated, its a wrongful act.***********Do I think its rape? Yes.**********Do I think the protagonist think its rape? No. Or that's how the film portrayed him to be.**********With this in mind, should he still be punished?Absolutely.**********Do I sympathise with his not being able to tell the difference?Yes.**********Was this film judgemental, perverted, or down right disgusting?Will leave it to your individual interpretation.**********In support of my above arguments, case in point, the period setting of this film. `Talk to her' was wisely set in the present, instead of a pre-DNA technology era (i.e. 80's and before). Because by choosing a fairly modern setting, Almodovar has reigned in the ambiguity about Benigno's guilt (DNA testing would have sealed Benigno's fate long ago) so as not to distract the viewers. As it is, many audiences are already prone to sympathise with Benigno too much. Rendering his crime any less clearcut may infact tilt the delicate balance struck throughout the film(that of understanding Benigno's action but in no times condoning them). This would definitely have alienated more people as a result.Frankly, if the ambiguities were widened any further, I too would have no qualms joining others in protesting Talk to her's offensiveness and its ill treatment of women throughout. But thankfully, Almodovar did a most respectable job as the man behind this astonishing film of hard emotional truths and sincere relationship dynamics.Ultimately, is this a sad film? Yes, I do think so...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was it Roger Ebert who said 'Talk to Her' was "about women in comas and the men who love them"? Actually I found it was more about the men themselves, and the dynamics of relationships. It's also about the danger of losing oneself in dreams and fantasies, which, like drugs, are pleasant at first, but become a trap.I thought this movie would spend 95% of it's time at the bedside in a hospital, like 'My Dinner with Andre' in a different setting. But no, it's far more wide ranging and more special. And the relationship issues are much more varied and detailed than I thought.As a single person too, this movie slapped me in the face. It shouts "Hey! Get out of the house! You've been staring out the window for half an hour or half your life and you haven't done any LIVING. Don't just flip through travel magazines - travel! Don't just watch other people dance, or rise and fall in relationships. Get up and dance yourself. Make the phonecall, risk the hurt again and try a relationship, even one that's faulty, rather than fantasing about a perfect one that's only thin air.I once read somewhere that while an unexamined life is not worth living, an unlived life is not worth examining. To me, that's the difference between Marco and Benigno. And that's why I'm going to get up and turn off this computer. Have a great day. DO something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody thought that Almodovar had obtained his best success with "All About My Mother". However, the director has surpassed it with the film "Talk to her". The story is excellent, the performances are very good and the film has great tunes. The story is about the friendship between two men, Benigno (Javier Camara) and Marco (Dario Grandinetti). Benigno works in a private clinic where he looks after a woman in a coma, Alicia (Leonor Watling), a young ballet student. Marco looks after his girlfriend, who is in the private clinic where Benigno works. Marco's girlfriend is a bullfighter and is in a coma because she has been gored. Benigno and Marco meet in the clinic and become friends. Though in the majority of Almodovar's films the main characters are women, in this case it is different. The story is about the feelings and the friendship between two men. The style of the director has changed in this film. Overall, "Talk to her" is a great film. Proof of this is the oscar that Almodovar has won for best original screenplay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pedro Almodovar, you either understand his films and like them or you shun his masterpieces like the plague. I'm of the former genre. I think he is brilliant. "All About My Mother," was in my opinion a masterpiece. Cutting thru the sexual taboo's as with a Rapier, leaving you with your mouth wide open, or walking up the aisle.I was a little apprehensive about this new film,'Habla con ella,' but I shouldn't have worried as it was another triumph for the Director. Who else could direct a film about two comatose women and two oddball men who are in love with them, one being unnaturally fixated. The two men for the most part would not have even met had they not seen each other at the hospital, where Lydia (Rosorio Flores), and Alicia (Leonore Watting) have close rooms. Both women were dancers so-to-speak, Alicia was a classical ballet student and Lydia, danced with the Toro in the Arena of the noonday sun, the bull hooked Lydia and a car caught Alicia.The men Benigno, (Javier Camara), a nurse, and the one who talks to Alicia as if she were alive, and Marco (Dario Grandinetti), who is in love with Lydia, who is on the rebound from another affair....Both men do a great job and you can feel their angst, especially Benigno, as he is not in control of his feelings for Alicia.There was one of the greatest renditions of 'CU, CU ,RU, CU, CU, PALOMA, that I have ever heard, very sexy and moving.Also, Almodovar brings in his stars from other pictures. At the nightclub you will see a few actors from All About My Mother. Marisa Paredes, (Huma Rojo) and Cicilia Roth (Manuela) By far Rosorio Flores eats up the camera, especially in her bullring outfit, her face and litheness gives her a wonderfully tormented and tragic look. She is an Almodovar actor.ciao yaaah69 I give this flick 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An instant classic in my book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a film!`Talk to her' was that rare gem of a movie that kicked my gut till it bled. Because its emotional truth was so unparalleled, I was at a lost for words as to how I should praise the film to do it justice.Where do I begin? By my frank admission, this piece will be nothing but a gushing, onesided tribute to the masterful strokes of genius wielded by Mr Almodovar. So detractors(if any), you may stop reading now.First off, the songs featured and musical scoring for this film is nothing short of mesmerizing. The cinematography was appropriately evocative but not showy like most other art house projects. Even the title alone(`Talk to her') assumed an unexpectedly revealing resonance about the love the protagonists have for their respective women.In addition, individual set pieces strewn all over this picture, were exceptional and aplenty, from the enigmatic ballet performances, the eye-opening hospital procedurals to the poetically framed bull fighting sequences and that strangely moving `silent movie' interlude.And most heartbreaking of all, are the many genuine, often touching scenes of interaction between the two male leads, incrementally so towards the end of the film.All these brilliant parts were not just effectively realized on its own; they seamlessly melded into a collective crescendo by film's end. IMHO, after having witnessed such a magical film, I dare proclaim it worthy of the most cliché of accolades, that of an instant classic.(Spoilers ahead) One other unique achievement of this film though, is Almodovar's clever subversion of the audience' preconception, time and time again. Case in point, our initial character assumption of the care giving Benigno, was that he was gay. His face, his mannerism and his speech pattern all insinuated an effeminate slant, characteristic of gay stereotypes. On top of above attributes, Benigno's demeanor throughout the film was also set up as being quaintly innocent, yet reasonably unnerving.As such, when it became apparent that Benigno was not gay, but a man who raped the comatose Alicia(whom he nursed and cared for the last four years), our perception of the man was swung to the other negative extreme, one of a psychopathic deviant who committed a perverted criminal act.But by film's end, and upon reflection, what we got instead was one of the most shocking yet sympathetic take of a wayward protagonist since Dylan Baker's portrayal of the pedophilic father/child psychologist in Todd Solonz' Happiness.Excerpted here was Almodovar's take on Benigno's character,`The point about Benigno's character is that he is completely innocent, in the sense that he does not have experience. He lives in another world. This world is parallel to the real world but it has its own rules. Sexual orientation probably does not exist in this world.'By extension, society's accepted standards of sexual mores probably didn't applied either in Benigno's world, which explained(but not condoning) Benigno's deviancy.On hindsight, we should have known better than to pass out condescending pre-judgement, especially in an Almodovar film. Despite its offbeat premise, the screen pairing of Benigno and the equally(if not more) emotive Marco, is one of the best realized portrayal of male friendship on film, one that is courageously unblemished by the misguided connotation of homophobia.(End of spoilers)Via glimpses of Almodovar in the recent few awards show (Oscars/ Golden Globes etc), I knew very little of the man behind [b]All about my mother and this beautiful film[/b], besides his outward flamboyance and liberal peace stance.But through this surpassing film of humanistic sensitivity, I'm glad to know there's a director out there with this divine gift and generosity to create such insightful works of drama.There are many people touched by the film. One thus can't help but marvel at the incredible depths to which Pedro Almodovar dug, into that very essence of our hearts - empathy.Based on `Talk to Her' alone, Pedro Almodovar now ranks as one of my favourite writer/ directors (alongside PTA, Alexander Payne, the Coen Bros and the Sprecher Sis).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Losses, true love and weird miracles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film quite a lot, even if it's not my favorite Almodóvar.While the story is wild, the characters are very realistic. Not black &amp; white, as Hollywood usually likes them. Of course the film is not mainly about the friendship that grows between Marco and Benigno (stunning performance by Javier Cámara), but rather about losses, true love and weird miracles (life is so capricious!).While many people (logically) see Benigno's story as the center of the film, I related a lot with tear-prone Marco, who is the one learning about life during the film. (Benigno is Peter Pan, a forever wild child, wise, innocent and perverted, always locked in his mother's sick womb).The sentimental cuadrangle Marco-Lydia-Ni?o de Valencia-Marco's exgirlfriend is quite excruciating. Why can't Marco and Lydia be happy together, since they deserve to be? Because Marco can't forget his crazy ex girlfriend and Lydia can't forget Ni?o de Valencia, their toxic true-loves.What kind of cleansing must be done in order to make the improbable Marco-Alicia liaison work? What must be lost to regain life?Another great feature is Rosario Flores (Lydia) the daughter of mythical Lola Flores (the passionate epitome of Spanish folklore). She's far from being beautiful, but exudes tremendous personality. Her face while she's "knelt receiving from the burladero" (a suerte, a 'trick' which has sent many a bullfighter to the surgeon) tells us that she's letting the bull define her suerte, her fate: that this brave woman, torn between two lovers is, in fact, killing herself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almodóvar has created a film that is intensely moving and delves in the arcane recesses of one's feelings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin my review by saying this, even if you are a person who enjoys foreign entertainment, this film may not be your ?cup of tea.' Director Pedro Almodóvar (`All About My Mother,' `Live Flesh') explores the deepest emotions of loneliness, love and friendship, and weaves a story that is both beautiful and to a certain extent, disturbing. `Talk To Her' follows two stories, which eventually intertwine. The first is the story of Benigno Martín (Javier Camara) who is a nurse tending to a woman named Alicia (Leonor Watling), whom he falls deeply in love with. Alicia is in a coma due to a car accident and Benigno constantly speaks to her in the hopes that she will wake up and share at least a conversation with him. The second story involves a man named Marco Zuluaga (Dario Grandinetti) who is a writer who falls in love with a female bullfighter, Lydia González (Rosario Flores). However, she also falls into a coma after being attacked by a bull during a show. Having already lost love in his life, Marco gives up any hope for Lydia's recovery until he meets Benigno. Benigno tries to give Marco some hope for the future of Lydia, as Benigno has hope for his future with Alicia. The two men become good friends and share stories of their past experiences with the women. However, Benigno's love for Alicia turns into an obsession that leads to a deplorable act. All that Benigno will eventually have is a friendship with Marco, the one person who can truly comprehend his feelings for Alicia. `Talk To Her' was a wonderful motion picture for more reasons than one. Its direction was exceptional. Almodóvar provides a beautifully artistic setting for the characters to explore their emotions for each other. The acting was first rate and completely believable. The audience can feel the pain and anguish of Benigno and Marco as they struggle with accepting their lover's conditions. The screenplay, by Almodóvar, was superb and certainly worth its Oscar. There are also various dance sequences in the film that exhibit real beauty and intrigue and evoke profound emotion if one allows himself/herself to be taken with the film's artistic integrity. The film does incorporate an incident among one of its chief characters that the audience may have difficulty in accepting. But at the same time, the audience may sympathize with the character, if that's even possible, and see how the conditions that these characters are living in drive them to be the people they are. In the end, Almodóvar has created a film that is intensely moving and delves in the arcane recesses of one's feelings. ***1/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In this film, women get their revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mujeres.Femmes.Ragazzo.Women.They have always been the central figures in Pedro Almodovar's films.His "inspirational muse", so to speak.His first full-length film, 'Pepi, Luci, Bom', focuses on three female friends (an abused heiress, a masochist wife and a lesbian rock singer) living in the drug-and-rock-'n'-roll-era Madrid;'Matador' has a woman lawyer taking up the rape case of a young man who faints at the sight of blood, while struggling with her own perversion of being sexually-aroused by scenes of murder;the cult hit 'Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown' features the brilliant Carmen Maura as a voice actress clinging on to what's left of her stable mind after being left by her lover (who has a wife, by the way);the under-appreciated 'High Heels' gives us the captivating duo of Marisa Paredes and Victoria Abril as celebrity mother and daughter trying to pick up the pieces of their broken relationship;and, of course, the Oscar-awardee 'All About My Mother', which serves as, in the words of film critic Leonard Maltin, "a paean to women--in real life, in film and on stage."With his latest and widely-acclaimed work, 'Talk to Her', most people have remarked that the Spanish filmmaker has "shifted" his attention to the "less-fair sex" (the title of his film-in-progress, 'Male Education', is an indication that he is progressively heading toward that direction).Well, not quite.We may have seen for most of the screening time crucial developments in the lives of the characters of Javier Camara and Dario Grandinetti, but what--or rather, who--actually triggered those developments?How could possibly the journalist Marco (Grandinetti) and the nurse Benigno (Camara) cross paths and develop an intense friendship (the most vivid portrayal of male friendship in the cinema as far as I know, almost surpassing the kind seen in Truffaut's 'Jules et Jim' and Tornatore's 'Cinema Paradiso') if not for the respective women in their lives, by way of the essentially similar tragedies that befell on them? Whenever we see the two men in their respective moments of emotive outpouring--Marco in quiet desperation, Benigno in an outburst of speech--they're always meant for the bullfighter Lydia (Rosario Flores) and the ballerina Alicia (Leonor Watling).It's in the passivity of the two women in their "clinically-dead" state that the two men are spurred to activity that'll definitely have a major bearing on the course their lives will take.In that sense, Lydia and Alicia are actually active, the ones who still "have the say." It's true that Almodovar focused this time on two male characters brought together by fate and chance, but it's really a way of saying, at least in this case, that such a friendship wouldn't have happened without the quirky and unpredictable trajectory of life playing its hands first upon the two ladies.In the above-mentioned films, the maestro of the outrageously original stories of love, desire and relationships always gives his female protagonists a definitive and pivotal moment of assertion--a kind of breaking the barriers.In 'Women on the Verge...', it's when Carmen Maura decides to finally do away with all the things that remind her of her nowhere-to-be-found lover, to the point of literally burning the house down (well, almost);'High Heels' has Victoria Abril bringing the audience to their feet when, while doing her job as a newscaster, she suddenly owns up on nationwide TV to a sensational crime being implicated on her;while in 'All About My Mother', it's hard not to be moved by the sight of Cecilia Roth (the 'Mother' in the title) carrying in her arms the newly-born son of the AIDS-stricken nun (who died while giving birth), an epiphanic moment where each one reciprocally replaces the loss in the other's life.Such a moment is not missing in 'Talk to Her' either.It's tempting to say it's the stunningly kinky 'Shrinking Lover' part.But it should not.Rather, it's that equally stunning--and surprising--moment where Marco, after a long while, visits Benigno in prison, for the latter has been convicted for "taking advantage" of the comatose Alicia.The two men's exchanges and gestures give us a masterful suggestion of homosexual affection.Thus, even if Almodovar has bestowed the moment of realization and re-evaluation upon his male leads this time, the emotional structure is still molded according to feminine sensibilities.If in his early obras, Almodovar always portrayed men as the cause of suffering of women, in his latest masterpiece, he seems to have taken his "revenge" by letting the "less-fair sex" feel right in their hearts how it is to be the fairer sex.Aggression toward the opposite gender gives way to affection for the same gender.As if such were not enough, the film's concluding moment offers a clue to a beautiful relationship in the making as provoked by the resurrected character of Alicia, the ballerina.It's still the woman who comes the last--and the best--out of the Pandora's box of tragedy and despair.When Roman Polanski won the Best Director award for 'The Pianist' in last month's Oscars, he missed what could've been his chance to personally dedicate the award to his fellow Poles who were the heart of his film.If it was Pedro who got the "bald man" instead, he might've taken the opportunity to "talk" to all the women out there, they whom the maestro has always loved in his films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching and masterfully crafted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pedro Almodovar of Spain has the reputation of being one of the world's great directors and though this is the only one of his films that I have seen, judging by it he deserves the acclaim. ?Talk to Her' is the work of a master, one who knows when to be restrained and when to be passionate, one who has written and directed a film that shines with maturity and quality.?Talk to Her'is about two men in love with women who are in comas. Marco is a journalist who has an affair with Lydia, a female bullfighter and emotional wreck. One day she comes off the worst in a bullfight and ends up in hospital with brain damage. Also at the hospital is Alicia, a beautiful young dancer who injured her head in a car crash and her nurse Benigno, who has fallen in love with her. They are very different men ? Marco is tall, handsome and assured while Benigno is short, plain and a virgin at 30 ? but they become friends. As the movie progresses we find out about their pasts and the similarities and differences in their relationships with the comatose women. Then Benigno does something that leaves him with no one to turn to,except Marco.The plot could have been material for a bad tearjerker, but Almodovar is more subtle than that ? ?Talk to Her' is poignant rather than weepy, lightened by touches of humour and has a couple of surprises that remind us that life and people are, for better or worse, unpredictable. I find anying to criticize in the acting or cinematography, and the music is wonderful ? all of which does lead to a short review! It does not have as many really powerful scenes as other great movies I have seen, but ?Talk to Her' is touching and except for one overly-explicit silent movie sequence, flawless. It will be enjoyed by anyone who can handle subtitles and has a taste for romantic dramas. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almodovar's exploration of loneliness and intimacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that many will not forget easily, but will leave the theater thinking about. It is also a film, I think, about loneliness and intimacy, and the way different people deal with those emotions and issues.The film's plot is enhanced and even partially explained by the dance sequences and the silent film excerpt found in it, beginning with the first dance sequence in which two women in slips, their faces expressing pain, soulfully dance with eyes shut in what appears to be a cafeteria empty of all customers but one--a man who keeps rushing to move chairs out of their way to keep them from falling over them. This becomes a metaphor, I think, for the relationship of Benigno, the male nurse, and Alicia, a coma victim he cares for in a private clinic, since he is constantly helping her, making life go on for her. However, it also suggests Marco's relationship with Lydia, a bullfighter in a coma, perhaps even more so since he is pitifully inept in trying to help her.As for the silent film, let me simply say that it may be both an inspiration to Benigno in the plot, and an explanation for his subsequent behavior to us.Considering the passivity of the two coma victims, and the fact that rape occurs (off stage), this film is, remarkably, not misogynistic. Never did I feel that Almodovar was saying how much easier it was to deal with women when they were doll-like figures who don't speak, as compared to vital, unpredictable, normal women. Instead, odd as it was, it suggested a level of intimacy and care that conversation would somehow spoil. I felt sympathy for both men, and a desire to see the aptly named Benigno somehow realize his dream of uniting with Alicia. I also sympathized with Marco's inability to relate to Lydia.The only complaint I have is that the song at the heart of the film, sung to an small audience of fans by someone who must be a well-loved Spanish folk singer, was not subtitled. Considering that it causes Marco to weep, it would have been wonderful to know what the song was about.</fullReview>

She is beautiful, sexually yielding, and doesn't have a functioning brain. In a way, it is like the Stepford Wives, where women are merely sexually attractive robots that do not possess any real intellect or consciousness, and certainly not the ability to refuse sex.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>spoilers: The following events are important to the story, yet they are not seen: Lydia's death, Alicia'a re-awakening, Benigno's suicide and Alicia's child birth and the death of the child. Mr Almodovar should have shown us these events. What we do see are many sequences showing how to care for a person in a coma. These are so gorgeously shot that they have a certain amount of interest, but they do not make for satisfying drama.What is the idea of a coma? What is the interest? It is problematic because people in comas do not talk. That is not very interesting. I thought that maybe the idea was unrequited love, but that theme is not pursued.The black and white sequence is a little bit funny, but it does not seem to relate to the rest of the film. Is the shrinking man somehow equivalent to the two people in a coma? Beats me.Marco is the strong, silent type. Two of the major characters are in comas. None of them talk. Silent people in a drama are problematic. I want to know what they are thinking.I wish that the film had focused more on Lydia. She was unique, and the actor who played her was memorably visual. There could have been less of Alicia. She was bland.Seeing the opening dance sequence did not make me want to rush out to buy tickets to a Pina Bausch concert. I have been to funerals that were more lively.My pal Neil is 100% certain that Benigno was the rapist. I am not so sure. The information is not given with certainty. Marco was interested in Alicia, and he had the opportunity.The happy ending seemed to go against the grain of the events that preceeded it.All About My Mother and Live Flesh were both more engaging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing but not convincing....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beautiful photography, especially the bullfight scene, and some beautiful musical moments. But I failed to empathise with the characters in this film.SPOILERSFor me, Benigno wasn't convincing - was he meant to be a sensitive, caring man (as Almodovar would have us believe) or a callous and ruthless rapist? His actions (if you think about what he actually did) don't fit into the idea of 'love' as we would envisage it - and yet that's what Almodovar is trying to make us believe.In fact, my overriding impression is that Almodovar doesn't actually like women. There's a disturbing cruelty in this film, exemplified for me by the scene where the two men engage in conversation while accompanied by their comatose 'lovers'.And when you think about it, what was the point of having Lydia in the film at all? Merely a device to bring the two male leads together...All in all,a disappointment despite being beautifully made...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almodovar mellowing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having missed Talk to Her when it was shown in the cinemas, I have been watching out for the release of the DVD. Being not fast enough, I ended up getting a VCD which serves almost just as well. But I do miss out on some of the specials features available only in the DVD, including interviews of the four main characters.Another thing the DVD has, as people told me, is a special, separate feature of just the ballad performed somewhere at about the middle of the film, in a scene at the hotel where Marco and Lydia are staying. It's a very familiar tune that everybody will recognize once heard, but I'm sorry I don't have the name. What I want to say it that it is so exquisitely beautifully done that this performance alone is worth the price. But that of course is not the only thing. Throughout the film, we get the beautiful brand of music that comes to be expected of every Alomdovar film.Visually, I found that Almodovar has mellowed somewhat. In Talk to Her, you don't see that angry, glaring red that keeps clashing with evrything else. Instead, there is a subdued red that is almost a glow of orange that blends in with rather than challenges the surrounding.Signs of mellowing has also shown in his general treatment of subject matters. Surely there are controversies that will shock the general mass audience but they will hardly raise an eyebrow in Almodovar connoiseurs (one of which I'm not qualified to be called).Of the incredible creativity, much has been said. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever that the screenplay should not win an Oscar. But then they gave one of those to Russell Crown in Gladiator instead of Richard Farnsworth in The Straight Story, so there you go.Finally, a most wonderful surprise was seeing Geraldine Chaplin, whom I found tantalizingly familiar but failed to recongize, until in the ending credit. It took me even longer to remember that she was Tonya in Doctor Zhivago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sublime and risky- what Hollywood is missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almodovar seems to just get better as time goes on. _Hable con ella_ is my personal favorite of his films so far. It's an absolutely spectacular by Spanish film standards, and pretty darn good when compared with the rest of international cinema. This odd yet undeniably moving meditation on love, loss, gender, and sexuality (or the lack thereof) is exquisitely filmed and told, powered by two very strong characters whose devotion and love for those around them knows no boundaries.Both Marco and Begnino are blessed with an uncanny ability to empathize. The fact that neither of them is afraid to express this gives the audience a rare treat: male protagonists who are refreshing in the sense that they aren't bound by the idiotic and arbitrary cultural and sexual stereotypes of Hollywood. Through this vehicle, the gender of all the film's characters is slowly deconstructed until their humanity becomes the only relevant concern.This is the sort of film we just don't see from Hollywood. Solondz has paved the way for these sorts of stories, but _Hable con ella_ took the concept to a new level by creating a gender neutral romantic drama. Hopefully this should open the way to many more new and interesting films.Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Off-beat but brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pedro Almodovar's "Talk to Her" is especially impressive in its ability to wring realistic drama and emotional truth out of a premise, or series of premises, that are bizarre to say the least. In that regard it's reminiscent of a Charlie Kaufman film, though in fairness, Almodovar has been around much longer than Kaufman. But as with "Being John Malkovich," I sat through most of "Talk to Her" with that wonderful feeling of not having a clue what would happen next. Each plot twist--and there are many--is stranger than the last, yet they are all absolutely true to the characters and story. As the old adage goes, a good ending should be both surprising and inevitable. Almodovar applies this principle not only to the ending of "Talk to Her," but to the entire film. It's a genuine joy to watch and will likely stay with you for a very long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not have much time to delve deep into all of my reasons for not really liking this movie that much. There are way too many, possibly some that I do not even fully understand yet. I will start at the beginning.THERE MAY BE THINGS IN THIS POST THAT REVEAL THE STORY. DO NOT READ BELOW HERE IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE!The dance scenes really did not move me at all, and I do not want anyone to think that I have no culture or that I have an IQ below the internation retardation limit. I used to choreograph shows and I try to understand all sorts of dance movements and pieces.The acting was superb. There was not one time where the whole cast was not totally engrossed in portraying their character. There was not one time where I can say that a movement was weak, an inflection change was unwarranted, a word (even though translated) was out of place.I think that it was the slow build of the movie. It did not grab my attention until the facts started to really pop out about the nurse's infatuation with the patient. I have to admit that I had my suspicions from the onset, and I was glad that I was not far from wrong.The scene with the shrunken lover was great. I love silent films, the exaggerated movements, overseasoned expressions, ragtime music...all of it. The fact is that I would have done the same thing, but I would not have gone down there and "stayed forever".Were you expecting a long rant about how much putrid vileness was in this film? Sorry to not give you what you were expecting. I did not hate the movie, but there was a lot lacking for it to have beat out City of God in my opinion.Ever wonder why they put "THE END" on movies? I have, and last night I realized that this movie was forseen in the stars and they started to do it because they knew that this ending would not really be an ending. The problem comes in where the editors waited for the "fortold movie with no end" to forget to place the "THE END" tag on the actual end. I was expecting so much more. I had not paid attention to how long I was in the theater. It is not like I was the only one that was in there that was not sitting waiting for more. The whole theater was just sitting there like, "Where is the other reel? Put it on. We'll wait!" And it is not that all people in Atlanta are slow either. There is a widely varied cultural mix due to it being a city with tons of international colleges and universities.I guess I am just trying to say that I cannot see how, with its stale rise and fall, how it beat City of God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poetic and sublime film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pedro Almodovar is King!!!This film is nothing short of magic, from the surreal yet mesmerising opening dance scene to the moment the credits begin to roll.Dance, Bull-fighting, cinema and talking are just a small handful of activities that are treated with respect and passion (even the killing of a snake has a balletic feel) but what seperates this film from anything else is the direction.There is not one moment when every element does not gel perfectly, no two directions that things move in. It flows like a fairy-tale piece of cinema, making the audience feel warm, engaged, emotional and, above all else, wanted.The use of colour is like nothing I have ever seen. Almodovar's favorite colours (Blue, Yellow, Green etc) are the only real colours used but their use is so subtle that it is easy not to notice. The best example of this can be seen in the shot where Lydia is walking past the camera in medium close-up with the reflecting water behind her. Genius. This shot is rival to Lean's Omar Sharif coming out of the desert in Lawrence of Arabia. In fact no, to suggest that they should rival each is stripping both of the respect they deserve. (But you can see what I am getting at)Talk to Her seems to be what Almodovar has been building up to all his career. It has the emotion of All about my Mother, a diluted version of Women on the Verge's design and humour, Kika's controversy, and Matador's Bullfighting and Sexiness (as well as Live Flesh's )For an experienced film-maker such as almodovar this is something to be tremendously proud of (not that he needs me to tell him that). This film could not be made by anyone else, although influence can be seen. If this had been made by a first-time director then they would have not been human, but a god...and I would have set up a church in their name</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Pregame: Spanish with English subtitles. I had been expecting a slow, but dramatic and subtley comedic film about two men and their relationships with eacthother and the women they love, who are both in comas.The Game: This film consisted of some pretty weird turns and twist. Almost had an American Beauty quality. Sometimes funny, but much of that was lost on my speaking a different language. Got a little graphic at times, but I can appreciate the intent. Definitely not made for an American mainstream audience.Postgame Report: While the characters were truly unique and had much personality, I never felt able to attach to any of them, because the film never focused enough on either. Also one character does something that I we are supposed to fell sorry for him for, but I was not convinced there was ample reason to side with him. This film takes some risks, and does so with moderate success, despite great acting and what must have been excellent dialogue. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I'm not being amazed by how shoddy and derivative a movieis -- usually Hollywood -- I'm being amazed by how one -- usuallyforeign -- can make the cliche "the unlikeliest of friends" work.This is, thankfully, a case of the latter. Two men meet when thewomen they love end up in comas in the same ward of a hospitalin Spain. One, a writer, is bitter at his bullfighter-girlfriend'sbedside. The other, a nurse, is downright chipper as he takes careof a young ballet dancer.What follows is fascinating, well-written, expertly-acted, and darklycomic. The film is beautifully shot, and should entertain even thosewho dislike "movies where you gotta read."I highly recommend this one. It's worth every penny of admission,and every minute of your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jacques Demy as one of the keys to enter Almodovar's universe of dreamed reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What were Almodovar's thoughts while watching Jacques Demy's "Le Bel Indifferent" (1957) ? Most likely he was repressing himself not to shout "Talk to Her !". In "Talk to Her" (2002) Almodovar welcomes again Jacques Demy's cinematic universe as the day welcomes the sun. "Le Bel Indifferent" or "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (1963) are some of the keys that help us to enter into Almodovar's dreamed reality. "Talk to Her" starts just like "Le Bel Indifferent" with a picture of a theater's curtain raising up followed by Almodovar's personal interpretation of that movie with Marco crying as he recognizes himself as the guy who did not talk to her. Colorfulness, ambiguousness, camera as a nymph dancing through space and time aiming to capture the spirit under the facts, slow movement takes, quiet musical moments, use of subtitles to divide the movie in parts, apparently independent stories (or even movies in the case of Jacques Demy: Marc Michel in "Lola" and "Les parapluies de Cherbourg") that end up crossing each other, pregnancy, charming views of the city: Alcalá St., Príncipe St., ... A list that can be made as long as the film itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>feelings that can´t be expressed through words</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday was the second time i saw the film. As the tape was expiring, I could feel my heart was disminishing as the body of the shrinking lover who appears in the shot within the film. Superb. He has made a movie about men. The last one was about women and feelings. This is about men and the repression of feelings. It make me think about how Almodovar clearly establishes the old break between a world of open feelings related to women and the world of silence and repressed feelings related to men. Is it educational? His main character has to break social conventions in a disgusting way -commiting rape- to finally express what he feels. You could also read another point: women are better when they don´t talk. Relationships go easy as they are mute. This is always from Beningno's point of view.Definetely, everyone must see this marvellous creation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Muy Bien Hecho Pedro Almadovar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night but I wasn't expecting much from it. All I got to say is "Muy bien hecho Pedro Almadovar". You did a good job! Having seen many of his films, I say that this is one of his best work. It started slow, but by the end even I had to shed a tear. I didn't see the relationship between Marco, Benigno and the girls in a coma, at first but now I realized that their lives were intertwined. I don't think that Pedro Almadovar was trying to say that women can live without men, but they were all one people that depended on one another to heal in a positive way. Also that the actions one person can have drastic consequences toward another person and we must not take all of our actions for granted. The movie was ultimately about the sacrifices one does for love and how it's the glue that can help heal or destroy lives between people. This we all have in common.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MASTERPIECE THEATER...REDEFINED!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a movie experience I had last evening, seeing Talk To Her, Almodovar's recent offering for which he is up for a best-director Academy Award.Seeing this fine film, I know why now.It was clearly a masterpiece, masterworks from a master of the craft. The lushness, the richness of the film in color--and black-and-white--lent the film to a fine authenticity which is so badly lacking in many films today. It was as if he redefined the buddy flick genre, taking it somewhere completely different and in an elevated greater direction. Two men, one a nurse, the other a writer, meet up first in a theater during a ballet recital sitting next to each other, only to meet later in a hospital where women they each care deeply about are each in comas fighting for their respective lives. The way Almodovar set this up was a great hand-tipper as to what would be in this one.If I may digress, it was not so much the women being downplayed--they NEVER are in the Almodovar films I have seen--but rather as it is the volume being turned up LOUDLY on the men here. It is male bonding from a different perspective, as the two women they love--one a ballerina with an angelic face, the other a bullfighter with a handsomely androgynous profile framing her female beauty--bring them together unexpectedly. But when they do come together, it is, in itself, a thing of beauty--as the rest of the film itself is.I even enjoyed the B&amp;W silent film in the midst which was very much in keeping of Almodovar's excellence. And the meshing of many art forms--dance, bullfighting, film, writing, photography, music--all draw you in with a presence which has you not only caring about the characters, but also having them stay with you long after the film ends.Whather or not Almodovar will win Best Director remains to be seen as of this writing. However, I shall say this: THIS IS A DOUBLTESS MASTERWORK OF A MASTERPIECE FROM A MASTER DIRECTOR!And I know when that is so: refering to a human being in that vernacular is not something I do with any kind of regularity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as I say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie in which actions tell the story while the words are how characters try to cope. Why is the bullfighter gored when she has just won back her lover? No one explains, though her past and curent lover each blame themselves. However, we have already seen the bullfighter executing death-inviting moves after her breakup. The get-together is very recent. We see her executing another dangerous move. This time the camera moves close and we see her nervousness, a contrast to her earlier nonchalance. No one tells us that the desire to live has caused her death, but that is what is shown.A pregnancy following a statutory rape brings the dancer back from her long-time coma. No one comments, no one moralizes -- indeed, the facts are deliberately hidden from the man who cares most, leading to his suicide. Again, no comment is offered.The talk is featured but we are not asked to identify it as truth. What is shown as true about the reporter is the departure from objective reporting it is involvement, passion, and emotion that is celebrated. Talking is an act, a symbol. The comatose women need to be talked to in order to demonstrate love and care. One dies without it; the other revives when talk is replaced by action.This is a more significant picture for men than for women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Performance used for emotional healing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Talk to Her", the latest work of Spanish filmmaker laureate Pedro Almodovar, displays a mastery of the form so rare in any artistic endeavor: it manages to balance a sense of the medium's history and delicately artful compositions with an engaging character study. Think of it as a love letter to performance; film is used to capture the arts of bullfighting and ballet, and the effect on us attests that performance has the power to vivify.We witness performance exert this power on both Benigno (Javier Camara) and Marco (Dario Grandinetta) in the opening scene, in which the two men, unacquainted but seated beside each other at a dance recital, are unmistakably moved, one to tears. Benigno, as we later discover in the unfolding story, is in attendance because of Alicia (Leonor Watling). She is the young ballet student whom he watched practice at her studio from his apartment across the street, and in short time he developed an infatuation. His career is as a nurse, and when Alicia is brought to the hospital in a coma after a traffic accident, he assumes the role of her caretaker, devoting unusually loving attention to his unresponsive patient. Knowing that she loves silent movies and ballet, he attends both as often as possible, then sits at her bedside to talk to her about them.Marco is not in attendance as a vicarious messenger, but as a man searching for emotion after his heart was hardened by the end of a long relationship. He is a travel writer and tries to get a journalistic interview with Lydia (Rosario Flores), Spain's most famous female bullfighter. She too is coming off a long relationship, and a notorious one, with Spain's premiere male matador. They quickly fall in love, and just as quickly she is gored in a bullfight and placed, near death, in Benigno's hospital.The two men become friends, and Benigno works to convince the tacit Marco that the best thing he can do for Lydia is to care for her as though she is alive and can hear him. Benigno adheres to his philosophy too strongly, while Marco is never so optimistic, but the similarities of their predicaments engender strong bonds. They each have good hearts but troubled minds, and as we grow to know them, we wish we could counsel them and prevent certain inevitable actions.The climax of the story is beautifully realized, but the fulcrum of the movie is the true highlight, an example of the filmmaking that manages to outshine the writing and acting. In this mid-movie scene, Benigno recounts to Alicia the silent film he saw the night before, as he knows she would have liked to. The silent picture is presented in a manner apropos to the early days of cinema, in black and white, a bit too fast and flickering, and with inserted dialogue cards. The story is of a scientist in love - there are some nice touches of "Metropolis" here - who creates a formula that makes him shrink. Unable to reverse the effects, he eventually turns to a sort of ultimate consummation.This scene provides a brilliant metaphor to help us digest the rest of the story, but it also works to elevate the medium of film. It is a reminder that silent film is a type of performance art, one that can convey emotion without the use of overt comments by the performers. Almodovar renders the scenes of bullfighting and ballet equally beautifully, and their interplay with the story is a sublime example of one potential use of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clearly the best movie of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this engrossing movie I tried to dissect it and understand what Almodovar was trying to tell us. I got bogged down and realized that, for me, it's better to go to my emotions on this one. I think when a movie moves me like this, and I still don't get all of it intellectually, that the director has reached me on an unconscious level, like a dream does.This is not a love story about men loving women, rather it is a love story about how these men love the women of their imagination. Benigno never knows Alicia, but he loves how she looks, and he is free to relate to her as he sees fit, without having to deal with any feedback! He is a great but stunted lover!Marco gets to know Lydia, but only really sees her in the light of how he can relate her to his lost love. When she is gone, so is his love for her. But clearly Benigno is the alive one, the passionate one, the man of imagination. This attracts Marco who is unable to get in touch with his own inability to communicate love - even though he is a writer. The blind are leading the blind, but I found I had great sympathy for both of them. Almodovar reached me in my own struggle with communicating love.The music draws one in, as we relate to music on an non intellectual level. I was brought to tears by the song sung in the middle of the movie (to an audience), even though I couldn't understand the words (they are not translated), and again at the end when the movie ends with a lovely hypnotizing dance, and the emphasis is on the cocking twitch of swaying hips. Beauty can be heard and seen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, I thought Pedro Almodóvar must be crazy to combine sex and comatose patients. It was appalling to think of for a few moments, but later you seem to realize how he has portrayed desperation and love in a crude way.Beningo and Marco are two friends who happen to meet by chance and the women they love are both hospitalized in coma. The relationship and lives of the four are shown in varying dimensions of time. Particularly touching is the relationship between Marco and Beningo. The way they both relate to each other's concerns is enchanting. Beningo is portrayed innocently but he proves that he is very serious about his passions.Almodóvar (1999 Academy Award Winner for `Todo sobre mi madre') narrates a tale of love in the lives of two men. This film showcases his mastery in film craftsmanship and like many other of his previous works evokes a multitude of feelings without taking the characters too far. Almodóvar who is known for presenting his characters in a sensitive and honest way does so in this film too and these characters are perfectly unambiguous.Javier Cámara (Beningo) has given an ingenious performance and you can see innocence flowing not only through his speech, but also through his body language. Darío Grandinetti's character is very interesting. He is seen being emotional in many scenes but his expression and personality are rather stoic most of the times. It is easy to be mistaken that Grandinetti has done little to emote effectively, but it has to be understood that his character and personality warrants such restraint in expression. However, his acting is impeccable and heart-warming in the scene he cries for his 'big' loss. I was personally aroused by his performance and maturity.Alberto Iglesias's music is delicate with an appealing Spanish tinge encompassing it. Javier Aguirresarobe's lenses have captured the visuals with adequate light and color that adds poignancy to the theme. Many have described `Talk to Her' as Almodóvar's best. The film also won the `Best foreign Language Film' award at the Golden Globe Awards 2003. It is definitely a film that is worth watching and I hope it inspires many more American movie-goers to patronize more foreign-language films rather than sticking just to the over-rated high budget flicks. A compelling 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Talk to Her" is Pedro Almodovar's bittersweet love letter to the battle of the sexes. In this case, his film depicts 2 men gently and faithfully awaiting the return of their loves from coma. One communicates with her incessantly because he's her attendant, washing and massaging her while he talks. The other is a more manly, taciturn writer who mainly converses in his memory with his maimed girlfriend bullfighter.The women can't hear the men, so they are left alone to weep at the smallest bits of melancholy . These two men could represent the new age of sensitivity where the men now talk but the women can't hear. Because one woman is a bullfighter who was going to leave the writer for her former love anyway, and the other a ballerina who would never connect with her aide anyway, the androgynous issue is covered, perhaps signaling that women don't need men anymore.The sequence about the surreal science fiction film, where a miniaturized man enters his love's vagina, is as shocking and funny a sequence as you will see, even if you revisit the Melies brothers at their wildest. Women are capable of swallowing up men until they are lost in the feminine mystique. No shrews tamed here.Listening seems to be the major metaphor, but as the old joke goes, a man shouting in the forest would still be wrong. It's a provocative Almodovar at his best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pedro Almodovar has never made excuses for the actions of his characters and that is one of many reasons why his films are so interesting. His films are usually about love and how many different levels that love can come from. Even when some of the characters in his films do unspeakable things it is a way of expressing their love. The incredible dream sequence shows a man practically allowing himself to be devoured by what he believes is love. I was so glad to see Geraldine Chaplin in a supporting role. We just don't see enough of her. The performances in Almodovar's films usually have lots of close-ups with lustful and ravaged eyes. I don't think its as good as "All About My Mother" but it certainly is just as daring. That in itself is more than you can ask for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A liberating dance to joy and friendship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We see our lovers as we see films, through eyes that have a unique outlook and perspective based on our ideas about reality and the depth of our experience. Sometimes our love conforms to society's values, often it does not. In Pedro Almodovar's Talk To Her, two very different men visit comatose women in the hospital, and each form a bond with the women and each other. The love is part real, part fantasy, but does not fit our picture of what being "in love" is truly about. Indeed, Almodovar's women often seem like idealized objects of art.Talk To Her is a series of interwoven character studies about the effects of loneliness that is often self-conscious. The film opens with a Pina Bausch dance piece called Café Muller. Two women, dressed only in a pink slip, run across a chair-littered stage with their eyes closed. A man, anticipating her every move, pushes the obstacles out of the way for her. Sitting in the audience is Marco, a man so touched by the performance that tears stream down his face. Next to him is Benigno, a stranger who nevertheless notices Marco's reaction. In fact, it means so much to him that when he returns to his job as a nurse caring for a young woman in a coma, he describes the scene to her. Benigno (Javier Camara) is a somewhat effeminate male nurse who has spent the last four years taking care of the beautiful Alicia (Leonor Watling), in a coma since an automobile accident. Prior to that he spent his adolescence taking care of his sick mother. At 30, he is still a virgin and professes to be gay. Benigno, however, loves Alicia and spends his days and nights talking to her even though there is no evidence of response, a scenario seemingly borrowed from the 1998 film Dreamlife of Angels. Marco (Dario Grandinetti) is a travel writer who has recently ended a long-term relationship because of the woman's drug habit. He meets Spain's only female bullfighter Lydia (Rosario Flores) after watching her on a television interview. Lydia has also ended a relationship with a prominent bullfighter. When a bull inexplicably gores Lydia, she ends up in a coma in the same hospital as Benigno and Alicia. A friendship develops between the two men based on mutual need. Benigno notices Marco and advises him: "A woman's brain is a mystery, and in this state even more so.? Talk to her." The four main characters are very different but compassionate in their own way as shown in flashbacks of their lives: the charming but obsessive nature of Benigno, the idealized beauty of Alicia, and the masculine sensitivity of both Marco and Lydia. Benigno is the central character in the film and is portrayed by Camara as innocent and charming, yet strange in his dark compulsions. Marco, in an outstanding performance by Grandinetti, projects a Clint Eastwood type image of a proud masculine individual but possessed of a deep humanity. Katerina Bilova (Geraldine Chaplin), Alicia's ballet teacher, is another fascinating Almodovar creation. She talks poetically about femininity emerging from masculinity and the earth giving way to the ethereal. Her interest in such physical transformations is indicative of the spiritual bent of the director.The lives of the characters become intertwined in a way that is daring and unpredictable and their story brings us to a level of deep and personal involvement. Though this is the first film I've seen by this director, Almodovar's stock in trade seems to be to shock us into awareness of the outer limits of the human condition. The film presents the biggest challenge to the viewer when Benigno tells Alicia about a silent movie he's seen. It is Almodovar's own creation called The Shrinking Lover, ostensibly a takeoff on the 1957 classic The Incredible Shrinking Man. The story is about a man who keeps shrinking. He keeps trying to make love to a woman but gets so tiny he walks into the woman's vagina and disappears forever. In this sequence, there is a distance that separates men and women and a connection that brings them together. The ensuing plot twists tests the viewer's ability to feel sympathy for Benigno who violates not only the own ethical standards he swore to uphold but the standards by which conduct is judged by society. The question is to what extent Almodovar's attempt to poeticize irresponsible behavior and make it seem innocent and charming heighten our spiritual sensibility, or make us blind to the implications of such acts. In taking us to the limits of what is ethical, plausible, or even physically possible, Almodovar asks for our love and compassion, not our judgment and, rather than a study of pathology, Talk To Her becomes a liberating dance of joy and friendship.</fullReview>

There is a small silent flick with al the elements of a movie belonging to that period. It is a very funny and perverted story that relates to one of the main characters' (Benigno) state of mind. There is also a small live performance by Caetano Veloso. Hi sings a very romantic arrangement of 'Cucurrucucu Paloma'.

		<fullReview>I've let slip in a few other reviews here that I'm a lover of maps. I climb easy to moderate peaks in the southern Sierra Nevada and, invariably, the hours at home with my topos almost overshadow the few minutes atop each summit. Special then, of course, are films with maps, books with them, Robert Louis Stevenson, Defoe, Arthur Ransome, the whole separate volume of maps for Patrick O'Brian, Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars, but also Breton's "Nadja," in which obscure photos "map" either the title character or Breton's perception lain upon her. "Talk to Her" begins with a ballet piece in which a (fictionally, I guess) blind ballerina navigates the stage. At the brink of disaster a stagehand materializes to scatter chairs from her path. No one can watch this without mentally mapping her path. Some viewers may even, involuntarily, map her fall.Benigno, following Alicia just prior to her accident, does a virtual tapdance, himself, amid rushing traffic, as he tries to cross to her. In the hospital, he incessantly explores the surface of her body. We end up knowing this landscape, womanscape better than we do Alicia's person. I could be wrong, but I don't think it ever makes us forget her person. The film's other woman, Lydia, is a map as well, but in her case the map is her face. Fighting bulls isn't outside the potentiality of her character, but in bullfighter garb, the face above that tiny necktie's a world away, a whole other side of the orb, from that of Lydia the social being. She's an experienced fighter. Why does she fall to the very first lunge? The tiny man in the silent film Benigno relates (clearly he also creates it, whether at the instant of telling or some earlier private time) ends up at a cave as mysterious as any in adventure fiction.Benigno's crime (be aware that I write these things mainly for people who've already seen whichever film) simply repeats the tiny man's journey. I'm not sure Almodovar sees it as a crime. As Marco says, Benigno heals and awakens Alicia. The name Almodovar's given him of course means what it sounds like, benign. In the eyes of society, though, it's a crime, perhaps even in the eyes of Alicia, beyond the frame of the film, if Marco can't adequately explain when she inevitably finds out. Yet she's portrayed as such an innocent, such a blank slate, a canvas, a sleeping beauty, it's hard to imagine her blaming him. The prison's real, what the prison, the prison's isolation does to Benigno is real. The crime isn't and is a crime. It doesn't and does exist, didn't and did happen. The child isn't and is. Like the self-directed terrorist in Kieslowski's recent "Heaven," like the protagonist of the Indian film "The Terrorist," like Dostoevski's Myshkin, Benigno's a holy sinner. Much of what he says is true, at least in the way of poetry, at least within the parameters of his own perception and ultimately of Marco's. And much of it's true, at least perhaps, in real world terms. That's why his "silent film" is simultaneously so beauteous and hilarious. In the real world beauty that doesn't mix with the joy of hilarity is something else, something static, not life, not beauty. Marco learns from Benigno and grows, even if fitfully, grows out of his own skin to learn and acquire Benigno's and Alicia's realities.Other touchpoints: the necrophiliac coda in which "A.I.'s" robo-boy resurrects a sentient, cruelly terminal image of his "mother;" "Heaven" not just for what I've already said but also to compare its flight sym landscape to Almodovar's and Benigno's view of Alicia's body; the Japanese film "Turn;" "Solaris," "Solyaris," and the book; "Johnny Got His Gun." I've never really believed in "brain death." Don't ask me to "pull your plug." Don't even consider pulling mine."Talk to Her" sports one of the most watchable trailers ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally! Amazing non-technology breakthrough!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is extraordinary. The characters (Benigno and Marco) are performed in an excellent way. The story is very good (I didn't like "todo sobre mi madre") and (at least for me) not predictable.It's a real contender where movies full of special effects try to steal the spectator's eyes and soul.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD. Of course, Almodóvar is Almodóvar, so you will find one of his typical disturbing scenes at the middle of the movie. It's a black and white film inside the film where a man shrinks and shrinks and... well, you'll see.The ending of the movie resembles somehow to "Romeo and Juliet".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The men are sensitive and deep. The women are brain dead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, what do we learn about relations between men and women from `Talk to her? The men are sensitive, deep, romantic and passionate, prone to grand gestures and self sacrifice. The women?well?at best they are brain dead. Not since `Tie me up tie me down' have we seen such a Bacchanalia of misogyny. Handsome Marco is tough-looking and virile, but his soul is sensitive and generous, and his eyes are often misty. Benigno the devoted nurse would give his life to `join' his comatose love. Yes, he is a simpleton at times, but he is also selfless and has a heart of gold. And the women? Well, those who are not unconscious are either vulgar (like the nurses in the hospital), stupid and gossipy (like the concierge in Benigno's apartment house), or lazy and needy (like Benigno's mother). As to the main female characters, bullfighter Lydia attempts a bold foray into the professional world of men. She pays a very high price for this insolence. First she is ridiculed (she abandons her spacious house on a whim, because? there was a snake in the kitchen; Marco the brave kills it). Then Almodovar put her in coma. Then she dies oh so conveniently, but not before we are told she has betrayed our sensitive and noble Argentinean lover Marco? The other main female protagonist, Alicia, is a ballet dancer. Since the ballet is not a threatening profession to men, Alicia is allowed to rise from the dead. Yet she says and does awfully little once conscious, and was much more expressive and interesting as a corpse than as an awakened human being. In the background we have Katerina the bland (played very adeptly be Geraldine Chaplin), and the shell shocked Pina Bausch dancers, bumping into the walls. These dancers, who set the tone for the whole movie, avoid the chairs and the tables on the dancing stage only with the help of a quick and efficient man? Well, all this is just a little bit unbalanced I'd say?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As usual Mr. Almodovar give us an history from different views, the way all the characters in the movie meet in one history is like his director signature, some people can find this history a little bizarre, but some more with a twist sense of humor can find the ideal man and woman relationship. Great performances from the principal actors, with a friendship almost reaching the homosexuality limits like the Roman Empire army's loyalty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love film. Tonight, I found a new lover in the guise of Pedro Almodovar's "Talk to Her." Not only was my breath repeatedly taken away by the sheer audacity and beauty of this movie, I felt my heart and soul elevated to entirely new heights.I am still in tears as I listen to the music not more than an hour after seeing the movie. The track that gets me is the one that was used on the trailer -- "Raquel" by BAU. Oh my, it is so heartwrenchingly beautiful -- and when I visualize the men and women dancing with each other at the end, the goosebumps come and tears come to my eyes. Yes, just like Marco.I will never watch film again quite the same way. Muchas gracias, Sr. Almodovar. BRAVO!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing social satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen "Talk to Her"(Hable con ella) twice and I'm still not sure what Pedro Almodóvar is up to. I think he's pulling off a magic realism, surrealistic social satire disguised as a straight-forward narrative such that I heard three different versions from audience members in the lobby of what they thought who did what to whom. The images are powerful but are very confusing, including swimming and special effects interludes. It's something about male/female communication (including through music and dance) and something about the power of desire to manipulate people.It's something about two self-deluded men, one a sweet nurse, one a cynical, snake-killing journalist, who totally mis-perceive their relationships with women, one a sweet dancer and the other a flamboyant snake-fearing bullfighter. It's something about parent/child relationships as each character is either living up to or rebelling against his/her own parents or his/her objects-of-desire's parents.  And everybody's talking and nobody's listening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Comas and a Bullfight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Almodovar is always a creative and visual story teller and "Talk To Her" is certainly no exception. Can't say I ever remember seeing a film with TWO of the leads spending most of the movie in a coma, plus scenes from bull fights, ballets and silent films. Javier Camara is superbly creepy as Alicia's caregiver who is desperate for love and friendship. Dario Grandinetti is stunning as Marco whose stoic personality can reach dimensions that most actors never portray. His scenes with Lydia and Benigno are unlike anything ever seen on screen. Geraldine Chaplin ("Dr. Zhivago" and daughter of Sir Charles) has a wonderful turn as the ballet director and friend to Alicia. Almodovar creates a balletic feel to the entire movie - the pacing of the story, each individual scene and even the film score create the feel of watching a ballet. A word to the wise: the faux silent movie within the movie will cause a bit of uneasiness and nervous laughter in the theatre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS ALL OVER ITI'm not exactly an Almodovar fan. I don't like him, I don't like his style, but however I'm bound to recognize that from time to time he delivers a truly great and moving picture. This is one of those.The casting is probably his best up to date. Javier Cámara, Darío Grandinetti, Rosario Flores, Leonor Waitling and specially a small role wonderfully played by Geraldine Chaplin. This would make up for it even if the movie wasn't very good, and it is.It's basically a dramatic comedy (or, even more appropiate, a comic drama) about two lonely men going through the same ordeal, but ít's also a passionate study of friendship and relationships. All of this crafted, if not with subtlety, at least with true emotion and talent. The movie has a lot of high peaks of emotion, and even the most dramatic happenings (like the death of Benigno) don't seem like low punches.A very good movie, then, that I enjoyed a lot and that I'm sure Almodovar fans will love.SAY NO MORE</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After just seeing this great film,I can only comment that I have never seen a film quite like it. As all Almodovar films commence, you go with it, knowing that sooner or later you will understand what is happening and why. Don't worry about it because it all comes together. (no spoilers)I only want to say that Almodovar exhibits feelings of love, as no other director I have ever seen. With his feelings, it makes no matter whether the love is between females, males or comatose women. He just makes it work.My only hope is that no live bulls were really injured in the film. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film experience like "Hable Con Ella" is a spiritual one, that reaches through both Almodovar's and our own imagination to the very heart of being human and at the same time rising to a transcendence that's usually reserved for life's most sublime moments.Retelling the "plot" is unnecessary here (much has already been written). The effectiveness of this movie reached me at the depth it did, not only through the writing, the visual images and performances, per se, but most profoundly through the symbolic nature of the material...that makes it expansive, universal. In any language it can touch and inspire anyone living on this planet...like hearing Mozart, or seeing a Rembrandt or a Hiroshige. Art is art in any medium...and this is a masterpiece!Thank you Sr. Almodovar and all who were involved in this magnificent work!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>100% beautiful, 100% wise, 100% sensuous. 100% Almadovar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last line of the titles ran into offscreen, the lights still dim. The film theater still packed. It took a spare minute to awake from the movie, that broke into gasp of excitement and overwhelming joy. We just finished watching `Talk to her' - the latest release from Spanish film director Pedro Almadovar.This is a known fact that in film business one's success is not entirely a success until we see one's next film, so Almadovar was in grave danger after releasing such a great film like `All About My Mother', since we thought that was the top of it all. `Talk To Her' appeared to be nonetheless truly amazing. The adequate to Almadovar colors (green on orange, juicy red clothes ect.) fill the screen many times once again to connect our senses and subconsciously tell us one more story about the colorful characters. A bull fighter (a woman - therefore an outcast, in Spain), a male nurse (who everybody think is gay, so treat him as an outcast) and a gentle travel atlas writer. And Alicia. The beautiful sleeping beauty which rises the waves and storms even while at her everlasting sleep.As to me, Almadovar grew up. It seems like, for a spare second, he forgot all the queens and transexuals that get sexually engaged with women who get pregnant and sometimes get AIDS from them, from mothers who envy their daughters for their own lovers, of too much passionate desire to love until some bruises and shades of blue appear on the lover's flesh. Something clicked in his head this time, and suddenly he has realized that soft and nice love lives here too. A love that brings hope and smile right bloody now. Not tomorrow or whenever. No more fights for it, but the people who live their love every single second and enjoy it as long as it still glows at them.This movie was a guide to many lovers who seek their way to know how to love. How to forgive and live with our fears and hidden emotions. And how it all breaks loose if we bury all this in our tummy.I knew the movie would have a superb resolution, however, never that superb as it was. I was dearly surprised for good. Almadovar told us one more story we know too well to tell it to us once more. He trusted one single line on the screen would just do to conjure the magic of that story. And then, we left the theater relieved and happy, sad and smiling, knowing we saw an important movie now and that every day counts. Even if we are an outcast. Even if she is a female bull-fighter and he is a writer.Even if its about ` Marco &amp; Alicia `As if for these who haven't watched this piece and who will sit at theaters in short while I want to wish you to hold your hands tight now. Because as the music by Alberto Iglesias will fill your ears and the titles will roll you'll read these lines : Pedro and Augustin Almadovar Present, A movie by Pedro Almadovar. Hable Con Ella. Talk To Her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almodovar Scores With a New Level of Universality and Empathy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pedro Almodovar isn't the filmmaker for all who appreciate art films and even in Spain he is not infrequently disparaged. Much of the attention directed to some of his previous films has been based upon his unsentimental but emotionally deep ability to explore and bring to the screen the conflicts and hopes - and tragedies - of female protagonists."Talk to Her" is a leap forward for Almodovar in that he both firmly places his story in Spain while bringing forth the interlocking lives of two men and two women in a taut drama with a dollop of comedy and very little cultural regionalism.I'd better explain that since most who follow film know that Lydia, one of the two women, is a bullfighter, a female in a traditional man's role in one of the few countries to exalt this "sport" (quotation marks reflect my bias). While Lydia is shown dressing for the ring in an almost balletic fashion and what happens in the ring is part of the setting for the story, actually what Almodovar develops is extrinsic of her occupation. She could have been a cab driver in Madrid or a lawyer or whatever.Without venturing into the dread world of "Spoilers" both Lydia and the beautiful young Alicia are in a coma in the same hospital. Both are diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state, a condition that is truly death within life.Alicia is the responsibility of nurse Benigno who previous to her coma-inducing accident had met the young woman twice, once under inappropriate circumstances. He adores his unconscious patient. Marco, who was deeply albeit briefly involved with Lydia, is a writer of travel books stunned and depressed by what he knows is the effective end of a two-way relationship. A friendship develops between the men and their attempts to deal with their own feelings are reflections of the way in which they view the two women, indeed women in general.Many will be disturbed by suggestions of an erotic attraction to women who are comatose. The threat of exploitation springs to mind. Almodovar asks the viewer to understand the depth of love, and its possible consequences, without being judgmental. That isn't easy to do.Director/writer Almodovar lets his story unfold without the sharp turns and jolting acts that characterize his previous film work. He has reached a deeper level of sensitivity about the human condition and that's what makes "Talk to Her" a very worthwhile film.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>******Possible Spoilers*******I'm not going to bore people with another review of this movie, every other review hits the nail on the head, it's a beautifully shot and well acted (well maybe not Marco) movie with a couple of genuinely funny moments...But I did have some problems with the ideas behind the movie, I've read narlak's review where he says maybe it's Marco who raped Alicia and I feel people are totally missing the point here.Yes he hints at it being Marco in a Red Herring - Who dunnit kind of way, but I genuinely feel that he shows Benigno is responsible when we see him in Prison, his obsession is boarding on Psychotic! And When we expect him to show some remorse for what he has done, he just gets angry and frustrated that he cant find out about Alicia and the baby, okay when he mentions that the baby could have harmed her he shows a tiny bit of regret but this seems more at the fact that he might not see her rather than the atrocious act he's committed. This is where you know it's him, he's a grown man and obviously knows about the birds and the bees, and if he didn't rape her SURELY he would contest his innocence after making a reference to the baby. For me, it becomes a bit unbelievable that Marco could remain friends with him after this (unless maybe narlak was right and he committed the same horrible deed...), either way I found the subject matter left a bitter taste in my mouth, I wouldn't mind if the subject matter was even portrayed humorously but to romanticise such a horrible act (rape is sick enough but while the person is in a coma is just unspeakably foul) or even to just romanticise stalking was a bit too much for me to swallow...I would recommend this film as a nice piece of Art (Beautiful to watch, I even loved the Shrinking Lover scene) but as far as what he trying to say I hope I missed something....7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sublime necrophilia.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSPedro Almodóvar's `Hable con ella' (`Talk to Her') would be worth seeing if only for the chance to watch and hear the silky voiced Brazilian, Caetano Veloso, deliver a suavely wonderful song halfway through. But there are other pleasures. Almodóvar's cinematography has never been more handsome, and his plot construction has never been neater. What it all adds up to is anybody's guess, but the craftsmanship gives a kind of endless sensual delight. Everything is exceptionally glossy and perfect looking in this movie. Almodóvar delights in bright colors and a look of hyper-real cleanness. The odd Spaniard is at the top of his game and one doesn't have to be a fan to enjoy and admire this one. Many of the familiar themes are there: the man of uncertain sexuality obsessed by his mother; sexuality; fetishism; accidents; hospitals; bullfights; death.We begin with the lovingly photographed finale of a strange balletic opera about somnambulism, during which two strangers happen to be sitting next to each other in the audience, one man watching admiringly as the other weeps. The admiring watcher turns out to be Benigno (Javier Cámara), and the sensitive weeper is Marco Zualago (Darío Grandinetti). It's Almodóvar's conceit that these two men linked at first only by their mutual interest in this campy stage performance are to become involved more and more deeply as the movie progresses.At the heart of the story is an implausible sequence of events. Benigno's previous contact with women has come exclusively through his caring for his mother for many years at home. Now he is a nurse in a clinic where several women lie in comas and he lovingly cares for one of them, Alicia (Leonor Watling), eventually falling in love with her and - absurdly -- wanting to marry her, though she still remains in a vegetative state. He previously had watched her training in a ballet school across the street from his house and witnessed the accident that sent her to the clinic -- another far-fetched coincidence. Implausibly, Lucia is eventually discovered to be pregnant and Benigno is jailed for raping her in the hospital. Childbirth brings her out of the coma, though the baby dies, and she eventually returns to the ballet school, but by this time Benigno is in prison - a sophisticated modern prison of the country club type - and he remains tragically unaware of the positive outcome his transgression has brought about.The two men become friends because Marco comes to the clinic to attend upon another woman in a coma, a female bullfighter, whose lover he had become, though she continued to be fatalistically obsessed by a caddish former lover and was gored as a result of a suicidal gesture of going down on her knees before the bull even came into the ring. All this we witness, telegraphed to us in scenes of bright hyper-reality. Though Almodóvar coyly suggests otherwise, there is something unmistakably gay about both Marco and Benigno, and particularly Benigno. Marco is seen as macho, but we aren't fooled. After all, he is the one who was crying. It's his girlfriend the bullfighter who was the one with the cojones. At the end Marco and Benigno's greatest bond is with each other. The director plays with gay masks, which must particularly have to be worn in his macho, Catholic country.In keeping with the glossy, heightened visual style, everything about this movie is completely operatic. As a viewer, one correspondingly feels compelled to remain rapt and passive. One simply has to watch the whole business unfold and willingly suspend disbelief. One enters into Almodóvar's peculiar and distinctive world, a world that is very Spanish and very gay, very stylized and elegant, and often very bizarre. The film's persistent image is of Benigno bathing and massaging Alicia's beautiful, inert body, which he does with great patience, love, and art. Is this perfect love, as he believes? Benigno's attitude is both monk-like and sensual. Eventually he loses his cool, but we don't see that actually happen, and everything is handled with the ultimate in taste and restraint.The fetishism of Bu?uel is reborn in Almodóvar. The nurse's obsessive care for his unconscious patient is fetishistic, and so is the dressing of the female bullfighter, a quintessentially Spanish ritual which Almodóvar has beautifully filmed. Benigno's obsession with Alicia is inspired by a silent film, `The Shrinking Lover,' in which a tiny man makes love to a normal sized woman by entering her vagina. This black and white film depicting a fetishized man and a fetishized giant female body is exquisitely invented by Almodóvar. `Hable con ella' is beautiful filmmaking at every point.But the whole story, like Benigno's life, shows a strange detachment from reality. Benigno, as his name implies, is benign, harmless - or at least well meaning. But his disconnectedness from reality proves dangerous, punishable. It is odd how the movie celebrates this slightly mad man, yet it does, and the actor, Javier Cámara - self possessed, methodical, overstuffed, a little eunuch-like, yet discreetly sexual - is ideal and compelling in the role. Dario Grandinetti as Marco is somewhat less satisfying. His machismo is unconvincing. He seems too consciously to be modeling his studiedly casual outfits, and his fascination with the prima donna bullfighter is covertly camp. Geraldine Chaplin does an elegant turn as the Martha Graham-like ballet teacher of Alicia, the dancer in a coma.One leaves `Talk to Her' feeling refreshed and calmed because Almodóvar takes us with such assurance and delicacy through his peculiar, exquisite world. He has unmistakably undergone a marked evolution since his 1988 `Mujeres al borde di un ataque de nervios' (`Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,') and similar entertaining follies. This is a restrained, serene, rather hypnotic film, a more mature and self assured work than anything that has come before. One is still left with a sense of puzzlement, of possible pointlessness, but one has been taken to a very special place, where one feels there may, in time, be something important to be learned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Photography you can feel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen most of Almodovar's movies up to "High Heels," but none since. I wasn't prepared for the leap he's made - "Talk to Her" has a depth of emotion and empathy I didn't think he was capable of. His senses of humor and color are present, though muted - they flow from, rather than impose themselves on, the characters.I was most impressed by the tactile quality of the photography, especially of the fabrics. I could almost feel the hospital sheets and the ties of Alicia's gown; the brocade and velvet of Lydia's toreador outfit; the silks of the dancers' slips... I can't recall ever getting that sort of a sensation from a film."Talk to Her" is, like Almodovar's earlier movies, sensuous, defiantly politically incorrect, and curious about love and desire in all their manifestations. This time, though, there's a stillness and emotional richness that bring the work to another level. I'm certainly going to catch up on his mid-to-late 90s work, starting with "All About My Mother," to find out how he got from there to here.</fullReview>

It seems to be about repressed emotions, about people finding unconventional ways to find emotional fulfillment rather than running around - in a focused and driven fashion - getting what they want. The European feel was refreshing, the acting superb. I was happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A completely new angle on the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Potential Spoiler)Like some of the reviewers, I found that there was a vociferous post-film debate between me and my friends after 'Talk to Her'. Besides the obvious interpretation of the movie's plot, I saw a slightly more complex story, and a darker one, that Almodovar may have sought to hide within the more acceptable tale of two men and their feelings two different women.Without ado, I believe that the alternative plot could be one in which Marco (who is involved with Lydia) rapes Alicia in a moment of desperate loneliness, brought on by:a) The loss of his former lover, Angela, to another man. Marco obviously has not gotten over her.b) The loss of Lydia to her former lover (the bullfighter), Lydia for whom he was beginning to have feelings.c) The fact that in the clinic where Lydia lay comatose, there was also a young woman, Alicia, in the next room. This room was always open to visitors, Alicia was often left there alone, and often, the movie suggests, naked.I know, I know, like some of my friends who saw the film with me, many of you will probably think this is an unrealistic spin on the story, but if you think carefully (or better still, go back to watch the film a second time), you will find that Almodovar drops several clues here and there to suggest to alert viewers that Marco's role is more than just that of a loyal friend to Benigno. These clues include: Marco insinuating to Benigno that Alicia may like him too (when talking to Benigno just after getting into a car), Marco expressing strong emotion towards Alicia several times when seeing her lying comatose in the clinic, and several times towards the end of the film, and most tellingly, the title 'Marco Y Alicia' in bold red, at the end of the film- wherein Almodovar seems to be suggesting that this punchline has been coming to a slow boil all through the movie. Finally, what seems convincing about this alternative plot line is that (as pointed out by another reviewer) otherwise it looks like Almodovar is in some sense condoning rape by providing the emotional backdrop to it (in terms of Benigno's psyche). I think Almodovar is too great and too subtle a directorial genius to do something like that. Think about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What was its meaning?To make strong feelings,as in many previous films?No I don't think so.I believe that Almodovar wanted to capture an unusual theme,as he usually does,and make it more reasonable.How many of us have the chance to speak with people in coma?I believed just few but recently I realized that this is not true.I know many people,most of them old,that due to cerebral atrophy or "absence" do not speak and do not understand a thing.Their prognosis is usually poor.Who takes care of them?The people who used to love them.(or ?)Anyway!The position is "hable con ellos".Another point is how many of us fall in love with people in a coma and do never get bored of the situation?I don't think that there are enough.So that theme is rather unreasonable.But for a guy without a life this may be a chance to live again and learn the true love .And he does until he has a reason to live.Then he dies.So that may make sense. Now if someone wants to see the artistic point of the pellicula what can I say?We know Pedro's previous jobs.We know the colors,the setting,the cinematography,the editing and the music.Now they all seem good,although they have change a little bit,but why did I feel sometimes that there are some points that do not fit?Mujeres did not make me that sense.The Tacones either.If I wanted to summarize I could say that in this film there are not many things that are "that's enough" and this is positive.But it need something more to call it a masterpiece.</fullReview>

I was blissfully happy on the way home yesterday, digesting a few gin tonics and haunted by the incredible soundtrack.Then again, tipsy enthusiasm, however intense, so often doesn't survive the hangover. Isn't Benigno a little... weird? Sure, if he wasn't, it wouldn't be Almodovar, but... gentle reader, I put it to you: In the cold grey light of an unforgiving morning, what is this magnificent movie but yet another proof of the fact that men love women who don't talk back? And what, pray, does that tell us about love? Love, indeed.But forgive me for grumbling, Maestro, and keep them coming. I'm sure "Hable con ella" will regain its goofy magic after a shower and breakfast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As almost all Almodovar movies, his latest is intelligent, sensible, and especially different. You can find inside a couple of love stories, and as you may expect, they are not the usual romantic stuff. The film haunts you after you leave the theater, the story line is simple and complex at the same time, and day-to-day acts, as well as extreme one find together their way in an intimate combination. The fantastic plan is represented here by quotes from other art fields - mute cinema, dance, corida (ask Spaniards if you need confirmation that such an art exists). If you love good cinema, and appreciate other genres than Hollywood romances and action, go and see this movie. Among the treats that await you you can find the most unbelievable sex scene in the history of the cinema, and the most famous pair of eyes in the history of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monologues to your mind - A must see film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to stress the fact that I have never been a big fan of Pedro Almodovar, even recognising that his films have a lot of artistic value.This is for me a big exception, since the first scene, where a play of "Caf? Mueller" is shown in a theatre you start to breath this magic atmosphere which follows you in the whole film, is like an existential path to your mind. A "cult" and very intellectual movie, shot in a sort of "sweet" flashback, with lives that get -by chance- together and some clear characters with a "torera" side story that gives the leitmotiv to the whole film. A nice story about lives that want to find an outburst. Almodovar has some personal touch like the black &amp; white scene of the film seen by Benigno (the male nurse), full of symbols, which hardly will be forgotten. A "must see" filmRating: 7/10</fullReview>

Both a woman gave the child who saved the world and a man can give the child saving a woman. And this is not religion, it's a true fact. The plot is based on a true story, about a man that took advantage of coma of the girl he was nursing. And she woke up at child birth. It was a grotesque miracle. A delicate Almodovar makes us believe that it's proof that man and woman cannot offend each other, even if they leave. But one can save the other, because of their nature.I know, It's dreamy. But when you see this movie you feel you can believe in it, at least for a while. And then it makes you feel in peace and faithful. It's one of the sweetest illusion I've ever seen.

		<fullReview>With "Hable con ella" Almodovar seems to have reached the peak of his personal style. Most traces of his trade mark camp humour have been almost entirely eradicated and we seems to be invited to penetrate a more humane, less acid private world of his own. We do this however with some trepidation.On the surface he is, like in his most recent films, telling a story. But his concerns are more to do with story telling as a genre, his interest being more the knots that link the characters and the "texture" of the narrative. He manages to make us believe every twist and turn of a plot that becomes almost entirely unbelievable by the minute but that we can not resist to care about whilst we watch. And we watch in amazement and at the edge of our seat. And this care turns into deep emotions. Sometimes subtle, others quite crude the nuances and unpredictability of the storyline make us drop our cynicism, stirring our sensitive nerve and leaving us unable to rationally control our reaction.It is here that Almodovar carries the torch of the Hollywood melodrama of the 40's and gets even closer to the Latino soap opera, the "telenovela", present in the popular cultural of every Spanish speaking country since TV created them in the early 60's."Hable con ella" focuses, unusually for him, on two male characters but it is really about sexual roles in a wider sense and here Almodovar attitude is subversive. No one is quite what it supposes to be. Men are sensitive, they cry, they are givers, they care and look after others, they are abandoned, they are faithful and loyal to the point of passivity. Women are more complex and fill either a traditional men role par excellence, the torero, the macho bullfighter, or they transcend an ethereal, spiritual quality that transform them from sensitive dancers into sleeping beauties and mothers-to-be.In his world men are confuse not quite knowing how to be able to determine their real roles in life or how to be in control. The short silent "film within a film" is, in this particular context, quite revealing. Closer to the surreal spirit of Bu?uel &amp; Dalî's L'Age d'Or rather than Grifith or Pabst, the ingredients of the fantasy exposes both men characters more frightening feelings of inadequacy and castration. Textbook psychology but also basic Almodovar's theory of life. In the film men are reunited amongst them, their friendship and support of each other their main strength and most valuable asset. But in Almodovar's world are women who continue to be on top even when in a state of coma and, this time, not just on the verge of a nervous breakdown.That is in fact, men's stuff.</fullReview>

Through a very exceptional case (though an absolutely realistic one, you will think you've once read about such a case in newspapers) and a more commonplace one, Almodovar makes some basic questions comparing love with devotion, guilt with salvation, melancholy with feeling like starting afresh.There is much sorrow in the movie, and in my opinion Almodovar lingered a bit on it, but the end is very positive. Some shakespearean reminiscence could be evoked, but only if you want to cut a rich figure with your mother-in-law.The narrative stream is very good, he just does not need fast times to keep the audience.The soundtrack is good, with a gem by Caetano Veloso.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if I enjoyed ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER and LIVE FLESH; I had the feeling that Almodovar was steam and creativity. The dark humor and absence of logic of this best films (WOMEN ON A VERGE OF ?, WHAT I HAVE DONE TO DESERVE THIS, MATADOR and TIE ME UP) were almost absent in his last three or four movies.HIGH HEELS, THE FLOWER OF MY SECRETS and KIKA were far form his previous works and seemed concerned about American culture acceptance (sexuality, madness and OFFENSIVE LIMIT below an `R' rating limit).It is disappointing when somebody you considered a genius, is corrupted by commercial (read U.S.A. ) success.I am really sad to say, that this is still true for his last film `TALK TO HER', but at least he learned how to work near the limit. There is no `humor' in this movie. Erotism is kept on the suggestion level (or just the necessary nudity). Only the shrinking man entering the vagina could be considered audacious; but it is only hiding something worse happening in the movie.But these movie has the most unbelievable love story ever conceived. It is a terrible statement about loneliness and also about what is MORAL or not. Yes; this movies dares to show that the immorality of a rape is only a matter of view. And succeeds in that.The performances are superb except JAVIER CAMARA who is even better. I am not quite sure what Geraldine Chaplin was doing there but at least does not bother.Again, this is a different taste of Almodovar; but it is quite good and worth recommending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first film after "all about my mother", which won the Oscars a couple years ago. It's pretty different from other films directed by Pedro. Instead on focusing on the actresses, Pedro decides to choose a film where actors are essential. He tries to build and show a relationship between two men. Not sex. Only friendship, maybe love. But not sex. Both Javier Camara and Dario Sanguinetti give perfect performances, but sometimes the film "stops" in sub-plots or sub-stories that might lose some of the basic one. This is maybe the lack of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was Killing Six Bulls Really Necessary?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almodovar's 'Todo Sobre Mi Madre' is among my all time favourite films. I liked 'Volver' but did not like 'La Mala Educacion' and 'Carne Tremula so much'. My reason for avoiding 'Hable Con Ella' was the fact that he tortured six bulls to death for one sequence and it wasn't even necessary. This may sound odd and silly to some but I think a movie can be made without killing. Moreover bullfighting should be globally banned.For research purposes, I watched it last night and I would have liked it if it weren't for the aforementioned factor. It's a well made movie with terrific cinematography, editing, special effects, music and lighting. There's a whimsical feel to the story and I liked the use of metaphors, symbolism and details. Among my favourite sequences are the ones that include 'the silent film', Benigno talking to coma ridden Alicia and the dialogue between Benigno and Marco.'Hable Con Ella' boasts of some superb performances. Javier Cámara is amazing. One can easily relate to this character and sympathize for him. Even after doing a despicable act, one sees him as a human and knows that Benigno is a good soul. Darío Grandinetti is good too in a subtle performance. His Marco is very much the opposite of Benigno but at the same time they do have a few things in common that leads to a friendship. Leonor Watling does a fine job and there is a host of familiar faces (like Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Elena Anaya, Lola Due?as, Paz Vega, Fele Martinez etc) doing cameos.It's quite a nice film if you can ignore the 'torture to death' factor. I might have liked it but even so, in my opinion, 'Todo Sobre Mi Madre' remains Almodovar's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HABLE ? is a lovable film, hugely exciting, touching, funny and wonderfully paced; one of the ten best movies of the decade, also. Unafraid of the primal, the shocking, the embarrassing, the visceral, the earthly and the ambiguous, Almodóvar explores unconventional themes in provocative movies. His works are richly themed, and the subjects are ingeniously explored. They shock deliberately, they provoke and bring in discussion subjects of perhaps gruesome sexuality sometimes bordering on kitsch. Here the primal and the larval are multiply represented?by the idiocy, the coma, the sexual abuse, the _corrida, the silent movie seen by Benigno, even the snake. On the other hand, Almodóvar, who's a leftist, an anti?Christian, fights hypocrisy and promotes openness, frankness, annexing as well the residual theme of the Christian decadence. Almodóvar also takes much interest in the _aestheticizing of the life, in a pleasant spirit reminding trends of the popular culture; hence his melodrama/ kitsch bent.You like Almodóvar? Me too. So, let's follow on. In a chaotic, intuitive and partial way, Almodóvar's vaguely visionary movies tend towards the larval, the preconscious and the _pulsional, the subliminal, the uncreated, the hidden, the unformed, the ambiguous, and he succeeds in reaching this meaningful and mysterious layer of inner realities that are most often suppressed; conventionally, such impulses must take the form of the perversion, of the bizarre and the eerie, the monstrous and the disintegrated. In HABLE ?, coma proves fertile, the sexual abuse proves not only handy or understandable, but fertile; idiocy proves salutary and charitable. In visual images, this impulse of Almodóvar takes the mysterious form of the return in the vagina. The vagina becomes the reality of the primal and of the elemental appeal of the mysterious and fertile substance of the life. Almodóvar, an optimist, sees life as infinitely fecund?life springs from coma, from idiocy, from the rejected life, from abuse and taking advantage of a comatose woman. In Brass, the coitus with a sleeping woman is the sign of decadence and nearing death, of self?destruction. In Almodóvar, life is fecund and ample even on its lowest levels, even in the most impossible idyll?that of an imbecile with a comatose patient. What makes HABLE ? so exciting is Almodóvar's paradoxical good sense and cheerfulness?his melodrama is sprinkled with funny moments, as when the salutary rapist informs his friend the journalist that he thinks about him 'mostly during the night'. 'Why during the night?'?almost jumps Zuloaga, who is quite uncertain about his friend's real sexual orientation. As macabre humor, during all his lonely and short life, Benigno made sex only with a comatose patient. Yet Almodóvar prefers to affirm the positive side of this creepy situation?the direst sexual perversion proves healing and is thus on the side of life. On one hand, this might prove Almodóvar's deep illness and the complete loss of any sense of the wrong, his complete depravity; on the other hand though, it shows him plumbing daringly those hideous aspects of the aberration, driven by an instinct of the ambiguity of life's deepest or humblest layers. Almodóvar is surely a disconcerting artist. What I have found to be particularly balancing is his fundamental sense of the real life; or, the way in which, in the script, the idiot's clinical competence, his expertise in nursing is balanced by what would be the most plausible?wild sexual abuse. HABLE CON ELLA, a good, perhaps even amazing movie, stylistically exquisite, with a nice script and huge emotional force, a first?rate melodrama, might be also his best film that I am aware of; on the face or it, HABLE ? seems like almanac sensationalism, yet the provocative tale delves into deeper layers. The level of the anti?Catholic rant, gay _fandom and casualness is completed by the intuition of deeper realities.The performances in HABLE ? are beautiful. In Almodóvar, the attention to the wardrobes, the clothes, directs in fact the attention to the bodies, his lines and cleanness. And HABLE ? is full to the brim with _aestheticized bodily beauty. Clothes and bodies. See that wonderful _torero outfit. This dazzling level of clothes and bodies?sport clothes, _torero clothes, sturdy bodies, naked comatose bodies?serves to disclose another level?those inspirations from the preconscious and unconscious received greedily by master Almodóvar. Don't take for granted Almodóvar's coma physiology. It's symbolic, movie physiology. In Almodóvar' or Tarantino's fancy medicine, a patient in coma is like a puppet; in real life, the body is deteriorated, eroded by the degrading quasi?life. The shrink's daughter, 'Alicia', represents a medical case as much as Uma Thurman did in KILL BILL. For Almodóvar, in his facetiously affirmative vision, Alicia's inert body is fertile, is able to bring fruit. She stays on this side of the life. The babe who plays Alicia is a remarkable beauty. Here Almodóvar, an accomplished nurse, delves deeply into feminine genital hygiene, and then into a simplified genital anatomy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generally interesting character piece looking at love and friendships as those around suffer physically and mentally.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would seem only Almodóvar could get away with this sort of material; this sort of material that sees two women lying comatose for almost the entire piece, but practically shifts all the focus onto two respective men and THEIR pain that THEY go through. But Almodóvar injects a certain amount of substance, raw emotion and character study on top of a few other quirky tid-bits to keep if from coming across as the seriously misjudged and leery piece it might have done in the hands of someone 'lesser'. As it happens, 2002's Talk to Her jumps from perhaps a rather deliberate and un-cinematic soap opera feel; to romance; to tragedy; to surrealism and even finds time to weave its way into a passage that sees it look at the notion of adopting certain spooky, stalker-like characteristics within one of its characters.Talk to Her carries all of the very best of a character driven piece complete with romantic sensibilities, but I found it slightly wavy and inconsistent in tone; cute and quaint subtitles telling us whose relationship we're to follow for the next thirty or so minutes are thrown in amongst what does feel like a creepy relationship between doctor and patient, at least initially. Almodóvar's playing with gender convention in Talk to Her is the first instance he;s having fun. His casting of a woman in the role of the strong and hard-bodied bullfighter, which you'd expect to attribute with a male stands in direct comparison to that of the effeminate, softly spoken male nurse whose role you might assume would be played by a female; indeed all his co-workers are women, put across in a very distinct scene in which all of them sit around a table with coffee, gossipping about relationships and so fourth in the clichéd manner we might assume to see.The male nurse is Benigno Martín (Cámara), a man charged with looking after ballerina Alicia (Watling), following her slipping into a comatose state. What's more is, they have a history. The bullfighter is Lydia (Flores), a woman who has become increasingly romantically linked to Argentinian tourism guide writer Marco Zuluaga (Grandinetti), over a brief period when a chance encounter involving a snake in her kitchen led them to spend more time together. She has recently been gored during one of her bull fighting shows and lies in the same clinic that both Benigno works and Alicia rests.Almodóvar begins and concludes the film in the same location, that being a performance hall or theatre during a play. It would seem Marco is the protagonist of the piece, because he inhabits these spaces at both times, but shares the space with two different people at the beginning and finale. But I'm not sure Talk to Her resembles much a circular journey; although Almodóvar himself might realise this and be playing the wrong card deliberately. Whatever lessons or teachings the characters learn in Talk to Her were either already instilled within them prior to the beginning of this tale or the character's are no longer within the text to put new beliefs into practise.Again, Almodóvar, perhaps deliberately, blurs the lines between whose story Talk to Her's is; focusing on Benigno more than he does any of the other three and developing him from one thing to another. As Talk to Her delves into the past to explore his relationship with Alicia, it appears his apartment above her dance studio offers the perfect chance to watch her perform. But Almodóvar doesn't have him gaze at her, indeed when the perfect time arises and we see her from his window, the camera refuses to display his raw reaction and instead cuts to a long-ish shot of the room he's standing in, nicely capturing the empty and lacking life he leads and emotions that he possesses.Alicia's comatose state sees her immobile apart from by way of wheelchair, but is continuously out for the count. Despite this, her presence or 'character' is able to further the development of those around her. There are points in which Benigno, complete with hot water and sponges, must wash Alicia with another female employee of the clinic; her perfectly still, symmetrical and soft bodied form captures the attention of the camera and no doubt Benigno's as well for which it may double up as.When Benigno shares Alicia's company, there is enough of a retaining of normality as he progresses conversations of a high art nature about trips to watch plays so that when these scenes of Alcici's distinct vulnerability come around, the sequences are not so much creepy in their initial coming around as much as they are mere tests for the individual. How the relationship unfolds is to be seen, but the above passages of interaction serve as a means of telling us Benigno can resist when he wants to. Almodóvar doesn't actually show us any wrong doing between the two, which adds to the mystery of the film and what transpires, but the false sense of security and sense of cheating us out of thinking someone is one thing is still there.On the other hand, Marco is the lynch-pin around which the film revolves; as people are changing from conscious to unconscious and back the other way, Marco retains the same physical and mental state throughout. His relationship with Lydia is unspectacular and even formulaic, but deliberately so. His character will move, physically, much more than anyone else; he will feel what the audience feel and give off the same emotions that we, as a collective audience, are expected by the text to give off at various stages in the piece. The title of the film is Talk to Her, and it is on very rare occasions that such a statement or action is so minute or unspectacular that it actually leads to larger and more spectacular things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benigno is Almodovar's masterpiece in this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almodovar reminds me of Hitchcock. His thrilling plot with a point of British humor, and his maniacal perfectionism as well as the overall mise en scene. However, the dark and psychological themes hold a Fritz Lang feel to them, although Lang usually only really explored them visually. In other words, thank goodness for Almodovar, who is carrying on the film noir banner in the whole world.The only problem with this band is the problem that shows up in a lot of movies by Pedro, it takes its time on minor things that don't really interest us. As well as that, the side plot of the love story between bullfighter Lydia and Marco is unfitting, just like the friendship between Benigno and Marco is not shown very well, because they don't really look like great friends, even though towards the end Marco comes to his rescue. Perhaps it is because Almodovar does not want to distract us from his latest masterpiece: the character of Benigno. It is such an elaborate character that hides loneliness, love and obsession. His love for Alicia is a visceral one, an insane obsession. The only two women in his life have been the ones he has taken care of. His love is so strong that it drives him to an insane gesture that will compromise him.The whole relationship between Benigno and the comatose Alicia is shown well. She is completely vulnerable, but we feel happy that Benigno is taking care of her, because he is such a nice guy. We even suspect he is homosexual, until we realize that he is in love with Alicia. It's a film with many layers, many of which won't even be uncovered, but will have to be imagined. It moves a little slow, but it's still quite enjoyable, the sort of European film that still give the continent its respectability in therms of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talk to Her</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hable con ella / Talk to Her, less shrill, more quiet, deals with the unfulfilled yearning, the destructive power of passion and the loneliness of love, with a great subtle theme on the role of the genders, the Spanish society and the belief in miracles.It's a film about love and death, the new and the old mythology. Journalist Marco (Grandinetti) falls in love with the female matador Lydia (Flores) who gets badly hurt in a bullfight and falls in a coma. In hospital Marco gets to know the male nurse Benigno (Cámara) who dedicates his whole life to the coma patient Alicia (Watling). 'Talk to her!' says Benigno to the crushed and depressed Marco, and means people should communicate with their beloved ones even when it seems they can't understand them. It's the best way of keeping a close nearness to them. The two different men become and still stay friends even when Benigno gets accused one day in having raped the unconscious Alicia...What's happening here is a poetic bizarreness, a journey into the construction of the genders and at the same time of pure cheap sensationalism. When you look close to the pictures, to the story, to the characters you will discover deep humanity, a precise view on the breaking and the constant of the Spanish society. You will also see and understand Almodóvar's art of film making in a matchless connection of serenity and seriousness, of pleasure and mourning, of carnival and tragedy.To re-narrate Almodóvar's film is almost impossible. It's an intense picture of the interiors of its protagonists, full of contrasts and imbued in colors. The master of symbolic imageries traversed Hable con ella with dramaturgic break ins, time jumps and a melodramatic and harshly realistic symbolism. This is not a classic drama with a certain message, but is told like a novel. The director throws in temporal cuts where he thinks they might be efficient.Almodóvar also has an unmistakable nose for actresses and actors with mythic qualities. The famous Spanish singer Rosario Flores, in example, in the role of the female matador has a mysteriously androgenic beauty who suffered bad tragedies in her real life family. Dario Grandetti is Marco, a crying man after all those crying women in Almodóvar's earlier films, whose biography is excellently drawn. Also the cranky Benigno is wonderfully played by Javier Cámara, a tragic figure in the middle of all those tragedies in the hospital.Almodóvar's film is a realistic picture on the crossing of a culture between the old and the new Spanish society: The bullfights, the regime of the mothers, the cult of death on the one side and the desire for life, the self acceptance, the social flip of career and sub culture on the other side. It is also a film about the possibilities of life which you sometimes recognize but often not, about hazards which can effectuate you and your life, about errors which you might discover only after years and years, about your very subjective way of living and how you see others and last but not least about the possibilities of cinema to visualize all this. Hable con ella is neither pessimistic nor optimistic, it seeks for the moments of happy relationships without happy endings, for traces, paths, possibilities, tendencies. No message, no Hollywood, but grand Spanish cinema.</fullReview>

He portrays a Argentinian journalist who is in love with a bull fighter.The other plot in the movie is a relationship between a male nurse and a ballet dancer.Incidentally both the women are in coma and the men speak for them(with them???).Pretty good acting and definitely one of the years best movie..............9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Talk to Her" was painfully slow, which I have no problem with, as longas the filmmaker's wow me at the end. To truly enjoy a film I don'trequire an ending that stuns me, or for that matter, one that bringsclosure to all issues, and certainly not one that's necessarily happy.Just do one of two things; either entertain me while I'm watching or wowme at the end. Unfortunately, this film did neither. The contents mademe wonder why I continued to watch and the ending just left me flat. I saw this film for the first time just recently, and I'm afraid that myexpectations may simply have been too high. I think so much of PedroAlmodóvar, who wrote and directed the piece, that I bought it, (didn'tbother to rent it), without a recommendation from anyone who hadactually seen the film. I'm sure I'll watch it again sometime, this timehopefully with a more grounded point of view that may help me appreciateit more.Based on the fact that the film wasn't in complete chronologicalsequence, it was surprisingly easy to follow, especially considering theforeign language issue. I'm sure this wasn't done on purpose to cater tothe American Public, or anyone else for that matter.I have read a number of reviews here and not one has commented on theone possibility that left me feeling like I hadn't wasted my time. Basedon their behavior toward one another in the final scenes, I feel likeAlmodóvar meant to imply, at least to some degree, that Marco might bethe one who raped Alicia and that Benigno may have been in love withMarco. By that time I was reduced to just hoping for a miracle. Somehuge dramatic twist that would come to light and leave me saying, "Sothat's why I've been sitting here for almost two hours", but it neverdid. Then again, if it happened and I had already anticipated it, thatprobably wouldn't have satisfied me either.If there is one of you out there who has detected something that I mayhave missed or misinterpreted then please let me know. Below are a fewquestions that, if answered, I hope might help me understand andappreciate this film as much as the majority of you who commentedfavorably on it. If you're so inclined, please provide me with answersor at least your opinion for these.Thanks,1.) When talking to Marco from his prison cell, Benigno never deniesraping Alicia. Does this indicate beyond any doubt that he was, in fact,the culprit?2.) Was anyone else expecting Benigno to confess his love for Marco inhis suicide note3.) How does a foreign Language film win an Oscar for Best Writing,Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, get a nomination for BestDirector and not receive a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film?This seems to be very unusual to me, am I right?4.) What was the real significance of Rosario Flores' character, LydiaGonzález? Was she something aside from a tool that allowed these two mento officially meet one another and become friends? If not, why didAlmodóvar waste so much time developing her character in the beginning?After I found out that, prior to the incident that left her comatose,she was about to dump Marco I stopped relating to her all togetheranyway. Come to think of it, I didn't think that her character wasanything special prior to the incident. Am I wrong?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had absolutely no idea what to expect when I watched `Hable Con Ella', except I knew that it would certainly be thought provoking and stylish, having been directed by Pedro Almodovar. It was both of those, as well as extremely compelling and beautiful. `Hable Con Ella' is a tale of obsession, love, friendship and desperation that utilizes metaphors and narration with superior results. There are not a lot of `simple' themes to this film ? Almodovar makes you work through it, and blessedly leaves certain aspects open to interpretation and discussion. He then envelops this story in beautiful scenery, artful cinematography and rapturous music. `Hable Con Ella' is definitely not a Hollywood-type film, and isn't quite an art-house film either, but is certainly original and highly recommended.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think we should have sympathy for Benigno</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite what anyone thinks, I think it is possible to work up some sympathy for Benigno. Sure, it was wrong that he raped Alicia. The reason why I can't hold anything against him is because I believe he didn't know any better. He spent all his life taking care of his mother. Benigno took care of her so much that it looks as if he's never really had any proper exposure to women. I would say that his lack of exposure to women was so bad that he didn't know how to act.I think when he took advantage to Alicia, he probably didn't even know he was doing so. Benigno took care of her for 4 years and spent everyday with her. Maybe spending all that time with Alicia made him fall in love with her... almost to a point where he felt that what he was doing was natural.Benigno was a good man for taking care of her. Remember that even before the rape incident, he was an honorable man. He never gave up hope, never stopped believing in miracles or never stopped treating her like a human being. Remember that Benigno did wash her, massage her, read to her, and talked to her. Now how many people you know would be this dedicated? No, some people would be ready to call a person in a coma a `vegetable' and ready to pull the plug.Benigno's friend Marco was also a great support. Despite what happened, he stuck by his friend. It took strength for Marco not to judge him. I think all Benigno needed was a friend even in this dark moment. Marco used his intelligence and insight to see past Benigno's sin when everyone thought he was a monster. He knew how dedicated Benigno was to Alicia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you leave the theatre, you think that this is a rather average Almodóvar movie. It's not grotesque, it doesn't have that many colours and there is rather little yelling. There is his engagement? But after a while you recognize things. This is about a really strong male passion, although it is spoken, not screamed.The male nurse says that he and his coma girlfriend Alice have a perfect relationship. They never argue. He cares for her body, which he is washing, but he also cares for her soul, watching ballet performances, that she loved, or silent movies and telling her about them. The devotion might seem hopeless, but it is the opposite. His friend the journalist, who also have a girlfriend laying in coma, doesn't speak. He is in despair.This is male love for a woman at its most beautiful level perhaps. There seems to be sacrifice in it, but I'm not sure it is. Well done, really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About the immense love of men towards women...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hable con ella" (Talk to her), the new and brilliant film from Pedro Almodóvar, isn't this time about women (like his also brilliant previous work, "Todo sobre mi madre"), but about how much men love them, about how different men show a different attitude in similar situations and how that huge and sometimes uncontrollable love make men cross a limit that relatively must be no crossed."Hable con ella" tells the story of 2 men who fall in love of different women and find themselves in the same situation. There's Benigno (a wonderful Javier Cámara), in love of Alicia (Leonor Watling), whom he takes care when she ends up in a coma. And there's Marco (Dario Grandinetti) who falls for a bullfighter called Lydia (Rosario Flores), who also ends up in a coma. This extreme situation of the 2 women they love in coma and almost lifeless produces different feelings in these men: while Benigno is happy because he's near of the only woman he has ever love and because he's convinced she shares that love, Marco is depressed and sad because he can't communicate with Lydia and he doesn't know her true feelings.A wonderful movie with many subjects to think about: loneliness, passion, how love can affect us, the idealization we make sometimes of the person we love, etc. The excellent movie inside the movie called "Amante menguante" (Shrinking lover) that Benigno sees summarizes the main theme of the film, which I've written in the subject...Not as powerful and outstanding than "Todo sobre mi madre" and with some flaws (the Marco-Lydia story is less interesting than the other), but excellent anyway, beautifully photographed (by Javier Aguirresarobe), with a terrific score (Alberto Iglesias, without a doubt the best spanish composer working today) and a typical and wonderful Almodóvar cast: Cámara, Grandinetti and Watling shine, Flores is a a good casting choice but you can see that she's not an actress; and in less important roles Chus Lampreave, José Sancho, Elena Anaya, Paz Vega, Fele Martínez (the couple from "Amante menguante"), Loles León, Geraldine Chaplin and even a cameo of Marisa Paredes and Cecilia Roth.Yes, Pedro deserves another Oscar...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like so many of Almodóvar's films, its very creepy and NOT for everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many, many of the films of Pedro Almodóvar are creepy--and it's a rare one (such as "Volver") that isn't. Some are super-creepy but I can get past that because the films are so well written and directed ("The SKin I Live In" is a good example). And, some are just so creepy and downright nasty that I feel like I need to take a bath after seeing them ("What Have I Done to Deserve This?"). Well, "Talk to Her" falls somewhere between these last two categories--perhaps a bit towards category #3! While exceptionally well made, it is just gross and nasty and, perhaps, might be seen as a weird endorsement of deviant behavior.The film revolves around two men who love women who are in comas. One is a reporter who has fallen in love with a female bullfighter who was put into a coma after an unsuccessful bullfight. Another is a creepy guy who works at the long-term care facility. I say creepy because later you learn that his prize patient, who he dotes on lovingly, is a woman he was obsessed with BEFORE her accident that left her in a coma. Being with her and taking care of her is his life. However, it gets MUCH, MUCH worse. Later, this creepy little $&amp;@* rapes the comatose woman. Folks learn about this when she ends up pregnant--pregnant and in a coma! There's more--and, in a way, it ends up looking almost like the film is endorsing the rape. Sort of the 'all's well that ends well' plot twist. As a guy who was a counselor years ago that worked with sex offenders, I found the film pretty sick. Part of this, I am sure, because of the work I did and my experiences (I now feel that therapy with sex offenders is pretty much a waste of time). But part of this is that the film just seems to almost romanticize a guy who is sick and gross and a criminal. See the film for yourself if you'd like. I just think Almodóvar stepped over the line with this one from being entertaining and very well made to being a bit depraved. By the way, although I am NOT a person who in any way endorses PETA and many of the extremist animal rights folks, I did find it disturbing seeing a bull tortured and killed for the film. Yes, I know bullfighting in legal in many places but it just seemed wrong to use the animal this way. Eat 'em, fine. But slowly killing an animal when it wasn't necessary, I am not fine with that.Also, at one point, Lydia says her father was only a banderillo. This is a person who works in the bullring and their job is to torment the bull by sticking metal spikes into its back before the matador enters the ring to eventually kill the animal.Finally, what is with that giant vagina fantasy sequence?! In a surreal or absurdist film it would have been pretty funny but here, once again, it's rather disturbing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like all of the Almodovar films I've seen, this one is overrated in my opinion -- not alone because of the weird premise and the improbable friendship of two men based on nothing more than the fact that they are both emotionally involved with women in a vegetative state. There are many things in this film that don't work for me. But there is one unforgettable element of this picture: a silent film clip(presumably made especially for this movie)which cannot be described without ruining it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie. My guess is that I/you/anyone who sees "Talk to Her" will remember the silent film clip long after they've forgotten everything else about the motion picture in which it is embedded. There's also a lovely party scene (in a bar or restaurant, I think) in which a male singer gives a beautiful rendition of "Cuccurucu (sp.?) Paloma. One of Almodovar's stylistic tricks, allowing scenes to play out at extraordinary length, works very well in this case. Usually, it's an aspect of his style that I find annoying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An evocative, lush masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Internationally acclaimed Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodovar, known for his daring forays into the weird and unexpected, is back with the aptly titled 'Talk To Her,' arguably his most accomplished feature.Most beguiling amalgamation of Almodovar's pet themes, this is about two men, about the loneliness and long convalescence of the wounds provoked by passion. The film carries the offbeat tone of his earlier work, while channelling the richness and textures of modern Spain. Easily categorized as a drama, Almodovar plays with structures with elements of flashbacks and ambiguous story lines about the film's central characters.The film begins with two men, who don't know each other, sitting next to each other, watching a ballet. Both are moved by the story and movement. One of them is Benigno (Javier Camera), a nurse, who is taking care of a beautiful, young ballet dancer, Alicia (Leonor Watling). Alicia has now been in a coma for four years. Benigno is in love with her and talks to her about the ballet, while massaging and washing her body.The other man is an Argentinean travel writer, Marco (Dario Grandinetti), who is currently working on an assignment on a female bullfighter, Lydia (Rosario Flores). Through flashbacks, we learn how Marco became enchanted with Lydia and her vocation as a matador. However, when Lydia is attacked by a bull and falls into coma, Marco blames his blooming relationship with Lydia as the cause of her fatal lack of concentration. And it is at the clinic that Marco discovers Alicia and meets Benigo. Thus, is the beginning of an intense friendship, as linear as a roller coaster. During the time suspended within the walls of the clinic, the life of these four characters flows in all directions, leading all of them to an unexpected destiny?Nominated for 2 Categories, the movie won an Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen - Pedro Almodovar and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film - Spain.In the roles of the two central characters, Javier Camera and Dario Grandinetti are brilliant, straight men at their most vulnerable and torturous. The brilliance of the film is in its script, as Almodovar brings flaws and human enlightenment to the characters. While as a director, knows when to build up moments of suspense, comedy, and melodrama. The art direction by Antxon Gomez is exquisitely ravishing, especially the ballet scenes with lovely set decoration by Federico G. Cambero. Another lovely aspect of the film is the score by Alberto Iglesias, who brings in traditional, Spanish flamenco-style music to the forefront. Along the way, paying tribute to the age of Silent films, 'Talk To Her' is a movie of technical skill and rare depth of intellect and feeling!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Talk to Her" tells of two men who share a common bond - female love interests in comas in the same hospital. One couple offers a baseline of normalcy with the female, a bullfighter, having been gored with important words left unspoken. The other couple is contrastingly aberrant as the one-sided relationship was spawned while the comatose female was in the care of a sexually immature male nurse who falls in love with her. The story which flows from this premise is intriguingly complex and strangely fascinating. Not the usual Hollyweird film fare, "Talk to Her" is austere and understated allowing the masterful crafting of characters and story to fuel viewer interest with realism in lieu of sensationalism. Not for hype junkies, this much lauded flick is well worth a look for those into foreign films, especially Europics, with psychodramatic overtones. (A-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll tell you a secret: I was born in spain. Thus, I grew up with the name of this director ringing in my ears all the time, since he was so "different" and "special". I couldn't watch any of his movies for long, I find them pretentious, boring and terrible.Why, oh, why, did he have to receive an Oscar? Alright, for people who don't care about the mainstream, that means little. However, that only encouraged him more, and the Spanish media was ever so proud of him. More ringing in my ears.Now, we have another piece of rubbish from this individual. One in which 6 bulls are actually tortured and killed FOR REAL. Just for the sake of this **** movie. It seems like the director doesn't believe 35000 bulls tortured and killed every year in spain is enough. He needed more, for the sake of a stupid movie. Or to satisfy his ego, perhaps.I find the fact of taking a creature life for the purpose of shooting a film simply disgusting. I can tell you: most spaniards hate bullfighting. It's movies like this that give a bad name to the country I was born. And I'm not from Catalunya.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler alert! I have to give credit to the director for his artistic skills. However there is a reason why some subjects are difficult.I for one am not interested in seeing a completely non emphatic male nurse raping and innocent and beautiful coma-patient.How honest the emotions portrayed may be. This for me is so sick and so far away from what is perceived to be normal that i found it impossible to relate to the story.I could see his cinematographic skills.But the subject left me feeling i was part of some sort of experiment of the scenario writer and director.I wish i would have never seen the movie. The feelings i got from the movie were mainly that of utter disgust.There is a reason for some subjects being unaccepted within modern society. People that are have strong emotional involvement with stories and characters will have a hard time seeing this movie.There is art that arises nice feelings and there is art looking for provocation or feelings of disgust. This movie is not meant to arise good feelings. I know it is a drama but even drama has its limits!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story that cleverly inspires feelings perhaps contrary to what goes on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pedro Almodovar's 2002 film HABLE CON ELLA is one of the film-maker's most elegant achievements. Benigno (Javier Camera) is a nurse in a Madrid hospital taking care of Alicia (Leonor Watling), a young ballerina who has lived in a coma for the last four years. Marco (Dario Grandinetti) is an Argentinian journalist who watches in horror as his torero girlfriend Lydia (Rosario Flores) falls into a coma after a bullfighting tragedy. The two men form an odd friendship, with Benigno's unwavering love for his ward contrasted with Marco's emotional turmoil. HABLE CON ELLA was the film sensation of the year that I moved to Spain, and I watched it many times then and later. After a recent viewing, I decided that I can fairly declare it to be a masterpiece.HABLE CON ELLA succeeds on several different fronts, from strong acting by this international cast to the bold use of colors and the cinematography. But for me the most memorable are the two psychological tricks Almodovar works in the plot. He inspires such sympathy in the viewer for Benigno, a character who upon rational reflection is arguably monstrous. Then, at the close of the film, he provides what seems like a heartwarming happy ending even when tragedy has unfolded for much of the film. On my recent viewing, I was especially touched by Marco's insightful musings on love in the last flashback scene.Almodovar's movies are often full of odd sexual twists, a fact with which this reviewer is well acquainted and quite used to. For viewers unused to the Spanish auteur, things may initially seem bizarre, but I would call on everyone who likes art cinema to give HABLE CON ELLA a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People talking about Pedro Almodóvars masterpiece and so on... Let's just not exaggerate. Hable con ella is a good movie but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece. The story is easy to follow even if you don't speak the language, and it keeps you interested enough to try to find out what really happened with those comatose girls. I hate matadors so I was actually glad one was in a coma, she could not suffer enough. All the actors played their role brilliantly. Javier Cámara as Benigno Martín gave a good performance playing the weird nurse. I will for sure watch more movies from Almodóvar. He has his own typical style of making movies and it's different then most of the movies I watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk with Her but more suitable as Talk to Her. Pedro Almodóvar, this Spanish director in his 60s, created this somehow deep and profound story. Hable con Ella has two stories converging into one. The first portrays the obsession, I think you can call it that, that Benigno (Javier Cámara), who passed his last years taking care of his mother, and while looking from his window to a class of ballet on the other side of the road where his door leads to, developed around Alicia (Leonor Waitling). Once, he notices that she drops her wallet and runs out to pick it up and give it back and have a talk with her. He finds out several things about her, including where she lived and that her father was a psychiatrist. So a few days later he phoned his father to get an appointment. After which, he gets into her bedroom and even catches Alicia getting out of the shower, freaking her out. Some days after, she has a car accident and gets into a coma. Benigno, immediately applies for a job in the clinic she was being taken care of to get chance of nursing her. In fact he does so and that's where he meets Marco Zuluaga (Darío Grandinetti). Marco meet Lydia (Rosario Flores), a bullfighter, while trying to write a report about her. They get along pretty well until Lydia is hit by a bull in a ceremony, getting into a coma as well. It's quite an interesting movie. It does show great maturity coming from Spanish cinema, not yet very well received, excluding perhaps the American audience. Almodóvar as a lot to do with this, as lately he has been giving Spain several movies, marked as very good from the critics. This particular movie discusses some good points, Cámara has</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pedro Alomodavar's films are always interesting: interesting to look at, and interestingly plotted as well. 'Talk to Her', for example, is about the unlikely friendship that arises between two men caring for their comatose girlfriends, one of whom is possibly guilty of raping "his" girl as she lies unconscious; certainly not a traditional Hollywood plot-line. But I also often feel that Almodovar's plots, for all their points of interest, often don't evolve into a coherent whole; 'Talk to Her' is less flawed than some of his movies in this sense, but I still didn't find I cared very much as the film reached its end. I was also somewhat discomforted by the Amoldovar's own apparent obsession with the female body as object: the camera lingers long and often over the naked bodies of the comatose in a way I found distinctly dehumanising. A scene made in the style of a silent movie from the early 20th century, with a sensibility both romantic and school-boyish (in the worst sense), is the most extreme (but not the only) example of this. You have to give the director credit for his originality; and the film held my interest; but personally, I can't quite accept the claims of Amoldovar's greatness at face value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almodovar's most mature effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone who is looking for the usual comical Pedro Almodóvar might be disappointed at first when watching Talk To Her. It is probably one of his most serious efforts and is apparent right from the beginning. There are moments that are set up where he could have easily taken to his usual dry humor but chooses not to. Not adjusting and accepting Almodóvar's new approach would be unfortunate since it is one of his finer works. The film begins with two men are in a theater watching a blind woman wander around a stage while a man moves chairs and tables out of her way. The story on the stage foreshadows the lives of the two men.Benigno is a nurse who has dedicated his life to one woman for four years, Alicia. She was a dancer who becomes comatose after a car accident. Marco is journalist from Argentina who falls in love with Lydia, a bullfighter. Both of them are on the rebound from relationships that have ended badly. Unfortunately, Lydia is gored and is comatose as well. The two men strike a friendship when Lydia is brought to the same facility where Alicia and Benigno are. Benigno and Marco have two different views of their loved ones conditions. Benigno talks to Alicia, he brings her outside for fresh air, reads to her, and shows her magazines. Marco is very hesitant to the idea and brushes off Benigno's suggestion that he should talk to Lydia. He thinks there is no point if she can't hear him but eventually somewhat relinquishes to Benigno's ideas.What is interesting is that Almodóvar switches the roles of men and women. It is the men who devote their lives to the woman. Sadly, they must live their lives through caring for them and not with them. Benigno doesn't mind working extra hours bathing, cleaning and essentially taking care of her. Marco is frustrated that he can't do any of those things for her. With Marco it is an infatuation while with Beningo it's an obsession. The main theme of Almodóvar's film is caring and hazard of caring too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>almodovar's cinematic inventiveness is refreshing in this 2002 film, a challenging story of lonely men and "desperate" women. yet, i'm left somewhat uneasy about widely accepted interpretations of this film. almodovar presents this film not as a glorification of "love" or emotional connection ? instead, the film asks us to reevaluate the complicated and often dysfunctional ways in which men and women interact. this film challenges us to consider our concepts of rape (even the black and white film/fantasy of benigno's could be considered rape), as well as the concept of the "damsel in distress." in reality, it is the men who are "in distress" throughout this film ? they are alone, have perhaps been abused in the past (as in the invisible plot line of benigno's mother), and display emotional sensitivity which is often considered unacceptable in western culture. yet their reactions to these potential "problems" become increasingly disturbing throughout the film.i see inherent selfishness of these two men and their compulsion to "talk to her," but not to listen. benigno clearly does have a problem with obsession (contrary to some romanticized interpretations of the film), and marco is continually placing himself in the knight-in-shining-armor role. the story of marco and lydia right before she lapses into coma is indicative of this ? her last words to him are evidence of how much his story has been told, and how little hers has. even lydia's fascinating story as a female bullfighter is muted in the face of his epic narrative: he sees her "in distress" on television, and saves her ? from a snake, from the cruel press, from her former lover, etc. the pattern is amplified by the story of his previous love, whom he tried to save from drugs. when there is no more lydia to save, he does his best to save benigno. when there is no more benigno to save, there's alicia. we never see him interacting with his partners, as it were, except under these circumstances.to be honest, and to use a bit of informal language, benigno just plain freaked me out. i saw a lot less wounded puppy in him and a lot more norman bates. almodovar draws this out in the jail scenes ? if the man were thoroughly harmless, he could never even threaten to "go psychopath" because of his supposedly poor treatment. i think the story properly rewards his totally antisocial behavior ? he is denied the opportunity to "unite" with his love because the drugs he takes kill him, instead of merely leaving him in a coma. almodovar's gentle treatment of this character is an interesting mask that makes us work to understand the true insidiousness of his nature.i do appreciate the cinematographic beauty of this film, and its celebration of the female form (even if it is always skinny and painted). and i don't think that almodovar is a misogynist, although less critical audiences may reflect misogyny in their interpretations of the film. an artist like this director would expect as much critical thought on the part of the audience as he put into creating the work. that extra leap tells a very different story than the veneered surface would suggest. the only real criticism i would have is that almodovar backs down at the end, leaving the audience with the simplistic and, really, meaningless argument that relationships are "complicated." i want to root for the ending romance ? it's what we're conditioned to do ? but really, all i see in the future for marco and alicia is another dysfunctional world characterized by paternalism and helplessness. here's hoping she speaks up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a touching drama about men loving women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almadovar's Talk to Her follows two men who are in love with women who are both in commas.In some ways Almadovar is like Tarkovsky but a Latin soap opera version of him. The beginning scene is very expressionistic, throwing the viewer into some trance, where we watch an older, beat down looking woman going through some sort of dilapidating dance or breakdown and some 8 meters behind her is a younger woman who is doing the same dance but is just about 6 seconds behind. And the two men of the story are in, what we later discover to be a theatre, one so effected that he is crying, the other effected by how affected the guy next to him is. I'll also add how this is a very interesting start to showing characters, how they are watching what we were watching, and suddenly its like some philosophical reversal where really we are all watching some show happening before us.Later we get into the thick of the film: two women in a comma, two men, each loving one of the women. And then the one guy (I should consider taking notes and writing the characters and actors name down - next time) who is also the care-taking of the ballet dancer in a comma is accused of raping her.The film uses many flashbacks, giving us back stories of the relationships these men had with these women, and ultimately moving the story forward with us more clear about the emotional investment, or maybe obsession, that existed. Then the film deals with how the men each very differently deal with their emotions, and it almost feels Shakespearean at times, tragic and unfortunate but moving and sweet.In all a beautiful story. Maybe too beautiful for me because I was very conscious of the drama, the heavy handed straight forward dialog, between the characters. And yet I can put this aside just a little because after having watched this movie it seemed the most important thing I was left with was a feeling of awe and calm. another 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almodóvar's previous movies usually ended up in one direction, be it sentimental, nostalgic, over-the-top or over-structured. But here he balances all and it makes his best movie to date. It is well-structured and written with the weaving of the narrative in time, the silent(!) film as a movie-in-the-movie and the mystery surrounding the character of Alice. It is highly imaginative storytelling, feeling sometimes improvised, but always striking the right tone. And it has the right flow even when unusual cinematic moves are used like ballet to tell part of the story (another filmmaker using musical performances is Lynch, and I cannot believe the garden fence from Blue Velvet is shown here as a coincidence).Obsessions form the center: obsession for one's profession, obsession for women. Compared with Breaking the Waves for example, where the naive wife has to become a prostitute and makes the ultimate sacrifice to rescue her husband, here we have it almost reversed: a rape on a comatose by an obsessed naive male leads to her rescue but his demise. Or did the rape never take place and was it a miracle? The ambiguities in the movie make it all the more interesting.Almodóvar's portrayal of women is often one-sided (neurotic, dominating) or caricatural. Not so here: all female characters are well-developed. It takes Hable con ella to another level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Variations on the Overcomatose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Giorgio Agamben's HOMO SACER describes the overcomatose patient as an individual whose coma is one "in which the total abolition of relational life functions corresponds to an equally total abolition of vegetative life function" (Mollaret and Goulon in HOMO SACER.)..."a stage of life beyond the cessation of all vital functions" (HOMO SACER). In his ANGELAKI article on Agamben, Benjamin Noys says that this "produces a problem with the definition of the time of death, because it renders obsolete the ancient criteria of death: the stopping of the heartbeat and the cessation of breathing. By these criteria the overcomatose patient is alive, but yet they seem to waver between life and death as an uncanny figure of our potential fate as modern subjects."The comas in HABLA CON ELLA seem a lot more old-fashioned in that you don't see a lot of apparatus around, only a beautiful young comatose girl who is carefully tended by an abnormally brought-up male nurse and then "cultivated" in a most unique way; and a bullfighter feminist whose lover, though virile, is unable to help with any of the nursing (however, she hadn't been able to tell him he'd been dropped before the accident and coma, so he hung around until the old lover, Nino, informed him.) With Pina Bausch Dance Company on hand at the beginning to see if we have updated, that is to say, lowered our dance standards and expectations well enough, we can almost say that when the comatose Alicia is impregnated and brought back to a full consciousness despite the loss of the child and what may or may not be a lifetime dependency on a crutch, physical therapy notwithstanding--why,we can almost say that it is almost as if we see Martha Graham being interviewed and talking about "my garden in New York," in which some green shoots seemed to be able to grow their gnarled way through some wire fencing, thus proving once again the "power of the life force!" (Of course, it was only the power of Graham doing the talking about this that made it striking: There isn't a thing uncommon about seeing how the spring makes its way through the ironclad machine of New York--every year. We have once again the banal made magical; almost anyone with a fame mystique can do it. Although, there is one bit of uniqueness here, in that the phrase "my garden in New York" is fairly rare; most people find it difficult to situate their talk of gardening in the middle of large cities, even if they have one there as well as in the country; this is the result of the fear they harbour that people might not have known that they definitely owned a country house and garden as well as a city one...)As if that ghost were not pungent enough, Geraldine Chaplin in a superlative performance as Alicia's ballet mistress eerily resembles Graham in her 90's, precisely when she would have spoken of this "New York Garden" and, as well, of "the body as a garment..." To her credit, Chaplin also resembles Margot Fonteyn in her 60's. She is elegant and puts one in mind of Suzanne Farrell in ELUSIVE MUSE directing her class in which she instructs the students at the barre: "Do NOT look at the floor. YES, we are servants of the DANCE... but we are MAJESTIC servants...we are NOT washing the floor." Ms. Farrell, a deeply religious ballerina, would have been the first to admit that, despite her near saintliness, she was NOT going to subsist on the diet that would have been a prerequisite for working for Mother Teresa (soup and tea) rather than George Balanchine ("Mr. B taught me to roast veal with the fat side up--and he was right." Of course, this is the banal made magical again by fame; all roasts, even if not veal, are made with the fat side up...)These variations on "bare life" bring into close communication people who would not have chosen each other as friends for any other reason except common distress and proximities to each other's involvements in these distresses.It is quite unfathomable that Marco would actually become so close to the nurse Benigno for purely "like-interest" reasons. This is a tale within the whole film that shows a magnificent arc of almost unbelievable humanism. It seemed believable enough that Marco would leave the beach in Jordan and make the long journey back to Segovia in order to do what he could for Benigno, but things like that seem less and less believable, it seems like fewer and fewer people are doing them. People can be troubled by other people only in the most minor, easily solved problems; they are willing to throw friendships out on a moment's notice if anything becomes the least bit pressing. It is also moving how deeply Chaplin's ballet-mistress cherishes her former student while she seems to be doomed forever to her coma.New connections are made between the "bare life" figures and the sentient ones. The two comatose girls are said by Benigno to be talking to each other (possibly). Marco is less interested in this sort of sentiment. Benigno idealizes "bare life" and tries for it for himself as a means of communication with someone else in a variety of bare life. Is there an equation in the fact that he cannot achieve it because a well-spring of life where he least expected it has occurred without his knowing (and surely without his truly wanting, because the dependency on him would be totally unimaginable by then; already he's been separated from the reality of it)--so that he, rather unexpectedly arrives for himself at something that is, by still-current definitions, nay, even very modern ones, well-beyond even the over-comatose?And it is in that state that Marco can talk to him, and it is hard to say whether that is moving or not. With the new forms of "bare life" showing their new species every minute, is it not possible that any number of phenomena heretofore defined as "inanimate" or "buried, so that must mean dead" will be called into question? Even a slab and headstone may eventually present no obstacles to the new sociopaths. Already I know many people who have "online communities" who do not know that that is "bare life" if anything is.The prisoners at Marco's Segovia jail are not "inmates," but are rather "interns."Perhaps they could be said to be "loose-structure-challenged."All these wonderful new ways we have to communicate with each other through adversity!We can now go and befriend all of the people we have no natural attraction to whatever!What's more, we must even be forced to if we won't move toward that goal of equality-brutality on our own.For example, a demonstration of how a shrinking cinematic man can remain with his lover whose body does not follow suit: So that she does not roll over onto him on the bed while asleep, he takes off his clothes (which have deliciously shrunk with each stage of his own shrinking--an exorbitantly expensive wardrobe his mother had had to keep him in) and climbs into the garden of earthly delights that is her vagina...and is said to have stayed there...whether there was enough oxygen for his miniscule lungs is a matter which may or may not have to do with yet another variety of "bare life..."In any case, the matter of the fact of inequality was glossed over by the production of a pleasured, new womb-apartment.On a less exotic level, many of us can even learn how to keep from blowing up Kinko's when we have to get something copied there and are told on purpose by repressed-bad-attitude clerks that it will be ready earlier than it ever is...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fates Run Together...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In other films I have reviewed, I have stated that I am a fan of international cinema. This is the first film I have seen by Pedro Almodovar all the way through (I happened upon "All About My Mother on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation station that is seen on my basic cable system). I think he is a very talented director and he really has a way of telling stores that involve fates intertwining. This is a very good film.Here are my reasons (spoilers): (1) The opening sequence of the film is an exemplary metaphor. The ballet scene sets the tone and pacing of the film and it foreshadows how the film will play out. (2) At the beginning, we see two men sitting next to each other at the ballet. These two men are brought together through very odd but plausible circumstances. The actors who played both Benigno and Marco anchored this film with their excellent portrayals of men drawn together by extraordinary happenings. They reminded me of people I might actually meet on the street. (3) For the performances to work, they need plausible circumstances and the audience needs to see how they came together. There respective stories are told through flashbacks and forwards and those flashes don't offset the pacing at all. The editing is well-done and I didn't feel that I missed anything that may have been important. (4 and 5) These reasons run together. Pedro Almodovar is a master of his craft. It seems his MO (at least in recent films) is telling stories of intertwining fate and he succeeds immensely. He is a master hand at directing and writing films. The Oscar he received for writing and his nomination for direction were both deserved. (6) My favorite aspect of the film was Marco and Lydia's relationship. This aspect of the movie seemed to be the most realistic. They are drawn together because they suffered traumatic heartbreak. The scenes they shared on screen didn't seem forced or at all implausible. This was a screen couple that truly loved one another. The scene after the wedding supports this logic. (7) As the film the came to a close, I was surprised at a couple of interesting twists that happened. By the final ballet scene, I was thinking that this was the best to end the film. It was a bittersweet yet hopeful note. (8) I love fate-driven movies. It seems that most of the films that I have seen from Europe are of the fate-driven variety and they are all good. Eight reasons give a score of eight.The major downfall of this movie is (1) the action of Benigno with Alicia. Those moves he made repulsed me to almost no end. It is hard not to feel sympathy for his character but that still doesn't excuse what he did. Despite that, those actions were needed to push the story to the seemingly correct resolution. I guess some sort of damage has to be instilled in at least one character to tell a great story. A smaller downfall comes in (2) the silent movie sequence. I really like symbolism but that scene was just out there and almost sadistic. I am not a fan of seeing women being messed with while they sleep. I believe the same logic applies as above as to why this sequence was needed.Overall, I really liked this movie despite the rather sick content that ran through the last half of the film. I guess Almodovar likes to push boundaries like any real maverick filmmaker. I have seen almost two films by him ("All About My Mother" turned me off after I found out who the boy's father was) and for the better parts, they were awesome. Even with the questionable content, they are still much better than some of the prime-time TV I catch occasionally. Pedro Almodovar is one of the best filmmakers from Europe in the industry right now and he can make a very good fate-driven film with ease. Here ends my rant!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've taken a break from writing reviews, out of laziness mainly. I've endured life without writing about "The Pianist", brilliant movie by the way, and without writing about my personal, let's call it "wish-movie", "Dreamcatcher, which was quite a waste unfortunately, but now...I simply can't take it any more. It did take me two viewings though to actually decide to review it, but it was so good that it blew me away right from the start. The movie, yes, you guessed(as in you're on the movie's page), "Hable con Ella", aka "Talk to Her". It took the Oscar and as I was watching the Awards and I saw Almadovar, I knew I had to see this movie. Of course, he lacked the superficiality of many American stars, stars who are pretty unconcerned about being in the spotlight, but he also had this look in his eyes...and his words were words for peace, but unlike Mr. Moore, he didn't force the note. A smart man and now I can say, a great director.SPOILERSIt all starts with a theatre piece. The start isn't that original, but the piece itself is somewhat strange. No need describing it. We see the main characters: Benigno and Marco. Marco is one of my favorite names, by the way. Two persons who have little in common, at least at this first glance. The script goes in such a way, that they will become great friends. The end is somewhat tragic, but it is also optimistic. If we think a little bit about it, it is as good as it could have gotten. Benigno is a very naive fellow, someone who lives in his own world, but he is also a very friendly person. We get the usual opinion about him from the people with who he works, but that doesn't matter. In his naive thinking he falls in love, as we all do from time to time, but unfortunately his love is in a coma. This should be metaphorical. Alicia is her name. Benigno stands for one thing in my opinion: love is only for the mad people. Though he is not mad...not completely at least. He is strange and in his strangeness he does thinks which we might consider mad, but for him it's...well, love. Of course, I won't argue that he is healthy, mentally speaking, but he's got all his circumstances, which are the excuse, or better to say the explanation for his situation. As I said, love is for the mad ones. This sentence does however have a limited validity. Then there's the whole hope thing. You need to hope in such cases...and all you can wait for is a miracle. One time Benigno tells Marco that he did not think their relationship was going too well, I'm referring to the relationship between Marco and his, also in a coma "partner", the toreador Lydia. It is a funny thing to say and it sounds even funnier as Benigno says it, but i want to show something here: Marco does not talk to her. Nino, the other "lover" of the toreador, does. Benigno talks to her, as in Alicia. Marco talks with Alicia. Get the point? All the things in this movie come together harmonically, and this fact makes it easy for the viewer to assume what might happen next. It's all a matter of being attentive.I want to say I was worried, once, really worried during the movie. It was all going so smoothly, and then I saw Benigno so tense around Alicia. I though "Please, no...don't ruin the movie...please don't". In a way he didn't listen to me. But, brilliant move here by Almadovar, or whoever takes the credit for it: the movie isn't ruined. The whole situation is portrayed in a perfect way and it's all totally acceptable. It's even the thing the movie needed. The tragic end is again, as expected. Still, I liked the metaphor "to escape", or how it was. Not escape from the prison, but escape from the world without Alicia, the true prison for Benigno, a poor fool in love. Should his act be judged, I would consider him not guilty. Such a man shouldn't be sent to jail, but I wouldn't want him walking around my daughter(if I were old enough to have one) in his mental state. Only after a pretty long period of psychiatric help. All I said until here seems to have Benigno in the center...and it is so. But he is never alone in most of this. I couldn't imagine the movie without Marco. Marco, the voice of reason, Marco, the powerful and imposing man, who cries at the most touching songs or scenes, Marco, the true friend. Marco is the character most are probable to like more than Benigno, as he is normal, but romantic as well. The fact that his relationship with Lydia won't work, or at least isn't supposed to work, can be noticed by his behavior. A man who suffers 10 years because he gets separated from his loved one and then someone who doesn't..."talk to her"? I don't think so. The fact that Marco and Benigno are pretty much the same, not at the first look of course, might be noticed when the first one goes to visit Benigno. The image...the reflection of one's face of the other's. Match. Now that I said part of what there was to say, I wish to end this with an invitation, for all the people who have not yet seen this movie: I invite you to make yourselves a favor, and check this out. I warn you though, that if you are the kind of person who doesn't truly believe in friendship and love you might not catch the true taste of this movie.If anyone wonders what mark I've considered for this movie, I'll whisper it to you: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mixed reactions about confusing drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HABLE CON ELLA might be very pleasant to watch. Indeed, it is. But that is also why it leaves me quite uncertain as to what Almodovar actually wants to say with his film. On the surface, the film builds up a somewhat polished and low-key atmosphere. The soundtrack provides soothing, warm music. All in all, the formate corresponds largely to what is expected of 'artistic European film of today'. I find, however, the aesthetic impression more confusing than attracting. Why? Because there is a great discrepancy between the plot of the film and the atmosphere it creates. Two men become friends after it becomes clear that both of them have a comatosed object of romantic feelings. The viewer gets to see how they develop quite different attitude towards the comatosed 'lover'. One of them, Benigno, dedicates himself fully to the comatosed woman, who he doesn't actually know. (And it is difficult to see what he feels for her at all) Without revealing too much about the story, it is clear that the focusing on the two men is highly problematic. The two women, both in coma, remain mere objects; the two men admires them only as objects of phantasy. Naturally, it would be grotesque to call this admiration (or whatever) love. Here Almodovar clearly falls prey to romanticizing a conventional picture of Woman as Object for Love.Perhaps the viewer is not encouraged to condone to the horrible deeds performed by one of the men. In fact, the viewer is not encouraged to take a stand at all. One gets easily sucked in by the fine pictures and the charming music, perhaps reacting with both slight sympathy (well, isn't it great what kind of feelings Man is capable of??) and a vague sense of uneasiness with the turn the plot finally takes. My objection: the film leaves room for too great a variation of reactions - it is vague. Why is that so bad? Well, because the deeds that are performed, and the attitude shown by the men towards the two women, are such that vagueness can't be anything but a misplaced, corrupt perspective. The viewer is tempted to sympathize with things that one can sympathize with only if one doesn't see their real meaning, their seriousness.In sum, instead of making a serious film, Almodovar seems to aim at creating two pleasant hours for his audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am struggling to think of something to like about this movie. I had read the great reviews and sat down to watch it with very positive expectations, but I'm mystified as to what is good about it. I actually considered turning it off part way through.Okay, it's not shallow, and the acting is good. But that's really the only positive comment I can make.The plot is just a pitiful, depressing story centering around Benigno, a sick criminal. I didn't like him much when he seemed like just silly wimp, so you can bet that no sympathy for the character developed when he turned out to be a much more despicable character.Marco is fascinating at the beginning of the film, mostly because of his brooding virility. But this impression is completely dashed by the end of the story, to the extent that I wondered why I ever admired him in the first place.And then there's the bullfighting. A lovely sport, eh? How much more repulsive and cruel can you get? I'm supposed to ADMIRE the female matador, Lydia? The last thing the world needs is women following in the testosterone-poisoned steps of men in an endeavor like bullfighting. She seemed as pitiful as the other characters to me.The scenes with fleetingly-shown character Alicia were probably the only really uplifting ones in the film, as she had an ethereal beauty which was captivating. But this is only a small bone thrown to the viewer amidst the general significance-starvation of the movie as a whole.My overall impression of the film is one of disgust! Yuck. I feel like I not only wasted $5 and 2 hours, but need a shower.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rich And Fulfilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a writer, Pedro Almodovar has evolved from an off the wall scenarist with serious themes to a serious scenarist with off the wall themes and both styles have managed to complement him as a filmmaker. The screenplay for `Talk To Her', with its effortless transition from entertaining character study in its first half to moving treatment of love in the second, is furthered by Almodovar's exquisite, sensitive use of camera placement and lighting, allowing for a richness of emotion that sneaks up on you in a dazzling, heartfelt finale. The unusual (to say the least) plot is about two men who form a relationship while the women they love are both in comas; but Almodovar refuses to play it for laughs, instead using it to inquire about the male approach to both sexes, suggesting, in a myriad of ways both literary and cinematically, that there is very little to differentiate between them. Almodovar has always been an actor's director and this is no exception, but the sublime performance by Javier Camara as the film's central character, a male nurse who has taken the job just to be near the comatose dancer he loves, is especially inventive; long-faced, with a continual hangdog expression, Camara's gentle appeal subtly grows on you as the film progresses so that when he commits an act you know is virtually unthinkable, he--and the director--are forgiven when they use it as a catalyst for the blossoming life affirmation at the end. While it's hampered (only slightly) by some slow sections midway that threaten to lull the film to a halt, there's a rhythm that the director establishes that makes the story flow seamlessly. `Talk To Her' certainly cements Almodovar's reputation as a world-class filmmaker who seems nowhere near his peak. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>delicate harmonies of the desperation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pedro Almodóvar in Talk to her returns from old subjects of his notorious filmography,I have four examples 1- `the bullfighting'taken from his film MATADOR(1986) ;2- in LIVE FLESH (1997) the subject was `couple dependency,obsession and the tragic of an accident that one of the protagonist has to face';3 - lovers that can't find each other as in THE FLOWER OF MY SECRET(1995).If ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER shows feminine solidarity in HABLE CON ELLA is all about male friendship.Two men ,Marco and Benigno ,two great performances by Dario and Javier!I thought it was very well directed and acted.I liked what Almodóvar did with his characters he inverted the roles:men with female characteristics and woman with male characteristics.A man who cries and a female bull fighter;a `nurse man'(very feminine profession)who takes care of someone(his mother then his patience).ALSO the filme has great small details about the lack of communication: ;an off cell phone ;the interrupted phone call in the prision;when Marco can't hear the woman who works in the prision(the bull fighter woman also couldn't talk with Marco in the car because he can't stop talking!) and the most noticeable:Alicia ,the dancer ,loved `silent films'.(Geraldine Chaplin,the daughter of one of the greatest in `silent cinema(Charles Chaplin) also appeared in Talk to her!).In Almodóvar filmography we witness `solitude' in small dosis:a woman taking care of her plants or pets;a TV always on;in HABLE CON ELLA,there is always a'book'on the bedside table,remember `the advice' to OPHELIA(in Hamlet) - - read a book to conceal the loneliness'-. Without judging his characters,the vision of Almodóvar is particular and honest(`let the hypocrites to judge who or what is right or wrong')The ending, when the dancers appeared on the left side of the screen IT'S SO beautiful!. I also loved when the great brazilian musician Caetano Veloso appears singing that beautiful song!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, Absorbing and Poignant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers)Almodovar may seem to be getting a little more mainstream here, but his plot is as kinky as ever, and the same can be said for his characters. Benigno the male nurse is overtly so and Marco the journalist is pretty screwed up too, but this takes a while to emerge. Both have the disadvantage that the object of their affections is lying in a coma, but in Benigno's case this is probably the only way he could have a relationship with the beautiful Alicia; for her he would be undoubtedly a frog rather than a prince. Marco, on the other hand had a bilateral relationship with Lydia the bullfighter but it was not going well before her accident, and Marco's emotional insensitivity (`we did talk ? ? `no, you did') means that the relationship was doomed anyway. I like the straightforward way Almodovar deals with his oddball characters and the effortless way he engenders sympathy for them. He has an eye both for detail and for landscape and the result is easy to watch. The black and white `silent movie' sequence is daring and inventive though I'm still not sure if its purpose was to put Benigno in the frame for Alicia's pregnancy; it has to be said he is a pretty likely suspect. The bullfighting sequences are interesting because it is the bullfight seen through Spanish eyes, not through Hollywood's distorting lens. The relationship between ballet, bullfighting and theatre is carefully delineated. Is it all a bit difficult to understand? As Katerina (Geraldine Chaplin) remarks at the end; `Believe me, I'm a ballet mistress. Nothing is simple.' A beautiful, absorbing and poignant film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating film, with an incredible performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hable con ella (2002) is a fascinating movie, and well worth seeing. The writer/director, Pedro Almodóvar, can be misogynistic at times, but I didn't sense this tendency in Hable con ella.The film is a friendship tale between two men, an Argentinian journalist, and a Spanish nurse. The journalist, although sensitive to beauty in dance and music, is by far the tougher and more realistic of the two. The nurse is gentle, caring, and unworldly.This friendship is outwardly unlikely, but makes good sense as the plot unfolds. The friendship is at the heart of the story and of the movie.Although the acting is generally competent, in my opinion the acting honors must go to Rosario Flores, who portrays Lydia, a bullfighter.Flores doesn't have the made-for-cinema beauty of someone like Penelope Cruz. She has a long face, a prominent nose, and dark, tangled hair. Flores gives a bravura performance as a woman who earns her living killing bulls. Cruz could never make me believe that she was a matador--Flores had me totally convinced. The movie is worth seeing just to watch Flores demonstrate her total mastery of the role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Love Story for Vegetarians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Benigno loves Alicia. Marco loves Lydia. The only problem is that Alicia and Lydia are both comatose. The relationship between the two gentlemen and their respective lady-friends is, as the English would undoubtedly put it, awkward. The two men meet in the hospital and become friends. One might suppose this is a somewhat creepy basis around which to build a romantic movie. Certainly Hollywood wouldn't have touched it. Under the guiding hand or Pedro Almodovar, however, this otherwise dreary premis works wonderfully well. Needless to say, the story plays out mainly through the relationship between the two men. Under the curcumstances, the women don't have a whole lot to say for themselves. Alicia, the ballerina, is already in a coma when the film begins. As for Lydia, the female bull-fighter, even in the scenes when she is conscious she complains to Marco on several occasions that she can barely get a word in edgewise.Benigno, who works as a male nurse taking care of Alicia, gives Marco helpful advice about how to handle his relationship with Lydia. It is advice that the grief-stricken Marco is, at first, reluctant to accept. `What do you know about women', the worldly Marco replies, `the only ones you've ever known were vegetables!' It turns out that Benigno knows a lot about caring of his comatose charge. He massages her muscles to prevent atrophy and he tells her everything that is going on in his life. He does more, too; possibly too much. Does Benigno go too far? Almodovar leaves that to the audience. There are no cut and dried answers in `Talk to Her', just as there are no cut and dried answers in life.</fullReview>

I mean, it had its moments. But, I did not feel the emotion that the filmmaker was trying to convey.

		<fullReview>Male carer Benigno looks after Alicia day and night as she is in a coma. He talks to her constantly and feels like this relationship is one of the best times of his life. Into this situation comes Marco, who's bullfighter girlfriend has been put into a coma. Marco doesn't want to talk to his girlfriend in this state and is also haunted by something she needed to say to him that she can now not say. He gets to know Benigno as he helps him to learn to talk to the girls, however can an one sided relationship really be love?I didn't know what this was about when I went to see it and coming out, to be honest, I'm still unsure. The film looks at love and loneliness in the lives of two men, both in different states at different times. It sounds simple but it's hard to grasp ? I'm still not sure what it was getting at. Benigno appears to be the likeable one in his relationship with Alicia (despite being a little weird), while Marco appears a little weird and distant when Lydia goes into a coma. However this is switched when it is suggested that Benigno's relationship is not as harmless as it is suggested ? then he becomes the weird one and Marco appears to be the one holding it all together.It's all a bit sad and challenging but is it really all it seems. I too suspect that Marco was prehaps the weird one while Benigno's idea of love really was one of innocence and talking. It is suggested that Marco is a talker and his relationship with Lydia seems to be all him talking and her repressing, also he admires Alicia and admits to looking at her breasts. The final twist in the film where Marco begins to repeat the way in which Benigno falls for Alicia (with more success) also hints that he has had a desire for her and envies Benigno's relationship for her and, now that she out of her coma, wants to have that same relationship by going the same route. This changes the whole tone of the film for me and makes it much more deep.On the surface the film appears disturbing, eerie and challenging. It certainly doesn't seem very cheerful and is very sad ? all the more so by the haunting score. However the strength of it is that it makes you think and it'll create plenty of thought long after it has finished. It is slightly funny but to be honest it isn't really the focus and I found it to be darkly amusing rather than funny.Cámara is very good indeed as Banigno ? he doesn't let him become retarded but he does bring out innocence and naivety. However he also manages to keep him likeable throughout. Grandinetti is intense but it doesn't always come off. He does a good job with a difficult role but he occasionally does that art-house thing of staring into the distance while smoking a cigarrette. The female roles, usually the main roles of Almodóvar, are literally silenced and the film is carried by the two male roles. Almodóvar's direction is excellent ? great shots but also very clever shots that will only serve to add to your debate after the film has ended.Overall this is not an easy film to watch but is worth putting the effort in for the reward of using your brain. On it's surface it seems like the last thing on earth you'd want to see but, if you're willing to think then you'll find this rewarding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply unsympathetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I nearly turned off the DVD, and I should have. Initially, I was put off by the bullfighting scenes. This production used real footage. Bullfighting is legal in Spain, and in Madrid it is excluded from a law protecting animals used in film or television. The swords, blood, and distress of the animals are real. A lot of people found this film to be poetic, lyrical and deeply layered, the kind of film you see once in a lifetime. Frankly, I simply could not connect with it.*SPOILERS BELOW*Is having sex with a comatose woman rape? My question is: why is it of cinematic interest?Benigno, a nurse and voyeur, at first stalks Alicia. In his obsession he visits her Psychiatrist father in a ruse to get into their apartment, steals a personal item from her bedroom, and startles her as she comes out of the shower. Later, an unfortunate accident puts her into a coma. Her father wants the best nurse for her personal care and Benigno is assigned to duty. Though she clearly had no interest in him while healthy and in fact seemed repulsed, he nurses her with tenderness and romantic love. He is more content in his life taking care of her inert body than any other time. If that isn't inane and creepy enough, he consummates his love. At this point, I got up to check the reviews of this film, hoping for clues that Benigno had some type of honor and was wrongfully accused. The glowing reviews refused to spoil, so I labored on but was disappointed. Nothing about violating a defenseless woman is "beautiful", "haunting", "unmissable, or "illuminating", no matter how loving the intention. I'm sure the families of such victims, some who end up raising the consequence, would agree with me.The film does explore the emotional lives of men in a way that American films rarely do and surely has many other good qualities, but, after chaffing my sensibilities with such an atrocious ploy as to try to make love out of rape, I really wished I had just turned it off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing how so many critics have raved about this film, and how several put it at the top of their "Best of 2002" lists, I was looking forward to it. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. The story poses an interesting concept. I won't spoil it, but basically, two men are in love with two women who are in comas. One man is obsessive, the other is "the other man," but does not know this until after she is out cold. They develop a sort of friendship, which is complicated when one of them acts inaproppriately out of his obsession.There are also some creative "surrealist" moments in the film (particularly during the shrinking lover b/w portions), but I found them to be more flashy and "oohh look he's being different" than intelligent and thought provoking. The film also contains an abundant amount of female nudity, which after a while became gratuitous. It's greatest weakness however is a slow plot. It takes nearly half the movie until an interesting plot point hits-- not to mention that the cuts are far too slow. The images might be pretty, but that doesn't make them entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drama According To Pedro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One must credit Pedro Almodóvar for trying to expand the limits of drama to the point of disbelief. Each genre has its own boundaries: the limits of what ET can do in science fiction are wider than James Bond's in spy films, Bond's are wider than Blanche Dubois' in drama, and so on. Sometimes breaking those molds works, as in Woody Allen's "Crimes and Misdemeanors"; sometimes it doesn't turn out that good. Almodóvar forces credibility to the extreme in his script for "Hable con ella" (as in the terrible "Lucía y el sexo"), a film that seems to aspire to the level of "serious drama". This is not the first time Almodóvar tries to do so: he also did in "Todo sobre mi madre". This time he was luckier, but -truth be told- in its core, beyond the film-within-film techniques or the crossing of present, flashforwards and flashbacks (which have been done before and better, remember "Two for the Road" in 1967?), this type of story is plain, old-fashioned and pedestrian psychological melodrama. Pedro must be laughing at those who have given this film the votes a "one of the top 250!, "best foreign film" or "best script." If you ask me, I consider some of his rather raw scripts (as "What Have I Done To Deserve This?" and "Matador") more groundbreaking and intelligent than this. But then, why should we spoil Almodóvar's party to excellent music (which took the movie's only Goya award, the top Spanish prizes, all won understandably by Fernando León de Aranoa's excellent "Los lunes al sol".)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does this represent Spanish men's unconscious about women? Scary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I just about managed to see it to the end but it is a very confusing movie and I cannot see the beauty in it. All I can take from this movie is a subconscious drama unfolding about a Spanish male problem about women and their relationship to them and sex. It is a Freudian dream of a film and starting at the beginning with an actress who looks like a man and who is a bullfighter (not very common in male dominated profession) who has a problem with snakes (phallic?). Not only does she have a problem with snakes but she has problems with her father and her lovers (surprise surprise) and of course she ends up gored by a bull, in a coma and finally dead so the male population of Spain does not have to deal with her. Meanwhile, another drama unfolds in the film with a strange little man who has been devoted to his mother all his life and is a virgin. He becomes obsessed with a gorgeous young girl and even follows her into her home and freaks her out. Surprise Surprise. Before we can really understand what is motivating this strange little man, the gorgeous girl is hit by a car and put into a coma. Strange little man can now become her nurse and wash her, rub her and finally rape her. What does this all symbolise? Men feeling empowered by having absolute control over a woman? We also get various views of this lovely girl's body turning on various men in the hospital = that is voyeurism and another male fantasy. The journalist who runs between the two parallel stories is another weirdo. He can't commit to anyone (another male problem?) except in the end to the strange little man who has been put in prison for rape. The journalist seems to suspend all judgement on what this man has done to this poor girl and the emphasis is then on their friendship (male bonding about the problems of sex and even latent tones of homosexuality with men who are basically incapable of having normal relationships with women). The film is getting seriously weirder and very boring by now. The gorgeous girl awakes, the strange little man kills himself and we are back in a theatre watching funny dances about the meaning of love and men and women. The journalist is crying and the gorgeous girl looks like she may fancy him. By this time I was crying myself, mostly tears of ridicule, some of relief that it was over and finally because I am wondering if I really should go to Spain on holiday ever again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[Spoilers] I must confess that I did not find this as enjoyable as the other people here. Reviews here locally weren't good but as I normally enjoy european films I thought I'd have a watch. A typical continental European film which focuses on intrinsicate scenes, pointless attention to detail and character development at a snail pace. One of the faults of these type of films is how attention to detail in everything allows the focus of the story to be lost. Plot lines are started, people introduced and then nothing. I wasn't kept transfixed on the film mainly due to its slow pace, and was continually aware that I was watching a film in a cinema - something a good film does not do. At the end you wonder what was the point of the film... The two lead male characters were not likeable in any way so you lose any emotional ties with them.Strange ending. One of those films you love or hate. Doesn't fit into any type of film category. Have to see it yourself. Moments of humour, but the silent movie moment with the shrinking man was totally absurd. A few people left during the film but I stuck with it. 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bulls are really abused and killed in this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie 7 until I discovered on the discussion board and PETA's website (peta.org/feat/bullmovie/) that bulls were actually abused, tortured and killed for this movie. In protest, I then changed my vote to 1. This is simply outrageous. This animal abuse is a real shame for the movie as it would otherwise have been very good because of the moral paradox it brings up, and the very balanced way it presents the main character despite of what he does in the movie. However, viewers looking for black-and-white Hollywood style movies where the bad guy is portrayed as an ugly maniac and the good guys as angels are likely to be confused by Talk to Her. Unfortunately, the bull killing leaves me no other choice than to encourage everybody to boycott this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful, mind-expanding film in Spanish with subtitles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unconventional love story. Benigno is a nurse. He had spent most of his time taking care of his sick mother, and often staring out the second story window at the dancers in the street level studio across the street. In particular the lovely Alicia (very pretty Leonor Watling). He had no real time to try to establish a typical relationship with a lady, and some of his co-workers called him gay.Marco is a traveling writer who falls for Lydia, a popular female bullfighter.The story begins in earnest when Alicia is injured in an accident and is cared for, in a coma, at the hospital where Benigno works. We see them removing her clothes and giving her sponge baths, she is lovely indeed. The father of the young woman trusts Benigno because he thinks he is gay, but secretly is in love with her and volunteers to cover extra shifts to be near her.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Alicia misses a period or two and turns out to be pregnant. Benigno is the father, he is sent to a prison. Marco has become his friend and visits him. Benigno cannot stand to be apart from Alicia so takes an overdose which he hopes will put him in a coma to be with her. Instead he dies. Meanwhile Alicia has the baby and it brings her out of her coma. Marco ends up with the girl after his bullfighter girlfriend is badly gored and eventually dies also.A much better movie than a simple summary would indicate. The critic Ebert has a good summary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Animals should not be sacrificed!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to this movie, until I found that 6 bulls were tortured and killed to make this one. Now I refuse to watch such a barbarity and I hope other people will follow my example. The sacrifice of animals in cinema is not allowed in many countries (including the USA) and great movies still come from those countries. Was it mandatory that 6 (six!!!) bulls had to suffer for hours until they were finally exhausted and dead for the sake of a movie? I expected more from Almodovar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half of the movie is REALLY interesting RATE 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie follows two separate stories of men in love in their own ways. The first is a writing who falls for a woman bullfighter. The second obsesses about a dancer from across the street. The bullfighting story is lack-luster, unemotional, and is over half-way through the movie. The other is original, powerful, and centers on a great performance. That is why I give a rating of 5 (10 for one, and 0 for the other).It's too bad that the first half of the movie is wasted on the bullfighter. There is some interesting scenes of bullfighting, but everything else was a lost. I was bored, and almost gave up on the movie. Then, the other story starts to kick in.There is only one problem with the obsessive male nurse. Without giving away the ending, I still have many questions about what happened at the hospital with the dancer. It wasn't completely spelled out. I think it needed to be spelled out.SUGGESTION: Cut short the bullfighter story line. Expand on the hospital scenes. Maybe add more scenes with the male nurse and female nurse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing experience, a potential not used</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie tells about Benigno and Marco, two men whose girlfriends are both in deep comas. These two men become friends at the hospital where Benigno works as a nurse taking care of his so called girlfriend. Suddenly also Marco falls in love with Benigno's girlfriend and while they're sharing a special friendship things lead to another. This movie has every single ingredient to be an amazing movie, the story is very unique, compelling and beautiful, a great story indeed. Does the movie use all those ingredients? No, it doesn't. It has been said about Pedro Almodóvar that he is a true artist, being the writer and the director of his movies, making provoking and unique movies everyone falls in love with. I've seen a couple of his movies before and I must admit that I'm still not impressed."Hable con ella" has one huge problem, even a mistake which Almodóvar's movies suffer from; They're boring. Everyone's praising this movie and let me just ask you why? Or why can't I see how great it is? I've only come to one conclusion which almost everyone knows already and that is that Almodóvar's movies are not for everyone. Certainly not for me. They have this certain style, which some describe as beautiful and some just don't understand it. I guess I'm one of those who just don't understand. I liked the story of "Hable con ella" a lot, it interested me and that's why I wanted to see it. I was very disappointed, as the whole movie is just boring. Plain boring. You could describe the movie based on the very first scene, which to me was horrible, the whole movie follows the same pattern making almost all of the scenes too long and giving that overall feeling of total dullness. I'm not going to stuck on the first scene but those who have seen the movie know what I'm talking about. It's almost irrelevant. I don't want to sound too harsh, as the movie actually has its moments, but the progression to those moments are just backbreaking. You just wait for something to happen and when something finally does it comes and goes, simple as that. What comes to directing, well it's obviously very Almodóvar. This was probably the last time I watched a movie of his, as obviously his movies are not for a guy like me.There are other things I like about this movie besides the story, like I said above it has its moments. To me the characters of Benigno and Marco are great, though Darío Grandinetti's character Marco could do more with some more depth. I especially enjoyed Benigno's character in an odd way, played by Javier Cámara; The character makes you feel sad for him and it makes you despise him, genius in its own way I'd say. The character's likable and disgusting at the same time, and the building up of the character is brilliant. Sadly that doesn't make the movie exciting at all, giving it an enormous reserve of potential which should always be used, but in this case it isn't. The movie doesn't have any kind of flow.I don't know how could I recommend this movie to anyone, probably because I just don't like it. Almodóvar -fans will most certainly get what they want and they will be entertained, I just can't understand how. Maybe one day I will be watching an Almodóvar -movie again, just to see if something's changed but one thing's for sure and that is that it's going to be a long time after I'm ready for another one. This movie just sadly didn't impress me at all, a movie being in fact that one huge problem; Boring. It actually manages itself pretty nicely in every category, raising my final rating a lot, but the progression and flow which it doesn't have lets it down big time. A recommendation for the fans, not a recommendation for those who haven't liked Pedro Almodóvar's movies before. For those I say don't mind about the fans who say these movies are great and who despise us who don't, as there is actually a small group of us who still stick with their opinions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What makes this movie good?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know. I only watched this subtitled movie because I had heard it was nominated for some awards. I'm not sure why. I found it dull, not much happens, not to mention a guy rapes a comatose women who he has been obsessed with. At least it doens't show that in the movie. It just moves along slowly. And the title is a play on irony. There are two guys infatuated with comatose women. One talks to his love while the other can't stand to see his love laying there.FINAL VERDICT: This movie is mostly about one sick puppy who takes care of a girl in a coma who he watched as a dancer before her accident. It's just not entertaining enough to spend nearly 2 hours on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have another word for this so-called masterpiece; why do so many people call this dragon a great movie is beyond me!First of all *****SPOILER ALERT****** the story itself is too silly and utterly absurd and I absolutely fail to see the romantic side of it, or even the interesting side ?!? One (very weird and totally a-social) guy Benito stalks a girl (she doesn't want to have anything to do with him) then the girl gets in a coma and he becomes her nurse and caretaker (like he used to many years do for his own mother). He acts towards her as if she functions normally: he talks to her (this is also the movie's title : TALK TO HER), shows and tells her things and so on and even - as is proved later when the girl gets pregnant ? he has sex with her!Another guy Marco has an affair with a female toreador who also gets in a coma during a bullfight. He obviously has problems coping with all this. When he gets acquainted with the first guy, this one tries to give him advice in the matter: TALK TO HER he says! However, at a later point, it becomes clear that the toreador had returned to her ex-boyfriend already a month before the dramatic last bullfight. So this second guy leaves on a long trip to get away from it all. When he returns home he is surprised to find the first guy in jail for rape?.. Neigter of the two story lines are in any way romantic or interesting or even believable for that matter. I never felt any connection or sympathy for any of the characters in the movie and as for the pseudo-intellectual blab-la or artistic values of it?I also fail to see any of them! For instance the black-and-white scene with the "shrinking lover" is ridiculous and in a way disgusting! (and I liked the old SF-film THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN a lot; why this crazy and rather stupid scene in this movie??artistic? ?I don't think so).The whole movie is so utterly ridiculous, uninteresting and totally unbelievable that I am angry with myself that I didn't turn the DVD off before waisting 2 hours of my life! Almodovar is going too far; OK he made some good movies in the 80's (f.i. MATADOR and ATAME); so he probably now thinks he can get away with anything! And ?YES folks he can because most critics talk about "another great masterpiece", "his best movie ever" ??Oh it's SOOOOO sophisticated !? one must love Almodovar and everything he makes! Most audiences seem to go along and feel they HAVE to like it. HELL NO! I HATED THIS MOVIE 1/10 (0/10 would even be more appropriate)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the worst movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie last night and I think that it was one of the worst movies ever. The story line drags on about two men who form a somewhat freakish friendship at the hospital where the women they love are in comas. The male nurse is a sick person who should never have been allowed to be a nurse. There is also a disturbing sex scene that should make it so that the movie is taken off the market. Bottom line, SAVE your MONEY and TIME. RENT something DIFFERENT!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably on of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life, and i saw a lot of such movies. But only few of them are wrapped in pseudo artistic form like this one. In my humble opinion, Hable con ella has nothing to do with art, nothing to do with humanity (in a positive meaning of that term).On the other hand, because its provocatively sympathetic cinema language, Almodovar does not condemn dark side of humanity, or it does in an awful way. This is a text book of an overrated, very disturbing, meaningless, empty, pseudo artistic movie, with no plot, with no message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, i was subjected or rather, forced to watch this movie in a critical analysis Hispanic film class. I have heard people say that this movie is art, and that it explores deep and unexplored themes, however, all of this is lost because of the unnecessary sex and nudity throughout the entire film. I tolerated all of this of course, because i have to to pass the class. But this was absolutely the most vile film i have ever had the displeasure of viewing. There is no story line, no plot, no point, and the way i feel, is that it was a waste of 2 hours that i can never get back. I would say that although there are artistic elements to the movie, for example, Almodovars famous, film within a film, it is not worth watching. You come out of it in the end, knowing as little as you did going into it in the beginning.</fullReview>
