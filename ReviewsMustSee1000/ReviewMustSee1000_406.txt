		<shortDescription>The BEST martial arts movie EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is it. The single greatest Kung Fu movie ever made. This is the ultimate Kung Fu movie with the ultimate Kung Fu star, Jackie Chan. His entire career has culminated in to this one, great opus. Jackie performs feats of physical agility that will blow your mind, despite being about 40 years old when he made this movie. The story is about the fabled fighter Huang Fe-Hung who encounters corrupt industrialists that are exporting some of China's greatest historical treasures to increase their profits. Naturally Fe-Hung takes up the fight against them, and faces the deadly Ax Gang and finally a dangerous Tae Kwon Do stylist in the movies eye popping final fight scene. (That Tae Kwon Do fighter is actually Jackie's real life body guard. He stepped in as the chief villain because Ho SUng Pak hurt his ankle and was unable to perform the complicated fight sequences required.)Fe-Hung doles out justice throughout the film with his unique fighting style, drunken boxing, despite ridicule by his opponents, insisting that drunken boxing is inferior. Needless to say, Jackie proves them wrong.Historically speaking, the real Huang Fe-Hung did not use drunken boxing at all. In fact, he was a practioner of the much more effective style of Kung Fu called Hung-Gar. And his exploits can be alikened more to the Jesse James of America's old west. But Fe-Hung was more commonly found fighting for the underdog and battling tyranny. However, of all the innumerable depictions of Huang Fe-Hung "DRUNKEN MASTER 2" is by far the best.This movie can be described as a "Big Budget" Kung Fu movie, done in a very traditional period style. The cinematography, direction, action sequencing, writing, and story line are all TOP KNOTCH. There has never been a Kung Fu movie made that is "better" than this one. And there has never been better fight choreography.As you might well expect, there are some breath-taking stunts. And this is the movie that has the fire stunt responsible for Jackie's skin graft on his arm. He did not get burned so severly until the THIRD take! He wasn't happy with the first two. And if that is not painful enough to watch, then check out the fight against the Ax Gang, when one member gets knocked of the up-stairs portion of the restaraunt and slams into a cross beam before smashing in to the floor.If you are looking for the best martial arts flick ever, this is it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily one of the greatest martial arts movies in any place or any time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, Jackie Chan has had an interesting career. On one hand, he's made some classics like Project A and Dragons Forever. On the other hand, he's made some less-than-spectacular movies like Crime Story and First Strike. This movie is easily his best film ever...and also one the best martial arts movies ever made. He revisits the role that made him famous: Wong Fei Hung, the drunken master. The plot deals with smugglers trying to steal China's treasures, but in the end it isn't important. The fights are what matters, and Chan fights like a son of a gun. There are some excellent traditional fight scenes like him fighting Lau Kar Leung and one w/ a Choy li fut stylist. There's a memorable fight against an Ax Gang (Ax army is more like it). The finale, where he takes on the smugglers led by a super kicking Thai boxer, is probably the greatest fight scene choreographed. This movie doesn't cease to entertain. A must see for any fans of action, martial arts, HK movies, or just Jackie Chan himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw "The Legend of "Drunken Master" not knowing anything about it and it was a grwat suprise to find how good this movie is. I have new respect for Chan after seeing this film. The fights scenes in this movie are simply amazing, the final fight that takes place in a steel mill made my jaw hit the floor, it lasts for about 20 minutes and Chan does some amzing stunts. This is the best martial ats movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not completely convinced that this is this best kung fu movie of all time, but it's definitely in the Top 5. Being somewhat a purist, I was disappointed to see Jackie and others wearing wires in many of the sequences. However, the sheer energy and excitement of the fighting won me over. The use of wires adds to the humor and enhances the nature of the drunken style. It seems like the goal of this movie was to entertain, and it certainly achieves that!I first saw this movie during the US theater release. I was impressed and bought it as soon as it came out on DVD. However, I was shocked by the lack of a Cantonese audio track. The English dubbing appeared to make the movie seem goofy, not funny, and I was getting sick of it. Eventually, I was able to get the original Hong Kong version on DVD. There are significant differences which make the original better. As expected, the humor level is much milder and not so queer. Also, the US version now seems to lack the ferocity of the original. The Hong Kong version uses the `traditional' low-quality sound effects for the fight sequences. This detracts from the realism, but it's an integral part of defining any true kung fu `classic'. The US version now appears to be more like sparring than fighting because the hits appear much softer. Also, the original musical score was better than the US release. Don't get me wrong: I am not Chinese, nor a student of foreign film -- I'm not even a major Chan fanatic. But, if you have a chance, please see this movie the way it was originally intended. I believe you will appreciate it even more.Either way, I rate this movie a perfect 10 because I have not yet found a better fighting film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With Jackie Chan behind the production and the time to perfect it, Legend of Drunken Master winds up becoming a martial arts legend itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To describe Legend of Drunken Master is almost impossible. It has so much, it does so much, and it delivers in so many ways, you cannot really describe the experience. Legend of Drunken Master stands as Jackie Chan's best film, and arguably the greatest martial arts film in history. That's right Bruce Lee fanatics, it tops most/arguably all Lee films. Surely Lee had the strength and the power; but did not have the ensemble cast that Chan had, nor did Lee have any fights that can top the ones the Drunken Master engaged in throughout the 105 minutes of this kung fu madhouse.With a decent plot, good acting, and a dash of humor to go along with the frenzied action, Legend of Drunken Master is one of those rare complete martial arts films that do more than just throw fights at you. Honestly, there has yet to be a perfect martial arts film. Whether its bad acting, a weak plot, too much focus on action, a pointless romantic story attached, or way too over-the-top substance, there hasn't been a martial arts film worthy of being up there with the best films in the modern era. Jui Kuen II (as they call it overseas) is the closest to the complete package as you can get.We start the film off with Jackie Chan as the tough yet uncontrollable young kid by the name of Wong Fei-hung who accidentally takes a seal from British smugglers. The smugglers, also involved in overworking Chinese men in a factory resembling slave-like sweatshop of some sort, want the seal back. In the meantime, Wong's controversial fighting technique, drunken boxing, has been met by disapproval of his father, and wants him to refrain from ever using it. Drunken boxing also has a lot of competition and shun from others in the community. Chaos follows as soon as the British and their henchmen find out who has the seal, and vow to do whatever it takes to get it back and to spread fear in the community.The plot isn't groundbreaking, but its something different than the average martial arts film. While it still contains the themes of family, honor, respect, and dignity contained in most Chinese movies of this genre, the preservation of Chinese art is a concept not used often. Nonetheless, it works, as we see the traditional values of the Chinese being threatened by the more modern mechanisms of the Europeans. There is also a major issue with honor, as Wong's father is morally against drunken boxing, and hates it when his reputation is damaged even a little. The acting involved with the tension amongst Chan and his family is at times a bit overblown, but for the most part gets the job right.Jackie Chan is one of the few actors/actresses in modern cinema history that can both be taken seriously and lightly. We see Chan at his playful side, especially when he is drunk. But, take away the smile, watch him pose, and you will fear him. Seeing that look in his eye right before a major fight starts can send shivers down your spine, as you know he will not back down easy, and will use whatever technique necessary to take you out. His physical appearance isn't exactly intimidating, but his agility and amazing ability to be balanced and whip out an insane combo of punches and kicks remains to be matched by anyone else out there. The best of Chan is here in terms of acting, usage of props, and kung fu. Don't let his usage of props fool you, he can engage in a brutal victory without the use of any objects. Few Jackie Chan films prove this, but Drunken Master has its share of fights without any other objects floating around.The fights are what Chan is best known for, and the fights are where the film excels towards jaw-dropping levels. From the first fight, involving swords and extending from underneath a train to a nearby house, to the final fight that lasts over 10 minutes without exaggeration; Drunken Master will wow you, will keep you on the edge of your seat, and will make you almost jump back in amazement. Hollywood does not have enough patience to spend four months on one fight alone, which is why we don't see fights in action films like the ones seen here. The final fight, involving a well-trained kicker and Chan at his drunkest stage is easily one of the best fights in history?it's so well choreographed, so well-timed, and so brilliantly executed, that it deserves a spot on one of modern film's greatest achievements. Raising the bar for generations to come, the last fight mixes speed, agility, humor, combos, fast movements, and unbelievable stunts. In truth, all the clashes prior do the same, but this one puts all the others to shame.Bottom Line: Missing this film would be a travesty, especially if you enjoy a good martial arts film. This time its not Chan alone that makes the film; we have a good cast of characters and fighters, a decent plot, and never really drifts into an unbelievable level unlike most action movies of today. This is Chan at his absolute best; and this is famed director Chia-Liang Liu at his best. Almost a complete package in terms of quality and substance, Legend of Drunken Master is as close as you can get to martial arts perfection; and remains the greatest martial arts film of all-time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awesome movie! totally awesome fights!Ken Lo owned the **** out of this movie. His final fight against Jackie is awesome. Jackie plays WFH (the often portrayed Wong Fei Hung), a martial artist of great skill and also a drunken boxer. His father, also a master, dislikes Drunken boxing. The plot of this movie isn't all that bad, but you watch it for the action anyways and there's plenty to go around and it's simply astounding! It's a classical Jackie movie, with some silly moments and prop using during the fights, wicked stunts (some of which are (naturally) really dangerous) and brilliantly choreographed combat!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A martial arts' classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is all the more fantastic because it is, however loosely, based on fact. Chan is in one of his finest roles as Chinese hero Wong Fei Hung, fighting foreigners who wish to take artefacts out of China during the Ching dynasty.An appreciation of turn-of-the-century China does help, but even without it, the film remains incredibly entertaining. The kung-fu choreography is interwoven with a well-written story which should instil pride in any Chinese moviegoer.Even Chan's acting is excellent, as the young Wong Fei Hung who develops his "drunken boxing" style - a type of kung-fu which is aided by the consumption of alcohol. However, his father forbids his son's drinking, fearing that he will not know when to stop. His stepmother is encouraging, hoping to put her stepson on the map in the local community. The rapport between the characters is superb and realistically acted by the players. The martial arts' choreography here is among the best in any film.Of Chan's movies set in an earlier time period, Jui Kuen II must rank as his best. An excellent example of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how can you not like Jackie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jackie Chan is the trouble prone son of a local doctor and martial arts instructor. In an attempt to help his Dad avoid paying taxes on some ginseng he is bringing home for one of his patients, Jackie stows the root in luggage belonging to a local political official. When he attempts to retrieve it, he finds someone else digging in the same baggage and a battle ensues. Jackie is stymied at every turn, even when he uses his famous Drunken Boxing, but finally retrieves the precious package and makes it back to the train as it is leaving the station. Unfortunately as all Jackie Chan fans can figure, Jackie got the wrong box. It seems the official was smuggling out a famous Chinese artifact and the man who was going through the luggage was a special investigator trying to get evidence. This local official is using the factory in Jackie's town to hide all the other relics he has stolen and becomes enraged when he discovers the theft has been committed. He ships his men all over town searching and they final track down Jackie and his spitfire step-mother and try to steal the artifact back. Jackie is a ball of fire rolling through the group but is vastly outnumbered. His step-mother takes matters into her hands and begins throwing bottles of liquor at him since what could better help a master of Drunken Boxing than getting drunk. Jackie ends up beating the gang and disgracing his father in the process who has always told him not to use this style. His father knows that many practitioners of this style end up as drunks in the end and worries the same will happen to his son. Finally Jackie is forced into helping rescue some of his friends who are trapped in the factory. The battle that follows is a dazzling display of Drunken Boxing at it's finest. This movie succeeds at all levels. It doesn't promise any hidden agenda and fail to deliver. It promises a martial arts packed movie with dazzling stunts and comedy to boot...and it works. Jackie was trained in the Hong Kong Opera at an early age and his talents are never more on display. The opening fight which takes part under a train is something that must be seen to be believed. The two combatants use a spear and a sword in their battle and basically are in a crouch the entire length of the car. Subsequent scenes incorporating the drunken movies are both hilarious and awesome in the ease of the choreography. Another good point for this movie is the dubbing is better than any many I have seen. They even allow Jackie to dub his own voice which is something that doesn't always happen for English speaking foreign actors. As usual with a Jackie Chan movie you must also watch the deleted scenes that are shown during the credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing Chan vehicle; one of his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jackie Chan shows off (and delivers) the goods in this film. It follows a tradition of Chan starring movies in America (Rumble In the Bronx, Supercop, Supercop II, First Strike, Who Am I, Operation Condor and Operation Condor) that were hits in China some time ago and have been re-released here (in fact, except for Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon all of Chan's films are China made). This is one of his best. The plot follows Chan as a young man who is a master in the art of drunken fighting (drinking before and druing a fight to gain action) who has to go up against art theieves and family betrayers. This plot is somewhat thin, and the dubbing makes The Crippled Masters look like Das Boot. But, the entertainment factor kicks in, and we see terrific fun. Only liability: this is a remake of the film that originally made Chan a celebrity in China, but in this film he is playing the same character (and he's 40). But still, it is a good enough film to almost not notice. A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I may be wrong about this, but I think Chan is responsible for the avalanche of ironic performance fights we have now.Here's the deal: movies need to be cinematic and fights are cinematic so we have them.Movies fall into two rough buckets: various concepts of sincerity and those that have (incorrectly as it turns out) been conflated under the concept of irony. Anything that exists in the first eventually has a sibling in the second; that's the way the world works.So if you have fights, even elaborate kung fu productions that are sincere, sooner or later someone will figure out how to annotate them. Chan was the guy that found a way to turn fights into a show and at the same time produce a simultaneous commentary that says: "watch this, its funny." To do the annotation, a requirement is that first level be excellent. Chan IS an excellent fight performer, and key to this awareness is the much publicized fact that no cheating is done on the effects. But he also a great humorist as well.This particular film isn't the turning point for all fight irony that follows. That was much earlier, but this is probably the best and most explicit.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has pretty much a lot of the good ingredients of a Chan movie but doesn't exactly live up to the prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Jui kuen II' is another funny Jackie Chan film with some great action scenes that were both skillfully shot and impressively performed. It has its share of funny moments but much of the comedy seems forced to the screenplay and lack the charm of its prequel 'Jui kuen'. The plot is very predictable and clich?d. The set designs, particularly Wong's house have been nicely decorated. The background score is pleasant. Jackie Chan pretty much plays the same character as in most of his films but he's still fun to watch. Anita Mui deserves special mention as she provides the funniest moments and is a delight to watch (even though it felt slightly awkward to see her cast as Chan's mother). So for me what stood out in this film are the brave action sequences (particularly the one at the end) and Anita Mui. Otherwise it's quite an average film as I did not feel as entertained as I would expect when watching a Jackie Chan film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Part sitcom, part period tale and all action. This movie is actually superior to CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON in cinematography and stunts. No wires here (hidden or otherwise). Though Jackie Chan will never winany acting honors (his repetoire consists of roughly three expressions), the lady who plays his stepmother is a real find (think Lucille Ball). This would be a "10" with better dubbing and if Chan had been believable as a young man. This is a movie I'll proudly add to my collection, and watch at least once a year just for the stunts, the beautiful cinematography and the terrific martial arts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unstopped action movie with impressive and rousing fights by the great Jackie Chan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Raymond Chow-Golden Harvest production with plenty of action , humor , lots of stretching and fast kicking . It deals with a young martial artist named Wong Fei-Hung (Jackie Chan's role is supposed to be half the age the actor was at the time of filming) going back home with his pacifist father (Lung Ti is only eight years older than Jackie Chan who plays his son) after a expedition and he meets at a train a veteran expert fighter . After that , he is caught between respecting his dad's orders or detaining a bunch of ambitious foreigners from smuggling precious objects . Meanwhile , Wong aware a style of fighting called "Drunken Boxing" , a strange and engaging kind of struggle . Unfortunately , his daddy is opposed to it , let alone drunken boxing . Ultimately , Fei-Hong not only has to face off against the disrespectful foreigners , but he has to overcome his dad's opposition as well . Entertainment , comedy and amusement abound in this exciting story , culminating consequently with overlong and spectacular fights in the enemy headquarter of the nasty band led by a foreigner ambassador along with his evil thugs .Hong Kong action comedy full of over-the-top struggles , excitement , thrills , ingenious stunts , slapstick , lots of fights but with abundant humor and tongue-in-cheek . This bemusing movie is packed with adventure , intrigue , unstopped action , and overwhelming stunt-work , in fact , the seven-minute fight at the end of the film took nearly four months to shoot , Jackie Chan indicated that one day's filming typically produces three seconds of usable film . Jackie Chan is top notch as one army man fighting a group of heinous villains and as always he makes his own stunts like is well showed . Awesome , incredible stunts and brief comic touches , as usual ; the picture is better constructed than Chan's predecessors films . The lighting-paced storyline slows down at times , but frantic action sequences make up for it . Spotlights movie include spectacular brawls , including bounds and leaps , impressive and interminable fights , a breathtaking final struggle between Jackie Chan and enemies . Jackie Chan actually crawled over the burning hot coals two times , he felt he "didn't have the right rhythm" the first time he did it . In addition other fine action sequences in overwhelming style . This is an acceptable action movie distinguished by nicely cinematography of the spectacular sequences , and contains agreeable sense of humor such as previous entries . Jackie Chan usually forms couple to notorious actresses as Maggie Chung and Michelle Yeoh . In this outing Jackie teams up again to prestigious Chinese actress Anita Mui , who plays his stepmother , a fine action star in their own right but sadly she early died by cancer . Both of them starred together several films such as ¨ Mr Canton and Lady Rose¨ and ¨Rumble Bronx¨ .The ¨Wong Fei Hung¨ role is a Chinese historic character who has been played by several actors , as Tak Hing in numerous films , the same Jackie Chan in ¨Drunken monkey in the tiger's eyes (1978)¨ and Jet Li in ¨One upon a time a hero in China¨ series , ¨Dr Wong in America¨ and recently Sammo Hung in the recent version of ¨Around the world in 80 days¨ also starred by Chan . ¨Jui Kuen II¨ is a good action movie distinguished by fight sequences , noisy action and packs silly sense of humor as well as Jackie's subsequent entries . The picture achieved big success in China and all around the world . However , Jackie Chan's failed at Box-office in his American debut ,¨Battle creek brawl¨ . Chan is a hard-working actor and director throughout his long and varied career . Chan usually pays overt homage to two of his greatest influences as Charles Chaplin and Harold Lloyd . He went on playing ¨Cannoball¨ , ¨The protector¨ and "Rumble in the Bronx", until getting all American success with ¨Shangai Knights¨ , ¨The tuxedo¨ , ¨Around the world in 80 days¨ and ¨Rush hour¨ trilogy , and the recent ¨Karate kid¨. Of course , his biggest hits were ¨The Police story¨ series that won the Golden Horse Award, a Chinese version of the Oscar , the first was titled ¨Police story (1985)¨ directed by the same Chan , it was a perfect action film for enthusiastic of the genre ; the following was ¨Police story 2 (1988)¨ also pretty violent and with abundant humor touches . It's followed by ¨Supercop¨ or ¨Police story 3¨ and finally , ¨Police story IV : Crime story¨ . The picture is well produced by the great Asian producer Raymond Chow and Golden Harvest production and compellingly directed by Chia Liu and completed by Jackie Chan . Rating : Acceptable and passable , the picture has its sensational moments here and there , but also with abundant humor touches mostly provided by its agile star , the super Jackie stunningly accompanied by Anita Mui and Lung Ti . It's a perfect action film for enthusiasts of the genre and especially for Jackie fans .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unmissable for any martial arts fan, this film contains what many regard as the best fight scene of all time, and I am inclined to agree, making this film unmissable for MA fans.The other fight scenes in the movie are almost just as good, the film features Jackie getting drunk and fighting his enemies using Drunken Fist which makes for hugely entertaining bouts.Unlike most of Jackie Chans movies, this doesn't have any stunts or any strictly comedy related antics, and instead is held up by the sheer quality of the fight scenes.Obviously the plot is completely irrelevant, and in this film it doesn't matter as the fights come thick and fast, and leave no chance you leaving you underwhelmed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If not a classic, at least classical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One has to begin by admitting the marvelous classicism of this film. There is no effort to seem "up-to-date" in the making of this film, it looks like it was made in Hollywood during the '50s or '60s. Very well staged and photographed.The troubled relationship between Chan and Liu Chia Liang came to an end at the safest place in the film - the moment when the general played by Liu dies. At any rate the tone of the film changes radically there, and some of the plot of the first half of the film gets lost there, the remainder of the film being a traditional Wong Fei Hung adventure. I.e., the story is traditional to the genre, but the film actually develops a more rapid contemporary pace. This is disappointing, since before Liu's leaving the film, it was really about the volatile relationship between Fei Hung and his father, Wong Kay Yi. (Wong's father, BTW, is played by Ti Lung in what may be the best role, and the best straight acting performance, of his career.) The stunts are rather subdued for Chan, and so is the comedy, although Anita Mui as Wong Fe Hung's step-mother is marvelous. But the Kung-fu is very neatly choreographed and packaged, so that we only get enough action to be pleased but wanting more. Such a balance is very difficult to achieve.Over all, an extremely entertaining martial arts film - even for those who don't like martial arts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young martial artist is caught between respecting his pacifist father's wishes or stopping a group of disrespectful foreigners from stealing precious artifacts.In 2005, "Drunken Master II" was named one of the top 100 best films of all time by Time magazine. Wow. It is good, sure, but one of the top 100 of all time? Would it even be in the top ten for martial arts films? Time magazine thinks so.Roger Ebert wrote, "When I did a seminar at the Hawaii Film Festival several years ago, comparing the physical comedy of Chan and Buster Keaton, martial arts fans brought in their bootleg Hong Kong laser discs of this film." This is an astute point. While they have a very different kind of genre from each other, Keaton and Chan are very much two sides of the same coin: comedy and action, through a complete control of their own bodies.</fullReview>

On the train, he goes to take back the ginseng and encounters someone stealing a similar box from the suitcase. The boxes are switched after a fight and Fei Hung mistakenly takes the Jade Seal of the Emperor. The British starts searching the train. Government official Cheung Hok Leung (Andy Lau) is able to save them from the search. It's a screwball attempt to cover up the missing ginseng with the help of stepmom Ling (Anita Mui) when they get back home.Jackie Chan is at his most fun. He is Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton combined. It's got kung fu action which he always adds his special brand of easy charm. It's got some great actors like the hilarious Anita Mui. The production level is quite good. The camera work looks sharp. This is a kung fu movie with a fun comedic sense and compelling story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A 40-year-old Jackie Chan proves that he still has what it takes to make the jaw drop to the floor with Legend of the Drunken Master, a period martial arts film that features not just some of the best fight scenes of Chan's career, but of kung fu cinema in general.Chan plays legendary martial artist Wong Fei-hung, son of kung fu master and physician Wong Kei-ying (Ti Lung). Returning from a trip to replenish their medical supplies, Fei-Hung tries to avoid paying taxes on a parcel of ginseng by concealing it in a British ambassador's luggage; but when he sneaks into the luggage compartment on the train journey home to retrieve his package, he grabs the wrong bundle, mistakenly taking a precious jade seal destined for the British Museum. This makes Fei-Hung the target of a Chinese master, Fu Wen-Chi , who is determined to avoid the antique from leaving the country, and also the evil British ambassador and his henchmen.What follows is an action packed comedy caper as our hero tries to hang on to the seal while keeping his promise to his father to not drink and fight. Of course, this proves impossible with numerous people trying to get their hands on him, and with drunken boxing as Fei-Hung's preferred style of fighting.As with many Chinese Chan movies, there's quite a bit of broad comedy, which, depending on your sense of humour, you will either find amusing or bloody irritating (I tend to lean towards the latter), and the plot is far from inspired, but it's the martial arts that makes this truly unmissable, actor/director Lau Kar Leung capturing Jackie and his co-stars at their absolute best. An early fight between Fei-Hung under a train and a station platform quickly sets the bar extremely high, but that is eclipsed by a fun exhibition fight in a fish market and a spectacular brawl against countless axe wielding gang members in a restaurant (with bodies regularly falling from great heights).The best, of course, is saved for last, with a blistering battle that takes place inside a steel mill and which has to be seen to be believed, the scene making good use of the surrounding props, with steel bars, flaming coals, chains and flammable liquids all playing a part. A one-on-one between Chan and high-kicker Ken Lo is my favourite part of the whole film: amazingly fast, with superb choreography in which the star performs some incredible acrobatics, this is so good that its impossible to do justice with mere words. Do yourself a favour and just watch it for yourself now! You can thank me later.8.5/10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film of Jackie Chan's Career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Legend of Drunken Master" was the long-awaited sequel to the 1970's classic "Drunken Master." Let's get this out of the way: "The Legend of Drunken Master" is a masterpiece. I think it is Chan's best film, better than the original, and one of the best sequels ever. Jackie Chan is back in the lead role, and better than ever. Chan is known for his talents in both comedy and Martial Arts. Both are here in abundance, and are superb. I had never laughed this much in a Martial Arts movie before. The fight choreography is absolutely fantastic. Chan shows off his skills like never before, delivering some of the most thrilling action sequences ever. The supporting cast does a very good job, with Chan's character's stepmother being the standout. Everything about "The Legend of Drunken Master" just screams greatness. This is definitely worth a look from all action fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Returning home with his father after a medicinal expedition, Fei-Hong gets caught up in the battle between outsiders who want to export ancient Chinese artifacts, and the loyalists who don't want the pieces to leave the country. Fei-Hong has learnt the style of fighting called Drunken Boxing, which makes him a dangerous person when under the influence. His father is opposed to any kind of fighting, let alone drunken boxing, but Fei-Hong not only has to fight against the outsiders, but he must overcome his father's antagonism......The thing is with Jackie Chan movies is that story comes second the barrage of balletic choreography that is on display for all to see.And again, the story here is your perfunctory tale of big people trying to overthrow the little people, and just as they are trying to make a stand to the man, Chan shows up right in the middle of it, and gets caught up in it, much to frustration of his father.So it's a good job then that the film doesn't really give you time to think about the flat narrative, as the action scenes a wonderful, and show you that not only is Chan this generations Buster Keaton, or Charlie Chaplin, he is an elegant fighter.Every fight is wonderful, and really brings the film back to the surface of affable.If you are a fan of the star, this has to be one of his better efforts since the nineties, and puts all his Western movies to shame.Hollywood just didn't know what to do with him, scaredy cats....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where Jackie Chan's Fighting Skills Stand Out Above The Rest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Next to Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan stands out as one of my favourite action movie stars in cinematic history. "The Legend of Drunken Master" truly showcases just how flexible and high-flying Chan is in one of his best martial arts action films out there (even better than the "Rush Hour" series). You have to see this with your own eyes if you want to catch my drift. This movie has one enjoyable scene after another. The simplistic display of storytelling will keep you intrigued along with the heart-pumping action, wonderful comical moments and a very tantalizing plot. The characters are very rich and vibrant like the comical performance from Anita Mui as Wong's (Chan) step-mom Ling to the insanely antagonistic bad guy Ken Lo as Jon/John. The casting decisions were well put together that adds dimension to the story and the characters. The story is about an iconic folk hero named Wong Fei Hung, a well- meaning, but naive student in the art of Drunken Boxing also known as Zui Quan. Even though he tries not to get involved when trouble is on the horizon, he becomes a witness to British thieves who are robbing rare priceless Chinese artifacts out of the country. Wong feels it his destiny to use his unorthodox fighting skills to prevent this happening.I know the concept of Drunken Boxing sounds utterly ridiculous, but it's anything but. When it comes to surreal fighting fight scenes, Jackie Chan is a master in this parameter. He makes these fight look real and very easy. And with all his movies, street-fighting appears all the time. But here, Chan's fighting is more aerial and flamboyant than compared to his other films and it's equally believable as the stuff he's done before in the past and present. The final showdown at the factory has lots of wonderful action, it's enough to make any action junkie's mouth water. Jackie Chan is not alone in this movie. The supporting cast turn in some very enthralling performances as well. Wong's parents Ling (Anita Mui) and Wong Kei Ying (Ti Lung) are exciting to watch because they are very contrary to one another. Ti Lung is loving and caring father who wants best for Wong, but still believes he must inflict tough love on him. Meanwhile Ling is the more spontaneous step-mother who has good sense of humour, while still protects her son from getting into trouble with his father. The polar opposites between each other balance the movie quite substantially. The fight scenes are some of the most intense I have scene in martial arts action films in cinematic history. One of the most memorable fighting scenes in this movie is when Wong and an associate take down every member of a large gang of hoodlums known as "The Ax Gang". I could elaborate further with this scene, but it's the exciting climax at the factory that really cranks up the heat as Wong takes down an army of bad guys before taking down the main kingpin. Jon/John is played by Ken Lo. This guy is equally talented of a fighter as Chan and was great formidable opponent for Wong. His kicking ability is enough to put his own arms out of commission. Most of the fight Lo is kicking Chan's can all over the place. At one point his kicks lands Chan into some flaming coals and like every time Chan succeeds in keeping it real.That scene along will likely make your jaw drop. Then like when Popeye eat spinach, Jackie consumes some industrial beverage and regains his composure and manages to finish off his evil adversary which makes you wonder if fighting dunk has a better advantage than when you are sober. The final scenes are just truly amazing and exciting. I guess the drunken fighting is to take your opponent off his mark but are at par with the drinker. Chan pulls this stunt off without a hitch. The fight scenes were beautifully crisp and well choreographed so much that you only wished those scenes lasted for days. If you like martial arts action movies and you have never seen this one, what the hell are you waiting for? This is a high-ranking action film up there with other action movies of this calibre like "Enter the Dragon" and "Iron Monkey". Lots of well orchestrated stunts and fight sequences, this movie will keep you entertained the whole way through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drunk or not, this one is a winner.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You don't attend a Jackie Chan movie for the plot anymore than you watch 'Duck Soup' to see if Freedonia wins the war. You watch to see a comic master at work. Like The Marx Brothers and Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd the plot of Chan's movies is more or less obligatory, it is a clothesline on which to hang some amazing comic stuntwork and Chan has never been better then in 'The Legend of Drunken Master'.Made in 1994 but released in the states in late 2000, 'The Legend of Drunken Master' is Chan's best work of the 75 films that he has made. The reason, I think, is that care has been taken to make a movie that is as absolutely entertaining as any Jackie Chan movie can be. Watch the climactic fight in this movie and you will see martial arts as good as they get without help from the technical department.I have observed many times what makes Chan's action scenes work. I think it starts with the level of violence, there is a lot of kicking and slapping but no blood, no pain (except in the outtakes) and no dead bodies. Chan's characters never fight out of toughness but rather out of reaction. Fear always seems to drive Jackie to defend himself and like Fred Estaire he always uses whatever props are at his disposal from a hat rack to a chair, a refrigerator, a ladder, a wheelbarrow, a steering wheel etc. etc.The story of 'The Legend of Drunken Master' is really beside the point involving some business about a Chinese artifact and his art of Drunken Boxing which hinges on the theory that you can fight better when you are drunk. This gets him in hot water with his father but who really cares.The surprise in this movie is Anita Mui as Jackie's stepmother who provides a very funny comic performance with skill great and timing? her best moment comes when she is clipped in the jaw and speaks for a few minutes in a broken-jaw mush-mouth with her mouth cocked to the side. The women in these movies are usually dimwitted bimbos dragged along screeching but Mui is smart has real talent.I mentioned the climactic scene. It is the pure joy of watching a master at work and this one taking place inside a steel mill with Jackie and his adversaries fighting will all manner of fire implements and hot coals is Chan's best work. And just in case we have any doubts, every one of Jackie's movies closes with a series of outtakes showing Jackie getting hit, burned, punched etc. He may not be making movies that will change the face of cinema but here is a guy, literally, hanging his neck out for his art.NOTE: I like watching these movies with the English dubbing because it always seems to add to its tone which always seems to set the movie just an inch off the ground.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kung-fu entertainment at it's best! Thanks to Jackie Chan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first movie where I saw Jackie Chan using one of his most entertaining to watch fighting style...The drunken boxing. Now this sequel isn't as funny compared to his previous Drunken Master film. But it's more entertaining, has better direction and fights, and a more better put together story and characters. Jackie Chan performed every stunt in this film and his sacrifice is totally worth it. As a matter of fact this is one of Jackie Chan's most popular trademark movie of his. I remember watching this film for the first time when I was a youngster and being so thoroughly entertained by it. I started to imitate drunken boxing and found it to be the epitome of a fun kung-fu movie. Now I don't care if others claim this movie is overrated. This film alone should give Jackie Chan the right to leave a mark in kung-fu films history in my opinion. I also liked Jackie Chan's mother in this film, she was like the Chinese Lucy from "I Love Lucy". Anyways this is a Jackie Chan's masterpiece. Anyone that like Jackie Chan films or Kung-fu movies should check this one out. Heck if you like entertaining and enjoyable films in general check this one out.9.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend of Drunken Master! The Best Kung-Fu Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has ever doubted the legacy of Jackie Chan has never seen The Legend of Drunken Master, and they should go watch the movie immediately. You won't be disappointed. The Legend of Drunken Master is by far Jackie Chan's best movie. It's a truly masterful spectacle of kung-fu artistry, skill and power. The Legend is an awesome upgrade to the original Drunken Master. It has unbelievable kung-fu that will leave you in awe. The Legend of Drunken Master is one of the very best martial arts movies. While it isn't the best kung-fu movie, it has the best kung-fu action. I can think of a certain Bruce Lee movie that's damn good and better, but Enter the Dragon doesn't have as great of kung-fu action as The Legend. There's plenty of worthy kung-fu fight scenes in The Legend of Drunken Master - the beginning bout between Wong Fei-hung and Master Fu Wan-Chi outside the train and underneath it is extremely good, towards the middle the big brawl at the eatery when Wong and Master Fu fight against those 50 or more members of the Axe Gang is so good, and of course the end fight of Wong Fei-hung versus Low Houi Kang in the fire refinery is inconceivable cinema, entirely epic and the best part of the movie. The battle of the end of The Legend of Drunken Master is one of the very best action scenes I've ever seen, not only martial arts fight scenes. Jackie Chan is awesome as the Drunken Master. Wong Fei-hung unleashes a ferocious beating using his legendary drunken boxing style kung-fu, all while he's severely getting the living hell kicked out of him. This movie's great all for its awesome action, and the rest of the story isn't bad by any stretch, just not very great. The script is comical at almost every opportunity in which a serious moment isn't needed, which I think works good for the weaker plot it has. The Legend of Drunken Master shows a large amount of kung-fu movie formula in a higher quality standard. Jackie Chan's martial arts is amazing as his stunts are too. The Legend of Drunken Master may be critically an 8, but it has the feel and it hits you like a 10! The Legend of Drunken Master is so awesome and epic! Watch it to see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just add a lot of scotch with your martial arts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a Jackie Chan movie made by his Hong Kong producers. Jackie Chan directed this movie himself (as he seems to do a lot) so all the bizarre stunts that he does, he does because he chooses to do them. This movie is not a movie sponsored by American money, as was Rumble in the Bronx, and thus has all of the typical quirks of Hong Kong Cinema.Jackie Chan, his brother, and his father go into China to get hold of some ginseng. As they come to the border post they realise they must declare the goods so they smuggle it on board through a British ambassador. They then must get it back so they sneak into first class and take the package. Unfortunately there are two similar packages and they take the wrong one. They also confront another martial artist who wants the other package. Through this they uncover a plot by the British to overthrow the Chinese Emperor (or so it seems).As with typical movies of this sort, there is little in the way of deep, in-depth thought. Jackie Chan is about stuns and martial arts, and you get plenty of that here. The interesting thing in this movie is the portrayal of the British. They have their guns while the Chinese have their martial arts. Even with their skill, they are under the yoke of the gun. But when the Chinese get the guns, they discard them in favour of the martial arts.The specific martial art that Jackie Chan uses here is what is called Drunken Boxing. He is reasonable, but very beatable sober, but when he gets drunk he becomes invincible. Thus, when he finds that he is fighting a fight that he probably will not win, he seeks as much alcohol as possible and becomes blind drunk.This is a reasonably good movie, and as typical for Jackie Chan, quite funny as well. When you watch it though, make sure that the version you have has reasonable subtitles, because it is really annoying watching a movie when you don't know what is going on because you cannot understand the dialogue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great action sequences-and Jackie Chan pushed his stunts perhaps beyond the point of where he should in this-all in the name of making a good flick. Dialogue choppy dubbed in English, probably better to watch in Chinese with sub-titles. There is a tendency to be overly goofy in this movie, which mars it a here and there but fundamentally it is an excellent martial arts movie. I think some western audiences will think JC a fool for is over acting, but I think that is a form of cinema that is supposed to look that way, like a Chinese version of slapstick complete with slapping, kicking and throws. It is sometimes ridiculous, but then again, so is life at times. I only gave it a six because I think it was in fact perhaps a bit too goofy, despite the deliberateness of it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drunken Master II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only real detriment to me as I watched the exhilarating Drunken Master II was the dubbed version I had to endure. Besides that and a rather mediocre story which, let's face it, is merely fodder to feed to the amazing martial arts sequences, Drunken Master II sure held my interest particularly Chan's climactic battle with Low Houi-kang(..as the corrupt Chinese business partner working with evil British Embassador attempting to steal a precious jade seal from the Great Wall, among other artifacts, raping the heritage of the people)in the Steel Mill. Also phenomenal is the tea house action sequence where Chan and Liu Chia-Liang(..as Master Fu Wen-Chi, attempting to retrieve the seal from those wishing to confiscate it)must defend themselves against the "ax army"(..this includes a terrific use of a splintered bamboo stick)where plenty of bodies are thrown through windows and tables, with stairs that are collapsed. The scene where Jackie Chan actually moves through hot coals is a hair-raiser..now this is dedication! Jackie Chan returns to the role of Wong Fei-hung, the son of a renowned martial artist, Wong Kei-ying(Lung Ti), whose fighting skills improve the drunker he gets! And, let me tell you, his unusual fighting techniques are something to behold! Anita Mui lends comic support as Mrs. Wong, Fei-hung's mother, herself a bit of a troublemaker who often motivates her step-son into action. The mistake of substituting a banzai tree root for a ginseng root is just one of several ordeals the two get themselves into..and this causes the one who uses it for tea to get deathly ill! I must admit, though, that asking us to accept her as Chan's motherly figure is a bit much, but they have wonderful scenes together on screen.Anyway, the film also shows how the steel mill is being used by those in authority to overstep their bounds, by forcing the steelworkers into overtime and lack of pay. Over the steel mill is the slimy British ambassador stirring up the problems plaguing the Chinese people. The ambassador also wants Kei-ying's Po Chin Lam school and grounds so he'll do whatever it takes to secure the property for his own financial purposes. All this is to develop those enemies we are to loathe and it doesn't take much to root for Fei-hung, drunken or otherwise. 1994 was pretty much Jackie Chan's coming out year, attracting the same western audiences as Bruce Lee had done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie's credit reads like who's who of HK cinema with Eric Tsai and Karina Lau directing, and Anita Mui and Yvonne Hung also lending their talent. The movie has no connection to the original drunken master's plot and is a completely new story.I liked drunken style of Jacky Chan better in the original than in this one. What I liked the most about the movie was Anita Mui and the coffee shop ladies who were her mah-jong friends. Anita Mui was so cute and charming in this movie, and in my opinion, she stole the show. And the coffee shop ladies she was with are gorgeous with Yvonne Hung being one of them. It'll be a shocker to see ladies like this walking down the street if it was in real life.Maybe the reason why I don't like this movie as much as the original is Jacky is not the one playing the comedy here. It's Anita Mui who's doing all the comedy, and oh, she does one heck of a job. After seeing this movie, I realized her loss was great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a massive Jackie Chan fan. I have most of his films, and this has to be one of my absolute favourites.The film is choc-full of memorable fights, and incredible stunts, some of which may cause you to yell out at the screen in mental anguish. The most incredible stunt has to be when Jackie is pushed onto white hot coals, and has to crawl backwards across the pit (apparently, he did this twice - ever the perfectionist).The storyline is never the reason anyone would be gripped by a Chan film, but in this case, it's basic, yet more than acceptable.The drunken boxing style is given a good go in this film, with Jackie demonstrating the style to magnificent effect. Watching this film, you certainly get a feel for Jackie's creativity and incredible ability to pull off some of the moves that simply no one else can perform. The sheer brilliance of some of his work in this film suggests that Chan never faltered from his quest for absolute perfection.Overall, if you're a fan of Chan, then you'll probably adore this film. If you're a casual Chan fan (ie Rush Hour, Shanghai Noon) then this film will surely lighten up your knowledge of just how amazing this martial artist is.</fullReview>

The U.S. directors don't know action if it bit them on their behind.I highly admire and am stunned watching Jackie Chan's drive, ambition, and productions.While the first half of this movie is a bit slow, the time is used for great character development and to establish the plot line. The second half is classic Jackie Chan action, great plot, and many laughs. And the infamous fight scene with Ho Sung and Chan's bodyguard.I was actually a bit impressed with this one, the first time I saw it.Get through the sometimes slow first half, with horrible dialog, and dubbed voices, to enjoy the action-packed fast-paced, all out rousing second half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackie Chan's return to classic martial arts film was a film filled with behind the scenes stories. Simply put Chan and his director fought, which maybe good for us since the result is one of Chan's better movies. The premise is that the drunker Jackie gets the better fighter he is. Of course there are plenty of opportunities for that to happen. The title Legend of the Drunken Master is actually a retitling since the film is a sequel to one of Jackie's first and biggest hits. Called Drunken Master 2 in the rest of the world the film was bought by Miramax who retitled it and cut out some of the film. I have a copy from a Chinese laser disc from its original release and for the most part I can't see many differences, though there is one very telling change.SPOILER In the end, Jackie drinks impure alcohol for lamps in order to fight the bad guys. The American version changes the ending so that there is no mention that the impurities have rendered Jackie blind, the final shot being Jackie with dark glasses staggering around.END SPOILER Ultimately it makes no difference since the film is quite good, lifted by some amazing action sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do yourself a favor and hunt this down -- you won't be disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jackie Chan returns as Wong Fei-Hung, the folk hero he took to stardom in the first Drunken Master movie. While helping his dad bring back some medicine, Fei-Hung accidentally switches packages with a mysterious old kung fu master (Lau) and obtains a rare Chinese artifact. Eventually, Fei-Hung finds out about a smuggling ring taking some of China's most precious treasures and decides to try and stop them.This was Chan's first "traditional" martial arts movie in about 10 years (after making cop pictures like Police Story), but Chan clearly hadn't lost a step. Not only is Drunken Master II his best traditional film, it's his best movie period. Watching this movie for the first time is a thing of pure enjoyment. The plot develops at a breezy pace; you never can really dwell on facts such as Fei-Hung's mother (Mui) looks younger than him. Speaking of Mui, she's a refreshing change of pace from the airheaded females featured in recent Chan films. She steals the show in every scene she's in as Fei-Hong's wise-cracking mah jongg-addicted mother. Ti Lung also gives a believably stern performance as Fei-Hong's exasperated dad.But what's a Jackie Chan movie without action? Believe me, once you see the fight scenes in Drunken Master II, most others (even Chan's) pale in comparison. Words cannot do these masterpieces justice. If the climatic fight between Fei-Hung and two thugs (played by Ken Lo, Chan's real-life bodyguard and Ho Sung Pak, the model for many of the characters in the popular "Mortal Kombat" video game) doesn't get your pulse going, you must be dead or severely intoxicated. Supposedly, the fight took months to film and it shows. Chan has never looked better.Do yourself a favor and hunt this down -- you won't be disappointed."</fullReview>

But what makes this worth of time is the legendary fight Jackie vs. His Bodyguard. For me the fight is the best ever topping even my all-time favorite film Enter the Dragon. I feel like the entire world has been robbed when Jackie kind of retired. The acting in this film is good. Ho Sung Pak is awesome and should do more films. Its the fights that are worth watching and worth of your time.Sure there will never be another Jackie Chan but we have his films to keep him in the mix and when we have children his films are the right choice to show to them and find a great role model.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just seen this movie and i love it, i love his drunken master movies and they are great! i love the style he has formed and the action is just breath taking. Bits are dramatic and funny. i would like to add tho, that some of the goofs that i have read are completely wrong and i think you should have a more detailed look next time you judge things. For instance the scene where john kicks wong and the goof says that he changes sides when kicking wong, but in actual fact wong is still getting kicked on his left, the same left that john is striking at, it might of confused you tho because of the camera angle change but its clear to see. another was the goof writing about his burns. If you think real life, when you burn your hands the burns or blisters mainly wont appear on your hands at the exact moment your burnt, it takes a while for the wounds to show. but the person who wrote the goof, thinks they should be able to see the burns straight away. I'm just saying this to stop people thinking negative of this movie, coz its a great movie and it needs to be more noticed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not just about the fighting,,,,his physical skills are the best out there,,,hands down. The man was 45 years old or somethings and he was moving and performing his art better than a 25 year old,,, come on. Plus, the story has a goal. The acting is not bad, if u don't like it then thats your problem. The fighting is unbelievable. It includes almost all kinds of martial arts if you've noticed. Just see the movie. It's worth a look for real. Then you can say your opinion. The bottom line is, even if you hate martial arts, you will be blown away by this movie. Jackie has changed the rules of physics in this movie. LOL. You wont regret it. He's old school. He's the man with the plan. It took a long time to make too. A lot of effort was put in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of Jackie Chan's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a non-stop thriller. The plot begins as Jackie, starring as China's folklore hero: Wong Fei-Hong, accidentally takes the emperor's jade seal instead of ginseng. He realizes officials are trying to smuggle Chinese artifacts into other countries and then plans to stop it. His main quarrel is with a man named John [ Ken Lo ]. In real life, Ken is Jackie Chan's bodyguard, so you can see how well this man could fight. The ending battle is filled with excitement and action. I would think that both fighters are equal when it comes to kung-fu. The ending was a bit of a disappointment which wasn't as exciting as the rest of the scenes, but other than that, this was an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different Chan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you get your bucket of popcorn, sit yourself nicely in that leather channel and start up a DVD starring Jackie Chan what do you expect? I tell you what I expect: lots of jumping, lots of falling and lots of glass breaking.This movie is different. Its not filled with stunts, its more of a take on classic Chinese fighting movies. In this aspect it is disappointing and during a couple of moment I caught myself wishing somebody else was starring in this movie, so I would have lower stunt-expectations.But then again, who else could possibly play the Drunken Master as hilariously as Chan? No one. His face expressions when he's drunk are simply priceless. And Anita Mui is not far behind brilliantly playing the comic character of Chan's step mother.Even without the amount of stunts Jackie usually puts in his fights, they are beautiful nonetheless. And I mean it. Bruce Lee kind of beautiful. Add the hilarious situations to the mix and we got a winner.The movie might be different, but it only makes it more interesting. A must see for every fan of Chinese cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected the usual Jackie Chan affair when I inadvertently hired this movie (looking for the original Drunken Master). Instead this has become one of my favourite all-time movies.This movie has everything; humour, action, emotion, and most of it of the highest calibre. Anita Mui strikes an excellent rapport with Chan, eclipsing the rather amateurish comedy we have come to expect from a man who is far superior a martial artist. However, the action does not suffer and the fight scenes really have to been seen to be believed.The final battle is truly epic and must go down as one of the greatest on-screen fights ever created. It contains everything with spectacular moves, well placed humour, and even a superb twist as Chan's character Wong Fei-hung is saved by the power of alcohol. Amazingly, Jackie Chan makes the feat of improving through consuming alcohol seem not just credible, but almost realistic. The rage and suppression of pain certainly are traits synonymous with heavy drinking. The musical score in the final fight brilliantly supports the action.If I did have any complaints, they were minor. The storyline is a little weak, but in amongst the relentless action and humour there really isn't any way you could see that being improved. Sometimes the acting is very goofy but that's part of the nature of the film. Perhaps the main bad guy is not really introduced enough before the last fight so his combat abilities are not really as fearsome as they could be. Also the way the movie ended felt a little rushed to me.All in all, this was superb. My main issue is that I don't speak Chinese so sadly had to watch a dubbed version. I would have loved to have been able to understand this movie with it's original script and voices. Still that's no reason not to watch what is, in my books, one of the greatest action movies of all time. How did I miss this for 11 years?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgic return to a lost genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing I noticed when watching Drunken Master 2 is that this is no new wave kung fu film. This is no contemporary Jackie Chan film. This is an Old School kung fu movie just like the first. Everything from the mise en scene, extras and poor quality cameras is here. But this is a film made post Once Upon A Time in China when the kind of cameras used in Hong Kong were much better than the 70s. But this is what I love the most, it is a true sequel to Drunken Master. I was expecting a glossier film I admit but then that wouldn't be true to the first.The action in the film isn't exactly generic Jackie Chan either, according to Jackie, himself and the director Lau Kar Lueng disagreed on the direction of the film throughout. The last fight was actually directed by Jackie himself after Lau left. While there is is a noticeable change in the tone the fighting is still fantastic throughout. I might even be bold enough to say i prefer the earlier fights that were more toned down on Jackie's ideas than the final conflict. Throughout, the mix of extremely complicated Drunken Fist choreography and subtle wire enhanced comic moves is unique among Jackie's films and surpasses the original in every way. The references to Jet Li's portrayal of Wong Fei Hung are also a nice touch, on the odd occasion Jackie uses the open hand gesture that Jet Li's portrayal is famous for and I think it's a really nice touch.The plot is also true to the original, pretty weak. But that isn't why I watch Jackie Chan. His poetry is poetry of motion and anyone who disregards his movies for that reason is a fool.Over all I was so impressed I watched the film again without even a toilet brake. So good any martial arts fan should own it. Shame is in the UK you have to buy import copies. I suggest ebay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackie Chan is the legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my previous years as a movie-enthusiast, I always looked upon Jackie Chan with a certain skepticism. In many movies this martial-arts expert showed that he knew some cool moves. Films such as "Trouble in Bronx", "Rush Hour" (one and two), "The Tuxedo" and so on contained a great portion of nice fight-scenes, but nothing spectacular. Bruce Lee and Gordon Liu remained my favorites until this year. A friend of mine had dusted down some old VHS-cassettes and we sat ourselves down to enjoy fine 90's movies.In this very stack of films, there lay one very interesting movie; the legend of the drunken master. Drunken boxing has always been my favorite martial-arts style, and this time Jackie Chan would show us his skills. What I expected, wasn't much: A low-budget film, with a lousy plot and quite OK fighting. I was right about the two first, but on the third assumption I was just terribly wrong. This movie offers the best fighting-scenes I have ever seen. It was made earlier than all of the new box-office Jackie Chan films, but it contains so much better fighting.This movie is historical, and it shows which immense powers that lies in Jacke Chan. I am just surprised that he has not showed some of these mad skills in his later movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is no doubt STILL the best Jackie Chan's movies I have seen so far. I remembered watching it 10 years ago (was it?) and since then, have been waiting rather 'patiently' for the DVD to be released(well, have to admit that I did buy the VCD in the meantime). Finally I got my DVD (which is manufactured by Thakral). The video quality is not so good, but who cares! as you will get so engrossed with the wonderful fighting scenes that you will soon forget about the picture quality. This is a movie with great humour, great kung fu/fight choreography and a terrific cast! Anita Mui is one you will never forget once you finish the movie. It's a pity Lau Kar-Leung has to depart halfway into making the movie. He was magnificent in the fightings he had with Jackie. And the final scene with Ken Lo is mind-blowing. You have to see it to believe how good he is with his kicking.Anyway, I think I am going to rent the Code 1 version and see how good (or bad?) was the so call 'remake'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The peak of Jackie Chan's carrier (so far)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently bought the Chinese DVD and watched it all over again. This was easily one of the best movies I had seen in 1994. There are 2 different versions out, I saw the original Chinese version. Detractors of the movie probably saw the American version, or do understand Chinese culture. The fight scenes are easily some of the best ever made and I consider Drunken Master the peak of Jackie Chan's movies. It helps to have seen the first movie, but is not necessary.An interesting note: The original director was released over creative conflicts and Jackie Chan took over. The original director, went on to make Drunken Master 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fighting taken to a new level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Behold the greatest martial art movie ever created. And whom else but Jackie Chan to star in such a movie, hands and legs set ablaze, with humor prevailing at such a high rate you'll be sick by the end of the movie. Sick because you laughed too much, sick because you never thought such fighting was possible. But, remember, with Jackie Chan, everything is possible.Jackie Chan's antics as Wong Fei-hung is hilarious. Even funnier is Anita Mui, as his step-mother, who without doubt gets one of her finer roles in this movie. And the pair really works wonders on screen. The scenes involving these two are among the most hilarious I have ever seen in a movie, easily annihilating all those cheesy flicks Hollywood has unfortunately gotten us accustomed to. And the fine layer of drama is well done too, specially the tension between Wong Fei-hung and his father, Kei-ying (played by none other than Lung Ti). You'll have guessed it Jui kuen 2 has a great cast.However, let us not forget the real asset in Jui kuen 2 because, while the humor is here and doesn't once let us down, this movie is most of all an ode to martial arts. Stunts abound in this movie, and that's what makes it so great. Every little bit of action is an excuse for Jackie Chan to amaze us with his acrobatic skills and his slightly suicidal ideas (okay, maybe ?Slightly' is not a big enough word!).Speaking of which, some of these stunts are extremely innovative and unique. They seem improbable, but all the actors accomplish feats. For once, all the actors are great, and each one knows what he was supposed to do, and does so SUPERBLY. This is not just Chan's movie; this is a whole team's movie. You really get the feeling that the crew had really fun during it, and this shows in the movie itself (which again reinforce my opinion that you can make a lot out of nothing with a dedicated team).The fighting is among the best you'll see in a movie. There are quite a few of them in Drunken Master 2, but the final one, against Ken Lo (a 7-time free fighting champion, and a former Muay Thai champion) is mind-blowing. Even recent movies, with all their CGI effects and wirework, fail miserably to deliver a good fight scene compared to what you will see as Chan battles Lo in the most memorable duel ever. You just have to see Lo raise his legs and keep delivering powerful kicks to believe such things are possible.I love this movie! It's an incredible feat, and without doubt the one that exposed Jackie Chan as a humoristic and martial art genius (as a choreographer anyway). The drunken style is well put forward throughout the movie, albeit a bit exaggerated, but it's all done in a way to make you actually want to keep watching the whole flick. And this is one of the very few movies that can be watched again and again ? I actually stopped counting after some time.Upon watching this movie, non-fans will perhaps finally realize why hardcore Jackie Chan fans keep claiming his Asian movies are vastly superior over his more recent, Hollywood flicks. Even Rush Hour, in all its glory, fails miserable compared to Jui kuen 2 (besides, there's no comparison between Chris Tucker and Anita Mui ? I mean, Tucker is great, but Mui is a real legend). Jui kuen 2 is of my favorite movies, and time has changed nothing to its sheer brilliance. On the contrary, it makes me yearn for more movies of this ilk.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This ranks as my favorite Jackie Chan film of all time. The fights are amazing and the humor is great. Very cool that Ti Lung portrays Jackie's father in this film. Yet, more interesting the choice of the late and great Anita Mui. She portrays Jackie's mother. However, in real life she is fourteen years younger than Chan. This has been released here in the states as "Legend Of The Drunken Master". If you can find a copy of the original Chinese version with English subtitles I suggest that you do so. A great film all around to watch with your friends. Also, to pay tribute to the very lovely Anita Mui. She has left this world, but she will never be forgotten. Also, with Anita Mui and recommended: Heroic Trio, Magic Crane, Moon Warriors, Mr. Canton And Lady Rose aka Miracles, Executioners, and A Better Tomorrow III. No martial arts...however, her wielding an M-16 and twin .45 automatic hand cannons is COOL!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man Jackie Chan took control. This is a movie about famed hero to the people Wong Fei-Hung, who is a great chinese folklore hero similar to Robin Hood. Wong Fei-Hung has many movies based on him, the most popular would be Jackie's Drunken Master 1 and 2 and Jet Li's OUATIC series. Which both had Yuen Woo Ping on hand for choreo (Drunken Master and OUATIC 2).In this Jackie has to sneak to the back of a train to retrive some Gin Seng that he smuggled a board in some ones suitcase. Unfortunatley it is wrapped in the same kind of fabric as a Jade seal that Lau Kar Leung is stealing from Ken Lo, who's trying to smuggle out of the country. Jackie and Lau crosses pathes and have a bout under the train, under the stations dock and in Lau's hut. This all comes about when Lau mistakes Jackie as someone coming to check on the seal.... and Jackie pursues due to the fact that Lau hits him.This is how the whole story starts as we see Jackie earn friendship with Lau later on and is disowned by his father Ti Lung for Drunken Boxing which his mother Anita Mui puts him up to so that people will be interested at studying at Po Chi Lum.Fight after amazing fight. Which includes the famed axe fight in a tea house. and the explosive 20 minute finally against Ho Sung Pak and Ken Lo. I recommend just to see Ken Lo's crazy go nuts kicking ability and Jackie's drunken boxing finally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it's not the best martial arts movie i've seen, but it is so far the best Jackie Chan film i've seen.I've never liked Jackie's style (silly sound effects &amp; face acting &amp; humour), but it fits in this movie, for obvious reasons. It's a different kind of story about Wong, at points it seems like mockery of the issue, but in the end the movie handles the subject fairly maturely. The humour does get on my nerves in this one as well, though. But not all the time, like in other Jackie Chan films.The fighting scenes are terrific, very fast action, clever styles and a little bit of good humour in there as well. The last fight scene is almost too long in my opinion, but all and all they rock. It literally takes your breathe away to watch fast action like this, all i could think of was the amazing physical achievements these guys perform.Acting is solid, no problems there, the dubbing is ok although i was extremely ------ when i noticed the DVD only had the english audio track. Why can't we just get movies in their own language?I still think Jet Li does it better, but this one's a decent Chan movie.5/10</fullReview>

I was one of four white people in an audience of Chinese and saw first hand what Jackie Chan does to them. Forget Rush Hour, forget Shanghai Noon and definitely forget The Tuxedo, this is Jackie Chan at his best and his funniest. The last twenty minutes are better than anything I have ever seen in an action movie but the train sequence and the market fight are just as good. Is it the greatest kung fu film ever made ? I think so. Wires don't matter (Young Master used a lot of them) it's the quality of the fighter that counts (Jet Li can't walk through Hong Kong without a wire) Jackie Chan was at his prime in the early 90s and this proves it.

Although the tape was a dub from a laser disc, and quality was poor, I was totally floored by the incredible, acrobatic fight scenes! I had expected a movie similar to the original Drunken Master, but this is light years beyond that. With Jackie's character drinking more and more in each fight in order to be more 'powerful', his moves and fighting become more and more athletic and astounding. This movie is the source of many of the standard drunken boxing moves you'll find in most video games (Virtua Fighter 2 and 3, for instance). Can't recommend this movie enough!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drunken Master 2, one of my favorite Jackie Chan films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, several years ago my brother got me a wide screen, subtitled tape of this and I was really impressed. This is the best Kung Fu film Jackie has ever done and it is pushing up there on the list as one of the best ever. It is fun, funny and not at all mind numbing. It has some of the best choreographed fight scenes I have ever seen and it actually has a strong realistic plot, though it bears little resemblance to the real life of Wong Fei-hung. He has been lost in myth and the over one hundred movies that have been made about him.This movie is not of the caliber, class or for that matter genre of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but the fight scenes can hold up on their own [not as many wires : )] and in terms of quality and hard work it is way up there. And like Crouching Tiger you definitely need to watch it with subtitles. Many of Jackie's films convert well into English, but this one looses a lot with the translation. So if you can get a subtitled uncut version of this, do it and enjoy.I give this a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There will never be a better martial arts movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got this film years ago. A widescreen subtitled copy. The quality was superb but after watching the film well over fifty times it has become rather worn. But I just can't stop watching it. Drunken Master Two was an awesome achievement in a martial arts movie. A true classic. Yes Enter The Dragon was a breakthrough, and the original Drunken Master was a breath of fresh air. But this film can be listed on the all time great films. The stunning fight work and superbly tight editing that had been lacking in a lot of Jackies movies of the last decade was there to behold. All of the performances were stunning, and for all of those people out there who didn't like it because it used wires, get a grip. The wire work in the film was so underplayed that I have never seen it bettered anywhere. The energy and strength of the performers was exhilarating to watch, and the final scene had me gasping for air and hitting the slo-mo button on my remote. A stunning and beautiful film for true and new martial arts fans. It's jus t a crying shame that it never got a proper theatrical release in it's wonderful cantonese language english subtitled version that I have the pleaure of owning. Everyone must see this film, and everyone should lobby to get it a proper release. I for one would quite happily give up everything to do this. It is an absolute gem of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Action, adventure, comedy, you name it! It's all in Legend of Drunken Master! This flick is filled to the brim with everything you need to make it worth your while. There are some parts where you'll laugh your ass off and even cry! The fighting scenes are absolutely breathtaking and chill inducing. I tried and tried to get my girlfriend to watch it with me and she wouldn't because she's not a big fan of action movies. But we were both bored one night and I told her that we could watch Drunken Master. "Oh why not?" she said. So we put it on and she was just enthralled by it. I told her so. This movie is a MUST BUY for fans of the genre but anyone could enjoy it. It's very entertaining and has a VERY high replay value. I've only watched it 3 times so far but there are many viewings to come.  Jackie Chan is brilliant and comes into his own at the end. Anita Mui is absolutely hilarious as Fey Hong's (Jackie's character) stepmom. Chong (not sure who the actor is) is also hilarious as the servant. The storyline is pretty average but the character development and the action sequences make up for it. It's just pieced together so brilliantly it's hard to explain. What am I doing?! Just go out and grab it! You won't be sorry whatsoever!10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BEST JACKIE CHAN FILM EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone who likes "Jackie Chan" will tell that this is the best "Jackie" film. This film offers couple of fight scenes nothing amazing till the end!! The best fight scene that took about three month to film, where you see "Jackie" fight his real life bodyguard and a friend "Ken Lo". I can say "Jackie" is funny as yet deadly in this film. This film has the best action packed ending sense I saw "City Hunter". Also if you liked this film you should give the "Drunken Master" a try. I haven't seen "Drunken Master 3" so I cant say much except that it doesn't have Jackie Chan like the first two parts which were amazing. So go see this film today!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chan's best, and the best Martial Arts film in years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is Chan's best film and outshines every Martial Arts film ever made. I know it is a bold statement, but this movie must be seen to be believed.*Possible Spoiler* 'Legend' starts out simple enough, a father and son (Chan) are returning home to Hunan from a trip. But when his father's ginseng is mistaken for an ancient relic, Chan gets in over his head.What follows is the an orgy of fists, fighting, and fury in the best coreography in movie history as Chan fights off gangsters bent on getting back the ancient relic to sell to a British museum. The film begs to be seen, and must be seen, if not only for Chan's physical performance!I highly recomment this gem of a picture. It is a shame that it didn't win over Box Office appeal when it debuted in America in 2000. It has found a home on DVD, however. Hopefully more people will witness Chan's humor, charm, and acting abilities in one of his non-American films. If you have been witness to "Shanghai Noon" or "Rush Hour," prepare to see a whole new level of Chan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would just like to say that I have just brought the original Chinese version of this film on DVD and it is quite simply awesome. The final fight scene is the best scene ever in a film and Jackie Chan is simply brilliant. I believe that this film proves that he is better than Bruce Lee ever was. Jackie's real life bodyguard, Ken Lowe, who is also in the film is also a great martial artist and without him the final scene would never have been so good. I am not saying that this film is only good for the final scene, the whole film is brilliant and all the fight scenes are great. However the final fight scene leaves viewers with nothing else to think about. I urge everyone to watch this film when they get the opportunity. No other mark could be given to this film so ten out of ten</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See the Chinese version, not the US re-release!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wrote a very positive comment for this film a while back, and I stand by everything I said. But having just seen the newly-dubbed American version, I fear that people are going to get the wrong impression about Jackie Chan and about this film. The original version is amazing; the American version is terrible.Let's begin with the dubbing. Some people apparently cannot deal with reading subtitles, but dubbing is infinitely worse. Many of the jokes fall flat when audibly translated into English. I can't understand Cantonese, but delivery and comic timing can succeed across language barriers. By re-translating much of the dialogue and getting some lame English-speaking voiceover actors (other than Jackie himself), the non-action scenes are unbearable. I was particularly disappointed with the voiceover for Anita Mui as the mother. She was much funnier in Chinese. In addition, the score and all the sound effects have been redone, poorly. I can't understand why they would want to replace a good Chinese with a more generically Chinese, somewhat Americanized score. The change made me realize that the music is incredibly important in aiding the rhythm of the fight choreography. The new score fails to do that. And the new sound effects, while certainly less jarring to uninitiated viewers of chopsocky kung fu films, just fall flat. Sure, in the original some of the sound fx are entirely unrealistic, but that was part of the charm. It all fit together. But the new version stripped apart the ingredients and attempted to reformulate them in a manner more suitable for an American audience. In my opinion, something was definitely lost in the translation.</fullReview>

If anyone has seen this movie ,probably should not waste his/her time/money on watching martial arts movies as lame as "Romeo must die" or " Crouching tiger hidden dragon" because of their stupid mixtures of cheasy romance and highly commercial entertainment."The legend of drunken master" is truly a must see movie and I would give this movie the score 9.75/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackie Chan takes the "Drunk" out of Drunken Master!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, Jackie Chan shows why he is truly a master of martial arts. This particular film, released domestically in the United States &amp; Canada in 2000, is actually an older release from 1994. With Jackie Chan's rise in the USA, many of the major department stores (*ahem*) have taken to stocking some of Jackie's first films, usually putting them in their bargain bins. Thankfully, this movie rises above those productions of pure excrement. Obviously, everybody has to start somewhere, but let's watch Jackie as we know him now... not as he was back then, when he was just beginning to master the art of "acting" while bring primarily a martial artist. His acting still isn't the sort to win Oscars, but he is infinitely better than he was back then.As with many martial arts releases, the plot line here is rather thin. There are more zany scenes and crazy hijinks here to keep the average Naked Gun fan happy. But who cares! I don't watch a Jackie Chan movie for plot... I watch it for the fight scenes! This movie doesn't disappoint! While not up to the calibre of Enter The Dragon, Jackie Chan shows that he knows his stuff. Of course, you all know that Jackie does his own stunts, blah blah blah, he often injures himself while carrying out said stunts, yadda yadda yadda... and that's what makes him so amazing. Jackie flying through a plate glass window... Jackie fighting off six guys with a broken broomstick... Jackie falling down a flight of stairs... wait, that's Chevy Chase. I'm just glad there were no hovercraft in this film! When all is said and done, the fight scenes in this film are better than those found in most of his other films. They are quick, they are flawlessly executed, and they hit home. This movie doesn't have the big Hollywood multi-trillion dollar budget of Chan's recent films, so it has to rely on bare-bones, white knuckle martial arts.Keep an eye on Anita Mui as Chan's step-mother. There never was such a kniving and deceptive woman in the history of martial arts films, and yet so innocent and absolutely hilarious at the same time. Excellent stuff!Don't rent this if you are expecting a blockbuster martial arts film in the line of Shanghai Noon or Rush Hour. Rent it if you enjoy films which display excellence in martial arts, along with the typical martial-arts-style plot-line.My Rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From a land where honor and tradition reign, comes the legend of a martial-arts hero unlike any other. The "Drunken Master" can turn just one drink into devastation and humiliation for his enemies. His technique is fast, furious . . . and powerfully funny. Jackie Chan, the world's biggest action star, mixes high-proof action with a twist of his trademark humor as the renowned Wong Fei-hong, the young master of the "drunken" fighting style. When Chan mixes up his luggage during a train trip, he finds himself at odds with evil foreigners trying to steal sacred imperial treasures.Never before have such elaborate, acrobatic fight sequences been captured on film. As Jackie fights to save China's imperial past, he faces hundreds of ax-wielding villains, dodges fires, endures scalding coals - all with the charismatic style that made him famous.</fullReview>

This was also one of the funnier gongfu movies I have seen in quite some time. Anita Mui was DELIGHTFUL and provided an interesting and unpredictable comic angle. While the movie's few, brief attempts to be dramatic were a bit weak, it didn't really matter - since this was almost exclusively about ACTION and COMEDY.

		<fullReview>Most hardcore martial arts film fans try to separate themselves from the commercial and comical efforts of Jackie Chan, however "The Legend of a Drunken Master" (or "Drunken Master II" as I'm told it's called in Hong-Kong) is quite simply a film that no action/martial arts fan can deny and arguably the best martial arts film I have ever seen.Jackie Chan's stunts and seamless action sequences have always been pretty incredible, but this film is jaw-dropping. It also appears to be much more violent than his other movies and adds an element of brutality to his film's here not seen in North America since his "Rumble In The Bronx". The story, as usual, is pretty stupid. Chan is the son of some Martial Arts master, who happens to own and is located on land that contains priceless Chinese artifacts that some bad-ass Hong Kong gangsters and British diplomats want to steal. Chan practices and occasionally executes a fighting style known as "drunken boxing" (which involves a stagger step in which a fighter moves as though he was drunk.... although Chan shows us over and over again in the movie how much better this actually works when you really do get drunk to do it), but it is forbidden by his father, so if his dad finds out, he usually gets a beating or two. Anyway, Chan battles the gangsters and then takes on the whole damn mob after they take his father's land and shut down a factory. To tell you the truth, I don't think I can remember anything else about the plot, but that's not what's important here in the first place. What's important is that the action sequences here are so incredible that you have to see them to believe them. All the while, keep in the back of your mind that Chan is doing all of his own stunts and many of the other actors are, as well. The drunken boxing scene between the gangsters in the middle of town with a crowd gathered around and Chan chugging ample amounts of booze while smashing bottles on the gangsters and promptly beating the living daylights out of them is, in two words: Bad ass! And the 20-minute final action scene is easily the most incredible action sequence I have ever seen. You'll be amazed at how dedicated Chan is to his films and their realism once you see the punishment Chan's body took in that scene. It needs to be seen to be believed!All in all, this is one of the best action films I've ever seen. Not in story, that's for sure, but for sheer action, I really don't think you have much chance beating this film. Period! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Jackie Chan's finest films he's ever made is Drunken Master II (or The Legend of Drunken Master which is the US title). This film offers a lot of Jackie Chan doing physically demanding fight sequences as most of his films do, not to mention his death defying stunts to put the icing on the cake. This film was re-released in North America by Dimension Films with little attention, this should have got just as much publicity as Rumble in the Bronx or Supercop because Drunken Master is much better than both those films and it shows if you watch this one and compare to his other films. This film kicks ass and if you want heavy dialogue with an excellent screenplay, go watch Shakespeare in a theatre because this film is all action, Hong Kong style. My advice is:Go watch this movie or rent it at your local Asian video store because you're gonna miss Jackie Chan doing what he does best.Rating: $4.50 out of $5.00</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Legend of Drunken Master is a master work by a master performer. Jackie Chan gave us a movie which is both thrilling and technically excellent in fight choreography. While the film has some problems with continuity and non-fight scene editing, the fight scenes and stunts are superb. Personal relationships between the characters reminded me of the old I Love Lucy series. There were no sex scenes or demonic activity to disturb children. It is not a new film, but an old movie which was dubbed by Jackie Chan in his own voice and re-released. I went to see it on the big screen at full price and took my two sons and having seen it I realize I would have paid more. They are big fans of Jackie Chan. With appropriate warnings not to try this at home, they had a great time. Most movies from Hong Kong have people jumping out of trees of flying through the air and are obviously false. In this movie, people still jump and fly at the speed of gravity and it is obviously real! There is one stunt in the movie which is so hot I do not think anyone can ever forget it. It takes an ancient art and as performed by Jackie Chan it is taken to such a different level that you really would not believe me if I told you. You simply have to see it. The trailer with out takes proves this work is not easy or for the timid. Watch this movie at your own risk as all other fighting action movies will forever pale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion Drunken Master II is one of the greatest Kung Fu movies ever made. Unfortunately after it was released in the U.S. not very many people understood the genius of the film. When I got to my first period class people were talking about it saying "Oh my god, i mean like the fighting was Okay, but it was just soooo boring, like his american movies are soo much better." One person went so far as to make the comment that "Chinese people just do not know how to make movies." and "It had a really bad plot." COME ON PEOPLE! It's a Jackie Chan movie, you don't walk into a Jackie Chan movie expecting an intricate plot and multi million dollar special effects. Chan's physical humor and amazingly choreographed fight scenes are special enough without the aid of computers. Now don't get me wrong, I love great films, I would much rather watch a Fellini, Kurosawa, or Kubrick film then the latest new release, but I also have a special place in my heart for just flat out fun action movies. The barebone plot of the movie just serves as a stage for Jackie to flow through performing amazing stunt after amazing stunt. And someone made a comment about seeing a wire! Please, the fact that you saw a wire doesn't make a film bad, the incident mentioned must not have been very obvious either because I havn't noticed it in the 5 times that I've watched the movie. I havn't seen the U.S. release because of the dubbing, but I own a copy on tape and I'll be watching it regularly and I recommend that anyone who hasn't seen the movie at least give it a chance going into the movie remembering that it's a JACKIE CHAN movie.</fullReview>

Project A I &amp; II, Wheels on Meals, Armor of God, Police Story(series), Dragons Forever, and Miracles both need to grace us with an appearance on the big screen.We will not see movies like this coming from Jackie anymore because of all the laws and rules he must follow to make a film in the States. His greatest works have always, and will always, be in Hong Kong and for those of you of have yet to witness the perfection that can be achieved in fight choreography, go see this now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better with the original soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the original version of this movie DM2. The soundtrack was much better than the Dimension's remixed one. The original soundtrack can even entertains you more because the music is matched, fighting sound matched and everything was just so cool. Dimension is still very immature about re-editing. They can't make the movie exciting as it could have been. I wonder why they spent more time and money for a horible remix. All they need to do is dubbing and leave the original soundtrack alone, then that will do it much better than what you could see w/the new release. Overall this movie on the big screen was just excelent. A must see for action fans....10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEST MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE EVER MADE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge martial arts movie fan and have seen just about every jackie chan, jet li, donnie yen, yuen biao and sammo hung...ect. movie out there. This movie has the most and best fighting scenes in any movie, and its actually funny (not bordering on stupid like many of jackie's movies). It has at least 6 actors who show great martial arts abilities in this movie, as opposed to the usual one good martial arts bad guy and one good martial arts good guy. Anita Mui is reminiscent of Josephine Siao's role in Fon sai yuk 1 &amp; 2, she is great in this movie. This movie has great character development, unbelievable fighting sequences and its funny with great acting. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

From a crazy train fight, UNDERNEATH the train, to a hundred vs 2 fight in a restaurant involving chairs, swords, and falling stair cases. And the final fight is action-packed aswell as funny, as he names all the moves as he fights, like, Down the hatch, and monkey drinks master's whiskey.</fullReview>

When Fei-hong (Jackie Chan) gets plastered he becomes an unstoppable machine. Even when he's not plastered a man wielding a burning chain or an attack from about 500 Ninja can stop him, but the fight scenes where he's drunk are some of the best action sequences you'll ever see!

		<fullReview>It has to be this one. I can't believe that it took this long for them to release it here in the states. This is just a movie that everyone should see even if it's just once. It has an almost universal appeal.If you're turned off by the unpolished editing of early Jackie Chan movies, or the awful awful writing and acting (Who Am I is a nice example), you have very little to fear. The editing isn't Hollywood smooth, but it's superb where it counts. No shaking camera, no rapid series of half second takes, no blatant wirework, no cheesy digital effects.The plot is decent enough not to get in the way of the action scenes, and the action scenes get better and better building to the ~20 minute finale which you WILL want to watch again immediately ( unless you are bored by amazing displays of physical skill and would rather watch pretty explosions, shiny cars, and giant robots and dinosaurs).It's a given that there will be dubbing since many Americans are unwilling to watch a subtitled movie (even if it is one of the greatest action movies ever produced). It's a given that the dubbing will be awful since apart from a very few cartoons, there is no such thing as a good American voice actor (Am I bashing Americans enough here?). But Jackie Chan movies are not about subtleties in dialogue, and I'd like to think that sound is not necessary to enjoy the action scenes in this move.If it seems like I haven't told you anything substantial about the movie, I haven't. There's really only one thing I need to tell you... see it for yourself on a big screen. Think of everything great about a Jackie Chan movie, it's done best in Drunken Master 2(or The Legend of Drunken Master).IMDB is a place of hyperbole. Movies are all too often described in extreme terms by bored people who need an outlet for their emotions (I'm usually one of them). This movie is good. You may forget the details in time, but you will never forget the experience.</fullReview>

This was a fun little secret my friends and I discovered after I returned from a visit in China.

		<fullReview>I just finished watching Jui kuen II and if people say that Jackie Chan dose not compare to other Kung Fu stars, then they obviously have not seen this film! Jackie chan's preformence of Wong Fei-Hong is great, and the story line is not too simple, but still easy to follow (I had to watch a hardly visible subtitled version, but I could still follow most of the plot! Althogh Bruce Lee has had created some wonderful fight sequences, I can't help but stare in awe at chan's speed and stunts. The fight sequences are the best of any movie I have seen. Don't belive me? Try watching Chan fight building full of 200 guys with axes, or a guy with a flaming chain, and of course , there is the ever popular 20 min.+ final Fight sequence! This is a great movie, not just for Kung-fu lovers, but for any one who loves action movies. (hey the fact that he fights with a style that relys on getting hammered alone should make it the guy movie of the 20 AND 21 centurys!!) and it's not just men, but women who are also kicking butt and taking names. (watch the lady who plays Fei-Hong's mother, and then try and tell me that she could not kick the tar out of you! go on, I dare ya!). well I have been writing this long, even though I should not have to. But if you still don't think that it is a great movie after reading all this, then watch the movie and prove your self wrong, or smack your self in the head because your not paying attention if you can't see the aww inspireing coolness of the Drunken Master!</fullReview>

This movie has some of the best martial arts action ever caught on film, as well as a thoroughly entertaining plot. Definitely Chan's best of the 90s. As Wong Fei-Hung, Chan employs Drunken Kung Fu to dispatch his enemies, and he actually fights better when drunk.

Very few actors since Keaton have had the kind of incredible bodily control mixed with great comic timing that Chan has. Add to that the incredible charm he brings to all the roles I've seen him in and you have a very enjoyable actor to watch. The action sequences in this film are some of the best I have seen come out of Hong Kong, and the humor is somewhat more evolved then the average kung fu picture.

They are just necessary for all those excellent action scenes to be a whole.The action scenes are what jackies movies are about.And why do movies have to be about great storytelling,no I think that the way jackie makes action scenes are all about moviemaking.The only way fights can be that good and choreographed is by using different shots and edit them to a magnificent new whole.For example the end fight :jackie versus Ken Lo took months to film, but it looks like all the action is done in one take!Or take the fight in the teahouse, with that much opponents, continuity is very important. This movie showcases jackie as a genie and a superb director. Not only are these fight scenes very well made(technically), &gt; they burst of creativity. The creativity of jackie and also his stuntman crew makes every Jackie chan movie so fresh! You can't say :"well I've seen one so I've seen them all". That's why I have so much respect for jackie. And he works so hard .He made and still makes so many movies and I think therefore he's one of the greatest filmmakers ever This movie has to be seen to be believed, I can't explain how funny fast and brilliant this film is just you CHECK IT OUT!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackie Chan is a genius. I think I had seen Enter the Dragon or something before this, but once I saw Drunken Master II it not only became the milestick by which I measure other martial arts movies, but it awakened my interest in the genre in the first place.Wong Fei-Hung is a master of Drunken Boxing, which he discovered (in Drunken Master) only truly works when the fighter is actually drunk. In this movie, he accidentally takes a valuable jade seal from the British Consul; they in turn come after him. He gets drunk for a spectacular display of fighting against the Consul's hired thugs, but it angers his father and he promises to stop drinking.But there is more at stake that drinking; it is the honor of the country that is at stake.The movie is packed full of the action scenes everyone wants to see; and as amazing as even the first fight scene is, every fight is more beautiful than the one before. It's amazing that Jackie Chan can keep topping himself, but he does. See it. You won't be sorry.</fullReview>

The sheer action and choreography of the fight scenes are unparalleled (the last fight sequence between Jackie and his real-life bodyguard is absolutely PHENOMENAL! You must watch the sequence more than once to see everything!), and no mega-budget movie that Hollywood has EVER put out comes even close...If Miramax keeps true to their word and releases this magnificent film into US theaters, then they'll have nothing short of one of the (if not THE) top-grossing martial arts movie releases in American history. Period. If you haven't yet seen this spectacular display of acrobatics and martial arts, then do yourself a favor and get your hands on a copy any way you can! It can be rented at Blockbuster or bought from Suncoast (if any place else has it, I don't know about it) here in the US.Again, I VEHEMENTLY recommend this fine comedic film to anyone interested in either studying (it inspired me to take Capoeira and Wing Chun lessons!), collecting, or simply watching martial arts films. One of the best (next to Enter The Dragon w/the late great Bruce Lee, of course) films ever to grace the Planet Earth! It scores a perfect 10 in my book...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another Jackie classic, and my personal favourite. Although his earliest movies were exciting in their innovation in the field of fight choreography, this breaks new ground. Jackie, even though he is not young anymore, he still has the sleight of hand (and feet!) that are most important. I have yet to see a martial artist that is as fast as him on the silver screen without any camera tricks. (Right jet?) Jackie keeps the hits coming and without a dud in sight. We must not kid ourself about the merits of this, or any Jackie movie; it's all about bone breaking action served on a platter with good morals, filial piety, equal oppurtunity for the sexes (Hong Kong movies were the first to have a female protagonist stronger than men) and did I mention action?

		<fullReview>By the time Master Jackie had made this film, the kung fu movie genre was flagging. This movie single-handedly brought it back. So it has to be pretty good, you'd think.. and it is better than anyone can put into words. (Its title is based on a featured fighting style which involves getting smashed, after all.) I have a friend who one mustn't mention this movie around, or he'll go into a compulsive babble about how brilliant it is. :)What people don't often mention besides the action is the characters. In particular, Anita Mui does a superb job of playing Wong Fei-Hung's mischievous mother who encourages Jackie's character to fight and drink when necessary despite his father's express forbidding to do so, and the film is much better off for her contribution.Fearless Hyena? A good example of a Jackie Chan film, very funny in places, very moving in others. The Young Master? A showcase of talent, with a good dash of comedy-cum-martial-arts thrown in. But Drunken Master II? The Ultimate Jackie Chan film, bar none. See it. Now. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackie Chan portrays folk legend, Wong Fei Hung, in this story about an organization of thieves who are stealing Chinese artifacts. There isn't much to the story, but that's not a problem anyway. The fight scenes during the movie are in Traditional Chan style, lots of stunts and creative choreography. But it is the movie's final fight scene that is the reason to watch this action pic. Without a doubt, the fifteen minute fight final of Chan fighting while drunk ranks as the BEST choreographed combat sequence ever! Jackie Chan physical abilities are pushed to the extreme limit, as he performs all kinds of flips, kicks, stunts, and the precarious Drunken Boxing style.

		<shortDescription>Jackie Chan past his prime but in mint condition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Jackie Chan's homage to the film that made him a star, 1978's Drunken Master. In this epic about the Chinese folk legend Wong Fei Hung, Chan pulls out all the stops and gathers every ounce of his never-ending creativeness. Set in the turn of the century, the extremely loose plot deals with embassy workers stealing Chinese artifacts. Jackie Chan proves that he is the greatest screen fighter in the history of cinema (sorry, Bruce Lee). Since the fights and stunts are the main attractions in all Jackie Chan movies, this is no exception. The fights in this movie are more intricate, creative, and astonishing than any other Chan film to date. Chan's character has amazing combat abilities that increase ten times when Chan is drunk, hence the title. This premise gives way to an incredible scene where Chan's character must get drunk as he is battling with some thugs. The finale is a twenty minute war between Chan and his real life body guard Ken Lo. This fight scene contains the most complex choreography in any one on one fight in the history of movies. Both agile combatants flip, kick, spin, and jump around the warehouse setting trying to destroy each other. This finale leaves viewers breathless and in awe of Chan's abilities to amaze us. Any skeptics of Chan's genius who have not seen this scene must prepare to be proven wrong!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buster Keaton was maybe the greatest physical comedian ever, but Jackie Chan comes damn close. And this is the film that might be the best argument for that statement. As with all Chan films, the plot is merely an excuse for astonishingly original and over-the-top fights and comedy. Jackie was about forty when he made this film, but he could be mistaken for twenty. Which is why it isn't so unbelievable to see the much-younger Anita Mui play his stepmother and the only slightly older Ti Lung play his father. There are at least four or five extended fight sequences that are among the most energetic and entertaining I've ever seen, all relying on Chan's physical agility. Maybe even better than Chan is Mui, who nearly steals the film from Jackie. And watch for Andy Lau's brief cameo as a stranger who helps Jackie out of a jam. A wonderful comic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackie Chan's Best Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Hk movies (especialy the martial arts movies) since I can remember! I watched a lot of them even without subtitles! I just loved it! So being a fan you come across Jackie Chan! Once I had seen him in action I was hooked to all of his movies! There are not many out there I haven't seen! In every movie he has made he shows his skills trying to top the stunts he has done before! My grandmother also loved to watch him in action! Because he also could act so that you would sympathize with him! The first Drunken Master was genius,no doubt about it! But Drunken Master 2 is even better! This is the first time JC successfully combines drama,humor and great action into one movie! In the first drunken master the drunken fist style was powerful,but now in Drunken Master 2,you actually see how powerful the style really is,because now it is shown in such a way that you can feel his pounding! There are a lot of people who haven't seen a lot of Jc's (earlier) movies! Forget Rush Hour and movies he made in America after this one! If there is one Jackie Chan movie you have to see this is the one! It is his best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, Jackie's drunk but he's gonna kick your ass!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best of all Jackie Chan movies. I like the originality of its style of martial arts (especially the stance and the use of thumb and pointer finger), and sense of humor. Jackie Chan did his one of his greatest roles in action cinema as Wong Fei Hong. An easy-go-lucky character that becomes a master when his drunk! Be watchful and get ready for some action because he'll be unstoppable once he drinks booze! Fast-pacing punches and high-flying kicks will smash your face if anyone gets on his way.I really like the story because it shows the importance of obedience and discipline. Chan portrays an obedient son but a fierce fighter. One of the unbelievable stunts he made was when he crawled backwards on a bed of hot coals. Hey Jackie, are you crazy? You won't believe it guys but he did it twice feeling that he didn't have the right rhythm the first time he did it.Well, that's what he said about it. Maybe, he's drunk when he did it. I hope someday that me and Jackie can have a drink so that I may learn his remarkable and unique style of fighting. The power behind alcohol. Let's drink to that Jackie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this is a good movie, but it definitely lacks in some areas. Parts of the story fell down for me. Yet, Jackie Chan is brilliant with his Drunken Boxing.Everything about the making of this movie is better... Better filming, better prints, better cinematography, and better skill in the martial arts. Even the base story was good. It just had holes you could drive a truck through, and I felt somewhat empty watching the final scene.Also, while Jackie is definitely improved his fighting skills, he doesn't use the Drunken style as fully as in the first, and that hurts to a bit as well.It's not a bad movie, it just doesn't live up to the first, but few sequals do. Anyone who watched this and liked it should go get the original Drunken Master. You will be thankful you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Kung Fu movie, but different than Bruce Lee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Kung Fu movie _is_ one of Jackie's best, if not _the_ best. It's quite fun and the fights are crisp. The moves are well filmed and most seem plausible and Jackie's fight choreography is the best in the business. I really wish Bruce Lee were around to match films. Bruce's films were more serious and death abounded. In Jackie's films, it's rare for people to die. But then, that's his element. They tend to be fun movies that move along at a brisk pace. Where they move to is anyone's question, but the ride is enjoyable. 8 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About 100 minutes long. Originally released as "Drunken Master 2", But called " The Legend of Drunken Master". This has Jackie as a man who lives with his parents in China that practices Drunken Boxing(a form of martial Arts). He finds out that agents are stealing ancient Chinese artifacts and jewlery. Jackie's best performance is in the final half hour.Rated R: Martial Arts Violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good Jackie Chan flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good martial arts film involving Chan as a man who likes to "drunk" box his opponents--that means he's dead roaring drunk when he does it which makes him better. I know--it makes no sense, but how many Chan pictures are realistic? Also, Chan is way too old to be playing a guy who's supposed to be in his 20s or 30s. All that aside, it's a very entertaining film. Lapses in the script and characterization are all forgiven with the fights. There are many, they are nonstop with some amazing moves and they're fun! A lot of them were filmed in fast motion making them seem even quicker and faster. Also, the part where Chan imitates Bruce Lee is hilarious! Worth seeing--just ignore the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Legend of Drunken Master" tops my list as Jackie Chan's best movie to date.What Bruce Lee did for his fans in "Enter the Dragon",Jackie Chan does the same for his fans in this one.Packed with the most astounding martial arts scenes ever captured on screen,"The Legend of Drunken Master" tells the story of a chinese folk hero who has his own style of fighting called drunken boxing.Of course he isn't powerful enough if he doesn't have any whine in his system.That doesn't mean he can't kick butt when he's sober.Jackie Chan provides plenty of kung fu excitement for the biggest martial arts fan."The Legend of Drunken Master" is the kind of movie that I hail as a Jackie Chan classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm glad to see some real fighting styles returning to the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I'm not usually a fan of Jackie Chan movies, I think he makes movies that are entertaining to a certain extent, but get old fast. Why is this? Because he generally does Chinese drama instead of actual fighting styles. This makes his movies look good, but also unsatisfying to hardcore martial arts fans like myself. Using such dramatic fighting tends to take away from any realism the film might have. Now, while Legend of the Drunken Master may have some outrageous situations, at least the fighting is very similar to what you would see if you watched real masters of their particular styles fight.I, personally think that Drunken style Kung Foo is great. If done correctly it's extremely effective and equally entertaining to watch. Perfect for a good martial arts movie. I was happy to find that Drunken Boxing isn't the only real style used in the film, most of the people use real and very recognizable styles as well. One worth mentioning is the fight with the head bad guy at the end, he shows off his fantastic talent in Kickboxing, with a very elaborate fight sequence.As with most martial arts films, the story and philosophy (if any) falls short, although I can't really say I've seen a film get it right since Enter the Dragon. This can't be completely blamed on the film since I'm sure a lot was lost in the translation, kind of makes me want to learn Chinese. But I didn't expect much from it, I just wanted some great fight scenes and that's exactly what I got.I gave Legend of the Drunken Master 7 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much great fighting, I started to get bored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far, Jackie Chan has been entertaining when paired with Americans. As the lone star, he just doesn't do it for me. Rumble in the Bronx entertained me, but not like Rush Hour or High Noon.This is a comedy of errors with so much deception among the "good guys" I am not sure who really are the bad guys. At least I know what they want and they go about getting it. Every other line among the "good guys" is a lie and the master ends up looking like a joke.The movie is about the fight scenes, which at times are endless. One thing about Steven Seagal when he hits someone they go down - a lot like real life. These are cartoon characters and this is cartoon violence. Some of the scenes were impressive and some were boring. I also thought I saw one of the ropes pulling Chan back at one point. It is so obvious they were being used, maybe my mind made them up.So, if you like endless fight scenes with a few laughs, enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was finally released in the states and unfortunately in dubbed format so I wasn't expecting too much. However, I'm happy to report, the dub job was not that bad, and actually added to the entertainment of the film. Speaking of the film, which is very Action Packed, features now Americanized Jackie Chan in one of his better older Hong Kong films. There are plenty of great choreographed fight sequences involving the nontraditional fighting styles known as Drunken Boxing (get drunk and fight better). Some scenes are so breathtaking and creative, its hard to conceive how it was performed. Chan does an excellent job as well as all around supporting cast including Chan's Mother played by Anita Mui. This film is without a doubt a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do I describe Drunken Master II? In one word, as Will Smith would say - DAMN!@! This is absolutly amazing. It maybe not be as good as the original, which is one of the best martial arts films ever made along with Enter the Dragon, it's still amazing. And seeing this film gives you so much respect for Jackie, he's unbelieveable in this. Everyone raves about the final fight, but that's not all to rave about. Every fight in the movie is astounding. He's just so fast and furious that it's so fun to watch. I have one complaint though, besides the subtitles being hard to read because that's just obvious. When is the US gonna get movies like this? This is 10x better than Twin Dragons. It's annoying to have to order this all the way from Hong Kong to get my hands on it. But overall, I checked back at amazon.com on a weekly basis to see if they had any copies. It took me 5 months of waiting and it finally came in. And now I regret it, because if I knew it was gonna be that good I woulda checked daily. 10/10 perfect</fullReview>

Chan delivers the customary goods in this genre crowd pleaser as the eponymous martial artist who faces a formidable foe in the form of an evil industrial factory owner enslaving his people with the only deterrent being a showdown of some serious ass-kicking chop-socky fury fueled by his high alcoholic intake (think Popeye fortified with spinach). Chan, in one of his best films here, displays his signature breakneck slapstick with precision-timed highly calibrated fight choreography that will leave you slack jawed in awesome wonder of 'How does he do it??' Re-release from 1994 The final fight sequence is one for the film vault. (Dir: Lau Ka Leung)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly weak and confused sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Drunken Master 2' aka 'The Legend of Drunken Master' is quite a major disappointment for this fan of the original. The very belated sequel to Jackie Chan's wonderfully entertaining breakthrough film sees him still playing a teenager well into his forties, but jettisons most of what made the original such fun - such as Yuen Wu Ping's imaginative and often hilarious martial arts choreography and even the character of the Drunken Master himself - in favour of the old mixed suitcases plot and tedious generation gap comedy.It was a troubled production, with Chan falling out with original director and co-star Chia-Liang Liu and finishing the film himself, and the end result looks decidedly undecided: there's very little of the comic drunken boxing (and what there is is terrible) while co-star Andy Lau is given a mysterious build-up in the first reel only to disappear from the rest of the film. The final fight is quite good, but this is well below what Chan is capable of.As usual with the US releases, the US DVD is a Miramaxed version: the cuts are extremely minor (the only noticeable omission is the offensive final gag), but it has been quite horribly dubbed. Sadly, the Asian DVD releases are all in the wrong ratio - 1.85:1 - while this version is at least presented in 2.35:1.</fullReview>

This is the first 0 I've ever given to a movie but it is equitable for it. This movie had no plot, no story line, no effects, no good music, no good actors, and most of all no direction. The fighting scenes in this movie were awful and made no sense. This and all of Jackie Chans movies are just an excuse to show of his martial art gift but this movie can't even do that. In this movie people fought for no reason and nothing was solved. The only thing proved in this movie is that Jackie Chan can't act and he never could. You knew as much leaving the theatre as you did as you were going in. The plot was basically that Jackie Chan could not be killed while he was drunk. I really don't recommend this film to anyone, sorry Jackie. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's just what you would expect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have seen any of Chan's movies before, you already know what to expect. The mainstays are well represented, excellent fighting scenes, a very frail plot and, the best part of many of his movies, the stunt screw ups as the credits roll. I just viewed this movie and I can't remember any of the character's names. I can barely remember why he was fighting anyone. But all that doesn't matter, just as long as he's bouncing, throwing, spinning and juggling everything on screen at once during the wild fight scenes. This is an uncomplicated movie that gets to the root of his abilities on screen quickly, but then troubles itself to introduce some character development mini plots, compleat with the "I no longer have a son!" line. But it would be a shame to let the childish (even stupid) dialogue and characters take away from the imaginative, humorous and complex action of this film. So just sit tight and wait through the "plot" progression scenes for the real goodies. With absolutely nothing to back up the fight scenes in this movie, I cannot, with good conscious, advise a non-Jackie Chan fan to see this movie. I rate it a three out of ten. But if you are like me and have to see all of his movies, then this is a special one. It is part two of one of his first big time commercial hits in China way back when. So go get it and watch for the fantastic final fight when Jackie takes out the big boss! Whatever his name was...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE LEGEND OF DRUNKEN MASTER / (2000) Zero StarsBy Blake French:  There are two types of people on the planet, fans of Jackie Chan and people who despise him and his ilk. Obviously I fall under the later category; is any kind of Hollywood torture greater than the painful experiences of watching a Jackie Chan film? The fact that "The Legend of Drunken Master" was filmed in 1994 but not given a wide North American released until now should be a clue of the quality of this production. And how the highlights of his movies are not during the actual movie, but at the closing outtakes where audiences get to see Chan really get injured, burned, dropped, slammed, hit, or breaking a bone-any coincidence why those sequences are many people's favorite? I don't think so.  The action sequences in Jackie Chan's "The Legend of Drunken Master" are amazing. There is no doubt that there is some simply amazing physical coordination and precise choreography involved. The film involves some of the most intricate, difficult and energetically executed action sequences ever photographed. Unfortunately, after viewing about a dozen other bad Jackie Chan films, the fact that he does most of his own stunts no longer shocks us, and instead provides a reasonable excuse to rationalize pointless violence. We may have been astounded the first several times we saw Chan himself scampering up high walls, jumping into a moving train's windows, and using every day utensils as brutal weapons against his enemy, but now such actions are expected and contrived. There is only so much harm one man can do to another man and continue to keep an audience intrigued; Chan passed most individual's limit years ago. What ticks me off most about Jackie Chan films is how there is never any actual plot. I recently screened an action thriller starring Arnold Schwarzenegger called "The 6th Day." That film interwove high-tech intense action sequences into its fascinating story line, while "The Legend of Drunken Master" only provides a clothesline in which a bunch of pointless action scenes can evolve. As always, the characters are meaningless and thin, the dialogue, dubbed in English, is irrelevant to the story and ranges from insipid to preposterous, and the action scenes themselves come at a dime a dozen. The plot in this film details a young martial artist named Wong Fei-Hung (Jackie Chan) who uses a complex technique to battle enemies that only can be achieved when he is drunk out of his mind. He must get a stolen artifact from a team of artful villains. Sounds a little sparse? Try spreading that plot out over a running time of over one hundred minutes."The Legend of Drunken Master" made an inevitable appearance on my list of the worst films of the year. I received an e-mail questioning the category in which I placed this motion picture into, "Action with no point." "Hence when Jackie Chan movies have a point?" asks an inquisitive reader. This is troublesome, of how people have grown to except movies without a plot as long as they have a lot of zany action. "The Legend of Drunken Master" has no plot, or point, or message, or spirit, no impact, or anything else for that matter. But it is amazing of how many critics and audiences loved it. If the absence of story is no regard to so many viewers, what will be next? The absence of characters? Or how about the absence of moving picture on screen? </fullReview>
