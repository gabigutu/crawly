		<shortDescription>incredible movie: go and see it!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. Loved the actors, the story, the setting, the music: all of it. I am European and really appreciated that kind of tone in the movie. I thought about it for a few days afterward. Joe Mantegna is fantastic in his role as Charlie. Max Minghella and Blake Lively are phenomenal as Elvis and Anabelle: the chemistry between them is great. Mary Steenburghen is amazing in anything she does. Keith Corradine is wonderful as well. I love the message of hope that gives to teens. It is refreshing after seeing all these horror/slasher movies out in theaters. I would definitely recommend this movie and in fact I am already doing so: when is it going to come out?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly memorable film!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Elvis and Annabelle does a superb job of capturing and dealing with the inner struggles of both characters. The natural chemistry between Max and Blake makes them perfect for the lead roles. Joe Montegna also delivered in his role and touches your heart. He is genuine and in-character throughout the entire film.I also liked how the film naturally transitioned from a darker, black &amp; white feel to a brighter and more colorful feel when Annabelle arrived at the house/mortuary.Most independent movies have been filmed on very tight budgets and therefore have numerous flaws that are evident on the screen. Elvis and Annabelle also was filmed on a tight budget, but the director did an amazing job of bringing the entire film together in a way that truly minimizes the flaws. What an accomplishment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely touching and beautiful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is absolutely exquisite in its presentation of a beautiful story. The characters are interesting and thoughtful, yet wonderfully mysterious. Max Minghella and Blake Lively have an incredible magnetic chemistry that keeps the audience engaged throughout the film. Max Minghella will definitely appeal to the younger female audience because his character, Elvis, is dark and mysterious, yet incredibly vulnerable and sensitive. Not to mention he is absolutely heaven to look at! The film also features amazing performances from seasoned actors such as Joe Mantegna and Mary Steenburgen. Finally, this film is unique in that it appeals to a variety of audiences. My teenage daughter fell in love with Max Minghella and his portrayal of Elvis, my mother was captured by the humorous and touching performance of Joe Mantegna, and my husband and I were pleased by the refreshing absence of violence. I would definitely recommend this film, and look forward to its future release. I hope it is soon!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Elvis and Annabelle at a screening in Los Angeles. I was captured by the uniquely beautiful and gritty Texas locations. The acting was terrific. Blake Lively really captured the innocence of first love and Max Minghella's performance had a brooding James Dean quality. A dreamlike atmosphere underlines this film, beautiful and disturbing, portraying love's many shades of dark and light. The writer-director has a very compelling story telling ability. One particularly poignant moment was when the red umbrella of the deceased father went drifting slowly across the field blown by the wind. The film was filled with many such moments. I recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie made my wife cry (several times) and I thought about it (the movie) for several days afterward. We enjoyed it very much. So did everyone else at the showing (which was sold out). The film has an engaging story, happy ending, beautiful photography, great title, interesting setting (a mortuary without being gross)) and good actors. But it was also "different". The story in particular was thoughtful and well-written and, on its own, kept everyone engaged as the protagonists went from misguided misery to ignorant bliss to suspenseful drama, to . . . . I particularly liked Anabelle (beautiful and seemingly transparent acting), the mortician's father (deceptively sly in a positive fashion) and some of the "spare" dialog (which is hard to write). The mortician's devotion to his father was also touching. All in all, I strongly recommend the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected - funny and romantic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie should have had a wider release and more publicity. It's really enjoyable. It's got the story of a good indie movie like "Sideways" or "Little Miss Sunshine" - it's funny, touching, original and actually quite romantic. It's part dark comedy, part quirky romance. The situations are not unpleasant and the dialog is well written. The actors are good. Blake Lively is a lovely beauty pageant contestant Anabelle and acts very well - probably one of the best acting jobs she has done out of Gossip Girl. She is a perfect fit for the role. Max Minghella as the embalmer Elvis while not a heartthrob is quite suited to this offbeat hero. They have chemistry a bit like Penn Badgley &amp; Blake do in Gossip Girl. Mary Steenburgen is just right as the anxious pageant mom. Keith Carradine is good as the stepfather. Joe Mantegna is quite moving as Elvis's father. Very highly recommended. Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tour de force of independent film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Appearing recently at the Mill Valley Film Festival, this jewel of a film combines deft humor, potent romantic chemistry and a subtle touch of the macabre in one of the most compelling love stories to appear on film in a long while. The script is wonderfully fresh, the cinematography stunning but never self-conscious, and the cast could not possibly be improved. Max Minghella is an extraordinary young talent--reminiscent of a young Johnny Depp--and Blake Lively is lovely and authentic as a small-town Texan beauty. Joe Mantegna does a phenomenal turn as an aging and disabled mortician, bringing dignity and wry humor to a challenging role. Kudos to writer-director Will Geiger for this beautiful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the storyline, I expected the movie to be a little cheesy, but I was blown away by how good it was. I really enjoyed the plot development (trying not to spoil anything), I never once looked at my watch to estimate how much time was left. I was sucked into the story and forgot I was watching a movie. To me that is what makes a good film. Something that allows you to suspend belief, like a great book. I highly recommend it. It is sweet, but not a chic flick. I plan to add it to my collection. If movies had opposable thumbs, I would give it a high five. I was pleasantly surprised by Blake Lively, as I missed the Traveling Pants show. Max Minghella stole my heart. Joe Mantegna was fantastic as always. I am interested to see what else Will Geiger has done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The people who gave this movie one star may have seen another movie.I loved it even though I hate Blake Lively to death (see Gossip Girl) because she can't even act and has an annoying voice. But in this movie she was actually decent, not great but bearable. Max Minghella is awesome as always(one of my favourite young actors) and he kinda saves the whole movie acting-wise (along with Joe Mantegna who shines as the alienated father). The plot was great and original, the directing was good but what really makes this a 10 out of 10 is the overall feeling I got. I was left with a smile on my face even though this is essentially a drama. It makes you think about things and offers a pretty optimistic view on life. Like looking on the bright side. It stuck with me and made me go and recommend it to my friends. Repeatedly. Miracles exist and this is a gem of a movie. Period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A very sweet movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I picked this movie out after seeing Max Minghella in Alejandro Amenabar's Agora. I wondered: who is this wonderful actor and why I don't know him? I liked this movie a lot, maybe because I didn't know what to expect... The storyline, the characters and the setting was exactly right. I really liked Mary Steenburg in this film, although I see her all the time in many productions, and she had a smaller part, I am going to remember her in this one. And a loud applause for Joe Mantegna, I first didn't recognize him but when I did, I was completely stunned that it was him. I hope to see Blake Lively (specially) and Max Mingella in drama genre because it suits them and they did absolutely fantastic work. 10 out of 10 for me, thanks to the right kind of ending :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of a modern fairytale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It isn't perfect but it's beautiful! It's how they say in the trailer, the two are complete opposites but miracles brought them together and we learn it's because they really must be together... It has the father and son relation too and it's so beautiful... Elvis is the kind of really good guy that doesn't believe anything good may happen to him, until he feels the pain of be free of all his duties and is compelled to fight back. While Anabelle really wishes something good might happen to her, and even if she doesn't feel like she can fight it all, she starts to run for it when she wakes up... It's a really pretty modern "what might have happened after Sleeping Beauty wakened up" story if you pay attention in the feelings that they tried to show... And the soundtrack matches it too! ;-) [ I wanted to cry several times while watching this film. ]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, dark, touching, hopeful. A soul-treat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes a certain type of personality to enjoy this movie as much as I did. Melancholic yet hopeful, with a mystical yet romantic flair, this movie can really touch your heart especially if you're open and in the mood for your heart to be touched.I recently watched Max Minghella in The Social Network and was slightly turned off by the person he portrays but his role in Elvis &amp; Anabelle gave me a totally different (positive) vibe. Some people might find him dark and unappealing but once knowing the goodness of his intentions and the kindness of his heart it's impossible not to like him.A whole separate review can be written about Blake Lively who is quite annoying in Gossip Girl but somehow likable at the same time and just one of those actors who you can't take your eyes off of. In fact I found Elvis &amp; Anabelle while I was looking for more titles with Lively in them.The performance of Joe Mantegna and his relationship to the other main characters in this movie are sweet and endearing. Actually I think a lot of the amazing feeling I got by the end of the movie was due to his role in it.Overall - watch it if you haven't watched it, have no great expectations, and you might be pleasantly surprised and find yourself thinking about it for days afterwords.It's one of those movies about the small things in life that give you the most meaning. It's one of those movies that make you want to live the simple life of the main characters and make you believe you will be completely satisfied with it. Worth mentioning is also the great cinematography - many beautiful scenes like fine art photographs taken by a talented photographer.Other titles that left me with a similar hopeful and warm feeling: Waitress, The Good Girl, The Family Stone, Little Miss Sunshine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming and offbeat. Minghella is enchanting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that is so good because it is so different. I can't really think of another film that one could confuse with this one. It's unique! Let's see -- a young undertaker apprentice (so to speak), whose father is not well enough to carry on the family business, gets ready to embalm a beauty queen contestant who had a fatal heart attack...kisses her (shades of necrophilia), and she turns out not to be dead after all. They fall in love...bumpy in places...until she remembers the necrophiliac kiss...but ultimately get back together after he is disgraced in the press.The one special ingredient here is young Max Minghella, an actor who is about as charismatic as you can get! Some compare him to a young Johnny Depp, but that is more based on looks...Minghella is far more talented (whether he will become as successful as Depp is another question).Blake Lively is very good in her role, though she doesn't seem quite beautiful enough to be in a beauty contest...although the film takes place in Texas, so who knows, maybe that's as pretty as they get in Texas. Joe Mantegna is just charming in his role as Minghella's deformed father...one of his most endearing roles. Mary Steenburgen does well as the doting mother of the beauty contestant...but is just obnoxious enough that you won't like her character. Keith Carradine does well as the creepy stepfather...although it's unclear if there is something there that is almost incestuous, though it's certainly implied.The movie is quirky, but I mean that in a good way! I couldn't take my eyes of the screen. Highly recommended, though I doubt you'll want it on your DVD shelf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not normally a fan of Blake Lively but even I have to agree that she did well in this movie. Minghella was captivating and this movie would be lost without him. Charlie can only be described as Anabelle put it, "Precious" and was just one more reason to completely love this movie. This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time. From start to finish it is fantastic. Lively and Minghella have great chemistry together. There is not one single thing that I dislike about it. I love the mortician setting and the fact that this movie is unlike any other that you will ever see. I definitely recommend it to anyone. I wish I could give it more stars because I definitely would. It deserves the 10 and more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky, fun, delightful movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't heard anything about this movie and so didn't have a clue what it was going to be about. After the first 10 minutes, I assumed it was going to be a creepy, bizarre horror movie. To my delight, it turned out to be a fun, romantic, touching and lovely adventure, with interesting, quirky characters. A beauty queen with an overly ambitious Mother, suddenly dies and then comes back to life to have the chance to escape the clutches of her Mother's vicarious dreams and have an adventure of her own. While hiding out with the undertaker family that was present when the spark of life returned to her, she has a romantic interlude with the son of mortician. His bizarre kiss while she was seemingly still deceased is the catalyst that almost seems to bring her back to life, but becomes the incident that eventually returns her to her family and away from him ad the media defines him as a necrophiliac. The plot scenario is an unlikely one, but a little bit of suspending reality can result in a thoroughly enjoyable and fun bit of sweet and touching entertainment. This movie has humor, likable characters, an interesting plot, sentimentality, and a bit of sadness. I totally recommend this one; it will make you laugh, make you cry, and touch your heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie made me so happy and so sad in so many ways. Blake Lively shines along with the rest of the cast. I have never felt so emotional towards a movie since The Notebook. Actually, I would probably consider this movie a darker version of the Notebook. It was sweet and made you really think of whats important and who's important in life. I rate this 10 out of 10 on so many reasons its hard to narrow it down. The acting is amazing. The directing is amazing and the music is so perfect for this movie. All these elements made this movie truly outstanding. It amazes me that it took me so long to actually see this movie and that it hasn't gotten the praise it deserves. Outstanding piece of romantic drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poorly written borefest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How does stuff like this get greenlit? Amazingly poorly written and directed, it has a couple big name actors in small roles. What were they thinking? This movie is terrible and the two leads are just awful. There is no chemistry and they're poorly cast. But having to read those terrible lines doesn't help one bit.Worst of all is the 23 "reviews" I'm seeing here clearly written by the same person (the director I'm assuming). Every single one is written EXACTLY THE SAME!!!: "I saw this at (film festival here). The chemistry was amazing. (Director's name) did so much with a low budget. My mother liked (character) and my boyfriend liked (character). Keep an eye on (director). What an amazing film" At least TRY and disguise your reviews - don't simply write the same review over and over and over. No other film in the history of the IMDb had so many "people" see it at a film festival, sign up to the IMDb to leave a review like this film. Check out the 23 reviews. NO other reviews, only this movie. And what's more insulting is the guy gives himself a TEN in every "review." It's ridiculous. Why isn't someone looking into this?I've said it before, I'll say it again, people should not be allowed to comment on their own movies in here. You'd think this was Citizen Kane by the way the guy writes the reviews about his own movie. Let's just call it the Anti-Citizen Kane.AVOID!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elvis and Anabelle doesn't so much defy categorization, as it confronts and taunts it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Elvis and Anabelle is a marvelous modern-day fable that took the rules, crossed them out, wrote them over, crumpled them up, burned them and dumped the ashes at sea.It focuses on a couple of small town, fresh-out-of-high-school kids stuck in rolls the never wanted (beauty queen and morticians apprentice,) who are both playing along out of a sense of commitment, that is, until she dies, and they meet.While it has the elements of a Cinderella story, a beautiful princess, and a reluctantly charming prince, there are points in the film where it jerks you into modern-day reality, and uses that reality to confront and question the fantasy. It asks the viewer to question the price the characters pay for the fairy tale rolls they play, in a wonderful way.Joe Mantegna is an absolute revelation, in the roll of Elvis's handicapped father. He plays it so perfectly, and sweetly, that I found myself loving him before I realized who it was. He slips into the roll so well that he seems to physically change, without ever overplaying the disadvantages.While this is a sweet and engaging film for all ages, if you have high-school age kids in particular, bring this one home for movie night. It's hip enough to engage them long enough to hook them.If you liked:The Princess Bride The Perks Of Being A Wallflower StandBy Me The Age of Adaline you'll probably like Elvis and Anabelle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not So Great Expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beginning with its outrageous premise, anticipated this film could only disappoint. In every critical scene there was opportunity for it to go wrong. I expected it to turn silly, then it didn't. When I knew it would be too melodramatic or corny it didn't go there either.In particular I am critical of how the south is depicted in film. Accents are typically exaggerated with unrealistic dialog. Law enforcement is usually portrayed as incompetent and fumbling. "Elvis and Anabelle" comes close to violating all of the clichés yet never crosses the line.Finally I realized my cynical prejudgment was similar to Elvis's life disposition. What I didn't expect was this movie to inspire me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a delight to watch. I knew nothing before watching it, except for the tiny description on TV. Being a native Texan, I am often disappointed in actor's accents when they are portraying a Texan or someone from a nearby southern state. I was not disappointed in the accents in this movie, which made it more endearing. The daddy, played by Joe Mantegna was wonderful. He reminded me SO MUCH of a sweet southern man we knew a few years back. We do love our quirky types here. Blake Lively was sweet and didn't overplay. I never watched Gossip girl, and have only seen a few things with her in it, but she was really believable. Max Minghella had a believable stance/walk and just wonderful.I hope you watch the movie and appreciate it. It is sad, happy, endearing and was way more of a film than I had expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bizarre... but cute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never heard of this movie, I guess it didn't make it into mainstream distribution. I just caught it on a movie channel today, by accident.Little Miss Sunshine was quirky and offbeat, but in a way that doesn't seem too outrageous. I think it's harder to warm to a movie about the everyday tale of a mortician, the bulimic beauty queen, and the mortician's disabled father. It's probably just me, but I was distracted by the disabled father, thinking: I hope Joe Mantegna's taken the advice of Robert Downey Jr in Tropic Thunder, "never go full retard".Plus the bulimic beauty queen dies, the disabled father dies, the mortician's mother committed suicide a few years back, and both the mortician and the bulimic beauty queen entertain thoughts of suicide, and are shown about to act on them. There's really way too much death, and near-death, for this to make it as a mainstream movie.That said, it is touching how the mortician wakes the bulimic beauty queen with a kiss. And then, having had a near-death experience, she re-evaluates her life, and hides away with the mortician and his dad. Where, of course, love blossoms despite the complications of a mortician who kisses corpses. And the mortician realizes that even if your mom commits suicide, and your disabled dad drops dead playing golf... if you have a field of sunflowers, and get to sleep with Blake Lively, then things can't be too bad.But Lively and Minghela were cute together, and they made it a pretty entertaining and touching story. And Mantegna was good, as always, as the father, and he also had some sweet scenes with his son. Overall, better than it sounds, and better than it deserved to be. Rather than quirky, it was more bizarre and morbid... but in a good way. I enjoyed it, and I think it's good enough that it deserves a wider audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable small movie with a European Sensibility</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure how I heard of this movie, but I just recently saw it on DVD. Despite a very unfortunate title, that probably discouraged potential viewers, this was a very well done small film. The film kept my interest throughout, in spite of a very slender plot. A pre-'Gossip Girl' Blake Lively is radiant and likable in this film. It's too bad they couldn't find more for Mary Steenburgen and Keith Carradine to do in the film, but an almost unrecognizable Joe Mantegna is a true delight as he steals every scene he is in. The cinematography was a real standout. Great care obviously went into the framing of the shots, as they manage to wring every ounce of beauty out of the sparse central Texas landscape, and barren South Padre Island seashore. About three quarters of the way through, I realized that this movie had a very definite European feel to it. It is vaguely reminiscent of an Eric Rohmer film, one of his slight tales of love, morality and obsession. If I have one fault with the movie, it is that I wanted to know more about the characters of Elvis and Anabelle. How did they become the people they are.I have to assume that the 1 star ratings given by a couple of reviewers must be from fans of Michael Bay films. Obviously there are no explosions, mindless chase scenes , cartoon-ish special effects, or cartoon characters in this film. So, if that is your preferred entertainment, I respectfully suggest that you skip this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving story of love conquering loss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is not much wrong with this film. It is very moving. I was touched to my core, weeping deeply, several times. For the most part the acting is spot on, and the plot is different. The cinematography is stunning; the location serene, if a tad morbid. Elvis is a very deep, if troubled young man, of considerable talent. He works as a mortician at the family's funeral parlour, tending to his ailing father in the wake of his mother's suicide a decade earlier. Elvis' love for his father is the most touching you are likely to witness. He reads to him every night before bed. Elvis' father quite rightly worships the ground his son walks on. The plot revolves around a beauty queen Annabelle who is taken to their funeral parlour and the subsequent turn of events.The simplicity yet authenticity of Elvis' life tantalises Annabelle whose background is all style over substance. In her parents, her shallow, attention-seeking, competitive mother vies with the perversion of her creepy, bourbon-swilling stepfather for who is the more repugnant. Annabelle coaxes Elvis on a journey of discovery, love and ultimately, hope. The plot takes a few turns and the ending is unexpected.What makes this film for me is the depth and compassion of the three main characters. Joe Mantegna is superlative as Charlie, as is the riveting Max Minghella (God bless his father). Blake Lively also convinces. I was surprised, enthralled, thrilled, captivated, deeply moved; I wanted to stay. You will too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elvis and Anabell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being such a low-budget film I wasn't expecting much from Elvis and Anabelle but I'm glad I was proved wrong. Both Blake Lively and Max Minghella's performances were excellent. They portrayed characters who both hid dark secrets but also kept the believability of each character at an all time high. Joe Montegna stole the show for me playing the physically and mentally challenged father of Elvis( Max Minghella). His witty one-liners and the love he showed for Elvis and Anabell will touch your heart in such away that you will think about this movie for a long time after the credits role. With such a quirky storyline and characters you will surely fall in love with,Elvis and Anabell is a terrific must-see film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>absolutely wonderful movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i absolutely loved this movie. there was a little bit of everything in it. basically a pageant queen named Anabelle played by Blake Lively suddenly has a heart attack after winning a pageant because of her bulimia. she dies and her body is sent to a mortuary that is supposed to be run by a man named Charlie played by Joe Mantegna. he's too sick to run it, so his son Elvis does under the table because he doesn't have his mortuary license. while Ananbelle is on the table, he feels bad for her so before he takes her picture he kisses her, and the camera accidentally goes off and captures it. he goes to turn it off and she wakes up. Elvis runs to tell his dad and also tells him to say he was the one that was there because Elvis isn't supposed to be practicing. You can pretty much figure out where it goes from there, she ends up going home but keeps dreaming of that night and wants to know what happened. she runs away and stays there for a while until her mother sends the police out looking for her. if you want to her the rest, go watch it, its amazing. i fell in love with Max Minghella's character Elvis, he reminded me a little bit of Noah in "The Notebook". Anabelle and Elvis had amazing chemistry in this movie. i thought the plot of was great and the characters had so much depth. there wasn't a dull moment. Elvis' dad Charlie was by far my favorite character. he did such a wonderful job in this role. i love this movie, i don't know why it isn't more popular, i highly recommend it. i give it a 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the movie at the Newport Beach Film Festival and was surprisingly pleased. I had no idea that a romance based in a mortuary could be so enjoyable. In a day of remakes and dull story lines, it was a pleasure to see a fresh and intriguing plot line. Strong performances by Max Minghella, Blake Lively and especially Joe Mantegna kept the audience captivated until the end. Mantegna's performance as a physically and mentally challenged father is magnificent. The cinematography is outstanding and immerses you in each scene. The soundtrack is as obscure as the story line but is also a breath of fresh air when compared to the usual Top 40 used in most movies. This is a must see movie. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely to watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film at the Newport Beach Film Festival. I don't often write commentary.. I figure there are plenty of other folks to do it, but I felt this film deserved some recognition. Even if it is just from me! It is beautifully shot in Texas. The characters are whole and interesting. It will have you laughing and tearing up within moments. The actors all seemed to have great chemistry. This is a quirky film and not just a love story by any means. We had four grossly different personalities in our group when we went to see it. Every one of us enjoyed the film for one reason or another. If I were being overly critical, the one thing that seemed a little "off" was the musical background. I took notice of it several times and, in my opinion, you should be focused on the film and the music is just a back drop. I still enjoyed it very much! See it if you get the chance!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe I have never seen this movie anywhere! It was extremely touching and interesting, I felt afterward like I did after seeing the film Life as a House...it's just such a nice story and you feel so connected to the characters. Why don't movies like this end up in the theater? Instead we get stuck with multi-million dollar garbage like Land of the Lost. Like the commenter before me, there was no violence...but it was still very entertaining. I hope at some point to be able to purchase this movie and share it with others. I love Blake and the guy that played Elvis was great too. I didn't have that embarrassed feeling I sometimes get when the movie is really corny-it was very well played. At any rate, if you have an opportunity to see this movie, do. It was excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>April 2008: WINS: Audience Choice at Sonoma Valley Film Festival</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was shown twice at the SVFF (April 2008) - to a sold out house both times. Everyone seemed to really enjoy it. It won the audience choice award for best narrative feature and one of the jury awards. There is great writing, great acting, and cinematography. It is thought provoking and yet very enjoyable, just wonderful. Listening to Will explain his thoughts and motivations for writing this was extremely interesting. If you get a chance to see it - do it! A great and already notable cast. Max may be the next Kevin Spacey (you will never know he is British...) Also, the cameos of the child Anabelle and the child Elvis are Will's own children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why We Go to Film Festivals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the best film at the Sonoma Film Festival in 2008. We have waited for a release for this film since, and, to our amazement and disappointment, this gem has not been picked up, so far. While I am glad to have seen it when it was available and grateful that I may have been among the few will get a chance to see it, it is sad that such a fine movie will expire without a chance to please American audiences.The acting is excellent. The lead played by Max Minghella, reminds us of Johnny Depp. Depp, one of the finest American actors, did parts like this in Gilbert Grape and Ed Wood. Elvis is a quirky, misfit who is irresistible. His unlikely love interest is the extremely beautiful and very normal Annabelle, played by Blake Lively. This is Ms. Lively's finest performance as a young actress. Joe Montegna disappears into his supporting role. As often as you have seen him, you will find him hard to locate. He is excellent as the disabled father.This is a sweet, beautiful little film that stands for the proposition that geniuses and artists make fine movies, but soulless idiots in the executive suites decide what the public will see. No wonder corporate America needs a bailout. Our companies are run by pinheads who have neither brains nor hearts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary and Captivating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this at the Newport Beach Film Festival. This is a film that deserves wide spread distribution. Bring your children, your parents, your friends, and even your enemies. What a moving, poignant story. It is a love story beyond simple romance, and more about the love of life itself. The father/son relationship is extraordinary and precious. It is an especially insightful journey into the transformation of the human psyche out of pain into joy while seeking and avoiding that deep connection we all fear and long for. Beautifully written, powerfully directed, and visually stunning. The cast performs to perfection. Every detail is imbued with intelligence, heart and care. Elvis and Annabelle is truly unique in a world fraught with redundancy. Be prepared to embrace the miraculous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad. Really Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stumbled across this page and saw the glowing reviews. All tens. So I had my wife get this movie.We sat there wondering how anyone could give this movie a ten. It was hard to watch. Some over the top performances. Some bad acting. Atrocious writing. Yeah, there was some bad dialog. Mind numbing bad. She couldn't even watch anymore. I told her one review said she'd cry. She wanted to cry from boredom.I wondered how in the heck THIS movie got so many good reviews. So I went back and looked at them. Guess what? All written by the same guy. I should have known. Every single review here is the exact same review. I don't know how I missed it. I've seen other movies here where the director went in and wrote a couple reviews about his movie under fake accounts - no biggie - but how many did he do here? 50? Holy smokes. This director owes me some money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a surprising gem, I can't believe I never heard of this film. It's beautifully crafted and sensitive, including the photography and the inventive soundtrack. This was a beautiful blend of excellent craftsmanship and quiet intensity in acting, storyline and composition, particularly since the film contains so many quieter and lesser known, but thoroughly talented character actors. Even the subplots are strong. And Joe Montegna's work was a TOTAL surprise. It takes true skill to move a story between the different levels of feeling that this one achieves, and it never once resorts to clichés, nor does it ever insult the audience's intelligence. Please do more of this quality, America's film industry is desperate for quality of this level. Bravo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie so very much... Max Minghella and Blake Lively, and most of all, Joe Mantagella was touching and brilliant as usual!!! Thanks Lifetime for the greatest movies on TV. We rarely miss your nine o'clock Lifetime movies in this home (pacific time). Our VCR is set to Lifetime TV every night at 9 pm. We especially appreciate your not catering only to the younger generation, as there are many people over 40 years old in this world, many of us. The story lines, for the most part, are original. The quality is excellent as far as editing, director, casting. Keep up the good work. Getting back to this movie, Elvis and Anabelle, it caught me by surprise. I love a good tear-jerker, and good story-line. This movie rates a ten in our book. I would love to see more of Joe Mantagella, please forgive my spelling of his last name. Max Minghella has a bright future in film, I'm sure. Blake Lively was good, these three actor's played very well together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The plot is not the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having no interest in the lifestyle of beauty queens, morticians, or teenage lovers, I did not expect much from this movie. Now I think Will Geiger could make a film about the mating of two squirrels packed with all the revelations of the great American novel. The writer's attention to detail in the script, the talent of the actors, and the color of this one fictional Texas mortician's world made this film much more than what is suggested by its plot line. In those respects, and in its overall gentleness of spirit, this film reminds me of Waking Ned Devine with visuals from Days of Heaven. But in the end this film shows itself to be even more unusual in delivering a message about the difficulty, and the ultimate necessity, of seeing the miraculously good things that sometimes come along after years of loss and depression. I want everyone in my world over the age of 12 to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw it screened at Sonoma Valley Film Festival. Though the location of the screening had issues with small screen and sound, the movie had great drama and shots of moody Texas backdrops.The players contribute well particularly Joe Mantegna as the father.The action moves along and has sufficient surprises to engage well for many movie lovers. the commentary about the "beauty queen" business is underplayed to good dramatic effect.See it or poll the distributors for a DVD release. This one is great family entertainment in fact since it is part fairy story and part adult drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished running a screening of this at the Sonoma Valley Film Festival, and it was fantastic. Outstanding performances by the whole cast, incredible direction and an extraordinary script...if you get a chance to see it, see it. You won't be sorry.Of particular note are the young stars of the film, Max Minghella and Blake Lively, neither of whom I'd seen in films before, but both of whom were amazing. Such well-crafted performances deserve more praise than I can give in this space, but they were both phenomenal.I also had the pleasure to meet writer/director Will Geiger, who was gracious and kind, and took time after the screening to speak with everyone who came up to him.Excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT a chic flic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So if you are looking for a fun chic flic to pop in, this is NOT the movie for you! I went into it with this perspective and was greatly disappointed. The girl dies and the guy is her mortician. She is literally cold, dead on the embalming table and he kisses her then she comes to life?! Seriously? I should have known at this point that this movie would be lame. Then the story goes on, with some good moments, but is rather unrealistic. There are also moments of sheer nastiness as he embalms dead bodies, removes their bodily fluids, then takes photos! However, the love story that develops between the two characters, despite his profession, is charming. Then it all goes downhill as the two characters are each about to commit suicide and are stopped by the realization of their love for each other. Really? The ending is so unsatisfying. The movie could have been so much more.</fullReview>
