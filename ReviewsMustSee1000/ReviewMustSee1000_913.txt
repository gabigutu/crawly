		<shortDescription>It was fun, a little breath of fresh-air.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, don't read other reviews about this, it will ruin the unexpected plot and you will probably go in with a negative view. Somebody else said that this isn't a cinematic masterpiece and that's pretty much what i agree with, but it wasn't meant to be, it had some refreshing dialogue that wasn't so much punchlines, but funny conversations,the whole movie itself was just funny in general, the plot was ridiculous but at the same time it was really funny because it was just a big joke. The same people who rate this movie down are the same people who go rate down Schwarzenegger films because they have a silly plot, it's not about the plot, it's about hardcore action and silly punchlines, just like this movie is about funny conversations and a fun plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see a lot of people bashing this film for some reason. Sure it's not some cinematic masterpiece; when I went to see it I wasn't expecting that. "The Watch" is a funny buddy comedy, filled with crude jokes and the silly shenanigans that you'd expect from Stiller, Vaughn, the rest of the cast, and writer Seth Rogen. Like a delicious onion the film does a good job peeling away at the story. Yes, it is not hard see the plot coming, but it's how the characters deal with the situations they encounter, that makes the film entertaining. Crybaby critics with their stuck up trendy smugness, "See, told you the plot was predictable.." Wow, way to over dramatize the obvious, you're so clever. I bet that "Titanic" ending took you by surprise? For all those critics who whine and cry about "The Watch" maybe they should just stay home and watch one of their Disney classics on VHS. This is a great film to see, escape the chaotic world and have a few laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, I had a good time with it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, this movie is a clear sign that some film-makers still care about making a good comedy. The movie is not just simple, cheap, predictable laughs, it actually is being one that relies on its story development and character buildup.No, I'm not saying that this is a very clever or brilliantly written and made movie but I definitely prefer the approach of this movie above that of the average and more standard modern comedy. This is being a somewhat more subtle movie with all of its comedy and how it got incorporated into the movie.Thing that made this movie especially great and fun to watch for me were its characters. The movie truly is mostly about its characters and their interactions with each other. All of the actors play quite well off each other and manage to give their characters some distinctive and enjoyable personalities. Really, without the movie its characters and actors portraying them, this would had most likely been a terribly weak movie.It's true that most of the actors are playing the same type of characters they often play. Ben Stiller again plays a normal guy, who gets caught up in a crazy situation and Vince Vaughn basically is being a big man-child again. But somehow it all works out quite well and entertaining for the movie and I even dare to say that some of the biggest Stiller and/or Vaughn haters still could get some enjoyment out of this movie and not feel annoyed by their performances and characters. It's hard not to really spoil this movie but it's about something way more than just about a neighborhood watch, with a bunch of misfits in it. There are some interesting and unexpected developments in this movie, at least when you haven't heard about them already. I won't say anything about it, since I feel that it's more fun to just go into this movie, without knowing what is going to happen in it. So I advice you to also stay away from any trailers and just let this movie surprise you.I simply had a good time watching this movie!7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most comedies starring Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller and/or any of the Frat Pack, people are going to complain that this was gross, unfunny, ridiculous, etc. But they clearly expect too much from these guys. If you go into this movie thinking that you'll fall on the floor laughing then yes, you will disappointed. But I expected nothing and I laughed my butt off. It's a silly movie with a silly plot and it knows this. If you don't like Vince Vaughn or Ben Stiller, then don't see it. It's that simple. If you do like them, give it a try. I'll definitely watch it again because it was entertaining in the most over the top way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, disjointed and totally lacking in humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never claimed to be a screenwriter (nor would I even try to), but it seems to me that if "The Watch" had just been about a group of goofy, inept, over-the-top neighborhood watchmen, then it could have been a much tighter, coherent and interesting endeavor. Under the eye of director Akiva Schaffer ("Hot Rod") and penmanship of writers Jared Stern, Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen, however, the film is badly-managed and all over the map ? thematically speaking. I use "writing" loosely, though, since much of the dialogue was ad-libbed by leads Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, and the undisciplined approach certainly shows with these vulgar and stilted performances.Adding murder, mutilation, orgies and an ill-conceived alien invasion just shows the desperation (and bloated budget) the cast and crew were forced to work with. Never has the phrase "less is more" been so sorely needed in a so-called comedic production.Thus, the first pairing of Stiller and Vaughn since 2005&#x2032;s "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story" is sadly wasted as the laughs come few and far between. And, when they do, they are usually overshadowed by following sequences of slaughter, mayhem and utter confusion that leaves both casual film patron and experienced movie critic scratching their collective heads in complete bewilderment.The ludicrous plot has longtime Costco manager Evan (Stiller) grieving over the killing of a Mexican security guard in a most offensive and stereotypical scene. Starting a comedy with a vicious, bloody murder is hardly the best way to go, but that is just the beginning of this film's problems.Appearing in front of a high school football audience (in one of the few really funny sequences), Evan makes an appeal for neighborhood watch recruits, but can only attract three weirdos ? Bob (Vaughn), Franklin (Jonah Hill, fresh from "21 Jump Street" and an Oscar- nominated performance in "Moneyball") and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade) ? who use the situation to get away from their wives and family members and look to get drunk and party.The quartet is a joke (a really UNfunny joke, however), being ridiculed by smart-mouthed teens, random citizens and local law enforcement. When more murders take place, though, as well as the discovery of a forthcoming alien invasion, the group begins to suspect most everyone in the small Ohio town is involved (because, evidently, the invaders can also assume human form, any further plot explanation is really unnecessary at this point).Along the way there are also several pointless subplots in "The Watch," one including Bob's slutty daughter, Chelsea (Erin Moriarty) and her sexcapades, as well as Evan's low sperm count; neither of which is even remotely interesting or humorous. Lame supporting characters include Will Forte ("MacGruber") as the disbelieving town cop, and Rosemarie DeWitt ("Your Sister's Sister"), as Evan's non-descript wife. Then, the final conflict takes place at the Costco store and, like the rest of the enterprise is boring, confusing and nowhere near comedic at it needed to be.And so "The Watch," the much-anticipated Stiller-Vaughn reunion (well, anticipated by SOME people, I suppose), falls flat on its face. The painfully humorless and obscene story, that meanders around like a rudderless alien spacecraft, makes this comedy one of the most disappointing and depressing adventures of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, but boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a collection of actors seemingly in need of a paycheck; it is slow, largely unfunny and boring. There were few genuine laughs and I found myself straining to laugh at scenes that really weren't worth the effort. Ben Stiller plays the same character he has played a dozen times and I am struggling to remember a single funny line he issued. Vince Vaughn had a few funny moments, but again, he played the same character we've seen in all of his prior movies. And, Will Forte, he only has one character. At least he was irritating. Costco was funnier than any of these has-beens and never-weres. The plot was contrived and struggled to stay together throughout. I would have walked out but for Jonah Hill, who was genuinely funny and needs to stop carrying other people's movie's. Even with his moments of brilliance, I could not wait for the movie to be over. This will be the last Ben Stiller movie I will ever see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brainless entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a supermarket manager, who forms a neighbourhood watch after his employee was brutally killed in his supermarket."The Watch" is a light-hearted and fun rendition of a few unlikely heroes who save the world from alien invasion. The whole plot s so far fetched and ridiculous, that it means "The Watch" cannot be taken seriously. There is a metal ball capable of mass destruction, there is a super hunk that turns out to be more than he is, and the weak spot of the aliens is located in a particular area of the body. The dialog is juvenile and silly, but "The Watch" is all about brainless entertainment. If you treat it like a joke, you will have a lot of laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally unfunny waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Turned it off after the first 30 minutes, during which I never so much as chuckled once but rolled my eyes plenty. The majority of the obviously intended comedic lines were either vulgar, sexual, immature or a combination of all three. If that's your thing, you might find this to be a funny movie, otherwise you're far more likely to be disgusted. The remainder of the attempted humor involved Vince Vaughn rambling on far, far too long in blatantly obvious ignorance to the task at hand. I know that's supposed to be the humor, but it just isn't. At all. And worse yet, it's just really annoying. I had higher hopes for Richard Ayoade, who was hilarious in the series IT Crowd, but the gratuitously vulgar and sexual references shoehorned into the dialog significantly detracted from my previous opinion of him. But here again, if you're taste in humor includes jokes about someone hoping to have their balls sucked, this is probably right up your alley. While I can't say that I've ever found Vince Vaughn's trademark (and only) character terribly funny, Ben Stiller can play a genuinely funny roll. Whether it's a career on the wain or just a bad plot/script, this is not one of Stiller's better performances. So again, YMMV, but I found this to be totally without any humor, and bordering on painful to watch. I'm less intelligent for having watched 30 minutes of this turd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was horribly unfunny! I almost fell asleep from all the boring dialogue and badly written script! Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, and Jonah Hill are now amongst the most unfunny and unoriginal funny guys of Hollywood! Which means at one point of their careers they actually were funny and original but now their out of touch! This movie is not as bad as Adam Sandler's movies that have been nothing but a crap fest lately but it is definitely up there! Don't expect this movie to be a box office hit but more like a movie that didn't need to be made especially with what went down in Florida and the Neighborhood watch! Which is why the name changed to begin with! You wonder sometimes how these movies even get made or how it passed the editing floor it's ridiculous!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting Sci-Fi Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Watch' is An Interesting Sci-Fi Comedy, that makes good-use of its promising premise &amp; its well-decorated star-cast. Its Fun! 'The Watch' Synopsis: Four men who form a neighborhood watch group as a way to get out of their day-to-day family routines find themselves defending the Earth from an alien invasion.'The Watch' isn't flawless. It has its share of minuses. But, overall, this first of its kind Sci-Fi Comedy appeals, because it makes you laugh at the right places &amp; the performances are commendable. Talking of minuses, the uneven second-hour acts as a deterrent. Jared Stern, Seth Rogen &amp; Evan Goldberg's Screenplay has merit. However, the second-hour, certainly, could've been more persuasive. Akiva Schaffer's Direction is credible. Cinematography &amp; Editing are mentionable. Graphics are pretty cool. The Aliens are pretty creepy to look at!Performance-Wise: Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill &amp; Richard Ayoade are the life of 'The Watch'. Stiller is highly efficient, while Vaughn continues to impress us with his impeccable comic-timing. Hill &amp; Ayoade are equally effective, adding much more to their characters than offered. Also, the on-screen chemistry between the four of them, is interesting. Rosemarie DeWitt does her bit well. Will Forte is sincere.On the whole, 'The Watch' does work, at most parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of talent!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2012 was a really rough year for Ben Stiller, with 'Tower Heist' barely breaking even ($75M budget/$78M domestic/$152M worldwide) and 'The Watch' a bona fide box office flop ($68M budget/$35M domestic/$68M worldwide). So you have to ask yourself, how could a film which featured Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, and Jonah Hill have failed so miserably? Three words, "IT WASN'T FUNNY"!!!!! Plus I really have to question director Akiva Schaffer's vision for this film? what was this film suppose to be? A comedy, a sci fi film, an alien invasion flick, a murder investigation who-done-it film, a buddy flick, or a neighbor watch group defending its home turf movie??? My suggestion would have been to pick one genre and run with; however, this film trying to be all of these movies was just too insurmountable to achieve!!!!Ben Stiller stars as Evan, a local Costco manager. When his nightshift security guard is mysteriously killed (and skinned) while at work, Evan organizes a neighborhood watch group to find the perpetrator of this hideous crime. However, the ragtag group of individuals who answer his flyers include the following: Bob (Vince Vaughn), a husband desperately seeking other men's camaraderie; Franklin (Jonah Hill), a police academy reject; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), the token black guy.This bumbling foursome is able to uncover that aliens have invaded their little metropolis, and are walking amongst the human populace in the skinned carcasses of their victims. Furthermore, the aliens are also on the verge of completing a radio transmitter which will signal their home planet, and commence a planetary invasion. However, to make this film into a "comedy", writers Jared Stern and Seth Rogen decided that the only way the kill the invading horde is to shoot them in the nads, nuts, penis region. This film fails miserably on every level. On a comedic level, the film isn't funny. As a Sci Fi film, it's comparable to 'Mars Attacks'. There is absolutely zero charisma between any of the actors to justify calling this a buddy picture. For a film to be a successful comedy, the jokes should flow freely and effortlessly; however, this film just tries WAY TOO HARD, and the jokes are forced and unfunny. The film sequence where the watch group apprehends their first alien creature and decides to photograph the event for posterity reasons starts out fine enough, then spirals out of control into some sort drunken frat party gone awry. And as stated above, it's not funny?.This is not a dreadful film; however, this much talent should have been able to produce a raucously hilarious film with little or no effort. But what we (the audience) got was just that? little or no effort. My understanding is that almost 60% of the script was actually adlib / improv'd by the actors. Note to writers?. Do your damn job; comedic actors are only as funny as the written words you have them say!!! I cannot recommend viewing this film. This film is neither good enough to enjoy, nor bad enough to mock, therefore leaving the audience in that indifferent state of being. Indifferent is definitely one place I do not prefer to be when watching a supposed comedy, and would suggest you bypass this humorless travesty.See more of my reviews on FB @ "The Faris Reel"</fullReview>

The actors are all playing characterizations that are two dimensional and that they have repeatedly done before.Nothing new is added. The jokes fall flat. It feels like it was intended for actors half their age but written buy guys twice their age who thought "those young people will think this is funny." It is not.Spare yourself from this one.I can not understand the fairly high rating for this film on this site.

		<shortDescription>There are a few undeniably funny moments of vulgarity styled after the laughs often found in the works of Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's got a great cast, an interesting setup, some hilarious dialogue? and space aliens. The Watch is stocked with immature humor, gross-out gags and crass conversations as one would expect, but once the otherworldly visitors appear, it simply doesn't gel. The concept of defending against an extraterrestrial invasion has been successfully merged with humor before (see Men in Black, Mars Attacks! and Attack the Block), but here it feels like an afterthought, neither authentic nor necessary in conveying a story of misfit buddies attempting to protect their town. There are a few undeniably funny moments of vulgarity styled after the laughs often found in the works of Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen, but these segments feel misplaced in a film that can't wrap itself around a sensible plot to showcase the comedy. Evan Trautwig (Ben Stiller) loves his town of Glenview, Ohio and is deeply devoted to both the community and his job as the manager of the local Costco. But when the night guard at his store is brutally murdered, Evan determines to get even more involved and creates his own "neighborhood watch" to help the undermanned police department track down the killer. Recruiting Bob (Vince Vaughn), an overprotective father who just wants to hang out with the guys, Franklin (Jonah Hill), a trigger-happy maniac rejected by the police department for mental instability, and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a mild-mannered Brit with a fantasy of rescuing lonely housewives, Evan attempts to lead his misfit gang in search of clues. When the group uncovers the unearthly beings behind the crime, they must band together to save not only their beloved town, but also the whole world. The Watch is a confusing mess of genres, delving into comedy, horror (with bloody violence and slimy monstrosities), drama, romance (of the light-hearted kind), and action/adventure (bizarrely fixating on slow-motion shootouts). At times, even when it's just comedic, it switches between slapstick, situational, dialogue-driven, teen-oriented, and raunchy. It never knows what it wants to be, partly thanks to the shifting styles and perhaps mostly due to the current events surrounding the real life Neighborhood Watch shooting in Florida; a tragic incident and extremely unfortunate coincidence for the marketing of this movie ? forcing plenty of edits and the changing of the title. Regardless of the controversial subject matter, the unearthly direction The Watch chooses to go spells certain doom for the effectiveness of the humor. Like a spoof of Invasion of the Body Snatchers coupled with a cross between Men in Black and Old School, there's simply no home for the vast range of unrelated settings, characters, actions, and conversations (largely involving bodily fluids as if preoccupied with duplicating the verbiage of Superbad ? which is not surprising considering scripting by Seth Rogen). Tackling the classic scenario of a common, quiet little suburb becoming immersed in extraordinary occurrences (with a few central roles being the only ones aware of the situation), The Watch borrows too heavily from previously established filmic premises. What's worse is the promising ensemble cast, which looks good on paper but results in disinterest. Stiller is once again the straight man, insistent on doing his job; Vaughn is the loud-mouthed instigator; and Hill is the kooky oddball, spouting most of the off-the-wall comments and revealing his life to be the least matured. Will Forte rounds out the group with an amusing appearance as the stereotypical, incompetent, overconfident cop. While themes of isolation, suspicion, control, reclaiming family values, and expending limitless ammo in an environment free from sincere physical consequences seep into the mundane plot, the disorganized and extraneous feel of many of the scenes causes The Watch to be a consistently threadbare bore. - The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got about 20 minutes into this... this dreadful, tiresome, mind numbing, "comedy" and that was all I could take. I tried to find humour in Ben Stiller's performance but I'm sorry, I'm not 10 years old and don't do dope or take drugs of any kind. I just don't find Ben Stiller funny in any of his films though I bet there are any number of people behind the camera laughing at his every wide eyed attempt at ironic humour, his manager, his agent, his psychiatrist etc. Frankly, I don't think even he gets it. His idea of comedy died with the Three Stooges. Only Phil Silvers can carry off being Phil Silvers (even Steve Martin must be aware of that by now) know what I mean. Be original! The first rule of comedy is IT HAS TO BE FUNNY! It wasn't. I'd like to see Stiller in a dramatic gritty role for a change. I bet he'd make a great action actor with say Bruce Willis; he'd nail it. I have yet to see a subtle comic performance from him. Those eyes and expressions of his have been done to death. The only one who made me remotely smile was Richard Ayoade a man who through his hit UK sitcom The IT Crowd, which made the absurd brilliantly hysterical, has a genuine feel for absurd throw away dialogue. Jonah Hill can be very very funny and anarchic but in this he was miscast, sorry Jonah. Vince Vaughn "If-I-shout-loud-enough-it'll-be-funny" brand of comedy just annoyed me. It was insulting. They were all doing their own bit but none of them seemed to be relating to the others. Yes if that was the point, it didn't work. Anyone one of their characters in reality would have walked away from the others. Comedy comes out of real situations. None of that had any sense of reality about it. It was like a low budget remake of The Burbs (kind of) but without the class and black humour. My advice is don't watch it. Go and paint your car or knit yourself a suit of armour or something. You'd be better employed.</fullReview>

I think Ben Stiller can be funny when he is by himself than teaming up with others to be funny. I loved the Zoelander for sure , I loved all the Fockers sequels except for the Christmas one.

I am huge admirer of IMDb and use it a lot to research wonderful foreign movies. But, sometime you get surprise like this one. This movie is clearly not in range of almost 9 stars. 2 stars it could get ONLY if all viewers from this culture give highest ratings in some strange exhibition of solidarity. 3-4 stars is too high for it unless you need that cultural diversity. Who, in right state of mind, give it more than 1 star, is only question that keeps you watching past 5 minutes. To watch it to the end is too ambitious of a task. Avoid this movie unless you are doing research on psychology of IMDb users.</fullReview>

His range is about 3 degrees. You could cut and paste his facial expression and dialog into any of his last dozen movies. I suppose you have to give the guy credit for making the most of what he had. I can't see where in 15 years any of these actors will be playing at the box office. I know I have been tough on these guys but come on this is just not good and a waste of capital.

Well I can see Jonah Hill in it, he usually does pretty bad movies in my opinion. There is no real humor in the movie, the acting is very poor, the writing is terrible, and who knows why this was even produced. The CGI aliens are fairly well done but do come across as just a rip of the Aliens movies. The supposed sex scenes don not show anything, which is not a bad thing, but they are extremely hookie. The police sergeant is a typical comedy tool that of course comes around at the end of the show.</fullReview>

As I haven't watched it to the end, I have to right to comment on specifics, its not worth the hassle anyway. This is appalling.however making up space:Seeing the name Ben Stiller, I watched it thinking that at least it would be OK, however this just shows that even big names can drop a howler at times. The script writing is awful, the dialogue woeful and it was actually painful to watch to the point I got too, not that far in to be host. The moment it became plain Ben Stiller's character was going to 'humorously' get the blame for a second murder as well as the first both without reasonable cause, I had to switch it off.

Vince Vaughn had a few enjoyable lines and snarky moments, and it was enjoyable to see him cast as a father-figure, but the moments were few and far between. Jonah Hill was afforded the same minimal time to show his talents, which is truly disappointing. Ben Stiller leads the cast, and while he's afforded ample screen time and is the narrator, it does not play into his strengths and leaves you wanting more.*Spoiler Alert* While the addition of aliens could have added to the supposed hilarity of this movie, it only managed to thwart any attempt at humor. The jokes became even more predictable and benign, and I found myself counting the minutes until the movie was over. While I'm glad I never wasted my hard earned money to go see it in the theater, I'm still a bit irked that I even spent $1.50 for the Redbox BluRay rental. I would suggest you save yourself the money, don't even bother with the $0.99 DVD rental and read the Wikipedia synopsis, you might laugh more than as if you were watching the actual movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Regret watching this on a weekday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A watchable film. Does have humor, but neither smart like South Park nor LOL-inducing. Cheesy and predictable, but somehow entertaining- nevertheless. The film seems to be a unhappy mash-up of different film genres, with too little of everything. For me, the special effects budget didn't really show, the alien animations were good and the concept of a neighborhood watch fighting aliens seemed to be good, but the film is a film with Ben Stiller in it, and you just really cannot expect much from any Ben Stiller film. One thing I felt that made this film okay, was that one of the film's key turning points (where the British dude is revealed to be an alien) made the film seem like Avatar 2, or any "white people betray their own to help natives their invading film", except that it's reverse, where aliens help humans fight their own race due to some magical encounter with the natives (in this case, a local orgy). However, I was really disappointed when the protagonists decided to go stop the alien transmission from being sent (if you haven't seen the film, now you know the whole story). It would have been interesting though if the protagonists went with the British alien's advice and hid out in the deserts. Anyways, this is again one of those time killing films, so if you have nothing important to do, watch this film to kill time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>COULD of been a great film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to watch a comedy, something light hearted with my boyfriend so I chose The Watch as it had a great cast in it and it had good reviews.Although I was very much enjoying the film, the thing that ruined it was all the sleazy comments made about women and the orgy scene was completely unnecessary. The film was funny enough without it.I don't think this film caters to women at all, it's all aimed at men, with the "hot" young girls in skimpy revealing clothing and even in the sex scene good looking young girls with gross fat old/middle-aged men. With all the sexual fantasies which men have and their "jokes" towards women.It made it very uncomfortable to watch with my partner and I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone watches this with their family.This is my own opinion, everyone will have their own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sad day has come where a comedy means plenty of bad " dick " jokes, terrible dialogue, weird symbolism and more unfunny stuff. The cast and producers should be ashamed of what movies have become, and they probably are, guess they don't have a choice anymore. Hope that when the aliens invade, if they are not already here, they burn down Hollywood first. Wasted my time on this, hoping it would turn around before the end, so don't waste yours. I've watched plenty of Ben Stiller movies in my life, and they were all pretty nice, especially Starsky and Hutch, so I can't understand what happened here. Proves once again that actors probably don't have much say in the quality of films produced where they act, they're just in for the money and whatever else, god knows. Maybe they should put up a fine for this kind of movies, where you get your money back, if it's that bad. And I didn't know there are so many German sounding names in the US. A sad day, indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't watch The Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason why a film like The Watch falls flat on its face is because it thinks that just because that there's cursing, it's funny... It's not funny. It was never funny, and I personally think that it was intentionally trying to drill this "hilarious" thought into our minds. The most cursing I've ever seen in a film and most of it didn't make sense at all. I just wasted two hours on a movie I should have never seen to begin with. The talent in this film was completely wasted. Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn haven't made a decent film since 2005, so there's no use to talk about them. Jonah Hill and that Richard Ayoade were the talent that was squandered in this film. The least I can say was that Ayoade was likable. All of the others were filthy mouthed selfish perverts who had no decency or intelligence to steer the movie in the right direction. Personally, judging from the score above is how I can never recommend this movie to you. You're welcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disgusting piece of trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the work of Akiva Schaffer, Jorma Taccone and Andy Samberg in the "troupe" The Lonely Island; however, the experience has shown over and over again that they have less luck when they work individually than as a trio; in other words, the combination of talents is more than the sum of its parts. I mention this because the film The Watch, directed by Schaffer and with cameos from Taccone and Samberg, is very far from reaching the humor, irreverence and energy we habitually find in their collective work, and is a horrible "comedy" with a pathetic screenplay.The combination of contradictory genres can bring good results, but in the sad case of The Watch, the mixture of comedy, sci-fi and thriller feels absolutely forced and like an arbitrary collection of incongruent scenes which don't contribute to the narrative, but which only exist as mini-sketches of a bad quality. On the comedy level, The Watch is too predictable, with the expected scatological jokes and vulgarity which don't even work (the five-minute scene about urinating into a jar reveals a lot about the auto-indulgence from co-screenwriters Jared Stern, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg...and their probable level of intoxication while writing the screenplay). As a thriller, The Watch also fails because it never creates suspense in order for us to get worried about the characters. And the least I say about the sci-fi aspect of The Watch, the better.The alliance of Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and Richard Ayoade sounds good on paper, but unfortunately, they are totally wasted in The Watch. I know that the economical failure of a film rarely indicates its real quality, but I think that the fact that The Watch flopped is widely justified, because it's an execrable and irritating waste of time. Needless to say that I recommend you to avoid this piece of trash like the plague.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Foul Mouthed But Not Very Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ben Stiller comedy "The Watch" qualifies as a botch. Initially, Twentieth Century Fox had planned to release this prurient, lowest common denominator farce with the title "Neighborhood Watch." When news from Florida broke that authorities had arrested an armed neighborhood watch volunteer and charged him with the murder of an unarmed African-American youth, the image-conscious studio deleted "Neighborhood" from the title. Anybody who tries to connect this tragic, true-life shooting with "Hot Rod" director Akiva Schaffer's loutish lowbrow laffer is stretching their argument mighty thin. Basically, this raunchy comedy about four suburbanites who avert an alien invasion reminiscent of "Battleship" from outer space yields little hilarity. Stiller plays his usual uptight but affable buffoon. He struggles desperately throughout this second-rate slapstick saga to earn respect from anybody. Typically, the best comics are those who don't call attention to themselves. Stiller isn't the only one of the four who plays it as if "The Watch" were a melodrama. Meanwhile, Stiller's gesticulatory co-star Vince Vaughn relies on his lame-brained, motor-mouthed loquacity to mine comedy from the least amusing things. For example, he finds it incredibly hilarious that he can pull one smaller doll after another larger one in a Russian nesting doll collection. Caught in the comic crossfire between Stiller and Vaughn, Jonah Hill holds his own in a performance that channels the sleaze balls that Giovanni Ribisi has played in both "Contraband" and "Ted.". Finally, the most unusual member of this goofy quartet is comedian Richard Ayoade who constitutes the equivalent of scripter Seth Rogen. Without Ayoade's bespectacled, African-English presence and accent, "The Watch" would be too Caucasian for its own good. If Vaughn and Hill stand out as the most repellent of the four, then Stiller and Ayoade are the most likable. Nevertheless, these losers make the silent movie comics The Keystone Kops appear intelligent by comparison.Evan Trautwig (Ben Stiller of "Meet the Parents") manages the Costco Wholesale Warehouse in the sleepy, little town of Glenview, Illinois. Evan gives new meaning to civic awareness. Not only has he organized a neighborhood jogging club, but he also teaches seniors at the community center how to speak Spanish. He has been instrumental also in helping a Hispanic security guard, Antonio Guzman (Joe Nunez of "Superbad"), obtain his American citizenship. No sooner has Antonio celebrated his new status as an American citizen than he dies under mysterious circumstances during his night shift at Evan's Costco. The manner of Antonio's death is hopelessly horrific; whatever killed him took his skin. Evan is upset when the local police fail to develop any leads other than 'a wild animal' premise in the demise of his night watchman. One of the smart aleck policemen, Sergeant Bressman (Will Forte of "Rock of Ages"), amuses himself when he implicates Evan in the murder. Conscientious citizen that he is, Evan decides to form a neighborhood watch. During an intermission at a Glenview High Spartans' football game, our hero wears a T-shirt with the words NO MORE MURDERS on it and announces his ambitious plans. The spectators ridicule his well-meaning efforts. Later, at his residence, our hero waits for what he hopes will be a crowd of standing room only proportions. Instead, three guys show up. A construction manager named Bob (Vince Vaughn of "Wedding Crashers"), a psychotic twentysomething called Franklin (Jonah Hill of "21 Jump Street") who lives with his mom and sleeps on a mattress filled with firearms and porno magazines, and recently divorced, community conscious individual known only as Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade of "Submarine") stop by Evan's house to hear him out. These three don't have the same motive as that Evan has. He wants to bring Antonio's killer to justice. Franklin is a high school drop-out who was turned down by the local police. Bob joins because he needs a night off from his wife to bond with his buds. The group gets off to a rocky start when they relocate to Bob's man cave to enjoy beers while Evan outlines his plans for a watch group.. They argue about what their insignia should be and wind up wearing jackets with flying, flaming Chinese tigers. During their first night out as 'the watch,' they are ticketed by Sergeant Bressman for having open containers of beer in Evan's Chevy mini-van and Evan is ticketed for posting 200 posters without a license. Eventually, our heroes bust a high school kid who mercilessly pelts them with eggs at the high school football stadium. Later, they tangle with an alien had fire an endless number of bullets into it that only stun it. Little do they know that the only way to stop these aliens is to rip off their genitalia! Eventually, our heroes discover they are contending with extraterrestrial adversaries. These ugly looking aliens have holed up in Evan's Costco Warehouse because it contains everything they need under one roof. Talk about obvious product placement! The aliens kill Earthlings without a qualm and bleed green slime. They have established their base of operations in the Costco warehouse basement. Their chief weapon is a metallic, basketball shaped object that fires a beam that disintegrates objects. Our half-witted heroes stumble onto it and atomize a harmless cow in a pasture. Along the way, they encounter some eccentric people whom they suspect are aliens disguised as humans. One of these is Evan's next door neighbor, Paul (Mitt Romney lookalike Billy Crudup of "Public Enemies"), who behaves suspiciously until they learn what he is doing that attracts so many people. "Mr. Popper's Penguins" scenarist Jared Stern along with "Pineapple Express" scribes Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg manage to slip in some surprises. Nevertheless, they have penned better comedies. The profane, locker-room dialogue is cockamamie-oriented, and the guys are obsessed with male genitalia. "The Watch" resembles an uninspired spin on both "Ghostbusters" as well as "Men in Black." If you like to watch movies where guys gush about the penis, you'll enjoy "The Watch."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given the all star comedy cast you walk into the cinema with high hopes (generally not a good idea for a film), but you are confronted with very few moments of actual comedy compared to the majority of lame jokes in the film. Very few films maintain a good level of comedy throughout the film and this is no exception as the comedy was very spaced out and produced a giggle at best.I think this film could have been very well made and the acting could have been better, most actors are good at one kind of acting in a specific area and the characters seemed to show it as everyone looked as though they were out of their comfort zone (apart from Richard Ayoade who seemed to really get along with his character).All in all I believe that if you were looking forward for this film wait for the DVD otherwise it isn't really worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film will never win any prizes but it was fun to watch and the plot advanced fairly quickly. Some jokes, some slapstick -- and a completely failed urine-in-a-beer-can set up that had no pay-off. Would it have been so hard to have someone drink it? The film is ramped from a 5 to a 7 by the superb performance of Richard Ayoade, who I honestly think could make the word 'hello' hilarious. While pretty much everything about the film is predictable, even to the point of the recycling of several catchphrases from other films (and I think 'the wife' was underutilised -- she could have made a brilliant Ripley-esque character), It was fast-enough and witty enough to make it worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here in Hollywood we value diversity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts off with narration: "Here in Glenview we value diversity. I myself am friends with an old Indian man? etc." Meanwhile, the credits roll. "Starring: Ben Stiller, Jonah Hill. Casting by: Alyssa Weisberg. Co-producer: Jeffrey Wetzel, Billy Rosenberg. Film Editor: Dean Zimmerman. Executive Producers: Dan Levine, Monica Levinson. Produced by: Shawn Levy. Written by: Jared Stern, Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg." Catch my drift?Anyway? enough about diversity in Hollywood. On to this semi-fine comedy produced and written by a whole array of vastly diverse people, nationalities, and races. Can anyone say "hypocrites"? Sorry, there's me babbling about diversity. I'm just as bad as Ben.TW is a mildly entertaining comedy, most of its positives stemming from the simple fact that it's about an alien invasion. I know, not exactly an original premise, but comedies aren't supposed to be original, they're supposed to be first-and-foremost funny. TW delivers a few laughs here and there but by-and-large the gags and jokes bomb. Why? Because TW suffers from the same ailment as nearly all modern comedies: a lack of LESS IS MORE.An example: the argument about peeing and drinking beer in a parked car. It goes on and on, into absurdity ? but not in a good, funny, intelligent Monty Pythonish way. Rather, the excessive verbal diarrhea that permeates so many bad and mediocre comedies these days is more on the embarrassing side. Cringe time. It's stuff written by a very "diverse" bunch, a closely-knit group that must believe that only they somehow have the abilities to write, direct and produce comedies. Evidently, they're wrong. And anyway, their 60s/70s/80 ancestors were so much better at it. Anyone remember Walter Matthau? No more Walter Matthaus, I'm afraid ? but a LOT of Ben Stillers and Adam Sandlers. (Sorry, Ben, for lumping you together with Sandler; compared to him, you're a comic genius, not at all just another overrated nepotist runt.)Jonas and Vince, while on the surface seeming to be playing very different characters, essentially do the same tiresome shtick: they gab on and on, continuing a joke into infinity, squeezing it dry like a bad lemon, diluting it with their Improv-sounding nonsense until there's nothing left of it ? be it a gag that started off with potential or an unfunny idea to begin with. LESS IS MORE; I can't say that often enough. Don't BLEED A GAG DRY. Just use it and then MOVE ON. Seth Rogen and company need to finally understand this. Seth is a good comic, but his writing abilities leave a bit to be desired. But I forget: nowadays every actor is a mega-multi-talent who produces (anyone who has money can produce), directs (with modern technology any jackass can direct these days, especially with the help of an experienced cinematographer), and writes (anyone can write shoddy or average scripts).Going back to diversity, don't you love it how diverse Hollywood is? A whole ARRAY of Arquettes, Carradines, Fondas, Coppolas, and Barrymores. You can't ? you just CAN'T ? get more diversity than that. Not to mention the other type of Hollywood "diversity" I'd mentioned earlier on.</fullReview>

A lot of the seems as though it's daring you to laugh while knowing that it's all low humor. I guess that Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn and the rest were willing to act in a movie whose main composition is jokes about bodily functions. I will admit that it's easy to giggle at much of what happens. Basically, the movie is stupid and funny at the same time. Even so, the Simon Pegg-Nick Frost outing "Paul" is a funnier alien-themed movie.And remember: they walk among us (just like "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and "They Live").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny despite Hollywood contrivances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cast do a great job fulfilling their roles in this film with Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn playing up to their strengths in this assemble cast of comedy actors. The two standouts however are Richard Ayoade and Jonah Hill who bring a breath of fresh air to the quartet. Especially Ayoade who brings a sense of unknowing to his role to those unfamiliar to his work. The problems don't stem with the humour or casting choices it is where typical plot devices are thrown in and typical Hollywood rears it's head. Saying that in this movie it seems to fit the style and the overall story in that it explains why characters act the way they do. Ben Stiller's Evan and his wife are trying to have a baby but can't because he is sterile. So it is reasonable to expect him to over compensate by being deflective and aloof. Yeah it has a Hollywood stench over it but it actually is believable. Vince Vaughn's character is concerned over his daughter and explains his motivation to join the watch. More contrived than the other story but still has a basis in reality. At times the plot is predictable but does pleasantly surprise as well. Overall, not a master piece but it has a lot of funny moments and is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually a movie that get really terrible reviews such as this film, The Watch would turn me away. But being a Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn fan, I had to watch this film and see if it's bad as critics and plain viewers made it seem. It's actually half-way decent and there are some pretty funny, though rather vulgar jokes. I really liked the film premise and the film had a chance to be comedy gold, but in the end despite being entertaining, the comedy felt forced at times and the vulgarity seems to go through the roof.Akiva Schaffer's film is about a Costco night guard who was mysteriously murdered. In response to the murder, straight-laced Evan forms a neighborhood watch to track down the killer. But all he gets is three dimwits and together they discover the murderer may be.....extraterrestrial.I find it unfortunate how the careers of Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn are steadily declining. They are both really funny men and while not at their best, they do have some genuine funny moments here. Jonah Hill is on a nice streak of late but I don't know if I would consider this film a setback for him or not. Finally, Richard Ayoade is pretty good even though did not expect much out of him.Overall, the Watch is a good, but could have been a way better film. It has a nice, central premise and I liked the sci-fi element of the film. There are some interesting creature designs here, but I wouldn't call them original and I'll leave it to the viewers to see. I rate this film 7/10.</fullReview>

The only thing able to save such a film from the boring and overdone recipes of the past was to mix the genres in a comedy about immature middle aged dudes playing tough mofos in a scary Sci-Fi context. So, while being predictable in places, the film has some rather laughable scenes. And of course a silly solution in the end, but who cares? Surely aliens won't come here to eat us and wear our skins, then die in a mall with their plugs ripped off. So don't take everything so serious, folks. Or maybe such a movie would have worked better without the serious threat thingy, for it would have been even more ridiculous then.</fullReview>

I'm not a prude, but the language just didn't fit here.This should have been a PG-13 rated movie and been a bit more slapstick. For some reason they made what should have been a silly summer movie into something much heavier than it need to be.It's not surprising that this movie was a box office loser, but after the Trayvon Martin shooting it's amazing that it even made the amount of money it did.Frankly, given what happened in that case the producers probably should have left this on the shelf for a couple more years before releasing it. It would still have been a bad movie, but it wouldn't have seemed to be in such bad taste as it does now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't fantastic, but it isn't that bad either. I did enjoy it, but it was certainly not a barrel of laughs (I think I only laughed a grand total of once during the entire movie, and that was only a slight chuckle). Basically it is your standard American tried hard comedy that is entertaining, but only once. It is not really a movie that you would go out of your way to hire, or even spend an afternoon going to the cinema to see (well, okay, if you are already at the cinema and the choice is a bunch of movies you have either already seen, or don't want to see). The only reason that I hired it from the video shop was because it had aliens in it.Ben Stiller opens the movie with the statement that he lives in the greatest town, in the greatest country on the greatest planet, and statements like that do tend to put me off. Mind you, being Australia, and despite all of this country's flaws (not that there are many of them) I would rather live here than anywhere else (except for maybe the Netherlands, or Germany, but only when it is not snowing).To give him credit though, Ben Stiller is really good at playing a rather boring and average man, though as is typical with all Hollywood movies of this type, he has a hot wife who gets a little narky with him, but when he comes clean all is forgiven. However, what I really like about this movie was Richard Ayoarde, who for those who don't know, was the really cool guy in The IT Crowd. It is good to see him actually appearing in other movies, and still retaining that innocent geek aspect about him.Okay, this movie really did seem to come out of the cookie-cutter though, because you had aliens, you had goof balls, you had pretty much nothing that really made you laugh, and you had the alien that realises that Earth is actually a pretty good place and that humans are actually pretty good people, so he switches sides at the last minute. However, like a lot of more modern American movies, the humour is simply getting cruder and cruder, and this seems to simply be for the sake of being crude. Somehow it comes across to me as a little too try hard. In a way it seems as if quite a lot of American comedies are going down the path of crudeness simply for the sake of being crude, and in a way it spoils the movie. Even the joke at the end, where it turns out the the alien's brains are in their member's simply was not funny, or if it was supposed it be, it simply came across to childish and seemed to belong back in highschool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is so bad I want to unsee it. I hear concussions work for amnesia. This movie is SO awful, I'm thinking about running my head in a wall. These guys sat around for half of the movie talking about their penises. Worse, there wasn't a single funny laugh to be conjured up despite the hours spent throwing out line after line. After discovering a mysterious metal ball, they blow up a cute living cow, and laugh hysterically. Then they blow up barns and hay stacks. Do they report it? No. They find murdered people. Do they report it? No. They also learn we are not alone in the universe, which is the big secret and why a lot of deaths, and gory torn up bodies are showing up. They experience fear for half a second. Do they report it? no. Then they go meet in one of the watch's house, sit around and talk, until one of the men decides to save his daughter's hymen. So he goes there and gets beat up. Meanwhile, the others get invited into a neighbor's house where an orgy is taking place. One guy stays. Eventually they decide to fight the aliens, who seem to be stupidly unarmed, despite having brought the ball which blows up things and the superior technology to invade earth. Instead, they stand there and allow themselves to be shot to death, except the one who for some unexplained reason, had the hots for a human girl even though these things are insects. The Watch mostly stand around and sit around and talk penises throughout all of this 'action'. Did Costco actually pay these guys for product placement rights? Lame doesn't begin to describe this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What has happened to comedy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a film student, I am highly open to new films, both Indie or Hollywood titles. I tend to never pass judgement until the very end (and even then it normally takes me a couple of watches before I give a proper opinion)But in this case, I had simply made my mind up almost a quarter of the way through.There is so much that is wrong with this title, but the biggest chip on my shoulder is the fact that even with such great comedic actors they have to stoop to Genitalia jokes and swearing like their life depends on it.My second biggest gripe with the film is that you can clearly see the tiny amounts of effort that have gone into writing of this film, its as if they have literally sat down at a board meeting and discussed the easiest way to make a quick bit of money on a semi-appealing plot. It almost seems as if they asked their kids: "what would you find funny."And I am highly embarrassed for Richard Ayoade, who is revered for his quirky acting style and impressive writing and directing skills. Not that I have anything against him. Actors have to make a living right...? Right?!Even Schindler's List had more laughs than this cash cow of a Hollywood flop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, vulgar and a waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller and pals form a neighbourhood watch to help solve the murder of a friend, and end up saving his adopted town and the world from an alien invasion.I saw this movie with my sister and we both agreed that it is one of the worst movies that we have ever seen. The plot meanders about to fill in time and the dialogue is so appallingly bad, that I was left wondering how anyone could ever write, let alone finance, such rubbish.Although it is a satire on aliens, the movie had only an occasional half decent joke. What is most disturbing about The Watch, is the obsession of some Hollywood comedies to promote the gay life style as an underlying theme. The gay sex jokes in this movie were vulgar, embarrassing and totally out of place, making a bad movie even worse. I found the same vulgar humour in Horrible Bosses.I would not recommend this film to anyone. It is a total waste of time with zero entertainment value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this movie. I've seen it 5 times now since its DVD release and just continue to enjoy it's light-hearted, fun-filled approach. This movie never takes itself too seriously and delivers repeated laughs, due to great performances from Stiller, Vaughn and Hill. I especially like Vaughn in this one, because he plays more of a nice-guy and not the usually brash, in-your-face character we usually see. The plot is fun - the night guard at Stiller's Costco is brutally murdered while on duty one night and Stiller, who is heavily involved in community projects/groups, decides to organize a neighborhood watch. Only 3 misfit souls join the group, but he presses on nonetheless. During their duties on this watch, they begin to think something VERY strange is taking place in their hood and go about proving so, all the while making us, as the audience, laugh in the process.Fun movie and highly recommend for some honest laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forced Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the main sequence in the Watch, everything that comes to mind is when Neighborhood Watch decides to take pictures with an alien. Then there's the way the movie draws such a huge emphasis to alien genitals and the argument between Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn with implications that last maybe two minutes. The screenplay starts to feel like it's dragging your face in the mud as Jonah Hill's incessant rambling and shouting at his mother along with six or seven dozen unneeded sex jokes make up for much of its unnecessary body mass. Directed by one of SNL writers, it is clear that while watching the Watch, it felt like an SNL sketch that went on far too long.From the start, the aliens in the film have something big planned that keep the four men who make up "Neighborhood Watch" busy and paranoid. This comedy attempting to blend with sci-fi and action might have been better with better writing, and more clever jokes. For starters, the jokes went flat and felt very forced. It was expected with an R rating, but given the R rating, great comedic writers have made it worked. An example would be 21 Jump Street which was released the same year. As we see in the Watch, the film isn't clever enough or interesting enough.</fullReview>

This group, populated by eccentric individuals, stumbles upon various extraterrestrial creatures, whom they proceed to comically destroy.Lazily written, clichd and unfunny, "The Watch" once again finds Stiller wasting himself in a straight-man role. Like most modern films of its ilk, "The Watch" also mistakes "neo-realistic" acting peppered with random vulgarity as "irreverence". Vince Vaughn and Jonah Hill co-star, the latter stealing the show as an emotionally unstable police force reject.3/10 - Worth no viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This would just be a fairly inoffensive, dumb film except for Jonah Hill's character. Considering all the things that have been happening lately, to have a character who is a wannabe cop with strange aggressive sexual behaviors and a large arsenal is just not that funny. I hope they weren't thinking about this when they wrote the character, but there are too many parallels with George Zimmermann. Can't hold a job, can't qualify as a cop, fascinated with guns, still lives under parental protection, joins a neighborhood watch. Too many loser white boys have been thinking they can redeem themselves by shooting someone for their community. This movie should just be innocuous junk food for munching late at night when you want something you will not regret falling asleep during.

		<fullReview>The Watch (2012): Dir: Akiva Schaffer / Cast: Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill, Richard Ayoade, Rosemarie DeWitt: We have two factors here. We have an alien invasion that first strikes at a Costco where a security guard is found splattered throughout the discount sections. Then we have four males who assemble and set out to conquer the problem only to discover that their foe is from outer space. Ben Stiller leads the group as the Costco manager whose background has him involved in numerous support groups. His big hang up is that he cannot get his wife pregnant. Vince Vaughn plays a father whose teenage daughter is involved in a relationship that he forbids. Jonah Hill plays a guy who failed to become a cop. He still lives at home with his mother where he pretends to be independent. Richard Ayoade plays a new neighbour who brings forth comic bewilderment as well as a great plot twist. To be fair, the concept here has appeal but this is no Ghostbusters. The subplots allow the characters to have background, however they are also pointless to the central plot. We know that the climax will be over the top violence with a security guard getting his heart ripped out. The special effects are familiar but work within the alien conventions. The actors are completely type cast but they will appeal to hardcore fans. Smaller roles are another story though. Rosemarie DeWitt plays Stiller's wife and a host of others make brief cameos. Ghostbusters has a more specific agenda with its reality fantasy worldview but fans of the comedians are the one who will desire to watch this spectacle. Score: 5 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie from beginning to end! If you like the cast and their type of comedy I am sure you will love it too!Don't get me wrong it's no masterpiece so I couldn't unbiasedly rate it above a 7. I have spent the last 5 weeks watching a combination of Netflix, Sky movies, DVDs and other online based viewing as I have recently sustained a back injury. So you can imagine by now just watching TV can be a bit tiring even when watching a classic (maybe it's because when re-watching a classic you know the ending!). So I was very surprised to see a trailer for this movie to start within the next hour when aimlessly flicking through the channels of UK terrestrial TV. I set an alarm as a reminder and when alerted I sat back and was hooked right from the start! Pleas be aware I hadn't heard of this title before, so at the end I thought i would take a look at it on IMDb.com and was surprised to see other reviewers rate this below a 5, let alone a 1! If you're not a fan of the actors in this film then don't watch it! Those of you that rated it below a 5 obviously don't like the cast or their type of humour but still watched it just so you could bash the likes of Ben Stiller and all. I felt so strongly about this that I just setup my login and this is my first review. Now I have more time on my hands and a login I may go through more titles where reviewers blatantly have an underlying agenda where all they want to do is give bad reviews to actors they don't like, maybe that or they are not from this planet and related to the foe in this movie!</fullReview>

A good fun movie, made me laugh out loud at least three times, had some good jokes. Nothing serious, a lads movie e.g. full of sex jokes which isn't normally my sort of thing, but this had some good ones, as well as some other good jokes/scenarios, didn't drag, a hell of a lot better than some higher rated comedies. I think it should be 6.8 out of 10 on IMDb, currently at 5.8. It's not a 7 movie for me, as that's for exception films, but this is sturdy entertainment and as I can't see how to rate something 6.8 I have rounded it up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Watch is a science fiction comedy. Ben Stiller is an active member of his local Ohio small town community and a senior manager of the Costco store. When the store's security guard is killed and the police show little interest in investigating the death he forms the neighbourhood watch. However, he only manages to recruit Vince Vaughn, a construction worker, Jonah Hill, who dreams of being a police officer and Richard Ayoade who is new in town.The watch use the group as an excuse to drink and have fun much to Stiller's annoyance. While driving on patrol, they discover a strange metallic orb that acts as a destructive weapon and think it might be of alien origin. They uncover an alien plot threatening the world.The film probably aimed to be the new Ghostbusters but is patchy and falls short. Although there is good repartee between the cast there is an uneasy mixture of gross humour and sci-fi. What should had been a clever action comedy aims for the low brow too often and the humour seems too lazy. Its also saddled with a lot of Costco product placement.</fullReview>

The movie's premise is about a group of 4 men (Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Jonah Hill, and some other guy I didn't recognize) that form a neighborhood watch after a man at Costco is mysteriously murdered, and his skin is taken. The movie keeps your attention, but just barely. The acting is pretty good, but the comedic timing is off. There are about 3 or 4 jokes that made me laugh in my head at this movie, no laugh out loud moments. I thought it was interesting, but it failed at creating anything even close to funny.

		<fullReview>Honestly, I liked this better than I thought I would. For the good, I found some of the comedic riffing (even as infatuated with genitalia and genitalia-related fluids as it was) to be good for a laugh or two. None of it is particularly witty or eloquent, but its delivered with skill and has a certain vulgar charm.For the bad, the script, characters and production are strictly generic. The aliens don't make much sense and their only unique trait is their vulnerability. It feels that the screenwriters knew the script was thin, got drunk, and convinced themselves writing in a third-rate alien invasion plot line was a good idea.Also, I spent half the movie wondering if it should be criticized for featuring Costco so prominently or that the ubiquity of big box stores in our banal suburban consumer hellscapes make such a tie-in necessary to capture modern American life. But I was probably overthinking it.Give it a try if you've worn out your DVDs of Knocked Up, Dodgeball and Superbad and want a bit more of the same done not so well. Even so, you'll likely forget it soon after and not feel inclined to revisit it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Watch has been getting a fair few negative reviews. Yeah, sure, it's no cinematic masterpiece, but I don't think it's meant to be. It's a comedy full of amusing conversations. There aren't really that many punchlines which will have your sides splitting, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have a certain charm.Ben Stiller leads a neighbourhood watch team that accidentally stumbles across an alien plot to take over the world. Yes, it's as silly as it sounds. Yes, there are plenty of unbelievable moments and yes, there are plenty of plot holes. But, there's also so much right with this film, that I think, if you try, you should be able to gloss over any misgivings you may have for this and enjoy it for what it is.It's the perfect movie to sit down and relax your brain. Let the silly men entertain you and snigger at their attempts to save the world. Plus, for all you horror fans out there, the aliens themselves are pretty decent budget with a few gory moments thrown in for added bonus.It's daft, it's smutty, it's silly, but it's also very enjoyable.Kudos to Richard Ayoade for getting his foot into Hollywood's door. Good luck to him - he shows he can hold his own among Hollywood's comedic A-listers.</fullReview>

I had some hopes for him). However I did find some limited amusement in this film, so in that sense this is one of Stiller's better movies. It's hard to say exactly, though, if the film was supposed to be funny or not. OK, it is clearly a comedy, but a situational one, with lots of over the top "ha ha, he's so stupid" jokes and with a sci-fi twist and a moral (well sort of).Bottom line is that I am not sure what it was trying to convey beyond that some movies are better watched at 4X speed.

Jonah Hill isn't exactly desperate for work, so why would stoop to this? I can't say the same for Ben Stiller or Vince Vaughn, because of them have definitely been in some pretty terrible movies. It pains me to realize that Seth Rogen, one of my favorite comedy actors of all time, wrote it! First off, it's about aliens, which you don't really find out about until the end. The movie wasn't as bad until they revealed that, then I was just done with it all. I'm sorry, but I can't name a single good movie about aliens...besides perhaps Mars Attacks. There were a couple of other things going on it that I just didn't care about at all. I think we laughed a total of 5 times and they were just chuckles at best. They definitely showed all of the funniest parts in the trailers, which is my biggest pet peeve. My recommendation is to pretend this movie was never made</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>average Stiller-Vaughn fare - nothing out of the ordinary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On iTunes opinion in reviews are very divided to polar extremes; either it's the worst film ever or awesome and the best. One reviewer said that if your IQ was in triple digits then this was not for you, it was so juvenile and bad. Very few opinions were middle of the road, like mine. Whilst I don't think it's necessarily Seth Rogan's best work, as writer, it's not atypical of anything that Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn do together, or Vaughn-type comedy (see parings with Favreau or Wilson). You know this kind of humour is going to be rude, crude, bawdy, and close to the knuckle in some way, it's going to be ad-libbed, fast-talking, wise-cracking and this is exactly what this boy-humour film delivers; lots of double entendres and Vince bucking the rules. You expect this. It delivers. If penis jokes and scenes of a sexual nature aren't your thing, look away now. This is most definitely a 15 rating. The surprise in this is the wonderful Richard Ayoade in what I think is his first big Hollywood film, as one of the four Neighbourhood Watch guys with Jonah Hill in a slightly different role for him too, he's not the uneasy geek rather a troubled, violent and dark dropout who's hang up is rejection by Police Admissions. Ayoade plays a breakaway from IT Crowd's 'Moss' where he's a wannabe average Joe who's not afraid of girls and is quite the cutie! He plays it with reserved British delivery amongst the sometimes comedic ham of the others. Atypically, none of the main characters are uni-dimensional, and the evolution of the group dynamic is interesting though nothing in this film is unpredictable. It's Hollywood. The SFX aren't that bad, there are a few laughs and clever use of music especially the Lost Boys theme, Echo and the Bunnymen's 'People are Strange.' Overall it's not a misuse of one hour forty minutes, it entertained but didn't particularly elicit any grand reaction one way or the other. Not original for the genre, or witty in any intellectual way, but perhaps subtleties would become apparent on repeat watching. It is what it is... Rogan, Hill, Vaughn, Stiller humour. Make of it what you will.</fullReview>

But no, we have too few jokes for a 102 minutes of running. Good thing is that the few jokes work, especially those made by Vince Vaughn's character. Male audience is more likely to enjoy the jokes, since most of them involve male's thoughts about sex and masturbation. Sadly, the whole story is pretty vague and there's no big excitement or climax to be reached, which occasionally makes this film pointless. Hollywood has surely already made much better comedies than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few Big Laughs but Overall It's a Major Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Watch (2012) ** (out of 4) Disappointing comedy has Evan (Ben Stiller) former a neighborhood watch group consisting of three other guys (Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill, Richard Ayoade) after his friend is murdered. At first the group thinks they're going after a murderer but they soon realize that they're up against aliens. THE WATCH has quite a few laughs scattered throughout it but when you've got Stiller, Vaughn and Hill you expect much more and in this end this film just doesn't live up to much. It's really too bad that the screenplay wasn't better developed because there's a good movie scattered throughout here but there are just way too many lazy moments and scenes that just add up to nothing. It really seems like someone just came up with the idea of a bunch of misfits going after aliens but they didn't add anything extra. There's really not enough going on here to keep you entertained and once the secret of who's doing the killing is out the film doesn't go anywhere with it. Still, there are some very funny gags here along the way. I think the best moments are when the guys are just kicking back and having some fun like the sequence where they start to party with a dead alien. Stiller, Vaughn and Hill do what they can with the material and they certainly give it more laughs than it deserved but at the same time none of them deliver their best work. Rosemarie DeWitt is wasted in her supporting role as is Will Forte. THE WATCH contains some big laughs but just not enough to make the film worth sitting through. It's far from a bad movie but it's still very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Watch ? Silly stuff aplenty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Watch is a silly movie. If you like the delirious antics of Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill, and Will Forte, then you'll like this flick.It doesn't take itself seriously at all, and you shouldn't either. It's all about swearing, drinking, and sex, but twisted from the point of view of a family man, not a party animal or a college student. So the result is a tame adult suburban version of juvenile mayhem.It's totally brainless and each character is at best a parody of a human being. Stiller is not as his silliest and a slim Hill seems to present us a more serious approach to his comedy style with his character, while Vaughn is his wild self.Don't expect anything more than brainless humor, and you'll be happy watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this film which was originally titled Neighbourhood Watch, but then the news broke that a neighbourhood watch volunteer murdered a teenager, it didn't really matter because it looked like it could be a reasonably funny film, written by Seth Rogen. Basically Evan Trautwig (Ben Stiller) is the manager of the Costco department store in the town of Glenview, Ohio, married to Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt), and he takes part in other goodwill activities for the community, such as helping out the elderly, and he is devastated by the death his friend and night watchman Antonio Guzman (Joe Nunez), who recently achieved his American citizenship, he was murdered. In a mission to catch the killer, and other potential lawbreakers of the town, he organises a meeting to find a team of men willing to become part of The Neighbourhood Watch, and soon enough suburban neighbours Bob McAllister (Vince Vaughn), Franklin (Jonah Hill) and Jamarcus (The IT Crowd's Richard Ayoade) show up and volunteer to protect the neighbourhood and find Antonio's killer. Evan gets frustrated that the members of his team are using the watch as an excuse to drink and have some fun, but one night while driving they hit something, and they find it is a metallic orb, fiddling with it they find it is a powerful alien weapon that destroy anything it zaps, and meanwhile more residents of the town are being murdered, they soon realise the attacks are by aliens invading Earth. The alien they encounter warns them that they are already living amongst the people, and they theorise that they have stolen the skins of victims to wear as disguise, while Bob is concerned for his teenage daughter Chelsea (Erin Moriarty) who is with boyfriend Jason (Nicholas Braun), and Evan admits he is not spending time with his wife Abby because he is infertile which if she found out might make her leave. Bob one night ignores orders and rushes to a party his daughter is at, and he manages to prevent her from being raped by Jason, Frank helps him take the rapist down, and meanwhile Evan and Jamarcus find a suspicious neighbour, and investigating his activity find he is hosting orgies in his basement. Bob returns and argues with Evan that he must put his daughter before anything else; he quits telling him that he has no friends because of his controlling nature, and when Evan goes home he decides to admit his infertility to her, she accepts this and says that they can work things out. Jamarcus calls him urgently, confessing that he is one of the aliens, he only decided to become a real part of good humanity because he enjoys the culture, and experience a blowjob, and he warns that he knows the aliens plans to build a transmitter beneath the Costco store, this will summon the intergalactic army to attack Earth. He reveals the aliens can be killed, because their brains are located in the crotch area when disguised as humans, so Jason is killed with his penis ripped off, the metallic orb controlling the transmitter is disabled as more aliens arrive, but they use the orb to zap and destroy the aliens inside the Costco building, Earth is saved. In the end we see Evan and Abby adopt a daughter, Bob and Chelsea are closer and he accepts her boyfriend, Franklin becomes a cop for the Glenview Police Department, and Jamarcus participates in numerous orgies, the Neighbourhood Watch continues to protect the town from criminals, and aliens. Also starring Will Forte as Sgt. Bressman, Mel Rodriguez as Chucho, Hellboy's Doug Jones as Hero Alien, Erin Moriarty as Chelsea, Nicholas Braun as Jason and Full Metal Jacket's R. Lee Ermey as Manfred. Stiller, Vaughn, Hill and Ayoade add their own fun characteristics and make a funny foursome of misfits, the jokes are simple but do make you laugh a fair amount, the small moments of special effects are likable for the story, it is a little predictable in moments, but it is a fun science-fiction comedy. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch at your own risk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching the comedy "The Watch", I thought to myself that this is definitely not a training video on how to properly conduct a successful neighborhood crime watch program; it is actually its antithesis. However, I kept watching "The Watch"; first of all, because I have a cinematic golden rule that I must finish every film I start watching no matter how atrocious it is, but most of all because at the end of the day it is just a movie and not to be taken too seriously. "The Watch" stars Ben Stiller as Evan, a Costco manager who discovers that his night security guard Antonio has been murdered on the job. Evan decides to start up a Neighborhood Crime Watch program in his community to help catch Antonio's killer; which is a definite "no no" why someone should start a Neighborhood Watch program, it really should be to be the "eyes and ears" of the community and help out law enforcement, not to be a "citizens on patrol" group which is another concept altogether. Evan gets very little participation on his Neighborhood Watch participation, except for the zany Bob (Vince Vaughn) and the disturbed Franklin (Jonah Hill) who decide to join the Watch. And then we get the eccentric Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade) to round up Evan's Neighborhood Crime Watch Quartet. Bob's reason to join is to escape his home existence and bond with the guys. Franklin's goes into it more with a vigilante approach much so because of his past failed attempts to be a law enforcement officer. I will leave Jamarcus' reasoning disclosed for now, you just have to watch. In all, no Neighborhood Crime Watch employee should ever provide these guys a Crime Watch sign after they establish their phone chain. Confused? Sorry, just talking a bit Neighborhood Crime Watch protocol here, I got connections. There is plenty of silliness involved in "The Watch", especially when an alien storyline invades this movie; which was quasi-comical but mostly inane. It seemed at times that Director Avika Schaffer had a bit too many Schaefer beers while constructing "The Watch", and I think his drinking buddies were his Screenwriters Seth Rogen, Jared Stern, and Evan Goldberg. Sure their screenplay did deliver a few zingers but not enough to protect "The Watch" from LSD (Ludicrous Script Development). Stiller, Vaughn, Hill, and Ayoade should not watch out for acting awards to head their way for their performances here; even though I do think that Mr. Vaughn was really the best thespian block captain of the bunch. Sorry, wanted to deliver more Neighborhood Crime Watch terminology; again, I have connections. Also, there were not many good signs to post up on Rosemarie DeWitt's work as Evan's embryo impatient wife Abby, and of Will Forte's performance as the pestering Sgt. Bressman of the local police department. "The Watch" is not the worst comedy you will watch, and it does have its moments, but I do advise that you might be robbed of some valuable time of your personal existence. *** Average</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has a great premise, a great cast, lots of potential but is ultimately a bit of a let down.Although there are some clever ideas and some funny moments the film has a general sloppy feel about it. A lot of the scenes are very obviously ad-libbed making the dialogue quite painful at times. The story also is random. I can easily imagine some school kids writing it in their lunch break. Either that or plot components were drawn at random from a top-hat.It has most of the elements of a modern comedy. i.e most of the funny moments are in the trailer, Ben Stiller plays the same tired character he has been flogging since Something About Mary and everyone else says vagina a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A neighbourhood watch group concept is probably nothing new to the audience in Singapore, given that this scheme has some history going back into the 70s, in what would be a subset of neighbourliness, helping one another in the same block or community maintain some law and order. But of course if a comedic story is to be told based on this premise, there will be no lack of material drawn from experience in the patrols done, or even from within the group of diverse people coming together to achieve some common objectives related to safety and security.Ben Stiller reunites with Vince Vaughn since their days in Dodgeball, and you can't help but feel that their characters have been set up to reflect a very obvious rivalry. Stiller plays Evan, the neighbourhood's most connected man with his founding of various clubs from running to Spanish classes, even volunteering for a small political office, that ensures his appeal across all spectrum of the community, and in doing so, trying real hard to boost his popularity and perhaps ego. There's some truth to this especially when he feels to be of a lesser man, and needs his networks up in order to feel complete. But when a colleague dies so horribly in his supermarket, and the police is quite the inept force, he starts yet another club to address his pain and fear - the Neighborhood Watch, NW.So enter the motley crew of only three, with Vaughn playing the paranoid Bob, a paranoid, over-protective father of teenage daughter Chelsea (Erin Moriarty), Franklin (Jonah Hill) a man-child who got rejected by the police force, and Englishman Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), who is in it just so as to provide a glimmer of hope that his wildest fantasies involving Asian housewives. All of them seem to have emotional issues, with maturity way lower than their ages, so that's automatic avenue for lot's of comedy right?Well, that was the plan anyway. Director Akiva Schaffer may have a series of SNL skits under his belt, but when extrapolated into a feature film, the story by Jared Stem, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg seemed to have forgotten to put the comedy into the film. It's more of a science fiction drama by the time that the aliens make their appearance on screen, and even then their designs look like cheap knock off rejects from Alien. It's serious in tone and comedy becomes nothing but an after-thought, unless you think of Vaughn's constant trash- talking as humour - even that became boring after a while, and definitely looked very forced, as if he had to desperately dig at everything just to save the film. The best bits of comedy can all be found in the trailer, so what's left are the usual rote expectations from a team of misfits movie that deals with their team dynamics, arguments, and eventual get together to show the world, or community in this case, just what they're capable of.To think of it as Attack The Block starring older men, with less action sequences, would probably be quite apt, but even then it lacked the novelty, and the thrills, that Attack The Block had brought to the table. There are some nice touches here of course, such as the how the father-daughter relationship between Bob and Chelsea panned out, and the off key, heart to heart talk between Bob and Evan regarding the latter's condition. And how about the constant under-mining of an authoritative figure being a running thread in the film, which plays on the questioning of authority who don't make sense - quite an appeal here - and on the flip side, having the not so capable leading a bunch of free spirited volunteers spells a recipe for disaster.But everything else was rather mediocre. One would have thought that by banding a group of comedians together would automatically mean a riot of good time should they have collectively gelled their chemistry and tickle those funny bones big time, coupled with some surprises at the end. However The Watch is just that, standing around using eye power only, with little output.</fullReview>

On one hand you have this super mean alien invasion ready to kill everyone and on the other hand you have this bunch of goofs just toying around, you can't take them half seriously for a second and all in all it makes a weird mix as if you're trying to drink some coke with fresh milk, it's just wrong!

I imaged something like, the most excellent, Attack the Block. Instead I was subjected to an incredibly dull and boring 102 minutes of puerile twaddle.

		<fullReview>If you enjoy humour that only encompasses bodily fluids and sexual organs, this is the movie for you. However if your IQ is above 20 avoid this like the plague. The writers apparently wrote several smutty jokes, repeated them ad nauseam, then added a vague plot as an after thought. I thought Ben Stiller was past making this sort of rubbish given The Tower Heist, obviously I was wrong. The first half of the movie is nothing but crass humour then finally they get around to the alien then the movie becomes 1 minute of alien, 10 minutes of smut. Stupid. Pathetic. Inane. I really can't think of how to convey how utterly bad this movie is. I am embarrassed for all those involved in making this. You've been warned!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the worst movies that I have ever seen; it is better than, 'Plan 9 From Outer Space,' but that does not say much. There is a lot of talent in this movie, but was wasted. The acting is atrocious, the script unbelievably bad, and the direction non-existent. This is a movie that never knew what type movie it was supposed to be. The main problem was, in my opinion, there were 3 scriptwriters and they did not know what to write. The scriptwriters had no idea what they wrote: a comedy, a horror movie, a science fiction movie, or a social drama. If they had concentrated on one genre, they might have had a success, but I doubt it; since they did not, they had a flop. A real stinker, thankfully, there will not be a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Evan is the manager of the department store Costco and married to Abby. When night watchman Antonio is mysteriously murdered, Evan organise The Neighborhood Watch, a watch team with his suburban neighbours Bob, Franklin and Jamarcus to protect the neighbourhood and find the killer of Antonio. Soon they discover that the murderer is an alien that is preparing to invade Earth, and they become the last hope of mankind on Earth.......This is one of those movies that I had no interest in thanks to the bad press the media and critics gave it, and while it's certainly no masterpiece, its worth watching if you are a fan of Vaughn.He's easily the best thing about this, and over acts for the sake of it, making him a force to be reckoned with. He knows the film isn't brilliant, but what the hell, let's see if we can save it.Stiller looks really dis-interested, and once again proves he's way over rated. The guy hasn't made a good film since Zoolander, I would say Dodgeball is better, but again Vaughn kicks his White Goodman all over the screen.Hill and Ayoade are okay, the latter looking very embarrassed to be in this, let's hope the money he got from this will give him the ability to make another 'submarine'.There are a few funny parts, but mixing sci-fi with comedy is sometimes hard, and going for the R-rated comedy can be risky, and here it's not paid off.The final third does seem out of place, and it feels like it should be another movie.If they had made this a family friendly version, getting rid of the foul language and needless innuendo, it could have been something.Instead, it's mildly diverting, like Stillers make up.</fullReview>

If you find the use of the word "balls" to be the height of comedy then come right this way. Kind of looked like they were making the story up as they went and were trying to cover the lack of direction with extreme over acting and the desperate use of base sexual humour to distract viewers from this.To be fair the trailer pretty much says it all, just watch that and you pretty much have the whole movie bar three of the weakest jokes and one of the most nonsensical plot points.

		<fullReview>Four likable guys and fine screen actors make a meal of this loony, gross-out sci-fi comedy, but you wonder if it isn't time for them to leave behind juvenile alley. Maybe they don't think so. Anyway, the screenplay is full of penis gags (pay attention, there is a penis plot point), gross gags and bad taste gags - until we almost gag.The scenario is an excuse to overdo everything: aliens have parked their giant gizmo under the Costco in middle class Glenhaven - because it really does have everything under one roof, from power to provisions. In the dead of night they take their human targets and use the skin to hide. Nobody even bothers to remark that their physical shape is totally unlike ours and more like that bitch in Alien; hell, don't be pedantic Andrew.Evan (Ben Stiller) is the serious one who manages the Costco store and his newly Americanised Latino friend who works the security night shift has been murdered, his grisly remains splattered on the floor. An angry Evan sets up a neighbourhood watch squad - but only gets three others to join. Jonah Hill and Vince Vaughn bring their diverse and entertaining comedic bag of tricks and Richard Aoyade is a standout as the bespectacled Englishman with a secret, whose quietly spoken manner is also a comedic tool.In the meantime, Evan and his wife (Rosemarie DeWitt, lovely) continue to try making a baby, but there is a reason why they can't which provides the film's one attempt at a serious message - about talking problems through with your partner. Well done, since the target market probably needs to hear that.Message delivered, it's back to slapstick and schtick. They say youth is wasted on the young; well in this case, talent is wasted on the movieBut it all sounds funnier than it is. Much of the film is a yawn a minute with plenty of low-points with most of the humour failing the joke-metre. The young male target market will probably enjoy it, though, together with mates and a beer or two or three.</fullReview>

I liked the cast for this film: Ben Stiller, Jonah Hill and Vince Vaughn were brilliant options for a film. They are all comedy stars but there is one major issue with the film. Its the scriptThe script wasn't really too funny and that just causes those great actors to have nothing to work with. It could've easily been compared to '21 Jump Street' and 'Ted' for the year as the funniest films, but unlike in the other two films, the script in this one was pretty poor. ****SPOILERS****There were a couple of funny moments such as shooting the dicks of those aliens. I loved how Jamarcus was shown to be an alien and how he seemed innocent. I loved the way they brought him back. The ending fight where Evan blows up his shop was great. ***end of spoilers***Apart from that, its an alright film with a great cast and not too much humor. Disappointing</fullReview>

For the most part the film was very annoying, at more than one occasion I was almost praying for the aliens to eat Ben Stiller as he was the most annoying and aside from him the other three characters played by Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and Richard Ayoade were morons and neither one of them were particularly likable.The only actor who was remotely funny was R. Lee Ermey who seem to have been given the best lines in the whole movie but unfortunately he only makes a brief appearance.As far as the plot goes, its pretty badly put together because the trailer clearly suggested this would be four dimwit neighborhood watch guys taking on aliens. Instead it turned out to be a non-funny comedy that was just annoying and didn't deliver on what I expected after seeing the trailer.All in all, this film is a waste of time, if I had a choice between this and the array of sitcoms on TV I'd go for the sitcoms.</fullReview>

Many of my doubts about the awkward pairing of buddy movie and serious alien invasion were certainly justified, but to my surprise the experience was overall fairly enjoyable.Okay the plot makes very little sense and the characters behaviour makes even less but ultimately any film which stars such a bizarre ensemble cast is never going to win any awards for realism. The main problem is there are just too many story elements and protagonists to tell a cohesive tale. Richard Ayoade seemingly plays Moss from I.T crowd and none of his colleagues have either the screen time or the material to produce anything close to original. What transpires though could certainly have been a lot more cringe worthy and despite my best efforts I managed a short sexy laugh at more than one scene. Don't be scared to give it a try as long as you don't intend to think whilst you watch "the watch."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Short on inspiration, short on laughs. Short on everything but foul language.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Watch is a lackluster comedy that clearly draws its inspiration from Ghostbusters. As with that great comedy, four average guys band together only to find themselves in the midst of the build-up to an other-worldly apocalypse. On the inspiration scale, the movie comes up way too light. On the laugh scale it actually inches closer to Ghostbusters 2. That's not a good thing.What we have here is a sloppy comedy with few laughs featuring a bunch of average joes that, in another movie, we may have come to like. The problem is that it can't decide what kind of movie it wants to be. On one hand is a movie about an alien invasion. On the other hand it is a movie about four guys suffering various domestic issues. To our dismay, the movie tries to find equal time for both.Ben Stiller leads the pack as Evan, a straight-arrow guy who loves his job as the manager of the local Costco and is dismayed by the information that his newly hired security guard was murdered inside the store ? skinned, in fact ? on his first night on the job. From this, Evan forms a neighborhood watch with the hope of keeping his town safe and hopefully catching the killer. Despite his announcement of the new neighborhood watch at the local football game, he draws only three potential recruits. One is Bob (Vince Vaughn), a nice guy who is having a problem dealing with his daughter's budding sexuality. Another is Franklin (Jonah Hill), an angry kid who was denied a place on the police force. Then there's Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a clean-cut Brit whose fondest wish in life (which can't be printed here) brings a stunned silence to the group.On patrol, Evan squashes something with his car that clearly had tentacles. Among the remains is a round silver object that turns out to be an alien weapon that can evaporate its target. As they dig deeper into the mystery they uncover a plot by the aliens to destroy our world, which is about it in terms of the alien invasion. What happens in the end really brings neither surprises nor comic zeal. It is all just closure with lots of special effects and explosions. The aliens themselves are your standard movie monsters, all slime, yellow eyes, teeth and tentacles. Their purpose for being here? To destroy our planet, just like every other alien in the movies. Ho-hum.What becomes clear is that the alien invasion plot was so thin that the screenwriters (one of whom is Seth Rogan) felt the need to add an uncomfortable series of domestic issues. Evan and his wife Abby (Rosemary DeWitt) are trying to have a baby while Evan is wrestling with how to break the new that he is shooting blanks. Meanwhile, Bob is dealing with his unmanageable teenage daughter whose new boyfriend he has spotted at Costco buying large quantities of condoms. Interesting stuff, but they feel odd in a plot in which an alien invasion is lurking elsewhere.It wouldn't matter anyway. Those issues are so earthbound and mishandled that they feel uncomfortable on their own. So too does the presence of a surprising amount of crude, foul language. Most of the dialogue between the guys is of an explicit sexual nature aimed mostly at their own reproductive organs. They don't really seem interested in women at all; they just make jokes about their own nether-regions and each others. This happens early and often. So often, in fact, that it makes up much of the movie's dialogue and even those who usually find this stuff funny may find it tiresome. The rest of the dialogue deals with issues of personal responsibility and the importance of friendship. That's all nice and good, but it isn't really what an audience will be attending this movie for in the first place. We're bored when we should be laughing. It's pretty bad when you attend a comedy and the biggest laugh takes place in the trailer that precedes it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Raunchy Alien Invasion Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last summer saw the release of Jon Favreau's "Cowboys &amp; Aliens," a film that quite inexplicably found the right balance between a science fiction alien invasion thriller and a western, two disparate genres if ever there were any. Now we have "The Watch," in which a hostile alien takeover has been paired with a raunchy buddy comedy. This time around, something went horribly wrong. The genres don't mesh. Perhaps they could have in the hands of a more focused creative team; director Akiva Schaffer and writers Jared Stern, Seth Rogen, and Evan Goldberg aren't interested in finding a balance so much as they are in being as crude as possible. As a result, they never seem to know what they want their film to be. This is a confused film that spends less time on the aliens and more time on straining merely halfway funny jokes to the point of unendurable monotony.Taking place in a suburban Ohio town, the film's main character is Evan Trautwig (Ben Stiller), the manager of a Costco Wholesale store. More than a little politically correct, he prides himself on knowing and respecting people of various ethnic backgrounds, from his Hispanic nighttime security guard to his Korean neighbor, who's always washing her car. He doesn't yet know any black people, he tells us during his opening voice-over narration, but he's eager to work towards that goal. He's an active member of his community, having formed and micromanaged numerous clubs and organizations. He takes his volunteer work quite seriously, but as one shot in a community center makes perfectly clear, not too many people are inspired by his enthusiasm. I would wager to guess that most of the people he knows are laughing at him behind his back, and that if he were to find out about it, he would never stop crying.When the aforementioned security guard is found skinned alive inside Costco, Evan channels his grief into the formation of a neighborhood watch. With any luck, the killer will be tracked down and brought to justice. Ultimately, only three people join Evan in his crusade, except they don't see it as a crusade so much as an excuse to act like fratboys on a bender. There's Bob Finnerty (Vince Vaughn), and despite the fact that he's a loud and crude bachelor type, he's also the father of a teenage girl, and he's desperate to protect her from the evils of boys. There's Franklin (Jonah Hill), who has had emotional problems after dropping out of high school and flunking the test to join the local police. He brandishes a switchblade and has a stash of guns under his bed. He also lives with his mother. Finally, there's Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), who comes off as a cross between a horny pervert and a computer nerd.Although Evan is sincere in his efforts to get to the bottom of the murder, the other three really just want to goof off. How lucky that they all just happened to stumble onto a basketball-sized metal sphere, which shoots a laser capable of blowing things up. This eventually leads to another lucky discovery, namely that of an insectoid alien creature with green goo for blood. They don't know what it's here, but after a night of posing its supposedly dead body in the most immature of ways, they learn that it is but one of many creatures that already walks among them. They become paranoid. Who in their community is an alien in disguise? Evan has reason to believe that his neighbor, played by an uncredited Billy Crudup, might be one of them. He's a creepy, lecherous man who makes blatantly homoerotic advances on Evan, and eventually on Jamarcus.Several ill-fitting subplots work their way into this narrative, begging the question of who really had control over the screenplay, if anyone at all. One involves Evan's wife, Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt), and their lack of success at having a baby. Another involves Bob spying on his daughter at a friend's party, where she meets up with a boy eager to speed things along. There's nothing innately funny about either scenario, and indeed, there are moments when the filmmakers come within a hair's breadth of taking them seriously. This is the wrong approach. You cannot believably take a dramatic turn when the dialogue is littered with obscene sexual references and vulgar jokes that are permitted to continue long after they have stopped being funny.There's really no need for me to bring this up, but it's now well known that the original title of the film was "Neighborhood Watch" and that the first official ad campaign was pulled following the controversial shooting death of Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman. Can we all agree that the film would have been just as bad even if the shooting had never happened? In order for "The Watch" to have worked, someone somewhere along the way needed to determine what direction to take the story in and then stay on that path. There's nothing to be gained by mashing up incongruous genres just for the sake of mashing. One must find a way to get them to work in harmony. That balance wasn't found. All we have here is a waste of talent, money, and time. It's not as if you'll be getting those 100 minutes of your life back.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The nerve! I can't believe it look better on the page. Ben Stiller should know better by now. Or it's just a question of money. Not a moment of real comedy, not one. Vince Vaughn totally out of control in a non-character part. Oscar nominee Jonah Hill, lost. I felt hopeful when Billy Crudup makes his appearance, but the hope was very short lived. Random, inexplicable touches, that include explosions as a form of production value,I presume, but how embarrassing. The script is cheap and opportunistic but also misses its target, completely. Aliens in suburbia could have been a great idea. They needed writers and a director to execute it with some degree of oomph. Awful and depressing.</fullReview>

Ah but then there's Vince Vaughn the fast talking man-child that he is...that's ALWAYS a funny role ain't it? Yeah, not so much...not so much. This is a steaming pile of cult of personality. Nothing more. The jokes are sterile. The deliveries are dialed in...from loooong distance. Everyone is sleep walking or aping themselves from past movies. So, in a sense it's a body snatcher movie. You've seen this before. Uninspired, unfunny, and unoriginal. Yes...there are people that enjoyed it fool! There are people that enjoy Beiber, Spears, and That's My Boy....this...is for them.

		<fullReview>Seth Gordon stages a sardonic view of "crime" and "criminals', using the ambivalent roles of a characters destined to be "criminals" to end up as "victims", and of a victim that becomes a murderer. Seth Gordon underscore once more the difficulties in separating reality from fiction, and the ambivalence involved in human nature and values. The mockery that Seth Gordon makes of the psycoanalitic club childish efforts in disecting the crime dynamics through which they could find a "cure" for criminal impulses reaches further and is a mirror (like the ones he often uses through the film) that he places in front of the viewers to reveal the often brutish efforts that we engage trying to explain our world. Just watch this movie at your own risk, and probably you will find something in it that even Seth Gordon did not think about.Perhaps we were just not in the mood, but it soon became so pointless, that even the presence of our favorite 'tards could not help us finish this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Watch (2012) - Got Protection?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If a lot of you already know, "The Watch" was originally given the title, "Neighborhood Watch", but then the title was changed due to a controversy involving the shooting of Trayvon Martin by a member of a neighborhood watch group. Now, although I was really looking forward to see this movie, and although this movie's Rotten Tomatoes rating of 15% is quite not agreeable, "The Watch", although at it's consistent funny moments, isn't that perfect or quite memorable for an R-rated comedy. With an all-star cast, Ben Stiller delivers the same, usual, and uninspired performance as Evan, he's a kind and "by-the-book" nerd, working as a general manager for a local Costco, who then forms a neighborhood watch after his friend was murdered. He teams up Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill, and Richard Ayoyade to help keep the neighborhood safe?or it's just a lame excuse to hang out with the guys! But then, an alien invasion starts to appear out of nowhere, and now it's up to the watch to keep everyone safe. Now, "The Watch" is not a terrible movie like everyone says it is, but it is a disappointing comedy that shares a few consistent laughs throughout. Even with a cool soundtrack and a likable cast, "The Watch" sadly doesn't live up to the hype for me! But, there are a few consistent moments, almost throughout the movie, that were undeniably funny, while some other moments either made me chuckle or cringe. Some members of the cast have their funny moments, especially Richard Ayoyade's scene-stealing performance. But overall, this movie just didn't quite impress me, and I really didn't get into the comedy in this one. As for the cast, each and every character is completely stereotypical, from Vaughn's man-child overprotective father, Hill's bad-ass speaking mamma's boy, Ayoyade's comic relief dude with a funny accent, and Stiller's awkward man with relationship problems involving having children. The plot holes are completely excruciating, the dialogue is badly forced, the pacing is a little too quick, the amount of "f-bombs" are considered unnecessary, and the whole alien subplot is a little too goofy. There's also a lot of predictable clichs from here and there, the action scenes are tensionless, and Will Forte delivers one of the most annoying performances in the history of film, as a bumbling cop against the watch. Everything was just all over the place, nothing really went appropriately planned here. Although "The Watch" is a disappointing paper-thin gimmick, it's still pretty entertaining for the most part, and again, I laughed at a couple of parts. But overall, "The Watch" is a forgettable and disappointing movie that still has it's moments. "The Watch", in my review, "occasionally funny, but sadly unimpressive".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alien invasion ideas are still far from over. But trying to mix comedy with science fiction doesn't seem like a good idea to me, so long the funny parts are taking the lead. It didn't work well with "Paul" and certainly didn't do the trick this time. "The Watch" is an incredibly boring adventure. There were moments when I wished fervently it would turn away from the attempted failed jokes to a more serious take on the sci-fi direction as the special effects involving the creature are quite good. Unfortunately that does not happen and getting to the end is quite a painful wait. The aliens are okay and the only one needing protection in this case is your pocket. Bad choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Funny. Raunchy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a COSTCO employee is murdered, a neighborhood watch is formed. What will they do when they discover the murderer is an alien who wants to destroy earth?Yes, it was only a matter of time before our "almost comedians" discovered a story with an alien in it. Here it is. And, now we know that comedy is dead and Raunch has replaced it. Pity us.This will be my last venture watching "comedy" films with Vince Vaughn, and Jonah Hill. Yes, I know they will be disappointed all the way to the bank. And, so it goes. I will admit there wasn't as much raunch as I expected from these "comedians", but nevertheless it's still there. I did notice that Ben Stiller doesn't do the potty-mouth like Vaughn and Hill relish doing. So I will give Ben Stiller another look-see in the future If Stiller would pick non-raunchy scripts, he may come close to being the good comedian his father (Jerry Stiller) is. The raunch aside, the script and the acting suffered greatly until the murderer alien was identified. After that it settled down to getting the alien and heading off the alien invasion. But, still there was nothing funny in here. Isn't a comedy supposed to be funny? (1/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Sexual innuendo: Loaded. Language: Yes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four letter words obscure wit, direction, writing, etc</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Watch is one of those comedies that seems to rely too heavily on its cast's abilities and believes it can phone-in other key parts of filmmaking such as writing, tone, direction, and wit. When we laugh during the film, are we laughing because the scenarios are funny or because these are actors we've all seen in funny movies? Combing three of the funniest and most reliable actors working today, and one British actor who already has a loyal fanbase in America, seems like an easy recipe for success, but the recipe begins to call for too much and offer too little quickly.The film was originally titled "Neighborhood Watch," but was quickly changed because of looming controversy from the Trayvon Martin case. You won't be thinking about that at all because the film offers so little resemblance to any "neighborhood watch" movie, program, or event in the last decade or so. It concerns Evan Trautwig (Stiller), a Costco manager and a loyal community activist, who has been starting clubs left and right for his humble Glenview, Ohio neighborhood. After one of his workers is murdered in the Costco, Evan creates a neighborhood watch program, which only recruits three misfits; loudmouth Bob (Vaughn), unstable Franklin (Hill), and offbeat Jamarcus (Ayoade).As the watch works in a rather disorganized manner, they soon discover that the town is home to rather unearthly creatures and, obviously, since the police won't believe them, they must take matters into their own hands.Ben Stiller gives his umpteenth rendition of the good-guy trying to do right, Vince Vaughn is a loud, obnoxious fratboy, who is struggling to maintain control as a single father looking after his rebellious teen daughter, and Jonah Hill is rather off-putting as an rejected police officer, mama's boy who continues to have trouble emoting and controlling his anger. While they are all playing stale archetypes of characters they have done in the past, they do manage to squeeze some laughs and chuckles here and there. But the king here is easily Richard Ayoade, who is sadly getting the cold shoulder with the film's ad campaign, which is boasting "STILLER, VAUGHN, AND HILL." Ayoade stars on a British sitcom called The IT Crowd, and has picked up followers in the U.S happily. Here, he delivers some memorable one-liners, as he sometimes effortlessly one-ups the other comedy veterans at their game.What leaves The Watch with a pungent aftertaste is the writing, which to begin with, is not very funny, but is brought to the "decent" category because we see funny actors performing what is on the paper. The film was written by Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and Jared Stern, and seeing as both Rogen and Goldberg were the ones responsible for making Superbad's script so quick, witty, and hilarious, it is surprising to see The Watch flounder in the writing department. This is where the film becomes too reliant on its actors, as it neglects to give them some interesting dialog to bounce off of.It is also apparent that the direction is obscured because of the screenplay continuously jumping into raunchy comedy, sci-fi elements, romanticism between Evan and his wife, drama between Bob and his daughter, etc. One moment, we are laughing tirelessly at R. Lee Ermey's over-the-top cameo and the next, we are rolling our eyes when the boys are being attacked in Bob's mancave by another life-form. Had the film been more consistent in its writing, I doubt this problem would've even been so noticeable.Director Akiva Schaffer, one of the three members of The Lonely Island comedy troupe (the three make a cameo in the film) responsible for some seriously witty music videos and digital shorts on Saturday Night Live, definitely has passion for the weird and surreal, with his previous effort being the unsung cult classic Hot Rod. He simply does what he can with what he has, while The Watch scurries along in its screenplay of errors and its directions a plenty Starring: Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill, Richard Ayoade, Will Forte, and R. Lee Ermey. Directed by: Akiva Schaffer.</fullReview>

When the Costco night watchman Antonio Guzman (Joe Nunez) is mysteriously murdered, Evan organizes The Neighborhood Watch, a watch team with his suburban neighbors Bob (Vince Vaughn), Franklin (Jonah Hill) and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade) to protect the neighborhood and find the killer of Antonio. Soon they discover that the murderer is an alien that is preparing to invade Earth, and they become the last hope of mankind on Earth."The Watch" is a gross, silly and unfunny comedy with Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn. There are very few funny moments along 102 minutes running time and in the end, this movie is very disappointing.

		<shortDescription>I wouldn't "watch" it again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it has the flavor and script pattern of Ghostbusters, The Watch is so far from a classic that it might serve as the definitive model for boy-men comedies that don't get comedy. Four suburban, beer-swilling stiffs discover an alien invasion and attempt to thwart it.Led by Costco manager Evan (Ben Stiller), the Neighborhood Watch team looks more like low-rent Keystone Cops than a parody of contemporary masculinity: Evan is a tightly-wound, blank shooting (as in sperm) husband of a sexually-frustrated, but loving wife (Rosemary DeWitt): Franklin (Jonah Hill) is a wired cop wannabe, Bob (Vince Vaughan) is an overly-protective dad, who, like most Vaughan characters, just wants to have fun; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade) is a likable Brit with a big secret, who doesn't always make sense.Most of the setups, such as a foul-mouthed curmudgeon neighbor with a shotgun and the teen-age orgy, are by now clich's of slasher films and derivative teen comedies, and in this film fall flat. Although Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg of Superbad and Pineapple Express should have made a difference in helping head writer Jared Stern, very little worked, a wasteland of male bonding with no wit. Give the writers credit, though, for weaving a male potency motif that extends from Evan's inadequacy through the green alien slime that tastes and smells like sperm to where most effectively to dispatch the aliens. In fact, the phallus is the defining object determining success or failure in this surface world of male fantasy.Having just watched the exceptionally funny Intouchables from France, I can say I do laugh at films, but only ones with witty dialogue and premises with some heft.The Watch was originally going to be called "Neighborhood Watch" until the vigilante in Florida killed a teenager caused a national stir, so the film seems emasculated by contrast with reality and so hyper-sexualized as to be not even sexy. I wouldn't "watch" it if I were you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Another Foul-Mouth Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A funny thing happened on the way while watching the movie The Watch. It became so idiotic, so silly, that it became funny. Up to about halfway through I was bored enough to think about just leaving. Nothing but another foul-mouth, dirty talk film, but I stuck it out and darned if the movie didn't finally get me laughing. I still ask, aren't there any screenplay writers out there capable of writing anything but foul language? Is that the skill level now? If so, everyone out of the pool?.no, I mean, everyone gets fired and they start all over with some fresh talent in Hollywood. Even when there is a bit of a plot, an idea to develop, it all seems to hinge on each and every actor speaking as filthy as possible, calling it a movie, wrapping it up and sending it out to the public?.that same public, I guess, with standards set so low as to accept this stuff as worthy of spending money on.So I am left wondering...is there no one to actually look at this stuff before it's finished? Nobody capable of stepping back and saying, "Hey, I think we might have something here, but let's clean it up and put some creativity into producing something the audience will be happy to sit through." I suppose, once upon a time, a long, long time ago, foul language was a shocker and if nothing else, the writers, directors, producers could go for the shock value. Not so much anymore. How about digging a little deeper and coming up with actual creativity? Too much to ask? I don't think so. Why not give it a try? In this case, as I said earlier, it got so downright stupid-silly as to end up being amusing?. plus there was a bit of a twist there to spice it up. But come on?..give us real dialog, even if it means someone has to strain to produce it. We deserve it. We're the movie-loving public. The people who like to go to the theater and then buy the movie when it comes out in DVD. Only we don't these days....'cause there is precious little to either want to see or certainly not to own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stiller, Vaughn, and Hill...What Could Go Wrong? Oh Wait, Everything!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When was the last time Ben Stiller was actually in a good movie? When was the last time Vince Vaughn was in a good movie? I don't remember because they were never very good. Jonah Hill has been in some great films in the last few years; Moneyball, 21 Jump Street, but has also been in some really bad films; The Sitter was the latest example. Unfortunately, he's not doing well here either. The Watch is another example of a film that sacrifices jokes and good performances for gross-out humor, and it's not very funny. Just like That's My Boy.The film starts off with Ben Stiller's character, who forms a bunch of clubs because he has no friends. He then starts the Neighborhood Watch (the original title of this film), to try and find aliens that might live in the neighborhood. Vaughn and Hill are two of the new members, and they both have their share of problems. I won't spoil anything else for you, but this is a raunchy, unfunny, gross film that almost treats the audience like idiots. I can't tell whether or not this is worse than That's My Boy, but it comes pretty close. This is easily, one of the worst films of the year. Do yourselves a favor, and don't see this, but considering the fact the film hasn't done well at the box office, you probably haven't seen it. Good for you!Final Verdict: 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't often take time to review movies however I want save save anyone thinking of seeing this movie there money. The story line was boring. While I didn't think it was going to be a great story I thought the likes of Stiller, Hill, and Vaughn would make up for the plot and they would take the movie to a new level. They did not. Vince Vaughn had a few funny moments he is personally funny for me no matter what. The storyline seemed forced and the acting didn't make up for it.Overall terrible story and not funny a huge disappointment for the star studded cast. The theatre was silent throughout a couple in front of me booed at the end.While it wasn't the worse movie I've seen this year it was far from the best</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neighborhood Watch Meets Alien... A Riot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while there is a movie that is so off the wall it works. It's usually a sleeper... not much ad run or much fanfare but it just has some "it" factor. The Watch was like that for me.Without a doubt the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. Stiller, Vaughn, Hill, and Ayoade???? Which one of these is not like the others? I like Stiller in some movies. He's usually the straight man as he was in this flick. Vaughn, I just don't like. He's way to annoying. Hill is pretty solid. I wouldn't rely on him to carry a movie, but he's sound. And Ayoade... who? The movie was very funny. I actually had no clue what it was about going in so it was all a surprise. Once I saw Vince Vaughn I started my internal countdown to when I would turn the movie off, but to my delight I never did.Who does a movie about a neighborhood watch organization and aliens? No one!! This movie was a huge risk and Costco sure got some run out of it. The movie was silly, it was spastic but it was funny and fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Watch is a strange one!At first, it seems to be striving hard for laughs. Its slow, and almost loses you in the first ten minutes which isn't good.But then you start to catch on as to how this should be viewed, and there is quite an endless amount of actual laugh-out-loud moments that pulls you back in.Even British comedian Richard Ayoade, of whom I am a huge fan, seems slightly out of place given the foul mouthed script from comedy drug king Seth Rogen, but still gives plenty of laughs and surprises throughout.That said, it comes across quite serious at times which can trick you after such laughs.Not what I was expecting at all, but still very enjoyable!Give it a watch...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course this is a bad movie, predictable and kind of stupid, plus they kill the only non-white (except for Jamarcus I guess) character at the start of the movie but what can I really say regarding how I feel about it? it's funny and entertaining. I think what makes it so much is that all of the four main guys are so useless that you're worried about their lives yet you think they kinda deserve to be hurt because they're damn idiots like that. Pretty good movie for a cross between sci-fi and comedy I feel. As I said though, it's pretty predictable. Even one of them being an alien I could predict. At parts it was a bit cheesy but in a light-hearted way. One of those movies so bad they're good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the greatest comedy, but a good sci-fi film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WATCH I saw the trailer for this a few years ago and it never really appealed to me, but after seeing it I wished I watched earlier.The movie is about a group of friendless guys who decide to put together a neighbourhood watch group after a shop security guard gets murdered and skinned. They soon realise that this group they have made is investigating something even more surreal than a murder.The film comes across as a comedy, but to be honest it wasn't that funny. OK, so I laughed in places, but in general I thought it could have been funnier. I would consider this to be more of a sci-fi film that anything else. It was a very good movie though. It was just misleading.The story is fun and the aliens looked amazing. They were like a mix of Alien and Predator together. The effects were really good and the alien looked realistic enough. There was a really funny scene where they thought they killed one of the aliens and they were just taking photos with it.The movie stars Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and Richard Ayoade. Ben was really good in this, but then he is quite good in a lot of his movies. Vince was really funny throughout too, but the thing with him is he seems to play the same character in every movie he plays. I don't think he has any range to try anything different. Jonah played his part well and was possible the funniest character in the movie because he played it so seriously. Richard was brilliant. His English accent really made his character all the funnier. He had some great lines, but I had hoped he would have had a bigger speaking part.The film ran along nicely. I didn't get bored at all and it felt like it passed quite quickly. All in all I though this film was a lot of fun and I am glad I watched it. It is a good movie, just not as funny as I had hoped.I will give this film 7 out of 10."I have this one scenario in my mind. I kinda hope it plays out like this: young, sexy, Asian housewife, alone at night, frightened. A noise out by the trash cans. Best call the neighbourhood watch. I show up, look heroic, and then... get this - she sucks my balls."

		<shortDescription>Rushed comedy and recycled material.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In comedy films your going to laugh at things you haven't heard of. In 'The Watch' you have big comedians like Ben Stiller, Jonah Hill, and Vince Vaughn who live in a small town that start a neighborhood watch team to protect against aliens. Not a single moment in this film besides Jonah Hill giving a couple funny one-liners is funny, and the comedy is so recycled. The language used, the scenes with aliens, and the disasters are rushed and rotated for a while that make you want to scream. Comedies these days need originality in order to please an audience. Not a single moment in 'The Watch' will make you bored and unhappy with it's lame comedic effect, and overall status of being another bad comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a laugh or two and don't care about a plot watch, "The Watch." The acting is pretty good, but the writing is horrible. So, If you feel a storyline is one big waste of time, watch, "The Watch." This is one of those flicks that should have gone directly to DVD? Now that is not to say there is no audience out there. There is of course and they are cut from the same feeble-minded tribe who devoured Leni Riefenstahl productions in the early 20th century. The script seemed to be a mindless jumble of words pointlessly scribbled blindly in search of a laugh. Gain, the cast is superb, but the production is horrible. One forgettable story supported by a superb cast of Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Jonah Hill and Richard Ayoade, is beyond saving. I can bravely say, I didn't leave the theater early, But honestly should have. I will admit, I did laugh some, so it was not the worst and that is what told me this was a comedy. I was at a crossroads as to what kind of grade to give this thing. There is no 'zero' and I do like the cast. How about a 2?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are only a few moments in The Watch that you'll wanna "watch"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it with Vince Vaughn? He's like a big kid actor that won't grow up. The dude is like 40 and he appears in films in which his character could probably be played by someone in their teens or early twenties. He was in Swingers (1996), arguably one of the freshest most original indie comedies of the 90's. Now, he's become a victim of his own doing. I now call his movies "Vince Vaughn Movies". These are movies where he acts well, like Vince Vaughn. With his rambling and improvisational overdose style of delivering lines, he's starting to wear on me as a moviegoer. Oh, and don't get me started with the titles of his movies (I'm sure it's not his fault). We have The Break Up (2006), The Dilemma (2011), The Internship (2013), and The Delivery Man (2013). Ouch!Let's add another "the" to the mix with The Watch (2012). It's one of those R rated movies that's rated R for the sake of being rated R. You could easily of had this thing be a PG or PG-13 flick. But why not throw in some unnecessary bad language and gross out humor for the heck of it (all the studios seem bent on putting movies out like this). Anyway, The Watch tells the story of four residents of a small Ohio town who come together for a common purpose. They decide to form a neighborhood watch group to stop what they believe to be alien forces inhabiting the area. The four main characters are played by Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Jonah Hill, and Richard Ayoade. I don't know much about Ayoade as an actor, but he's got the right idea. He's trying to play an actual character (maybe it's because it's only his 7th movie). Aside from him though, everyone else seems to be playing themselves. Ben Stiller is acting like well, Ben Stiller and the same thing goes for Jonah Hill. What the heck!? Can't these guys just emote a little? And the worst one of all is Vaughn. I kinda miss him playing a bad guy like in Domestic Disturbance (2001) (jeez I never thought I'd say that). Sad to say, he's become a parody of himself in the worst way.As for the movie, I chuckled a bit. I mean, it had that "so stupid it's funny" thing down to a T. There's a little entertainment value there and that's why I gave it a ** Star rating. I liked a couple of subplots involving Stiller's character's estranged wife and their relationship. The same goes for Vaughn's character and his daughter. It seems like this is stuff from a better movie that got thrown into this one. But what's on screen for the full 102 minutes is the end result. The Watch is a disposable summer flick that might as well not have been made. The plot may hold up as a cartoon or a teen movie of the week, but as a Hollywood production it holds no weight whatsoever. Vince Vaughn, you were money, but now your just Chapter 11 and you didn't even know it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge potential, full of disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I originally saw the trailer for The Watch, I pictured it to be an example of raw comedy. Vaughn, Stiller, Hill and Ayoade all come packed with potential from previous success stories, therefore you'd have expected them to have made a half decent job of this. Wrong. The movie contains the occasional one liner which creates the odd laugh, but there was no 'real' comedy within the plot or the script. As much as I thought I would have enjoyed this, I'm afraid it was one of the biggest disappointments of 2012. Throughout the movie the pace tends to slow down and drag on, not made easier with the lack of comedy! The execution of The Watch was a disaster which could have been made 10x better if the audience didn't get the sense that the actors were just trying to finish the movie and move on. As independents they usually generate a highly successful and funny story. But I'm afraid, not this time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fist words that come to mind when I try to describe this flick are, "I didn't hate it, but...". Now, I know that's not a glowing recommendation, but don't take it as a glowing bio-hazard warning sign just yet."The Watch" definitely has it's downfalls. The characters are very bland (I particularly disliked 'That-Guy-From-The-IT-Crowd' Richard Ayoade). The story holds up as well as a matchstick house, and the humour is, bluntly, sophomoric.It's not all negative though. Other than Ayoade, I thought the casting was spot-on. Jonah Hill played his part very well and had me laughing with a few of his lines. Another positive is that the CGI, although there isn't a lot of it, looks great. The aliens look like an organic creature and interact with the cast really well.All in all, "The Watch" just doesn't matter. There's a few good quips here and there but for the most-part it's an annoying, generic Ben Stiller movie. It's not surprising that this movie only raked in half of it's estimated budget. If you choose to watch this one, do so with an open-mind, otherwise you'll hate it. If you decide to give it a miss though, you're not missing a whole lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of the end of frat pack comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By its very nature, a comedy is meant to be funny. This is made possible by either using clever and well placed wit, or slapstick gags, or a combination of both. Supposedly intended as a comedy, THE WATCH is fundamentally deficient in any and all aspects that are essential to its conception, less so it's making. Instead, what we have here is a blatant and utter disregard for the genre, made worse by the overuse of one, just one tasteless gag- the ode to a phallus.The story begins with the introduction of Evan Trautwig (Ben Stiller), a manager at the local Costco department store and an active civic member of the township of Glenview, Ohio. After the gruesome murder of the store's security guard, and the indifference shown by the local police in solving the crime, Evan decides to apprehend the culprit by initiating a Neighborhood Watch unit. Following a somewhat embarrassing public speech, Evan is left with no choice but to recruit the only three people who respond to his call for vigilance. With less than appealing introductions, they are Bob (Vince Vaughn) a family man who needs an excuse to party, Franklin (Jonah Hill) a wannabe cop who has failed to qualify on all counts, and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade) a Brit with the kinks for Asian housewives. When more townsfolk start to disappear, Evan and his three stooges discover the presence of an extraterrestrial life form &#x336; a green blooded hostile alien lurking in human form, with intent on annihilating the planet (no less).Anyone reading that synopsis could easily mistake this for a contemporary sci-fi movie. THE WATCH is much more; Try Horror, whodunit murder-mystery, drama, action and a slight case of comedy, all in that order. Considering the combined comic potential of Stiller, Vaughn, Hill and Ayoade, you would expect this to be a laugh out riot. Somehow it just doesn't gel. The film's second biggest failure is the fact that this frat pack formula doesn't seem to work. If anything, it appears overdone. Vaughn plays his favorite character - a protective family man who craves buddy time with just the guys. Stiller is in his comfort zone as the only character caught between doing what he has to do and what he wants to do. Ayoade's performance feels like a Stand-up act; it's got Saturday NIGHT LIVE written all over. Hill is the most disappointing of the lot and goes from his Oscar nominated fervor in MONEYBALL all the way back to his lanky weirdo in PINEAPPLE EXPRESS and SUPERBAD. Speaking of which brings me to the film's biggest problem- Seth Rogen's hand in co-scripting this outdated and outrageous story (just a year later, Rogen and gang would do it all over again in THIS IS THE END). Everything from the dialogue to the action feels carbon-copied for Hill, Vaughn and Stiller. They just do and say what they have done and said in previous films. Only this time, profanity is at an all-time high with umpteen references to the male reproductive system. How does this relate to saving the planet from an alien invasion? Believe it or not, it does in the ludicrous manner in which they save the day.Director Akiva Schaffer, in context the proverbial lamb to the slaughter, does not seem to have had a snowball's chance in hell in putting this very unfunny comedy together. As the director, what are the odds of a successful comedy when the premise is about a small town with no one but four idiots who band together to stop an alien invasion? To find out, I dare say give it a try. If you do, I dare you to watch THE WATCH without looking at your watch.</fullReview>

As the movie progress, they find the neighborhood is being infiltrated by space aliens.My main problem with this movie is the lack of likability in all the characters. As funny as they can be, likability is still important for the jokes to work. It's safe to say my feelings for Vince Vaughn bordered on pure hatred.

What I could have done without was all the cursing, trying to be adult humor rather than just being funny. In the movie, Ben Stiller plays Evan, a rather boring husband and manager of the local Costco. One night, his night guard is killed and he decides to form a neighborhood watch. 3 other guys decide to join and all are goofy. They catch some teens egging, which was funny. Then they find the dead old, mean guy and discover an alien in his yard. They learn aliens may be among them and get invited to a swinger's party. Then they learn the part Costco plays in it all.FINAL VERDICT: A silly humorous movie filled with juvenile jokes. If you like any of the actors, it's worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How much do you love your community? Would you join every civic organization whose goals you support and start your own, if necessary? Would you risk your life defending it?Evan Trautwig (played by Ben Stiller) is the most civic-minded member of his hometown of Glenview, OH. As a member of most local community organizations and founder of several, Evan (Stiller) somehow manages to balance all that, a wife, and a job managing the local Costco. When the night watchman, his friend, is murdered, he then starts the one community organization that his town surprisingly does not have: a neighborhood watch. Despite posting signs all over Glenview to alert the citizenry of their first meeting, only three men show up. Bob Finnerty, father and construction worker, Franklin, who had hoped to join the police but was rejected, and Jamarcus who is recently divorced. Finnerty (played by Vince Vaughn) shows no interest in safeguarding the community and uses the watch as an excuse to get out of the house. Franklin (played by Jonah Hill) sees the watch as an opportunity to show up those on the police force who rejected him and engage in acts of vigilantism. Jamarcus (played by Richard Ayoade) is simply looking to meet people while entertaining the possibility that a lonely, attractive, housewife might call the watch for assistance and seduce him. Whatever their differences, they're all shocked when they discover the violent attack that inspired Trautwig to found the watch was perpetrated by aliens.I've said it before; I'm not a fan of Ben Stiller. Almost all of his movies are exactly the same. That's only become clearer since he decided the Meet the Parents franchise needed a third, even more ridiculous, installment. As for Vince Vaughn, I've liked some of his work. Not all, maybe not even most, but some. While I don't always like the films themselves, Jonah Hill is always entertaining. I'm not familiar with Ayoade, but he was competent, to say the least. Still, they were stupid characters in an all too familiar situation. Cheap laughs with no originality. Enjoyable, perhaps, but completely forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The WatchNeighbourhood watch is typically more concerned with patrolling their community to ensure lawns are mowed to Board specifications.However, the concerned citizens in this sci-fi/comedy are coping with actual crime in their community: murder.When his employee is slain in a gruesome fashion, Evan (Ben Stiller) forms a community crime watch cabal to bring the killer to justice.Unfortunately, his call-to-arms only attracts his neighbourhood's strangest occupants: party- animal father Bob (Vince Vaughn), gun-nut Franklin (Jonah Hill) and recently divorced hornball Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade).Despite his colleague's lack of vigilance, Evan manages to uncover an alien plot to invade Earth.Now it's up to him and his rag-tag team to save the suburbs.With a familiar cast playing familiar archetypes and a one-dimensional invasion plot that feels abnormal, The Watch is unbalanced.Besides, if any community group is going to foil an alien invasion it's going to be the Stargazers Society.

		<fullReview>For a comedy, then "The Watch" didn't really deliver anything spectacular, and the laughs were actually far apart. And on that aspect the movie was somewhat of a disappointment. Especially because the names that were on the list, Ben Stiller, Vince Vaugh, Jonah Hill, Richard Ayoade and Will Forte, all usually make good comedies, but for some reason "The Watch" wasn't really all that fun.Sure the movie was good entertainment and actually had a great storyline, it just failed to pack any real laughs.Having sat through the movie, I somewhat feel a little bit cheated out of a comedy experience. But luckily, the movie did manage to somewhat make up for it with its storyline and great alien creature design.The characters in the movie were fairly stereotypical, and actually coming off a two-dimensional at most times. It was perhaps suffering from a lack of proper dialogue writing and character development. Which was a shame, because the movie did have potential, but never managed to raise itself out of mediocrity.I enjoyed the aliens, they looked great and had a very interesting appearance. And also I enjoyed the appearance of R. Lee Ermey, he is always a treat to have in movies. And when the neighborhood watch was duking it out with the aliens in slow motion, that was one of the best scenes in the entire movie, it was just great."The Watch" is not a bad movie, far from it, just don't expect a laugh-fest. It is a good Sci-Fi movie that is spiced up with the occasional touch of comedy here and there.</fullReview>

Even the retail Death Star that is Walmart should have requested, if not demanded, that all references to their business be pixel-lated from the movie so that they could save a little face. The actors couldn't even be bothered to pretend that they are performers playing characters in a movie, just sitting around shooting the breeze in the most boring soul crushingly awful manner that is possible. This is desolation, spare your mind, do not watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad....awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched this movie last night. Just plain awful. I'm a big fan of all these guys in most of their movies, although VV is really wearing on me with the same character he plays in every movie. This thing is a disaster. Disjointed, crap dialog, not funny, just plain uncomfortable to watch. For the record, loved Dodgeball, Fockers, Wedding Crashers, etc, but I might go as far to say this is the worst movie I've seen since Rocky IV. You'll need a time machine to get back the 90 minutes that you'll waste watching this garbage. I'm a bit surprised that it was ever made into a movie. On top of all that, there is gratuitous product placement throughout. Dick jokes, scat jokes, cum jokes, you name it, there all in here and probably couldn't make Beavis and Butthead giggle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am stunned at how such a good line up of talent could produce this piece of crap. Who's fault was this? Seth was one of three writers, I can only think it looked OK on paper. This might mean the director just didn't have a sense of timing or humor. CRINGE WORTHY should be on the promotional posters for this dud. It was hard to watch. If a bunch of 15 yr old boys got together to make a movie with childish dick jokes, this would be the result. While watching, I got the feeling Ben Stiller and co. started to realize how bad this movie was going to be. They looked embarrassed and probably realized it was too late to bale. This will be one of those "don't mention the war" type movies, journos will be told not to ask about this movie in future interviews.It is amazing 78,000 people thought this was better than a 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked that the trailer did not reveal too much of the "story" behind this movie. But I still get if people are disappointed in this. It's hard as I have written before to get people behind a comedy. And comedies that go for the "R-rating" are even tougher to sell. I still thought this was funny and different from what I expected (although the German title did give away more of the central story than the mentioned trailer).Ben Stiller plays it straight and you can see the morality that lies within the movie ... within the first 5 minutes of it. That doesn't take the fun out of it and the main 4 characters are having so much fun, it does translate on the screen. If you don't like the trailer though, do not watch the movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Ted' Is Still The Funniest Film Of The Summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Watch' is the new comedy staring Ben Stiller. Originally titled Neighbourhood Watch, the film follows four men as they try to prove that there is an alien invasion going on in their town. However, the police don't believe them and the men spend most of the time destroying peoples property instead of actually doing their job properly. I think this was where the film was meant to be funny? 'The Watch' is made up of Ben Stiller, Jonah Hill, Vince Vaughn and Richard Ayoade. The four men are probably the last four men in their town who should be doing this job, but they each have different motivations for joining the neighbourhood watch. Personally, I have never been a big Ben Stiller or Vince Vaughn fan. I like some of Stiller's films, but he isn't a comedian who would make me go and watch a film just because he is in it. Vince Vaughn is the same. I like some of films such as 'Wedding Crashers' or 'Dodge Ball' but then he has been in films such as'Couples Retreat' and 'The Dilemma' which I don't find funny. It's no surprise then that most of the laughs in the film come from Jonah Hill. Hill has been one of my favourite comic actors since I saw him in Superbad. He was also at the top of his game earlier this year with a very funny performance in '21 Jump Street'. It was in fact the work from Hill and Ayoade that sort of saved the film, even though it's not that good anyway.I would be lying if I said I didn't chuckle during the film, because I did. At one moment I laughed out loud, but on the whole, I didn't laugh as much as I wanted to. 'The Watch' for me was one of those comedies in which the cast throw joke after joke at the audience, and I found myself understanding all the jokes, but only laughing at a few of them. For long periods of the film I was just sitting in the cinema waiting for a funny joke to come along and when it did I laughed, but then I had to wait again for another joke.Another problem with the film is the story. I really liked the set up of the film and the idea that four idiots want to protect their town, that's funny. However, when the aliens become involved in the story, it didn't seem to make me enjoy the film any more, they were just there in order to show that the film had a big budget. We also have a sub plot involving Stiller and his wife trying for children. This also seemed a bit pointless and didn't add any emotion, depth or more importantly laughs to the film. In the screening I saw 'The Watch' in, many people were laughing at times in the film, but there were moments of silence in parts of the film. The people I saw the film with both said they really liked it and used the word 'enjoyable' to describe it. I can't say that 'The Watch wasn't enjoyable whilst I was watching it. I just felt it was nothing special and very average.Is 'The Watch' worth seeing at the cinema? No. Is it worth buying on DVD or blue ray? No. It's a film that I would probably watch again if it was on television and there was nothing else to do. As far as the comedies of 2012 go,'The Watch' isn't as disappointing as 'The Dictator', but is no where near as good as 'Ted' or '21 Jump Street'. It's a hit and miss comedy, that most of the time misses. If you want to watch an Alian invasion comedy, stick with 'Attack The Block'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A whole lot of tawdry humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CAN a movie teach us about male friendships while including aliens that look like those from Aliens? The Watch certainly tries its best, and while some of the humor is tawdry and involves penises, especially of the aliens', there is much to be laugh about.Bromance flicks aren't as abundant as chick flicks, but one that I remember is I Love You, Man (2009). Bromance flicks go much deeper than buddy flicks, as they follow the narrative of chick flicks, that is, there's a development of the friendship, the people enjoy each other's company, there's a crisis that threatens to disrupt the relationship but everything returns to normal at the end.Four guys with nothing much to do come together to form a neighborhood watch in their small town in Ohio, the US. The leader of the pack is Evan (Ben Stiller), a hypermarket manager whose goal in life is to form as many clubs as possible. He's an analytical dude who lives life according to rules.Then there's motormouth Bob (Vince Vaughn), whose peripatetic wife is hardly at home, which means he has to deal with the teenage angst of his daughter. Those who have seen Vaughn's movies know that he just can't stop yapping. In fact, he's like Will Smith.Rounding up the group are Franklin (Jonah Hill, who was like a junior Vince Vaughn in Superbad), who lives with his mum and has aspirations to be a cop, and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a Brit who's just come to the US.Evans prefers to dominate the group and just focus on business, but the other three prefer to booze and spend time at Bob's den.The group eventually gets to do some patrolling and is intent on finding out who killed a guard at Evan's store. This leads them to the discovery that aliens have been disguising themselves as humans in preparation for an invasion. While all this is going on, Evan confides in Bob about his sterility and that he hasn't told his wife about it, while Bob says that he has his hands full keeping an eye on his sexually precocious daughter. Those who have seen alien movies know that all aliens have a weak spot. Therefore, those in this flick are vulnerable in their groin, as their brains are enmeshed with their penises.Aha, say viewers, Evan's dick problem and the aliens' weak spot are related. Bob also has to prevent a guy from sticking a dick into his daughter.** Movie Magic With Jeff Lee (blogspot and Facebook)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A much better watch than I expected (see what I did there?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has received some terrible reviews and I for one did not hold out much hope for it. But, I actually found this film consistently funny (after the first 10 minutes or so). It contained several laugh out loud moments and the gags come at a swift rate.Ben Stiller is the manager of the local Costco and prides himself on being very public spirited. After a murder takes place in the store he manages, he organises a Neighbourhood Watch to solve the murder. The set up for the film is a little shaky and left me fearing the worst. But once Stiller is joined by his posse of Vaughn, Hill and Ayoade the laughs begin.The plot isn't great, but the four members of the watch each play well caricatured characters that gel together well. I can imagine that large chunks of the film are improvised by our four musketeers. This film is really a buddy movie, don't get too hung up on the inadequacies of the plot - but rather enjoy the interactions between the watch members. There is nothing ground breaking here. Stiller, Vaughn and Hill have played these characters time and time again in their individual films. Those that have seen the British TV show "The IT Crowd" will recognise Ayoade's character as a rehash of Moss. But, putting them all together works well.For my money, the film gets funnier the longer it goes on. Well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often amusing, but not really witty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bringing alien factor into crime and/or comedy movies is always tricky and slippery as there is a danger of ridiculousness. The Watch is totally not free from it either, although it is entertaining at times. This is, above all, thanks to Vince Vaughn, who as Bob is really the funniest and his lines are more amusing than among the rest. Ben Stiller is too poker-faced here, Jonas Hill and Richard Ayoade are just average. The uneven plot is full of offensive, black and sex humor, but does, however, include some nice scoffing at Western lifestyle, comprehension and family issues. Nevertheless, the outcome leaves a lot to be desired, there is also real synergy feeling between the four neighborhood watch members. And female characters are rather sketchy, providing no additional value to the movie.Well, if you like the actors and topics above, the movie is entertaining, otherwise see 21 Jump Street or Hot Fuzz, for example.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Watch is not a hilarious comedy, but I still think it's worth watching. There aren't many good movies coming out these days, so this one is absolutely better than a lot of other new releases. The movie starts off quite promising. Four guys starting a local Neighborhood watch. The four actors themselves are very funny, but sadly, they don't shine that bright in this one. Don't get me wrong. There are a lot of laughs in there, but the problem is that they don't last long. Just short jokes etc. Still there are many moments that at least will make you smile. Vince Vaughn and Jonah Hill are the funniest of the four of them, and make the movie at least feel like a funny comedy. Ben Stiller, however, isn't really that funny...but that's probably because he plays the most serious of the four "watchmen". The movies' biggest problem, is that it never really "takes off". The comedy never goes above OK. In other words, you will not laugh your pants off watching this. I didn't have huge expectations, but it's sad that a movie with Stiller, Vaughn and Hill isn't funnier than this. Comedy aside, the plot isn't really bad. It's an okay story, which I won't spoil. There are some twists in there.One of the better aspects of the movie is the special effects. The aliens look amazing. Really creepy and ugly. There are also some really nice explosions in there. But that's not enough to make a great movie. Overall, an okay movie. Okay humor, okay plot. I think it's worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>weak story, weak screenplay....but i did laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, this movie is absolute crap with a capital C. Second, I found myself laughing all the way through. It is a movie you can't recommend to anyone to go see, but you won't stop them if they are already on their way.The movie entered into development as Neighborhood Watch and was directed by Hot Rod (2007) director Akiva Schaffer, two months before it was released its name was changed to The Watch, because of the shooting of Trayvon Martin by a neighborhood watch member.The interesting thing about the movie is the dialogue; it is totally sick and contains a lot of uncalled for profanity that makes you wonder, but laugh.As weak as plots go, this is one of the weakest I have seen either Ben Stiller or Vince Vaughn in. The story started after the death of Evan's friend Antonio who had his skin ripped off, Evan formed a Neighborhood watch to guide against such occurrences occurring again.He was joined by Bob (Vince Vaughn) who was just looking for an avenue to hang out with the guys, Franklin (Jonah Hill) who was looking for an avenue to join any form of security force and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade) who just moved into the neighbourhood.Due to their relentless urge for the job, they get egged, knock out an alien, get invited to an orgy and blow up a departmental store.The band of misfits changed from Neighborhood Watch to Alien Hunters. This is not the first time Vince and Ben are working together, but this movie is weak. The story lacks depth, the characters back story are all too shallow for you to attach anything to them, which is bad as that is what makes a good movie, you the viewer being able to attach a distinctive attribute to a character, this makes the character memorable, thereby the movie is not easily forgotten.The movie shots were not so good for me, more like there were shy to show the alien at first then later changed their minds. The director is not getting any better at making movies, Hot Rod was a waste of time and this movie had no sense of creativity or professionalism in the area of directing, the characters and scenes all looked out of place at times.For example, the guys get egged, everyone is chasing some perpetrator after a while they focus on one, he gets caught, he is taken to the police, he is going home, he gets chased by an alien , he gets caught, alien crossing the street gets hit by car. All this happened in one stretch, and left me with this question. Why did the alien cross the road?He was jumping from roof to roof initially; it makes you wonder why he changed his mind this time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lousy. I liked it perhaps a little better than I thought I might, honestly, given its terrible reviews, but it's still quite bad. After an employee gets murdered, Costco manager Ben Stiller forms a neighborhood watch with three local men (Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and Richard Ayoade). They're kind of idiots, though, and cause more problems than they could ever possibly solve. They soon discover that the town's current crime spree is actually being caused by alien invaders, and the film becomes an action/comedy. Personally, I think there's a lot of talent in the cast. Of the four stars, Vaughn is the only one I'm not a big fan of (though I've found him amusing on occasion). Ben Stiller does a lot of crap, but when he gets good material he can deliver. Hill I think is a really undervalued comedian. Ayoade is the main reason I had to see this. He's the least familiar of the cast, but any fan of modern British comedy will know him from shows like The IT Crowd, The Mighty Boosh and Garth Marenghi's Darkplace. I particularly had high hopes that this would be his big ticket to international stardom. The film did bomb, but I suspect it will do okay on video. Even though it's bad, I hope people see Ayoade's talent and it will eventually lead him to better things. I think the main problem here is just the lack of a decent script. It has potential, but almost all the gags center around the genitalia, which, even on the rare occasion that it is funny, gets old. Rosemary DeWitt, Billy Crudup and Will Forte also co-star.</fullReview>

It's not the worst movie you will see, but it is not any good either. If you have watched at least one Ben Stiller movie, it most probably means that you have seen this one. Stiller and Vaughn have passed the time, when they were funny and Jonah Hill just doesn't have any chance in this movie. Boring story, no funny moments - actually this movie easily could have been only 1 hour and it would be pretty much the same.

		<shortDescription>This was clearly a case where less was better than more, but it seems nobody told that to the director Akiva Schaffer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclaimer: Sexual content and vulgar reference towards it still puts me in an awkward situation however old I get. So my general rule is to avoid R-rated films especially when they fall into the genre of comedy, romance or drama. Unfortunately I didn't carefully look at the IMDb parental advisory before I went for the film 'The Watch'. Anyway? this is clearly not my type of genre.'The Watch' is about Evan Trautwig (Ben Stiller) who's in love with his little town Glenview in Ohio and participates in various community initiatives while proudly managing a local Costco. After the mysterious murder of his colleague/friend Antonio Guzman (Joe Nunez), he takes it upon himself to set up a neighbourhood force to watch over the community and find the murderer. As volunteers Bob (Vince Vaughn), a possessive father; Franklin (Jonah Hill) a knife wielding police department reject who lives with his mom; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade) a housewife- fantasising Brit make up what he calls the 'neighbourhood watch'. As they stumble deeper into the mystery, they come face to face with aliens and an invasion with Glenview being ground zero.Ben Stiller is as reliable as ever, but then he has played the same character in a dozen films before. You don't see anything new but it's as well played through as expected. I've never been a fan of Vince Vaughn and honestly his foul mouthed 'seen it before' act doesn't change that. He does what he does well, but it still doesn't impress me. Richard Ayoade was refreshing in comparison and did manage to be funny whenever he got the opportunity. Jonah Hill for me was the best of the four. The way he held his own among the others was great to watch and the unstable trigger-happy act was good.From the people who wrote the brilliant but foul-mouthed teen film 'Superbad' (Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg along with Jared Stern), you can't help but expect better. With the mishmash of comedy and Sci-Fi (while flirting with horror, romance and drama), the film is left in doldrums while it keeps shifting almost abruptly between the genres. Then there were the unwanted subplots and characters that bloated the film's plots into the realm of senselessness.This was clearly a case where less was better than more, but it seems nobody told that to the director Akiva Schaffer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will audiences ever tire of seeing the Earth get attacked by aliens or vampires or zombies? The Watch tests the movie going public's appetite for world destruction in the form of a comedy. Nothing new we haven't seen before.The Watch brings absolutely zero creativity to the table. The funny cast gives exactly what you would expect from them. Ben Stiller (Meet The Parents, Zoolander) is the straight man doofus, Vince Vaughn (Wedding Crashers, Old School) the wacky, motor-mouthed instigator, &amp; Jonah Hill (Superbad, 21 Jump Street) the oddball wild card. They do provide some laughs, but most of the funny stuff can be seen in the trailer for free.For the most part, The Watch is a predictable and recycled middle of the road comedy, and the premise gets old quickly. If you are looking for a brainless escape with nothing really new to offer, then you might get a kick out of it. If you are looking for more bang for your buck then check out Ruby Sparks (or The Dark Knight Rises for a second time) instead.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com</fullReview>

He plays a sociopath loner who collects firearms. While the script makes several references to his interest in heterosexual sexual exploits, he has an odd obsession with large penises. Eventually the script morphs into a comedic version of "Aliens" in a final showdown at the local Costco.Ben Stiller is somewhat bland in the thankless role of straight man placed in the group of sophomoric buffoons who only want to belong to the neighborhood watch to bond and get drunk. The film is embarrassingly bad, and probably ranks as one of the worst comedies of the year.</fullReview>

The story is predictable. There is a crime in a silent community and Ben Stiller wants to create a neighborhood watch patrol. Of course, the group attracts odd balls. The character dynamic of Ben Stiller being overly uptight has friction with the overly reckless Vince Vaughan character. The friction of Stiller's seriousness pitted against Vaughan's silliness creates a humor dynamic. The script adds in aliens, and awkward character situations creating humorous plot devices. Much of the humor is low level. There is some laughs. If you like Vince Vaughan you will like The Watch. I give the Watch a six out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**I'm not sure if some of the details that I've included may be viewed as spoilers, but I've up the disclaimer just in case.** Wow, I have to admit, I'm pretty disappointed, in myself that is. For no other reason than, the simple fact that I waited so long to watch this fantastic movie.But for the life of me, I just can't understand why so many people are being so unbelievably negative about this film. I highly doubt that when Seth Rogan and the other writers got this script together that they sincerely thought that they had a masterpiece of the highest cinematic quality on their hands.This is a movie that has a little bit of everything... Action Adventure was demonstrated through scenes of graphic horror violence due to several shoot outs and fight scenes involving space creatures. Drama/Romance was depicted through the family aspects of the film, thanks in part to Vaughn and his struggles of being a parent; as well as Stiller's baby making troubles.Granted, in some spots things didn't quite gel as well as they could and the film clearly blurred the lines of several different genres. But honestly, I think it still works, and it's really quite funny.Now that brings me to my next point, the comedy. The comedic aspect alone ranges quite a bit, between situational and dialogue based comedy. The script is made up of crass conversations, immature, raunchy and at times down right vulgar, but none the less, hilarious dialogue.The film is comprised of a great cast. It stars, Ben Stiller as Evan the average Joe, responsible for recruiting: Franklin, the wacky borderline creepy one played by Jonah Hill; Bob the loudmouth, and only father of the group, who seems to just egg everyone else on, played by Vince Vaughn; And Jamarcus the awkward somewhat nerdy seeming character portrayed by Richard Ayoade. Collectively, they form the misfit band of brothers who call themselves the neighborhood watch. Finally, Will Forte who takes on the role of the overly cocky, under educated Sgt. Bressman, rounds out the cast. Although, Vaughn along with Hill undoubtedly stole the show with their crude jokes and wacky antics.Overall, "The Watch" is a great movie about a group of misfits who band together to protect their neighborhood, but run in to a few bumps along the way, making for some interesting situations to say the least. It's definitely not a movie for the family by any stretch of the imagination; it's quite simply, a funny movie that you would watch with the guys. And that just so happens to be my type of movie.So all in all, I feel as though this is a great movie, it's definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You will laugh, and then forget about it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an alien invasion happening; they are among us.The Watch had an outstanding comedic cast like most summer comedies tend to, but the material failed to live up to those talents once again. I really liked these actors and was hoping the film to be a huge success, but despite laughing several times I felt this film was missing something. I found myself laughing throughout several scenes, but at the same time thinking to myself how ridiculous and predictable the plot and jokes were. The material isn't really that good, but we have excellent actors that can make a mediocre movie into a better one and this was the case. The jokes weren't as funny as the performers. I'm still waiting for that one hit comedy of the year (I haven't seen Ted yet and am hoping that will be it), but I was definitely disappointed with The Watch despite not having a terrible time with it. The Watch is one of those films you might enjoy watching once if you're really bored, but you will probably want to stay away from a second viewing. The characters are all common stereotypes: you have the nerd who wants to please and befriend everyone, the man child who is always screaming (a character that Will Ferrell made famous), the sex driven guy with the funny accent, and the tough guy who still lives with his mother. They all come together once again for this buddy comedy that mixes the humor with a sci-fi adventure theme that really never works. The action and the comedy didn't blend in as well as it did in Pineapple Express for example, and in my opinion this film was trying to set a familiar tone.The plot revolves around four guys who decide to start a neighborhood watch group after a murder takes place in their small town. Evan (Ben Stiller) is always trying to please people and keeping busy in the community by starting local clubs and events. He's also the local manager of Costco and happily married to Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt) with whom he's trying to have a child. When a local guard from Costco is murdered he decides to begin a neighborhood watch in order to keep everyone safe and find the murderer. The police in town represented by Sgt. Bressman (Will Forte) are pretty incompetent, so Evan finds it in his kind heart to help despite not anyone else carrying. Only three neighbors show up to the first meeting after Evan gives his uninspiring speech to the community; they are Franklin (Jonah Hill), Bob (Vince Vaughn), and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade). The three of them really show up for different reasons: Bob wants to escape his married life and bond with the guys, Franklin always wanted to be a police officer but failed his exams, and Jamarcus is the foreigner who wants to make new friends (and if possible save a beautiful girl so she can reward him). None of them really know what they are going to go up against, and the rest of the community think they are a joke. The criminal they are looking for turns out not to be human, and when they encounter the alien for the first time they take it upon themselves to protect their neighbors at all costs.The film is as ridiculous as the premise sounds but you will find yourself laughing throughout the film because of the talented cast working together. One of the funniest scenes for me revolved around the four guys taking pictures of themselves with an apparently dead alien, but you can watch this scene in the trailers so I guess it's not saying much. The film is really predictable and forgettable but I didn't find it really awful either. By tomorrow I will have probably forgot all about it, but for an evening in which I had nothing to do it was OK. This is perhaps one of Seth Rogen's worst work as a screenwriter although he had some help this time and therefore can share the blame. The director, Akiva Schaffer, really hasn't had much experience as a film director since he is mostly known for his direction in Saturday Night Live. The film itself could have probably worked better as a five minute SNL sketch than a full feature film. Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller should try to do something different and move away from their typical roles. I could have said the same thing about Jonah Hill, but he did try something different in Moneyball and it completely worked for him, but he came back once again to his typical role. Richard Ayoade I had not heard of so I can't say anything on his behalf, but it pretty much felt to me that all these actors played it safe with their roles and didn't take any risks. That is why no one will remember The Watch came out by the end of the year.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't all that funny of a comedy and yes it's raunchy but it's actually quite watchable. Maybe it's because my expectations for this movie was very low since the trailer made it seem like it's going to be a super awful movie. But I will just say it's watchable. The plot is basically about a guy named Evan(Ben Stiller) who is the manager at Costco setting up a neighborhood watch team after one of his friend got killed. And the team is composed of Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and this one guy with a British accent. But a lot of people don't take neighborhood watch people seriously so they get into conflicts with other people because of it. Ben Stiller is basically Ben Stiller in this and Vince Vaughn is Vince Vaughn except he is more of the lets have fun and hangout kinda guy in this without being all that much of a dick. He usually plays the likable dick but he is cool in this one and the most likable member of the the team. And conflict ensues between Ben Stiller's character and Vince Vaughn's. Because one is a complete control freak and the most dis-likable member of the team and the other is a fun and cool guy. It's slightly like Captain America and Tony Stark arguing back and forth. Jonah Hill is Jonah Hill in this and he doesn't really add all that much to this movie nor does he takes away. Overall most of the entertainment value comes from it seeming like the neighborhood watch team in this might be cool to hang around with. The characters in this however seemed like they were trying a bit too hard to be funny with remarks that is kinda dumb but not all that funny. Overall it's a watchable movie, nothing more.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Watchable (Surprisingly)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So often the movies that you don't expect much from are the one's that surprise you, and for me, The Watch was just such a 'one'.Yes, it's juvenile, the plot is nonsense and there's nothing here you haven't seen before, but it's also very quotable and more than just a touch silly in the vein of the superb 'Hot Fuzz'.Whether you enjoy this film or not will almost wholly depend on whether you find the humour humorous or tedious. It's a hit or miss, really.Perhaps the reason my wife and myself found it so funny was because we'd just endured the joy-less and vastly over-rated 'Dark Knight Rises', so anything following on from that would be a relief.Get your silly hat on and give a go!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Watch" (2012) - Bumbling do-gooders are worth a watch...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Watch" is not the first movie in Hollywood to be haunted by a sense of untimeliness, nor will it ever truly be the last. It was originally titled "Neighborhood Watch," but after the shooting of unarmed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin earlier this year by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman (who, just as an aside, attended my high school while I was a freshman and he was a senior), the name was changed. It is presumed that by retaining its original title, "The Watch" would not only seem untimely, but it would also be accused of being in bad taste."Bad taste" is a badge that "The Watch" wheres boldly, and proudly. And NO ONE ever said that comedy had to always be in good taste.The film stars Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and Richard Ayoade as four neighborhood watch volunteers who also represent our current society's fascination with changing concepts of masculinity, male-bonding, and the (alleged) obsession with guns and violence (this last part only becoming more relevant in the wake of several high-profile mass shootings in recent months, most notably the theater shootings in Colorado during a screening of "The Dark Knight Rises").With this fascination with guns and violence, I'm reminded of the controversy that swirled around "The Matrix" (1999) in the wake of the Columbine shootings and what influence - if any - it had on the Columbine shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Nothing ever really changes, because life simply just has a funny habit of imitating art (and not the other way around); to be totally honest with you here, I just feel that things like this are just an unfortunate coincidence, with society pointing fingers at everything else except itself.But moving onto the movie, "The Watch" is highly watchable male-bonding &amp; masculinity mixed with violence and vulgarity. Of course what makes it work is the chemistry between the four leads. Evan Trautwig (Stiller) explains in the film's opening narration that his town of Glenview, Ohio, is the ideal place to live. Civic-minded, Evan is highly active in his community and is behind just about every single effort to make it a great place to live and raise a family - almost to the point of it all being an obsession. He also has Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt), his lovely and devoted wife.Evan also works as the manager of the local Costco. When his trusted night-watchman is gruesomely murdered on the job one night, Evan decides the best thing to do is to form a neighborhood watch group to prevent any further attacks. He's aided by three others - fun-loving, motor-mouthed family man Bob (Vaughn); high school dropout and police academy-reject Franklin (Hill); and newcomer Jamarcus (Ayoade) - who each have their own separate reasons for wanting to join up (mostly boredom and because they have nothing else better to do) but they all still believe, deep down in their hearts, in wanting to do the right thing and serve &amp; protect the community.The foursome soon find themselves way in over their heads as they try to investigate several more gruesome murders (while earning the derision of the lazy and inept local law enforcement), only to find themselves thwarting an other-worldly invasion by sinister aliens head-on. I won't spoil by revealing what these extraterrestrial nasties look like, but do know that they're a formidable threat, a grotesque, unholy hybrid that's a cross between "The Fly II" (1989) and "Alien" (1979)."The Watch," like most movies centering around testosterone and male-bonding, offers up a great deal of raunchiness, vulgarity, and sex talk; it only goes to further ensure that "The Watch" is hard "R"-rated comedy that's strictly for adults and not those teenagers who also love this stuff and find it utterly fascinating. That the screenplay was written by Jared Stern, Seth Rogen &amp; Evan Goldberg (the latter two of whom collaborated on their best - in my opinion - "Pineapple Express" back in 2008) and directed by Akiva Schaffer, the raunchy attitude and vulgarity should really be of no surprise to anyone. And the oft-gruesome violence and slow-motion John Woo-style shoot-outs that dominate the film's third act should also please the few action movie junkies left in the audience as well.The four leads excel as best buds on a mission to make the world a better place. Ben Stiller more or less plays it straight as straight-laced community leader (and Neighborhood Watch leader) Evan Trautwig; he provides the vicarious Everyman in all of us in the audience and is the one we most identify with. Vince Vaughn and Jonah Hill form the core muscle of the group and get many of the best laughs; Bob comes up with the blue jackets and logos for the group. And Richard Ayoade, the newbie outsider, provides some wisdom and reason."The Watch" is a highly watchable flick about bumbling do-gooders that is definitely worth the watch - at least once.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Watch Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while a comedy comes along and pushes the boundary just a little bit over board this is it. It got my blood pumping with some laughter, and then out of the blue an alien is on the loose. Not that I didn't know that a green extraterrestrial being would pop in at some stage. I just hate how there is no background provided about their planet and their method of arrival ie. spaceship. I guess comedy fans are dumb and naive. Hey let's laugh while an alien suddenly appears and kills people take pictures and dance under the moonlight with it, dude that's so cool.This is not one for the kids the amount of explicit cursing is over the top and a surprise sex scene is not one to laugh at. The effort is good and the usual issues of society bring about unexpected humour plus you never get bored and lost in other things. A lot of films have things that the audience gets lost in not here. You should go see it really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People who expect movies to be clean mouthed, high brow humor should read who is in it and what it's about - and who wrote it - before seeing it. Ben Stiller is not known for highbrow family-oriented humor. His humor is Night at the Museum, Meet the Parents, Zoolander, Tropic Thunder. Also, the writers here include Seth Rogen. Seth's movies include Zack and Miri Make A Porno and The 40 Year Old Virgin. If you don't like a good guffaw over some fun, sometimes immature, comedy antics go to the highbrow humor you want. There is room for everything. I thoroughly enjoyed this silly movie about an oddball group of men saving their world from aliens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm really confused as to why this film is scored below 6 and slandered with so many negative review's. I am a fan of all actors and the director so as you can imagine I was very excited for this film but when I started seeing negative reviews prior to viewing the film it did lower my exceptions a bit.But there was no need! I loved the watch and I would consider it one of my favourite comedy's this year along side 21 Jump street, Project x and of course American Reunion. I found at least a hand full of really laugh out loud moments that the whole cinema joined me in, the acting was great, just as expected with such a big cast. Notable mentions are Will Forte, Richard Ayoade and even though it was short, the lonely island have a hilarious cameo! The story was interesting and paced well, I found myself interested and enjoying myself for the whole hundred minutes. So overall, Don't believe the scores on here or from other critics, The Watch is definitely worth a watch with a few mates, Its funny, action packed and an all around good time, I definitely recommend!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Watch is a film about a group of neighbors, led by Evan (Ben Stiller) who form a watch following a criminal act and soon discover that their town has been invaded by aliens. Things including a cow as seen in the trailer are blown up and with some really huge explosions led me to believe that the target audience is definitely the fellows. With all the jokes about sports equipment (balls) and numerous references to just about every item in the male reproductive tool box, I had to get over any initial embarrassment by mid-movie in order to try and get some enjoyment out of the film. Most of this movie's running time of an hour and a half plus felt like an extended Costco commercial, this story went well beyond clever product placement and made me wonder if Costco just completely funded making this film, well there may have been some funding help from Rayovac and Tide (P&amp;G). There were some funny segments beyond those seen in the trailer, but none of it was nearly as funny as the guys in the theater behind me made it out to be. They were screaming with laughter especially at the sports equipment jokes and I had to question if my sense of humor was waning as I age. Probably not, guys tend to find crass humor to be very funny. One of the best relationships in this story was not between the guys within the neighborhood watch, but was between Bob (Vince Vaughn) and his daughter Chelsea (Erin Moriarty), it was surprising to find caring and respect under the layers of profanity and defiance, but as unconventional a relationship as it was, it still worked. I know this was a comedy but everyone played the straight man, I would say if anyone was the comic relief it was Franklin (Jonah Hill), although he like the rest of the guys took themselves so seriously, maybe that's what was supposed to be funny, the playing as if it is all real. Every time that I see R. Lee Ermey (Manfred) in a role, I wonder if he ever gets tired of being type-cast, even as a civilian he still seems military. This was a funny film with some toilet humor. Most of the bits and the overall story was fairly predictable, but I liked it well enough, I have to go with an amber light.</fullReview>

'The Watch' WAS actually funny, it made me laugh then the majority of modern comedies, which are usually poor. The cast is brilliant. 'The Watch' has four strong lead actors, Jonah Hill &amp; Richard Ayoade being the strongest, Ben Stiller being the weakest and Vince Vaughn is better then usual. The narrative and premise is fun and the aliens actually look good (from a design perspective). Overall 'The Watch' is a fun, crude, rude comedy that's better than the majority, but overall to most people it's either a hit or a miss, I'd definitely recommend it, at least give it a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though 'The Watch' is barely a masterpiece, I do believe critics are unfairly trashing it and picking on it. It's rude, loud, fun and very funny, and if you don't mind this kind of comedy you should definitely give it a go.My expectations were low after seeing bad review after bad review, but when I saw the actual movie I did really enjoy it. Of course, there's nothing particularly memorable but it's really not hard to sit through. I myself have never been a fan of Ben Stiller or Vince Vaughn, but after seeing this I've changed my mind a little. It's not 'just a string of dick jokes' like some critics have decided to hail it, because if it was just that I'd have hated it. But no, 'The Watch' is consistently funny and never gets boring.Just to give another example: last year there was '30 Minutes or Less', another comedy that got the same treatment as 'The Watch' - everyone decided to hate it, despite it being a good laugh and a very fun ride. There's nothing at all bad about these films, and you shouldn't expect so much from them.The Verdict: nowhere near the disaster most are hailing it as (it doesn't even have THAT many dick jokes), 'The Watch' is a hell of a laugh for its target audience at least, and it's a very, very fun ride.</fullReview>

The story line was original and yes a lot of the humor was just crude unfunny jokes but much of the dialouge was actually pretty clever. The actors did a good job for the most part definitely not as good as they can do though.This movie is about a man who works at costco when someone is murdered during the nighttime sercuirty shift. He spreads the word that he is making a neighborhood watch to find the murderer. A group of people show up and they try to find the murderer soon discovering the murderer is not human.This movie was by no means the best comedy but its worth a watch thats for sure. It has many comedy stars and a lot of it is pretty funny. It would probably appeal to more younger audiences 8th graders will go nuts for this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I literally just watched this film with the impression that it was going to be a "mediocre comedy with bad acting and a predictable storyline". I believe it was the complete opposite. Maybe it's because I didn't have the expectations that everyone else had, but I honestly was laughing out loud the whole way through this film, it's hilarious! The humour just bounces off of all the characters perfectly (especially the 4 main guys), and it's consistent throughout! Not a dull moment! The story is somewhat predictable once the story begins to open up, but that doesn't override the excitement and enticement this film brings one bit. I believe people took the film to seriously due to the great cast lined up and the fact that Ted was released the same time completely dominating this film, which is a shame because it really did deserve to do better. I'm not saying it's a five star golden globe nominee film but it sure as hell made me laugh and I would jump at the chance to watch it again! LOVE IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The revival of comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Watch' really surprised me because Ben Stiller films can be a hit or a miss, this one was a hit. Usually his best performances are the ones where he ridicules himself (Tropic Thunder and Dodgeball being good examples), his other films can be funny but you always find yourself comparing them to the two other films I just mentioned. The script was pretty much Men In Black but for a slightly older audience; there was a lot more comedic gore and vulgarity here but it worked well. The jokes were really funny, the various sequences worked well and the film genuinely made me laugh. The performances are probably what made this film so funny. Vince Vaughn really surprised me as it's been a while since I've seen perform as well as he does here. Both he and Jonah Hill definitely give the best performances in the film. Jonah Hill is really funny here but he needs to be around the right crowd to be funny. Richard Ayoade gives a great performance here but I fear he will be type-cast into this role over and over again in the future. However, he does perform well and hopefully is seen in some more feature films. Ben Stiller unfortunately isn't fantastic here; he plays the average man here and is supposed to be the normal one amongst a group of odd ones. I don't know why he is put in roles like this because he is clearly capable of so much more.Overall, 'The Watch' is really funny and may signify the revival of Hollywood comedy that '21 Jump Street' hinted towards. I really hope more films as funny as this come out because this has shown that it is still possible to make hilarious pictures.</fullReview>

I thought the character Ben Stiller played in the movie is a character hes played in a lot in his most recent movies, I like the character he plays in movies like DodgeBall, and Zoolander. Hes too serious in this movie. Vince Vaughn character was the funniest to me. Jonah Hill played a good part as well, and also the other guy who I have never herd before was OK as well. This movie was a good one to watch when you feel down and need a stupid comedy to cheer you up. Its not my top 250 but its also not my bottom 250.</fullReview>

If you just let yourself enjoy it with out analysing each scene your sure to come out of the film thinking it was funny and enjoyable, however if you think about each scene and about the whole story then you realise it just wasn't a good film.My Rating: 5.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Costco Manager Evan (Ben Stiller) starts a neighbourhood watch when a night watchman is killed. Joined by Bob (Vince Vaughan), Franklin (Jonah Hill) and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), they meet disbelief when they encounter an alien invasion.Stiller plays an uptight, anal-type. We have seen him do this before. Vaughan plays a gobby, assertive but anti-authoritarian type. We have seen him do this before. Hill plays a mildly psychotic, mildly idiotic mummy's boy. This is a mild variation on what we have seen him do before. Ayoade plays a mildly spaced out nerd. You might not have seen him do this before but, if so, it is only because you haven't seen him in anything before.The young people in the cinema laughed at this more than I did. I did find some of the smut amusing, but I found most of it to be simply smut. And there's a lot of it. Do people really go around talking to each other like that? With the exception of Ayoade's simple but pleasant Jamarcus, the other three members of the Watch are irritating. The plot is solid enough, but not delivered particularly well.If you like non-stop sex talk and the odd chuckle delivered by people who are capable of much better, then this may be the film for you. It left me vaguely disappointed.</fullReview>

The movie did not hold as many laughable moment I expected with Jonah in there, but did provide a fair amount. On a comedy level it was allot better than the "Not another Teen Movie" "Scary Movie" type deal. It was that type on an alien level and they pulled it off excellently.I was skeptical before watching because it wasn't a cast I would off hand want to see, but their acting meshed well, and I can't see anyone watching optimistically not having a great time watching this film.I would recommend it to my friends and say that it was on the level higher level than most of the movies coming out today. It was original comedicly and deserves its respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was such a laugh and scary at the same time which is a great combination. First of all the actors were absolutely great and the thing that made me watch this movie is the actors because they used the best actors and to me they are the best actors to play in a comedy movie because i have watched so many movies with them and they are funny with only one of them but all of them combined made the movie seriously funny. At the beginning i was a bit concerned if it really was a comedy and not a horror movie but then as the movie went on i started to realize that it definitely was a comedy with a bit of thriller in some parts. The alien was quite scary when you first see it. So i must admit some parts weren't really for people ages 15 but 18 because there were some sex preferences which i don't think many people would be very comfortable watching this with their parents as well so i must point that out. THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE. IF YOU LOVE FUNNY AND SCARY MOVIES WATCH THIS!! IF YOU LOVE SCARY MOVIE 1,2,3,4,5 THEN THIS IS A MOVIE FOR YOU, AND IF YOU DON'T LOVE SCARY MOVIE 1,2,3,4,5 THEN THIS MOVIE IS STILL FOR YOU!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All around good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I'm not a huge Ben Stiller fan but he really managed to pull off some magic in this movie. It's a little out of his usual genre with the whole raunchy comedy theme but he managed to fit in perfectly with the rest of the cast on this one. Going into this movie without reading anything about it beforehand left me surprised with how everything turned out but that just made it all the more worth watching. I was expecting some Superbad style movie but instead we received an alien/comedy film. It's also nice to see that they didn't half ass the aliens! Most types of supernatural-comedy type films usually pry too much toward comedy and don't give a whole lot of detail into the supernatural parts but I was pleased to find out that they incorporated both into the movie and made everything fit in so well it almost felt like a kick ass action alien fighting film while still hanging onto that comedy feel. I would defiantly recommend this to someone who enjoys movies like Superbad and Knocked up.10/10 Hope to see more from Vince Vaughn and Jonah Hill in the future :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a little bit biased by the previous negative comments related to the movie, but as I usually go to the theater to relax and not to look for a masterpiece, I finally watched it.My conclusion: the film is really entertaining, since it is an obvious parody of what are portrayed as the main elements of any extraterrestrial Sci-Fi flick: (i)the characters that discover the E.T. presence in their city are not taken seriously, (ii) the aliens always choose a place as a "hidden" headquarters and (iii) the aliens have an unusual weakness.You should see how such elements are developed in the movie and then you will be able to judge it.A 7.0 rating works perfectly for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't really want to rate this film out of 10 because its not the greatest of all time but it does play a part in film history. The cast to begin with fitted me very well as I am a FAN of the main four actors. In terms of performances, Ben Stiller played out his classic American comedy role, Vince Vaughn, I found quit annoying in this film; which was probably intended in the role he was playing where he would control the most idiotic of the group, Franklin, played by Jonah Hill who did a good job as usual just playing out some easy variable comedy styles. Richard Ayoade was a true winner for me and a wild card almost, to incorporate a more British comedy with still the flat out "dick jokes". Topped off with Lord Akiva Schaffer with I was most excited about being a man of the internet and he did a great job, and sneaking in his cohorts into a local orgy. Some hilarious moments in this film where the most weird and wonderful occurred to stir hilarity in my local cinema. The plot wasn't particularly riveting but it didn't stay still and clear what was to happen next. The cinematography I found at times to be quite like that of a Youtube video where he would leave a glide cam running a bit too long for a structured scene setting. I very much enjoyed this film, go out and watch this before its gone. Some very varied reviews but the ratings should be higher. Good luck Kiv! HTTP://www.you tube.com/DijitaleFilms</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>rude and crude but damn funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Listen to all those saying this film is underrated. If you enjoy comedies such as Pineapple Express, Attack the Block and Superbad then you will enjoy this film. Although not quite as good as those mentioned it should still put a smile on your face. While Hill, Vaughn and Stiller are entertaining, it is Richard Ayoade who steals the show as a seemingly out of place Brit whose slightly awkward nature and love for beer and Asian housewives, consistently delivers laughs throughout the film. However, despite Ayoade's fantastic performance the other characters only dilute the laughs contributing many chuckles, but not the laugh out loud moments one would hope for: at their funniest as a group rather than individually. If you are not a fan of crude humour you probably wouldn't enjoy this film, with sex and penis jokes a plenty, however if this is what floats your boat, then this film certainly delivers the laughs. Entertaining on the whole and fun to watch provided one goes with an open mind. Don't decide you won't like it before hand, allow yourself to enjoy it for what it is: rude, crude and silly, but entertaining all the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No it's not Dickens but it isn't advertised as such. What you see is what you get and that's basically four guys all with pretty good comedy creds (outstanding work from Richard Ayoade of the IT Crowd), great comedic interaction and bucket-loads of action-movie wish-fulfillment. Also, they've ironically kicked every genre trope in the teeth: "But why are you attacking our planet?" "Because we're aliens, that's what we do. We find a planet, attack and destroy, then we move on". Because it's a Ben Stiller/ Vince Vaughn movie there's a lot of goo/ swearing/ physical humour and slapstick but again, no one that shows up for this movie is doing so expecting any different. I found this movie extremely entertaining. Also, Moss shooting aliens in slow motion=priceless XD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Evan (Ben Stiller) is stand up guy, he is involved in his community, manages the local Costco, and always goes out of his way to do the right thing. He is alarmed when there is a murder in his home town and seeks to find the assailant. This is the genesis of the neighborhood Watch. What starts off as a group of activist becomes a link to a secret among the townspeople. That there are aliens waiting for their mark to take over, and so the Watch is a hilarious adventure into our nation's security policy, "if you see something, say something." The movie changes courses though out the tale and is a funny peek into one man's Don Quixote odyssey into making a difference. Being from Marietta, Georgia it is kind of neat to see local sites in the movie, from a clear shot of our downtown Marietta Square to some of the side streets. Another sign of the influence of a little bit of the south merged into the movie magic scene.</fullReview>

If you stop analyzing every scene and just relax and enjoy every silly joke, you will be very satisfied in the end. I recommend it to those who aren't sensitive at "penis" jokes or any kind of humor that implies body parts. Some say it's too much, I didn't think so. Some say it's too vulgar (but vulgar in an innocent,childish,silly way) but I think that's what makes it so funny and everyone watching it with me in that movie theater seemed to agree with me, because everyone laughed so much, it was great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't seen previews and wasn't sure what to expect--afraid it might be another Dumb and Dumber, or maybe just a movie trying too hard. I was pleasantly surprised. We laughed all the way through it. It was fun to watch these lovable losers 'protect' their neighborhood. Some reviews criticize the vulgarity. (C'mon, folks; it's rated 'R', what do you expect? An 'R' rating used to be borderline 'X', but this movie is pretty tame, IMHO). It's not sophisticated--don't expect Woody Allen. It'll play to the suburbs more than to jaded urbanites. It's way more of 'humor' than 'sci-fi'. Sci-fi fans won't see anything new here--it's all stock, with moments of parody, lightly poking fun at memorable bits from iconic movies (ET, etcetera). It is rather juvenile, but that's to be expected. Juvenile can be fun. This is a non-pretentious, guy-humor film. Comedy should make you laugh. This one does. Age difference of two viewers who loved it: over 50 and under 30.</fullReview>

It's a rude film but it is one of the most funnest films you'll ever see. But I would recommend that any one under the age of 15 should not watch it. As of rude and scary/weird scenes but will have you laughing non stop. It has some of the most funnest actors in it. I would recommend that any one with a sense of humour should watch it or if you love aliens. It's a good beginning and a brilliant ending. One of my most best top ten films and is a film that you'll love too. Lots of things happen all the time it's kind of a action film as well as a comedy I would give it 8 out of 10, the story is not like you think it's going to be, well what I thought any way. Over all this is a excellent film with good actors for the parts, anything from out of space kill it.</fullReview>

I watched the whole thing, and laughed through the whole thing. Sure it was cheesy, but that's what comedies are. Sure there was some foul language, but come on, its Jonah Hill and Vince Vaughn. When I read the plot about them starting a neighborhood watch only to find out they have to stop an alien invasion, I started the movie with serious skepticism, but shortly into the movie, it caught my attention and I found myself laughing through over half the movie. If you are like me, and you like comedies, this one has enough laughs in it to make it more than watchable. I'd even watch it again. That's just my opinion, take it or leave it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller headlines this decent chuckler as stuck up community member Evan, who starts a Neighbourhood Watch after his Costco employee was viciously murdered by an alien. With nonchalant booze-head Bob (Vince Vaughn), mentally unstable Franklin (Jonah Hill) and straight-faced weirdo Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade) all in tow, Evan must stop the otherworldly beasts from destroying the whole planet. This is pretty lightweight guff, but thanks to a healthy gag rate and a surprisingly effective action finale, The Watch succeeds in being a nice dose of escapism - especially after the comedy catastrophe last month that was The Campaign. It also unearths Ayoade (from Brit show The IT Crowd) as one to, erm, watch on the Hollywood scene; his straight-faced oddness and subtly timed dialogue is priceless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much to my chagrin, sometimes, somehow vulgar and stupid works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am really tired of the rash of so called comedies as of late. The Jonah Hill/Seth Rogen/Adam Sandler and so on and so forth's of the world have decided comedy has to be vulgar disgusting rude comedy that is usually not even remotely funny. I'm looking at you Dictator, That's My Boy, The Sitter, Babymakers...I could go on for days. These are some of the worst movies I have ever seen. I knew The Watch was going to follow that same idea. How many times can we utter profanity, body parts and generally crude talk and see if people laugh. It's not even working anymore. That's My Boy, Dictator and now this one all severely underperformed at the box office. Now that big rant out of the way, somebody slap me because I actually enjoyed this. It was silly and juvenile and yet the story actually was sort of funny, unique, and filthy of course. Somehow the idiocy of the four of them came together and was entertaining. Ironically it seems that this film has a lot of bad feedback because I thought it was worlds better than some of the other filthy comedies out there. I had either forgotten or didn't realize the film revolved around an alien invasion and that added the fun unique quality to it.Ben Stiller is sort of hit and miss for me. I've liked some of his films and he sort of has a dry serious humour that I actually like. This role is not a stretch for him, in fact it's almost the same role he always plays but it fits well into the cast and he's always good at controlling the wilder members of the cast. Vince Vaughan is also a hit and miss for me. He is usually the same in most of his performances too and this is no different. He's the wild, loud, cool guy that everyone flocks too. He's probably the most crude (yep even more than Johan Hill) and him and Stiller are fun together. Jonah Hill is NOT a hit and miss for me. I can't stand him 99.9% of the time. Well surprise surprise this was one of his best roles. He's much quieter than usual playing the brooding violent Franklin. His one liners are boisterous or in your face and this might be a turning point in comedy for him proving he can actually do other things. Richard Ayoade joins the cast as the bizarre Jamarcus. He's decent but basically just supporting the other three which is appropriate given he is the lesser known of the cast. Rosemarie DeWitt plays Stiller's wife, not a big part but she's good in it and good with him. And finally honourable mention to Will Forte who can also overdo it but does it fine in this film as the disbelieving cop.Another of this latest filth movie comedians that I cannot stand is Seth Rogen and imagine my shock when I discovered he co-wrote this. The film still uses all the nasty words and tries to shock you by uttering female and male genitalia in every way possible which is just so stupid and I'm tired of it. And yet somehow, in some strange way the story and characters actually won me over. This is not even remotely close to a family film and should absolutely be left to adults but I think adults will actually enjoy it. It's sort of fantasy/Science Fiction/Comedy and if you like any one of the main cast (well I'm sorry that you do-I kid) then you will certainly enjoy The Watch. As always with this type of film, turn off your brain and enjoy the special effects. On that note I was actually thoroughly impressed with the alien special effects, and the fight scenes were really well done. It isn't a big surprise that director Akiva Schaffer comes from Saturday Night Live because it feels like an SNL skit run long but in a good way. Despite how unpopular this opinion will be...I liked it plain and simple. 8/10</fullReview>

I am not a big Ben Stiller fan but I love pretty much anything Vince Vaughn and Jonah Hill do. While this was very funny and I did enjoy it I was hoping for funnier. I'm not saying I didn't laugh because I did quite a bit, but with those two in the same movie my expectations were just a little too high. If you are looking for a movie to put in with a group and sit back and laugh then this is still a good choice.

		<shortDescription>Who YA Gonna Call ---- The Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very terrible murder occurs when security guard Joe Nunez is killed on the job during the evening hours at a Costco (Walmart) store. He's ripped limb from limb. But life goes on in his red state suburban paradise as folks return to their humdrum lives. Not however for Ben Stiller who was the manager at Costco and Nunez's supervisor. He organizes a neighborhood watch and starts looking for recruits to patrol his town and assist the police who are less than enthusiastic about his help. Not that they're anything to write home about.Stiller gets four recruits all with issues and he's got a few himself. Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill, and Richard Ayoade are not what anyone would pick for a law enforcement career. Especially Ayoade, but I can't say more.A few more murders occur and the guys between some fun times in Vaughn's alpha male basement discover that there's a nest of aliens who are using their town as ground zero for an invasion of Earth. It falls to them to save the planet let alone their red state way of life.The four members of the watch work well together. The gags don't come off as good as they should, but I fault the direction for that. Best of the bunch is Jonah Hill who could never pass any law enforcement tests, physical or psychological, but has what's needed to save the world.The Watch is a pleasant and amusing comedy that fans of any of the members should like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Originally reviewed at thestabilo.comGot Protection?This flick has about as much focus as a kid with ADHD in a room full of colours and boobs. The Watch, previously titled Neighbourhood Watch is your typical sci-fi comedy filled with laughs, bangs and "WTF's!?"Written by such comedic genii (writer's note: That's right- genii. Plural of genius) Seth Rogan, Evan Goldberg and *ahem* Jared Stern, The Watch is directed by Akiva Schaffer who's got a lot of SNL cred to his name. Starring in this thang is Ben "Just For Men hair colouring" Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah "Eating Healthier" Hill, Richard "I got nothing, sorry" Ayoade, Rosemarie "Multiple personalities that should still be on air" DeWitt and Will "Give me 10 lines and I'll win an Oscar" Forte.The Watch is about control freak and all-round good guy Evan Trautwig (Stiller) starting a neighbourhood watch with a band of misfits after a security guard is murdered at the local Costco. (SHAMELESS PRODUCT PLACEMENT ALERT) Of which Evan is a manager. What follows is a fuster-cluck of Sci-fi and hilarity!WHAT WORKED:- The music. Hot dizamn! This film has got some rocking tunes that just put you in a happy mood. They don't shy about it. This movie is a good time, and I'd like for it to DJ my next party. Sorry Uncle Vernon.- The jokes. They might not be spaced out well throughout, but hot damn when they land, they hit right. I had a solidly sore knee from the slapping I gave it. There have been too many times where a comedy is just a good movie, that keeps me entertained but doesn't have be laughing. I'm looking at you Superbad.- The special effects. Not much to say other than they must have blown their budget there. Top notch.WHAT DIDN'T WORK:- Stiller. I'm sorry buddy. But he just felt so forced in this one. After seeing his heartfelt performance in Tower Heist, I felt he phoned this one in.- Vaughn. He didn't phone this one in. I just feel like he plays the same character in every film. Now this might not be his fault, but how many times can you play the sleaze-ball with a heart of gold?- The pacing. This is kind of related to the jokes. This film is a good time, But like any party it falls a little stale somewhere near the 3/4 mark. The reveal is obvious, but it plays like they think the audience is stupid, when they should have cut out 10 minutes, or added seven minutes of "picture party" fun.- The foley work. Holy crap. Useless sound effects for random objects. I KNOW IT'S A CELL PHONE. I CAN SEE IT. Even some of the walking sounds were off. Maybe they hired a crappy foley artist when they realized they had blown their budget on the visual effects.THE LOWDOWN:- This is a good time. No doubt about it. You have a crew of heavyweight comedic actors, a premise that's been done before with an extraterrestrial spice that makes it feel new and shiny. It's a funny flick until it's lul about 70 minutes in, But after that it's jam-packed with action. It's got laughs. It's got great music. It's even got boobies. Go see this flick as it will rock your socks.The Watch is So Damn Close To AWESOME It's Scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Watch stars a big name cast - Ben Stiller as Evan, Vince Vaughn as Bob, Jonah Hill as Franklin and finally Richard Ayoade as Jamarcus. It is about a group of 4 guys who create a neighborhood watch because of a recent killing in their town. But when they find the killer they must overcome an alien force to save Earth from an alien invasion. Good concept, great actors and Seth Rogen involved in the screenplay. What could possibly be bad about it? Well, a few things. First off, Ben Stiller isn't funny anymore. The script felt lazily written, and it seemed like they thought - "Oh well, it's a comedy so people won't really mind if we do this." - I didn't, but that still doesn't justify having a lazily written script. There was only a few funny bits throughout, and they were mostly from Jonah Hill. A lot of the jokes were overused and very basic. I just didn't find it funny, a few of the jokes were also a bit of obvious. I also thought, with a storyline like that, it would stray away from the usual sex jokes which have plagiarized modern comedies. But no, they were still there and plentiful and as always unfunny. However, the film moves along at a nice pace and has my interest throughout. I liked the fact that it has a twist on the usual alien clichs we have becomes used to. Jonah Hill, as always, delivers nearly every time he's on-screen and I have to say, Vince Vaughn was actually good too, and I don't usually like him that much. Richard Ayoade wasn't the best in it, and I think they should have gotten Seth Rogan or someone more capable to play the fourth-person. As I heard a lot of it was improvisation.It isn't the best film, but does provide laughs, however rare and mildly amusing they are. I felt they could have done a lot more with the film but as I said, it felt extremely lazy, like they thought they would make money with that cast, so there's no point in putting much effort into it.A poor 6/10</fullReview>

Lame sci-fi comedy that tries to do for neighborhood watches what GHOSTBUSTERS did for paranormal scientists but fails miserably in this one-note gimmick with Stiller (who really needs to start stretching from his annoying intense scrutinizing schmucks; seriously) who enlists three unlikely neighbors to investigate a murder of one of his employees only to uncover a galactic invasion of aliens hellbent on crushing the planet (YAWN) with haphazard results. Vaughn is in his trademark motormouth ass mode; creepily svelte down Hill tries TOO hard to be a wanna be bad-ass; and the Zeppo Marx of this ungainly quartet is Brit comedian Ayoade who.I.LOATHED. Seriously so not funny at all. The by-the-numbers-boring- and-way-too-stupidly-vulgar-for-no-reason-crass screenplay by Jared Stern, Seth Rogen &amp; collaborator Evan Goldberg feels half-baked at best and newbie director Akiva Schaffer has no skill for comedy (to wit using gangsta rap over and over to BE FUNNY because the heroes are white (ha! got it!) and go in slo-mo 'hero walks' one too many!

		<fullReview>I don't even want to look at the previous negative comments, they all start in completely the wrong way.. This film is hilarious; full of funny and sometimes strange one-liners and gags... I think the screen writing is often ingenious, and the cast are all pretty amazing. These other reviewers may have been watching a different film... But if not, they need to relax and actually have a bit of fun watching this without being so cynical! ... All-in-all: Love the characters and their actors.__ The screen play is really clever and portrayed really well__ Funny for teens and adults alike!___ I Love this film and will definitely be buying it when it comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pretty Good Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfairly criticized for not being very funny, THE WATCH is, well? not very funny. But it's still a pretty decent and involving movie about a small town four-dude Neighborhood Watch headed by Ben Stiller, who manages the local Costco where the night security guard was killed mysteriously.Stiller's uptight Evan puts out fliers with only three responses: Vince Vaughn's partying single dad Bob; Jonah Hill's edgy wannabe cop Franklin; and Jamarcus, the token oddball played with charming finesse by Richard Ayoade. Stiller takes the straight man mantle to the limit ? he hardly smiles or thinks anything is amusing, especially Bob's constant attempt to win over the crowd (Vaughn revisiting his SWINGERS persona once again).The group has little to do but wait for something to happen until their car crashes into a scary looking beast ? here's where the tables and they soon learn aliens are "all around." A subtle satire on the alien paranoia theme and a buddy flick (Vaughn and Stiller have the best anti-chemistry together), THE WATCH works despite the forced crude humor. Enough happens? including subplots about Evan's marriage and Bob's promiscuous teenage daughter? to keep the viewer entertained.And the direction works best for the suspense scenes involving the aliens lurking in the night, although the CGI laden battles go a bit overboard. Either way, this is a worthwhile time waster with more to offer than punchlines.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Summer Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from a pre-screening of the the film and I went in with rather low expectations. The trailer didn't look good and It seemed like it would just be a deadbeat comedy that lacked laughs. This film is actually one of the funniest i've seen this summer! The cast did a great job in their roles and all of them are really funny! The plot was actually one of the more original ones i've seen in a comedy in a long time which I really enjoyed. The film provides a good amount of laughs as well as some action as well. I was also surprised by how raunchy the film was. Trust me when I say this is a HARD R comedy. There were also more than a few twist in this film that really caught me off guard. Without spoiling anything, I will say that The Watch is one of the funniest movies you will see this year and I highly recommend it! If you thought Ted was funny, you ain't seen nothing yet!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE WATCH': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) 'GHOST BUSTERS' style Sci-Fi/comedy with Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and Richard Ayoade as four suburbanites who form a neighborhood watch group and end up having to defend the world from an alien invasion. The film was originally titled 'Neighborhood Watch' and the original trailers didn't feature the science fiction element to the film at all and instead focused on the four main characters acting like somewhat crazy neighborhood watch guys roughing up kids. After the infamous Trayvon Martin shooting by a crazed and racist neighborhood watch member (George Zimmerman) the film of course had to change it's marketing, to distance itself from that element of the film, and changed the title to just 'THE WATCH' two months before it's release. The last-ditch marketing efforts didn't work though as the film underperformed at the box office greatly. Which is a shame because it's actually a pretty funny movie.Stiller stars as Evan Trautwig, a lonely middle-aged suburbanite with no friends who's constantly joining community programs in order to try and make friends (he's especially interested in befriending as many minorities as he can). He's a senior manager at Costco and has a lovely and beautiful wife named Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt) but recently found out he can't have kids and has been unable to please Abby sexually as a result (or tell her the news). When an employee (Joe Nunez) is brutally murdered he decides to form a neighborhood watch group and attracts the attention of three guys (Vaughn, Hill and Ayoade) looking to party more than anything else. They soon discover the killers they're after are actually aliens and it's up to the four of them to stop them and save the world as the local police, lead by Sgt. Bressman (Will Forte), are no help.The movie was directed by Akiva Schaffer (a 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' writer and director vet who made his feature film debut directing the Andy Samberg vehicle 'HOT ROD') and written by Jared Stern, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. The script probably could have used a few more rewrites as the film feels a little sloppy and unpolished as a whole. The comedy is hit and miss but I'd say more hit than miss for the most part. Stiller gives it his all once again in the lead but playing the straight man, once again as well, does allow his three co-stars to outshine him in the laugh department. Vaughn and Hill pack the movie with their brilliant improvisation skills, sometimes falling a little flat but for the most part delivering. Ayoade gives a star making performance as the fourth lead and probably steals the show when all is said and done. DeWitt shows how sexy and stunning she can be in the movie's token female role and proves herself to be a star to watch. The movie isn't an exceptional comedy by any means and the subject matter is a little untimely at times but it does deliver enough laughs to make it worth while for the most part. If you're a fan of the four leads you're sure to enjoy.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAxZQ69Tess</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where are the Men In Black when you really need them?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Evan(Ben Stiller) organizes a neighborhood watch, after his friend a security guard at a store he manages is murdered, with little help from the police, he recruits for his watch( Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill, and Richard Ayoade) in hopes of catching the killer, but quickly discover that the killer may not be human at all.Although there are some funny moments here, this is still not a good film. The cast can be funny, but the raunchy sex gags felt like they where really getting desperate. But it's nowhere nears as bad as That's My Boy, this could have been good only the jokes didn't feel so forced. The alien comedy is a good idea, and the cast have such good chemistry, but if you are looking for a funnier alien comedy, if Men In black 3 is still out, go see that instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Virtually every scene of this movie is brilliant and funny. It's so funny it made me cry. Just FYI I believe the funniest shows ever are It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Flight of the Conchords, Seinfeld, South Park and The Office which are all top ranked on IMDb so I don't think I have some weird sense of humor.However, the movie also extols the ordinary suburban life of a manager of your regular Tesco-like market. The manager loves his work, his neighborhood and his store. Sure, it's all told in a funny way, but one can clearly see the producers and script writers must have been pretty serious about that. You get hundreds of IMDb rank 1,2,3,4s etc from fashionable capitalism haters just for that alone.Even the very beginning of the movie starts with the outlandish statement that the manager does not give a damn about the whole freaking universe except for his local capitalist neighborhood and his capitalist workplace in a capitalist economy. Later you'll also hear that the Tesco-like market has "all you need", even if you happen to be an alien that wants to conquer the human race.No wonder the movie has so low IMDb rank. I don't really understand why capitalism-haters can't appreciate a good laugh just because a movie extols capitalism. I love American Beauty and Fight Club, some of the best movies of all time, even though their message is pretty much socialist. Why can't the socialists be also tolerant? It's just a comedy, for god's sake (if she or he exists, naturally).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable but still funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a comedy fan sees this preview it sends shivers down their spine: Ben Stiller, Jonah Hill AND Vince Vaughn all in the same movie? Not to mention the English dude that nobody knows, but still: English people are usually hilarious. So when I went to see this movie I had moderate expectations: I had hoped that all the funny portions weren't shown in the previews, that the story wasn't extremely stupid or put together with Elmer's glue, and that the inclusion of "crude but smart" humor wasn't completely misspent. Almost Wedding Crashers style. I wasn't let down, but I wasn't jumping for joy either.What one can ascertain from the preview is that Ben Stiller's character makes a neighborhood watch and then this band of misfits stumbles upon the potential discovery of aliens. Throughout the whole movie there is good, albeit crude, humor. Still humor nonetheless, and you will be laughing for a while. While this movie is not as funny as Wedding Crashers or this summer's comedy blockbuster Ted, it still provides some comic relief for the viewer while maintaining an easy storyline to follow and some relate-able moments that any father, husband and friend can appreciate.What I didn't enjoy about this film was that Vince Vaughn came out of the role he's so firmly planted himself in these past 10 to 15 years. He's always this serious, expression-less character who can make anyone laugh with anything he says. However, he perpetuates a role that is extremely hyper-active and goofy, although still funny. I guess I just missed the Old School type of character he portrayed in the past.Jonah Hill also takes a turn in a different direction, playing a character that is extremely strange and at points, mental. It's not a turn for the worse, just something different. Fair warning, this is not the same Jonah Hill that made Superbad so enjoyable.The plot is simple and easy to follow but is too predictable. Although there are a few twists, they aren't anything major and don't do much to set the plot apart from something that a Joe Blow could make up in his spare time. Everything that happens could be guessed in three tries or less and the end ties everything together in that American-esque way that things these days are so often concluded with.The special effects, although few and far between, are pretty easily recognizable as CGI. A comparable movie would be X-Men Origins: Wolverine. An everyday movie-goer could tell that the special effects in this movie were just that: effects. Too fake.All-in-all, The Watch isn't a bad film and is worth a watch (pardon this atrocious pun). Ben Stiller, Jonah Hill and Vince Vaughn all come together nicely and the addition of Richard Ayoade pulls everything together well; after all, everything's funnier with an English accent.+3 for the comradery between the four main characters+2 for the laughs +1 for simply not being a disappointment</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been waiting for this movie to come out for quite sometime now and was very excited to see it. The movie that i watched was extremely funny at moments but sometimes was quite disgusting and rude. In one instance they refer to the green goo as feeling like cum. That is quite gross and otherwise unneeded in the movie but i was expecting such considering it had Jonah Hill and Vince Vaughn in it.Overall the movie has some unexpected twists good, satisfying ending with some action and laughs. The only drawback was the constant vulgarity so be warned of that if you plan on seeing this but i give it 7/10. Good and Bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jonah Hill gets a ton of screen time and is really great, but Richard Ayoade is just a no fail guy to me. This movie would have been worth the watch without him but with him in it I am going to give it another watch. Also catch him in "The IT crowd," or the brilliant film he directed "Submarine." Yeah I am a fanboy. But the plot isn't super complex but it is pleasant and keeps the jokes rolling and that is what's important for a comedy. NOT FOR KIDS! Saw some kids in the screening, would't allow my kids to see it, but hey not my kids not my responsibility. This movie is best suited for the general 17-35 crowd that won't mind a little potty humor here and there and by "here and there" i mean everywhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came in with pretty low expectations from the overwhelming amount of negative reviews. What I found was a decent summer flick that packed in a good amount of laughs, although the jokes seemed like they were hit-or- miss. The cast played the roles they seem to have played the last decade. Stiller played his generic role of being the boring guy who needs to lighten up. Vaughn played the chatterbox. It always seems like he talks longer the more unfunny the joke is. Hill, as usual, plays the loser. To me, the movie's humor is similar to the Hangover. The movie packs in a lot of body humor (penis, sperm, and condom jokes) as well as having weird characters saying odd things (the cop, the neighbor, and Jamarcus) which is primarily what the Hangover did. Basically, I don't understand the huge gap between the Hangover and this movie. I give this movie a 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Got a chance to check out the movie "The Watch," starring Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill, and Richard Ayoade.Wow, I'm saying "wow" because this movie was different. Overall, I felt like this was a descent film. I liked it and I enjoyed. This film was an entertaining wrecking ball filled with comedy, laughter, and hilarious thrills. This comedic film was so different and that's one of the main reasons I enjoyed this film. Not to mention Ben Stiller, Jonah Hill, and Vince Vaughn is this movie. When I seen that these three guys were in the movie there was no way I wasn't going to see this film. Jonah Hill and Vince Vaughn were the funniest out of the four main characters.Good film, Good acting, crazy plot (loved that about the film), so I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. If you need a good laugh and you're a fan of any of the main characters in this film it would be worth seeing it in the movie theaters. Enjoy the film and I hope you enjoyed the review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not A Bad Watch, But Not Worth The Trip To The Theater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you get when you mix a control freak, a partying father, a rebellious cop wannabe, and an English man with a sexual dream? The answer is the cast for the latest comedy/ sci fi mixture titled the Watch. However, don't let the genre combination fool you as this is not about four big stars taking off into space to have intergalactic adventures. Instead, it's a rag tag bunch of comedians attempting to uncover the truth about aliens in their neighborhood and the struggles they face. Now while this sounds like a horrible and tired plot, 20th century fox has managed to recruit some big named stars to hopefully deliver the laughing punch I've so been looking for. Was the combination of Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill, and Richard Ayoade strong enough to make the movie fun, or has their comedy grown stale and weak. Read on to find out.Let's start by saying that these four stars hunting out aliens in a rural neighborhood is a bit of a stretch and sure to be interesting. However, the shallow plot aside, there were a few deeper and unexpected things that this film had to offer. One of these things just happens to be the amount of gore and bloodiness this movie has to offer. Throughout the entire movie, there are a few rather graphic shots of both aliens and human getting dismembered, which should be a warning for those planning on taking kids. Although the goriness is not the most gruesome, it's still a little shocking to see someone's heart get ripped out of their bodies for this movie. What was even more shocking though was the amount of sexual material present in this film, which I wasn't expecting as much. Most of the jokes, dialog, and language focused on penis, sex, or vagina jokes, which for a sci/fi movie about hunting down aliens is not what comes to mind. While some of the jokes were funny, or the delivery of the jokes, I grew a little bored as the same innuendos were constantly thrown at me. Unfortunately there were also a few times where the staff got a little too carried away with the jokes or mannerisms and really grossed me out. My threshold for sexual comedy is definitely lower, so I'm probably more offended by it, however you have been warned. Perhaps what you shouldn't be surprised by is the foul language that also goes along with the sexual dialog. Like most R movies, the Watch is filled with constant use of the F word. If you haven't been desensitized to that word yet, you'll get closer with this movie as both Hill and Vaughn say it without any limits. The Watch doesn't stop there though, as the writers decided to integrate the M F and C words into the mixture as well, though they haven't quite gotten to the point of Kick-Ass cursing. Again well timed cursing is okay with me, but used in excessive amounts just gets stale, bland, and rather annoying for this reviewer. With the negative surprises aside, let's talk about a few other things I caught in this movie. Like most comedy movies, the trailer can ruin a good amount of comedic genius, and the Watch is no different. The lines that I've seen in the countless trailers were old by the time I saw the film with the only difference being the addition of sexual innuendos and cursing, that were edited out. On the positive side though there were a number of "interesting" and sometimes funny jokes that were not in the trailers. Vaughn and Hill in particular had some ridiculous stunts and lines that were rather funny, and kept my friends and me laughing amongst the sea of drab. What was even funnier for me thought was the way the duo spoke. Fans of Vaughn's loud, crazy, and sporadic rants will be pleased to see him rant like some overgrown juvenile as he explains his philosophies on various problems. Those who liked Jonah Hill in 21 Jump street, will pleased to see his attempts to be cool and tough return once more, though this time he doesn't have to rely on his costars to set him up. Even Ayoade has a few well timed lines and his British accent and new foreign guy story provide some interesting scenarios. Stiller though is still not the funniest guy, only having a few awkward scenes and one hit wonder lines to get the audience laughing. Instead his character is there to kind of keep morals and focus on the mission of the watch and keep the chaotic actions of the Watch at bay. He also helps drive the plot, character, and morals and helps add some emotional depth to the movie to help make more realistic characters, though there is not much focus on this in a comedy. What was the funniest thing for me though were the various movie references that were mentioned in the movie. If you listen closely enough and know your movies you'll find at least four movie references that will make you laugh. The Watch is definitely a typical comedy that has some good chemistry and well delivered lines, however it is still just a mediocre comedy. Fans of crude humor will find the vulgarity very entertaining and will enjoy the hour and half. The chemistry of the team and their diverse backgrounds also help keep things fresh, but not even four pronunciations of the F bomb can keep the word from growing stale. Is it worth a trip to the movies? I say no, but it has Netflix/Redbox potential for later dates. Yet if you have to go see it, well grab your frat brothers or poker buddies, because that's the prime audience. My scores for the films are the following: Sci-Fi/Comedy: 8.0 Movie Overall: 6.5</fullReview>

Now there are some parts in the movie not suitable for children viewing but if they are teenagers take them.I love anything with Vince Vaughn and Jonah Hill .

		<fullReview>I was worried about watching the movie after reading some of the reviews, but this movie was great. you will not last more than 3 straight minutes without laughing at least once. I do agree that maybe the movie would had been a bit funnier if it wasn't about aliens, and instead about real criminals....but the movie was extremely funny, I recommend this movie to everyone (over 15 years of age), I honestly believe that it was one of the funniest movies of the year (yes funnier than Ted). Vince Vaughn always does a great job, so I did not expect anything less than what he did. But his character was one of the best, because even though it was a syfy movie with aliens, his character was realistic and people could relate with him, he was a father who was basically raising his daughter on his own, nd throughout the movie, everything he did was based on her. The new actor Ayoade, was extremely funny, nd he barley did anything lol. His accent was perfect for his role. This movie was a great "comming out" film for him, and he most definitely need to be in more movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To all the moviegoers out there looking for a great escape from reality and a movie full of bellyaching laughs, look no further than "The Watch." The comedy stars Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and Richard Ayoade who form a neighborhood watch to escape their dreadful family lives. They soon discover an alien plot to destroy the world and are forced into action.The movie has a great deal of chemistry from the quartet which works incredibly well on the screen. The audience will believe these guys are pals in real life. The comedic timing in this picture is impeccable. A writer and director could not ask for a better set of guys who just feed off of the other person's energy level. The picture does address suburban life; there's the belief that in suburbia everything is nice and dainty, but things aren't always what they appear to be. People have secrets behind closed doors and the movie brings those things to the forefront.To read the full review, go to: http://www.canyon-news.com/ Be sure to like us on Facebook to get all the latest movie reviews at www.facebook.com/canyon.news.la OR Follow us on Twitter @cnewspaper</fullReview>

Vince Vaughn as Bob, the father of a rebellious teen and wants to party with his new buds. Jonah Hill plays Franklin, the crazy one of the group who failed the written, physical, and mental health tests at the police academy. Finally, we have Jamarcus, a recent divorce. Together, they form a bond a rid the neighborhood of delinquents and aliens from another planet. It was hilarious and awesome to see these guys fight aliens and save the world from extinction.

		<fullReview>The Watch is a fun exciting movie that balances itself well with having raunchy laughs and the right amount of heart. You buy into the characters and their journeys and root for them as they take on the aliens. The acting is hilarious, Jonah Hill supplies a ton of laughs. Also Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller play opposite each other nicely. The story is never boring and has action drama and suspense under the same roof. Each character has their own specific arc that together work towards a greater whole for the group.There are twists in the story that leave you pleasantly surprised and the heroes face a legitimate threat while working through their personal issues. If you are looking for a fun movie, see this. It is as good as 21 Jump Street and one of the best comedies I have seen in a while.9/10</fullReview>

We have aliens, non-stop phallic humor, orgies, Vince and Ben at their finest in years, green goo, excellent shooting location (hey, they shot much of this in My home town so what's not to love)?

		<shortDescription>The Watch is on patrol</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sci-fi genre is a pretty hard one to get right and more often than not the hundreds of films that come along manage to completely miss the mark. With the latest The Watch, previously titled Neighborhood Watch, they tackle the sci-fi genre, but from a buddy comedy aspect to create something different. While the trailers looked average at best, but with the cast of Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and Richard Ayoade it has the potential to really deliver something fun and entertaining. Can they take these two genres slammed together by this funny cast manage to pull this off or will it end up being just another invasion gone horribly wrong. The Watch follows four guys that form a neighborhood watch to get away from their boring daily lives. This seemingly unadventurous job takes a wild turn when they discover that the town is being invaded by aliens. Now, they must ban together to save their neighborhood and the world from extermination. What could have easily been an average comedy ended up being so much more thanks to the brilliantly executed dialogue by the cast. Everyone here really stepped up their game delivering some extremely hilarious moments that will keep you laughing throughout most of the film. Jonah Hill keeps getting stronger and throwing his off the wall character alongside Vaughn's quick wit delivery and Stiller's every man innocence just enhances it all that more. Richard Ayoade who isn't getting all that much of a push in the trailers due to being the lesser known of the bunch not only carries his own, manages to deliver some of the funniest lines. The story itself is pretty simple with a few twists here and there, but really relies on the chemistry between all the actors involved. This is a rated R comedy wrapped in a sci-fi buddy action film with just a touch of heart to make it have a bit more depth. A lot of times in these comedy sci-fi films, they go for the comedic look of the alien as well for laughs, but here they delivered a pretty cool alien and use mostly practical effects and the great Doug Jones to bring it alive. There is some CGI and it is only enhanced by the practical effects that seem to be getting used sparingly these days. This was way funnier than the trailers let on thanks to a smart cast that not only work well together, but seem to be having a great time while doing it. This is the clever sci-fi comedy mash that fans have been wanting and will surely please. If you're a fan of the genre, any or the entire cast then you have to go check this film out. Besides, it's not often these days you get such a fun clever movie that isn't a sequel, prequel, or remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent movie, with four high-profiled celebrities which are super hilarious. I just watched the pre-screening for this movie, I recommend it to teenagers and adults. Its a great laugh the whole way through, not just from myself but many of people in the same cinema. ITS A MUST WATCH! Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller play their role in the movie of ordinary suburban extremely well and Jonah Hill is just the funniest character and cracks the funniest one liners the whole way through the movie. Watch this, you will not be disappointed and supposedly up in the funniest comedies in 2012. Enjoy.</fullReview>
