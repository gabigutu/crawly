		<shortDescription>Nice looking, but hollow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first third of Dreamcatcher is worth the time. Four childhood friends make their annual trip to a hunting cabin, weird things happen, and, before you know it, you're smack-dab in the world of Stephen King, at his most darkly comical and gaily grotesque. It's flatulent, bloody fun on the page, and Goldman had no problem translating this hideous orgy of gas and guts from novel to screenplay form. As the screenplay proceeds, it strays from the book to the point where the film becomes a Hollywood embarrassment of epic proportions.The Dreamcatcher novel also fell apart in its second half, but what kept you reading the book was the mind games going on in the lead character, Jonesy's (Damian Lewis) head. Jonesy's brain and body has been taken hostage by an alien named, Mr. Gray. In the novel, Jonesy notices Gray becoming tempted by the trappings of humanity, and uses that to his advantage. It's fun to watch the alien craving various human indulgences, more and more, with each passing minute. This aspect of the novel is completely removed from the film, leaving us with nothing more than Damian Lewis, playing both Jonesy and Mr. Gray, making silly faces, and putting on goofy accents, as he goes between the two characters.The second act of the film, one taking place in a concentration camp for American citizens whom may or may not be contaminated with an alien virus, is nothing more than a shadow of what is shown in the book. Even the shoddiest of cliffnote "authors" would be embarrassed to condense a novel down to this elementary a form.In the book, the head of the camp, Colonel Abraham Kurtz, played in the film by Morgan Freeman, was a nasty man, so over the edge that he was frightening, from his first appearance to his last. In the movie, we're made aware of the fact that he has lost it, but almost exclusively through exposition, rather than action. Seeing these innocent civilians locked up like animals was disturbing in the novel, and would make for an extremely tense mid-section of this movie, if this movie dared to have any tension.In King's Dreamcatcher, the people locked in the camps join together, with help from the telepathic Dr. Henry Devlin, in the film played by Thomas Jane, and start a massive uprising against the guards. At the same time, Devlin is working on Colonel Kurtz's more conscientious subordinates, both through words, and the power that he, along with Jonesy, Beaver and Pete, was given by a mysterious fifth friend, Duddits. In the movie, the uprising never occurs, and it feels as though each of the concentration camp scenes were put into the film to pad it out, while giving a plum role to Morgan Freeman.I won't give away the finale to either the novel or the film, but I will say that everything good about the finish of the book form of Dreamcatcher, is noticeably missing from the film version. Instead of an emotionally moving climax, we get a sloppy CGI-fest that reminded me a bit of Godzilla VS. King Kong, or maybe even Species 2. Although I found myself squirming over the laziness displayed during the majority of the second half of the picture, I was still undecided as to whether or not I would recommend it. The lousy last few minutes of film made up my mind.This is the first movie I can think of that I can only recommend in patches. Drink a couple of gallons of water before you attend the picture, and run to the bathroom to let it out, whenever things start getting stupid.If you're a fan of horror, you will enjoy the first hour of the film. The bathroom sequence is a near-masterpiece, and, for that alone, Lawrence Kasdan should be commended. Kasdan also handles the flashback scenes, featuring the four main characters as children, adequately enough to get my thumb working its way toward the "up" direction. Finally, during those few times Kasdan does take us into Jonesy's brain, he does so in an incredibly interesting, oftentimes humorous, manner.When Jonesy leaves the relative safety of the locked room he has nuzzled deep within his cerebrum, only to find the evil that is hiding behind boxes of stored memories inside his mind's warehouse, it genuinely gave me chills. More scary moments like this, placed throughout the film, and Kasdan may have had his first instant classic in a long while.There was a lot of money and time put into Dreamcatcher, and it shows on the screen. Steve Johnson's work on the puppet versions of the "s***weasels" is extremely effective, and shows, once again, that anything CG can do, human hands can do better. The CG isn't the best I've seen, but it's significantly less cartoony than either of the last two Star Wars prequels, and does the job nicely, even though I would have enjoyed the effects far more, if CG wasn't a part of them. The cinematography by John Seale (The English Patient, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Witness) is gorgeous, but not noteworthy enough to make the Director of Photography the star of the film, like Caleb Deschanel's work did for him in the recent semi-stinker, The Hunted.What we end up with is a nice looking film that feels hollow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! Now that's a crazy movie!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, where does Stephen King comes up with this things? Again, we have the childhood friends we think we know from "Stand by me" only this time they're older, have weird powers and face some really nasty creatures. I just come from watching it for the first time and i just wanted to say: What a weird movie!! I've seen some really weird movies, but this one... It's sort of a mixture of horror, sci-fi, comedy... At some point you don't know whether to be disgusted or to laugh! The special efects are great, and so is the music ("On blue bayou..."}. It may not be a great movie, but it's great entertainment. And it's sooooooo insane!!!! I liked it. Go see it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a failure, but a truly magnificent one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Stephen King fans should probably know, there are a lot of things in Stephen Kings books that make sense only where they are - that is, in Stephen King books. Translating them to film is usually a bad idea, as many filmmakers who had adapted King's books before probably figured out. But along comes Lawrence Kasdan, a talented and acclaimed veteran director, who, with the aid of a no less acclaimed screenwriter William Goldman, decides while writing a script for Dreamcathcer that it would be better to bring along all the trademark King's weird goings-on - and voila! We have a movie filled with telepathy, butt-ripping aliens, crazy military types keen on killing everyone, telephone-guns, indian symbols and even a lot of CGI thrown in for a good measure. Of course, it all fails - but oh how gloriously! I'll go as far as to state that Dreamcatcher is absolutely the best unintentional B-movie trashfest in years! It was totally amusing that such a bunch of undoubtedly talented people (Morgan Freeman, Tom Sizemore, Thomas Jane, besides aforementioned Kasdan &amp; Goldman) were able to make this film without a single smirk - while the material is pure trash'n'cheese. That was the whole beauty of it, for me, at least - the level of money, work and talent that went into creating this film. I would like to personally thank all the people involved with Dreamcathcer - they made my year! Thank you, Lawrence Kasdan! Thank you, William Goldman! Thank you, Morgan Freeman - your eyebrows rocked! And most of all, thank you, Jason Lee - the bathroom scene involving Beaver and an alien worm under the toilet lid is pure classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a masterpiece but enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually liked Dreamcatcher enough that I saw it twice. However, this may be mostly due to the fact that I really liked Jason Lee as Beaver and Timothy Olyphant as Pete. Regardless, this was actually a movie I did enjoy seeing.I was not particularly interested in seeing Dreamcatcher initially. And this is me, who wants to see every scary movie. Not Scream type horror, but certainly of the creepy not entirely natural variety: Ring, Resident Evil (is that even horror?), you get the idea. However, my sister and her friend convinced me to go. After seeing an interview with Jason and some video clips from the movie, I was actually more enthusiastic.Part of the reason I did enjoy the movie is because of the younger era flashbacks of the four friends. It had a kind of supernatural stand by me feel to it for those scenes, and I'm quite a fan of Stand By Me so that appealed to me. It also appealed to me because it did seem like a nice jump-out-and-scare-you horror. It's no psychological thriller which relies on your own imagination to scare you (and the fear stays with you well after you're done seeing it). It's much more blood and gore and chase the monster down kind of fun, which thrills you while you watch. I just love horror movies - any kind.Also, I think that the movie did manage to get you to like most of these characters. Beaver was just loveable off the bat because of his "beaverisms" and his general charm. (I think Lee did a great job). Timothy Olyphant's character was also likeable (whether or not that it attributed to his acting skill, I don't know. I'm a horrible judge of acting, so I could say good but not really know the difference.) But I think his introduction scene worked well to help you connect to him despite his limited screen time (compared to the other "main" characters).Thomas Jane and Damian Lewis were well enough. I don't think I grew particularly attached to either of their characters - Jonesy or Henry. And I'm sorry but the whole "british" Mr. Gray really threw me. It seemed so oddly thrown in - Why would an Alien speak with a British Accent? I realize on some level it was to draw a distinction, but still.Morgan Freeman, I love him. I can't be unbiased about his role, because I just love him too much. I also liked Tom Sizemore, or at least his character was very likeable. And talk about creepy: "No infection here." stuff.The effects were well done (I think) and I liked the soundtrack. That opening main theme, I want it! It was great and creepy and mysterious. I think the composer was the same guy who did the theme music for Unbreakable and Signs, and well, I like those too.What can I say? The show entertained me. Maybe it's not a masterpiece but I think it was money well spent. I wasn't bored at any time. I was interested in how everything came about. I can completely see why those who read the book first would be disappointed. I read the Harry Potter books prior to seeing the movies and I hate every change they made - and that movie is always said to be so faithful. So I can see people's issues with the end and other changes.I think a lot of the other reasons people dislike the movie is that it does have a lot of different ideas coming together. I read a review critiquing it's various directions, but honestly, I think all the different pieces come together fine as a cohesive whole. I understood the storyline and I wasn't jarred by flashbacks or scene changes. To me, it flowed, made sense. I could connect the dots easily enough.And hell, if that ripley red-fungus s*** isn't enjoyably disgusting, I don't know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films of all-time (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If movies have taught me one thing it's that aliens are obsessed with the human anus. They cross galaxies to probe and explore it. What mysteries lie up there?? But Dreamcatcher goes one step further. These aliens aren't merely obsessed with exploring the rectum; they hide up it. It should be a shock, but aliens have been crawling out of my colon for years? Dreamcatcher gets off to a reasonable enough start. We get a nice little sequence where we're introduced to the four main characters and their respective powers ? they're telepathic. Then we get a bit of King-style strangeness when one of the characters gets run over. So far so good. The man survives and then we get a pleasant sequence in a log cabin where the friends talk, joke and give thanks to the kid that gave them their strange gifts. It's here that the film begins to go downhill. We get a Stand by Me-style flashback to their childhood where the four friends save a half-wit from a couple of bullies who want to make him eat faeces. It's not a terrible scene, but the kids come over as insufferable do-gooders. The fact that they're fans of Scooby-Doo speaks volumes. But they save the half-wit, a kid called Duddits (is it law that movie half-wits have to be infuriatingly lovable?) and he gives them all sorts of gnarly powers. It's not a great sequence, but the film is still chugging along.The film derails, though, when we go back to the log cabin and the adult characters. Jonesy (Damien Lewis) stumbles upon a man lost in the snow. The stranger's not feeling too well and he's got a strange red mark on his face, so Jonesy gives him shelter. The man is grateful but he keeps on farting. Then Beaver, played by Jason Lee, stumbles into the cabin and the two friends have to put up with the noxious fumes. To cut a long story short the two friends then give the bloke a place to sleep but he ends up dying on the toilet. You see, this is what happens when aliens invade. They find a nice warm place in your colon and then you die on the bog when they want some fresh air.The scene that follows is laughable. The two friends have the alien trapped in the toilet (it can't get out while the fat bloke is sitting on the khazi) but somehow Beaver ends up sitting on the closed toilet lid instead. Jonesy then decides that it's a good idea to get some tape from the shed to keep the lid shut, so he leaves Beaver alone on the lav. It's kind of like Lethal Weapon 2, only with an alien instead of a bomb. But to show how stupid the film is, Beaver is wrested from his safe position because for some reason he wants a toothpick to keep him calm (is he Razor Ramon?). Personally I'd be more worried about my bum. But the alien gets loose and kills poor Beaver right before Jonesy's eyes (Jonesy takes an age to find the tape).But what of the alien? What does it look like? Well, it's worm in shape but it has a mouth like a tooth-filled vagina. I'll get onto my interpretation of this in a moment? But the worm isn't the real alien. The real alien confronts Jonsey a few moments later. It's a CGI monstrosity and is kind of a human-shaped blob. But then after it stares at Jonesy it seems to explode in front of his face. I was puzzled for a moment or two but then it's revealed that the alien has possessed him. And how does the alien speak? Why, it speaks in an English accent, of course! Pip-pip, old chap! But the Gollum-like scenes where the real Jonesy and the camp English alien Jonesy talk to one another are hilarious. I kept wondering whether it was a joke. Surely such assured filmmakers couldn't make such a grave miscalculation. But apparently they could, because the film only gets increasingly stupid.Another brilliantly dumb scene is when another one of the friends is stuck in the snow with some beer. He gets a little bit drunk and needs to urinate. So he's relieving himself, and writing a boy's name into the snow ('Duddits'), when one of the alien worms leaps out and bites his penis off. And this brings me onto my interpretation of the alien invasion (as its never explained). My theory is that a race of self-hating, gay, English aliens (there's no way alien Jonesy can be straight) are trying to kill Earth's homosexual population ? none of the friends are married and one is rather fond of talking about his privates. And to do their bidding they have teeth-filled vagina worms to bite off the genitalia of any man who isn't 100% straight. Hey, it makes as much sense as the rest of the movie! Adding credence to this far-fetched theory is Morgan Freeman's character. He and his second-in-command, Tom Sizemore (who are the gay military men trying to stop the gay alien invasion), spend a lot of time giving one another flirty glances. And Freeman's character has a John Wayne pistol, Dennis Healy eyebrows and talks of crap weasels. And the two men also end up killing one another. This scene is certainly one of the funniest. It's Tom Sizemore versus Morgan Freeman, only Freeman has a helicopter (with the most phallic mini-gun known to man attached to the nose) and Sizemore has a pistol. Who do you reckon wins? Man in helicopter? Or man on foot with a pistol? Why, the man on foot wins! It doesn't make any sense. But then again none of the film does. It's a Byzantine puzzle that begins with bums and ends with dumbness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice start... but then things go terribly wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts very interesting and then, around the arrival of Morgan Feeman, becomes almost total crap. What I thought was going to be a supernatural thriller, the way it started, turns out to be a silly sci-fi horror almost as bad as the Stephen King adaptation of 'Sleepwalkers', just to name one.May be it is very hard to make a good Stephen King adaptation when it involves creatures not from this earth, or in a different time, or et cetera. 'The Langoliers' is another great example of something that starts very interesting and once those monsters appear becomes something stupid. There it took a while for them to appear, here we are only at a quarter of the movie.The interesting supernatural part I was talking about involves the four friends Henry, Beaver, Jonesy and Pete. As kids they meet the mentally retarded Duddits, who seems to have supernatural powers and passes some of them to the four friends. As adults (they are played by Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Damian Lewis and Timothy Olyphant) they still have the powers and that is where the movie begins. They have telepathic gifts; they know things from strangers and are able to have contact with each other without speaking, and this is demonstrated with the great opening scenes.When the four friends go to the woods for some hunting things go wrong. With them, and the movie. I will not tell you what happens exactly because you can guess by then. The movie never gets scary or interesting after the opening scenes again. For me the only thing I could enjoy from there was snow falling from the sky and performances that were alright. With two hours and ten minutes the movie is way too long and with a something this stupid and predictable you can only waste your time. Read the book and make your own version instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never read the book, I have only read a small handful of Stephen King's works ... they're generally not my preferred genre. I could go on here, but I don't think most of you care if you are reading this.Okay, I liked the movie. I would rate it around 7 or 8 for sheer entertainment factor. Sure, there were a few scenes that were a little thin, there were a few elements of dialogue (sp: I'm Canadian, eh?) that were a little weak. But since I didn't even know this was a SK movie, I had absolutely no predisposition regarding this movie.In fact, I hadn't even reviewed any of the synopses or shorts regarding this film ... I was totally green going into it. And I found myself highly entertained. I liked seeing a bunch of characters whom I am not entirely familiar with, and I appreciated the casting of a few well-knows.Enjoyment: 8 Cast: 8 Acting: 6 for some, 7 or 8 for others. Dialogue: 6 in general CGI: 7 (pretty good, but lots of 'off screen' stuff) Overall: 7</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a sci-fi fan, but am pretty discriminating. Often _years_ will go by where I don't like even a single sci-fi film that comes out. This one scared and "wow-ed" me. Doesn't just rely on special effects, but has a good plot and at least decent acting. I don't see why this film was rated so poorly, unless other viewers didn't know ahead of time it had a strong sci-fi bent (I didn't). Great storyline, eerie memorable scenes, and a complex background story that evolves slowly but consistently throughout the movie through flashbacks from the main characters. Great way to condense the novel, I assume.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read Dreamcatcher and think it is one of King's most under-appreciated books. In an interview, King said his wife didn't care for it. King wrote it out on a yellow legal pad while he was recovering from getting hit by that van.I have also listened to the audio version of Dreamcatcher, so all that remained for me was to see this movie. While I knew there were things in the book that probably wouldn't make it to the screen, I was pleasantly surprised by how many did. However some scenes were so brief they were little more than tributes.The cinematography was beautiful from start to finish, but where the first half of the film felt paced to perfection, the last half felt rushed. The ending was different than the book, so be prepared for a shocker.The acting was good, I particularly enjoyed Jason Lee as Joe 'Beaver' Clarenden and Damian Lewis as Gary 'Jonesy' Jones.A real disappointment was Thomas Jane as Dr. Henry Devlin. Pretty woody acting there.Before seeing this movie, I would not have believed that Morgan Freeman could play Kurtz. I was wrong. That guy can play anything. Unfortunately, He didn't get enough chances to flesh out this crazy S.O.B.Jonsey's dual nature was handled differently in the movie than it was in the book. Too bad. It was just right in the book, and was given a more "Hollywood" treatment in the movie.Note to the director: This movie failed because not enough time was spent introducing these characters and making us care about them. The notable exceptions to this where Jonesy and the Beav.Remember: SSDD.No Bounce, No Play.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot heavy--TOO heavy--horror sci-fi film about 4 friends (Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Timothy Olyphant, Damian Lewis) in the Maine woods squaring off against disgusting killer aliens and the Army led by Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore.The film is well-directed by Lawrence Kasdan and well-acted (especially by Jane, Lewis and Olyphant) but there's too many plots going on and the movie rambles on for 135 minutes. I did sit through the whole thing, but I was never really involved or interested.On the plus side, the special effects are great; the aliens are slimy and disgusting; the attack scenes are brutal (and bloody) and I LOVED the way Kasdan visualized Lewis' mind.Still, the film has too many plots to handle and it's constantly loosing its focus. Not terrible or unwatchable, just disappointing.I give it a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreamcatcher: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When John Grisham or Stephen King writes a book, everyone can expect it to be turned into some sort of movie that's not as good (the only one that hasn't had that happen to it is the latter's Insomnia-and it really deserves to be made into something great) as the book was. Of course, there's exceptions (such as The Shining and Carrie-both of which were poorly remade), but one that makes the book look like string cheese is Dreamcatcher. The book was 1000 pages of hit-or-miss horror, and the movie condenses it into two and a quarter hours that takes most of the best parts from the book. Having doubted William Goldman's ability since Marathon Man and the partial butchering of Misery, but since he's writing here with director Lawrence Kasdan, he can't foul up that badly.The hardest part of having the arduous task of adapting a King book is taking 1000+ pages and putting it into a reasonable amount of time for the viewer. That's why the miniseries are always hot to trot, because they can stretch things out to the length of the book. Trouble is, eventually, it gets boring and too true to the book. That's how the aforementioned remakes failed. Filmmakers need to be able to have creative licenses, and that's what Kasdan does. He knows how to work with the material that he and Goldman wrote, and it turns out to be something much better than the source material.Four childhood friends, Beaver (Jason Lee), Henry (Thomas Jane), Jonesy (Damian Lewis) and Pete (Timothy Olyphant), go to some woods in Maine for their annual hunting trip. In their childhood, they had been united by a mentally retarded friend, Duddits (Donnie Wahlberg), which linked all of them with some sort of telepathy that they usually don't talk about. During their twentieth year of going out there, aliens land nearby and alter the course of their lives forever. Meanwhile, Col. Abraham Curtis (Morgan Freeman, with the named changed from the original Kurtz, a reference to Apocalypse Now, because I guess hearing a name will automatically trigger the "plagiarism" sensor in viewer's minds more than reading it) is in charge of the governmental side of the aliens, while he supposedly goes crazy. For those who thought Jack Nicholson's transformation in The Shining happened too quickly, they obviously haven't seen Dreamcatcher.I think the reason most people didn't like Dreamcatcher is that they didn't know what the hell was going on. I can understand it, since some of the most important stuff is just referenced in passing (such as most things relating to Mr. Gray). I thought that all of the Curtis subplot seemed to drag everything down, because everything that's done there could have been brought about some other way. But much of the movie is pretty scary, despite the absurdity of not only some of the aliens and the CGI, but the ending. I didn't have that many qualms with it, but those who did probably also complained with the oddity of the ending of The Hulk (understandably). The plot held up through all of the reductions, and makes an effectual, creepy film.The acting, however, could have been better. Although Jason Lee is always good, all of his catchphrases that his character had in the book seemed scripted and stilted. The actor who played Beaver as a child also seemed to just be reading his lines. The other actors don't really bring any personality to their roles, although Lewis's "dual role" was pretty cool. There seems to be an overwhelming amount of material in this film, but when you think about it, it all flows together pretty well. And considering you're taking 1000 pages into a 135 page script, that's pretty good to have everything flow together. My respect for William Goldman has come back, as for good horror films. Dreamcatcher is not the best King adaptation, or the best King book, but it's entertaining and creepy, and that's all we ask for from Mr. King.My rating: 7/10Rated R for violence, gore and language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DREAMCATCHERDirector: Lawrence Kasdan, Writers: William Goldman and Lawrence Kasdan, Starring: Morgan Freeman as Kurtz, Thomas Jane as Henry, Donnie Wahlberg as Dudits,Rating: 4/4`Dreamcatcher' works on so many different levels. It works great as a drama, as a comedy, as an action film, and as a horror film. I'm a big fan of Stephen King's novels and I'm pleased that `Dreamcatcher' is a faithful adaptation, unlike `The Shining' and `Apt Pupil.' There's a whole lot going on in this film so without ruining anything I'll tell you the basics: four boys were given telepathic powers by a young mentally retarded boy named Dudits. Now they're grown ups and they are spending a weekend in a cabin in a snowy area. What they don't know is that the area they're in a weird disease is loose. The disease is really started by an alien that goes through your body and out your ass. Yuck. The guys have to band together to use their telepathic powers to save the world. I wouldn't want to tell anymore or I'd give a lot of it away.I'm really ticked that every freaking critic out there is giving this film a bad wrap. Of course, it's a sick and disgusting freak show with aliens crawling out of peoples asses, but that's what I liked about this film. It's a drama that doesn't give a crap about showing too much violence or gore. The movie is what it wants to be. The first half of the movie is a good drama then the second half is a blood and gore fiesta! I really liked the dark and scary tone. The camera work was excellent and so was the lighting. I really liked the subplot with Dudits. Dudits rocks! Director Lawrence Kasdan does a great job at showing us what an alien invasion. I also thought Kasdan and Goldman created a great script and faithful adaptation. Goldman did adapt two other of King's books: `Hearts in Atlantis,' and `Misery.' Everyone in this film does a great acting job. Freeman was really convincing as a crazed 'alien-hunter.' The four guys were all convincing as best buds. I really felt a connection between them all. One of my favorite actors, Tom Sizemore, does some of his best work here, and Donnie Wahlberg also does magnificent as a mentally retarded man. I actually felt sorry for him. So if you like horror films so see this movie. For some reason I don't think it'll be as good on the small screen when it comes to DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many genres mixed together.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mix of horror, thriller, spectacular science fiction and realistic science-fiction is not balanced very well and makes it confusing to see what you are actually watching.The movie is interesting in the beginning but after about an hour the movie goes wild and all of the sudden we get a whole different story and movie. I don't blame the directing, I blame the story. The movie also leaves more question than answers.And what was Morgan Freeman doing in this? Don't be fooled people, his role is actually a fairly small one. Come to think of it, his role was an totally unnecessary one. Also Tom Sizemore seemed to be walking around in this movie without having any idea what he was doing.The movie had quite some potential but the execution of it is sloppy. The movie also fails to get scary and tense, instead the scene's get more comical in a way. Even though the movie is about 135 minutes long, it still feels short and very rushed, probably because there are too many story lines going on at once. Also the ending was quite disappointing.Certainly watchable because of the directing, cinematography, special effects and soundtrack but it's not a must see.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MAGIC RETARDS FROM OUTER SPACE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie marks the beginning of a new era of `B' movies. `B' movies are the old fashioned, corny as heck sci fi horror movies from the late 1950's and 1960's. I am talking about movies such as `IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE' or even `PLAN 9 FROM OUTERSPACE' or any of those super cheesy, awful sci movies. This movie should have been called `THE MAGIC RETARD FROM OUTER SPACE.' Because, mainly, that is what was about, and I believe the screenwriter was definitely mentally impaired.My first complaint is somewhat technical and I want to comment on the essence of drama, which is conflict. If you have a scene, there must be conflict, or there is no scene. This movie lacked SCENES! This movie is FILLED with excessive expository dialogue, and it is totally PAINFUL to watch. Expository dialogue is what you see in the soap operas. This is when the writer does not know how to tell his story, so he just has the characters talk in such a way as to simply TELL the audience what is going on. The prime example is the `scene' with Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore when they explain directly to the audience who they are, `the blue men' a bunch of super elite commandos who will shoot each other in the hand for lying. Also, more expository dialogue wallpapers this movie as ALL of the characters babble on CONSTANTLY even when they are alone. They talk to themselves, and conveniently narrate what is happening in the movie.These are all signs of an AMATURE scriptwriter. This amazes me, because these problems are commonly known in Hollywood, and production studios hire people with Masters Degrees in film whose job it is to look through scripts prior to production and look for these problems. When these problems are found, the script is either rejected or rewritten. Who is the dunce that greenlighted this pile of crap?OK, so now about the movie. Magic retards from outer space, giant penis creatures that slither or walk with weird legs and come out of people's butts, an Alien being that possesses it's victims and forces them to argue with themselves in a bad English accent, giant mutant eyebrows on Morgan Freeman, and an alien infection that causes extreme flatulence.Also, the movie has a few flash back `scenes' that return to the four character's boyhood adventures. These `scenes' are PARTICULARY bad! The dialogue is HORRIBLE, as I mentioned before, and the circumstances are totally ridiculous. The acting is REALLY, REALLY BAD! I have seen children act before, and they can be good. But, they did not have much to work with in the way of the script. It was incredibly bad!One other `scene' that was particularly annoying was when Dr. Henry takes the psychic telephone call on the hand gun. Yes, you read that right, on a hand gun. He is holding a hand gun when his psychic friend calls him telepathically. He holds the GUN up to his ear like a phone and has a corny conversation with Jonesy. It is REALLY stupid, and the actor was obviously thinking `what the hell am I doing? This is stupid!'The scene in the cabin when the monster first attacks is pretty good. The monster looks pretty menacing and I liked the tension they created. But this is THE ONLY scene like this in the movie. And the whole bit with the guy reaching for the toothpick was really stupid. Why did he HAVE to have that toothpick at that moment? Was it really worth giving up his life so he could chew on a stupid toothpick? That was bad.One more complaint: Just so you know, Dreamcatchers have NOTHING to do with this movie. Except for the fact that they have one hanging in the cabin overhead. I was shocked this movie was called DREAMCATCHER.Overall, I hated this movie and I recommend you avoid it at all costs. I like good `B' movies. I hate to compare this to `IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE,' because that movie was actually enjoyable. It had that old, classic sci fi `B' movie quality that is really fun to enjoy. And, maybe, in fifty years, this movie will have a similar appeal. I recommend that you wait at least fifty years before viewing this terrible movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Authentic Salad of Science-Fiction and Horror Genres</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Henry Devlin (Thomas Jane), Joe 'Beaver' Clarenden (Jason Lee), Gary 'Jonesy' Jones (Damian Lewis) and Pete Moore (Timothy Olyphant) are best friends since they were kids. They have a powerful telepathic power, given by their weird friend Douglas 'Duddits' Cavell (Donnie Wahlberg). Every year, they join each other in the mountains in Iowa for hunting. While waiting for Pete and Henry, Beaver and Jonesy help a wounded stranger, with farting problems, and lodge him in their cottage. Further, they see helicopters in the sky, and animals very afraid leaving the area. Meanwhile, Henry and Pete have a car accident caused by a wounded woman on the road full of snow. Pretty soon they realize what is happening in that region. This film has a very interesting and intriguing beginning, recalling an X-Files episode. However, in the middle of the plot, it becomes an authentic `salad' of science fiction and horror genres, with ET's, monsters, lunatics and bizarre characters and many clichés. There are some scenes that happen without any further explanations. For example, why Dr. Henry tries to commit suicide in the very beginning of the story? How a leader can shot the hand of his man, like the crazy Col. Abraham Curtis (Morgan Freeman) does with one of his soldier, without any consequences? Why the team of friends apparently had not visited Duddits along all those years? What is the relationship of the powerful retarded Duddits and Mr. Gray? How could such a powerful ET be so easily destroyed? Why such a difficult to plant a worm in the water reservoir having such a spacecraft and being so powerful? Anyway, if the viewer do not think too much, this movie may be a reasonable entertainment for affectionate in sci-fi, horror and Stephen King stories like me. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): `O Apanhador de Sonhos' (`The Dreamcatcher')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Works well as a film, even with some serious problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible spoilers.I consider most films of Stephen King's work junk. Although I like Dreamcatcher a lot, I believe its weaknesses are essentially Stephen King's as a writer:1) flashbacks that rationalize everything in the main characters' lives in terms of a single pivotal childhood encounter or pact (occasionally intriguing, but basically lazy comic book gimmick writing -- events over a period of three years defining a character's later life and personality would take too much work and insight, I guess);2) an almost fetishistic level of reference to the everyday. It's meant to make the experience seem more grounded in the real, I know, but it ultimately comes off too labored and troweled-on to escape transparency of purpose -- like real life written about by someone who has studied it as a second language, and not lived it;3) glimmers of an odd bathroom-based perspective on life that informs not just the humor, which one might expect from an arrested adolescent's pen, but the horror and drama as well (King has said, possibly more than once, that creativity is like a trip to the bathroom, and in saying it he waxed unfortunately specific. Those who've heard or read this most dress-down of all comments on the creative process will no doubt be reminded of the author's comment a few times during Dreamcatchers unwinding).Still, in spite of these serious territorial inadequacies, Dreamcatcher works. It scares and unsettles, expertly at times.There is gushing organic gore galore that reminds you of Alien by-way-of a Fear Factor eating segment. In a gesture of dark humor, the films unappetizing CGI monsters are treasures of nihilistic/sophomoric rude humor, like a ripping belch and belly scratch at the banquet table or posh gallery opening. If you have any will to tweak the status quo, any leanings either anti-authoritarian or anti-joe sixpack (again, like an arrested adolescent), these monsters have to work for you. --The more so because they appear as great levelers, attacking all people in their most give-me-some-privacy moment. But good as the too-graphic stuff is, there's about equally an atmosphere of isolated desperation in a frozen wasteland that is fresh out of Carpenter's remake of The Thing. The milieu generates its own gloomy yet adrenal sense of something immense and terrible on the way, and it is the higher parallel road the film travels. It's to Dreamcatchers credit that while the makers lose sight of this higher trail occasionally, they always seem to find their way back to it. One could easily ruin a couple of great moments with overly enthusiastic synopsizing, but I refuse to play that. Let's just say some small and simple moments work extraordinarily well here. It's rare to be able to say that about a big blowout monster SFX flick. But at it's finest, Dreamcatcher has moments of subtle chill that are as powerful and adroitly handled as those in The Ring or In the Mouth of Madness. That's saying something.The profanity is laid on triple-thick in Dreamcatcher. And while I wouldn't normally single out language, I do so for one reason here. I have seen films about pimps, drug dealers, crooked cops, career military men and serial killers with far less profanity and lewd sexual reference than is spouted about every third word here. I consider this evidence of adherence on the part of the films makers to the forth great King-based flaw:4) King is generally weak on dialog. He lards in the dirty talk, like a rank tyro, to convince us that we are seeing something real. Truth is, real talk lies at a near point between what we hear in King, and in real life. In the context of this film, and a lot of King's work, the profanity and sex talk achieves the opposite of the intended effect: it lends a stiltedness to the dialog by calling so much attention to itself. This is the opposite of the way talk was used in the groundbreaking but likewise often profane Pulp Fiction. Dreamcatchers main characters have a shared pet bad word--"BLANK BLANK banana"-- that they blurt out every couple of sentences. As a repeated phrase, it is jarring, and makes no sense either in context or by itself. The introduction of this phrase sounds, as does so much in King, like the work of a freshman who has taken too much to heart some writing class caveat or other. (In this case, one that says absolutely everybody talks in a singular, eccentric way-- and that it is the writer's duty to discover each persons speech patterns. --A standard theory, but the very theory that wrecks the 'reality' of a lot of the talk in Dreamcatcher.)Lucky for us, the gut-wrenching, ghostly goings on in the film overcome the silly, studied blank-verse artificiality that often plagues the words. Just this once, a really bad-taste monster, and killer production design, may have saved a picture.Yes, it tries to do too much. Yes, it spits out going-nowhere subplots like a machine gun. Yes, it makes little sense at times. But if you ask "Did it scare you or put you at the edge of your chair or enthrall you?" I have to tell you it did, and frequently. Seven and a half of ten stars. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great start, decent middle, poor ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher is a Stephen King adaptation about four psychic friends - Jonesy (Damian Lewis of Band of Brothers fame), Harry (Thomas Jane), Beaver (Jason Lee) and Pete (Tymothy Oliphant) - who use their powers to fight malevolent alien entities and also a special military unit led by crazy Colonel Curtis (Morgan Freeman).The movie starts with effective scenes introducing the main characters, continues with a few ominous sequences in a snowy forest. However, each passing minute, Dreamcatcher gets worse, slowly but inexorably. The last act is a rushed mess and the ending a cheesy, garish fight between CGI beasties.The biggest missed occasion is how little time is devoted to the cat-and-mouse game inside Jonesy's mind between him and the alien presence stalking him, which was also the best part in the book; those few scenes are far more engaging than the tiresome military subplot.Acting is decent, if unexceptional. The least convincing is probably Freeman, which is strange considering what a superb actor he is. Maybe I have seen him play a benevolent mentor figure too many times, but he appears miscast and doesn't convey the creepy charisma his character should have.Dreamcatcher is not completely worthless. With a better last act, more scenes inside Jonesy's mind and a stronger ending, it could have been solid. But from Kasdan and Goldman - who, between the two of them, have written Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Empire Strikes Back, Marathon Man, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Misery, The Princess Bride - it was legitimate to expect a lot more.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on a Stephen king novel that packs drama , monster movie , aliens and extrasensory powers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Friends on a camping trip , they meet for a weekend at their remote cabin in the forests and discover that the town they're vacationing in, is being plagued in an unusual fashion by parasitic aliens from outer space . Four friends : Thomas Jane as Henry , Jason Lee as Beaver , Damian Lewis as Jonesy and Timothy Olyphant as Pete share extrasensory powers and hung a dreamcatcher in their cabin. It's about to catch something it cannot stop and the things are definitely going awry . Meanwhile , military officers (Morgan Freeman , Tom Sizemore) attempt to stop them and we reach the final highlight with the future of mankind at danger.This Sci-Fi movie contains , thrills , suspense , intrigue , strange events and is pretty entertaining . The film is a blend of genres as a yucky monsters movie , a military paranoia picture and drama about childhood with influence on adult life ; all of them squashed into one . Being difficult to muster these diverse elements and director fails partially in its union . It's a rendition of a Stephen King novel , King sold the movie rights for $1 . There were many references to other Stephen King projects, such as: Misery (car wreck in the snow); Stand by Me (boyhood friends walking on railroad tracks , a typical Stephen King nostalgia vignette); It (flashbacks showing growing friendships), etc. And of course the story taking place in Maine - Stephen King's state of birth. This was the story that Stephen wrote while he recovered from his near fatal accident , it is reflected in the story, especially in a graphic scene in which a major character in run down by a vehicle and he wrote the novel in longhand. This marks the third film that William Goldman has adapted from a Stephen King novel , the others were Hearts in Atlantis (2001) and Misery (1990).Rousing musical score by the successful composer James Newton Howard . Colorful though dark cinematography by John Seale . This moving Sci-fi , as long as spectacular, has become a nice film , being finely written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan who also directed other genres as Western as ¨Wyatt Earp¨ and ¨Silverado¨. Furthermore , he made other good movies as ¨Body heat¨, ¨The big chill¨ , ¨Grand Canyon¨ . Rating : 6 , acceptable and passable but overlong as the runtime is approx two hours and some . Even those who don't usually like Science Fiction or monster movies are sure to enjoy it . Worthwhile watching .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different Thriller !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had this movie with me past 3 months. I watched it today. I think this movie was underrated because of the book. In fact I hadn't even read its synopsis so I had no idea about the story. I think that made me enjoy this movie better. The movie has a heavy plot. Since the synopsis was not read the fist 15 - 20 minutes were like a puzzle to me. It had achieved my full concentration in that time so that the rest of the story can be watched in a thriller style. This move is meant for serious watching. The direction of the movie is good enough, the actors done their part well, the special effects were spectacular, and the plot (in my opinion) is also great. The frequent to and fro traveling through years and the compilation of too many genres are the drawbacks. After all a good movie......give it a try (you won't be disappointed)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a pretty versatile movie watcher, and i am willing to give any movie the benefit of the doubt... but this movie was ridiculous! It was interesting, almost riveting, for maybe a half hour. But as any hitchcock fan will tell you, everything is scarier if you don't know exactly what it is your afraid of! They "let the cat out of the bag" far too early, and the rest of the movie dragged; there was no more suspense! My advice to all of you is to avoid the film at all costs. If you know someone that has seen it, do yourself a favor, and let them talk you out of seeing it. The one redeeming factor is seeing Jason Lee in a role different from his typical Kevin Smith Film roles (not that they're not good too!)...and that's about all i have to say! Thanks for letting me vent:-)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally most movies seem to get me very bored. And that's probably therefore I need something new to get my attention. If your sick and tired of bad and way to predictable comedies, action movies etc. Dreamcatcher might be something for you. Well, it was for me. I haven't read the book so I wouldn't know if the movie differs from the book. So from my perspective it's just a great movie. It had humour, horror, thriller and action all in one. Of course I must admit that some things in the movie seems silly, but that's what you could expect from movie based on a book by Steven King!? "It" had a clown running around scaring kids!! I gave it 10 out of 10. The current average of the votes doesn't seem fair to me - maybe it's me who's weird...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stand by 'It' with misery shining through the mist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can picture the perceived triumph Laurence Kasdan may have felt when he landed the movie rights to a Stephen King property. Kasdan might have imagined a big come-back after his squandered, early success. But his movie is a raging pile of feeble, corporate-Hollywood-approved clichés. And King (who writes jejune garbage) contributes two dozen of his own lazy clichés: A group of adults who were friends as kids (It, Stand by Me) are hemmed in by a big snowstorm (Misery, The Shining) and threatened by a substance that grows along every surface (Creepshow), and a fanged/clawed tentacle (It, The Mist) shows up to bore us all over again.Here's a small helping of the teeming awfulness in the first half hour of this movie: * The movie opens with a long, verbal product placement for Carls Jr. hamburgers * A passenger encourages a driver to speed through a snow storm, and gee, what happens? Darwin calling! * One kid wears improbably huge-dork glasses, one has red hair so that when the adult actors replace them, they can skip all that exposition explaining who's who.There is no way to summarize this movie without sounding like a hyperactive 4 yr old. "...and then the friends get stuck in a cabin, and then an alien snake comes out of this guys butt, and then the guy becomes the alien, and then the guy pees in the snow and then a snake alien bites him on the wiener, and then the alien guy imagines he has an evil twin, and then the cabin window becomes a magic window, and then these kids join superpowers to find a missing girl, and then the aliens combine into a red cloud-forcefield..." Stephen King is absolutely ridiculous. Every elaboration he provides is insipid.What a complete waste of three hot guys (Olyphant, Lee, Jayne). What a disgrace it must be to be an actor and have to accept jobs like this. Even if you know Kasdan is a hack, you'll be stunned by this atrocity. Saying it's "the worst movie ever made," doesn't come close... Inconceivably terrible. Inept in every way.</fullReview>

After the glorious two - "Fright Night" and "Evil Dead" - this is the third in my Great Trinity of Horror/Sci-Fi Comedies ! The special effects are great, and so is the music, with such a crazy bunch of arguably some of the most talented people like Morgan Freeman, Damian Lewis, Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Tom Sizemore. With director/writer Kasdan &amp; Goldman, duo who made extremely funny and entertaining film of pretty mediocre King's story. Insanely amusing and well crafted !However, I was too fooled by previews and announcement's for the movie, fooled into expecting some seriously frighting Horror/Sci-Fi film with gore and lots of shockers, serious story and chilling possibilities, which led me to hate it on my first watching. Then one boring day I actually realized my mistake. What a moron I was to adopt perspective of some stupid previews, instead watching it as I always watch films - with open mind upon my own perspective. Soon that afternoon I was in video store renting Dreamcatcher for another watching. This time was pure enjoyment ;-)) !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes dreams are too elusive...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's any upside to the recent advent of DVDs adding audio-commentaries and documentaries to movies no one wanted to see in the first place, it's this; One can, perhaps, glean what went wrong with a movie that seemed to have so much going for it. In this case, with Dreamcatcher, that premise is put to the ultimate use.It's quite telling that the Dreamcatcher DVD has included an interview with Stephen King after he has seen the rough cut of the film. First of all, King has little to say about the actual movie and more on his motivation on writing the book (the car accident in '99). His only bon mot seems to be a throw away comment that "it's very good." Yet, even with this slight endorsement from "The King" one is dumbfounded that he isn't cracking the camera lense with a pipe in pure, irrational vengence for making such a prime embarrassment out of his novel.But no, here's King making a statement, which in itself by even agreeing to be seen associated with this free-wheeling catastrophe, is a sort of endoresment. So this tells me that somehow, somewhere at the sourse, there had to be something wrong in the batter. I think it's also valuable to note that King also DID NOT endorse the Kubrick version of The Shining, but rather, put his seal of approval on the later tv-movie version starring Stephen Weber. While Webers performance was admirable in this retooling, I don't think anyones making the mistake of replacing Jack Nicholson on their AFI lists.So, here was have King wanting to fashion a sort of Stand By Me meets B-movie monster flick. Along comes Kasdan...who one would assume would rather retool this premise and find a way to keep all the monsters inside the characters heads and play out the movie in a therapists office (which, aptly, the movie actually does at the top. ) From there all resemblence to a Lawrence Kadan movie ends.Which, once again, brings me back to the DVD. Kasdan tells how William Goldman took a pass at the script (not 'passed' which I'm sure alot of folks now wish they had)and alluded that he wanted to remove alot of the 'bigger aspects' of the script. One can only dream, pardon the pun, of what that film could have been. Kasdan continues to say that he put all those elements back cause he wanted to "Do something different." Well, he suceeded. The feeling is of a director who knows the exact nuance and fringes of character, behavior with a strong sense of dialogue and development who then careens off-the-road into a territory of the unknown where the boundaries of taste, believability and ridiculousness match that off only Ed Wood.There was first, some sense that perhaps this production went south when Kasdan had wrapped the shooting and then lost all restraint in the post-production CGI effort. Maybe, just maybe, he farmed out the creature effects to a company and they muscled him into believing these were good ideas. But, alas, no. If there's only one scene that shatters that notion it's where Thomas Jane has a psychic conversation with Damian Lewis and he uses the gun handle as a psychic telephone. One wonders if/ how they kept a straight face through the shooting of that sequence and whether Tom Sizemore walked off the set to put a gun to his own head.Which leads to, onceagain, to how did you have so many elemnts and go so wrong?It seems like Kasdan wasn't interested in making a an M. Night Shyamalan film...he WANTED the overblown sci-fi. It's simply a case of overcompensation, trying 'too hard' to escape those elemnts that you excel in It's akin to Morgan Freeman's performance in that you expect that usual astute, complex performance and instead he sheels you with bland, cliche military bravado with an occasional "Bucko" thrown in to remind you he's tried and true american.There were fleeting moments through-out DC that I pondered some metaphor for communism. The recurring 'red' infection, the possession of the mind, the overblown americana and internment camps at the military base. But decided mid-way that the movie, if trying for such an outdated metaphor, wasn't worth the analysis.All in all, it must be said that all these words wouldn't be put down about such a traesty if it didn't enrage people who were being led along into thinking this was gonna be a good movie. The cast of non-superstar, yet more ably talented movie regulars, in Tim Olyphant (GO, Gone in Sixty Seconds), Jason Lee (Mumford, Chasing Amy) Damian Lewis (Band of Brothers) and Thomas Jane (The Last Time I Committed Suicide, Boogie Nights)heralds in a touching, subtle and character driven opening...the Kasdan tease to lure you inot thinking this was revamp of The Big Chill. Rounded out by Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore one wonders if this ready-to-be-stars cast wasn't scribbling down oscar acceptance notes during shooting breaks. Now they're probably getting e-mail barrages begging thme to show up for the Raspberries.Still, I'm haunted by the idea theres a version of William Goldmans script sitting out there...perhaps in a toilet with it's lid down popping up frantically to get out and attack this arena thats been sprayed with bloody crap. Maybe on the next dvd release, eh? What could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great B-monster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for a comforting film that makes sense and touches the heart this weekend, rent Barry Levinson's "Avalon." I did that last night, but Friday, I was just looking for fun and got it with the definitely B-class monster movie "Dreamcatcher." They don't make them like this anymore.  This is one of the most bizarre fun times I've had at a movie so far this year, far better than Signs. "Dreamcatcher" is an alien monster movie that has no aspirations to be anything other than that. Whereas "Signs" became another leaden attempt at Shyamalan to make some statement about human faith and destiny in an alien attack, "Dreamcatcher" simply wishes to have some fun in telling a truly bizarre story. And it does that! The pace is quick enough, with side-swiping cuts reminiscent of Star Wars, that you are constantly wondering what the next surprise will be. I have to say though that in terms of actual scares, the movie loses a lot after the initial first half hour. I actually heard a woman scream out loud during the bathroom scene, which is definitely the most suspenseful sequence in the movie. After that, it all goes downhill more or less in terms of fright, but if you want a good time in this time of anxiety and craziness, this is it. You may never again get to see Donnie Wahlberg play a retard with lymphatic leukemia who calls us all to battle with the immortal words "Sooby Sooby Doo, we 'ot some work to do." By the way, besides some very well done jumps and choreography by the "stars" of Flight of the Osiris, the short before the film is actually kind of loud and obnoxious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you read the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you read the book you will enjoy this movie. I only read it a few months ago and thought it was good but not great. As far as sci-fi stories go, it had some original twists. Then it popped up on a cable channel.It was like they took as much of the good ideas as possible and put them in the film, but left another films worth of material on the cutting board. Most of the history of Duddits was left out, the later encounter with the bullies, and tons of stuff that set up the encounter with Mr. Grey. But would you really want to watch a four hour movie? No. That's what is great about this movie - if you've read the book. If you haven't, you won't get a lot of it in depth. All in all an entertaining couple of hours with fairly decent CGI.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It had plenty of it's cruddy moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would first like to say that no one should ever see this movie without reading the book first, because that totally ruins it even more than seeing movies first usually does. *SPOILER ALERT* The whole thing about Duddits being an alien? No, that's not right and it annoyed me. I think it was Pete in the book who said that he even thought sometimes that Duddits "wasn't from this world", but nowhere was it said that he really was a bloody alien; the ending got totally screwed up, I don't have any clue what the director was thinking.Like many people, I think the first half was really good. Beaver was my favorite character in the book, and even though I thought the movie was mediocre, I thought his part was great. Jason Lee was a great guy for the part, even though his personality strayed from the book somewhat. The bathroom scene was near genius and even removed some unnecessary dirty things (i.e.: in the book, Beaver gets his balls busted).The guy who played Jonesy (sorry, I forget his name) was okay. He had a good American accent, but he didn't seem to have enough emotion for the things he was going through.Pete, as in the book, was underrated; he's obviously supposed to be the least likable character, but I thought they did a good job a making him a little more likable in the scene where he's alone with the woman(forget her name too). I was a little disappointed that in the flashback Beaver finds the girl instead of Pete, which diminishes his value even more.The guy who played Henry wasn't too great. He was a lot like the guy who played Jonesy and he kinda seemed like an idiot. I didn't like how in the beginning he was about to shoot himself (not that way in the book, but they did have to show that he wanted to kill himself), and as I sat there I was thinking, "If the phone rang while I had a gun to my head, I think I'd be shocked into shooting myself", but that's just getting nit picky, sorry.Morgan Freeman. Oh, Morgan Freeman. After Duddits's 'surprise' ending, this is what made me give the movie a low rating. What the hell, man? Kurtz was supposed to be crazy, but he didn't have as huge of a role as the movie gave him. I hated his entire part. He stole the whole movie, and as far as I'm concerned, the only reason he was in it was to have some bigger names in the movie, and he probably just insisted on having a big part. A movie like this smashed into just over two hours should have spent more time on the transition from the connection of the friends to sci-fi, and explaining things better, rather than the monstrosity that Morgan Freeman made.The thoughts of Jonesy were portrayed rather well I thought. The s***-weasels were just as SK described them in the book, and I guess the reason they were scarier in the book was because books leave things up to your imagination, so I in no way blame the director for that bit.I guess then (got a bit carried away and wrote more than I meant) I'll finish by saying: read the book and watch the movie for the bathroom scene and a little more characterization of Pete. At the end, you'll probably be disappointed, but you might want to go back and watch that scene again because it is so deliciously bloody and sadistically amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another horror/psychological/science fiction/thriller mix that almost works great but falls short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher's first half is the best. It has the character interaction that is trademark of King's writing and the cast was chosen (and performed) well. The second half was "science fiction neat," offering an action-based, and clearly established back-story (barely discussed) to the conflict between the invaders and the government, but it disrupts the psychological and personal mood set up in the first half. Ultimately, the fun/neat science fiction portion fails to deliver its apex in the way that you are lead to expect as it quickly ducks back into being a more psychological and personal story about the core people.Low Points: - Poor resolution between character conflicts in the military side. Even Sizemore complained about that in some behind the scenes stuff (i'm trying not to spoil).- Science fiction moments that are more a really well done tease than a complete offering to science fiction fans.- Not really scary, but that's not a requirement for everyone.High Points: - Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore in what is a nice reversal of their usual type casting (i hate typecasting and love to see people turn on theirs and applaud casting agents and directors who choose to do so).- Great visual effects - Humor and horror combined well as often with King's material and the cast involved.- Fantastic cast.- The science fiction tease that hints at a HUGE and ongoing back story, which makes the overall film feel bigger than it really is. A three or four hour miniseries might have covered this better. i am getting the book, just in curiosity.- A great score. The music combines creepy, science fiction and fairytale in an unobtrusive manner at moments (and i didn't notice much more than the excellent theme, so i count that as a good score if it leaves me remembering liking it... sort of).- Beautiful cinematography, in my opinion. Visual effects moments mix well with the lovely snow landscape.Overall, if you enjoy horror and science fiction crossovers that aren't outright tricks (like Event Horizon), and if you're a relatively forgiving film enthusiast who does not expect everything to meet your ideals, this movie will entertain and amuse you and maybe find a space on your shelf for future reviewing. i'm struggling with the idea of buying it myself. i seem to have a knack for liking the underdogs. The ones with great elements but which fail to maintain or deliver throughout. It seems to be my trademark...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS!!!I watched the movie then I read the book.The setup and interplay between the friends in the beginning is great, better than in the book, in a great Kasdan kind of way that really works well for this story. The internal mind scenes which seem inflatable are done in a clever way each time. Donny Walburg is surprisingly enough good in this movie.The army folks are depicted fairly poorly, but nothing I cannot live with.BUT the CGI monster at the end looks insanely cheep. It is one of the worst movie monsters I have ever seen. Kasdan is a director that should never again work with special effects. The ending ruined this otherwise great movie. When Walburg shouted "I, Duddits!!" at the horrible CGI monster my brother in law &amp; I laughed out loud in the theater. Then later when I read the book and discovered that there was no call from the book for a big monster conflict in the end I was floored. If they had used the book's ending the movie could have been truly fantastic(as it would be bore suited to Kasdan's style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie will be a cult classic! I was enthralled with the four buddies and the first appearance of the alien was over the top. I had to look away the scene was ultra frightening. I have read a lot of bad reviews of this movie but I though the acting was wonderful The directing was good and CGI was great. I think a lot of people misunderstood this film because of the sub plots and genre twisting. I also thought Donnie Wahlberg is a gifted actor and much better than his brother. The cinematography was great and well crafted. It made winter into something beautiful. I would recommend this film for Stephen King fans and people who love SCI/FI Horror flicks</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Possible Spoilers*I had watched the movie only days before I read the book when "Dreamcatcher" first came out on DVD. I was slightly lost in some aspects, but after reading the book and re-watching the movie, I personally thought everything was explained as well as it could be in only a two hour movie. Of course things were rushed quite a bit, but most Stephen King movies are.Dreamcatcher starts off by showing each individual characters life when not together, such as the book did, which I thought the movie did a very good job at portraying what King had written in the book. Of course a whole new scene had to be added. In the book, right after the individual character chapters, we were taken immediately to the woods when they were hunting. But if the movie would have done the same, we would not have known about several facts, in which some are important to the plot. Instead, the movie showed all of the four friends, Jonesy, Pete, Henry, and Beav, drinking together and having some fun. That is where we learn about the memory warehouse (in the book they did not need to discuss it because narration was written). Most of it was done subtly, but the writers for the movie let you know Pete had a drinking problem, which in the book was mostly just described in Pete's mind. If you actually pay attention during the small party they were having, you would notice Jonesy, Henry and Beaver only had at the most were five empty beer bottles, but Pete's whole side of the table was full of them. Beaver's comment about him not knowing there was enough beer in Maine for a flood to tear down Pete's memory warehouse was also helpful, in case the viewer did not notice. And just before they were all getting up to toast Duddits, in the background, you can see Pete downing the rest of his beer before picking up another. He was also the only one to drink immediately after their toast. Beaver's toothpick obsession was descibed fairly well in the book, which they should have taken more time to do in the movie. A simple question like "Why don't you take the toothpick out of your mouth for a minute, what is wrong with you?" from any character along with Beaver's response would have only taken, what, ten seconds at the most? I noted many posters are wondering about Henry trying to kill himself so early on. I really believe it is because the viewers needed to know immediately what his problem was, especially since only twenty minutes or so into the movie, Pete had asked Henry what was going on. And since Henry had only thought about it in the book, the writers had to show you how suicidal Henry was rather than just letting you wonder and dropping the subtlest of hints.That goes for many other parts of the movie. King had written such a complex story where the characters think to themselves more than speak to each other. That would explain why it was so rushed, they had to squeeze so much information in only two hours. I really liked the movie, but I strongly suggest reading the book before watching, or you may be lost and think the movie was a bunch of crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see this film has received amazing reviews on this site, but I liked it. I've never read the book, but I did read IT, and many other Stephen King books, and this story has elements of many King books, but mostly IT. It wasn't a copy though, the story is very good, and original. I think what hangs people up on this the fact that you have to use your imagination a little, something that nobody had a problem doing with IT. The acting was very good I thought, Morgan Freeman's character wasn't very well developed, but he was excellent, Damian Lewis and the guy who played Mickey Mantle in 61* (I forget his name) both did great jobs. Tom Sizemore turns in his usual performance, no matter how many different characters he plays, it's always the same character. Anyway, I'm sure most Stephen King fans will love this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly Sucked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start with what this movie did right, since that will take the least time. What Dreamcatcher does right is present us with a small handfull of interesting characters, and it provides interesting relationships between said characters. It even gives us a sometimes entertaining story and conflict in which the characters are engaged. Now that that's said, we'll move on to the bad points.For anyone not already familiar with the book, the story does nothing to prepare us for the fact that aliens are responsible for the events that are occurring. This makes the reveal a jarring, incongruous experience, which is so badly contrived as to be comical. Just because King leads us to believe that this is a formulaic supernatural 'King' story, and then runs completely counter to that doesn't mean the story is any good; it just means it has a gimmick. That gimmick is not enough to carry the weight of the characters or the potential the story has, and as a result, fails utterly.The next thing (not sequentially in the movie) this film does wrong is provide the audience with possibly the longest running fart joke in the history of cinema. Audiences that delighted in The Green Mile will find this tiresome very quickly, although fans of Scary Movie will probably love it.Next, the movie provides us with a gratuitous gross-out scene in the bathroom, where the fart joke becomes terminal. I found myself quickly bored and inured to the sight of the gore, which is one of the things that King always does wrong; going for the gross-out. The buzz about this scene being compared to the Shower Scene in Psycho is apt on one level: the shower scene made me afraid to take showers, and the bathroom scene made me afraid to watch any more Stephen King movies.Overall, the movie is not nearly so interested with a well-crafted storyline as it is interested in rapidly hitting major plot points and moving on before anyone has time to react. This leaves us with the impression that we have followed the story, but it's only on a surface level. Why did the wild animals react the way they did? Why did they just sort of wander off, while the dog reacted with hostility? Why did the dog just whimper when the humans turned into gas factories? What happens to the people that don't succumb to Ripley? For that matter, what happens to the ones that do? And of course, why is it that with the capability of interstellar flight, mind control and telepathy, the aliens seem bent on taking over the planet? This last question is a source of embarrassment for many alien movies, most recently Signs.All of these questions may be answered in the book, and that's exactly who I would recommend this movie to: fans of the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Friends since childhood, their childhood prepared them to face their biggest challenge yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher is one of my favorite Stephen King Novels, in the top five with IT, The Stand, The Talisman, and The Black House. Historically I have always been disappointed in the movies that have come from the King novels and then they discovered the mini-series format. Along came The and IT other than the ending in IT, I was very excited, I thought they had found the secret to KING. His novels paint such a complete picture of his world that you need more time than the normal two hour window.I saw the preview of Dreamcatcher and thought that this might just work. All my favorites seemed to be there: Beaver, Jonesy, Henry, Pete. There was Duddits. So far so good, I was hooked I had to see this movie. I wanted to see if they have managed to do what no one had really captured so far. Could they condense KING into two hours. They seemed to have gotten the first part going... they had grasped the feel, if not the meat of the plot of the first part of the book.... and then... then... they began to slip.spoilers start here guys...Morgan Freeman... I love the man... in nearly everything he does.... but ... whether it was the fault of the writers or ... the way he decided to go with the part... he just didn't get Abe Kurtz. The man was nuts and evil. Sizemore had his part nailed, and the others did their parts, but the whole concentration camp atmosphere was played down and Kurtz was weakened and lost his punch and where was the inner circle. The book brought to mind a Hitler like feeling about him and it was lost. In my mind I pictured Anthony Hopkins, or perhaps Christopher Walken who plays the psychotic so well. Even John Voight as he was in Annoconda.I won't go into detail about the ending, but those who read the book will know that the ending in the book was much better. Let's just say that Henry and Jonesy did their part to manipulate Mr. Gray... and the cheesy ending in the movie made even the wife who hadn't read the book go "What?" The movie gets the score of 7 of 10 due to the overall look and feel of the movie and for the parts of the movie that worked. The special effects and the work of the actors. Freeman did a good job with what he had. IT just didn't work for me. The others brought their characters to life for me. I love KING and even a marginal KING movie is better than none. Dreamcatcher for me would have been better as a two or four part mini-series, and I would have watched every night, then bought the DVD.Listen up guys, KING works best when you don't strip away what makes his novels work so well, the hard work that gives you the the richness of the characters and the reality to the story. That's what puts you in the moment and suspends belief, what makes you care about the characters, and what makes you forget where you are for the time you are reading. When I finish a KING novel, I look at the back cover disappointed that the book is over, already missing the friends I have made. THAT is what makes a good book.. and when you leave the movie sorry that it ended... you know it was a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Highly underrated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher was an ingenious film, combining many great movie elements with good acting and very good characters, which seem to be very average blue collar types. However, take note that this is coming from somebody who has NOT read the original novel or seen the prequel to this "Stand By Me". Even without seeing the prequel to this however, I felt quickly connected to the characters. They might not have been developed too much, but there was definitely something likable about each of the film's four protagonists. Morgan Freeman also acts out his role as a complete effing psychopath pretty well if you ask me. As for the story, the beginning of the film seems to draw your interest in the story by presenting a few details about the characters' lives along with a few odd psychological things which motivated me to keep watching. Anyways a bit before halfway through the movie, it completely changes direction and is pretty weird. However, this weirdness which others have complained about. There are indeed times where you don't know whether to laugh or be freaked out, but it really is a combination of both. Anyways, overall it is a movie which kept me intrigued as to what was really going on and how the characters would end up. Basically if you're not afraid of movies containing weird or psychological plots, then you should appreciate this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Godzilla vs.Aliens including military attack and clairvoyance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why are all Stephen-King-Films just about the same? They start interesting, include more and more horror-stereotypes, are in many aspects just science-extremely-fictional (such extreme that they simply get unbelievable) and do not leave any message or have any deeper sense. And after all the content has nothing to do with the title. "Dreamcatcher" is a very good proof of that. It starts with a few people who can "see" the thoughts of other people. We learn that they have this feature from a mentally disabled child who turns out to be a good alien who stops an invasion of bad aliens because the army only has a special staff fighting against them and their leader has gone insane. Yaaawn. I would not have been surprised if Godzilla or King-Kong had a guest-appearance, too. Then there are so many time-jumps in the storyline that sometimes it is hard to know what is now and what is past. There even are numerous logical failures in the story. The mentally handicapped child gets roughed up by a gang of bigger children in the beginning. At the end he defeats the mr.big-alien. Erm. OK. Then the bad alien tries to put a single worm into the water-supply-system and it is said that this would be enough to destroy mankind. Oh well, if it was that simple, why do the aliens start a big invasion with a big spaceship causing a lot of trouble and resistance while just one of them idiots could have done this in a secret mission? Then, I like science-fiction - but Stephen King seems to love simply unrealistic things, such unrealistic that the film becomes absurd. And after all...what hast the film, the story or anything in it to do with dreams or dreamcatchers? I don't know. And perhaps nobody does, not even the author. I gave the film 3 points out of 10 because stage direction and actors are quite good.</fullReview>

But I was exited for it and interested in it, because title, cast and previews made me looking forward to a suspenseful story and mysterious thrilling.The first part made me hope for more, it began better than expected. I felt like watching a movie, that deals with a psychic but unusual, non obvious plot. It was getting more and more exciting and it was really developing, not just happening.Then, sorry for the spoilers, I can't keep them unwritten, then, suddenly, in a confusing, but exciting moment: an alien monster crawls out of the toilet, which is hungry for...watch it yourself if you want.With more than 2 hours this movie is too long, but that doesn't matter no more. Don't think I dislike alien movies in general, but this is just a very usual one.To be fair I have to mention, that the director or writer or whoever also wants to tell us a message that's behind of all this science-fiction-alien-stuff. With a lot of good will you can recognize this message, it's about the value of your memories, how to keep them up, how to ignore them, how to delete them, how to bring them back, how to live with them and how to handle them. Unfortunately this message is not reliable no more, not after all these things happening before.It's regrettable how the movie makers underachieve the capability of the opening story...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-adapted Stephen King story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance, Lawrence Kasdan might seem an odd choice to be directing a slasher/science fiction movie based on a Stephen King novel. But the story revolves around a group of friends who grew up together and who are having an adventure in the woods, albeit with an extraterrestrial, so it works out quite well. William Goldman also wrote the screenplay, so this film has a good pedigree.The four friends grew up together in a small Maine town, and what binds them to one another is their encounter with saving a retarded boy, Duddits, from being tormented by the school jocks. Duddits isn't what he appears to be, however, and through their friendship, the four acquire extra-sensory powers - being able to read other people's minds, being able to find lost things, etc.The four guys are out on their annual getaway in the Maine woods when a lost hunter staggers into their cabin one day. He's sick, though, and in due course it's revealed that he's been infected by some alien organism, which resembles a large wormlike creature that has grown inside him. It escapes and kills one of them, and then the extraterrestrial appears and takes over the body of the remaining guy (the other two were off on a beer run).The film is about stopping the alien from taking over the Earth. Its plan is to deposit these worm creatures in the reservoir that provides Boston's drinking water, so that they can infect the population and multiply. The alien hits a snag, though, because he's using the body of a man who can communicate through ESP, and his remaining friends realize what's going on and set out to stop him.One of the flaws in the movie comes about with the introduction of Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore at this point. They play the leaders of some special ops force whose job it is to track and eliminate extraterrestrials. It was necessary for the story to advance to have the presence of this military unit, however, it didn't make sense to have the two best known actors in the film chewing up unnecessary scenery. Lesser knowns would have worked better and these characters roles subdued.I won't spoil the ending here, but overall I thought this was a pretty entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bizarre but fun and one of the better King adaptations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I had high hopes for this movie, but I was wondering how they would try to condense more than 800 pages into little more than two hours. While I was reading the novel I already knew that lots of things from the book had to go for the movie. I missed most of the battle of wills that was happening in Jonesy´s "mind-warehouse" (What was there was way too short but wonderfully realized). The murderous ride to the water reservoir and the camp sequences were much more interesting in the book. And what about making an alien out of Duddits. Man, that was an extremely dumb idea.But despite all it´s flaws, I had a great time at the cinema. I found this one funny, suspenseful and nearly as bizarre as the novel. The acting ranged from ok to great (Jason Lee as Beaver), John Seale´s camerawork was great, the editing and music were good and the FX were fine (except for the aliens which looked extremely cheesy to me). I think this movie was too bizarre for most of the critics and most of the audience, just because there´s too much from everything in it and it defies any categorization.Surely it´s a failure but a honorable one. It might have been better suited as a TV miniseries, but who knows.I hate Christine, Tommyknockers and both versions of Shining, I don´t like Firestarter, Silver bullet, Pet sematary, Tommyknockers and many other King adaptations, but I think Dreamcatcher is one of the better movie versions like Stand by me, Misery, Carrie, Cujo (which also had a dumb ending patched on), Dead Zone, Dolores Claiborne and TV´s Storm of the century.The best way to watch it is by expecting nothing, but that may be impossible after reading all those bad reviews and comments....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a nightmare that got through my Dreamcatcher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the Novel by Steven King - These words have been used to promote many films; most are utter crap, some are actually quite good. Dreamcatcher does not fall into the latter catagory however, and it ranks up there with Graveyard Shift, The Mangler, and Cujo as the worst films based on King's writings (which by this point is saying a lot).The plot involves a group of you men who become mind-readers due to their childhood friendship with a retarded kid who carries around a Scooby Doo lunch box. As with all mentally challenged people in Hollywood movies this young man has a special gift, and he just happens to be psychic, and teaches his friends to use this power as well. The psychic powers these guys develop enable them to find car keys for hot chicks and psychoanalyze fatboys, but they are amazingly unable to use these powers to predict what is going to happen to them. So when alien beings begin to stalk them in the backwoods of Maine, their powers range from conveniently useful to non-existant depending on whether or not a particular character is going to die.The aliens in question are trying to infect mankind with a virus that will spread their kind across the globe...and these aliens don't burst out of a character's chest, oh no, they exit through a person's ass. Whenever a character's stomach moves around strangely and they start farting constantly it is because they are about to crap out an alien. Keep this in mind next time someone sounds like they are dying in the stall next to yours in the restroom, because they may infact be ridding themself of an alien creature and not just a couple burritos from Taco Bell...To say that a movie alien looks fake is something of a contradiction since I assume most of us have never seen a real alien, but the aliens in this film will more than likely provoke laughter from you, just as it did from me and several other members of the audience I was in. The alien in Mission to Mars is my benchmark for horrendously represented alien creatures, and while Dreamcatcher does not equal M2M,it is no slouch itself. You'll see many snake-like creatures with razor sharp teeth, a few tiny ones that look like leeches, and one horrible giant man-like alien that provided some unintentional comic relief. Then there is something at the end which is hardly shown much at all, but it basically looked like a larger version of the snake creatures, which is to say it looked like more CG animation gone terribly wrong.There is too much talent involved with this film for it have been as bad as it was. Every aspect of this film is deficient...the plot was terrible and excrutiatingly predictable, the acting was about as stilted as your average circus clown, the dialogue atrocious, and the scares manufactured by music jolts. And poor Morgan Freeman, what in the world is this skilled thespian doing in this film, and why do his eyebrows look like they themselves are growing and trying to take over the world? Also, the finale has something to do with the aliens trying to get into the water supply, and this will supposedly doom all of mankind. Morgan "Shoulda refinanced that mortgage payment" Freeman states earlier in the film that he has been fighting aliens for 25 years...aliens are intelligent enough to come all this way through the universe yet they are now finally coming up with the plan for infecting our water supply after 25 years of futility? Please.Several people left the theater about 10 minutes before the end of the film...this is not a football game and they were worried about beating 50,000 people out the door to miss the traffic, because the movie let out at 12:45 am. This is the only film where I have seen 2 separate groups of people leave that close to the end of a film. I always stay through the end of a film, no matter how terrible, but I couldn't help but envy the value they put on their time.A few moments of "so bad it's good" entertainment, but otherwise a complete waste of time and money, and I do not throw this insult out there lightly. It is quite simply an awful, awful film.Lucky Boy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read the book, when I heard that this movie was made, I thought that the movie was going to be great. I loved the book and couldn't wait to see how it would be brought out on the screen. A friend of mine, however, had already seen it, and he warned me not to watch this movie because it was really bad. Being stubborn, though, I watched it anyway.It didn't take long to realize that I should have listened to him.So much of the story takes place in the characters' heads, either by their thought process or, in Jonesy's case, literally, that it just doesn't translate well onto video. Other things were changed, some I realize needed to be done in a movie adaptation, but others most certainly did not. The worst and most glaring change was making Duddits an alien. I don't know what those people were thinking when they did that, but the change was, not only unnecessary, but also the absolute stupidest part of the movie (yes, I said "stupidest", it's that bad).Would the movie be any better, if I hadn't read the book before? I don't know, but I can't imagine that it would be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only saw a portion of this movie on cable ( somewhere around where they meet the infected farting guy and some of the flashbacks ) and I know I didn't miss anything by changing the channel when Morgan Freeman began attacking the stupid worms with his helicopter gunships. The whole thing looked patched-up and rushed. I have not read this book as I am not a fan of Stephen King - "IT" was the only book of his that I finished; generally enjoyable, but with the silliest ending to a book ever printed. SK seems to concentrate on "psychic" ghost stories. And when he tries to introduce science-fiction elements into his horror writing - like this "Dreamcatcher" thing - it seems to fall way short of the Lovecraftian "Cosmic Horror" that he seems to aim for.</fullReview>

It's weird as a movie- it's as if the director has taken several genres and cut and pasted them for fun- the et-style buddy movie with the 'gifted' kid, the sideways-esquire group of bitter middle aged guys, the crazy aliens-with-guns going to blow us up and the horror flick with things jumping out at people on the toilet. Oh, yeah, and the whole psychological explore your mind bit too. Maybe if he'd just done one genre and done it badly it may have made the movie unmemorable, but now it's so rank it rates a listing on the all time worst movies list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Adaptation at its Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DREAMCATCHER is the most recent in a long line of terrible Stephen King novel adaptations. Usually, this would mean that Stephen King himself had a hand in the film. However, he had nothing to do with this bomb, so I did expect a lot more, considering that it was directed by Lawrence Kasdan (THE BIG CHILL and SILVERADO) and written by William Goldman, who gave us BUTCH CASSIDY, ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN, and THE PRINCESS BRIDE. The script consists almost entirely of inane, expository dialogue leading us from one painfully absurd situation to the next. The situations and set-ups are so absurd, in fact, that the parts that are supposed to be terrifying and thrilling are simply asinine. That alone would be bad enough, but there are several other ridiculous events going on simultaneously at any given time in the film. I guess Kasdan thought if he continuously jumped around among several sequences, no one would be able to stop and realize how bad the movie is. WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD! I haven't read the book, but what gets me is that the story in the movie has nothing to do with a dreamcatcher, the Indian device that hangs over a sleeper and "catchers" bad dreams. It has nothing to do with the supernatural, but rather, is about an alien invasion that follows no line of logic. If these aliens have been around for 20+ years, according to the colonel, played by Morgan Freeman, and it only takes one little vermiform creature to contaminate a city's water supply to start the destruction of mankind, then how inept must these aliens be to have failed in this simple task in that amount of time? And what did the main characters have to do with all of this, aside from befriending Duddits? What is Duddits and was his only purpose in life to kill Mr. Grey, a giant alien worm at the very moment he's about to destroy the world? Maybe the book expands on all of this, but the movie certainly does not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the previews, you might be led to believe that Dreamcatcher is a fast-paced, edge of your seat, Stephen King-style thriller.It's amazing how previews can lead you to believe that yet another tired movie about aliens attempting to destroy humanity for no productive reason other than they're aliens and they need to eliminate humanity because it's their innate nature could actually be a fast-paced, edge of your seat, Stephen-King style thriller. It's also amazing to consider how many soulless executives stamped their seals of approval on it to support the release of a sub-mediocre movie like Dreamcatcher to the general public.The film begins by presenting four friends (Dr. Henry Devlin, Joe 'Beaver' Clarendon, Gary 'Jonesy' Jones, and Pete Moore, portrayed by Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Damian Lewis, and Timothy Olyphant, respectively) who seem to have strange psychic powers. They all go on a hunting trip, aliens invade, and crazy highjinks ensue! There are enough fart jokes in this movie to entertain any second grade classroom! Fortunately, the four friends have been given crazy abilities by some slow kid named Duddits, played by Donnie Wahlberg.Donnie Wahlberg? Oh-oh-oh-o-o. The right stuff.Morgan Freeman reprises his role as 'the older black mentor to younger white person who shows potential but who can make it to the top with a little bit of guidance' from, well, just about every movie he's ever done. Don't get me wrong, I like Morgan Freeman, and I think he's the best actor in the world to play 'the older black mentor to younger white person who shows potential but who can make it to the top with a little bit of guidance' but he has nothing to work with in this script. One of his lines, seriously, is "25 years, I've been fighting these alien bastards..." I'm not making that up. He and Tom Sizemore play government agents (with some of the poorest dialogue ever) that combat evil alien invasions.I read somewhere that Stephen King sold the movie rights to this film for $1. I think he made out pretty well on the deal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After making a couple years search to find what could possibly be the worst film ever made, I think I've finally succeeded. It's really too bad, because Dreamcatcher starts out interesting enough, and drags down and down in a spiral of awfulness.Five friends all have different gifts. Each year they get together and stay up at a mountain house for the weekend. The first thirty minutes of this movie are very intriguing and really spark your interest. All until you see the first alien, which looks like a human penis. The scene where one character is fighting with it made me laugh more then anything.But if you're renting this film for a laugh, you'll be disappointed. After that initial scene, I didn't want to waste the energy on laughing anymore. The film gets worse and worse until you get to the point where you don't even care anymore. The only good acting job in this film is done by Thomas Jane. Even Morgan Freeman sucks in this movie. It's just overall awful.I've never read the novel that this film is based on, and after watching the film, I have no desire to as well. It's just a craptacular work of film making.Steer very clear of this pile.</fullReview>

Childhood friends gather in adulthood to battle a monster (hmmm . . . "It"?). Each friend has a special supernatural talent (hmmm . . . "Firestarter"? "Carrie"? Every King novel ever written?). A terrible snowstorm traps the men in a small town, and makes escape impossible (hmmm . . . "The Shining"? "The Storm of the Century"? "Misery"?).I was very embarrassed for Morgan Freeman, a fabulous actor with classic movies on his resume, appear in this pile of nonsense. You'll also see (if you choose to watch) Jason Lee of "Chasing Amy" and Thomas Jane, who did a wonderful job as Mickey Mantle in the cable film "51*". I wonder if any of them will ever get work again after this one.Stephen King seems to write as if he wants us to run screaming.

		<shortDescription>Promising first act, then falls flat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I never read the book. So any comments here are based entirely on the film itself.It has credentials. Based on a Stephen King novel (which is hit-and-miss, some being good, some being crap), adapted by William Goldman and Lawrence Kasdan (two of the better adaptors/screenwriters out there, a definite plus), and directed by Kasdan, 'Dreamcatcher' had the potential to be a well-crafted adaptation. Toss in a quality quartet of actors as the lead group of friends (Timothy Olyphant, Thomas Jane, Damian Lewis, and Jason Lee), and Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore as military officials, and you should be golden, right?Well, not exactly.'Dreamcatcher' has an impressive start, as the four friends go on their annual retreat to a mountain cabin in the dead of winter. Seems that they all share a hybrid ESP gift, given to them by an old friend, and the camaraderie shown by these guys is well-played by their actors. While they're up at the cabin, a stranger shows up with a bizarre infection and later 'births' a vicious alien creature.At this point, we're okay. The movie's established good relations with its lead actors, it built some tension with the infection, and delivered an effective scare with the first appearance of the alien. After that, though, the entire plot heads off down the 'alien invasion' track, becoming little more than a glorified B-monster-movie. The quality camaraderie of the four friends is mostly wasted, and Freeman and Sizemore exist mainly to direct the story towards its inevitable climax. After the beast shows up, 'Dreamcatcher' just falls in on itself and collapses.Lots of problems here. First, the story seems little more than a mish-mash of old King plot devices. The four friends sharing the secret past ('Stand By Me') band together to face down the alien enemy years later as adults ('It'). The alien itself has the ability to take over minds, and the ESP powers the kids-turned-men have seem reminiscent of 'Tommyknockers'. Throw in the quickly-spreading infection ('The Stand') and the car accident near the remote cabin ('Misery'), and there's very little that's new here.Secondly, the film doesn't pay off on the promising opening it delivers. Lee, Olyphant, Jane and Lewis seem like natural buddies, lifelong friends (which they are, as far as the story goes), but they have really only the one scene where they get to play off each other. A few flashbacks are given to their childhood, but that only makes you realize more how little emphasis was given on their friendship as adults before the film turned into a creature feature.I agree that the idea of Jonesy's (Lewis) mind as a warehouse of memory is a well-executed one that works visually as well as within the context of the story. But too little else in 'Dreamcatcher' is as original or given as much thought. By the time the whole saga plays out, you've pretty much lost your taste for it, and the shocks that were given in the first act have long since worn off. Average at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twenty year flash forward &amp; backward problematical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this book by Stephen King and would have been pleased if it had never been made into a movie - - now that I have seen the Goldman (screenwriter) &amp; Kasdan (director - co-writer) adaptation on DVD this Labor Day Weekend 2007 I'm quite sure that a major studio mega-budget can't fix what your imagination can. My advice is read the book and then pick a title that's not related to a prior media project (e.g. PAN'S_LABYRINTH of last year). The set-up for DREAMCATCHER (novel and movie) is classic Stephen King as far as defeating evil that has possessed and contaminated the community. The song that is vintage early Baby Boomer ("Blue Bayou" / Roy Orbison) that somehow is a "stuck in the mind" common denominator DOESN'T quite work as far as its origin and various covers fitting the 20 years prior to 2003 or whatever the year of the film's time setting. What goes extremely haywire in this action film replete with gross-out sh*t-weasels (King's way of scaring the readers way out of our comfort zones) is the not-very convincing military scenes that reminded me way, way too much of MEN_IN_BLACK as far as super-villain aliens who can be wiped out with only a barely detectable sense of "shoot first, ask questions later" and no unintended consequences to follow. The book is much more frightening as far as the way that Jonesy is held prisoner in his Warehouse of Memories and he figures out ways to entice Mr. Gray to overplay "his hand" and plan for world domination. The DVD extra of having Stephen King make a kind of cameo amongst the Special Feature choices was great for fans like me but I still have trouble rating this horror-action film more than a 7 in IMDb's rating system. I would rate it a R-16 and not just a PG-13 if I was running the MPAA system. Kids might inadvertently learn not to drive fast through snowy roads (even if you are seat-belted) as some of the characters learn, crashing with surprisingly minor injuries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lawrence Kasan doing an adaptation of a Stephen King novel; you'd think that the man who was in part responsible for Raiders of the Lost Ark and Empire Strikes Back, and directed a good film or two in his time, would be able to make a memorable work by the author. It is memorable, in it's way, but not really as the author might've intended. Or maybe it is; maybe it's such a gross-out factor in Dreamcatcher that had King trudge through this. But maybe another problem with adaptating a book like this, another of his I've yet to read, is that it's immense in size and scope (from what I remember from seeing the size of in in hardcover, a dictionary almost). But whatever the reason, Dreamcatcher is a mess, and not just in what pops up on screen from the one-hour mark onward. It starts off promisingly, with a couple of flashback scenes to a childhood setting where the main male characters have a particular struggle, and a 'special' person is helped by them, and also helps them in return. This has that element of King writing kids that always works well, a tinge of Stand By Me there with an added brush of humanism. Then the story shifts to the friends reuniting in a cabin up in a snowbound mountain. Things seem honky-dory, but they soon turn ugly, very ugly, and then, well, here comes the real juicy parts.What starts off as a story with some interesting fantasy elements involving a 'dreamcatcher', something that binds together these characters thoughts somehow, goes off into a crazy alien invasion story. The aliens are dealt with in a very nasty manner, and not in a kind of fun-nasty manner that has been done in other science fiction films or stories. I could deal with the way the aliens first sort of, erm, surface, which involves a part of the body I'd rather not mention here. But then it infects one or two of the others, and it turns one definitely into a kind of bizarre schitzo homicidal maniac who also happens to ride around on the snow on a jet-ski. Then the government gets involved, with Morgan Freeman popping up in one of the very rare times I had displeasure watching him in a movie. He can be the greatest of actors in this day and age, but the character- an obsessive general on the hunt at any cost for the aliens- is beneath him, and any sense he tries to bring to the part gets swept away by the muckedy muck of the story around him.Would I recommend Dreamcatcher even as a so-bad-it's-good horror movie? Probably not even as that. There were a few moments I could remember, when I finally gave myself away from any sense of reality and turned over to the delirium of the second half of the movie, and it was funny to a degree that was almost cheating but still goofy. But those moments are few and far between. The film overall is a muddle, a lurid take on a story where the characters are set-up OK, and then knocked down or turned on their hinges as what was neat to start with soon evaporates. And one wonders if it's more to blame on Kasdan/screenwriter William Goldman's end, who tried to take on the large-scale scope of King's work, or the actual source material itself. Apparently it was the book that King wrote after suffering from being hit by a car years ago, perhaps as his sort of therapy back to his old writing chops. Which is fine- but for it to be this, and from a man far more talented than such manic, searching-for-scares-other-than-gore tactics like in Dreamcatcher.In short, not a pleasant experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This flick wasn't nearly as bad as some film versions of King's work. In fact the CG work was very good. I really liked the high angle shot of the snow falling down towards the tracking of the guys riding through the forest. The guy getting creamed by the car was a wonderful render. Too many people it seems can't deal with camp and horror at the same time. I thought this film pulled that off pretty well. I didn't get up and leave like I've during past film excursions into King stories. It's difficult to pull a king story off well when transposing to film because King deals too deep with your brain. You form these visions of his stories that most directors can't duplicate. Look at The Dead Zone. Great story but the movie blew chunks for me. Why? Because I had this pre-concieved notion of the characters mindset and the film didn't match it well. Probably the folks here who are bitching that this film was so bad have already read the book ( I did not) and thus, can't accept the version as a faithful re-telling of the story. But, technically, this movie wasn't nearly as awful as some 'alien' pictures I've suffered through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How tough it must be to be a best selling but uncelebrated writer. King earned his reputation on a simple strength: the ability to create a straight, singlethreaded story that engaged. The goal was to literally create a sustained series of cliffhangers so that readers would be addicted to what comes next. He worked with the bizarre in doing so.But other writers were making money too, accomplishing this in easier ways, notably using the shuffle effect. Here, you have many, many characters and stories that interweave in ways to be discovered. Each story needs its local motivations, and each its resolution. By shuffling back and forth, you force your reader to make an investment which keeps them engaged. The stories themselves and manner of writing can be less clever.Here is King trying that on for size. Here is King discovering that it is hard for him to make each story trivial. He cannot help himself; he grows each of the bits as large as he can, with the blind intention of making each bizarrely charming. Its an odd irony: here is a device crafted for bad writers that in the hands of a good writer produces bad writing.Watch as he builds too much of the competing government conspiracies and personal agendas therein. Watch as he overloads the metaphors of threat: captured dreams, captured thoughts and memories, captured bodies, poisoned cities, the capture of government by conspirators within, the loss of individuals minds through SIDDS, the destruction of all humans. Watch as he conflates the ironies in physical spaces: the cabin and the 'memory warehouse.' Watch as he stumbles and gives lessons to contemporary writers everywhere.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another failed King adaptation brought to the screen, completely missing everything that made the book good. While the novel was a sort of best-of-King medley, the film focuses too much on the sci fi and action elements of the story. This means that most of the characterization and plot coherency is gone.The film starts out decent enough and stays pretty true to the book for about half of the running time, but then the movie shifts gear and turns plain silly. The book isn't exactly easy to adapt for the screen (things like Jonesy hiding in his own head), but some of the choices the screenwriters did are just moronic (the ending is painfully bad).The acting feels kind of stilted (probably due to lack of background story), and most of the characters are just anonymous faces. This leaves you with a film that sure looks good and feels expensive, but that can't hide the fact that their trying to hide the cheesy script behind a layer of visual effects. King definitely works best on the page. [3/10]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VERY confusing film if you've never read the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all honesty I didn't really like Dreamcatcher, the book or the film. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Stephen King fan since I was twelve years old and I first read Pet Sematary, but Dreamcatcher seemed to be a repeat of It and Stand By Me thrown together with a lot of crass humor, confusing subplots and coming-of-age boyhood nostalgia all at odd places.Events throughout the film happen in rapid sequence and if you haven't read the book, this is very confusing. Characters and their various situations and POV's are thrown at you left and right, and the film flips from the past to the present with no explanation. The main four guys as adults soon meet up in a cabin, doodling, writing "SSDD" on the table and playing poker, and as they idly chat their conversations are very unrealistic. They swear, stoop to sex jokes and crude humor like a gang of 7th graders and they talk about women as if they're objects. I've seen apes at the zoo that seem more intelligent than these guys.As the film goes on, Douglas, or "Duttis", is introduced. He is a mentally disabled boy who was rescued from bullies back in the 60's (70's, 80's?) by the four boys, as seen in a flashback.Two of the guys in the cabin are later on interrupted by a man named Mcarthy who is invited inside after being lost in the snow all night. He starts burping and farting and of course the guys think this is a laugh riot. Next thing they know Mcarthy is dead on the toilet, giving birth to an alien leech thing with sharp teeth which the guys dub "the sh!tweasels".The film really doesn't improve much from there.Dreamcatcher had decent acting, a good soundtrack and beautiful rural scenery, but it was just a burden to watch through. I'm not a prude or anything but the crude humor got on my nerves and the whole film quickly began to drag on. It got more and more confusing as it went and it made me wonder if Stephen King was a little "off" when he seriously thought to himself, "Gee, I think I'll write an overly long novel about aliens in a small town that make people burp to death and I'll throw in all the same material from my older novel It to make it seem like a trip down memory lane!"</fullReview>

He claims to have seen mentally handicapped Duddits (Donnie Wahlberg) calling him from across the street whom the friends rescued 20 years ago. They go on their annual hunting trip in the woods six months later. Jonesy rescues Rick McCarthy who seems to be lost in the woods. Rick seems to be sick with uncontrollable gas. The animals are all running away from something. Henry and Pete gets into a car accident. Then Curtis (Morgan Freeman) on a military helicopter flies overhead to announce a quarantine. There is an infestation of alien slugs that go for the groin. Curtis has been battling them for 25 years.There is just way too much story to stuff into one movie. I can't comment on the Stephen King novel. It may be unfilmable in its entirety. I can't figure out how 25 years of this kind of action with so many infected would go unnoticed. Also I don't know why Beaver is so anxious to pick up a toothpick. A lot of this movie leaves me scratching my head. The only thing that I like (uncomfortably) are the alien slugs. If the movie kept it simple, there may be a great creature feature. Lawrence Kasdan is not known for horror and I think he took on too much in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goes off the rails pretty quickly and becomes increasingly insane - a great bad movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher is a one of a kind mess, a film so disjointed and bizarre that for all of its problems, you can never fault it for being predictable. A handful of childhood friends who have some psychic abilities, meet annually in a remote snowbound cabin to unwind and drink. That is interrupted by infected people passing gas and having parasitic aliens burst out of their anus. William Goldman, the man who wrote All the President's Men and Lawrence Kasdan who made the Big Chill and co-wrote The Empire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost Ark - combine their talents to a first act dedicated to scatological humor, then scatological horror and basically all things gas and poo. Something tells me they weren't reaching for an Oscar nomination on this one. Soon after the lowbrow first act, the military quarantines the area and we are introduced to the villainous Morgan Freeman character who plays things so serious and speaks only in cliché military speak, that almost every line out of his mouth is unintentionally funny. The absurd first act that seems never to be taken seriously for a moment, to this evil military nonsense is a seismic tonal shift, that begins the 'what the hell?' feel that Dreamcatcher revels in. Basically what follows is incomprehensible and insane. An alien wants to contaminate the water supply, Morgan Freeman delivers lines like "I've been fighting these alien bastards for 25 years!" without the slightest hint of wit, Donnie Wahlberg shows up as a severely retarded alien man with leukemia and a Scooby-Doo lunchbox and it's all entertainingly bonkers. The effects are mostly decent, there is some nice cinematography but the script must have been written by the two seasoned pros as they rediscovered the joys of intoxication and typing a script. There's no other justification of the mess they made and trust me, when you see the bathroom set piece covered in blood and poo, it's a serious mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The critics mostly dumped on this film. I thought it was a well constructed, acted, sci-fi/horror film, that really got the short end of the proverbial stick, poked right in the eye, or any orifice available.The cinematography is quite stunning, the special effects done very well. The storyline is very good, as far as these type of movies go. Some pretty good gore scenes that help build dread &amp; suspense of being isolated in the deep woods in mid winter, with no help insight. Then when help is found, things even get worse. Though the military, government actions in this film are clichéd, but then again, that's what these films are comprised of, almost 100% of the time. It's not whether it's a new idea, but how well that idea is executed in the film. Here it works.Interesting characters &amp; plot twists, make "Dreamcatcher" worthy of a nightmare!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Big Chill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lawrence Kasdan's "Dreamcatcher" provides a good guide as to what one gets when a Stephen King novel is faithfully adapted for the screen: farting aliens, flying saucers, military helicopters, CGI monsters and one dimensional bad guys. All this is grafted onto other fairly common King tropes: a nostalgia for childhood, a love for various trinkets of Americana (lunch boxes, hunting lodges, pick-up trucks etc), and a plot in which "something mysterious happens to a group of children in the past" which will "affect them as adults in the future".The film is terrible, but nevertheless has some interesting things scattered about. Kasdan's cinematography is excellent, his snow swept vistas are impressive and the film's first act is fairly good. Most interesting, though, are a pair of shots which reveal extra terrestrials. The first is a slow pan which discloses a giant, big-headed alien standing in the living room of a log cabin. This image comes so far out of left-field that it generates a pretty creepy ontological shock. The film is worth viewing for this single sequence, and the look of terror on the face of the actor standing before the creature.The second sequence of interest ? truly bizarre ? is one in which military helicopters open fire on a field of CGI aliens, who abruptly scatter by diving into the Earth. These two scenes are so odd, so at odds with everything that previously went on in the film, that they generate weird shocks to the system. Everything else in the film, including future sightings of CGI aliens and creatures, is wholly inept.4/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex, Interesting, Well-Acted Drama Of Screwed-Up Alien Invasion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jonesy, Henry, Pete and Beaver are four friends from Maine who make an annual trip to a remote cabin in the hills to hang out and hunt deer. On this occasion however things go badly, as a snow storm hits, Henry and Pete are in a car crash, military helicopters buzz overhead, and Jonesy and Beaver are attacked by a monster ?This is an enjoyable, suspenseful, well-acted, solid adaptation of Stephen King's novel about alien invasion. It's particularly well written by Kasdan and William Goldman since like much of King's fiction a lot of the narrative and the ideas are internalised thoughts in the characters' heads, like Jonesy's memory warehouse or his self-dialogue with Mr Grey. Kasdan finds clever and amusing ways to visualise these which somehow keep the story flowing without making the actors look silly and the piece flows towards an exciting and satisfying finale. I have to say though, it's not one of my favourite King stories (and I've read 'em all), partly because it's a little derivative of previous books (the idiot savant from The Stand, the kids reunited from It, the alien mind-meld from The Tommyknockers) and other people's movies (the weasel life cycle is a hair-curling gross variation on Alien), but mostly because it's fairly grim and dogmatic throughout - Jonesy and Henry are our two heroes but since one has been taken over by an extra-terrestrial and the other is a suicidal depressive it's hard to get close to them. The movie plugs away though, with all the good ideas from the book, and fine performances from all. Lewis is terrific as Jones; haunted, comical, scared as he tries to come to grips with what's happening to him. When he talks to himself a la Gollum, he should be ridiculous but he isn't - he gives Mr Grey an English accent and just goes for it, and manages to ring a terrific change on that old fifties sci-fi stalwart, the mindless alien takeover victim. Olyphant too is first-rate as the happy drunk Pete who meets with a sticky end, and Freeman literally brings in the heavy guns as the army head-honcho (whose psychosis is toned down considerably from the book), though I spent most of his performance looking at his crazy eyebrows. Kasdan's work is strongly character based and this is no exception, despite the crazy goings-on, and he weaves his cast together but also turns in a beautiful looking film; gifted Australian cinematographer John Seale (The Hitcher, The Perfect Storm) fills the screen with wintry atmosphere right from the start and shoots everything - intimate dinner scenes, big effects sequences and action alike - with suspense and flair. And yet again James Newton Howard provides a fantastic horror movie score which contributes immensely to the tone - I think he's now become the official successor to the late Jerry Goldsmith as the Horror Music Maestro. All in all, a consistently scary, interesting and skilfully crafted flick, but perhaps not the best choice of King's work to adapt. Shot near Prince George in British Columbia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generally decent but unmemorable, like the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher was neither the best nor the worst of King's novels. The movie is the same, neither the best or the worst. It is a watchable, forgettable horror flick.Having read the book within the last year, I still have a pretty good memory of it. For the most part the movie attempts to be faithful to the book. The order of things is rearranged to avoid too many flashbacks (easier to get away with in a book than a movie) but the basic ideas are all there. The story has many details cut out but contains all the main points.Some things are left out and some things aren't quite as I would have expected. Morgan Freeman seems to rationale for the role he is cast in (and the choice to give him crazy bushy eyebrows is just strange).The biggest changes involve making the story more specific. There was a certain random quality to the book in which various things happened and later those things happened to line up. In the movie, there is a reason for everything. This isn't bad, and it's an understandable approach, but it's not interesting and leads to a very different (and cheaper) end than the book.It's about what I expected, a standard King adaptation. Since I have a cold, I just wanted something mindless and easy to watch, so I can't complain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film - give it a chance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Heres to Duddits - Our Dreamcatcher" I only saw this film initially as I am a big fan of Damian Lewis. I had read multiple bad reviews about it, but I wanted to try it. I did and boy, I enjoyed it! So the cast: DAMIAN LEWIS as Gary 'Jonesy' Jones, the slightly reserved history professor (well more reserved than his friends at least!).JASON LEE as Joe 'Beaver' Claredon, the divorcée with an obsession with toothpicks! THOMAS JANE as Henry Devlin, the shrink who is seriously considering suicide.TIMOTHY OLYPHANT as Pete Moore, the car salesman with a knack for finding things and who definitely likes his beer.DONNIE WAHLBERG as Douglas 'Duddits' Cavell, the mentally disabled man who, 20 years earlier, was saved from bullies by the four friends.MORGAN FREEMAN as Abe Curtis, the obsessed alien hunter who has been on the job for 25 years and may not be as sane as he believes.TOM SIZEMORE as Owen Underhill, a colleague of Curtis who wants to get rid of the alien parasites, but questions his friend's motives.So the story begins with the four friends - Jonesy, Beaver, Pete and Henry - living their separate lives, meeting once a year for a hunting trip to drink, reminisce on their childhood and toast to Duddits, the boy who they saved from bullies 20 years earlier. Duddits then gave each of them the ability to read minds - being especially sensitive to each others thoughts in particular. Ever since, the four have visited 'Hole in the Wall', a cabin in the snowy woods of Maine, however this year something is different. When the animals begin to flee the woods, the area is placed under quarantine and a stranger arrives with a strange illness, what should be an enjoyable trip turns into a horrific fight for survival amidst an alien invasion.While this film may not be Avatar, it is still a great watch, therefore I recommend it. Do not simply read the negative reviews and think 'It's not worth watching' - give it a try. I have my opinion, they have theirs, now let yourself form your own. Even if you don't like it, still give it a go. You never know!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like it very much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read most of the comments here, and generally this movie is entertaining but not many would recommend it because it differs from the book. I haven't read the book and may read it one day. I watched this movie without any idea about the plot, and that was when it was released and over the years I have re-watched it several times, in fact every time it was aired on TV in various channels. Truth is I really enjoyed this movie. I am not a big sci-fi fan so the story about Mr Grey and the alien worms didn't interest me much although they were scary and yes, sometimes borderline silly. What I enjoyed was the acting and the characters. You can basically divide this story into 3 sections; one would be the alien invasion story, 2nd the 5 friends story and the last being the obsessed military men and what they were willing to do to cover up. Franky I didn't quite understand the alien story and I didn't give any thoughts to the military men story which was silly at best. Morgan Freeman was good, as always but his character was way way way over the top for me to even begin to look at it as a character in a serious movie.And this is a serious movie, despite a death involving a toilet, some angry looking worms and a poor dog. What I love was and still is the story about the 4 friends who were willing to die defending the other. And their friendship and respect for one other friend who is mentally handicapped but is gifted in a special way. I love how they cared for one another and the gentle way they communicate with each other, a big departure from most of the buddy buddy movies I have seen. One small scene that I remembered well was how Henry told Jonesy to stop taking the logs into the cabin since Jonesy was hurt, and Henry could do it for him. How they all see Duddits not as someone with a handicap but as someone special, someone they respect and look up to. How one friend cried to his friend to run as the alien worm was ready to strike.The best is of course the performances. Everybody did well, and perhaps the one that surprised me most was Donnie Wahlberg, proving his acting chops as the mentally handicapped Duddits and he is by far the better actor between the 2 wahlbergs. The others were great as well with Damian Lewis leading the pack in the scale of impressive scale of acting since he had to play a fearful victim and the evil hunter, so to speak in 2 distinct accents, both of which he excels.Maybe it is just me but I find the end credit scenes with the friends sitting at a table and laughing and chatting a bit depressing, since out of the 5 3 died in the end. So the ending didn't make sense or may be a departure from the book, but take way the comparisons and just look at the movie as it is, the special effects are pretty good, the story pretty engaging, the performances the highlight and the director was right to end it with the friends around the table chatting happily. I think the focus was right, it is in the end to me a movie that illustrates the friendship which to me is the most powerful theme in this movie. All the sci-fi, aliens, crazy military men and special effects were just everything else.Which is why I like this movie and wouldn't mind repeated viewings. It's a story with heart and that is what counts, even if it features aliens exploding from the bottoms of their victims.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>as a visual representation of the book it is well done, as movie as itself?.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all the audience that have read the novel before watching the movie it is acceptable and even touching at several moments to see those scenes in a well done visual representation (I mean only those particularly moments) For a person who has not previously read the King's novel may find it as monsters B-movie and there's no way he could appreciate it fully because I believe it is required to have read the book before in order to know some details that are important in order to fully understand the story. I understand that it may result very difficult to adaptate some issues of this novel (for example all the telepathic properties of the Gray boys and the end where in the novel Duddits gets into Jonnesy's head to kill Mr. Gray, episode that not only it is hard to representate but in the movie the director change it and did it awfully ) into a movie though at the same time it would be a shame to waste such story and not roll a movie on it. What I am trying to say it's that the book it's great and because of that, I will always prefer to have a movie to watch the scenes and characters that were great in the novel, in a screenplay. It's always nice to watch a movie of a book you enjoyed to see and compare what your mind generated when you read the book with the work done by the team that roll the movie. The main problem it's to have an acceptable adaptation from the novel to the movie, what it is often hard to do. As I said, in this case seemed to be a very hard thing to do, and I don't think the director passed the test. I agree with some of the reviews I read here where the said what you have seen in the first quarter of the movie it's the part that it's best adapted; the rest of the movie has several problems regarding the adaptation process.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's not to like?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was describing this movie to friends and when I couldn't recall the name, looked it up here on IMDb. I was truly surprised at how many people found it unwatchable because I have seen this movie about 3 or 4 times and reading about it here, would really like to see it again.I am guessing that most people who went to see it like horror and/or sci-fi and this movie would definitely not be for anybody who doesn't like these genres. But I think what sets Dreamcatcher apart is that it falls into the M. Night Shyamalan sort of horror that is not supposed to be scary so much as intriguing; although Dreamcatcher is way more extreme in it's imagery which I thought was very funny and very unique.I have never read the book, but I think the movie does a really great job of weaving an obviously very complex paranormal drama into the sci-fi/horror backdrop. It's funny how a lot of people who reviewed this movie here describe it as a group of guys who just happen to be in the woods when something really weird happens, but this description completely overlooks the reason these guys are there which is the thing that links them and ultimately the reason that they happen to be in the woods when the great weirdness occurs there.Finally, I really enjoyed how the story was constructed, weaving in the past present and future in a way that was probably not really obvious to the average viewer. The characters were very fun and strange and as in M. Night Shyamalan movies, the gore was silly and fun, and also like his movies there was a meaningful story behind it all that reveals how the seemingly meek or helpless can play a profound role in setting the wrongs in the world right.</fullReview>

Upon the arrival of the army things just go downhill from there. The acting was fairly solid, well at least for the first half. I'm so disappointed because this film started out so well.

		<fullReview>Many people seem to expect a film to be completely faithful to a book, some even expect a film to be exactly the same scene by scene as the book. These people are bound to be disappointed by most, if not nearly all the films they see. A film is a film, not an animated version of a book and should be judged on its own merit.There are plenty of things in this film that will annoy those who liked the book, for example the revelation of who Duddits really is or the truncation of the chase scenes, but these don't really bother me. The film works as film, in fact I rather like the ending which annoyed many fans of the book. The visualisation of alien worm is brilliantly executed, as well as the preceding scenes with the infected man which are funny and horrendous by turns.There are a few flaws though - Morgan Freeman as the somewhat deranged alien hunter is disappointing and unconvincing (and what's with the eyebrows?), the middle of the film sags a bit after a good start, also a few unconvincing scenarios (would you prefer to have your life or a toothpick?), and the plot has echos to many of Stephen King's other books. But some of these are not the fault of the film, rather it's Stephen King's.Overall it is an enjoyable film, far from great, but enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was not bad, but unfortunately not one of the very best. There was too many things in it, that all of us have already seen in other movies. The story of a invasion form outer space (popular since H.G. Wells "The War of the Worlds"), the hiding of the alien offspring in human bodies (yes, we all have seen it in "Alien"), the little worms remember me to some parts used in "The X-Files" and so on, and so on. Some parts of the movie was borrowed from older stories from Stephen King too: Remember "It" or "Stand by me" in both the story was build up on a childhood-friendship of the actors too. So we see nothing really new in it, no new idea. It was build up on parts "borrowed" from other movies. The FX was well made and the story was good made too in its development, but a lot of the potential of the story was thrown away: I remember a very similar movie, in which a giant fungus grow under a town and kill all the people after he had learned to read her thoughts and later think for himself he was God. Unfortunately i don't remember the movie-title, but this story was really far better and contains a lot of new ideas. "Dreamcatcher" was not bad at all, but i can give it only 6 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

And of course movies were the world gets saved 20 times requiring 10 bullets per minute and lots of 'sudden' plot chances, yet you are just watching the movie instead of living it. Resulting in you turning it of after 40 minutes of wasted time- 2. The cover suggest a totally different movie (ghost's 'n stuff), which makes the first few predictions you make completely wrong -I always predict what is going to happen next, if that it doesn't happen I like it. I suspect most people do that (except my mom)- And the movie keeps doing unexpected thing. 3. The special effects and acting are great 4. I love the imagery in this movie, the brain, for example, is done great. Also I would like to note that my experience is that if you have read the book, the movie has the tendency to suck. And if I read the comments here a lot of people seem to have read the book, so this should take the average down. Yet I can not understand that 10% of all votes is a 1!</fullReview>

One of the biggest problems of the screenplay was probably how to realize the many parts of the story which are only in the minds of people - and I think a very well solution was found. Especially the memory warehouse is good and also the solution of how to see the line.

		<fullReview>I did not expect to be let down like this. The thrilling Stephen King novel shows up on the screen a bit haphazard. When the story line strays from the novel, so does the interest in the movie. The special effects are very good and overall photography excellent with awesome scenery. Four telepathic buddies make their annual trip to their favorite hunting cabin in the dense woods of Maine. A troubled stranger is brought into the cabin and then a hellish string of events begin. We are introduced to a strange virus named Rigley; gruesome s***weasels that incubate in a host stomach and are then released by way of the anus; stranded aliens known as "Blue Boys" and a power hungry Colonel wanting to destroy all aliens and cover up this whole incident. If you have not read the book you are wondering what and why in the hell the second half of the movie becomes so unexplainable. If you like gore and suspense you will like this movie in spite of itself. Most Stephen King novels relate well on the screen, but this is not a good example. It is real fun to watch, just don't get involved in the who, what and why.The able cast includes: Thomas Jane, Damian Lewis, Jason Lee, Tom Sizemore, Donnie Wahlberg and a miscast Morgan Freeman as Colonel Kurtz.

		<fullReview>Give me a frickin' break! In a sense, Dreamcatcher is very much like having to endure listening to Stephen King's Greatest Hits played by an earnest, but utterly talentless tribute band.Suspiciously void of almost all women, Dreamcather is one very-very clumsy adaptation of King's clichéd novel of the same name. At times Dreamcatcher almost seems like watching 3, or 4, or 5 (?) different movies all squashed and crammed into one.First we start off with the "Bosom-Buddies-with-ESP" movie - Then it's the "Alien-Coming-Out-Of-Your-Ass" movie - Then it's the "Military-Paranoia" movie - And, then, finally (?), it's your typical "King-Childhood-Nostalgia" vignette.As you can well-imagine - By the time that we reach this film's somewhat predictable climax, with the future of all mankind at stake (yawn!), it's certainly difficult to muster any real interest in any of it at all.I mean, who frickin' gives a damn? And, like, what the hell does this movie's title "Dreamcatcher" have to do with anything, anyways? Sheesh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreamcatcher Drops Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good novelists, regardless of how outlandish the subject matter, should have the ability to formulate settings, characters, plots and sub-plots in such a way as to compose coherent mental images for the reader. Stephen King generally succeeds in doing this with 'Dreamcatcher' an overlong (600 plus pages)amalgamation of science-fiction, fantasy and horror. The plot begins with four school friends and their involvement with a telepathic Down sufferer who seems to be capable of passing on his psychic abilities to them. In later years the four, now men on their annual hunting trip, find themselves deeply involved in an alien invasion. At this stage the plot strands involve both a physical chase and a cerebral dance as one of the aliens attempts to occupy both mind and body of one of the men. So far so good... The challenge for the film maker adapting a novel is to try to be as faithful to the original as possible within the constraints of budget. The cinemagoer, if having already read the novel should be willing to forgive minor plot and character changes. So far so good... Director Lawrence Kasdan and screenwriter William Goldman, given an estimated $68million to play with, carefully transposed the first third of the novel to the silver screen... and then decided to virtually abandon the whole enterprise in favour of a typical gung ho Hollywood chase film! Whilst there are still a few rather interesting scenes involving the telepathic battle between Jonesy and his alien nemesis, particularly those involving the library of the mind, these seem to be mere side issues rather than significant moments. The chase itself deviates wildly from the novel by the simple expedient of employing a character who should have been killed off earlier! The final indignity is reserved for the very end when any pretence to following Mr King's denouement is passed over in favour of giving full rein to the special effects department. Anybody who read the novel first will wonder what happened after the first third of what turns out to be a very turgid 136 minutes. Anybody who did not read the novel will be left at least slightly confused. Considering the amount of money, this whole project could have been so much better - it would surely have been better suited to a mini-series format. Messrs Kasdan and Goldman should apologise both to Stephen King and his fans</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will never again watch anything by this writer, am extremely resentful that I have just wasted 2.5 hours (including damn commercials) watching this rubbish on TV. The film suddenly ends with no resolution, no idea of the future, no indication of any answer, nothing, it just ends and the credits roll. I rate this 2/10. There were maybe ten minutes of amusing footage, but that is all. The rest was garbled, unintelligible mass and poor direction. Morgan Freeman was ridiculous, merely reading his lines. And don't tell me that there are deep intellectual meanings underneath. With a high IQ and a doctorate degree, I don't need that sort of dross.

		<fullReview>I didn't realize this was based on a Stephen King novel when I started watching it. I suppose that if I had, I wouldn't have been so disappointed with the direction it eventually went. I got very interested in the first half hour or so of the movie. The abilities of the friends, the flash backs where they rescue a handicapped kid from much older bullies. I expected the film to go in a completely different direction. Instead it turns into a rather boring alien/monster movie that really has nothing new to offer the genre. Since they start seeing visions (or at least one of them does) of the young boy they rescued before they even go back for their annual hunting trip, I don't understand the point of them. Because they had yet to come into the area of influence of the alien. I also never did figure out the connection to dreamcatchers and why it was titled that. Of course, I was so disappointed in the movie that I gave up on it and never finished it. If you know what you are going to get before you sit down to it, the movie may not be so bad. But if you start watching it with no expectations, then you get presented with one kind of movie that later completely changes on you, it is a major let down. I want that hour of my life back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One too many plot lines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read the Stephen King novel ... maybe it works better there? But I couldn't help feeling that there were two plot lines, enough for two separate movies, and at times they interfered with each other, both in the believability of the overall plot, and in the nature of the special effects. The plot line concerned with the childhood flashbacks, the "special" kid, the corresponding special effects, and the effect on and the relationship between the main characters was excellent -- suggestive, flashbacks well handled, never overdone. I wanted more of that side of things. Of course some crisis was required to give point to the plot -- but an "Alien XXX" clone?? The alien S/E were OK and even excellent in spots, but somehow the two plot threads, and the S/E for each of them, seemed disconnected. Take away that special childhood relationship -- and you still have a rip-snorter "Aliens have landed" plot with enough subplots to keep interest up. The fight against the aliens really takes over the movie, to the point where the original special person and his relationship with the principals comes in at the end like a "deus ex machina" (aka "how're we going to get them out of this one") finish. This is particularly noticeable in watching the alternate ending (included in the DVD), which I preferred; it is much more downbeat with less bloody splash than the ending-as-released. Visually excellent, and well worth the watching, but definitely flawed for me by this lack of focus, so only 6/10.</fullReview>

On the other hand, if your M.O. is mindlessly choking down someone else's second-hand garbage, then the movie will certainly provide many such opportunities for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Distinctly average Stephen King thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1990s, the big slogan of Stephen King's advertising was "words are his power". This was very true, for few people can string together more than two hundred thousand words and keep them as interesting to the reader as is the case with King. Unfortunately, words are also his failing to a certain degree. It is hardly a coincidence that of all the King novels that have been adapted to the big screen, the best job was done with The Dead Zone, a novel that hardly exceeds the standard one hundred thousand word length. And director David Cronenberg was still unable to get a lot of the salient details into his adaptation.It is hard to say exactly where adaptations of King's stories go wrong. Some, such as The Stand or It, try to fit too much story detail into too little time. Others, such as The Shining, focus too much on cosmetic details and therefore lose the entire thread or point of the story. Then there are the kind that cannot make up their mind, such as The Tommyknockers. It used to be that whatever else Stephen King was guilty of, being conventional or stupid was not it. Unfortunately, that changes the moment Dreamcatcher's plot is advanced by such stupidities as ceasing to hold down a toilet seat for the sake of a toothpick. I know that King once made a good story out of the horse being lost for want of a shoe, but this is just plain silly.The first forty or so minutes of the film seem promising as the central characters are introduced. The problem comes when the alien invaders are revealed, and the story descends into the usual science-fiction-horror clichés. The whole alternate universe, alternate reality convention also gets a beating here, as King obviously likes the concept of a warped universe. Unfortunately, by trying to mesh this warped universe with a realistic concept, things just don't quite seem to gel. The result feels somewhat like two stories being told at the same time.I never thought I would say that it appears Thomas Jane can act. Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore do their usual characters, while Donnie Wahlberg shows that he has been sadly underutilised during the past fifteen years. But the real stars of this feature are the special effects, which come thick and fast at moments when we're meant to be questioning the actions of the heroes. The grey men we see from time to time are almost believable enough to appear as if a special effects crew built them from clay. The worm-like creatures, on the other hand, are so real in appearance that they almost seem to sweat like living things. In fact, it is also possible to say from this film that CGI is starting to become a believable device.Unfortunately, it is the plot, and only the plot, which devolves into a low-rent Terminator-style chase in the last act, that keeps Dreamcatcher from achieving its potential. I can only hope the source material is better than this, although I have been assured a number of times that Dreamcatcher is indeed among the weakest of King's work. Then again, King is a good example of the theory of obscurity in practice. Perhaps it is not such a coincidence that Stephen King is one of the few authors who allows the Hollywood system to regularly adapt his work. Jumping genres is a fairly easy, even allowable, thing to do in epic literature. In film, it can only really be done once before the results becoming disjointed. If it weren't for the strong performances from a great cast, in fact, this whole film would be a complete mess.I gave Dreamcatcher a five out of ten. It is also the first time I have seen evidence that both Wahlberg brothers can act. Indeed, Donnie is among the best things about this film, which is either a sad indictment upon the rest of the film, or a great compliment to Donnie Wahlberg. The decision about which, sadly, has to rest with the individual viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must Be Seen To Be Believed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DREAMCATCHER is the most horrible film I've ever seen. The acting is wildly uneven, the script is chock-full of cliches and the plot is all over the place, spanning from coming-of-age tale to horror film to military thriller to sci-fi to teen fart comedy. That said, this is one of the best films I've ever seen. If I sound unsure of myself at any time, it's because this movie has sent me reeling. One thing is for sure: I've never seen anything like this, and neither has anyone else. It's the strangest, craziest, most subversive big-studio film since NAKED LUNCH. Here are some examples: Henry (Thomas Jane) contacts his friend Jonesy (Damian Lewis), who's trapped in his own mind by an alien creature, through a form of telekenisis granted to them by their mentally challenged, leukeimia-ridden friend Duddits (Donnie Wahlberg!). He is able to reach Jonesy, who calls from a phone in his mind. Henry has no phone, so the ringing comes through John Wayne's .45 handgun, which he holds like the receiver of a phone and speaks through with urgency. The pure ridiculousness of this scene is not easily conveyed into words. You have to see it to really get it. That's how this whole movie was for me. I ran the full gamit of emotions, all the while my chin dropped practically to my chest. Some of the things I was seeing were too much to comprehend, but too damn strange to look away from. The violence in the film isn't weird, but the weirdness in the film is violent. Critics are attacking this film, because it obviously isn't for all tastes. One thing is for sure, though: this film is alive in a way that so few Hollywood films are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this picture a drama? Coming of age tale? Horror story? Who knows, as director Lawrence Kasdan ("The Big Chill") jams ingredients from past Stephen King successes into a blender, hits puree, and comes up with a cold bowl of gruel. Unintentionally hilarious scenes include a character inhabited by an alien who suddenly speaks with a British accent, an off screen - sound effects only - helicopter crash, and the most under lit opening in cinematic history. It's shocking that the fairly A list cast agreed to this mess. It must have been due to the director's past successes and the current pedigree of Stephen King adaptations at the time (with movies like "Dolores Claiborne" and "Shawshank Redemption" being critical darlings).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Book: Pretty Great. Movie: Awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the actual book, "Dreamcatcher", and let me first assure you that the movie didn't have to turn out this way. It might be a hard book to translate to the screen, but if they couldn't do it properly, they should not have tried.The character of "Curtis" was wrong. Additionally (referring to the Trivia section now), the character name in the book, "Kurtz", was _meant_ to be a reference to Apocalypse Now! Apocalypse Now was a reference back to Joseph Conrad's Kurtz in "Heart of Darkness" - and since that's out of copyright, I don't see what the bloody problem would have been with keeping the name, and the association, and for that matter more of the murderous character, in the movie.The ending was abysmal and not at all accurate to the book's more ambiguous, more interesting conclusion. The accent-change for Mr Grey was stupid - can we have no uncertainty or class at all? Maybe it _shouldn't_ be obvious at once which one he is! Do all aliens manipulate the voice out of its natural accent and into another?More time inside Jonesy would have been interesting and worthwhile. Better prison-camp scenes would have benefited the movie. Less CGI: stop throwing money at the movie and throw a good script at it instead!I feel so let down by this attempt at what was originally a story captivating for its, well, alien charm. Avoid the movie and either read the book, or listen to the excellent audio version of it - the narrator can paint a much better picture in a few CDs than this multi-million-dollar large-screen failure.Lawrence, you did good with your Star Wars efforts. William, you've written some great screenplays - Maverick, Misery, A Bridge Too Far, Marathon Man, All the President's Men...Stephen, you did great with the book.Maybe if you'd sold the rights for a little more these talents would have taken some care over making a movie worth anyone's time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Critics.Sometimes critics can be spot on with their reviews while most of the times you can't help to think `what in the hell were they watching'? Personally, I do not like critics. I despise the fact that they look down at horror movies like they're an annoying itch that won't go away. Granted, Hollywood does release plenty of inept horror films throughout the year that make it nearly impossible to argue with the critics. Lawrence Kasdan's `Dreamcatcher' is one of those times.In Roger Ebert's review of the film he states, `'Dreamcatcher' begins as the intriguing story of friends who share a telepathic gift, and ends as a monster movie of stunning awfulness.' I would totally agree. In the first forty minutes of the film, `Dreamcatcher' starts off promising with four friends played by Thomas Jane (Henry), Jason Lee (`Beaver'), Damian Lewis (`Jonesy') and Timothy Olyphant (Pete) and they all share a rather `strange' bond. However, as the film kicks into a silly alien invasion flick - with a `Men In Black'-style military duo (Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore) that are on the move to kick some alien ass - the film goes passed the point of no return. Freeman, one of today's best working actors, can't even turn the God-awful dialogue into anything worth listening to. It is amazing that such talent like William Goldman (`Butch Cassidy &amp; The Sundance Kid,' `All The President's Men,' `Misery,' among others) and Lawrence Kasdan (`Raiders of the Lost Ark,' `Return of the Jedi,' `The Big Chill,' among others) actually adapted this mess, which was based off the best-selling novel by Stephen King. It truly makes you think, `How in the hell can so much talent make such a bad film'?A truly inane part of the film is Damian Lewis' character `Jonesy,' who is inhabited by Mr. Gray, an alien being with a British accent! But if that were not enough, we are `treated' with Jonesy's `memory warehouse,' which as critic David Nusair states is `enough to invite Mystery Science Theater 3000-esque mocking'. I won't even get into how `Dreamcatcher' heavily `borrows' from several other notable films like `Aliens,' `Independence Day,' `The Thing' and you can even hear Morgan Freeman mutter the line `I'm getting too old for this' like Danny Glover has stated numerous times in the `Lethal Weapon' series. I could name several other films, but why beat a dead horse?If that's not bad enough, the film apparently doesn't like to explain anything. Many things are brought up and then dropped without a single explanation. Perhaps, those explanations are on the cutting room floor. But after the film ended, I didn't care about such plot holes and inconsistencies. I was just relieved that the 136-minute film was finally over. Though I must say that this film was never boring. It was just bad. However, there may be plenty of blood and guts (as well as some farting and burping) to keep some horror aficionados happy. Those who look for more qualities than that in a horror film, you should totally avoid this film at all costs. Though, I should say that not ALL critics had bad things to say about `Dreamcatcher'. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post stated that this film is `one of the more consistently entertaining Stephen King adaptations' and would go on to state that the film's special effects were `truly mesmerizing,' and that the film features `excellent performances,' `some truly arresting images,' and a `chilling score'. As I wonder `what in the hell was Lou watching?', I also think of Film critic's James Berardinelli's summary of the film. `Dreamcatcher isn't worth the time, money, or effort.' I second that. But hey, what do critics know?*1/2 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

Four men friends, close since boyhood, struggle in varying degrees with psychic abilities they seem to possess dating back to when they saved a handicapped kid from the hands of bullies; but these powers don't seem to help much during an annual camping trip out in the snowy woods of Maine, an area which the military has just quarantined after an alien invasion has brought forth a spreading plague. King's overreaching plot was adapted by director Lawrence Kasdan and William Goldman, two guys in their 50s writing for characters in their 30s; the dialogue immediately sounds fake, with conversations about Viagra and references to "Blue Bayou", Louisville Sluggers and Telly Savalas. These guys sound like old war-horses! Kasdan seems to enjoy throwaway bits of pop-culture commentary, but the chit-chat is dire and this cast Kasdan has assembled is one of the dreariest in recent memory. Even Morgan Freeman as a no-nonsense Colonel is stodgy. The gross-out effects and psychological mind games and demons are finally irrelevant in a story with nothing but human zeroes at its center. The festering results show off little except misguided talents wasting time and money--theirs and ours. NO STARS from ****</fullReview>

During the course of watching this movie you begin to realize that the actors are not cringing in horror from the gravity of the impending alien invasion, but rather from the utter silliness of their lines. Watching Damian Lewis (who I generally regard as an excellent actor due to his outstanding work in Band of Brothers) turn to Jason Lee (who risks his life and ultimately dies over a toothpick. A TOOTHPICK!!!!) and say with a straight face; "Scooby Dooby Doo, we've got some work to do now." is genuinely hilarious.

WHAT? sorry, but in what reality do a group of preadolescent/adolescent boys hug each other and sing? since when has possibly the most awkward age group become so profoundly self assured? begin suspension of disbelief here...i must have missed the transition between "duddits" and "group of guys 15 years later hunting in the woods," because there was a 5 minute discussion about who changed the channel and "what happened to the special kid?"two of the guys (at the cabin) notice that something weird is going on in the forest. another two guys get into a car accident and wreck. one of the guys from the cabin is out hunting, when he spots a guy stumbling around in the woods. he doesn't shout down to him, or greet him in anyway, but rather tracks him through the forest until the guy makes his way to the cabin. he takes him in and gets him warmed up. the guy claims he ate some bad berries and has been lost in the woods since the day before. the guy who rescues him (jonesy) seems unusually pleased and amused by the man. one almost half expects him to do something creepy to the guy, but this never happens. instead, he makes him soup, and the man starts... farting.no, seriously. the man is getting embarrassed as he starts cracking them off. the two guys in the cabin get him to bed and go for fresh air. they presumably leave and return later to find blood everywhere. thoroughly creep-ed out, they realize the guy they rescued is in the bathroom, and it's fairly apparent that his ass is leaking blood or poo or a combination of the two. i wish to god i was making this up. i'm not. you can thank Stephen king for this crap. and William Goldman. god, that one kills me.evidently, the guy is playing host to an overwhelmingly phallic looking alien that splits in two to reveal a column of razor sharp teeth. again, thank you, mister king. he shits the alien into the bowl and kicks the bucket. beav, one of the guys in the cabin, shuts the lid to the toilet and traps the alien underneath. the other guy goes for duct tape. for some UNKNOWN reason, beav desperately needs to retrieve toothpicks that he dropped onto the blood and poop covered floor. why? dunno. but in any event, he's off the toilet seat a second too long, and the penis beast gets him, first attacking his genitals then slicing off his fingers. finally eating him. his buddy returns with duct tape and holds off the penis beast for a little while before it finally gets to him and possesses him with a strange red dust. meet Mr. gray, a British, slightly kinky, homosexual extraterrestrial. Mr. gray has possessed Jonesy, one of the boys who, at the beginning of the film, was one of the boys who comforted duddits (the retarded kid, for those of you having trouble keeping up). Mr. gray manifests himself both in alien form, and in jonesy-possessed-by-Mr.-gray-form. when Mr. gray shows himself through jonesy, he grins maniacally, and says things like, "consider letting me in, jonesy. it's the polite thing to do." in a patient, motherly kind of way.i could go on about the other stupid point of the film -- the terrible dialog, the inside jokes that miss their mark for the audience, just to name a few -- but i'd rather focus on the utterly weird penis beasts with teeth that give their hosts terrible gas and then burst through their rectums. because, wow, Stephen king, you must have been really really messed up on painkillers.. that is the excuse, right? pain killers?"Stepehen King wrote the book after his accident and admits to being high on painkillers and morphine while writing it..."Yeah. i'd say that too. as if that weren't enough, the guys can now communicate telepathically, which seems to do them no good at this point in time, but one wonders why they never used this particular gift when two of them were stranded after getting into a car accident. it just doesn't really add up. or, you know, to make sure jonesy brought back milk from the store. it's a gift they've had since they were kids and hung out with duddits. anyway, to conclude, the poo and blood starts taking over but i guess fire and duddits are the way to win the war against the penis beast aliens? so the military (led, inexcusably, by Morgan freeman), firebombs the hell out of the aliens, and duddits comes and destroys Mr. gray. both Mr. gray and duddits reveal themselves as alien monster type things and Mr. gray attacks duddits with a penis beast. the penis beast is thrust into duddits, and duddits undergoes a transformation. the upshot is that it looks like two alien guys are doing the nasty, and then explode. bravo. the end! yay! what an awful, awful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Laughable Disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that HAS to be seen to be believed. A big budget, high caliber talent absolute piece of crap. One of the worst movies I have ever seen - not to say I didn't laugh out loud and that my friends didn't enjoy just how awful and unbelievable the movie is - but aside from the money they put into the special effects, the "story" and some of the acting is total trash. Stepehen King wrote the book after his accident and admits to be high on painkillers and morphine while writing it and it shows - its almost as if he was slipping in and out of a morphine dream and stealing from himself - a little "Stand By Me" a little "It", a little "Dead Zone" - what the hell. The movie goes off on so many tangents it makes your head spin - four friends befriend a strange disabled boy - basically a human E.T. - and he gives them psychic powers - only they don't have the powers for huge, long stretches of the film, which go unexplained - in fact, there are many scenes where characters sit still in one place and give long, boring speeches where they are desperately trying to explain the "plot". The movie does have EVERYthing - nostalgic flashbacks a la Stand By Me with smart alecky kids bonding over turmoil, icky horrid monsters and lots of blood coming out of animal's and human's anus, military powers trying to control a sickness, psychic abilities, car crashes, snow storms, horrible male bonding banter like out of Lowenbrau beer commercials, aliens, spaceships, evil powers overtaking people's minds - it's as if they threw ALL of King's stories into a blender and then this goopy mess was poured into THIS movie. The actor who plays Jonesy (that's another thing - the four buddies all call each clever lame nicknames like Jonesy, H and Beav - yes, that's right, BEAV!!!!) gives one of the worst performances ever captured on film once the alien force takes over his brain and he starts talking like two people - the good one and the evil one (the evil one has a British accent!!!!) - anyway, yes, you could open some beers and watch with friends and howl with delight at how awful it really is - but seriously, the movie itself - even with Kasdan behind the camera and the great Wm. Goldman writing the screenplay, is an utter and total train-wreck. Just awful!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8/10 - is he mad? No, but this movie is, and in the most entertaining ways imaginable.Dreamcatcher almost gives Lifeforce a run for its money in the greatest unintentional comedy ever made stakes. I had to rewind whole chunks of the movie to check my eyes weren't deceiving me: oh, if only I hadn't had the flu the one week it played over here - to have seen this one with an audience! After a solid opening its descent into insanity is so rapid and so unashamed that you could never mistake it for a good film but still end up loving it more than many an undisputed classic because it's just so much fun. At times you even find yourself wondering if Lawrence Kasdan made it as a drunken dare. If so, all I can say is get that man another dozen drinks, and fast! This fantastic (in every sense) movie has everything - Ripleys and shitweasels, Damian Lewis doing a comedy English accent whenever he's possessed by the alien 'Mr Grey', Morgan Freeman with crazy giant white eyebrows that even David Hemmings would have envied waxing lyrical about John Wayne's gun, Tom Sizemore seeing those aliens long before the effects boys put them in the picture, a shitweasel trying to bite Timothy Olyphant's dick off (well, maybe he could borrow Tom Sizemore's artificial penis), the toilet scene from hell and more farting in a single motion picture since Blazing Saddles. The only thing that was missing was the gratuitous nudity from Mathilda May, but hey, maybe they're holding that back for the sequel. I am truly happy to live in a world where multinational corporations spend tens of millions of dollars on such films. Definitely the most joyful and entertaining film I've seen this year</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disjointed Dreamcatcher needed Cliff Notes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*First off, any movie with alien worms out the wazoo I must like in some way. Unlike other horror flicks that deem it unnecessary to show you a monster, "Dreamcatcher" delivers incubating space worms and other E.T. unfriendlies. I appreciated the monsters. They delivered the slime and blood I've come to love and cherish.I'm sorry to say though that the movie feels like it was edited with a lawnmower. Normally, I would take my anal space worm attacks and go home happy. But "Dreamcatcher" is so disjointed that you get the distinct impression that the book must have explained a lot of what you're seeing. I wished I had a set of Cliff Notes with me while I was watching it. The movie makes you start asking yourself a bunch of questions. For instance...*SPOILER ON ENDING AND LOTS OF OTHER SPOILERS*OK, so Duddits is an alien. So why does he warn these four kids about an upcoming invasion? Was there something special about these kids? Was the alien just waiting for someone to be nice to him? Why does an alien choose as his disguise a retarded kid? Surely he could have picked something a little more fun while he's waiting for the worm invasion. And if he knows aliens are coming, why doesn't he do something about it instead of wasting away on Earth and hoping his four buddies figure it out? One alien takes over one of the humans. Why was the bad alien called "Mr. Grey"? Did the human host have a thing for English bad guys? And finally, why call the movie "Dreamcatcher"? I saw no Dream Catching. Nor did I understand why being a Dreamcatcher was important to anybody. Why not call it "Attack of the Slime Worms"?As I was leaving the theater, I realized it would have helped a lot if I had read the book. I'm sure all my questions would have been answered. The movie "Dreamcatcher" just couldn't put it all together. But on the plus side, there were ravenous space worms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly dreadful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly the worst film I have ever seen. A promising start, in which the four main protagonists are shown to have meta-physical powers of perception, sets the movie up to be a light but enjoyable Sixth Sense-style supernatural thriller. The locations are also very well selected, with the snowy log cabin in keeping with the kind of isolated Americana familiar from Misery.Unfortunately that is where the positives end. The rest of the film is an absolutely dreadful cocktail of over-acting, hackneyed plot-lines, a terrible script and woeful action scenes. It is hard to decide which is worse, the nauseating flashback scenes to our four heroes as children, the awful lines like "I want to kick some ass" and "let's lock and load" that populate the action scenes, or the bizarre fight between two monsters that arrives with absolutely no explanation at the film's "finale".The whole experience is like death by a thousand cliches, the pain not alleviated by some token gestures to post-modernity. The killer alien infection that supplies the film's basic narrative is known as Ripley "after that broad in the Alien movies" - incidentally, Morgan Freeman should never, ever be asked to say the word "broad" again.) The unkindest cut of all is the presence of such a strong cast, and particularly Morgan Freeman, in what was so self-evidently a doomed cinematic endeavour. I'm not a great Stephen King fan but Freeman's name on the billboard is enough to make me watch a movie. Never again - his personal brand is tainted. Perhaps he is a victim of Lawrence Kasdan's butchery in the cutting room, but I doubt it. If this script had landed on his doormat with a plateful of roast potatoes and carrots it couldn't have smelt any more like a turkey.I have heard it said that it is difficult to fit the complexities of King's dense prose into a two hour feature film, and that may well be true. But there is a solution - don't bother. Leave it on the page where the story is better served. Avoid like the plague.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King ruined the movie... By writing the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher had a lot of missed potential, and unfortunately that all has to do with the fact that Stephen King's signature lackluster dialog made it into the script, which gave the actors hardly anything to work with. It's most notable... Well, throughout the film. Every bit of dialog is read as if they're teenagers in a high school play. The cinematography isn't anything we haven't seen before, and the "weasels" simply look like deformed lampreys. They're not huge criticisms, and these two things didn't really bother me, but the overall lack of original iconography leaves something (icons) to be desired. The Shining had brilliant cinematography, and wonderful acting, both of which spawned countless iconic images in popular culture today. IT had Pennywise, at least. What does Dreamcatcher have? Name one thing, I dare you. In my opinion, Donnie Wahlberg gives the best performance the entire film has to offer. He plays the --marginally offensive-- character exactly the way he needed to be played; he reads the lines exactly the way they needed to be read, his physicality has the exact rules they needed to have. Every mark is hit. What little screen time Donnie has is all the movie is worth, which amounts to about 4 or 5 minutes. Everybody who is not named "Donnie Wahlberg" must have had a hard time getting into character, because the lines are read with such little conviction they could have plea-bargained down to time served plus 500 hours community service. The group's in-jokes, "F--karee", "F--karow", and "F--k me Freddy" --which are never explained-- are things that no human being who is not named "Stephen King" would ever say aloud for fear of being beaten half to death by everyone around them --that is unless they're paid to. While the sayings might work on paper, they don't translate very well to actual, real human vocalization, and leave the viewer wondering if they've had a stroke. I just don't even want to mention the flashbacks to the group's childhood. I'm sure those kids were doing their best, and I hope they had a lot of fun filming their parts. I wish King would stop inflicting his flashback sequences on the child-acting community. Typically, they aren't good sequences when adapted to the screen. Just stop it, Steve. Stop. Whatever those young actors are doing now, I certainly hope it's better than Dreamcatcher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read the source material by Stephen King I really enjoyed Dreamcatcher, with well developed characters who I cared for, and a story that was coherent, made sense and (baring in mind it's primarily Sci-Fi) was fairly believable. The film however lacked all of this.I'll start with what I liked about the film. The casting was generally good, all of the characters largely looked how I had imagined them on the page and they appear to give their best efforts at a poorly written screenplay. It is also shot quite nicely, however if you have to resort to commenting on how good the film looks, there is clearly something lacking from what is most important about a film, which is to my mind story and character. Unfortunately that is about all that I can say that's good about Dreamcatcher and the bad points far outweigh the good.The story writing and dialogue is sloppy, which may not be the director or the screenwriters fault as the book is quite content heavy. The characters are introduced very quickly and as a viewer you learn nothing of real consequence about them, which leads to me as a viewer lacking an emotional connection to them. With the exception of Jonesy the friends are meant to be introduced as being unhappy with their lives, particularly Beaver, who is only happy once reunited with his friends for their annual hunting trip, which (among other things) gives his death more emotional weight. Pete is meant to have a serious drink problem that he desperately tries to hide from his friends without success. Henry is very depressed, and like Pete tries to hide this, but also like Pete without success. None of this is covered in any detail in the film, it is briefly pointed out and then forgotten.The motivation of Owen and Curtis are really poorly done. Owen agrees to help Henry despite having not shown a great deal of resistance to the atrocities he is being ordered to commit beforehand, and having spoken to Henry for just a minute agrees to help him escape. In the book, Curtis is consistently proving himself to be mad and interested only in self preservation, his character is given a lot more time to earn his furious chase after Owen, rather than Freeman's portrayal of Curtis, who appears to have no motivation.The need to make Mr.Grey speak in a posh English accent and be constantly happy and polite was stupid as well. Mr.Grey is meant to be a character whose emotional capabilities are limited to either, extremely calm and in control or overwhelmingly frustrated and angry, slowly gaining the full range of human emotion the longer he spends inhabiting Jonsey's body. The flash backs also fail to give enough back story to make us appreciate the strength of the five kids friendship. The writing for the kids in particular is really bad, which I guess at least matches the poor acting ability of said kid actors.Overall while Dreamcatcher is not in anyway offensive, and is a perfectly tolerable, it is boring and incoherent. It lacks any kind of depth in the writing department, which granted, may have been due to the mass of content available to the creators, and makes me wonder is perhaps Dreamcatcher wouldn't be more suited to being a TV miniseries. However with the cast and source material available Dreamcatcher should have been a great deal better than it was, a very underwhelming adaptation.</fullReview>

Predictable? Not in the least bit. I thought the actors portraying the four friends were great and the characters very likable. Unfortunately, some of them (won't say who or when) don't make it. That was a bit of a shocker and a disappointment. But, I guess that's the story. This movie is a little gory, suspenseful, and unpredictable. I do think the first half is better than the second half, but still worth a watch. I gave this movie a "7" as I have seen it about 4 times since it was released,about 12 years ago, as I still find it an interesting story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A random act of kindness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher is the story of one nasty alien invasion that's spawning up in the north Maine woods where four friends Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Damian Lewis, and Timothy Olyphant have an annual guys get together for a hunting trip. In fact these aliens have tried a few times before and there's an elite military unit headed by Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore that's charged with keeping these large space worms off the planet.Experience has taught Freeman not to do anything by halves. He hears a report they've landed somewhere and he eradicates everything for miles around. That includes humans and the four hunters are in his radius.But as it turns out way back when they were kids they saved a mentally retarded young man from bullies. That random act of kindness proves to be their salvation as the four are given the power of mental telepathy. And the retarded young man played by Donnie Wahlberg as a grown man also proves to be their's and the world's salvation. I guess among other things Stephen King was trying to say you never know when a random act of kindness might pay great dividends. I'm agreeing with another reviewer who says that Dreamcatcher succeeds as drama, horror and even comedy. Check out the scene where two of the guys are trying to contain a worm inside a toilet bowl.Fans of Stephen King should like this film as well as others like me.</fullReview>

Seriously, what's with Morgan Freeman's eyebrows...the list goes on and on. We were able to figure The Wicker Man out but this one defeated us. We just can't come up with theories to answer these....We all absolutely loved Dreamcatcher. Its got all the qualities fans of bad movies look for. It keeps moving and never loses your interest in what is on screen even when you can't make heads or tails of what you are seeing. The story and key events are so confusing and dubious that you can talk with other viewers about theories and try to answer questions for hours afterwards. There's entire forums dedicated to trying to hypothesize what the hell happens in this train wreck. It's highly recommended you spend the time to view this masterpiece of horrendous film-making.Read more at: http://www.stinkermadness.com/episodes/movie- reviews/entry/films/dreamcatcher</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stephen King's Dreamcatcher. This one one is a personal favourite of mine, as I know it doesn't have the best of reputations among many circles. I like it though, it's got a nasty bite, delightfully wonky, unpredictable plot beats, a killer cast and that unmatchable surreal weirdness that only King can deliver. It's got a Stand By Me vibe as well, almost as if those kids grew up and wandered into a gruesome sci fi horror nightmare. Four friends, played by Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Damien Lewis and Timothy Olyphant, are vacationing at a remote snowbound cabin, when they notice all the wildlife from the area fleeing from some unseen threat. Something is invading the region. Soon they fall prey to a nasty parasitic thing that's hunting them in the snow, and are forced to go look for its source,, and foe help. There's some disarmingly humorous death scenes amongst the chilly, grim proceedings, and some appropriately schlocky creature effects. It turns out they aren't the only ones dealing with this unwanted intruder, when they stumble on a whack job military General (Morgan Freeman), and his sympathetic first in command (Tom Sizemore), commissioned to cleanse the area of the threat. Freeman has a bitch of a plan involving the death of innocent civilians though, and gets right out of control. Usually his and Sizemore's roles would be reversed, with Morgan as the force of reason and Tom the maniac, buts a nice shift to see them both playing against type. There's some pseudo mind control stuff as well and a cerebral subplot involving the guys strange boyhood friend Dudditz (Donnie Whalberg). It's an occasionally uneven hodge podge of horror elements, but I like it for its slick, memorable moments of gore, alien intrigue and classic Stephen King spookiness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Essentially a B-Movie with an A-Budget. At Times the Extra Money Makes for an Entertaining, Overblown Explosion of Excitement, and At Other Times it Just Seems Pretentious, Ponderous, and Pandering to Juvenile Fixations, Like Bodily Excretions.It's Got a Perky, Willing Cast Spouting the King's Speech with Self Referential and Pop-Cultural Glee. Stephen King has Said that He was Satisfied and Even Enjoyed this Adaptation of His Book. Most of His Fans and Movie Critics Did Not Agree. At Best They were Disappointed (what's new?) and at Worst They Were Downright Hostile.The Movie is an Audacious Amalgamation of the Many Things that King Takes On in His Stories. It is Actually a Rather Faithful Rendition of King's Style as Well as Subject Matter. King's Verbiage is Dense and Demanding and So is the Film as it Travels Literally All Over the Place as its Story of Extraterrestrial Invasion Unfolds. It Also Travels in Time Quite Frequently.It's One of Those Movies that is Filled with Excess, Never Pulls Back, and is Constantly Getting Bigger and Bigger as it Goes Along, and As It Does it Asks that You Carry a Lot of Baggage for Reference and it Can Be a Bit Heavy (the memory warehouse thing).The Film is Entertaining Despite its Excesses and has Enough Eye Candy, Gore, Humor, and Story to Fill a Few Films, but if You Can Take the Extra Weight of the Thing and Don't Take it At All Seriously, it Can be a Passable, and Better than Average Movie and a Better than Average Stephen King Adaptation.Overall, it's One of Those Love it or Hate it Movies. It's Worth a Watch to Find Out Where You Find Yourself. Most Likely No Matter, Because You are Unlikely to Find Yourself Bored.</fullReview>

It had very dream/nightmare quality, an odd combination of themes that only a dream could invent. It was truly creepy in a way that not many movies can capture anymore. There are a few themes that have stayed with me over the years like the library metaphor, the mind as a overstuffed and neglected old library, complete with huge old-fashioned card catalog, where every experience and idea is stored. Damian Lewis was fascinating to watch in this. One of the many things I found charming about this strange film. I have watched it again and again and enjoy it every time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King and Kasdan dream up some krazy sh*t.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher is one of those Stephen King adaptations that most people appear to hate, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't quite the nightmare I had been led to believe.As with the TV adaptation of Stephen King's IT (with which this shares many similarities), there's an awful lot going on in a relatively short space of time; this cramming of an 800-page book into a two-hour film raises issues with the flow of the narrative, the crunching of several time-spanning plot threads resulting in a rather choppy feel to proceedings and a clumsiness to certain scenes (certainly, King's more outlandish notions, such as the 'thought warehouse' and the 'sh*t weasels', could have been handled better, these parts coming across as more humorous than horrific).However, despite the film's flaws, Dreamcatcher still manages to be very entertaining, with a superb cast, excellent CGI special effects, and director Lawrence Kasdan providing some memorable sequences and conjuring up plenty of impressive imagery, using his snowy locale to great effect. Whilst definitely not a King classic, fans of the author and his films should still find plenty here to enjoy, the positives more than outweighing the negatives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Friends on a camping trip discover that the town they are vacationing in is being plagued in an unusual fashion by parasitic aliens from outer space.This film features Jason Lee being Jason Lee, including great reference to Meg Ryan with cat feces. Good acting? No. Good casting? Probably. In a stronger role was Donnie Wahlberg, who tried to push the boundaries of his talent. Was it successful? Perhaps.The film also has the running theme of Stephen King's obsession with kids who grow up to face their childhood together (see also "It", "Stand By Me" and others). King is an interesting guy in that way -- you could say he is unoriginal, but at least we know what his motifs are.Richard Roeper commented that "not since Death to Smoochy have so many talented people made such a mess of things." In fact, director Lawrence Kasdan said the film's flop stature wounded his career and derailed future projects he had with Tom Hanks. This is quite a blow, considering the film did not lose money, he had four Oscar nominations under his belt and that Kasdan had the background of writing two "Star Wars" films and "Raiders of the Lost Ark"...I did not think it was that bad. If anything bad can be said, the film is a bit long for my liking, and the removal of fifteen or twenty minutes might have really helped. The non-linear storytelling also seemed to hurt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four friends hole up in a cabin deep in the snowy woods, only to find themselves in alien territory-- literally. Aliens have crash-landed in those woods and are parasitically invading and/or devouring humans. These are very bad aliens. The first half of the movie is good at building the plot and creating some suspense. The second half crumbles as the plot line turns into a standard monster movie. We also get several scenes with the friends as kids, which are reminiscent of scenes from other King films such as Stand By Me and It. Not for children under 12. The gore quotient is minimal but nasty. A young Jason Lee is one of the friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun ride full of plot twists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among the movies which are generally poorly reviewed and hated for reasons I cannot understand, Dreamcatcher immediately pops into my mind. I haven't read the book, apparently it goes much deeper, making this adaptation understandably disappointing for those who have read it, but this film is also greatly criticized by the average bloke who hasn't read King's novel. And I can't grasp why.The movie is imaginative, humorous, gory, and entertaining to the very end thanks to a regular dose of plot twists and high originality. What's not to like? I'm the first guy to get bored at most movies. I can't bare bland action films, and often need to force myself to finish a movie. I'm also a sci-fi enthusiast, and Dreamcatcher is far from being my first movie experience in that genre. Some people find it ludicrous, or "so bad that it's funny". That's not at all how I felt watching this film (which I must have seen 3 or 4 times by now), and I was actually surprised when I found out how disliked or mocked Dreamcatcher is. It's very well filmed, the visuals and effects are good, the acting is strong, the humor and shock value are perfectly balanced, and there's nothing cliché about it. On the contrary, it's refreshingly original! If you want a bland cliché film, which is so bad that it's funny, watch Shooter (with Wahlberg), which inexplicably has a 7/10 average rating on IMDb, whereas the rare gem that is Dreamcatcher hardly has a 5.Dreamcatcher is entertaining and fulfilling. It doesn't take itself too seriously while not being cliché teen horror film like The Faculty. Dreamcatcher provides much needed originality which I hadn't seen before. It's comparable in style to the 2006 film Slither, only it's much better. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreamcatcher (2003)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Dreamcatcher' is probably one of those most controversial of Stephen King's film adaptations, and probably disregarded most of the time, seeing as how they crammed a 800 page novel into a two hour film, yet I would definitely say it stays true to the novel, and one would probably have to have read the book to fully understand what is going on most of the time. However, rather than creating another epic 4+ hour mini-series like has been done so many times in the past, this polished features runs along nicely.The acting is great, I would say. It's nice to see Morgan Freeman playing a sinister role, and he does it well. The ending appears a bit rushed of course, however it didn't really need to be dragged out. I doubt director Lawrence Kasdan could have done much better. I definitely recommend this movie, but it doesn't go over very well.DREAMCATCHER ------ 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning: Film Much Worse Than it Appears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In lieu of a typical review, I will give you a synopsis of this celluloid travesty. Keep in mind I've never read the book but I did hear this film took liberties with it: Four friends; Henry (Thomas Jane), Beaver (Jason Lee), Pete (Timothy Olyphant) and Jonesy (Damian Lewis) make their way to a cabin in the snowy woods of Maine. In their youth the foursome stopped a group of bullies from forcing a mentally handicapped kid to eat dog feces. As a result their new friend Duddits (Donnie Wahlberg) gave them telepathic gifts.Strange things start to happen when they arrive at the cabin. While deer hunting, Jonesy finds a lost and very ill stranger. Meanwhile Henry and Pete get into a car accident while trying to avoid another stranger sitting in the middle of the road. Both strangers fart and burp...a lot. Pete's leg is injured and the car is totaled so Henry volunteers to trek towards the cabin.Beaver returns to the cabin and he and Jonesy witness a large migration of ill looking animals all being followed by a helicopter. Curtis (Morgan Freeman), the man in the chopper tells them to stay put. When they turn around they see bloody footprints leading to the bathroom. After a few moments, they break down the door to find a now dead stranger sitting on the toilet having just birthed a large, sharp-toothed parasitic worm. Beaver promptly sits on the toilet seat lid trapping the worm and tells Jonesy to find masking tape. Jonesy returns just in time to see Beaver being gnawed to death after attempting to pick up a toothpick from the bloody bathroom floor.Jonesy closes and locks the door but inevitably the worm escapes. When Jonesy turns around to run, he sees a giant angry looking alien who explodes into a red mist and takes over his body. He then hops on a snowmobile and disappears into forest. As Henry gets closer to the cabin he feels something is amiss and hides while a possessed Jonesy drives by.Meanwhile Curtis and his right-hand man Owen (Tom Sizemore) are part of a top secret military unit trying to quarantine the area which has been infected. They take helicopters to a mountainous area where an alien spaceship has landed and opens fire on them. Curtis apparently has first hand knowledge of their species. After blowing up the spaceship, they return to base to round up all people infected with the virus.Pete sits waiting for his friends to come for him when the stranger in his care dies and births yet another parasitic worm. Pete manages to fight the worm as it makes a meal of his ear, neck and penis. Mr. Grey,(the alien inhabiting Jonesy) soon finds Pete but Pete immediately knows its not his friend. Mr. Grey then forces Pete to use his superpower of "finding" things to find the highway. Jonesy who apparently still has a living consciousness tries to erase all memories of Duddits and his telepathic skills while trying in vein to save Pete, who is promptly killed for not cooperating. Jonesy however does realize Mr. Grey's plan to release the worms into the Boston reservoir.Meanwhile, after Henry battles another parasitic worm back at the cabin, he shows up at the top secret army base and uses his telepathic skills to unravel Curtis's plan to kill all in the quarantine. He then convinces Owen his superior is crazy and tells him to call in the regular army to halt it. They then hightail it out of there to pick up Duddits who Henry believes is the key to finding Jonesy. Curtis however is hot on their heels commandeering a helicopter and following them via tracking device.After picking up Duddits who suffers from leukemia, the trio head to the reservoir managing to get there before Mr. Grey can put a worm into the water. Curtis shows up for a show down against Owen who manages to shoot down the machine-gun toting helicopter with a pistol. Henry arrives just in time but is no match for Mr. Grey who leaves Jonesy's body. Luckily Duddits shows up just in time and transforms into an alien. The two extraterrestrials then kill each other. Jonesy wakes up, fade to black.If this synopsis peaks your interest by all means have fun. But for those of sound mind and body consider this a warning.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything is getting covered in Ripley's red stuff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher is one big mess of a movie, intermittently entertaining and with some good ideas buried under too much material that's, quite frankly, laughable.It's all about four friends who go for a holiday in a remote cabin and then find themselves caught up in the middle of a nightmare as the area is quarantined off due to alien invasion. These four friends are in trouble but, luckily, they all have a slight psychic link thanks to their childhood friendship with a young boy who was apparently mentally-challenged. Apparently. Oh, and a special army force is dealing with the situation too, led by a man who wants to eradicate everything first and ask questions later.The first thing I thought when I heard the first wave of negative reviews for Dreamcatcher was "why?". Why the hell would anyone read Stephen King's novel and think that they could make a decent movie adaptation of it? William Goldman and Lawrence Kasdan, who also directed the film, must have been feeling very confident on that day. Most of the novel, and indeed the film, takes place inside the heads of the main characters. Which is okay on the page but not on screen.Other things that don't translate so well - people having telephone conversations with any object to hand, a mentally-challenged character being played by Donnie Wahlberg in some poor make-up and using the horrible speech pattern written for him by Stephen King, an overuse of catchphrases, and . . . . . . of course . . . . . . the s**tweasels.The actors do their best with what they're given. Jason Lee is okay, Timothy Olyphant is as great as ever, Thomas Jane is okay and Damian Lewis actually does very well with the biggest role, moving between American and English accents. Morgan Freeman is good value as the determined military leader and Tom Sizemore puts in the kind of solid performance that makes you wish he hadn't fallen from grace.Dreamcatcher tries to handle some ridiculous material with a straight face and, largely, fails. Yet a strong half hour just before the ridiculous finale almost drags you in to what feels like a good film. That, and it's good cast, is why it just scrapes an average rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the movie, not knowing it was a King novel, and figured it had something to do with Native American Folk Lore, with a name like Dreamcather and all. I was wrong. Really wrong. When it was all over, I realized I had sat through a glorified sci-fi channel flick. I was rolling with the plot for a while, and then it just kept getting more odd and more like a B-horror rather than a thriller that it sought out to be. The point where the alien was possessing the main character and using a British accent to distinguish himself from...himself really, I was done. I through in the towel and just watched it for laughs. I had a better time doing so. It should have been called Ass-Worms from Space. Although, no one would have watched it if it was called that...good call Stephen King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dreamcatcher proves that it is very challenging to adapt a Stephen King book to screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher is about 4 childhood friends Jonesy, Henry, Pete, and Beaver. They all share some kind of telepathic bond which was given to them by their mentally retarded childhood pal named Duddits. In their adulthood they meet up together once a year for an annual trip in a snowy forest, to go hunting and drink lots and LOTS of beer. However on their trip they soon realize that the forest they are camping in is quarantined, because of some strange alien invasion. The "slowly-going-insane" Colonel Curtis (Freeman) and Lt. Underhill (Sizemore) lead the search and destroy mission, to get rid of all the aliens. Soon Jonesy has his body inhabited by an alien named Mr. Gray, who has a dodgy accent, and is hell bent on discovering the secrets of Jonesy's mind. The friends now struggle to survive, while meanwhile trying to not only figure out what is going on in the woods, but also with their own telepathic minds.While reading the book Dreamcatcher I was fully aware there a movie made of it, and was intent on watching it. But as I read I realized that with all the story lines and underlying meanings in the book, it would be extremely hard to accurately translate Dreamcatcher to the screen.As I began watching the movie, it starts off very well in its development of the characters and their bond. The actors are all good at first, but it is later on they transcend into corniness (Funny word, if it is a word). Morgan Freeman is probably at his worst in this film, but then again his character is not very worthy of praise either. The film has brilliant cinematography and truly captures the weird atmosphere of its blizzardy tree-filled forest.However the inevitable happens when all that was once interesting comes to a halt. The slimy, sharp-teethed aliens come into play. There are 4 kinds that we see: We get the skinny human form like aliens that soon morph into huge slimy and grotesque monsters, Smaller arm-size snake like aliens that lay eggs that hatch creepy crawly worms, and also the red-gold mossy substance that grows inside the aliens and on human blood. These disgustingly repulsive E.T.s may invite gore fans, but to me it was stupid to make them so nasty looking. I can understand the violence, but the grotesque nature I cannot understand. The aliens are supposed to be smart right? Smart enough to create ships that can fly all the way to Earth right? Smart enough to be able to fix together plans to conquer our planet right? So why do they have to be so damn slimy, grimy, stinky, and gross? I can't understand how creatures that look like this could ever get to Earth in the first place. The aliens are the biggest downfall to Dreamcatcher, because although they have good CGI, it does not make them plausible to a sci-fi flick viewer like me.Dreamcatcher also tries to juggles too many stories for a 2 hour film. It is a story of friendship bonding, an alien creature feature, a military eradication story, and also a tale of spiritual telepathy and mind games (The one between Jonesy and Mr. Gray). The character Duddits is interesting at first, but the movie's ending ruins the characters, and barely makes comprehendible sense. The actors and script try to keep up but ultimately fall flat. Dreamcatcher would have probably benefited from being a TV miniseries, but maybe the book should just be left alone.Dreamcatcher is real proof that it is very hard, and sometimes damn near impossible, to adapt a Stephen King book to the big screen. Dreamcatcher looks very nice, has some good and decent performances, and an interesting premise. But it fails to have a clear message or mission, besides gory alien violence. I give Dreamcatcher a 2 out of 4. I guess it's a somewhat admirable effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bizarre mixture of thriller with science fiction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** out of ****Dreamcatcher is a movie that can be divided in two parts. In the first part we get to know the four friend characters who star in the movie: Henry (Thomas Jane), Jonesy (Damian Lewis), Pete (Timothy Oliphant) and Beaver (Jason Lee). They all have one thing in common: they can read people's mind and can speak to each other only by thought focus. Too bad that that's the only interesting part in the movie. It moves on to the second part where the four friends go on a vacation, six months later. And then the movie goes on a completely different path, which is something that with no doubt can be considered as a low point. When you get to know the characters of a movie, when you get to know them even better as the movie goes on, you kind of start liking them, at least sometimes. And you don't want anything bad happening to them, if they're good characters. In Dreamcatcher, these four friends are so connected to each other, that they almost seem like a family! In the beginning of the movie, as we see them, we know that they're already good friends, that they lived a life together, went through the good and the bad, only to meet the tragic end (and also, very unnecessary) that takes place in the movie. OK, let's get to this as soon as possible.Jonesy, one of the four characters, finds a mysterious man in the snow, and takes him inside his house. The man doesn't feel so well, so Jonesy takes care of him. Later Beaver arrives at the house, and after a couple of scenes, Jonesy and Beaver find marks of blood on the floor. Frightened, they follow the blood to the bathroom, where the sick man is inside, saying by all means he's not bleeding! Jonesy and Beaver break through and enter in a bathroom a la Silent Hill, with floor and walls all dirty because of the blood. Then one hell of a creature kills Beaver, but Jonesy manages to escape. So we get completely confused. Is this a movie which talks about the friendship of four people who have the ability to read people's mind or is it a science fiction movie where we get to see the unusual: aliens show themselves and someone has to stop them? Well... a little bit of both. That's why this movie is so screwy! It's a bizarre mixture of "Stand By Me" with "Alien" and with "Outbreak". As the movie goes on, another of the four friends gets killed by the villainous alien, and the other two must find a way to stop the creature. This also involves the army and even Morgan Freeman as the leader of the squad. This movie has a little in common with Outbreak (1995), where he also stars. There's a virus which spreads through the townspeople and some sacrifices must be made. That's when Freeman says one of the worst lines of the movie. He says that the idea of killing Americans, turns his stomach. All right. I get the picture. So you're saying that if they weren't Americans, you'd kill them without it turning your stomach, without remorse. OK, congratulations for you! Freeman, by the way plays the role of Col. Abraham Curtis, a man who is almost gone mad for his death wish of hunting aliens. He even tries to kill one of his comrades, only because he escaped from the military base by driving a car at full speed breaking through everything that would get in the way. Sure it was one of Freeman's weirdest roles so far. Overall, not a great movie. Watch it by your own risk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes Scary, More Frequently Silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It boggles the mind how a film can be nightmare-inducing in one moment and moronically silly in the next, but that is indeed what "Dreamcatcher" seems to achieve. Still, I admit that I genuinely liked the main characters (Andrew Robb as the young Duddits broke my heart) and I thought the acting was, for the most part, quite good (the exceptions: Thomas Jane, handsome and hunky notwithstanding, could stand to develop a personality, and Morgan Freeman, who usually lends a touch of class to whatever film he is in, is pretty disappointing -- Dude, what's up with them eyebrows?!). I always enjoy Jason Lee -- and he has one or two moments of real hilarity in this movie -- and Timothy Olyphant was sweetly endearing, but I was most impressed with Damian Lewis as Jonesy, who pulled off a pretty neat duality trick (I think the gimmick itself was cheesy, but Lewis managed to maintain his professionalism in the process). Not having read the book, I also enjoyed the idea of Jonesy's "Memory Warehouse" and the shots of him looking out of it at himself and onto some of the ensuing action. Positive comments aside, this film is an expensive mess, which is a bit shocking since one expects more from the likes of Lawrence Kasdan and William Goldman. Shame on you two for the ridiculous ending!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rushed...(may contain spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great thing about Stephen King's writing is, in my opinion, the way he gets into the heads of the characters. You know exactly what the score is with each of them, unless he doesn't want you to of course. This is why it's so hard to transfer his books into a decent film. There just isn't enough time to go into the detail required to allow the characters make sense, or set up various plot elements and so on.Everything in the whole movie feels rushed. Even some of the speech is spoken as fast as it possibly can be, leading to me having to rewind a little bit to try and catch what was said. Some things were obviously thrown together hastily to try and move the plot on (the real army just suddenly showing up to relieve Blue Boys operation, for example).The film also falls into the trap of assuming everyone who is watching it has also read the book. In my case, and probably a lot of others, this is true, I have read the book, and that's what kept me watching (because after the first 30 minutes, I really just didn't want to carry on watching).The acting is... passable. Certainly no fantastic acting, especially in a film where the characters expressions are a large part of the story, but it's not cringe worthy. Some of the scenes are also fantastically set up. The scene where Jonesy/Mr.Gray passes Henry on the snowmobile while Henry is hiding was almost exactly how I'd imagined it reading the book, and that wasn't the only scene like that.Overall, the movie just feels rushed, as I've already mentioned. The scenes are too short, I never actually felt attached to any of the characters, as I did in the book (I actually cried reading the book, I felt more like laughing while watching the film). The worst part for me was the ending. For those who have read the book but not seen the film, a short version of the ending would be "Duddits turns into an alien and saves the day". For those who haven't read the book or seen the film, a mentally handicapped guy turns into an alien and saves the day. It's just as bad if you haven't read the book as if you have.Given a bigger budget, perhaps to hire some better actors (Morgan Freeman was good but he just felt way out place in his role, and his character wasn't developed anywhere near enough), or perhaps just to turn the film into a series of films or TV specials (as The Stand was) because the actors did their best with the lines given, I believe (and the lines weren't great, and as with the rest of the film, they came out rushed). The whole film just needed to be about 3-4 times longer to get the full experience of the book.A good effort, but doesn't really do justice to the book, and if you haven't read the book the movie is just too hard to follow and incredibly confusing and dull. 5/10.</fullReview>

I mean they nicked the humans as hosts from Alien, the creatures taking human form from Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the inside head bit from The Cell, the mad military guy from almost anything. Even the flashbacks which was one of the best bits seemed a bit too close to Stand By Me. Its not as if they've directly ripped them off its just that the film contains so many elements that it appears they've just thrown everything in there to sustain the running time.The movie is still reasonably entertaining its just ridiculously over the top.</fullReview>

And the alternate ending on the DVD (though better) didn't help much. My biggest problem with it is that they took a wonderful character and destroyed him. Maybe I simply didn't understand how King wanted to portray Duddits, but from what I personally understood, they completely ruined it.

		<fullReview>I read the book while on holiday last year; Stephen King's novels are always great holiday reads. I loved the book.The cast of the film looked promising. Morgan Freeman and Damian Lewis are always worth watching.As others have noted, the film starts very well indeed. It's true to the book. [ And yes, in response to another reviewer, the belching and farting *is* in the book - in fact King makes rather more of it than the film does ]. I'd also agree that not much of the beginning makes sense unless you have read the book.Once the action starts, though, it all goes downhill.Damian Lewis switching between an American accent and his native British accent is a brave attempt to deal with the book's discussions between Jonesy and Mr Gray, but ultimately it doesn't work. Perhaps because the British accent is a bit hammy. [ Oh, and as an aside - I notice evil has a British accent. Again. ]The final multi-way chase between Kurtz/Owen/Jonesy/Henry/Duddits is in many ways the core of the book and it seems to be just thrown away in the screenplay. All the tension is gone.This film has the same problem as many adaptations of Stephen King's work. Much of it is ultimately unfilmable - his writing is always full of characters struggling with their own inner demons. In this story they're "real" but usually they're just internal arguments, and these never come across on film. Unfortunately, they're one of King's principal devices in building and maintaining tension.And that's why this, like so many others, is ultimately a disappointing translation of the book.</fullReview>

Morgan Freeman and Damian Lewis are always worth watching. As others have noted, the film starts very well indeed. It's true to the book. [ And yes, in response to another reviewer, the belching and farting *is* in the book - in fact King makes rather more of it than the film does ]. I'd also agree that not much of the beginning makes sense unless you have read the book. Once the action starts, though, it all goes downhill. Damian Lewis switching between an American accent and his native British accent is a brave attempt to deal with the book's discussions between Jonesy and Mr Gray, but ultimately it doesn't work. Perhaps because the British accent is a bit hammy. [ Oh, and as an aside - I notice evil has a British accent. Again. ] The final multi-way chase between Kurtz/Owen/Jonesy/Henry/Duddits is in many ways the core of the book and it seems to be just thrown away in the screenplay. All the tension is gone. This film has the same problem as many adaptations of Stephen King's work. Much of it is ultimately unfilmable - his writing is always full of characters struggling with their own inner demons. In this story they're "real" but usually they're just internal arguments, and these never come across on film. Unfortunately, they're one of King's principal devices in building and maintaining tension. And that's why this, like so many others, is ultimately a disappointing translation of the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disappoint Stephen King Movie I really expect more it hard for me to accept that King wrote this movie it not the worst of his movie but it just about close. Okay it has a good solid cast of actors but even they couldn't save this lifeless movie and yes the special effect are good no thank to Stephen. I am big fan of his written when it good this however is not one of his best and it special effect is not enough but apparent someone think it is what this movie really need what the word oh yeah a story line! I would not rent this again better to wait and see it on television anyway that were all the lousy movies in up at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Rating: ** out of ****. Dreamcatcher is not as awful as I have heard but it is pretty damn disappointing. It starts out well but near the end of the first hour it gets pretty dumb. Then we have another hour and ten minutes to go.The first 45 minutes of Dreamcatcher are intriguing. We learn a little about the characters, there is some beautiful photography, and there is a well executed scene (in terms of suspense). The bathroom scene was suspenseful and well directed, even though the character did something really dumb (Whats more important: Toothpicks or your life?).Unfortunately, as soon as we get the first glimpse of the aliens, the film is less successful. The special effects aren't horrible but there not that convincing either. The film also has some lame attempts at humor. The people who have the aliens inside them start farting. I'm not sure if thats in the book (I have never read it) but its not funny and its kind of awkward here. Also, one of the characters starts speaking in an annoying British accent (He has a huge alien inside him. I guess that kind of explains it).The film is also way too long. Dreamcatcher could have been at least 20 minutes shorter. The plot is really hard to follow and a little trimming would have have helped.The acting isn't great either. Its not bad by any means, but no one is exactly memorable either. For the most part, the actors do adequate jobs. The exception is Morgan Freeman. Freeman's performance is really disappointing. His performance is extremely lethargic. This is easily the worst performance I have seen from him. Dreamcatcher is by no means a good movie but I don't feel it deserves below a ** rating. Yes, it is a flawed film and the ending is cheesy. However, it does not have enough "god-awful" moments to be considered a horrendously bad film(at least in my opinion).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Possible spoiler about one particular scene*I wasn't that pleased with the film, but I read the book first. And, just to clear up any confusion, I'd highly recommend reading the novel first, THEN renting the movie. Because the film does leave out information that the book produces, and anyone that hasn't read the book can get very easily confused. For example, there seems to be some confusion about Beav and his toothpicks...in the novel, that is easily explained and makes more sense in the bathroom scene. Films usually generally leave out more information if one is being made about a novel.I'd give the film 5/10, but the book 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This wasn't as bad as some reviews indicate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SPOILERS BEWARE)Sure, it seemed like a big budget TV movie and there are some slow parts, but that seems to be the norm with Stephen King movies. It's about 4 friends, who save a retarded kid from bullies, and become his friend. Duddits teaches them things, like how to read minds. Now to the present, they go on a hunting trip and an alien ship crashes in the forest. And these guys aren't friendly. They turn into these ugly worm-like creatures with sharp teeth. One of them catches"a ride" on one of the guys, Jonesy, in order to try to escape the quarintined area. The creatures kill 2 of the friends and it's up to the fourth, Henry, to read Jonesy's mind to try to find him. And at the end, we learn Duddits true reason to be on earth, but it is given away earlier in the film.I thought the special effects were good, but the acting was nothing great. And why would Morgan Freeman take such a small, dumb part.FINAL VERDICT: If you really like alien films, then you may want to check this one out. But the average movie watcher probably won't think it is too good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who ever said this was the worst movie is entitled to their opinion..BUT my opinion is that they fortunately have not seen many movies. This is a good movie to look at on cable on a lazy day. Just like I saw it. It was on MaxDirect so I had the luxury of rewinding. I must admit so many movies have ben so bad lately I am afraid to waste money to see them in the movies. Spoilers ahead!!! A lot of this flick made no sense, like if these cats can see things how come they could not figure out what was coming to them in that cabin? Why haven't they talked to this Dunizt guy it seems for years? Heck if he gave me a special gift I like that I would see him all of the time. Especially if I had questions about what was happening. I do think they made him retarded so he would be unassuming to everyone. And I do think in the movie he was a Alien. But why didn't he just go after the bad aliens instead of using a misguided Morgan Freemans character to do it? And what was the importance of that Scooby Doo lunch box? Or was it a bad attempt at product placement? I liked the friendship between the guys. And that they were not some snot nosed little kids. It was not a great flick but far from being my worst list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two confessions first: the last Stephen King novel I read was 'Insomnia', at which time I decided he was just repeating himself, and starting to lose it. Secondly, I have very low standards for adaptations of Stephen King HORROR novels. All of the good or great King adaptations (Misery, Green Mile, Hearts in Atlantis, Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me, etc) have been dramas, or the supernatural theme has been downplayed.So, how to approach this film. First I expect it to be ordinary. It is, though there have been worse SK adaptations. Secondly, it is hard to review in any sensible detail without including spoilers, since the thing is in part a mystery. I think I can say this much without giving anything crucial:For the first half it is a supernatural mystery film. For the second half it is a monster movie. The first half works pretty well. The second half doesn't.Four thirty-something guys have returned every year for 20 years to an isolated cabin in the woods (presumably in Maine, though some of the wildlife shown seemed a bit dubious for that location). There is a mysterious link with a childhood friend who appears to have been mentally subnormal. The flashbacks to this period are strongly reminiscent of 'Stand By Me' (even down to an encounter with a train). Actually by halfway through the film seems to have borrowed atmosphere from everything from 'Close Encounters' to 'Outbreak' to 'Alien'. A lost stranger turns up at the guys' cabin, apparently frostbitten, and suffering from some ominous intestinal problem caused by eating berries in the woods. From here on everything goes to hell, both for the friends, and for the film in general.the second half turns into a B-grade horror flick, in which Morgan Freeman is given such awful dialog that at times he actually appears to be the worst actor in the movie. Fortunately most of the rest of the cast acquit themselves adequately.I don't know what the King novel is like - almost certainly better, I presume - but the movie successfully conjures some nice atmosphere and supernatural mystery in the first hour, only to rapidly become very ordinary when the 'secret' is revealed. About the only good thing I can think of to say about the second hour is that there are some quite clever scenes involving representation of memory as a physical place, but I'm sure this was King's idea anyway.5 out of 10. Not a total bomb, but could have been above average if it had maintained the sort of mood of the first half.</fullReview>

The CGI was decent, and anyone who can't understand why a toothpick could be important someone like Beaver's character doesn't fully understand that humans are full of quirks. The characters were well done. The only things I would change in the story:1) More Dudditz. Walberg was excellent and very absorbed in the role.2) Don't know if Morgan Freeman fits the bill as Curtis. I always pictured Lee Ermey as perfect for the role.3) maybe just a bit more backstory on the friends. The five were fun to watch and drove this story. They are the best element.Overall, some things could've been better, but you get that with any adaptation. I enjoyed it7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS* I've read the book by Stephen King and felt that the film makers could have done a MUCH better job. It is just bad, bad, bad from start to finish. The ending was the worst in movie history, with literally ZERO tension.Let's start at the beginning. Four childhood friends, go off to a Maine cabin for deer shooting. While there, they take in a sick man, while two of them discover a traumatised woman sitting in the middle of a forest road. At least this part is credible. However, the transition from arrival to meeting the sick guy, to the other two discovering the woman is just WAAAAY too fast. There's no development, only snapshots of what's happening. Then almost after that, the s***weasels arrive in the movie. Again, the pace is atrocious. It seems like the film makers were more concerned by wowing the audience with story than working on plot and tension. They've sacrificed these two important elements for entertainment.The Mr Gray alien was okay as a CG character, but the main thing that got me in the stomach were the eyes on mr Gray and the byrum. They're yellow, and I would have expected slanted boot button eyes, like the Roswell 'aliens'.Morgan Freeman as the General of the Squadron was bad casting. I'd have expected a steely man with grey hair and icy blue eyes, with a grim face. And the General's craziness wasn't displayed well.Okay, now the ending. Decidely the worst. The ending in the book was neatly crafted so Duddits went peacefully and the tension was immense. Better to see Mr Gray try to stuff the dog down the shaft than the byrum to come out. And the mind play in the hospital with Jonesy literally killing Mr Gray in his mind would have been MUCH MUCH MUCH better! Can we have a remake????? The alien ending was SHOCKING!!!I know I have taken some elements to pieces and nit picked, but I really did not enjoy this movie at all, based on how wrong it all seemed.1 out of TEN. It left me feeling really empty, so much so that I cancelled my friend coming over to watch it with me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>curiously entertaining Alien B-movie comedy drama mystery thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher is somewhat of a strange film. Starting off as the mystery of four adults with a strange telepathic ability, which seems to stem from a childhood meeting with a young boy. Then halfway through, changes in to a completely different film. Personally, I am inclined to say that I really liked the film as a whole. In much the same way as "From Dusk Till Dawn" changed from road movie to vampire movie, Dreamcatcher attempts to confuse the viewer with a constantly shifting genre. From flash back drama, through 'guy' comedy, through mystery past war movie and into the area of b-movie alien flicks. It seems obvious to say, but I guess that this is a story that was pened when Mr King was a little under the influence as it has similarities in narrative pace to Naked Lunch. It also struck me as obvious that the key to the film, is infact the title. As in fact the 'dreamcatcher' has little to do with the actual happenings within the film. Rather the film itself plays like a dream, or moreover a nightmare. Rapidly changing situations, paranoid dillusions, voices in the head and alike. For that reason, the unbeliveable situations make sense.I would perhaps not recommend this film to those with a 'conservative nature' as I am sure that watching this film in the comfort of your own home with a 'hightened state of mind' would indeed be very enjoyable, if not entirely confusing.And by the way, there are also very good special effects to be found here, and a great picture quality. With a strong cast to back it up.Films should attempt to challenge the genre and push the boundaries. As a screenplay from a book this is exactly what Dreamcatcher does. And I like it for that. though I would question if this film would have been made were it not from Mr Stephen King however.4/5</fullReview>

It? The Tommyknockers? All here and all stolen.The main trouble with translating a King book to screen is character development and tension. What works in a 300 page book does not work in a 2 hour film. (Unless you have a genius like Kubrick directing)King films are like martial arts films...only fans will appreciate them....every now and then one comes along that transcends barriers. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The Shining.I enjoyed this film....King films tend to have a Walton Mountanish heroism about them, but you can forgive him for that usually. What you cannot forgive him for is his persistent inabilty to oversee good translation to the large screen. You sometimes wonder about his artistic credibility when he sells out his work so cheaply sometimes.We can talk about the underlying racism another time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hard to believe this was based on a Steven King book. Well, actually it's not, because this is actually pretty creepy at times.In short, it's the heartwarming story of four childhood friends, played as adults by Jason "Mallrats" Lee, Thomas "the 2nd Punisher" Jane, Tim Olyphant, and Damian "Band of Brothers" Lewis, who were given psychic powers by an odd child they were kind enough to help out one day and they celebrate their friendship with him (played as a frail, dying adult by Donnie Wahlberg) by heading up to a cabin for some male bonding on the weekend. Unfortunately for this Fantastic Foursome, they encounter flatulent aliens hellbent on taking over the world by spreading their unwholesome spawn and a mad military man in the form of Morgan Freeman, and his not so mad henchman, played by Tom Sizemore. Chaos and mayhem ensue. It starts off being a claustraphobic tale of men separated from each other in the woods but then tries to become a "save the world!" film and falls apart.Jason Lee, the hero of so many Kevin Smith films, isn't really in the film all that long and Timothy Olyphant's character isn't well defined. Morgan Freeman's actually hard to take seriously on account of his hair, and Sizemore isn't really fleshed out either. Some decent acting from Damian Lewis and Thomas Jane keep this one from being a total waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly awful. I'm going to spoil the plot of the film shortly, if that were at all possible.First, this film follows the traditions of Stephen King's TV Movies - The Stand, The Tommyknockers, The Langoliers - in being quite poor. However, even knowing how bad this film could be, I wasn't quite prepared for it. It starts off promisingly, following some seemingly psychic friends about their daily lives (anything supernatural is a good start), but then turns into a poor alien B-movie. Think lame X-files, and you get the gist.Second, the quality of production is awful - the CG, the script, the acting (there's a split personality to rival Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin), the botched use of flashback. From watching the DVD special, it's also apparent the crew thought they'd forged a masterpiece.But, to top it all off, it's really just not a very good story in the first place! (Cue plot giveaway) King's aliens only need to find water to take over the planet, but despite 25 years (at least, according to Morgan Freeman's psychotic general) of trying, they failed to land a ship in water, on a planet that is 70% surface water?!!Unless you really are desperate to see something new, you'll be more rewarded the Thing, Aliens, Predator, Men in Black, or probably any other film where aliens attempt to conquer our planet. If this is the current standard of the film industry, maybe we'd be better off under alien control...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I quite enjoyed Dreamcatcher because i had read the book and unlike most adaptations it is almost identicle but because it is true to the book this might make the film look a little silly to a veiwer who has not read the book. For example we didnt really need to see the memory rooms of Jonesy although important to the novel it wasnt to the film and could have been shelved also the film fails to explain the Duddits thing very well and that could have been scaled down a little. I also think that Morgan freeman did not suit the role of the Head of the Blue Squadron. He was supposed to be evil but i dont think Morgan has thit in him to play the role. Despite these criticisms i still liked the film and thought it looked superb . It's about time some computer gore actually looked real unlike some poor attempts recently i have seen in films.

		<shortDescription>Steven King should get out of comedy and into bad horror movies (see attached spoiler).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never imagined that Morgan Freeman would be stupid enough to come within even 10 miles of any studio that would film such crap - Let alone take a 40-year-old gyrocopter with a mini-gun into battle against extraterrestrials with intergalactic travel capability and serious mind control issues. Late in the movie, in a fit of brilliance, the Morgster shoots Tom Sizemore as he is about to save the world from certain doom. Fortunately, a morphing, terminally ill retard named Duditz was there defeat the evil Mithter Gay with passive resistance-style alien martial arts. Duditz somehow manages to inherent his Earth mother's ability to reason(nurture vs. nature). She dresses him up in an ugly sweater, packs his vital medication into a 30-year-old lunch box, and sends him out to fight aliens in an attempt to take his mind off the fact that he's going to die any minute from his lymphatic leukemia. Thank God that the aliens didn't wait even one more day to crash on earth because Duditz would've been dead by then. It's also too bad that Duditz's clairvoyant alien tribe hasn't had any more success curing autoimmune disorders than we have. And if you've ever thought that it would hurt to have four fingers bitten off your hand by an alien - well, you're wrong. Jason Lee not only demonstrates that this is not painful, but that you can still expressionlessly punch the finger-biting alien with your bloody stumps. This movie is like a sci-fi sequel of 'Revenge of the Nerds'; only they are psychic nerds that end up losing their cliquish charter. Rumor has it that this movie will be re-released under a different title at least once a year - Look for it as `Carnivorous, Tundra Snailiens' next year, `The Wicaboys', and `Bungholio Dawn' after that. King should do a follow-up to this movie in which Duditz returns and has to fight David Blane for a job in a Jim Rose's circus. The continued success of Steven King's movies is an impending sign of the apocalypse. It should be mandatory for people who brag they've read all of Steven King's books that they have their IQs (minus the 40 point handicap) tattooed on their foreheads.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a horror movie like "The Shining". Obviously the director is very, very good but his understanding of the horror genre is almost inept. Dreamcatcher has a few good scenes - those scenes are very good, but otherwise it is extremely poor and fails to create any suspense. The tale by Stephen King is the same run-of-the-mill which King produces 1000 of pages of every year. We saw it all in "It" and don't need to see it again. What really annoys me about King is that the strange and alien is always so, so evil - while the normal (American) is always so good. This is a very low way of perceiving the world. Clive Barker (and Richard Laymon) are light-years ahead of people like King and Koontz. King go home!</fullReview>

He puts moments of absurd humour in the middle of genital-clutching terror, and generally keeps unpeeling things long after you get a glimpse of what's going on, so that suspense turns into deep appreciation of the story as it unfolds.

		<fullReview>In dealing with all book-to-cinema translations, one ends up with two distinct audience groups: those that read the book, and those that didn't. The book-readers will need less explained to them, while the other group will have less high or detailed expectations. Particularly with Stephen King book-movies, directors have the hardest time in making a smooth translation. Time and time again, they fail to make the right choices in picking out what must be told and shown and what can be left out.Dreamcatcher, unfortunately, is no exception. The book-reader sees too little of the all-important relationship between the four friends and their "Duddits" visualized; their problems, piece-by-piece, are told at a dizzying pace; Colonel Kurtz's (oh right, that's "Curtis": I guess "Kurtz" was too complicated a name *groan*) brooding madness is laid bare in two seconds; Lieutenant Owen's character development is swept under the carpet, turning one of the novel's heroes in a pointless strawman; etcetera, etcetera. Meanwhile, the general opinion of the audience that didn't read the book seems to simultaneously be that the story receives far too little explanation, while the movie is overly long-winded. A sure sign that the screenplay was not written well enough.Dreamcatcher's point is to show a more realistic version of, and human reaction to alien invasion, and simultaneously show the power of childhood friendship enduring into adulthood. The latter is killed by speed; the former falls short as the director seems more interested in showing flashy action and creepy monsters. Which is exactly the kind of cliche King tried to avoid.Speaking of cliches, the movie starts off good and fizzes out halfway through. The famed "bathroom scene" is indeed fantastic (and highly suspenseful I imagine, if you didn't read the book). Like many other aspects of the story, the aliens' attempt at looking harmless is not exploited enough. Good moments, like Jonesy's cracking a sudden smile as "Mr. Gray" surfaces, are followed by bad ones, like the usage of the cheap "swoosh" sound effect whenever Mr. Gray is close to revealing his true form (which is a horrible director's mistake, every single time). Much like the choice to change the book's name "Kurtz" to the movie's "Curtis", the poor British accent including cockney slang that Jonesy puts up whenever Mr. Gray surfaces is a scandalous insult to the audience's intelligence; clearly the director feels that this was a clever way of cueing the rabble on when the alien's talking. Take a note from Gollum, please. The ending witnesses an absurd revelation about Duddits and then comes to a crashing, abrupt halt, though in the movie's defense, there were some serious flaws in the book's ending too (namely that King employed the unforgiveable "closing dialogue epilogue" between the surviving characters, which explains everything the story so far didn't... think characters sitting around the fireplace when one suddenly bursts out and says "One thing I still don't understand...").Still, the curse of King movies endures. Perhaps as a miniseries this movie would've done better, though time was certainly not its only weakness. I shudder to think what's been/being done to Desperation and Bag of Bones as I write this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining -- ignore the critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie not expecting much, given the critical thrashing it received when it opened at the box office. I was surprised to watch a decent science fiction/horror story that works on most levels. While certainly not the best adaptation of Stephen King novel, it is certainly not the worst. Having read the book, I guess it helped to understand what was going on but I think even if you haven't read the novel I think you will be entertained. One quibble: having Jones's character slip into a British accent to represent Mr. Gray ? why not use the `memory warehouse' as effectively as King did in the book? And Mr. Gray's ultimate motive seems ridiculous given the alien's capabilities (but that was the fault of the book's author, not the screenwriter). In any event, I would recommend this movie to any horror fan and would ignore the critics on this one. 7/10.</fullReview>

I figured that Morgan Freeman was in it so how bad could it be?This movie is horrible....I watched it with my friends and shut it off half-way through because it just wasn't worth enduring it any more. I have not read the original Stephen King novel, so I don't know if the problems are with the book or William Goldman's screenplay - yeah, he went from writing "true love" in The Princess Bride to writing true crap in this movie.The acting wasn't good. The effects weren't good. None of us were able to make sense of the storyline as we were all new to the story. I'm big into horror films (not slasher films though) and Stephen King movies (I love IT, Carrie, both versions of the Shining, etc.), so for me to hate this movie should hopefully be revealing.AVOID!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before seeing this film, I had no prior knowledge of the plot. I was simply told that this was a scary movie "that could actually happen". I now wonder whether or not the person who made that comment smoked crack 5 minutes before telling me that. If I were to jot down a quick synopsis for you, I am sure a few eyebrows would raise when told of the method used by these aliens to habitat and take over planet earth. You'd probably be pretty paranoid the next time you ate Mexican Food. The main hero of the story obviously reigned supreme at the Special Olympics and has a fondness for Scooby Doo who is always an honorable mention in a Science Fiction flick. If you have a vivid imagination and enjoy far fetched tales of Alien Adventure, like Independence Day for example, then I think you'd enjoy this film. However, if you are a reality based person with even a smideon of taste, you'd do better to choose something with more substance. Of course, this would probably not include aliens of any sort, unless you chose Contact which I found to be more believable than any other movie with an Alien based story line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher may be worth a look if you are into a bit of gore, some occasional scary moments and some intrigue. Some of the movie is quite interesting and getting into the flow of the movie is natural. If there must be one thing said about this movie it is about the ending. I wont spoil it but I will say that it is one of the worst endings I have ever seen, it really begs to question what they were doing with this movie. If you are lucky enough to get the DVD version watch the original ending, it links in much better with the movie even though it is not as polished. Like many other movies based on Stephen Kings novels they all seem to initially set a good story and characters with good ideas but then fizzle out near the end, in this case the fizzling occurs near the middle and has a shallow gradient until the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointing Stephen King Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Stephen King adaptation tries to be too many things at once. A combination horror/science fiction/thriller, among other things, the film takes many twists and turns with little understanding by the audience. Only gradually do we piece together the significance of the handicapped kid and his relationship with his rescuers. The final surprise, regarding the handicapped kid, is just idiotic. It was an intriguing idea that we were never prepared for in the movie. Events occur in the movie and then the explanations play catchup. The acting and characterization in here was nothing special, as the story shifts back and forth frequently between characters so much that there's no time to really identify with anyone. There are several interesting ideas in here, such as attempting to shield memories in the library mind of one of the characters. However, they're lost in the lack of story exposition, characters without motivation, and overall length of the film. Something tells me that the book is much better than this. I'm not a King fan, but I've seen enough other adaptations of his work to know that this is not one of the better ones. After waiting 4 years, this is a major disappointment from director Lawrence Kasdan. *1/2 of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has problems, but they don't matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to explain why a movie so "bad" by ordinary measures remains a mesmerizing experience, and it's even harder to do it without spoilers. The uneven, wandering, genre-crossing plot is indeed bizarre, but often exquisitely so. The characters are all likable if seriously flawed. The odd story, the many interesting photographic vignettes, and some unique sequences that should not be divulged here, make this a worthwhile rental in spite of itself.We've all seen similar menacing-monster effects before, but these have a peculiar rawness that sets them apart. (You can't really appreciate the complexity of a beast that seems to be mostly teeth-and-evil until you see it rendered.) Parts of the film are terrifying, and while there is a LOT of carnage, virtually all of it is filmed skillfully so that the Gasp Index is high, but flat-out gratuitous on-screen gore is minimal. I like that. Finally, after a short while one is always aware of a second layer of reality &amp; telepathy that is executed well.The user-ratings graph for this film is all over the place, so obviously not everyone reacts the same way. (I haven't seen such an inconclusive distribution since Blair Witch...)I recommend seeing it on DVD for the alternate ending, which I preferred. It's much sadder, but less cheesy in that it forgoes the saved-at-the-last-second triteness of the final worm-squishing.For some reason films set in New England are often loaded with geographical inaccuracies. Nobody in Maine would speak of driving south as going "toward Massachusetts" (which does not border Maine at all.) In the first scene that mentions the Quabbin Reservoir, it's said to be "not far" from the travelers' current position, which is presumably in southern Maine, and the dialog implies one could make the drive from one to the other in about 15 minutes. In reality it's over 100 miles. And much mention is made of a town called Derry, Maine, which does not exist but which is in fact the name of one of a well-known cluster of towns in southern New Hampshire, in an area very close to the part of Maine where this story takes place. Why this oddity was necessary I'll never know. If this seems like a small complaint, imagine how distracted you might be by a story set in a fictional Nevada town called Los Angeles, whose name was repeated several times per hour.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a growing class of movies of which the trailers are better entertainment value than the movies they represent. In any case, there is definitely a growing number of movies for which the trailers give a false impression. This film falls neatly into that category.The central flaw of this movie is that it did not know what it wanted to be. It was a fusion of [1] a buddy movie, [2] dark comedy [3] extra-terrestrial science fiction, [4] military paranoia, and [5] Stephen King sophomorish-teen-treehouse-dirty-talk movie. Of course, it never really achieved any of these. The title also implies a mystical native American occult element that never quite figures into the movie (not that I am complaining).I was eagerly anticipating this movie from the trailer, but I did not identify with any of the characters, and the story was just not compelling. ...But back to these trailers. Maybe I am just beginning to notice, but there are a lot of them just lately that have the "misleading" trait. More on this later....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is why Stephen King books should not be made into movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King is the greatest horror writer of all time, hands down. He has given us such masterpieces as THE SHINING, THE DEAD ZONE, THE STAND, IT and many many more.DREAMCATCHER was a phenomenal book. Over 800 pages long, I often questioned how they would take an 800 page book and make it into a 2 hour movie. Well they did and they did it badly. DREAMCATCHER is the reason why Stephen King books should not be made into movies. They took a great book and made it into a god awful movie not even worth the price of a three dollar rental at Blockbuster.Even with Lawrence Kasdan behind the reigns wasn't enough to save this movie. First of all, they did not develop any of the characters. Hence, you really don't give a good hoot who lives and who dies.Second, as in almost all SK translations to the big screen, the ending is changed. Sometimes they are changed for the better--see THE SHINING (1980). But here, the ending is very laughable. I remember seeing this film on opening night and saying out loud "you've got to be kidding me."This had the premise to be a good movie. A respected director, a great cast including Morgan Freeman, Tom Siezmore, Jason Lee, Thomas Jane, Timothy Olyphant. The main problem was William Goldman did a horrid job translating this to the screen. Save your money and rent either THE SHINING (1980) or THE DEAD ZONE (1983), two exceptional SK books that translated well into films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a question of representation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why and I don't know how, but I enjoyed this film. At first, I thought maybe the wonderful cinema in which I had seen it had been the actual reason for my liking: I mean, we don't have surrounded sound in our local cinemas. Not yet, anyway. But then I saw it again last night, without the thrilling sound, and it was still a fine movie. Maybe not the way I would have done it, but it was nice.The first actual issue I had was whether I would have a different opinion on the movie, because of reading the book, than the "general audience". Seems not. I probably understood more connections, but on the whole it didn't really effect the end result. I should've actually been outraged by how the movie ended, but as I think now, it's just a way to understand and interpret King's book and story.What was there not to like? Maybe the story wasn't as well rounded off as it should've and there was a big "nothing" in the middle of the movie. But the atmosphere was great! Don't you just love those boys meetings? They can be so cool and they just happen to be so here. Perhaps the "interpretation" I was talking about is a little bit over the edge, but it's acceptable. So I didn't really act surprised when I kept hearing "F***arow" and "SSDD". These expressions were part of their friendship, but I think Kasdan didn't really meld them well enough into the story.I think even Jonesy was a bit exaggerated. The "duel" between him and Mister Gray could've been even more interesting, not just a two faced, drunk and sober, Jonesy image. Then there's the fact that Freeman isn't used to being the "bad guy". I didn't see any real problem with him acting the bad boy here.The real bad side of this movie is the fact that it's too funny for the silly generation. I watched it with my parents and they weren't laughing at the farts as people in the cinema were. It probably was off the line, but it didn't really bother me. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say I usually love Stephen King's books. I have read all of them, but over the last few years the books are getting worse than the movies - this is a big problem.Dreamcatcher's storyline makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The plotholes are monsterous ***SPOILERS***The 2nd in charge in the army hapily takes a man out of a bone fide quarantine because he is convinced that this man (Henry) can read his mind. When you consider the fact that this same lieutentant was present when the aliens tried to converse with the army through telepathic abilities, and also when they changed from nice looking cute aliens to something out of, well out of ALIEN, then him immediately trusting anyone else with this ability is rather unlikely.***BIGGER SPOILER****The final scene when Duddits turns into an ALIEN makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Why he was dying of Cancer, why he was retarded and most importantly why, if he was a kick arse alien, did he allow some boys to beat him up when younger, is just a few of the problems here.That said this did have some good bits compared to the equally baffling book on which it was based.It summed up the 1st half of the story, using a clarity and concise use of images that would have served the book well.The tension generated in the first reel was quite good, only when we got to the coming of the army did the film completely lose it's way.At least we were spared the rather revolting and unnecessary detail given in the book for the first half.All in all a huge disappointment but one to be expected from all of those who have found that Mr King's horror just is not what it used to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stephen King movie adaptations are hit or miss... this one's a MISS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The very nature of most of SK's writing is that a lot of the evolution of the story as well as character development occurs internally within the characters or through flashbacks. This tends to make it very difficult to translate to the big screen. Only a few adaptations have really worked well on the big screen, Pet Sematary, The Shining, The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption come to mind immediately as triumphs of SK adaptations.That being said, there are also two types of viewers when dealing with movies adapted from published novels: people who have read the book and those who haven't. Viewers who have read the book can compare/contrast and also have a 'guideline' to carry them through the movie. I read the book.On to the movie (I will try to avoid spoilers, but what's the point):This was a terrifying mess of a movie. Characters were badly introduced, woodenly portrayed and hardly believable. Damian Lewis (who was truly awesome in Band of Brothers) is woefully miscast, as is Morgan Freeman, who is not a good 'bad-guy' character. Christopher Walken would have been PERFECT as Kurtz (inexplicably changed to Curtis for the movie).There was no rhythm to the movie. After 20 minutes of lead-in (with a amazingly flat and poorly acted flashback to the beginning of the relationship of the main characters), the movie staggers through some ludicrous action with very poor special effects. At one point in the movie when the terror is supposed to be screaming along, my girl actually laughed out loud and said "Okay, I'm not scared anymore". That pretty much sums it up.Those who have read the book will feel betrayed by the pacing, the ending and the ridiculous and forced dialogue, as well as the cheesy special-effects (although one of the monsters is pretty cool and creepy). Those who have not read the book will have absolutely no idea what is going on and not really identify with the characters, especially after the crummy flashback that really doesn't do anything to enhance the understanding of the relationships of the characters.My opinion is that this movie should never have been made. It's a prime example of Hollywood grabbing at straws and kicking to production any little thing that SK produces. Don't get me wrong, I am a long time fan of SK's work, but I've seen all of the movies ever written based on his stories and I'd say that it's a 50/50 crapshoot. Some of Stephen King's books are obviously never going to work as screenplays. This is one of them. In all fairness, no director could have pulled this off and made it work. Don't waste your time. You'll want it back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slipped off the tightrope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It must be hard to make a movie version of a Stephen King novel, with all its depth, complexity, and character development. In that sense, it must be like walking a tightrope. Having said that, it's not clear why so much was either changed or omitted that would have helped the gaping plot holes from which the movie suffers. In this regard, the movie slips off the tightrope and falls.It is possible to create a relatively good likeness of a book (see, e.g., Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), even one with as many characters as Dreamweaver has. Say what you will about HP, at least that movie was far more faithful to the spirit of the book.What the movie lacks is the existential trauma that Jonesy goes through with his schizophrenia, not to mention the tete-a-tete with Mr. Gray. The give-and-take between Owen and Kurtz (renamed Curtiss in the film) is utterly nonexistent, and Curtiss' insanity is completely emasculated by eliminating the near religious-level of allegiance he commanded from his troops. Each character exists as an island unto himself, despite the fact that the 5 friends rely heavily on each other for their own development. This leaves the viewer feeling somewhat disjointed from scene to scene as the characters seem to come to self-revelations without satisfactory explanation. This doesn't even begin to cover the atrocity (an assault on the sensibilities of anyone who has read the book) that was making Duddits an alien in the movieCurtiss comes off more mean than insane, which is not due to Freeman's performance but rather the script's complete lack of tension. Small touches, such as Duddits scoring the boys' cribbage games, would have helped the characterization immensely. The threat of the Ripley was completely ignored, as the revelation of its ultimate harmlessness in the greater picture would have helped underscore Curtiss' growing insanity. All in all, everything just seemed "too easy," as the movie tends to move lockstep in a pre- determined direction, when that uncertainty is nowhere to be found within the original story.I would like to recommend, however, that if you would like to experience a wonderful, entertaining dramatization of the book, listen to the unabridged audiobook read by Jeffry DeMunn. He not only does a phenomenal job , but the entire audiobook maintains the tension of the book to make it an actual experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made the Mistake of Reading the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to the book, the movie was a letdown. Many important parts were left out, and the end was stupid beyond belief. Why did the moviemakers feel they had to change it? Did they assume we weren't smart enough to understand?I was disappointed that the story of the nameless Russian girl was never mentioned or, for that matter, the fate of Richie Grenadeau. I'm no filmmaker -- but I suspect that, with skilled screenwriting, the significance of these events could have been blended into the plot with minimal time added. Another neglected subplot was the riot Henry incited within the makeshift concentration camp. (Oh yeah -- the thought of our government actually committing unnecessary mass murder was probably too politically incorrect to include. Our government would NEVER do THAT. (Can we all say "Sand Creek," kiddies?))I agree with O'Keefe that Morgan Freeman was wrong for the role of Kurtz (Curtis in the movie). Don't get me wrong; he's an excellent actor. However, while reading the book, I imagined Kurtz to be quite the stereotypical opposite. I visualized this character to be a corrupt version of Rambo's mentor, Colonel Trautman. Freeman was believably crazy, but not quite evil enough -- and I suspect that his being cast in the Curtis role had something to do with why the aforementioned concentration camp scene was cut. In the novel, Stephen King explicitly suggests Kurtz be played by Christopher Walken -- but I feel an even better choice would have been somebody like Robert De Niro or Tommy Lee Jones. Morgan would have been better as Kurtz' commanding officer, the three-star General -- though I totally understand why he'd turn the role down (fewer lines).By the way, Donnie Wahlberg was a cool surprise as Duddits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DREAMCATCHER isn't extraordinary. Nonetheless, the story is creepy and keeps you involved throughout. Furthermore, the performances are decent and Kasdan has an excellent visual grasp of the the material he's trying to portray. So all and all. I'd say worth the price of a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got the Dreamcatcher DVD for my birthday a few days ago and, being a Stephen King fan, I really looked forward to seeing it despite all the bad reviews I read.After seeing it I must say that I actually like it. For the most part I think it's very true to the book. One thing really bothers me though and that's the ending. I wish they had kept the original ending which is included on the DVD. It's so much closer to the novel.I rate it a 6.5, but would probably have rated it 7.5 or 8 with the original ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The biggest mixed bag of tricks EVER.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. The center plot it good, the alien plot is surreal, and the entire movie is more of an acid trip than anything. The tricks this movie throws at you is astonishing and done extremely well. While it obviously has its down sides, the acting was horrible; the down sides are irrelevant to what the movie was about to me. This movie was meant to send you can a ride and it did.The best part of this movie was the cinematography, which is beautiful. The huge camera spans of the Maine's frozen forests, the snow flakes drifting past the camera allowing you to see their shapes, and the scenes with the helicopters flying around was gorgeous. For me, this made the movie. The lack of pot reasoning is also what made this movie different. There is no real reason for the aliens to be there, but there they are.A perfect mix of horror and sci-fi that I haven't seen since John Carpenter's remake of "The Thing." Don't go into this movie expecting it understand it because you won't. It was strange, bizarre, scary at some points and an acid trip all the way through... I loved it!8/10</fullReview>

And not expect a lot of others things people have said bad about it.... Then you will be entertained. The wife and I enjoyed some suspense scenes through out the movie.

		<fullReview>see this film only if you want to see how the production missed agood chance to deliver a potential classic.i will start by saying the most irritating fact about this film: it had all the resources to become great. but it turned out to be a big mess. it is known that good cast/writer/director not always make up fora badly written plot. history has a lot of examples. also, it is a fact that stephen king(which i like to read) books are often look bad on screen. only 'misery' 'shawshenk' and 'stand by me' are the best movies that were made according to his novels.king's novels are hard to transfer to screen because they are complex. non the less, it is no excuse to make such a mess.there are several parts i didnt like ; - the farts and burps of the fat guy. was it really that nesessary?- why are the monsters come out anally , oh why ? - the british accent of possesed the Jonesy. please explain this. - the part when Jonsey's friend drive with the army man. he gets a"phone call", telepathically, from Jonsey. he then anwsers(?) it by holding his gun(!) as a head set, and speaks to it....i mean, he talks to the gun...come on! - morgan freeman can make roles of two faced persons, the kind you dont know if you should trust. why not using that potential instead of making him seem unconvincing as a crazed , murderous colonel ?on the whole, this film gives you the feeling that everybody just wanted to rap up and go home .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes when I am sad and depressed about my own life, I stop and thinking about this movie. Because no matter how bad my life is, at least I didn't make a movie about an alien disguised as a retard that saves the world while muttering lines from Scooby Doo. Yes, this movie has got to be the stupidest movie of all time. Then we throw in the most annoying actor of all time, that being Jason Lee, and a dweebish red-head that begins to talk with an English accent when he is taken over by the alien force. I don't know what it is about Jason Lee, but everytime I see him he is annoying. He just seems like a whiny dweeb. Seriously though, when I do stop to think about the ending of this movie, I have to laugh. If you see it, you will too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cool Stephen King adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score: 8.0 (out of 10)They say that authors really only have one story to tell. No where is that more evident than in Stephen King. A group of childhood friends coming together years later; catch phrases cornier than crude; references to actual recent movies and TV; someone sacrificing his life to save the group; a villain that can change shape or swap between bodies; gore galore; a physical manifestation of the inner mind of the characters; and, need we forget, telekinesis and/or psychic abilities - all the King staples are present and accounted for in `Dreamcatcher'.Still, despite all that, there is something distinctly un-King about this particular adaptation. `Dreamcatcher' both as a book and now as an alien invasion flick has a little more edge and is frankly just cooler than any King adaptation has been in years. This colliding hodge-podge of bits comes off like `The Faculty' meets `The Thing' meets `Stand By Me'. William Goldman's script approaches this material without pretension, acknowledging King for what he is at heart - a campfire storyteller of pure mainstream popcorn yarns. Better yet he mercifully cuts short the flatulence humor that King labored over in giddy childish detail for pages in his book. `Dreamcatcher' is just a rollicking good ride. Between all the snow (it's like a Christmas movie gone bad), the helicopters, the creative special effects, the deliciously conveyed gore and blistering viruses this flick has enough guilty pleasure trappings to satisfy my sci-fi indulgence.Kasdan, in particular, proves a surprise. Being the writer/director of lightweight character driven picture such as his previous `Mumford' (also featuring Jason Lee in a role to small for his talent), Kasdan disappears like a chameleon into the sci-fi/horror genera as if a seasoned pro - channeling John Carpenter in his cheekiest moods and showing an expert ear for tightly staging bits and atmosphere without relying on cheap false alarm jolts. He's stepped out of his territory here and proves he can swing with the best of them.And speaking of experts and chameleons, James Newton Howard's very different (slightly more techno than usual) original score is a knockout. It goes a long way from the get-go to establishing that hipper than the script attitude. Goldman relies on the creativity of the story - which has one nice revelation after another for us - and special effects leaving the dialogue weak and simple in a B-movie way. Mostly the characters just call out each others names and repeat their corny catch phrases. Typically this type of mediocre script is par for the monster movie course, but `Dreamcatcher' seems to want to be more. It wants to be a story about best friends and childhood bonds, but Goldman doesn't give us anything more than an outline of these 4 guys. I would hate to think that when Morgan Freeman discusses Americans as people who shop at Wal-Mart and never missing an episode of 'Friends' that he's describing the filmmakers' lowest common denominator view of this movie's audience.Damien Lewis, Thomas Jane (`Deep Blue Sea'), Timothy Olyphant (`Scream 2', `Go'), Jason Lee, Tom Sizemore, Morgan Freeman and an unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg (`Boomtown') all strap in for this ride. The chief problem with `Dreamcatcher' is that it doesn't have something for them all to do. It starts loosing it's legs in the 3rd act unable to fully deliver on it's rich set-up. It kills off people just to get them out of the way and tosses away plotlines that send the viewer wondering why they were there in the first place. Top billed Freeman makes a nice turn, but soon becomes utterly wasted.It's rare that King books and movies don't take the easy way out and disappoint in its climactic moments. Let's be honest, it's not his forte. He crams things together as if he's run out of steam and just wants to get it over with. When it all comes to fruition in this one even our heroes take a backseat to an apparent intergalactic war between aliens. While I can certainly understand the slighted rage purists of the book feel towards the radical liberties taken by Goldman and Kasdan, I enjoyed this ending. In a lot of ways it makes more sense and works on it's own level (although a part of me wanted this movie to take the metaphysical climax of King's `The Regulators`). For once, it was nice to see a King adaptation go out with a surprise and a bang rather then a limp whimper. Recommendable for those willing to go with it.</fullReview>

If you're able to separate preconceived notions of the genre of the movie and have a sense of humor, I think you'll find it very enjoyable.Not one of Kings best Novels nor one of the best film adaptations of his novels but I think that's a good thing for this movie. It has a life of it's own outside the novel. It has a little of everything which can be numbing but that numbing lets you experience the film in the way it was meant to be viewed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly boring pulp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains spoilersI have to admit that prior to watching this movie, I had absolutely no idea what is was about, but the title made me suspect that "Dreamcatcher" was some kind of psychological thriller. The first part of the movie further backed that idea, but then after about forty-five minutes the movie shows it true colours: it's a science fiction movie about extremely terryfying aliens. And not a very good one at that.Problem is, the movie pretends to be really deep but it's it really isn't . The plot suffers from all kinds of cliches like a group of friends that share a strange childhood experience (we've seen that numerous times before in Stephen King books and it gets really really old) and is generally very thin. Very little is explained, some scenes are utterly pointless (the helicopter raid on the UFO), and the whole movie feels highly unbelievable until the end where it comes COMPLETELY unbelievable. The lack in plot or logic might have been forgivable if the movie had been either a non-stop action hackfest a la "Starship Troopers" or a truly scary one like "Signs", but "Dreamcatcher" is basically very slowly paced and largely lacking in both suspense and action. With so little going on, the weak plot really stands out. Granted, the aliens are truly vicious, but everybody knows that real suspense comes from NOT showing things instead of making them very explicit. Anyway, Dreamcatcher is a slow sci-fi thriller with a seriously flawed plot and not much else to make up for that. * out of **** stars</fullReview>

SPOILER i'm not sure if it was intended but even the fact that there's a character who's nick name is joansie is immune to the alien is a reference. one bad thing about the movie is there is no resolution. the climax occurs and then 3 seconds later the credits are rolling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretentious, overdone (possible spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem I had with Dreamcatcher is the same problem I have with reading Stephen King. His plotting is ingenious and often compelling but his writing style is so verbose and overdone it makes him a difficult read. I didn't read Dreamcatcher but I have enjoyed many of his other books - you just can't re-read him.Dreamcatcher the movie is so bloated with style and pretension that it is not much fun though it should be. It nearly misses the fundamental plot point - four guys are primed in childhood to save the world as adults - because so much screen time is given to the exciting visual elements of the plot, like the relationships between the soldiers, and not enough to the relationship between the four guys and Dudditz. That's what interested me, especially considering who Dudditz turns out to be in the end. Too many of the key scenes collapse under their own weight. Director Kasdan seems to think the way to increase suspense is too draw every scene out. This is a classic technique that often works when the pacing alternates with faster scenes but he hasn't done it here and the film plays very slow, even the violent action scenes with the monsters.Dreamcatcher was fun for the first hour or so and all the performances are good, but it is ponderous and disappointing the rest of the way. It should have been directed by Hawks or Siegel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a complete mess except for the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big Stephen King fan and loved the book, so I was cautious when watching the film because it quickly acquired a bad rep. So I went in with an open mind, not really expecting much, and it turns out parts of the film are really really good. It's just a shame about the shambles of an ending which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and stinks of studio interference (some of it was indeed re-shot before release).First off, a film adaptation will never live up to a book no matter how good it is (see Misery or The Shining for examples). Something is always lost or watered down. It has to be to fit in a 2 hour movie. Dreamcatcher is actually pretty faithful to the book, apart from the changing of Duddits into a different character for no other reason than to tidy up the confrontation at the end, and Colonel Curtis just disappearing.As for the good stuff, Damian Lewis puts in a brilliantly oddball performance playing both Mr Grey and Jonesy a la Gollum in The Two Towers, having psychotic arguments with himself. And Jason Lee raises a smile with choice lines such as 'Kiss my bender!" and "What a f***erow", all taken from the novel. The FX are pretty decent as is the cinematography. It's just a shame about some of the acting (Duddits is just laughable - "Ello, 'ister Gay") and for once Morgan Freeman is truly miscast and is unable to say "Laddiebuck" without raising a giggle.So not a complete mess, but the ending almost destroys all the good, quirky stuff that comes before it. Read the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm new to this game, and I haven't read the book yet, but I plan to SOON. Anyhoo, you all seem to expect something great when Stephen King books are converted to movie. King's finest work in my opinion, IT, was a terrible movie. He is such a detail-oriented writer it's impossible to compress his books into the time frames of a big time Hollywood movie or a cheesey network mini-series. There have only been three movie adaptations of King books that are adequate: Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me and the Shining. None of these are true to the book, but I think they are the most faithfully reproduced in movie form. Lest we not forget the debacle that was Sleepwalkers. Anyhoo, I noticed I am the only one who can draw a parallel to IT. Much like the Tommyknockers losing their teeth, if you remember from King's 1200+ page litany on Derry, Pennywise is AKA Robert Gray, AKA Bob Gray, AKA IT (and technically AKA Mr. Gray). Secondly, when they do the smokehole thing, Bill and I think Richie go WAY back in time to see IT arrive on Earth. So, IT is actually an alien, so is Mr. Gray, and in theTommyknockers, etc. Now, in IT, the turtle helps the kids defeat IT. The turtle perhaps i Duddits or some other parallel could be drawn there. But...well, what do you think?</fullReview>

I think the made for TV "It" ran four hours. Too little time to develop the sub plots so the film charges from a relatively brief introduction to the first bloody deaths. You can still see the elements that probably make this a good book but an excellent cast is wasted. The quirkiness of a villain who should have been something like Nicholson from The Shining or at least Max Von Sydow from Needful Things wasn't there. Buy the book, avoid the movie.</fullReview>

There is a certain standard of excellence one can predict from all of King's adaptations to film. You have the bonded group put into a horrid situation and then you watch as the little group falls apart piece by piece. Dreamcatcher was no different. The best thing about its predictability is that those of us who enjoy a good Stephen King movie from time to time know exactly what to expect and never fear a let down.

Even though the basic plot is a bit far-fetched (typical Stephen King style), this movie makes it work wonderfully. Ten minutes into the movie, I was already hooked.Is this movie a thriller flick, or a horror, or a sci-fi? Yes! Dangerous ground, trying to be so many things at once. This movie succeeds. The same way THE THING succeeded, but much better.So many people said they "just didn't get it." Sorry, but if you couldn't follow this movie, better you should stick with Brady Bunch re-runs. As for the critics who blasted this movie, thank God this movie finally came along. Now I know exactly which critics I will never again consult.OK, I'll agree that the pistol/telephone thing was a little much, and may have broken the "real vs. imagery" boundary. But I'm giving the movie a 10 anyway. Given the ridiculously bad reviews it got, and the horrible reception in theaters, it more than deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Problem With Dreamcatcher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King writes two kinds of books, both of which I enjoy. Some are focused, tight narratives that follow a single thread...Cujo, Christine, Salem's Lot, Carrie, Pet Sematary, and others. Then occasionally he produces a multi-tier extravaganza like It or Tommyknockers, with dozens of characters (often multigenerational) and plot threads. Dreamcatcher, the novel, is one of the latter...it tries (with only modest success) to be a horror novel, science fiction, coming-of-age story, thriller, conspiracy theory, and a few other genres as well.A director and screenwriter faced with the challenge of turning a stew like that into a film have two choices.a) They can drop most of the plot threads and concentrate on two or three key narrative lines, or; b) They can try to keep most of the plot threads intact, and drop most of the character development.Donner and Goldman have chosen plan (b) in this case. What's left is an almost incoherent roller coaster that shifts time, pace, location, mood and characters with virtually every scene, without strong characters to tie it together. I can't imagine in makes much sense to anyone who hasn't read the book: and those who have will be disappointed at the absence of everything that made the book worth reading...the well developed childhood friends, the psychotic Kurtz (Morgan Freeman is much too humane), and mostly, an interesting and credible Dudditz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Substandard King Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have found that most of King's movie adaptations are, at best, substandard. The film compares poorly to the book in almost every instance. The film always seems so "flat" as in it pales in comparison to the picture that King paints with his words. I have been reading King's books for 12 years and with the exception of "Stand By Me" and "The Shawshank Redemption", the films are always lacking. I would like to see "It" put on the big screen, word for word. Yes, it would probably be 4 hours long, but I thing it would be well worth it. As everyone's postings are, this is just my opinion. Draw your own conclusions, but I implore those of you who have seen ANY of King's movies, get the book. King rarely disappoints.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone said that this film is for "diehard King fans." Well, I can tell you, I am a DIEHARD DIEHARD Stephen King fan. I love him, always have always will. I was a literature major in college and defended him to the end against literary snobs who think he's second rate. I think he's the best writer alive today. HOWEVER . . .that being said, I think this movie really sucked. First of all, most King movies either CAPTURE his voice, or they don't. This one did not even come CLOSE. It had none of his humor, sarcasm, or wittiness. It was just Terminator with a twist. The novel is so much better, with so much more depth. If you ARE a diehard King fan, read the book, but don't see the movie. It's a disgrace to the King. (hehe)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criticisms seem rather unfair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an avid fan of Stephen King books, I had mixed emotions about renting the DVD last night. I very much wanted to see Dreamcatcher, as I had both read the book and listened to the book-on-tape. I was not disappointed in the movie, and believe a lot of the criticism leveled at the adaptation are the same old retreads that often are brought against Stephen King book-to-movie adaptations Critics seem to universally praise (some of) King's non-supernatural movies (Misery, Stand By Me, Delores Claiborne) and rarely the supernatural ones (Carrie and The Shining [blech!!]being the exception to the rule). I guess critics want to be, ahem!, "challenged" by a movie and have decided monsters just don't fit their sophisticated palates. It seems the determining factor is the "name" director of the supernatural ones. Sure, Dreamcatcher was not a perfect movie, and the book itself was WAY too derivative of King's earlier works (elements of It, The Tommyknockers, Firestarter, and The Body all rolled into one), but it is always nigh onto impossible to adapt King perfectly to the screen. Too much "internalizing" is written into the books. I agree the ending was crappy, but the DVD shows the alternative ending; I found it more satisfying, though less razzle-dazzle. The obvious problem with the King adaptations is how do you reduce books, heavy on the thought processes of the characters, that run up to 1000 pages into a 120 minute movie? It is seldom done to anyone's satisfaction, though I was glad to see Dreamcatcher did handle this effectively (especially the Mr. Gray/Jonesy bits). Not the best movie ever, nor even the best King movie ever. But not NEARLY as deserving of the disdain it generated.</fullReview>

Very well drawn characters, a lot of mistery, intense moments. The end was good and it didn't dissapoint me like other horror movies. A script was good and I am very anxious to read the book also.

Then a stranger stumbles upon their cabin with what they think is frostbite, which is only the beginning of an invasion of alien worms that have come to contaminate the water system (and crawl up a human's rectum) along with their red mossy growth. Freeman is the insane, alien-chasing colonel soaring in his helicopter under government conspiracy duties (doesn't he know he's a long way far from the much better THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION?). It takes the single-handed mind behind BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID (writer William Goldman) to make another one of King's 800-some paged novels, this time an unintelligent, long-drawn-out, and distorted, not to mention very dreadful adaptation . . . the adjectives never stop. This time, no cameo from the recently retired author; he must've been ashamed.Running Time: 131 minutes and rated R for violence, gore, and language.RATING: * ? (out of ****)</fullReview>

Yeah, okay it wasn't what i expected, but it still is a good film. I think the aliens are cool, and the alien disease named "Ripley" taken straight out of the alien saga. It could have been a lot better but still it's better than nothing. One of the best scenes in the film is when army jets are trying to destroy a UFO, and the aliens are trying to shoot back. Great stuff. If you like horror movies with a twist see this one, but if your new to horror, then give this one a miss.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood actually follows a book!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May be some spoilers here, ladies and gents, not too sure myself what would spoil this one for you or not...When I first saw this, it suddenly hit me that the first half of the film was dead on with the book. "Holy Crap!" I said, "Hollywood's actually realized that Stephen King's storylines are better than anything their screenwriters could come up with!" I spent the next few hours enthralled by this epiphany...Near the end it strayed quite a bit, but I'd still say it was 90% accurate to the book. A lot complain that they skipped some parts of the novel (I was upset that they left out the "Pennywise Lives" graffiti from the novel), but unless you wanted a five hour movie, this is about as good as you're going to get. King translates best into mini-series because his books are so long, I think this was the best theatrical release of his work yet.The acting is all round great, with the four main characters being the main attraction, outdoing Morgan Freeman even. It was nice to see Jason Lee do some serious acting, because I hate his comedies and I knew he could do better. Thomas Jane (soon to be the Punisher from Marvel comics) was good as a suicidal psychic, Tim Olyphant played an alcoholic pretty damn well, and Damien Lewis was just amazing. Jumping back and forth from Jonesy to Mr. Gray was just terrific (and for those who don't know, the british accent is his real voice, he's not American).The ending is my only complaint. A bit abrupt and completely forgetting that this was once based on a book, though the special effects were pretty decent (this coming from someone who despises computer animation with all his heart). All in all, I give this one 8/10 stars, mostly because it followed the book so well. If only Hollywood could do a faithful adaption of Richard Stark and James Patterson, we'd see some damn fine movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth every penny, but you are going to need a drink or two.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my whole life I have never reached a point where I've watched too many movies. However, I am always reluctant to watch movies when my instinct tells me they will suck. Dreamcatcher was one of the movies that gave my instinct a lurch when I saw the first trailer. I couldn't figure out what the movie was about, as they pushed too many plot points out in a two minute preview. I didn't know if it was a serial killer thriller, or a sci-fi epic (however unlikely), or just another terrible horror movie. And to glue my opinion in place, I saw the tell-tale words "Based on the novel by Stephen King." I haven't seen a good stephen king book-movie adaptation since "The Dark Half", so i wasn't in any hurry to waste eight bucks on a ticket. However, a friend of mine convinced me otherwise. She outlined the whole movie over the phone, and after that I had no choice but to see the wonders she spoke of adapted to the screen, while at the same time, keeping myself from expecting very much. When we got to the movies (which took me an hour), we bought tickets, some food and drinks, and sat down. Two hours, forty five minutes, and three drinks later I walked out of the theater in astonishment. What I had seen was a combination of everything that made the very few good stephen king movies SHINE. It was like taking John Carpenter's "The Thing", mixing it with "The Shining" and "It", throwing in some incredible special effects, plot twists, and eye tearing suspense, then shaking it all up and throwing it into the projector reel. I do admit, it was long, but does it matter? Part of the problem today is people go to movies to see a constant stream of action, gore, and stuff blowing up. If you want that, you should go play some video games, because this isn't a movie for you. As for me? I will be waiting at Best Buy for this movie to come out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>now before you stephen king zionists eat me alive, my definition of a good movie is "something that keeps me entertained," which is, as some of us may have forgotten, the ultimate goal of any motion picture. this movie did just that. now a notch up on the mike-o-riffic scale is a GREAT movie, which is something that not only entertains me, but also keeps me thinking after the credits roll.this movie was a great movie i hear you... OH BUT IT WASN'T TRUE TO THE BOOK. the most overused phrase in the coffee shop movie reviewing industry is "yeah that was good, but the book was better" its true. ITS ALWAYS TRUE. STOP SAYING IT.enough of that. lets talk about this great movie. the plot sets up nicely, and eventually we find ourselves with the crippled teacher guy taking in the fat lost hiker man into the shelter. blah blahb lah omg u stink blah blah blah then eventually an alien pops out of the fat lost hiker guys pooper and we have ourselves a cute anal alien worm thing that likes to eat faces. (OH AND MOST ANNOYING SCENE EVER. when the toothpick guy is going for the toothpicks and he's like OMG MUST HAVE TOOTHPICK while sitting on the alien in the toilet. JESUS CHRIST. SCREW THE TOOTHPICK. DFAFAJADH)and EVENTUALLY we get to morgan freeman, who has been an alien ass kicker for over 25 years. then he says some stuff, and does some things, and ends up blowing away some guy in a helicopter and then crashing in one blaze of epic explosive glory.best scene ever was when the retard ends up being an alien (as nicely foreshadowed by one of the characters) and morphs and DESTROYS the big super mama anal alien mr gray in one weird gooey....delight. then they step on the little baby anal alien and the movie ends.again, i can hear your words through my monitor I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE I THOUGHT BY YOUR STANDARDS THAT A GREAT MOVIE HAD TO KEEP YOU THINKING BEYOND THE MOVIE.

I have a hint for you people...read one word after another. You know what,if you have to, GO BACK AND READ IT AGAIN...the pages don't just disappear. As for the movie, it wasn't that difficult to figure out what was going on. I don't know how you could get confused by any of it...Maybe what you need is someone to hold your hand to get you through it, tell you what is happening. You people always have to have movies laid out for you like See Spot Run...See Spot Run, He Runs Fast, Run Spot Run...Fact of the matter is, Dreamcatcher was damaged pre-production, with the script. The Actors did a helluva job, effects crew did well, the scenery was awsome. By no stretch of the imagination was this the worst movie ever (house of 1000 corpses gets that nod,at least for right now). Not even the worst Stephen King movie ever. I'm just tired of hearing the words sloppy and confusing. If you think you can do any better,why don't you get off your fat a$$ and write something that everyone can enjoy!!

		<fullReview>*** this may contain spoilers for the book - I don't think the movie could possibly be spoiled any more than it has been ***Kasdan will never work in this town again... ...or at least he shouldn't after making a left dogs dinner (which is worse than a right dogs dinner, or a left or right pigs ear) of converting the awesome Dreamcatcher novel from Stephen King onto the big screen.There are so many plot changes that it really doesn't resemble the book at all.We completely missed Kurts' obsessive chasing down of Underhill for crossing the "Kurts Line" - complete with Ripley-infested Archie Perlmutter acting as a radar - with Kasdan opting instead for an "it's all so easy, just me and my chopper and my electronic tracker unit, I'll have a cup of tea before I leave, plenty of time old chap" approach.What about Mr Gray trying to trick Jonesy out of his hidey-hole in his mind? Jonesy purposely introducing Mr Gray to bacon, the ensuing obsession with all things human, allowing Henry, Duddits and Underhill to catch up? What about the hospital scenes (aka The Real Ending)?It's turned what could have been a mind boggling thriller into a mundane 70's B-movie monster flick. The climax (and I use the term very loosely) between Mr Gray and Duddits - complete with Jason and the Argonauts style tacky monsters and jerky animation - takes the biscuit for the biggest let down of the entire movie, and there were plenty of scenes before all striving for that particular title.On the plus side (and I struggled to find one), the casting was almost spot on. Each of the cast members resembled the pictures I had in my head from reading the book numerous times, so I felt totally at ease with the group of four plus Duds, as well as the rest of the major cast members.Bottom line: Forget the movie and go buy the book instead. Let your mind do the story justice and forget this monster flop!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* SPOILERS AHEAD *This is one strange movie. I didn't read the Stephen King book and I was surprised to see he was listed as the author of the original work.The film has both elements of Alien and a movie I saw from the 1970s where giant maggots infest peoples apartments coming out the waste pipes - baths and entering certain orifices. Forget the name of the movie. In that respect, this is nothing new. The 1970s movie actually did it better. I was gratified to see the usual aliens (stereotyped in say Stargate SG-1 as being beneficial) get a makeover as the nasties. The alien worms were pretty good. This could end up being made into a TV series of the usual type - lone gunman versus the alien invaders. The only problem is that it's all been done before. Stephen King is usually referred to as a master of the horror genre. This was 2nd rate science fiction for sure.And as for the Lenoid Brezhnev eyebrows of Morgan Freeman, well, probably the most entertaining aspect to the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film makers claim that they tried to stay true to the novel as much as possible. If that's true, then King must really love juvenile, gross-out humor. This becomes evident when we meet the aliens. They infect people (and animals) with a red substance that makes them give off really, really bad smelling farts. (No, I'm serious.) Eventually a gigantic alien slug with eyes and teeth coming out the victim's ass, killing the host in the process.Watching this happen for the first time made me imagine someone giving the idea for Alien to MTV's famous moronic duo, and then Beavis going,"Hey, Butthead, wouldn't it be cool if, instead of the alien coming out of someone's chest, it came out their bung-hole? Heh, heh, heh."In short, it's hard to take the alien menace seriously, if for no reason other than that it seems to be trying to appeal to those whose idea of great comedy is fart and poop jokes. Maybe this story should have been called,"Killer Turds From Outer Space." (Heh, heh, heh.)</fullReview>

That make everything interesting.The movie is about some aliens that have been trying to take over the world for at least 20 years. Freeman is the boss of the alien killers. Four guys camp out in a cabin where the aliens "crash", they come in contact with the aliens. The aliens are able to take over the mind of people.The ending is nice, a disabled man turns out to be much much more than everybody thought. The alien is killed by him, and has been planned for very long.Freemans performance is crappy. The military scenes seem unbelievable compared to the rest of the story. How does the boss get a helicopter after being releaved of his command? Lots of unrealistic and stupid scenes there. But if you disregard that then its a good movie. It's hard to explain, this movie isn't for everyone, you need to be able to concentrate and be creative. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>noble failures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher, based on the novel by Stephen King, is a film that threatens to lose the viewer in its first 25 minutes. However, if one makes it past that deadly mark (and I almost did not) there is quite a passable thriller with much to entertain, and of its failures much to admire. Well, it is possible to admire its failures if you are a Stephen King fan anyway. If not then..more about that later.Dreamcatcher, directed by Lawrence Kasdan, is about four troubled friends who get together every year at a cabin in the northern woods of Maine. They grew up together in Derry, ME (King fans will recognize the town) and they share a troubling secret. Enough about that. Their yearly meeting takes a turn for the worst when they stumble upon a confused hunter in the woods. Soon our heroes find themselves quarantined, told to stay in their cabin (and wished the best of luck by the military in surviving the next 48 hours). Needless to say those 48 hours do not go smoothly. About the plot that is all I am going to say.Should you see this movie? I really don't know. If you are a King fan then I would say yes. If not then, I say you takes' yo' chances. Having said that there is so much that this film does right. The actors are all convincing. In fact I think Morgan Freeman and Jason Lee were born to be in Stephen King movies. They seem to me to have walked right out of a Stephen King novel. The director Kasdan also co-wrote the screenplay and he has succeeded admirably in capturing King dialogue. When the film finally finds its pace it becomes a truly taut and involving horror picture. The effects are good. And the film obeys a crucial rule of all good horror/sci-fi pictures: Anyone can die at anytime. That is, I think, crucial especially after we in the audience have grown to like the characters. We are always more involved in movies like this when we have doubts about who is, and who is not going to make it. And there are some scenes in the movie some gruesome, some not, that are perfect King. Those who read King and see the movie will know them. Those of you who do not read King, watch closely the bathroom scene, and just about any scene of dialogue involving Morgan Freeman. It is pure King.But I said this movie is flawed as well. And indeed it is. The first twenty-five minutes is far too disjointed. We meet our heroes but we have no context. We catch them in little moments, neat to be sure, but it all fails to grab you. `Why are we seeing this?' I asked. It is almost stream of consciousness filmmaking, and it almost takes you out of the film. I am sure it worked in the book. In a book an author has the luxury of time to establish a bit of mystery. Kasdan takes a bit too long to connect the early introductions to our heroes. There is other material that Kasdan chose to bring to the screen that I will not describe. See the film for yourself and decide if it works or not. I simply admire him for trying to do it. In King books there are often characters or places that really compel. The mind fills in the details, in essence the reader makes the material work. Sometimes in King's world there are cynical talking typewriters (Misery), slight of hand tricks that become white magic (Needful Things), and giant cosmic turtles that barfed up our universe (It). These things are compelling in prose. But they may not work so well on the big screen. Kasdan tries to bring everything King to the screen, and sometimes he fails, but these are noble failures.Stephen King films exist on a continuum. On the one end there is the crap, Maximum Overdrive, Sleepwalkers. On the other end there is the great, Stand by Me, Shawshank Redemption, Misery. Dreamcatcher sits somewhere, uneasily, in between. On my 10 point scale, this gets a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>?Dreamcatcher' is the latest cinematic adaptation of a Stephen King novel about four childhood friends with paranormal powers who go on a hunting trip together. Two of the main characters rescue a stranger wandering lost in the woods following a blizzard. It is clear that the stranger is unwell: his stomach is disturbingly swollen and he has a sinister looking rash on his cheek. The two friends suggest that he have a lie down in one of the bedrooms. Already, his stomach seems to be getting more enlarged; not only does the rash become deeper in colouration but it also appears to be spreading across a greater area of the stranger's face ?one can't help but feel a sense of dread as the friends sit in the next room! This film starts off well. The cabin in the middle of the snowy forest makes for a spooky setting and a sense of anticipation is created before the cause of the mysterious infection that is spreading round the local population is revealed. While the lead actors give engaging performances, Morgan Freeman is in a dubious choice of role here as a bad colonel guy with ridiculously huge eyebrows.The overall impression I have of this movie is that it can't quite make up its mind on what it wants to be ?I would describe it as a messy combination of horror/ psychological drama/alien movie. I therefore am uncertain as to what the target audience for this film is ?as a horror it is not really that scary but does have some gross out moments. The alien idea is also an unoriginal one and has been used more effectively in the Alien films and ?Signs'. Unfortunately, the end result is a very daft story and an overlong film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit that it's not the greatest film ever made and I was disappointed as I went purposely to get scared and it just wasn't scary. But at the end of the day, not every film has to be perfect and plausible and even though it wasn't scary it did make me laugh (esp. the jonesy/mr grey dialogue). I'd definately watch it again...7 out of 10. Probably not one for the die-hard Stephen King fans...I think they'd enjoy the book more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this film with some trepidations. I was half and half expecting a film like Signs, in which there is a lot of talk about aliens, but when you finally see them they suck.I haven't had the chance to read the book, so I cannot comment on how the plot follows the original story, but plot there is. Actually there are a multitude of sub-plots within the primary plot. This makes the film hard to follow at times.The special effects are not bad, at all, and although, as in every movie, the characters sometimes make extremely stupid decisions in the end the final goal is accomplished, accompanied by some of the weirdest special effects I've seen this year.The film does leave some questions unanswered, which may be answered by reading the book I guess. You simply cannot portray all the thoughts of all the characters in a film, although this film does try to do that, and admirably so.All in all a good, long film to see on a dreary, stormy night in a cabin somewhere in the woods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This novel could never work as a film. POSSIBLE SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it hard to understand why, of all the great horror novels King has written, that this one should be chosen for a film adaptation. The plot is so off-the-wall it really relies on the imagination of the reader to make it work as a novel, as a film it fails miserably and if the viewer hasn't read the novel they won't stand much chance of understanding the plot. The first half hour is fairly good, with plenty of dark humour, but from there onwards it goes seriously downhill and I couldn't wait for it to end. The 'Jonesy/Mr Grey' character was ludicrously unbelievable and the whole battle between the real Jonesy and Mr Grey which forms an integral part of the novel was glossed over and portrayed in a way that made it really difficult to follow. Dreamcatcher was not one of King's masterpieces and should have been left on the shelf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>VITAL INFORMATION IS REVEALED IN FOLLOWING TEXT AND MAY THEREFORE NOT BE APPROPRIATE TO READ FOR PEOPLE CONSIDERING WATCHING THE ACTUAL MOVIESay whatever you like but Stephen King is a great author, he may have a low worst-level but he can indeed write masterpieces. Unfortunately, I haven't read "Dreamcatcher" (yet) but I'm sure that the movie is on completely wrong path.This is a typical spooky - alien - horror movie filled with weird happenings, events that don't get explained until the very end of the film. (for example; "The Others" / Who is a ghost and who is not? , "Final Fantasy" / Is this really an invasion? ) It's these question who often make the movie worth watching, but in "Dreamcatcher" however, breathtaking answers is given almost at once, leaving the audience constantly updated about what's happening. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is not a very good idea. It's like removing kicks from a Bruce Lee movie, The Grim Reaper from "The Seventh Seal" and the Force from "Star Wars".A second thing that turns out very wrong is the fact that the monsters / aliens is shown almost immediately after approach. Learn from "Alien".Besides this "Dreamcatcher" has a very poor dialogue. Even though the cast is quite good indeed, the visual effects not bad either and some smashing mind frightening scenes "Dreamcatcher" doesn't gain much praise from me.I Duddits is therefore I-doubt-this(I think I've figured out the meaning of SSDD = Scooby Scooby Dooby Doo (or something like that))</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher is one of those movies that, when asked right after leaving the cinema, I couldn't answer if I liked it or not.At first I should note that I felt somewhat disappointed after every stephen king adaptations. Dreamcatcher had all the necesary ingredients to make it a block buster, yet still for one reason or another I haven't met anyone who really liked the movie beyond doubt. On the positive side there's a great visual language, well realised CGI and SFX work, and a good performance by at least some of the principal characters. But obviously that wasn't enough: both Morgan Freeman's and Tom Sizemore's characters lacked depth, or personality, or whatever one wants to call it. The plot (if one can call it that) runs on too many levels and is confusing rather than catching. Maybe the makers of this movie should have done it like Peter Jackson with Lord of the Rings, by choosing and focusing on one story-line (Frodo) and leaving out everything that's not crucially necessary.I didn't consider this movie a waste of ticket-money, as it is beatiful to watch and entertaining to a certain degree, but it sure won't make it on my favourite list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worldwidely, Stephen King's novels have always provoked the highest interest around them, not only because of it's cleverness and the ability to be turned into movies, but also because he can turn susceptible subjects into scary stories. This year's Dreamcatcher promissed to be something entirely different; so far, the movie wins the award for the worst trailer of the year; by the first time I saw it, I was totally unaware of this Stephen King's novel, and the trailer didn't actually help: a nonsensed overspeach and a totally unatractive collectiveness of images. To begin with, the whole audience was prepared to be thrilled by the welcoming short subject Animatriix. Then, we begun to watch the cinematic adaptation of the story. The beginning credits were very "arousing": the whole cast (probabily this years best after X MEN 2), and the technical crew, which did all the work that Lawrence Kasdan should have done and didn't, by his total indicisiveness of what kind of movie he wanted. The horror story that we begin to hear of, stars very well and ends very bad. There were some scary and tension moments that almost reached the sublime, and others that were unvoluntarely funny, also what is beyond me, is how some of the characters are constantly attacked and injuried and barely react as they would to a slapped in the face. But not everything is bad. The cinematography, sound manipulation, the performances and most of all the special effects and James Newton Howard's soundtrack are flawless. Bottom line: in a way Dreamcatcher is one of the years most deceptive works, unvoluntarely funny, and scary at parts alltogether. But it happens every year; you blame it, you burn it, you point the finger at it, but you can't avoid watching it with some silly smile and enjoyment on your face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many, I had a lot of anticipation for Dreamcatcher, I was, on the whole, quite disappointed.The films premise and concept, I thought was very good and emotive but the reality did not make for a good movie. A confusing narrative and poor structure took the impact from the meaning of Dreamcatcher. I find it hard to tell why the director Lawrence Kasdan (Wyatt Earp, 1994. Empire Strikes Back, 1983 - Screenplay.) chose to portray the story the way he has.Do not get me completely wrong, the film is by no means terrible and there are some truly edge-of-your-seat moments. Also some great set pieces and nice cinematography make for good viewing, it is also interesting to see Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore co-starring and Jason Lee providing brilliant comic effect.The Stephen King book is reportedly great and I can see how this is a good example of how an adaptation has failed to transcend well to a feature film.</fullReview>

Yes, I have read the book and I do understand what happens in the movie, but I did watch before reading. Morgan Freeman acted in the role of Kurtz superbly and Damien Lewis (as Jonesy) made the movie highly entertaining. For those who can hold their food, this would be a great movie to watch. Some parts are pretty disgusting, but they are for good reason and if watchers read the book, they would understand why completely. Stephen King is an excellent author who made a truly thought-out book, which was adapted to a screen-play wonderfully, but not quite totally explained. I would recommend this movie to anybody who can watch, think and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mish mash and overdose of Stephen King themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(contains spoilers) Stephen King died secretly several years ago and was brought back to life by the ravenous zombies that go to showings of his movie adaptations, always hungry for more. Dreamcatcher (which bears little relation to its own title and absolutely no relation to the Matrix-esque short that screens with it) uses a large number of King stock-in-trade storylines and keeps them alive long after any live audience might be expected to show interest. It starts off (stop reading here if you don't want to know too much) as a weird mind-reading thing, progresses to a bump-in-the night thing, to a mystery-illness thing, to a bug-eyed monster thing, to a full US-military against the alien invaders thing. The first to or three stories would have made it a successfully mediocre horror movie - the refusal-to-stop made it rather unbearable. Shamelessly derivative of a dozen better films (the plague that people succumb to is called the "Ripley" on account of its similarity to The Alien), Dreamcatcher is the worst horror film I've seen for a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Identity" vs. "Dreamcatcher"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from a bargain-priced second-run showing of the poorly-reviewed "Dreamcatcher," after paying 10 dollars earlier in the week to see the first-run, very-favorably reviewed "Identity." I have to say that, as usual, the critics were WRONG! "Identity" is being over-praised. Without giving anything away, it has one big plot twist towards the end that is of interest, but the hour and a quarter that precedes it is completely standard slasher-flick material--uninspired, derivative, and NOT SCARY. I always hate it when the filmmakers are so desperate in a horror film, that the only way they can scare you is by turning up the sound and producing loud noises. The rainstorm and the sound-effects are pretty much the first two-thirds of the film. And what are A-list actors like John Cusack and Ray Liotta doing in wasted roles like this?On the other-hand, I wasn't expecting anything from "Dreamcatcher." Much to my surprise, it is the superior of the two horror films, by far. It is far scarier, far more unpredictable, better photographed, with an intriguing story that never lets up and never stops surprising you. I have not read the book, so cannot comment on how well it was adapted, but at over 600 pages, it probably would have worked better as a 4-hour cable-miniseries. So a certain amount of condensation and confusion in the story in a film adaptation of 2 1/4 hours is to be expected. But it never dragged--"Identity" at less than 90 minutes actually FEELS a lot longer! Who among those who saw "Dreamcatcher" was not on the edge of his or her seat during the bathroom scene! The intensity level of that scene alone was worth the price of admission. I do not know why so many critics ragged on this film. Many complaining reviewers at this site are comparing it to the book, always an unfair comparison. A book is not a movie! Forget what the critics have said. If you are a fan of horror films, see this movie in a movie theater, where it is meant to be seen. Don't wait for it to come out in video. The small screen will dull the effect.</fullReview>

The acting from the four main characters is okay(Especially Damian Lewis, even though his British accent is pretty thick!) But what the hell Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore are doing in this movie is beyond me! The kind of suck!

There's a certain feeling you get from reading a book and no matter how cool or how creepy the book is, you just can't make a film good enough to capture the essence of the story. Especially if it's a Stephen King book. His books are extremely difficult to translate into a motion picture and with only a few exceptions, most of those movies are just not worth watching. The four main characters were interesting though and well-acted. Donnie Wahlberg was great, but Morgan Freeman was totally, totally wasted. Stephen King's books are great, but that's about it.

		<fullReview>I love every King novel (except "Insomnia`, which was so unbelievably boring that I still think it was written by someone else) and I hate nearly every movie or TV adaption of his books. Exceptions are "Carrie`, "Cujo` (despite the bad ending), Stand by me, Misery, Dolores Claiborne and most of all David Cronenberg´s Dead Zone. First of all, I really liked "Dreamcatcher`. It wasn´t a great movie, but I had lots of fun while watching what was going on. This is a big and expensive B-picture which crosses various genres. I think that´s the reason why it´s such a big flop. There´s simply too much of everything for a lot of people. The script was very faithful to the novel, so most of what I liked in the novel was also in the film. Some things came too short, but being condensed out of a book with more than 800 pages, something had to go. The scenes in Jonesy`s mind library were absolutely great. The acting ranged from ok (Freeman and Sizemore) to good (Lewis and Olyphant) to great (Jason Lee). John Seale´s camera was fantastic. Editing and music were good, as were most of the FX. What I really disliked was the ending, turning Duddits into an alien (using the worst CGI-FX I´ve seen in a long time) was a really dumb idea. While the execution of the scenes in Jonesy´s mind was so wonderfully realized, I don´t understand, why they didn´t used the books conclusion for the movie. But tampering with a books ending seems to be a hobby for Hollywood screenwriters. All in all this is one of the best King adaptations. It has it´s flaws, but it´s very entertaining, scary, bloody and funny and deserves much more success at the box office.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher is a quality translation of Stephen King's book, but it doesn't do the book justice. The first half of the movie I found absorbing and generally faithful to the book. However, it looks as if the editor went beserk in the second half and left most of the second half of the story on the cutting-room floor. As a shock horror movie, it worked well, but it left many questions unresolved. A major weakness was the movie interpretation of Duddits, who in the book was a retarded boy with a loving family, four special friends and a psychic gift. Converting him into an alien was pointless and unbelievable. Who thought up that clanger? The movie also failed to capture two other important character developments that the book did so well. First, Roberta Cavell was a devoted mother with a prominent role in the book, whereas her movie appearance was almost inconsequential. Second, the interplay between Owen Underhill and Col Curtis was believably portrayed in the book but the deterioration in their relationship was barely explained to any effect in the movie. As a straight horror movie, Dreamcatcher worked very well if you didn't try and analyse it, but if you want to understand the story and the characters, read the book first.</fullReview>

The made-for-TV movie (starring John Ritter, among others) is not too bad, although like in most cases, it is almost impossible for a movie to do full justice to a good book.I have been attracted to Dreamcatcher because I understand that it is similar to It, in telling the story of a group of kids getting together again as adults years after the adventure they had been through. Dreamcatcher, unfortunately, is not It......actually far from it (apologies for an unintentional pun). The story lacks the details, the sensitive touch and the depth of It. The characters are much less interesting.The movie is not a total lost, being quite entertaining. It is however far too long. Morgan Freeman is another reason that I went, but he had hardly any acting to do; a complete waste. The conflict so artificially built into his part of the story can be cut out entirely without affecting the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recall reading a review somewhere that described this film as being several different films edited together. I agree. King's story not only draws from some of his other outings but other's works as well - friends gather to beat the bad guy (It), isolation in the snow (The Shining), mammals as hosts for offspring (Alien) &amp; etc. Still I did enjoy the flick, tho 6/10 stars is as far as I would go. I think the casting was a little off, Tom Sizemore looked like he was about to explode for lack of lines, a mistake with such a strong actor. Morgan Freeman is far too old to be playing a Colonel in the military, particularly one in special forces - and those eyebrows were cheesy. Another great actor in the wrong role. The four 'heroes' did a convincing job, tho I must say I grow weary of King jamming the personal habits of his characters down the viewer's throat. Beaver and his toothpick fetish - not to mention the peanut butter scene - were just lame. Using the toothpick as the catalyst that gets him killed was beyond lame. The uses of made up curses, which he does in every book, has really reached the point of being a childish gimmick. The aliens and Mr.Gray were, however, appropriately sinister. For all the nonsense I did enjoy the scarey parts and pray that a sequal will be written by someone else if they make one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> Scary scenes got so intense I wished the characters would just keep talking like a typical Lawrence Kasdan film. I was laughing with the film in places that others were just laughing at it. In solemnly proclaiming the original owner of a gun which is passed from Morgan Freeman to his right hand man, the three great writers Kasdan, King and Goldman surely must have been offering a note of campy humor. I raved about this movie right after seeing it, possibly because it is so seldom I feel terrified by a movie and I was delighted to see Kasdan with a big budget. But because, apart from the directing, the movie has not impressed mass audiences, I have to concede that it might have been better with a smaller scope. Elements that people missed from the novel might have been one more distraction for general audiences. Maybe the movie might have been better with a hack at the helm so the characters would not be mourned as they kick off. Maybe the whole thing should have taken place in Jonesy's head as he battles for control with an alien who has possessed his body. To nit-pick, besides Lawrence Kasdan directing, what this movie has in common with Wyatt Earp and Silverado is an absent point of view - unless it is that of the storytellers. For me, this makes for textured layers in the storytelling and the movie does not stray too far at any one time from what we care about. But I think even the theme of trust and identity which ends the film would have been a more impact if the movie had used the possessed character as its lead through all scenes or stayed out of his head altogether more like the Thing. This would violate the tapestry of Stephen King's book, but it might have been easier for some people to digest. I am surprised how much Ebert and Roeper hated it. It may have been that good characterization can make a simple scare too ugly, and a classy treatment of an alien monster movie might not have been the best spin after all. But I still say it deserves higher numeric ratings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher, like so many other movies that have been adapted from best-selling novels by well-known authors, fails simply because it tried to bite off more than it could chew. Its just is not possible to adequately relate a story of 700+ pages from a novel in a 2 hour movie. And because of this, you get many parts of the story introduced into the movie, but never adequately used, explained, or concluded. In this case, virtually every character was underdeveloped, from Col. Curtis (Morgan Freeman) who seems thoroughly extraneous, particularly towards the end, to Jonesy (Damian Lewis) and his struggle within his own mind, which was cut to pieces from its form in the novel and thus left rather insignificant. And at the same time, the other three members of the main group were all just one-dimensional. They're just a bunch of regular guys that we hardly know anything about.Dreamcatcher from what I've read seems like the worst Stephen King story to have been made into a movie. Even in the novel, it was convoluted and difficult to follow. But at least with that, you got a chance to get to know the people involved. For all of its big-budget bravado and horror movie cliche scenes, when this movie is over, it seems as if no particular character or relationship stands out as memorable. It had to fly through so many scenes to explain enough of the complex story to get us by, that it made the characters act and realize things too quickly to be believable.All in all, it would seem that a movie like this one pays a heavy price to have a big name like Stephen King in the credits. It actually has to remain somewhat faithful to a story it doesn't have time to really follow through on. I mean, if you have to edit down and change a best-selling author's work this much to put it on the screen, then why bother to adapt their work at all?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**mild spoilers** i think it's safe to say that on a large scale the modern movie industry is going down the toilet(no pun intended.) perhaps writers have become confused about what is good material...the worst movies now boom at the box office thanks to clever marketing. the trailers for "dreamcatcher" were misleading, as they promised more suspense and fright than was generated. also, i didn't read the book, but there is overwhelming evidence that this is not a complete adaptation of king's book. all that aside, dreamcatcher is a decent film. the atmosphere is heavy, dark, and helps hold interest. many people have claimed "dreamcatcher" to be filled with childish humor and plot holes. i found it's shortcomings to be of normal proportion. if one could enter the theater without preconceived notions(which is hard, granted the multitude of poor reviews,)this film is chilling and at times, intellectual. acting and effects were very well executed. much of the plot is psychological, and flashbacks are necessary for comprehension, which i think may be one of the reasons why some naive individuals walked out. this is not one of the greatest film-going experiences of 2003, but i believe it's worth the ticket price and 136 minutes of your time(especially if you're into alien conspiracies.) the miniature matrix feature was an added bonus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers...Saw the film. Read the comments, but not the novel. My take: As with any mystery, I try to figure out where a story is going before it gets there. I can pat myself on the back for "getting it right," or be impressed that the producers misdirected me, and I generally enjoy the ride. "Dreamcatcher" definitely did not end up going in the direction it hinted at, but the interesting aspect of this is that the story that I imagined it would be is FAR more interesting and logical than what appeared to me on the Big Screen. Ohmygod - what a silly, illogical movie!!! Here's where I thought it was going, and you all tell me if you don't think it would have been a far superior story (Mr. King?):The Dreamcatcher catches all the bad dreams, right? As the movie is unfolding in the ridiculous second half and all scenes look so derivative (Aliens, Men In Black, etc.), I assumed that what was presumably happening was that the Dreamcatcher was kicking back twenty years of bad dreams, scary thoughts, disturbing images, etc. that the four men had put there over their annual treks to the cabin. Therefore it would explain the disjointed aspect of all the "plotlines" and would incorporate the cool storage facility image that was ultimately only in Damian Lewis' brain. For the longest time in the movie, I truly thought this would end up being the explanation for all of this. Why the "Dreamcatcher" was doing this I haven't fleshed out, but keeping all the nuttiness on the level of "brain waves becoming reality" seems far more realistic to me in a true horror sense than what the story actually was, which is just plain silly. Stephen King - you hinted at a really strong story, got me drooling over where the movie might go, where you might take us within the brain, and you completely let us down...unless you were indeed making a satire. Sigh...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS!!! When I read Stephen King's Dreamcatcher last summer I loved it. Perfect holiday filler. As I was lying in the sun, getting a tan, I enjoyed being transported to that snowy landscape with aliens running amok and sh*t-weasels burstin' out o' asses. Hell, I adored the novel. Sure, it was a mixture of all things King had written in the past but that didn't matter. It was a fine read and one I proudly keep on my bookshelf. Needless to say, I had great anticipation for the movie, but then, with Larry Kasdan at the helm and William Goldman writing the screenplay nothing could go wrong. Right?! That was, until the armada of bad reviews rolled in. And not just the critics called it an inconsistent mess, even fans of the book declared this to be a cinematic turd of epic Battlefield Earth-ish proportions. And to think this was my underdog hype of the year. A little Hollywood gem, I hoped, surviving amidst Hulks, X-Men and Matrices.Dreamcatcher is about four friends on their annual hunting trip in the woods of Maine. There, they reside in a cabin called Hole In The Wall, where they have a few drinks and some nostalgic fun. In a way these guys are all losers but they have a common gift, some sort of ESP, that binds them in a telekinetic `I know what you're thinking' kinda way. One day, Jonesy (Damian Lewis) finds a man lost in the woods. He's burping and farting and before you can say `sh*t hits the fan' all hell breaks loose and the `gassy fellow' finds himself sitting on the toilet with something exploding out of his butt. Jonesy and his foul-mouthed pal Beaver (Jason Lee) make the morbid discovery with the creature or whatever it is still inside the toilet bowl. Next is a gory spectacle that's all over the place involving giant gray aliens, eels with razor-sharp teeth, helicopters destroying hundreds of ET's, Morgan Freeman's bushy eyebrows, a `mentally challenged' boy, flashbacks straight out of Stand By Me (or IT), car-crashes, Gollumesque schizophrenic discussions and surreal mind-games.When I heard Jason Lee, Timothy Olyphant, Damian Lewis and Thomas Jane were gonna play the four friends I thought they were miscast but to my surprise their performances are adequate. Lee spurts out King written one-liners in pure Kevin Smith fashion and Lewis steals the show in his dual role as Jonesy and Mr. Gray. The alien's British accent people complained about actually works better than I imagined. Olyphant plays Pete, an alcoholic who uses his gift to, hopefully, gets laid but he's very unsuccessful. Pete's my favorite character in the book but he gets cut short here (especially the way he dies is a disappointment) but Olyphant makes the most of his limited screen-time. Thomas Jane is not my favorite actor but his performance, playing a suicidal psychiatrist, works. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of General Curtis is not bad but I would have preferred the crazy loon from the book. Here he's just under some pre-retirement stress. Tom Sizemore, an actor I adore, is wasted as Owen Underhill. It's another military role for him and he's not really stretching his acting muscles.30 minutes in and I was loving it. Kasdan established the characters as in the book and he slammed the surreal Memory Warehouse down our throats; a delightful concept many directors would have thrown out. For that alone, I salute Kasdan and Goldman and they use this bizarre subplot (involving Jonesy trapped inside his brain with the monstrous Mr. Gray trying to take over) to good effect (the scene where Jonesy goes out to get some memories with the monster chasing him could have been more intense but is pretty heart-pumping as it is). An hour later and I was still with it. The weasels (even more grotesque than what I imagined) work and the infamous toilet-scene is great, followed by the ultimate test for moviegoers: Jonesy's initial meeting with Mr. Gray. Straight from the pages and onto the screen, it's as twisted flicks can get and if you go with Dreamcatcher past this point, you have nothing to worry.Now for my grudges. I didn't like Jonesy's physical transformations, this should have been kept psychologically. More important is the ending which ruins the movie as a book adaptation. Duddits, the aforementioned Down syndrome guy, turns out to be an alien. It's a misplaced move that might have been suggested (among other things) in the book but never came to my mind while reading it. And then, during those final minutes, the movie turns into a monster-fight that seems to suggest an intergalactic war between alien races with Earth as their battleground. Hmm. okay.?! Another mayor fault is Curtis' helicopter frenzy. I know the `three car chase' from the book is difficult to put on film but it could have been fantastic. Too bad.But despite these problems (and they're big, mind you) Dreamcatcher succeeds. It's a brave attempt to capture the spirit of a pretty wild book in the first place and thanks to the actors portraying the friends, James Newton Howard's mysterious score and John Seale's at times breathtaking cinematography it works, making this foray into science fiction/horror the perfect example of a 'terrible film that really isn't'. In fact, this has got 'cult' written all over it. And another thing: with Hollywood pooping out teenage slasher flicks by the numbers and studio wannabe crap like Ghost Ship finding an audience, we horrorgeeks have to go out on a limb to find good genre-films. They're either low-budget, independent low-brow gore flicks playing at festivals or Oriental curiosities (The Ring, The Eye). When a mayor studio releases a picture like this with at least something on its mind, we have no right to throw it out with the trash.Granted, Dreamcatcher is at times a lousy adaptation. But as a movie it's entertaining big-budget cult. And I for one like it for that reason.K.D.M.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually enjoyed it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that I'm in a minority here but I actually enjoyed this movie. I knew going into it that I wasn't going into a masterpiece but when going to a film made out of a Stephen King novel it's advisable to have that mind set. There are a few exceptions to the rule, Stand By Me, The Shawshank Redemption, Misery, and (although I found it rather boring) The Shining, but generally Stephen King movies are terrible. This one, although the people who made it should have done better, is still better than the majority of them.If you take the director and writer Lawrence Kasdan and compare it to his other work it just doesn't reach the levels but I felt that there were several moments he handled very well. Of course he's on more familiar turf but the scenes between the four friends were very good, although they did appear to be part of a different movie to the rest of it. *SPOILER, BIG ASS SPOILER* Once Jason Lee and Timothy Olyphant were dead the film did degenerate into a bit of a mess, but it was still a fun mess. *END SPOILER* There were great birds eye shots of the snow covered forest. The acting was ok, some of the cast were better than others. Lee and Olyphant were good in the more comical roles, Damian Lewis once again showed his pitch perfect American accent (he's English) and did very well in a role that could have ended up looking completely comical if not handled right. And Morgan Freeman was over acting but that didn't matter as I couldn't take my eyes off of his huge eye brows, so the acting wasn't noticed all that much.OK, most of the plot is improbable but it's a sci-fi thriller, of course it's improbable. If you don't go in wanting to see a work of art you wont be disappointed. It's a fun film that while not one of the great King adaptations, is definitely one of the better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT: This review uncharacteristically contains spoilers because I feel a civic duty to warn you away from this film. THE REVIEW: I couldn't wait to see this movie. Director Lawrence Kasdan has a habit of making films that I really like, and so does screenwriter William Goldman. Put them together with a Stephen King premise and you can't miss, right? Wrong. Way wrong. This movie is horrible. I'm still struggling to understand the connection between the Dreamcatcher and anything else about this film. There were like, I dunno, five movie premises in this film, all strung together, totally unrelated, and ultimately worthless in their conglomeration. A creepy group of dreamcatchers backed by an Indian legend? Cool. Guys in the woods with a past and a mysterious connection to a mysterious little boy? Well, okay, I suppose that works too. Spooked animals with some kind of strange disease? Cool, but umm.... Dead and dying people wandering aimlessly through the forest. Uhhh...... Weird premonitions? Ummm.... A shapeshifting alien who speaks through an inhabited body with a natty English accent? Now wait a minute..... An epic military battle between human and alien that has been going on for decades under our noses? Hey, what the...? A three dimensional characterization of a man's memories as a group of rooms in a basement? Whoa, Nelly! A second, hidden alien presence that teams up with. . . . Now just a darn minute! A climactic finale involving a brave guy who inexplicably freezes while trying to save the world? Stop. Stop!!!! STOPPP!!! I think William Goldman himself said it best in his book Adventures in the Screen Trade: "nobody knows anything." Obviously, Goldman didn't know enough to stay away from this stinker. You know better. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the big deal about this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me say that I watch tons of movies and I am generally very picky about them, more so than even most critics. However, I enjoyed this film when most people seem to hate it with a passion. I have to echo the statements of some of the other reviewers by saying that you will not like this movie if you don't like Stephen King. Now, I haven't read the book this was based on, but I have read several King novels and this movie seemed to reflect his style like few of his other movies have. The dialogue must have been taken verbatim from the book, because it has Stephen King written all over it. I think the reason this movie wasn't well received was that most people just wouldn't like King's weird fantasy/sci-fi stories. Not all of his books are straight horror/thriller like the Shining &amp; Cujo or drama like Green Mile/The Body (Stand By Me). I find I enjoy King's stranger novels, but you have to forgive the fact that they are extremely campy. Anyone that reads best seller novels knows that a certain level of camp and melodrama appears that movies avoid. This time, the movie's creators decided to go all-out with the campy dialogue and bizarre imagery. To everyone who complained that the book was better than the movie, sure they changed stuff, but this can't be a worse translation than Peter Jackson's versions of the Lord of the Rings books, which I have heard many people complain about. They had barely over 2 hours to do a very long novel, you just can't expect everything from the novel to end up in the movie! In closing, I will admit that maybe this is a movie that only Stephen King fans will like (including those who don't know they are fans yet), but it really carried King's trademarks like no other movie I've seen based on his work.</fullReview>

Anyway, this movie doesn't quite deserve to be associated with King. The story of the movie comes off like real horror schlock, having psychics battling alien monsters. The visual effects were much better than the script. The movie was a creepy sight, but an eye-opener, nonetheless. If there was one clever facet of the movie, it was the scenes in Jonesy's "memory warehouse."

The flashbacks of the four (five including "Idunnit") main characters is a tactful homage to Reiner's "Stand By Me," just as the red moss that grows around the infested areas recalls the green moss growing in the overall-clad hick (performed by King) segment in "Creepshow." The cold and desolate wintry shots call to mind Misery and The Shining as well. Anyone interested in early Cronenberg films, the Alien Saga or Carpenter's version of "The Thing" will enjoy this "Body Snatcher" tale that picks up where Shamalayin's understated "Signs" left some cold.

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this book. Certainly the best King's written since "IT". The movie.....Oh the pain of seeing a King movie. I keep hoping that something will top "The Dead Zone", and I keep being disappointed.The other reviewers are correct. The first act of Dreamcatcher is really good. The cast works well together, 'though I pictured R.Lee Ermey in Morgan Freeman's part when I read the book. Now I understand to get all of King's nuances into a movie, it requires 4-6 hours, and I certainly didn't expect that. The first problem is that the story deviated way too far from the book. The chase in the book led up to a great ending, with Owen (Tom Sizemore's character) as the hero. It also gave a lot more insight into his character, as well as Morgan Freeman's.My second issue is the way the duel between Jonesey and Mr.Gray was portrayed. Damian Lewis (in my opinion) did an absolutely awful job, even before the "split" in his character. Why would an alien have an English accent? Hackneyed, hackneyed, hackneyed.The ending is just another godawful cop-out like the TV version of "IT". Jason Lee, Thomas Jane, and Tom Sizemore do a good job with what they've got to work with, but the final product is a typical King movie...Flashes of brilliance, but ultimately a let-down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good movie as horror movies go.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not read everything King has written, in fact I have not read the Dreamcatcher, but I have read most of his stuff. The reason I and so many other read his books is exactly why it is so hard to make a good movie from them. Because King is better than anyone at capturing the very essence of human.There are exceptions, notably the The green mile and Hearts in Atlantis, The body (stand by me) each followed the books well enough and managed to show Kings understanding of the psych and his absolute brilliance with making us relate with his characters. As mentioned I did not read this book but as I watched the movie I could tell it did not properly capture the book.To rate this movie requires that you properly apply the genre I (and no doubt many others) only saw it because it was from a King book. Thats is good and bad for movie makers. Good because it draws people to the theaters, bad because I think we have been spoiled by The green mile and Hearts. Even my wife wanted to see this and she is not a horror fan at all. So folks will judge this according to those films. It isn't even close.This is a horror flick much like many of the earlier King book movies (Christine,Cujo etc) and taken purely within the horror genre it is a pretty good offering. Certainly better than any of the haloweens, friday the thirteenths or nightmare movies. Better even I think than Carrie.Overall I liked a lot about the movie. First as a horror movie I liked it because unlike so much in the horror genre (and much else from hollywood) it did not ask that I completly suspend all reality. Sure there is farce here but nothing like a kid who spends umpteen movies only seeming to die.Taken out of the genre this movie falls a little shy though because the director forgot that he was making a horror movie and tried to make a 'green mile' movie.Overall this movie is entertaining but a little predictable. The effects (which are the most overrated aspect of movies) do not detract and the movie moves along nicely. However the director fails to capture the human element and that makes this movie at best ok.Give it a 4.8 out of ten</fullReview>

Regardless of the reason, this movie is a bloody prolapsed mess. The only good things I can say about it are 1) There was a Matrix animated short called "The Final Flight Of The Osiris" before the movie started that was incredible, and 2) The special effects in the film where pretty good, and 3) When the movie starts and the opening credit fly by, you may be tempted to think "Oh cool! Jason Lee! Morgan Freeman! Tom Sizemore! This is gonna be great!" but the movie was only mildly entertaining, mostly thanks to Jason Lee ("Beaver") right up until the point Beaver insists on reaching for his toothpicks when every non-fictional character in the world would have left them right where they were (about a fourth of the way in). After that, the film was just frustrating and non-sensical. The characters never reacted the way real people would react. The explanations of what was going on were contrived and implausible. (sigh) It was just SO BAD.So far this is the worst film I have seen in 2003 (but I have yet to see The Core). If you do pay to go see this in the theater, just watch the Matrix animated film at the beginning and then leave.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Come on. It's a crappy sci fi flick, the kind that helps you pass a rainy Sunday afternoon. If you expect greatness, you will be disappointed. It's a really, really dumb movie. The aliens are cool, though, there's good chemistry between the characters, and it's all goofy good fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to start off that I have not read the book, but it is on my to-do list. I would also like to add that I, and my father, enjoyed this film, and were talking about it on the way home. I would like to note that if you enjoy an edge of your seat thriller, then you will enjoy this film. I would also like to mention that Stephen King is a great author. Despite if you like this movie or not do not judge Stephen King on the greatness of this movie.Overall I would like to say that I enjoyed this movie despite reading the bad comments on this website. I would personally give this movie 9/10 stars. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mess of an invasion movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Stephen King story is brought to film by Lawrence Kasdan, who seems to be trying to take his "Big Chill" premise of old friends reuniting, and cross it with an alien invasion film and a slasher film... Morgan Freeman, in desperate need of a new agent, plays a government agent hunting aliens.. Thomas Jane and a cast of game up and commers play the old friends, all of whom were granted some unexplained psychic abilities by a strange child they saved as youths.. none of this is fleshed out, and their abilities dont seem to aid them when they are attacked by the aliens.. one of which comes out of it's hosts bodies in a rather gross fassion. This story makes no sense to those of us who didn't read King's book.. and it kinda falls apart as more aliens and space ships appear, the government conspiracy storyline is introduced and abandomed and then the now grown kid appears at the end with some resolution of sorts.. A mess of a story made into a mess of a movie. GRADE: D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw Dreamcatcher and can understand why those didn't read the book actually liked the movie. You don't know how ridiculous the last half of the movie is. I've read the book twice and thoroughly enjoyed it. The first half of the movie is pretty true to the book with a few added scenes that they should have left out and used the extra time in the second half to explain a few things and tie up loose ends. (SPOILER: The ending was so out in left-field it was pathetic. There was also not enough elaboration used on the relationships of these five men, especially Dudditz) end of SPOILER It's not like Hollywood isn't capable of turning a King novel into a good movie. Look at The Green Mile and Misery. And they were both pretty faithful to the books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realize that it is challenging, perhaps impossible, to do justice to a 900-page book in a two-hour film. But the excellent King novel has been diminished to the point of gross STUPIDITY. No excuse for that! (*SPOILER*) Duddits was an ALIEN??? Come on, now. It's like Kasdan really wanted to translate the initial cabin sequence to film. After he did that (and quite well, I might add), he totally lost interest in the project and added the rest of the story as a barely coherent afterthought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to have read an in-depth review of Dreamcatchers prior to viewing this film. Otherwise I may not have understood events of this movie as quickly. After the so-so animatrix 9 minutes, I was on the edge of my seat for the entire length of this film. It was fantastic. I went to see this movie because 1)I am a huge Tom Sizemore fan, 2) I thought Damien Lewis was brilliant in Band of Brothers so I was looking forward to more of his work and 3) I found the casting of Jason Lee with these accomplished actors (ie, those aforementioned and Morgan Freeman) interesting. I know that Mr Lee has a great career, however I was thrilled to see him not only hold his own, but shine next to Mr. Lewis and Mr. Sizemore. I really enjoyed this flick and recommend it to anyone in the mood for quality work and good suspense as to how this film could possibly end. My only criticism would be that Mr. Freeman and Mr. Sizemore did not have enough screen time for my taste. Although I understand you can only fit so much into one movie that has so many great performances of all well written characters. Please go see or at the very least rent the dvd when it is released.</fullReview>

A friend of mine had read the novel before hand, told me the movie would be so much better if I did not know the story line, so when a trailer or commercial came on, I left, or changed the channel. As ridiculous as it sounds, I am glad I did it.***Spoilers***I had no idea it was about "shit weasels" or about aliens. Or guys who could communicate using their minds. It's just a really great idea.***End of spoilers***I mean, this is the kind of film that happens because every element is great. You have the amazing director Lawrence Kasdan, the writer of the book, Steven King, and the cast, including Morgan Freeman, Time Sizemore, Jason Lee, Timothy Olyphant, and my favorite of the bunch Damian Lewis. Every part of this film is great. I highly recommend it.9/10, or ****` out of 5.</fullReview>

Dreamcatcher, host to at least four half-baked plot genres, takes about 20 minutes to start bloating and not much longer to manage the rest. I love alien pix, quirky psychological pix, medical emergency pix, military out-of-control pix and youthful bonding pix. But pixomething and stick with it! This is a sorry exercise in film making. Someone needs to go into Stephen King's cinematic memory warehouse and start planning a garage sale. Has anyone counted the automobile and truck accidents in his films? Could the vehicle that actually hit Stephen have really been his karma? Now THERE'S a film!</fullReview>

I mean, after I read the book (which was a week before I saw the movie) I told people, "If the movie follows the book, it will be awesome."....but of course it didn't, for the most part.The part of the movie that did go by the book was great...but after that ended....well read the book and see the movie.I guess Kasdan thought it would be less mind boggling to take out the most intricate and amazing part of the book...the telepathy.That's pretty much all I have to say except, WHY WAS KURTZ NAMED CURTIS?

		<shortDescription>It honestly wasn't THAT bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so the previews for this movie don't exactly allude to the plot. Obviously, being a Stephen King creation, it's going to be some type of sci-fi mind screw, but what the previews don't really show is the introduction of some very interesting-looking aliens. Wormy parasites with razor-sharp teeth that are hell-bent on flesh consumption? Beings that explode into a red powder so they can enter a human body via the eyes and nose? What a nice variation on the typical "greys" we normally see. Oh, and don't forget the crimson-colored moss. That was new. The performances from most of the actors weren't bad, either. I just really like Jason Lee, and his role of "Beaver" was very much him. And although I don't think I have ever really seen Damian Lewis before, his performance was one of the best. However, it wasn't topped by Donnie Wahlberg's portrayal of the "leukemia"-stricken, big-hearted, not-so-simple-minded "Duddetts." While Dreamcatcher had a very colorful and intriguing sci-fi edge to it, at the root it is a flick about the strength of friendship and the things we learn from others. Oh yeah, and aliens, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This picture is scary and so well crafted by director Kasdan. I was on the edge of my seat watching this. However, the film would have benefited from a simpler, less complex plot. What suffers here is character development. Morgan Freeman is one dimensional with less screen time than I expected. If more time could have been given to explain why an alien chose the body of a retarded child of all people and why he took such an inactive role in the invasion until late in the story. This seems illogical. Despite these glitches and the familiar alien nesting in a human's belly, I still recommend this film for Stephen King and sci-fi fans only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught 'Dreamcatcher' last night after reading all of the bad reviews. After watching, I don't think it is quite as bad as it is made out to be. There is no clear genre for this movie. It would seem that Stephen King took all of the familiar themes from all of his stories and rolled them into one story that cannot possibly be done right in a two-hour film span. This movie would have been MUCH more successful if they had axed the feature-film idea and made it a mini-series, or stretched the running time to 3 hours. But as it is, I would give this film a 6.5 based on originality alone. I have never seen quite so much genre mixing in one film. The story needed more time to develop. Case in point: the whole military aspect was never really fully developed, so when the two soldiers kill one another at the end it is sort of anticlimactic. It would also have been a better movie if they had taken more time to focus on the extraordinary characters. All we really know about them is that they got a gift from a 'mentally challenged' kid, and they are good friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreamcatcher, like real dreams, is a convoluted mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS (FOR YOUR OWN GOOD): I can't understand what happened here. This movie was written by William Goldman, and directed by Lawrence Kasdan, and yet it might be one of the worst catastrophe's I have ever witnessed. The movie never knew what it wanted to be! Is it a sci-fi action movie? Is it an alien invasion or monster movie? Is it a psycho thriller? Is it "Stand By Me", or is it a comedy about flatulence? This movie was well titled. Not because of the actual indian dream catcher artifact (which has about two minutes of screen time, and absolutely nothing to do with the entire movie) but because it plays out like a real human dream. Our dreams are convoluted- they run all over the place, and never make any sense. One minute we're sharing childhood memories with friends in a cabin, the next minute we have psychic powers, and after that we're fighting butt invading aliens!I am not a movie snob. I enjoy many different types of films. I also work in the industry, and I know what it takes to make a good story. You have to keep your audience interested! I lost interest the minute that pork tenderloin with teeth came out of the hunter's butt. The first half hour of the movie is all set-up, with no pay off! Why do these guys need psychic powers? Why did Duddits give them these powers? Why did Duddits (an alien inside the body of a Downs Syndrome child)wait so many years to reveal himself and save the world? What did he need these guys for? Their powers didn't do them much good! Two of them were easily dispatched early on. Why do the aliens need to grow inside a human host, when they can simply lay eggs? How has Morgan Freeman been fighting these creatures for 30 years, without anyone knowing about it? Why was this movie called Dreamcatcher??? My questions are quickly becoming as convoluted as this horrible movie was!I am writing this review as a warning. It costs $10 bucks to see a film in this town (LA), so you need to shop wisely. I have been a fan of Stephen King in the past, and was expecting a real thriller. What I got was a real mess. The acting is bad, and the writing is bad. Here's a perfect example: Jason Lee is sitting on a toilet. Something is inside the toilet, and wants to get out! His life may depend on keeping that lid shut! So what does he do? He does everything he can to reach a toothpick resting on the floor (covered in blood) in front of him! Why does he do this?? What does he need that toothpick for? Is it worth his own life? How could this waste of time have ever been made? Do yourself a favor and stay as far as you can from this disaster!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started seeing the trailers for this flick last year, and the trailers scared the beejeesus out of me. I looked forward to the movie with great anticipation, but was totally let down. How could they make a bad movie with Morgan Freeman?? I mean, they really had to try, I guess. The premise (alien invasion and government conspiracy, like the X Files) gets lost in a typical Stephen King backstory involving some dorky kids in Maine, of course. How many times can one author use the same story--I thought I was watching "It", another King movie; much better, I might add. The photography (in British Columbia, Canada) is stunning and the special effects are top-notch...but movie is really hard to sit through. The cast, including Morgan Freeman, does a great job and I'm sure they were all well-paid to appear in this.Skip it and see something else this weekend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've never read the book, you'll have to rely totally on the movie, which seems to do a pretty good job of sticking to the original story.Director Lawrence Kasdan keeps us in suspense until we can't wait a minute longer for Dreamcatchers to straighten us out and supply some answers. Questions like, who is this Duddits 4 childhood friends (Henry, Beaver, Pete, and Jonesy) keep referring to and what are these 4 friends who seem to have alien powers? Where did these powers come from and who is the real alien anyway?To make things even more mysterious, the military gets involved and brings in a veteran alien fighter named Colonel Abraham Kurtz, played by Morgan Freeman. The answers come while the 4 are on their annual hunting trip. This story, confusing as it is, comes together by the end and holds your attention while doing so. There's one big twist, regarding Duddits, that's left unsettled or maybe it was settled. You'll have to see it to determine that for yourself.Overall, Dreamcatchers was entertaining, suspenseful, and action packed. What more can you ask for in a movie? Since it's futuristic, just about anything goes, right? Give Lawrence Kasdan a hand for even attempting to direct such a difficult story in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm wondering what William Goldman was thinking when he wrote the screenplay for this film. As writer of "The Princess Bride" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" you would expect more -- a LOT more. I've never read the Stephen King book but I'm sure it was more than readable wheras this movie is less than watchable. The dialogue is ridiculous, the acting is horrific, and it seems as if they changed writers halfway through the film because the movie suddenly became an action flic rather than (what was supposed to be) a haunting psychological tale. Morgan Freeman, a great actor in most everything he's ever been in, is horrible here. It seemed like he's been studying at the Bruce-Willis-furrowed-brow-action-star school of acting. Apparently he's decided to just read cue cards instead of actually emoting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher has one of the most original plots I've seen in a movie. It was a bit mind-boggoling at first, But then i started to get into the flow. This is a first-rate Science Fiction Horror movie. The scenery is excellent, it is well acted, and the special effects were above-average, the story was original and real good. It wasn't exactely very scary, but it did have its moments. I was mostly engrossed in the storyline of the movie, and the Government conspiracy part was excellent. This movie has quite a bit of blood, with the horrors coming out of the most "rear" of places. How the movie begins is really confusing, but as the movie progresses all your questions get answered. Anyways, I despise all those who say this is a horrible movie, they just simply are taking drugs and do not know what they are talking about. This is a top-notch Sci-Fi Horror movie which is both long and engrossing. Go see it for a good thought-provoking scare. Supramaxx Rating- 8.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard quite a lot of bad news about this movie, but being a sci-fi fan, I found the movie quite enjoyable. *note: this movie is not for the Squeamish* When you see worms come from the southern regions and attack people then take their form, some parts were really funny. "Quote: you not Joansey!" And That duddin's kid, or whatever his name is, was pretty freaky. Half of the time you didn't understand what he was saying, but that's okay. Seeing Joansey in his own Memory was kinda cool, seeing what he saw in his mind, hiding in it from Mr. Grey. Very interesting story line, just what you'd expect from Stephen King, makes me want to read the book. I understood every little bit of the movie, and I would like to see it again. I wonder what it'll be like on DvD, when i was in the theater, you could really appreciate the sound effects, also, the movie had good music, even if it didn't have lyrics.My final statement, go see this movie if you like twists and sci-fi, but do not see it if you are looking for Academy award Material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found that the problem I have is once I read the book, there is so much to expect. So over the years, I have watched movies with a grain of salt. There are very few that add up to the book. Needless to say, this movie did not compare. Of course I thought the actors did a fine job at their characters though. The final solution to Duddits was way out of bounds. That one single thing sucked the life out of it for me. I do think people are being to harsh on the over all movie. Especially the ones that say how Mr. Grays/Jonesys English accent was off or unreal. Damien Lewis is English. Hard for a man to get his own accent wrong. For all that were disappointed, check out the book. Maybe it will make some since of what they tried to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***MILD SPOILERS*** I went and saw this movie with my wife, who has read every Stephen King book to date. She told me that the movie did stick to the book fairly well, but, of course, I'm looking at the film from my perspective; someone who hasn't read the book. I thought that the beginning where Jonesy got hit by the car had a big disappointing plot hole. As hard as he was hit, I assumed he was about to die...permanently. Then all of a sudden it's 6 months later, and all he has is a limp. No scars or other permanent physical damage that would ensue from being hit by a car going roughly 35-45MPH. I even mentioned that to my wife and she said that the book told about how he got better...kinda lame that the film totally left that out. As far as the $hi+ weasles, I thought they were a very original idea (of course, Stephen King is VERY creative) and the CGI was really cool and realistic. I could see how having one of those things inside your gut would cause your abdomen swell up, but I don't see how it would cause someone to continuously belch and fart. Perhaps if I had read the book before I would have a little more insight, but I think that any good movie that is based on a book should be done so that people who haven't read the book aren't left in the dark on a lot of things. (i.e. Pet Sematery had an easy-to-follow plot, and the Green Mile, while it required a little more thought, was still an excellent movie where you don't have to read the book in order to get the big picture) Then again, I guess this would be the big picture for this movie: An alien comes to Earth "disguised" as a handicapped kid, gives "powers" to 4 kids that help him out, 20 years later these other aliens attack, the grown men go to a cabin in the woods, get a bad taste of the aliens, Duddits is brought back, he morphs back into an alien and saves the world. I guess I could give it a 6 out of 10 also, and I do agree with most of what everyone else has said about the ending. My main critique on this movie would be to get rid of some of the holes in the plot, and make that "Beav" guy not be obsessed with freakin' toothpicks!! If he would have stayed his @$$ on the toilet, he wouldn't have gotten killed!! All because of an obsession with toothpicks!! ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well the movie is what the book was, not King best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adaptation of King books always suffer form translation to regular movie, they are more suited for mini serie, not always good (aka 'Storm ...' but sometimes real interesting 'The stand'). I classified this book in the same category than Storm of the Century (Not Kings best effort).Interesting premise (very exciting first 200 pages) but then the novel lose interest, not knowing where it goes. Best part of Dreamcatcher was the first part, more horror and suspense. The second part was mostly a pursuit divided in 3 cars. The movie chop most of the second more weak part (and when i say chopping it's major chop), the story stay the same in the big lines which is always interesting, yes the final is quite different from the book. The woods looks premade (and they are as i saw the mini movie on Dreamcatcher site.) Special Effect are average at best, Army intervention being the worst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1) I read the book. If you read the book and liked it in any way, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.2) I saw this on opening day, knowing how bad it was gonna be, so I kind of did it to myself. I took my girlfriend to see it. About half an hour into it, I was already mentally composing my apology. Yes, it is that bad.3) I was wrong about knowing how bad it was gonna be. It was even worse. And the special effects sucked!!! This was the work of ILM?4) The book is A LOT BETTER. I wondered how in hell they'd be able to squeeze all of it into a two and a quarter hour movie. Guess what? They failed. Miserably. At least they kept the butt-bustin' s***e weasels in. And personally, I don't remember this particular ending....4b) That being said, this movie should have been made into a miniseries with the s***e weasels as major characters.5) It's quite possible that Morgan Freeman's career may not recover after such a traumatizing blow. What the hell was he thinking and why were his eyebrows always at attention? And how many more military roles does Tom Sizemore have in him?6) Damian Lewis was good. Expect big things from him in the future. Actually, I liked the main group of friends. Even Duddits!7) But lest we forget, this movie sucks. It's bad. It's real bad.8) Ever step on a Lego piece barefoot? That's how painful watching this movie was.9) I hope to see a decent adaptation of a King book again someday but this one kind of made me feel hopeless and lost. Seriously, did the people in charge of this filth actually watch it before unleashing it on the audience? I can't understand how something like this could be let out of the gates in the first place.10) Wait for video, so you can avoid it at Blockbuster as well.11) Mr. King, I hope that you don't let them butcher the next book they decide to adapt. Please. Say something to them first.12) If you've already seen the movie, I'm sorry I couldn't stop you beforehand.Rating: *1/2 out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not so much a ***1/2 movie as a ***1/2 experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gestalt psychology is based around the idea that something in whole is more than the sum of its parts. Dreamcatcher challenges this approach and, in so, proves that its final product could never live up to the brilliance of its individual scenes. Ranging from taut, psychological horror to inept, absent-minded action, Dreamcatcher is more than just another Stephen King book-to-the-screen; it is the story that King is fortunate to tell.In one of the film's opening scenes, Jonesy is hit by a car. This plot turn hits close to home, because, in 1999, King was hit by a van. Dreamcatcher is the book that he wrote during his recuperation. Jonesy also survives his accident and is given a second chance. King uses the metaphor of an alien invasion to represent the things in life that we have no control over but, he argues, that we have the strength to overcome them. In a near-death experience we are told that our lives flash before our eyes, and that is exactly how you can describe Dreamcatcher. A concoction of great ideas never quite coming together, we see elements from nearly every King work from classics like Stand By Me to made-for-television disasters like The Langoliers.Ebert asks: `How can an alien that consists primarily of teeth and an appetite, that apparently has no limbs, tools or language, travel to Earth in the first place?' What he fails to mention is that there are three apparent species of aliens in Dreamcatcher-the weasels mentioned above, the stereotypical Signs' creature, and the interesting addition to the genre of an algae-like substance. And, to answer his question further, the weasels are born through the humans who accidentally ingest the algae, who then, in turn, reproduce asexually in the form of miniature weasels. It is a silly concept nonetheless, but isn't science fiction meant to be that way? For a film so long, Dreamcatcher always manages to entertain, and never to bore, even when Morgan Freeman's character, essential to the book but reduced to pointless filler in the movie, is on the screen. Dreamcatcher is not so much a three-and-a-half star movie as it is a three-and-a-half star experience.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an avid King fan and there aren't many of his books or stories that translate into good movies. I thought the forces behind this one did a great job of sticking to the story, and that Jason Lee WAS Beaver. (seems like my favorite characters always die first.) And the long term closeness between the friends was obvious without trying too hard. I loved Donnie Wahlberg's Duddits was great, but the child Duddits was amazing. I just want to know, where the heck did that ending come from??? Of course I saw it with a fellow King fan, and we both wanted to know if we'd read the wrong book. With the script staying so close to the original story, and the characters being so dead on, what happened there at the end? And of course, I came home, and had to get my copy out. I even enjoyed the imagery to show how Jonesy managed to stay apart from Mr. Gray in his own head, but the crazy alien transformation was a bit over the top. OK more than a bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the Stephen King novel, Dreamcatcher is not a movie for the squeamish! The film tells the story of four lifelong friends who all have strange telepathic abilities. These friends run into trouble when aliens crash land near their cottage in the woods. As the aliens begin to infect people with a wormlike parasite, an army Colonel played by Morgan Freeman is charged with containing the outbreak. My only problem with this movie is it tries to do too many things. If it had focused more on the brothers, or the army vs. aliens I think it would have been better off. For those looking for a thriller with a decent amount of suspense, this film may hold you over until the summer blockbuster season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terrible Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Contains Spoilers*The day Dreamcatcher opened in theaters, I ardently dragged my boyfriend out to be among the first to see this movie. Having read the book multiple times and being a devoted King fan, I couldn't wait to see what the big-screen had done to my second-favorite Stephen King novel of all time.As it turns out, barring a truly insightful acting job by Jason Lee as the Beav and a courageous attempt of unknown Damian Lewis at portraying Jonesy's semi-schizophrenic abductment by Mr. Gray (although the British accent was a little extreme, he portrayed the half-crazed smile well), the big screen has managed to murder one of my favorite stories. I mean, okay, the six-hundred-plus page book may not have been the easiest story to adapt to a two-hour movie, but this doesn't excuse the shameless and nonexistent twists of the original plot (I almost walked out of the theater when Duddits, who is in the novel a most-certainly remarkable human being with Down's syndrome and a sense of ESP/telepathy, but that is all, turned into a huge, prong-bearing alien figure), not to mention the absolute deletion of pivotal scenes AND the total flattening of the character of Abe Kurtz, who is, in the book, one of the most convincing, craziest, most unstable human characters I have ever come across in a novel. Usually I hold a great deal of faith in Morgan Freeman as an actor, but I am sorry to say the script made a mockery of a three-dimensional nutcase. I was constantly whispering to my boyfriend, "He's a real nut job, keep watching." Unfortunately, he had to go on my word, since this was never proven onscreen.I seethingly viewed the Hollywood- added special effects designed to spiff up what was ALREADY a riveting and complex plot and truly likeable characters. Rather than focusing on the emotional issues between and among the characters, the audience was treated to an unspectacular bouquet of fabricated helicopter chases, alien battle scenes, and ridiculous toothy, legless worms.The true heart and terror of the original book was entirely lost in all this. I felt none of the sadness I had originally known at the deaths of Beaver and Pete (indeed, the heartbreaking murder of Pete by the alien presence in the book was more riveting than the overdone movie scene in which the alien masquerading as Jonesy tears his head off), and none of the shock at Kurtz's systematic planned execution of hundreds of civilian and miltary personnel. Entirely besides this, the twisted, fascinating concept expressed in the end of the book of Jonesy HIMSELF being Mr. Gray (sort of a cohabitation- Jonesy allows the sort of "abduction" of the "Jekyll" part of his mind by a sort of "Hyde" personality- Mr. Gray- because he is psychologically conflicted) NEVER occurs in the movie. Indeed, all I really wanted by the time this was over was to walk out in disgust and return home to cleanse myself by reading the book once more. I'm disappointed in Stephen King for allowing such a ridiculous adaptation hit the theater in the first place. Despite the courageous attempt by the five actors to portray the friendship of Jonesy, Pete, Henry, Beav, and Duddits, this movie is only worth viewing if your only other choice is Piglet's Great Adventure. Especially if you loved the book, please, don't ruin it for yourself. Stay home and rent The Ring instead.3/10 Review by Krysten, 18-year-old college student</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Refreshing and Fascinating good time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up I was a huge fan of Stephen King's stuff. Though in the last 5 to 6 years I have only read "Desperation". So this marked one of the few times in my life that I would go into a film based on a King Novel and not have read the novel. I can say that without a doubt I loved this film, and as an old fan of Stephen King's work, I'd bet Mr. King loved this film as well. With the exception of a few, most of the films coming from Stephen King's novels have been ruined by unworthy directors. There have been more mini series directors whom seemed to have understood King's works, than feature film directors. That my friends is a sad, sad fact of life.Now, you may ask how without reading the book do I know this film did so well with Stephen King's work? The answer is clear, The dialogue of the film sounded like the dialogue from most of my favorite Stephen King novels. That, is something I can only say has happened in one other film "Stand By Me", and even that one fell a little short. Stephen King's characters are always an enigma within themselves. Each character possessing a certain dialogue that stands above the other characters. Jason Lee's performance as "Beaver" seemed as if though King himself was somehow controlling Lee's every action, and every mutter. The complex persona of Jonesy (complex due to reasons I will not give away) is pulled with brilliance by Damien Lewis. Once again Donnie Wahlberg delivers a "Where's Waldo?" performance. I did not even recognize him until toward the end of the film I asked myself "Wait where's Donnie wasn't he in this film?", it was then I realized he had been on the screen for the past 15 minutes leading a major sequence. As far as the acting there are no disappointments. Though I am certain most people are going to say that Freeman and Sizemore had ridiculous roles, those people need to realize that this film was meant to be over the top and at times a little cheesy. I hate films that over do it with the puns and ignorant humor. This film seems at times like it is going in that direction, but backs off just in time. I mean this is a tale of four friends who think they are super heros, a colonel gone mad, a green captain, and a race of strange creatures whom live off of deceit. I don't think you can expect a plot like that to come without a great deal of off the wall humor. The only disappoint I could see in this film was the character development. There is not information given enough about "Duddits", nor enough about "Colonel Kutz". However, as with all of the films based on King's stuff, there just is not enough time to get into the degree of character development as the novel. That is why the 3 best Stephen King related feature films have been based around his novellas (or short novels) {Stand By Me, The Shawshank Redemption, and Apt Pupil}. Feature film wise the only film that has been based on a longer story than was a great feature would be the Green Mile, which in itself is a longer film, with a big budget (Don't argue on the budget if you have Tom Hanks you have a big budget), so there you go. I think King fans will enjoy the dialogue of the characters and recognize that these film makers tried to show King fans, that they too were King fans. Overall the film is witty, visually stunning, and satisfying. The feel I got the film was refreshing. Hollywood is been so divided between art film and big budget crap, that it's a nice change to see a film that does not lie in either of those categories for a change. In the end there will be two kind of people those who love this film and those who hate it. You can try to straggle the fence if you want, but everyone eventually will make an ultimate decision on this one. I loved it. I hope others do as well. But for those who claim this was a film that ruined Stephen King's work. Let's not forget two things. Stephen King almost solely destroyed the horror film genre with his own feature "Sleep Walkers", and also though King has written some absolutely brilliant work, he unlike most "Great authors" is Awesome 40% of the time, Kinda Good 5 % of the time, and Terrible 55% of the time. That is why I grew up and moved to bigger and better things. There comes a time in one's life where Dungeons and Dragons, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Type O Negative, and Stephen King have to grow into Clive Barker. But that's just me.Scarecrow Man's Rating8 crows dead of a possible 10.</fullReview>

Previews make this movie look good, but in reality the only reason this film is worth seeing for the Animatrix short by Square Animation at the beginning. The characters are weak, the writing is weak, the acting is weak, and the plot is typical of TV movie. It's not scary, and the aliens look dumb. This film was a bust, I expect 'The Core' to be crap... but I am in for special effects if nothing else. Even the special effects in this movie were poorly done.Dreamcatcher is better than most of King's films... course that's not saying much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DREAMCATCHER: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGICAL HORROR FILM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah yes! Dreamcatcher has come out.I have been looking forward to this film for the last 2 years ever since the release of the massive novel by Stephen King. The film is about four friends, Jonesy (Damien Lewis), Henry (Thomas Jane), Pete (Timothy Olyphant) and Beaver (Jason Lee)who are psychically linked with each other, ever since they saved a handicapped boy named Duddits (Donnie Walhberg)...they take a trip into the woods of main in the middle of winter to do a little hunting. While on the trip Beaver and Jonesy encounter a hunter who is delirious and sick with really horrible gas. Henry and Pete are on their way from a store when they get into a bad accident. There was a dying woman in the middle of the road. At the same time Military Helicopters are flying overhead. This is called The Blue Group which is lead by a madman named Col. Kurtis (Morgan Freeman) and his second in command Owen Underhill (Tom Sizemore) who are sent in to quarantine an area that has experienced a crashed UFO that may cause harm to the world....This film is very scary and has a great special effects. It is very psychological and scary with **** weasels and Mr. Greys.*******SPOILERS*****I loved how the filmmakers stayed really close to the book. I loved the conversation about the memory storage bank was handle. The whole `Duddits' flash back was perfect as was the little who was cast. I was surprised they stuck to whole `make you eat this dog turd' scene. They could have botched it badly. Also the whole bathroom scene was done excellently with even the alien grabbing onto the privates of the Beaver. And they showed Mr. Grey perfectly, as i imagined him when i read the book.****END OF SPOLIERS******I was pleased with the pacing and how short it was. The novel is near 750 pages long and they were able to get into a 2 hour movie. If I were directing the film I would have made it three hours or even more. I was so engaged in the film. I absolutely loved it. It was a great movie. I saw it twice and I want see it again. I suggest it! It's very good.Rated R for extreme violence and strong language</fullReview>

Ok...that out of the way...the book was not that great to start with, so if anyone expected a classic going into this film they were bound to be disappointed. This was supposed to be a WEIRD movie, and you got exactly that. I thought the periods leading up to the tense scenes were very well acted, and I thought it followed the book quite well until the end...don't worry...no spoilers here. So...if you liked the Stephen King book, I think you will like the film. It even has Jonesy in his own mind...that was hard to pull off. Well-acted, well-directed...maybe not so well written to start with. I also thought it was visually well done. So...it was a good film...not a great film...but CERTAINLY better than anything else that opened in the last few weeks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher the book encompasses all of the things that have gone 'bump' inside all of our heads at one time or another. Dreamcatcher the movie tries to take a small bite out of the huge smorgasbord of the book and run it straight through all the extremes as it follows 4 childhood friends who led relatively uneventful lives until the day they meet Duddits (Andrew Robb/child and Donnie Wahlberg/adult). Duddits is a special child with special gifts and lessons to give to his friends. His friends just simply accept him and his gifts without too much question but they know that it is this common bond of "being weird" that will keep them together.As adults each of the four, Henry `H' Devlin (Thomas Jane), Gary `Jonesy' Jones (Damian Lewis), Joe "Beaver" Clarendon (Jason Lee) and Pete Moore (Timothy Olyphant), have had their successes and failures. Henry is a psychiatrist who finds himself resenting his patients. He knows what they're thinking and they are always thinking the same thing. One day he lets his dissatisfaction get the better of him and he lets one patient, Barry Nieman (C. Ernst Harth) know it. He tells Barry things that Barry has barely allowed himself to think let alone ever say out loud to anyone. Barry is completely humiliated and frightened by this and gets out of Henry's office in a hurry. Meanwhile, in a 'saved by the bell' moment, his friend, college professor Jonesy phones H just before the start of his meeting with a promising student who has been caught cheating on a test and Jonesy, perhaps seeing promise in the young man, gives David Defuniak (Jonathan Kasdan) a second chance. Then, just as Jonesy is leaving for the day, he almost gets his own 'saved by the bell' moment when friend Beaver gives him a call but isn't really sure why he called. The only person not saved by any bells was Pete. In fact, yet another belle shot him down.We fast forward 6 months and depressed Henry, crippled Jonesy, pitiful Pete and good-time Beaver have arrived at their hunting cabin for their 20th annual deer hunt. They enjoy what turns out to be their last night of drink, laughs and reminiscing before the whole world changes. Enter two lost and gastrointestinally afflicted hunters from another party, aliens and a special US Military task force to deal with them led by a Colonel who has a set of seriously scrambled marbles in his head. Colonel Curtis (Morgan Freeman) has spent so much of his career on top-secret missions that he is completely out of touch with reality. His second-in-command, Owen Underhill (Tom Sizemore), knows the guy is nuts but he also knows that if he lets his boss know what he knows then his goose is most thoroughly cooked. His only choice is to play along and wait for the cavalry to ride in and save the day. It doesn't take long for things to go from bad to worse and straight on into impossible.The acting is smooth; the 4 main adult characters are completely believable as lifelong buddies, the boys that portrayed them as children did a great job as did Andrew Robb as they young Duddits. The cinematography is outstanding; the opening title sequence is very cool, the CGI, animatronics and puppetry are among the best in the biz.Dreamcatcher is not your average movie. It's a story with so many familiar scenarios that some people seem to have gotten caught up with identifying these scenarios as cheap imitations, rip-offs, cop-outs and errors. It's not that at all.... it's deja vu. This story demands that you suspend your sense of logic and reason for 135 minutes. If you can do that and enjoy the animatrix short that preceded it, then why can't you do that with a film that has live human beings acting out the fictional lives of fictitious persons?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was drawn into this film in the first 10 minutes or so. I knew I wasgoing to like it once the set-up was complete. It's a fascinatingexercise in adapting a book, which is obviously much too much tofit into a movie, and still come out with a film that is coherent,which it is, full of surprises, which it is, and which alludes to the"more" of the book without being able to include it all.I'm glad I haven't read Stephen King's novel. It was actually quite alot of fun getting to see King's story through Kasdan's eyes. Insome ways, Kasdan must have improved on King's words, because there are sumptuous visual scenes which made methink, "Wow. That can't have been described in words." There's arichness of vision in this movie that's hard to find in any film of anyera.It's true some of the story lines seem disjointed, or maybeloose-jointed like a gangly teenager. There are the occasionalsegments that are obviously drawn straight out of the book in anattempt to follow it with some degree of faith, or to satisfy the fansof the novel. I think I took those with a little more grace than someof the other reviewers here.This is a difficult piece of work, and yes it has some flaws, but as awhole movie and knowing its origin in a Stephen King novel, I haveto rate it pretty darn high.It's definitely a big movie. Go see it on the big screen. It'll neverlook as good on a TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dreamcatcher"Film/ Novel Anaylsis :"Dreamcatcher" in my opinion is better than any other Stephen King book that I have ever read, with the acception of "The Talisman". Now with that being said, seeing the film was a give-in. I have never seen a film that effectively captured the true essence of his books on screen before. However, Lawrence Kasdan and writer William Goldman managed to do it. The adaptation is AMAZING. Every aspect needed to effectively portray the book on screen was captured. Even down to the smallest detail with things like Beaver's dialogue, and the description of the S**t weasels. You must remember however, that the book is 900 pages and had to be condensed down into a 2hr and 15min movie. With that being said, some aspects of the story had to be shortened. The ending is the only aspect that dissapointed me. It is completely different. But overall, I would have to say that this is the best adaptation of a Stephen King book that I have ever seen.Special Effects / Action :The special effects were nicely done. The psychic abilities of the characters were effectively captured on screen, and the s**t weasels were done exactly the way that the book described them. The action was also decent and featured some nice firepower.Acting :Morgan Freeman - He plays Abraham Kurtz. In the book, he is a menacing and dispicable villan. So instead of casting an actor who is well known for playing a villan, you cast Morgan Freeman who has done nothing but play a good guy role. It was impossible to take him seriously.Jason Lee - For Beaver, you cast Jason Lee. He will always be seen as Brody from Mallrats. He served as the film's comic relief. Even when harm is coming to his character, you find yourself wanting to laugh.Thomas Jane - He stars as Henry. In the book, Henry is the main hero, and is on the edge of committing suicide. Therefore, you need to have an actor that carries a wide variety of emotion. Thomas Jane speaks in a mono-tone for the whole film, and has absolutely no emotion. I felt like I was watching Keanu Reeves.Kids - The young actors chosen to play Henry, Pete, Beaver, and Jonsey as children did the worst job of all. They had absolutely no skill whatsoever.Now despite the efforts from Damian Lewis, Timothy Olyphant, Tom Sizemore, and Donnie Whalberg, the acting is the reason the film suffered. That is why I feel the adaptation dissapointed so many people. The story itself was effectively captured from the book. But if the wrong actors are chosen, it won't matter how good the adaptation is.Score : 7/10-vyperman 7</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was quite disappointed in this movie. It just didn't work. Now I know that King's books usually don't translate well into movies and this one was no exception. I haven't read this book yet, but it was obvious that many crucial elements of the story were left out and what the viewer got a crammed mess of a plot. I was intrigued by the movie and I will end up reading the book, but that doesn't make it good movie. For those of you who have never read any of King's works, he is a very good writer. He not only has a gift for creating an intriguing story, but he knows how to tell it well. One of the most crucial elements in of his works is how he takes you into his character's minds. That is one of the main reasons why his stories don't translate into film. I am an avid moviegoer, but movies can't consistently show how a person thinks. If you want to enjoy Stephen King read his books. I give this movie *** (out of 10).</fullReview>

The dialog was changed to meaningless jibberish, and key concepts weren't given enough airtime to sink in.Not just that, but they changed the ending to make a stab at wowing the CGI crowd.I wish someone had taken more of a responsibility in the screenplay and direction. Its so embarassing for the author when his book ends up in the trash can this way.Stay away at all cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DREAMCATCHER: THE NEW PSYCHOLOGICAL HORROR FILM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah yes! Dreamcatcher has come out.I have been looking forward to this film for the last 2 years ever since the release of the massive novel by Stephen King. The film is about four friends, Jonesy (Damien Lewis), Henry (Thomas Jane), Pete (Timothy Olyphant) and Beaver (Jason Lee)who are psychically linked with each other, ever since they saved a handicapped boy named Duddits (Donnie Walhberg)...they take a trip into the woods of main in the middle of winter to do a little hunting. While on the trip Beaver and Jonesy encounter a hunter who is delirious and sick with really horrible gas. Henry and Pete are on their way from a store when they get into a bad accident. There was a dying woman in the middle of the road. At the same time Military Helicopters are flying overhead. This is called The Blue Group which is lead by a madman named Col. Kurtis (Morgan Freeman) and his second in command Owen Underhill (Tom Sizemore) who are sent in to quarantine an area that has experienced a crashed UFO that may cause harm to the world....This film is very scary and has a great special effects. It is very psychological and scary with **** weasels and Mr. Greys.*******SPOILERS*****I loved how the filmmakers stayed really close to the book. I loved the conversation about the memory storage bank was handle. The whole `Duddits' flash back was perfect as was the little who was cast. I was surprised they stuck to whole `make you eat this dog turd' scene. They could have botched it badly. Also the whole bathroom scene was done excellently with even the alien grabbing onto the privates of the Beaver. And they showed Mr. Grey perfectly, as i imagined him when i read the book.****END OF SPOLIERS******I was pleased with the pacing and how short it was. The novel is near 750 pages long and they were able to get into a 2 hour movie. If I were directing the film I would have made it three hours or even more. I was so engaged in the film. I absolutely loved it. It was a great movie. I saw it twice and I want see it again. I suggest it! It's very good.Rated R for extreme violence and strong language</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a few comments about film/book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well let's see.....so many people who say that they have read the book cannot seem to remember just how many actuall pages there were. There were 621 pages. Anyway, I read the box it took me 8 days and I finished it the night before the film opened so the memory of it was very vivid in my mind. I understand that a director cannot put everything into a movie that was found in the book due to the constraints of time. But who says that a film cannot be over 2 hours and 16 minutes long? Titanic was 3 1/2 hours long. Just about everything could have been included in it had the film just been longer. I am sure that just about everyone that was going to see the film has so by now and for those that did not have the absolute pleasure of reading the book, I have a few comments. Yes, as stated by other posters, the first 200 or so pages were dead on in the movie. With the exception of the big alien standing in the cabin in front of Jonesy, but I can deal with it. But in the book, the townspeople that had been detained in the barn were able to be persuaded by Henry to overpower the military through their mindreading capability which in the movie only the 5 main characters were able to do. The "ripley" or "byrus" (disease) gave each of those affected that ability which gave the aliens such a powerful upperhand. The scene in the movie where Kurtz was chasing down Underhill, Henry, and Duddits in a chopper was completely different than in the book where they were being chased by Kurtz in a Hum-V and 3 other people (two of which had been affected with the disease) and one of those people (character) was not even in the movie at all, the one that helped Kurtz track them down using his mind-reading and telepathy ability. Those scenes alone would not have taken more than maybe another 45 minutes to show. The scene with the bacon that everyone keeps talking about would have been crucial because the "real" Jonesy, while being trapped in the (mental) warehouse, was constantly trying to play mind games with Mr Gray (the alien that was becoming more and more human as the book went on). And those mental games Jonesy would play were only meant to slow Mr Gray down from getting to the reservoir and allow Underhill, Henry, and Duddits to catch up to him. But the most difficult part of the entire movie I had trouble with was the ending. Duddits was never an alien in the book as the movie portrayed. If he was an alien, then what the heck was his mother? The alien queen from planet LV426 in the movie Aliens? Come on now. That to me was the worst part. I could have dealt with the deletions and minor differences that movie already had, but that was sad. I still enjoyed the movie though only because it was from a Stephen King book but I just wish it were shot better. I for one would have sat through a 3 hour movie. Thanks for listening. A true Stephen King fan. Dave</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful. But for all the wrong reasons!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You just can't make a good movie from a Stephen King novel. What he writes just doesn't seem to translate well on film. The horror comes off as something less than evil, and more laughable than anything else. That said, I have to say that Dreamcatcher is one of the most entertaining films of the year. Not because of the horror, but because Lawrence Kasden brings together relationships better than almost any director. You care about the four friends who are given a rare power by a rather strange young man they help when they are children. The cast is great, and Donnie Wahlberg will freak you out. Forget the reviews and leave reality outside the theater. The less you think about the holes in the plot, the better off you'll be. Enjoy the hell out of this movie. I did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The problem with `Dreamcatcher' lies in the fact that trying to convert a Stephen King novel is no easy task.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My initial response after walking out of the theater was, `I just don't know how to feel about this one.' I couldn't really complain about the acting; it was good, as was the direction from Lawrence Kasdan (`Mumford,' `French Kiss'). However, I think the real problem with `Dreamcatcher' lies in the fact that trying to convert a Stephen King novel is no easy task. As a matter of fact, it's bewildering. Between an intricate plot and troubled characters, trying to transform a novel of such magnitude into a two hour, and sixteen minute film is nearly impossible. But Kasdan did it, with flaws mind you. There are moments in the film that just seem to drag on and left me feeling drowsy. Then there are those moments when your hands are clenching the arms of the seat, trying to hold back your fear of what's about to happen on the screen. To describe `Dreamcatcher,' first consider this notion-it's `Close Encounters Of The Third Kind' combined with a really twisted episode of `The X-Files.' It's the story of four friends, while on a weekend camping trip, encounter a stranger in the woods with a bizarre bruise on his face. Between this stranger's unusual story of being lost in the woods to his constant flatulence problem, the men try to help him by providing food and a place to rest. However, these four friends have no idea of the events that are about to take place around them-a government quarantine of the area and the appearance of ?visitors' who overtake the mind of the one of the campers, played by Damian Lewis. Now one of the four friends (Thomas Jane) must try to stop a renegade colonel (Morgan Freeman) from killing innocent civilians, and what's more, the destruction of the human race from the mysterious ?visitors.' Among the flaws that exist in `Dreamcatcher,' probably the biggest one of them all is that the story is too elaborate. When dealing with film, one has to realize that there are limits, unlike a book in which an author's world is infinite. For one, generally you don't want to make your film too long or else your audience could get bored. Second, it's easy to confuse the audience with too many plot intricacies. That was the problem that many critics agreed upon with Cameron Crowe's `Vanilla Sky,' the remake of a Spanish film called, `Abre Los Ojos.' I was able to understand `Dreamcatcher's' story line, but I couldn't help but feel disconcerted by the whole thing; it was just too much. And the film was rather long, with trailers and a short computer animated skit prior to the film, `The Animatrix,' which was actually quite impressive. Performances in the film were good, but nothing great. Morgan Freeman is usually a good bet when casting a film. His role here reminded me of the Wolfgang Peterson film, `Outbreak,' in which he also played a military official pushed to the extreme in extraordinary circumstances. Thomas Jane, the lead actor in this film, has been in several films including `Face/Off,' `Deep Blue Sea,' and more recent romantic comedy, `The Sweetest Thing,' which starred Cameron Diaz. All in all, `Dreamcatcher' proves to be too complex for it's own good, not to mention that there are some very grotesque scenes along with frightening monster-like beings. I would like to see it again, actually, because I feel as if I missed some vital parts of the story. I have heard that it more or less stays truthful to the King novel, but audience reaction seems to be mixed. **1/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only thing this Steven King movie and the Shawshank Redemption have in common is their film length.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is The Big Chill meets Alien meets Stand by Me meets E.T. Unfortunately, it combines aspects from all in a mishmash of big budget special effects, famous actors and a plot thats all over the place. The main problem with this movie is not that the explanation of the plot makes no sense, but that there is no explanation. We never know anything about the aliens or their intentions, characters take their sweet time when the world is in danger and there are laughable moments that should be frightening. The movie also thinks that because Stephen King wrote the book, they can blatantly steal scenes from the movie "Stand by Me", showing images of 4 boys (one being a Corey Feldman look alike) walking along train tracks in search of a lost youth. They should at least try to be different. The film-makers also try to excuse themselves by calling the alien disease "Ripley" 'after the Alien chick', attempting to give themselves a license to steal from the Alien movies. Whatever dialogue there was flew by and made little sense, and it is yet another movie where this job is the last for Morgan Freeman (Nurse Betty, Seven, etc). Finally, in the end, the movie loses all credibility and settles into a mix of Rambo 3 and rejected scenes from Men in Black 2. The movie gets a fitting punishment by failing to surpass a three week old stale comedy (Bringing Down the House) and being considered even worse than the old Stephen King films from the horrendous film decade, the eighties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many have said, Dreamcatcher starts out really well, with some interesting characters and intriguing scenes. Then, after about 40 minutes or so, it descends into implausibility, imcomprensibility and unintentional hilarity. A huge mis-step for everyone involved. I haven't read the book but I get the impression from the film that they are pole vaulting through it. The movie makes some leaps and like so many movies based on books, it presents scenes that might have worked in a book where you hear the inner monologue but on the screen they are just absurd. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, this is not a great movie by any means, and yes, it does mess around with the book more than I would have liked (especially at the end). However, you've got to realize that this is not based on a book of The Stand's or It's caliber. The book also doesn't lend itself well to the filmic transition because much of it is cerebral. It is almost impossible to get the friends' bond onscreen because much of that has to do with what they think and how they feel, which was there in the book. You cannot do that in any movie because any voiceover narration (a la Stand by Me) would reveal who survives and that was part of the great shock of the book. When the first character dies, it felt like a deep loss, while in the movie, you're still getting over how much you like or hate how the crap weasels look. In this sense, the movie was failed from the beginning. I felt that they did do justice to a number of things. The deaths were gruesome, which was important. You had to feel these things. The crap weasels should have had more of an "Alien" chest-busting vibe out the back door, but that would lead to fanboys screaming "rip-off," etc., even though that's the way they appeared in the book. I give the filmmakers massive props for the blood-spilled, since many a lesser filmmaker would trim it down for that sellout PG-13, especially with the Animatrix clip at the front of the film (even though that would break that new rule about "not marketing R rated films to minors thing," Warner Bros. could have sunk to that level with the whole Superman debacle). More love goes to the filmmakers for taking the care to have Jonesy's "mental" office hideaway be the exact office that they saw as kids down to the Maine map that appears in both places. I know that sounds like a small thing, but it's suprising how often things like that are thrown away. Speaking of thrown away, I disagree with that phrase being used for Morgan Freeman. Yes, the role wasn't well fleshed-out, but the man's been playing a detective since Seven (or Se7en if you prefer). I'm glad he was able to break that typecasting curse, but I hope that he'll find some meatier roles. Other unnecessary complaints that I've noticed include the red dust looking like crap. Look, the only way to be able to control the dust to see the guy breathing it in is to have CG dust. Sorry, it's the truth, get over it. It worked for me, just like most of the movie did for me, the ending excluded. If you're worried about it, wait until DVD whereyou may be able to get some answers on the filmmakers' choices.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what sort of nightmares does Stephen King have</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin, no I have not read the book, so who knows how my comments would be otherwise... However, I can say that I did enjoy the film. I am not one to go out of my way to see an alien sci-fi thriller sort of flick, yet I can respect and enjoy all sorts of movies. Dreamcatcher managed to be a film that held my attention all the way through, something very few major pics achieve these daze.Yes, I may just be that strange individual (or perhaps immature, but I have to warn you that I am far from a 14 yr old boy) who could find humor in gastrointestinal issues and nasty crap exploding from peoples' anuses. This lowkey style of humor rocked my world.More importantly Jason Lee had a fairly major role and he rocks my world, too. There's something about him that draws you in, despite his dorky demeanor in this film. And the fact that Donnie Wahlberg was Didditz, well I don't even know how to comment on that, let's just say I was quite impressed/surprised.Overall it was an entertaining movie. The way in which they draw you into Jonesy's inner world is really well done, and I have to give the actor props for his external battle between normal Jonesy speak and British alien dude (should we even question that alien accent).Bottom line: I'm not a big alien movie fan, but Dreamcatcher caught me with its style and wit. After seeing it I can only begin to imagine what runs through Stephen King's head on a regular basis.</fullReview>

Morgan Freeman shouldn't have been in this movie. It was nice to see Jason Lee outside of a Kevin Smith flick. Donnie Wahlberg has come a long way from NKOTB. Oh, and I don't ever,ever, EVER wanna go to Derry, Maine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was the movie this bad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so disjointed. The flashbacks were placed at very awkward times. It really didn't seem to know whether it was about the four friends or just an average hollywood thriller. Although there were moments of decent acting, they were buried under an avalanche of horrible writing. And the ending where all that suspense lead up to a final alien fight that lasted about 30 seconds, HORRIBLE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what sort of nightmares does Stephen King have</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin, no I have not read the book, so who knows how my comments would be otherwise... However, I can say that I did enjoy the film. I am not one to go out of my way to see an alien sci-fi thriller sort of flick, yet I can respect and enjoy all sorts of movies. Dreamcatcher managed to be a film that held my attention all the way through, something very few major pics achieve these daze.Yes, I may just be that strange individual (or perhaps immature, but I have to warn you that I am far from a 14 yr old boy) who could find humor in gastrointestinal issues and nasty crap exploding from peoples' anuses. This lowkey style of humor rocked my world.More importantly Jason Lee had a fairly major role and he rocks my world, too. There's something about him that draws you in, despite his dorky demeanor in this film. And the fact that Donnie Wahlberg was Didditz, well I don't even know how to comment on that, let's just say I was quite impressed/surprised.Overall it was an entertaining movie. The way in which they draw you into Jonesy's inner world is really well done, and I have to give the actor props for his external battle between normal Jonesy speak and British alien dude (should we even question that alien accent).Bottom line: I'm not a big alien movie fan, but Dreamcatcher caught me with its style and wit. After seeing it I can only begin to imagine what runs through Stephen King's head on a regular basis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's no Aliens but it's not that bad ethier. With some scares, and cool cg effects, the movie rockets though with good pacing (untill the end when it seams a bit rushed. Iv'e read the book and I believe there was things that could have been done better, but ,hey, Its a movie and can only be so long. Some of the themes get lost in the action and fast pace, and thats what makes it an action movie instead of a drama. Over all I enjoyed being scared although I already knew what was coming. It was a cool flick that I enjoyed with James Howard Newton's creepy sound-track helping the film on a bit. The Cinamatografy (sp) was nice, and also the effects (as I have alread stated). I thought one of the high points of the movie was Damian Lewis (Jonsey) was excellent, and one of the main reasons why I liked the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a major disappointment of a film with high expectations and talents attached to it. Stay away, read the book for the first time or read it again. My review of the film occurred during the end of it. When it became clear that Kasdan cheapened the story with `his' climax -- hinted at earlier in the film -- I said aloud in the theatre, `F*&amp;K me Freddie!' This was a favorite saying of the characters and highly appropriate at that point in the film.The first hour of this film was very well done in adapting the book to the screen. The way the Memory Warehouse was to be handled was going to be difficult but Kasdan pulled it off. In the first half, Kasdan also did an excellent job in the character development (his hallmark) of four of the five friends. He left Duddits' out except peripherally and it becomes clear after the film moves out of the hunting cabin why. Of note was the young actor playing Beaver. He was outstanding. However, right after Mr. Gray's explosion, the film deteriorates into an abysmal mess.Where do I begin at how bad this movie failed to adapted Stephen King's excellent novel and where do I place the blame? Do I blame Kasdan for being brilliant in the first hour and totally horrid in the last? Do I take Kasdan to task for not trusting his audience to `get it?' Hold up his negligence for his cheapening of the excellent story by skipping the Byrus explanation and all that goes with it? The telepathic effects, how the weasels were mutations and NOT supposed to kill their hosts. Changing the way Mr. Gray kills and acquires his vehicles and information into something unbelievable. Leaving out some potentially great cinematic sequences in the chase to Derry and then Massachusetts. Or rail at him for the really stupid ending?Maybe I look at Stephen King for having, yet again, given up a great chunk of creative control of his literary work as it appears in another medium? What is the reason that allows him to let studios make a mockery of his work? What was painstakingly crafted into a highly entertaining story and turned into so much mush and pulp. Literally!This is like the chicken or the egg conundrum. If King does not give up complete control, Kasdan can't screw it up. If Kasdan trusts his audience AND keeps using the great cinematic devices like the introduction and explanation of the warehouse, then this review would be different. But then, so would the movie. Ultimately they are both responsible for a disappointing experience.Because of the way King handles his prose and Kasdan the beginning of the movie, this should have been an above average, maybe even good Sci-Fi/drama. Instead it becomes a grade B film. The campy, contrived ending dooms it.</fullReview>

I hate scary movies, Signs STILL gives me nightmares, but this one was an exception. They show the alien's true form once, and even then it isnt scary. The other form is a giant worm thing with big teeth that isnt scary at all! The characters are great, the action is great, the story is great, it's all around a great film. You understand about the kids' powers as the movie progresses, and it leaves you on the edge of your seat until the last frame. Just go see it.

		<shortDescription>See the film first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to take this adaptation on its own merits. The scares work. Inclusion of other sub-plots from the novel would have made the film episodic and diffused the tension as well as appearing to trivialize real life issues like the concentration camp which are part the narrative, not to mention a raid on "humanized" aliens which may play with unintentional pathos and weight in a time when current events provide a parallel. There is more than two hours of entertainment, even without the Animatrix short which alone is packed with entertainment. I think Kasdan was right to pair this down, and I'm delighted to see him on in the big budget realm again and as a director. The internal monologues and other textures Stephen King weaves into the book will just be another thing to discover if the movie intrigues you enough to look further. My only caveat is that I think the tension of horror and suspense was a little more fun and less intense when I was a teen. Or is that my imagination?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreamcatcher...it's good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over this past Summer I had read Dreamcatcher and I was amazed by the book. WhatI find rather humorous is that when I was reading it I often thought to myself how the movie would look, because obviously, since Stephen King wrote it, it would probably end up being a movie by some point. Obviously, I wasn't wrong. I felt that the director of this film did a very good job adapting this story and for the most part staying with the true story line. However, I was dissapointed with the ending. The ending as a whole wasn't bad but it differed much from that of the movie so it came as quite a shock to see what they did with it. What I really liked about this film was the casting; it was superb, plain and simple. I have been a fan of Thomas Jane since I saw *61 because I am a huge Mickey Mantle fan and I've been a great fan of Jason Lee, well, since forever. Not to mention Morgan Freeman who is cool in everything he does. However, at times I felt the acting slipped quite a bit, especially in the beginning. There is a woman in the beginning of the movie who is just horrible and in many of the flashback scenes the child actors were anything but terrific. Putting that aside it was a good movie. The visuals on the aliens was very good and being that it was a horror/science fiction movie it had the ability to scare and for me that counts a lot to a horror movie's credit. I would definitely reccommend seeing this movie. The acting is good and the story, thanks to Stephen King, is just as good.</fullReview>

I was afraid that it would be another bad alien thing where super intelligent beings can't figure out how to use a door *cough* Signs *cough*... Anyway the movie was very good as far as plot and development, the action and premise was all logical and well done. However, I am very surprised how violent this movie was. Lawrence Kasdan has done very little violence. In fact, with the exception of Wyatt Earp, I can't think of any violence I've ever seen in one of his movies (besides sci-fi of Star Wars), though I have yet to see Silverado. I think everyone did very well, acting was great, camera work great, amazing special effects (especially the end). Just a fair warning though, the violence descriptor is there for a good reason.</fullReview>

This movie follows the same path, except this movie was really good for the first hour. *Spoiler I Guess* When you find out about aliens, the movie just declines rapidly followed by an unimaginitive ending. So, if you're looking for a good 1hr suspense flick, go see this and leave after the bathroom scene. If you want a sci-fi alien invasion movie like Signs, then this is your movie.</fullReview>

But as often is with book-to-movie flicks, you get dissapointed. And i think this is a very hard book to make into a movie, the characters in the book have many subtle inner struggles and problems that when crammed into a 2 hour movie just seem weird. And why they needed too make it so hollywood i will never understand, they use way to much special effects and still leaves you with a "thats it??" kind of feeling.No, i suggest you read the book and pretend you never heard of the movie.</fullReview>

I love that 1-800-Henry part, it's just hilarious. Also the parts about the friendship between the boys, it's really touching.However, all the blood and guts and the shooting and eating each others between humans and aliens, it's just not necessary. A good horror movie doesn't always require blood flying around and disgusting creatures floating everywhere. Besides that, I think the ending is just one of those typical ones how everyone expects it.One thing I have never had a chance to figure out, is that what is the point of the dreamcatcher in the story except for the fact that it represents the friendship among the boys, but other than that, I don't really see how it connects to the story as a whole....Afterall, I think it's an ok movie, but I think they could do a better job on it.

His novels usually are.King's stories are so similar though that when I heard about this movie, I almost figured out what was going to happen (except for the lovely butt unplugging aliens).Four childhood friends reunite and try to stop aliens from taking over the world. (Can you say "IT" or "Stand By Me") I mean Stand by Me's kids bonded together to fend off Keifer Sutherland and the kids in IT banded together to stop Pennywise.Anyway the grown up group has special powers that were given to them by another friend who we don't see until the last 15 minutes of the movie but he's talked about and seen in flashbacks. Guess who and how they defeat the aliens?The aliens are kinda hokie/campy and if you like blood you may like this movie. I for one was disappointed and luckily I saw it for free. If you're looking for Green Mile or Shawshank Redemption quality, look elsewhere!</fullReview>

Check out my ReviewDreamcatcher isnt your ordinary alien movie, its got some great thrills and is pretty gory! I would have to say that this is the best alien movie I have ever seen, the creature effects rules, and there were some great kills. I liked how the aliens had a kind of defense mechanism that would make there bodies explode and hurt people in its surroundings. There is this great scene where helicopters are shooting at the space ship type of thing and there are seriously 1,000s of these creature that are fleeing towards this ship, and 2 helicopters storm down and get caught in one of there defense mechanisms from the ship, and it explodes with blood taking down the ship. Its pretty brutal stuff. I would also have to say that this is the best Steven King movie ever, I would like to read the book some time to see the difference. I highly recommend this movie to all alien fans. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miscast and Poorly Adapted to Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read Dreamcatcher and thought it was a very entertaining book. Not necessarily scary the entire way through but certainly the strength of the characters made it a read worth finishing. While there certainly were some elements of the novel that were brought to film superbly, the s***-weasels and other visuals and sets, what was not transcribed were the characters. Morgan Freeman was completely miscast as General Kurtz, taking the fire and wit from what would otherwise be a colorful and explosive character. Other characters, Pete, Beaver, were sadly one-dimensional and even other main characters, Henry and Jonesy, seemed fighting for credibility as real human beings. The script took many elements of the novel and cheesed them, the audience I watched it with were constantly laughing at events that should have otherwise been serious. The movies brainless, a poorly constructed puzzle of events that never allows the satisfaction of a full picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so hyped for this one, after liking the book a lot. The first half is very faithful to the book, and everything goes perfect. Once you hit the second half though, you have to wonder how they dropped the ball so bad. It turns into nothing more than a cheap looking cgi-fest. The aliens look retarded, the worms looked even worse, even the helicopters looked extremely fake. Another bad thing was that there was too much material to cover from the novel to actually spend more time with the characters. Freeman and Sizemore are completely wasted, and arent even given a good final scene together. Jason Lee seems to be sleepwalking through his role. Thomas Jane is good as usual, and Timothy Olyphant does a great job with what little he has to work with, but the only real good acting job was Damian Lewis, but even his goofy performance wasn't enough. And what was with the death scenes? OK Beav's death was pretty much the way it happened in the novel, fine. But Pete's death? COME ON. They could have spent a lot less money on cgi and had a more disturbing death just by using what was there in the novel.Where was all the fun stuff with Mr. Gray enjoying being human? Where was the civilian uprising destroying the camp? Why in gods name did they make Duddits an ALIEN?! Overall, huge disappointment, but entertaining I guess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>alright, so its a THING/Phantoms ripoff, ok, now that thats over with... this movie was pretty damned good. first i thought it was trying to be serious, until all the jokes came in, then i knew it was a horribly campy b-movie. aliens come to town only to get wasted by morgan freeman, and its up to a bunch of psychics to help save the world!some seriously interesting backstory, and some neato psychic tricks (a definite scanners homage in here) play into this movie. the alien doesent burst out of your chest like in ALIEN, instead it causes flatulence and goes out the back end. some EXCELLENT one-liners "I'm not bleeding" + "Sit tight!" make this one seriously campy scifi-alien movie to add to a marathon. if you liked this check out the Thing + Phantoms + Scanners + Alien + Stargate SG1 (for the worms).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thumbs down for Dreamcatcher! I was pretty stoked about this film after catching the preview, but be warned the intriguing trailer is a trap into a while of unoriginal and brutally tasteless cinematography. This movie belongs on the same shelf with the rest of the bad alien flicks (pick one) and borrows heavily from them. Ultimately, this film came too late since it takes much more than a few cheap effects and body snatching space worms to impress todays moviegoers. And besides, we've proven to be able to create sophisticated Sci-Fi films to even consider releasing such junk. What did surprise me was the cast that sported cool names like Morgan Freeman, Thomas Jane and Tom Sizemore actors that aren't easily associated with Science Fiction let alone stale cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had the potential but failed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I few month ago I finished listening to the audio book "Dreamcatcher". Though it was not the best one, it got me involved in all the action and I was waiting what is happening next because of all the chasing moments, the mystery of who and what is Duddits, it kept me wanting to come back and finish it. Now, I had a lot of moments when I said to myself that this would be a good movie scene (I am a photographer who also likes taking video). I thought that is somebody would make a movie out of it, this would be something to enjoy and recommend to my friends. I was wrong... Not that somebody should make a movie, but what will the interpretation look like because you can't put every scene in the movie based on what is happening in the book. Now, saying that, I would prefer the books version of most of the action scenes. I do get it that in the book, we have a lot of things in between action scenes, a lot of detailed memories of Duddits, more background detail of characters. Also, in the movie they had to adjust everyones character by the person is chosen to play them to sound more natural, but that failed and back- fired. Though the main characters did not fail completely, side characters were chosen just wrong. They rushed through the ending creating completely new scenario and wasted to much time on making main characters friendship believable. First half of the movie more or less is based by the book, but then it goes sideways , skipping important moments and watching the movie one part just killed it for me... It's Duddits mothers scene. In the book it felt emotional but then she said "...now go save the world" and raised her hands I just said "nooooo" because it was an insult! She was even smiling before while preparing her sun to go not even mentioning that she wants to come with him, how she loves him, nope, just smiling and putting things for the trip. The ending is a hole new category of imagination. Though it follows the main concept what Mr. Grey wanted to do, they ruined it. I don't even care that is not the same as in the book, but it looked rushed and cheap by itself. It shows how far away the writers are from Stephen King. I won't make any more remarks about the movie. I will just share what I think would have been a better solution - don't make a 2 hour movie - make a TV series keeping everything as it was in the book, just put more side stories of other people around that area, travel more to the past, connect it more the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable mish-mash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You never know what you're going to get from a Stephen King book-to-film adaptation. Normally, you find yourself watching something that looks like it should be on a lesser-known cable TV station starring actors less famous than your gran.Then you get the occasional gem (IT, Pet Sematery and The Mist are my favourites of recent times). However, even those are pretty low budget. I can't think of any Stephen King film that has been given much money to play with. Then came Dreamcatcher. Not only does it star Morgan Freeman (possibly the most famous actor to grace a King film in a long time), but also there are some pretty damn fine special effects to go with it.Now, as everyone knows, special effects do not a movie make (Transformers 2, I'm looking at you), so, luckily, the supporting cast play their parts well.Dreamcatcher is about aliens, or the 'underused baddies of our generation' as I call them. Normally they only pop up on the sci-fi channel, or on some mega-budget Independence Day style blockbuster. Then again, perhaps I should say that it's MAINLY about aliens. Dreamcatcher's main problem is that it doesn't pick a direction and go with it. Instead it tries to go in every direction and sort of falls short on all counts. Not that the film wasn't fun. I enjoyed it. Many films go on too long and are dragged out. However, this one probably needs more story to it. I could see it working better as a TV series where each idea is given more time to develop it. Apart from aliens, there's psychic powers, alternate states of existence, childhood flashbacks and a few more besides.Like I say, overall it's fun, but could either have done with having a few plot lines taken out to streamline it, or expand on everything and make it longer.At least it tells us one valuable life lesson: Never help a stranger in the woods who breaks wind too often for your liking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's play a game. I'm going to list some plot points from Dreamcatcher, and you'll respond with the first word that comes to mind. Ready? Here we go.Intergalactic eels that infect a human host and eventually escape through said person's anus. Telepathic extra-terrestrials who crack jokes in a British accent. Telepathic humans who use handguns to make phone calls. These three things (more or less) sum up the massive failure of a novel- turned-movie that Lawrence Kasdan unleashed upon the world in 2003. It's clunky, awkwardly staged, and as disjointed as some pour soul who's taken a tumble down Solomon's staircase.I'll try to make this as painless as possible, so here goes my attempt to summarize the "story." Four friends who saved a mentally challenged peer from ridicule at a young age are granted extrasensory powers. When they're older, they use these abilities to excel at their professions. Eventually, they realize they're part of a larger effort to stop the spread of a blood-thirsty alien race who wants nothing more than to unleash it's malignant slug offspring into the water supply of the City of Boston.Besides the fact that the movie is anything but scary, it's got some of the worst acting I've seen in quite some time. On top of that, Star Wars style screen-wipes are suddenly thrown into the mix about halfway through. These inadvertently create a much more lighthearted tone than Stephen King (or anyone else involved) could have possibly intended.Then there's the decision to focus on a small group of friends for the first third of the film. This actually has some promise, as the audience is primed for an isolated psychological thriller that allows the inner "beasts" of each of these characters to be fully developed (and eventually released).But that's not what happens.Instead, we're forced to watch various military officials bark orders at one another and spill everything they know about the impending infection. Whatever happened to "show, don't tell?"I haven't even mentioned the hilariously terrible helicopter battle that ensues between Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore (and, before that, gelatinous aliens pretending to be good guys), but take my word for it.This movie sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SSDD : Same S*** Different Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what it is about Stephen King that the movie industry feel they have to adapt so terribly. I'm a fan of Stephen King's work but lets just say, he's cursed when it comes to adaptations, one of the decent ones I've re-watched recently being The Mist which I think they did a pretty good job on. Foolishly enough I hoped this one would be good too as it had the same actor in, but sadly neither Thomas Jane nor Morgan Freeman could save it (and if Morgan Freeman can't, then no one can.) I probably should have skipped this in the first place knowing how bad Stephen King's work is on the big screen (with some exceptions obviously, The Shining NOT being one of these exceptions, but that's to rant about on a different page) There's just not enough depth to the characters in the film that can be evoked from reading the actual text. replace the last D with director and this film really is SSDD in terms of Stephen King adaptations. Don't waste your time on it. Watch something else instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it went down something like this. One day a writer rang to a producer and said, "Listen, I heard that you are in a need of a bad sci-fi horror film?", in which the producer said, "Why, yeees.". So the writer then went on and said, "I have this script that is based on Stephen Kings Dreamcatcher and it is basically about alien poop.". And to this the producer ecstatically replied, "Why... there's a doomed endeavor if I've ever heard of one.".And a little later a movie, of which I really couldn't decide, if it was supposed to be serious sci-fi horror or a flat out parody, was made.What is most frustrating in this movie, is the mere fact, that it has a solid cast. This solid cast, including Morgan Freeman, Tom Sizemore, Thomas Jane and Jason Lee utter so terrible dialog and that I didn't know to laugh or to cry, so in the end I was just mesmerized from how they could perform in this story with a straight face.I could mention the badly done action scenes, but instead of that I just say, ass weasels in my memory warehouse indeed.</fullReview>

But I was disappointed, as soon as the first person to crap out an alien did so. Then I became angry and insulted when the main character was taken over by Mister Grey. Which was just ridiculous. With a British accent? Give me a break. I thought these were aliens? Not the British. It was painful to sit through and I paid money to see it as well, I was annoyed and happened to look over at my boyfriend, who had fallen asleep half way through which made me jealous at the fact that I couldn't do the same.(I'm a light sleeper).

		<fullReview>After reading a few of the reviews for this 2003 flick I find some of the harsh criticism not entirely justified. First, I am not a fan or reader of Stephen King, so this film comes to me without any of that baggage.This film is crafted and videographed , state of the art. Clearly to me , after watching about half, its not to be taken too seriously. Although it stole some material from other flicks including Star Wars, that crazy Brit accent of the possessed Jonsie, the gestating toothed egg layers from Aliean, the little gray humanoids plus the kids with dream weaver special effects, from Spielburg's sanitized and marsh mellowed minded family film, Close Encounters of Third Kind. Despite all the plagiarizing, and dumb out of sequence scenes, I still, enjoyed it.The film must have been expensive to produce. I liked the scenes and campy acting, anyone who thought this was a serious non dark humor satire film, your IQ must be room temperature.The way the characters behave at the Maine cabin after being invaded is funny beyond belief. You have to be open minded and not a prude. Lots of dialog about scotums , jerk offs, and such. Did this really add a thing to the flick? No, it was one of its very silly weak points.Why suddenly a black guy comes into this whole mess with a string of obscene words and phony macho posturings can only be taken as more dark satire on cinema.In my opinion there was enough material here for at least three good Sci-FIs and one certainly on par with the best of Spielburg.If the writers had cut everything except the teenage boys and their adventures with a alien, the film could have been five stars.But, I assume the producers wanted to masturbate with this one and did that, plus more too. It was despite the crazy antics, entertaining.I bought this as a DVD for 3.90 dollars plus tax, so how could I really be dissatisfied?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie did the book no justice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have almost all the novels written by Stephen King. And I have also watched all the adaptations, and I can say with no hesitation, that this movie was by far the worst adaptation of a great novel. The screenplay was horrible, the Acting was absolutely rubbish, and the general story was twisted and warped a lot from the original, so many elements from the novel were literally *Cut out*.The biggest flaw I see in this movie is its duration, 2 hours is no where near enough to tell the story as it was told in the book. Where was the Epic car chases? Where was the telepathy? Where were such vital characters as Perlmutter, and of course Freddy? Where were the flashbacks to their past? All of these and many other elements of the story that were just "skipped out" lead to its overall failure.I think the whole idea to adapt the novel into a Movie was a mistake to begin with. A single season TV series would have been more just. Simply put, too many things from the novel were cut out (And some changed) for the story to remain gripping, appealing and thrilling.</fullReview>

When reading the book, one gets the feeling of massive entertainment(as from King we expect), while watching this so called 'film' I just felt suffering. Not only because more than the two third of the story was missing and acting is non existing, but, it may sound funny to say about a two hour long movie, somehow it's too fast. It's nearly gibberish. Characters not coming to life, no feeling of thoughtfulness. Can't understand the motives and the thoughts behind the actions, events. I, seriously felt, people are doing these things, just because it was written in the book. Sadly, if you haven't read the book, you will be just gasping.</fullReview>

This proves that although a sci-fi movie has cool special effects, and a high budget, can still be worse than low-budget movies (like Cry_Wolf, which turned out to be one of my favorite movies) I first rented it because I thought the cast was pretty good. Thomas Jane, Morgan Freeman, Timothy Olymphant are pretty good actors in my opinion. Their performance wasn't exactly disappointing, but the weak script made it impossible for them to do their best.The aliens were extremely gross. The way they come out of humans, is sort of how the aliens come out in Alien and how the dinosaurs do in Carnosaur; they just took the other single alternative.In conclusion, stay far away from this movie.

		<shortDescription>A sad adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher begins as a very faithful adaptation of a very interesting book. Sadly, this is a very complex book, and two hours would never be able to portray the whole spectrum this book deals with. Subsequently, relationships are left unexplored, key events are either not explained or completely omitted, characters are left undeveloped, motivations are left unexplained, and you see certain story gaps in the movie progressing that leave you wondering what happened, or why are the characters behaving that way.This I could forgive. Perhaps the time limit really made this story suffer. Perhaps the inevitable "Special Edition Director's Cut DVD" would fully flesh the characters, motivations, and events. King puts a lot of work in his characters and their motivations, so his books are rarely done justice when adapted into movies. They always wound up better when adapted into miniseries.What I cannot forgive is the fact that, at certain point in the story, the director apparently just said "To hell with it!" and started taking liberties with the story. By the end, the story got butchered and reassembled into something that had very little resemblance to the original book, to the point of having an almost completely different ending. And it was a pretty bad, absurd ending.Read the book instead. It's far better than this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I accidentally get trapped into renting movies of such low caliber, I'm reminded of one good rule of thumb: don't rent a film based on its preview alone. I'm a huge Stephen King fan and most of the movies made from his books are pretty good. But this has to be one of the worst adaptations, and worst movies with a budget ever made. This movie does grab your attention right away and you become intrigued, even a little frightened. But when an alien becomes trapped in a toilet, you should know where the film is going from this point on and stop watching, which I failed to do. Its so hard to believe that great actors like Tom Sizemore and Morgan Freeman would ever agree to play roles in such crap films! I think you could hear the sounds of their ex-agents shuffling newspapers on the sidewalk in LA as they looked through the want-ads after the Dream Catcher premier.This movie had so much comical crap: a slug-like alien that is about as scary as an over-sized old puppet from a 50's horror movie, Tom Sizemore taking on a helicopter with a hand gun, a strange alien kid named Duddits??? What kind of a f&amp;$%ing name is Duddits? Why not name the kid Stupids for crying out loud? It would have the same effect. Morgan Freeman shooting his soldiers to make a point, Jonesy hiding his personal secrets in his mind. I couldn't believe the movie creators felt the need to show a grown man hurrying around in his imaginary mind, moving around filing cabinets to keep from an alien appropriately named Mr. Grey, who of course speaks through the human by morphing into his body and speaking like a sinister British villain ????????? And my favorite scene of the whole movie was how one psychic friend communicates with his other psychic friend by talking into the barrel of a hand gun. "How are we going to communicate with him." "I have an idea, give me your gun." "Ok" (hands over gun willingly) (man puts gun to his head as if it were a phone) "Hello? . . . It's Jonesy! Where are you? Okay, we'll be right there." Seriously, if I was in the CIA, driving around a man claiming to be psychic, who asked me for my gun, and then proceeded to put it against his head and act like he was having a conversation through it, I would either throw him out of the car or do the world a favor and shoot him. What's even more hard to believe is that the same guy who wrote such classics as All the President's Men, Butch and Sundance, and the Princess Bride could write such a terrible screenplay. If you still want to rent this after reading my spiel, then I would suggest watching the first 20 minutes, then fast forwarding to anything that looks funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Again, King is mistreated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my comment about "The Green Mile", I've said that King's novels received mixed treatment from Hollywood. Some average books generated classic movies, and some classic novels collapsed into poor film adaptations. "Dreamcatcher" belongs to the last category. The book, though starts off very slowly, attains its pace in the middle and in the end becomes one of the best King's ever written, much like his earlier works. But the movie starts off fast, ruins everything in the middle and in the end becomes a mess that nobody can understand if not read the novel.I think the main problem is that the novel is too long to fit into a 2-hr movie. But there lies the director/screenwriter's job. And Kasdan failed miserably. The movie's filled with unnecessary shots which cut short the main theme e.g. the friends having a chat about films in their first night at Derry. There are too many questions to be answered in this story and so in the end came the rush and they couldn't get anything right.Jason Lee, however, is awesome. I really didn't expect this treatment from him after his typecast roles in Almost Famous, Chasing Amy or Vanilla Sky. Thomas Jane gives a bland and disappointing performance as Henry, I would prefer at least Keanu Reeves for that role. Otherwise the casting was perfect with Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore. The story really could make a great film in the hands of good directors. Surely Kasdan isn't one of them.</fullReview>

The only thing that the movie explained was the connection between all the characters with the dream catcher. Morgan Freemans character in the book had blond hair, blue eyes, and his name was Kurtz, if that was his real name. It was thought that he had taken his name from Apocalypse Now. When he would the helicopters into battle, his "theme" song was Sympathy For The Devil. I like Morgan Freeman as an actor, but I just can't see him as a bad man or villain. There are only 2 things they could have done to save this movie. The first would be to make it a 2 or 3 parter to get all the details. The second would be to to realize what a bad story this is and forget about making a movie all together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As horror stories go, Stephen King has written some corkers in his time, but for every corker there's a handful of disappointments, this, unfortunately, being one of the latter.Dreamcatcher tells of four childhood friends, now leading very different lives, who reunite once a year to spend a weekend in a log cabin in the woods. When, in their youth, they saved a disabled child from a gang of bullies, the disabled child rewards them with a gift, an unspoken telepathy and ability to predict some future happenings. Twenty years on they have united for another weekend in seclusion, but find themselves with some unwanted extra-terrestrial visitors, hotly pursued by a gung-ho military commander.Firstly, the movie looks eerily beautiful, mostly set in snow covered woodland, at once comforting and haunting. The special effects are mostly quite good, but verge occasionally on the cartoonish. Largely, a very stylish movie, which seems to be the norm for all these Stephen King adaptations that are sadly lacking in actual content.Unfortunately, that is where the praise ends. A good cast do their best with a hokey script, but most of the players are either horribly miscast or underused. Damian Lewis, excellent throughout TV's Band of Brothers, struggles with his characters schizophrenic episode which seemingly comes out of nowhere, with little or no explanation, while Morgan Freeman uttering the line, "Those poor schmucks... they drive Chevrolets, shop at Wal-Mart, never miss an episode of Friends. These are Americans.", is only made all the more laughable by his ridiculous hair. The plot advances on a line all of it's own, never sure whether or not to provide an explanation for some of the more far-reaching plot devices (Jason Lee and his toothpicks? Come on!). With half an hour to go I found myself nodding off (although it was 6am) and when the end did come it was wholly unsatisfying.Having not read the book, but having been told that a lot had been left out of the film, I can't help but feel perhaps this would have worked better as a mini-series/2-part TV movie. Not worth going out of your way for, but if it's on TV and there's nothing else to do, you might as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***MAY CONTAIN SMALL SPOILERS*** A ridiculous movie made from a just-as-bad Stephen King novel. Why do Hollywood producers and directors feel the need to make a film out of everything both Stephen King and John Grisham write(although most of Grisham's are efficient enough). Did they even read the book or script. Four friends go out to a forest on holiday in a log cabin. But, surprise, surprise an alien ship has landed there with large worm-like creatures and other stupid skinny monsters who are out to destroy the earth. One alien takes over one our friends' "memory warehouse" - a literal physical place made of matter that only exists in his mind and he battles his enemy for innermost secret contents of his mind!!?? - another alien who is about eight feet tall and two inches wide stands and stares and another worm tries to kill everyone gets thwarted by our friends' childhood gifted freak-child friend Duditz whom they collect at the end just in time before he mutates into a lion monster and slays their nemesis in an incoherent, inarticulate swirling climax of nonsense and ridicule and cinema filth that leaves you asking the unanswerable - why?. Morgann Freeman appears as a CIA or FBI or MIB agent and tries to keep a lid on all this alien activity in the worst role of his career.I only gave it one star because they wouldn't let me give it zero or below.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dreamcatcher" (2003) is a nth adaptation of a Stephen King novel and it wasn't an easy job since the novel was voluminous (700 pages). It explains why the movie lasts so long: 2 hours and a quarter. I personally didn't read the novel (besides, I have never been a fan of Stephen King) but basically, I thought that there was a beautiful title with dreamlike connotations. I thought that it was a fantastic movie that Lawrence Kasdan had concocted. It is true in the first fifty/fifty-five minutes of the film. Here's the beginning of the story: 4 children who one day manage to save a child from a gang of ruffians. To thank them, this weird boy makes a present of telepathic powers to them. So, they can sense what other people think of and they can also guess the future. Years later, these children have become grown-ups and are in the habit of spending the week-end in a chalet in an isolated forest. But, one day, strange phenomena happen: Beaver and Henry help an old man who has a strange appearance: he's farting all the time and his belly keeps on growing. Moreover, they see all animals in the forest running in the same direction as if they tried to escape something dangerous and they have a red mark in their fur. The two other friends, Pete and Jonesy meet an old lady who presents the same symptoms as the old man. To come back to Beaver and Henry, Beaver is killed by a sort of moray and what Henry sees leaves him petrified: a gigantic extraterrestrial. Then, the camera takes us in a desert place where we see the leaders of an American army busy themselves to try to repel an extraterrestrial invasion.It is from this moment that we realize the real identity of the film and we enter the heart of the topic: it is an extra-terrestrial invasion! One again. The title of the film is a delusion and reveals a threadbare topic. But as the key-sentence of "the Matrix Revolutions" (2003) lets suggest: everything that has a beginning has an end. So, the movie must end and there's nothing to expect from a movie whose progression is more than predictable. On the one hand, we see the American army trying to repel the aliens, on the other hand, the movie doesn't try to forget the adventures of the three main characters of the beginning of the film (Beaver, in the meantime, is dead by the moray). This situation lasts until the two parts meet each other. In the end, "Dreamcatcher" suffers from a hateful gap between the two parts that the movie follows and it interferes with the development of the story. The whole gives a lame movie straddled between fantastic and science-fiction and whose efforts to keep as much as possible a unity are as vain as useless. Moreover, the tension falls down, the interest weakens. You only want one thing: to switch off.The screenplay is as delicious as a Swiss Emmenthal: it contains huge holes and everything harmful that can happen to a good screenplay: jerry-built moments (the sequence in the toilets), lack of deepness of the characters (beginning with Duddits), ambiguous points which remain unexplained and it isn't a lowbrow humor and movie-loving details (Morgan Freeman has a gun which belonged to John Wayne, the disease transmitted by the aliens is called Ripley, the name of the heroine in the Alien saga) which can compensate the enormous weaknesses of the film. Another remark: in the scenes supposed to be scary, you only want to laugh.In the middle of this distressing convention, emerges a little and unexpected originality: a presumptuous Morgan Freeman teams up with an impressed Tom Sizemore and however, we could expect to see the contrary. Roughly, they have inverted their respective roles. But it doesn't help the movie to find its landmarks. Be that as it may, if I sum up the movie you have understood it: the title of the film is dreamy and reveals a nightmarish truth. It's no-use to move to watch this film unless you are fond of extraterrestrial invasions. Passion is blind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, such a horrible movie that had some potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher is another lame version of a Stephen King movie. The novel was great, and the movie does follow the book as closely as possible. The acting in the movie is really good, the best performance is from Morgan Freeman. The creatures are awesome, and there is one scene that is scary and well made. The cinematography is really well done, and the director's vision of certain elements of the story are really cool. That is everything good about the movie, the rest is a bunch of crap. The plot is very confusing and hard to follow, many things are lame, and some things are just plain weird. When I say weird, I mean weird in a bad and unwatchable way.It's a shame that the novel never really made its way to being a good adaptation. At least the effects, the cinematography, and the one scene about 45 minutes into the movie are all high points. Not worth your time, but at least it's better than some other Stephen King flops.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah yes, another Stephen King movie that's about as original as a sequel. I didn't completely hate this movie, though I hated it more then I liked it. I'm usually a huge sci-fi fan, but I didn't realize that it was going to basically be a retelling of another great movie... The Thing. However, this is not the only source that Stephen has borrowed from in order to rip us off, yet again. Night of the Creeps, Nightbreed, The Thing, all have a similar aspect to them, creatures that either take your form, or control your mind. It's already been done, and been done better at that. I personally feel that King has run out of good "horror" type stories to tell. He should stick to making stories such as Shawshank, Green Mile, and Stand by Me. This move is just the same thing over and over again. If you haven't seen any of the before mentioned movies, you may just like this, but see any of the other movies and you'll find yourself being disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm no huge fan of Stephen King, however his books are rarely a complete waste of time. While his ideas have mostly lost their vigor the last few years he can still crank out some decent reading once in a while. Dreamcatcher is that "once in a while". Which makes this even more disturbing, since it seems almost impossible to make a successful film out of a Stephen King novel. Even when he provides solid material.Dreamcatcher has many of the classic Stephen King elements. Male bonding, childhood friends working together to overcome present-day problems, special people having special gifts. Also the book is overly long which is a problem shared by many Stephen King novels, probably the reason why many of the mini-series made from his work are more successful than the full-length movies. This also affects the films in a negative way since it's hard to cram 700 closely written pages into a little over two hours of film.The book is quite clearly divided between past and present. The movie focuses almost solely on present. This makes many of the events and actions taken by the characters hard to comprehend. Technically (sound and picture quality) the movie is well made, with over-average special effects. But that doesn't really help when the story lacks coherence and you first and foremost lack the perspective you need to understand what Stephen King wanted to say with his story. What was a rather warm story about friendship becomes a sci-fi action film with little or no feelings involved whatsoever. Also the comic relief thrown in here and there brighten the mood, but doesn't really fit well into the overall mood. The actors do their best though, and if it wasn't for the actors this could have been a whole lot worse than it already is.So, i'm still waiting for someone to make a decent film from one of Stephen Kings horror novels. The only movies made from his written work that are truly well made so far are "The Shawshank Redemption" and "The Green Mile", none of which are standard Stephen King-fare. Kubrick's "The Shining" is certainly competently made, but King apparently doesn't like it. So i'm still waiting for someone to try again, to please both the audience and the writer. This mess is not even close and i rate it 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why can't they do it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll first say that I'm a HUGE Stephen King fan. I think it's probably impossible for me to dislike any of his work or adaptions.There are a few things I find odd. The first is why people that haven't read the books even bother with the movies. The books are ALWAYS better, so I'm not really sure what goes through their minds, or why they tend to think the book is bad just because a movie fails to convey the meaning properly.Dreamcatcher is one of these experiences. If you've read the book and enjoyed it, you'll like the movie--until the end at least. I'm going to avoid spoilers, but if you want to be totally surprised, skip the rest of this paragraph. The end strayed too far from the book in several ways. I think it was mostly because of a need to end with a bang.The other thing I find odd is that people that don't like Stephen King still watch the movies as if they're going to like them. If the book is always better (and it is), then why on Earth would you dislike the book and enjoy the movie?Dreamcatcher also seems to attract these people. They watch the movie, even after not liking the book, and are surprised that they don't like it. Well...duh.Now, my own opinions. I loved the book. I may be in the minority on this one, but I thought it was great (not one of SK's best, but still good). The movie...well...the movie was somewhat close to the book, but with a few changes, until the end, where the movie completely goes the other direction.That, I think, was the only major complaint.Why is it that with Stephen King adaptions, the endings tend to always be...off?</fullReview>

Why does Tom Sizemor believe everything the hero says? Why has Morgan Freeman gone ape****.? How can a suicidal psychologist turn into Rambo? Whats with that house? Why do we suddenly have to care about a missing girl? What's a F___aroo? Why does the house turn into red dust? Who are the aliens? Hey how'd Jonesy make it out of that mess. No one coulda survived that accident. Look at what happened to Brad Pitt in Meet Joe Black. This one was just as bad.Yep, those are the questions I'm left with. Perhaps it's a ploy to get me to read another King book.The so called original ending was probably pulled because it made no sense whatsoever. And had a horribly weak ending. It also made Duddits completely worthless. That original ending should have never made it to the lens of the camera.I'd probably say skip the first 50 minutes. Except that then I'd have even more questions. So can I scream at the director now?4/10Quality: 2/10 Entertainment: 8/10 Replayable: 4/10</fullReview>

Four childhood friends who all possess minor psychic ability get together for a weekend at their cabin and remember their friend Duddits, a mentally disabled man whom they helped in their adolescence.However, the film, script, and acting all go awry when Morgan Freeman shows up, a patriotic alien hunter who is focused on stopping a horrible rash outbreak that results in extensive burping, farting, bloating. Ultimately, large Tremors-like aliens blast out of their rashy hosts' rectum.The film unsuccessfully tries to be a serious film while having an alien try to bite off Timothy Olyphant's manhood and a scene in which Jason Lee wrestles a toilet seat containing one of the extraterrestrial butt-dwellers.This film's downfall is that it truly would have been four or five great films, but the producers took a good novel and mucked it up into being an attempted array of pompous, feel-good turd jokes.2 out of 5.</fullReview>

About an hour passes before top-billed Freeman makes his first appearance, while we get to know the four friends whom could have had a whole movie made around them (as opposed to the sci-fi 360 the movie pulls on its viewers).

Excellent special effects that are balanced to give the 'horror' aspect its story line without detracting from the plot. Good acting - very convincing (given the nature of plot). Originallity in the implementation of classic good vs evil intentions (creature talents and how they use them).Prior to viewing (as always) I reviewed the IMDB rating and expected very little. Most likey a movie to turn off after 'just enough' pain. The poor ratings is what prompted me to write a rare comment on what I thought was a really good flick.Being a work of fiction I can allow the primary themes of aliens, goverment intervention teams and 'regular people' plenty of room to breath (i.e. stray from credibility) as long the whole mix is believeable enough the kill a couple of hours with something interesting.I summation I was suprized at the low ratings enough to comment on the flick.

		<fullReview>Your answer to the above poser may well have a bearing on what you get out of the movie, if anything at all; as will whether you actually liked the Stephen King novel that is the source material. Personally, I didn't. I found it to be one of the most flabby and rehashed works of his writing career, written at a time when he was presumably 'doped' up and reading just as confusedly with every page. Given that I didn't particularly care for the book, though, I asked myself the same question I've put to you - the reader - while I watched...On balance I'd say that the filmic experience just edges it in terms of enjoyment. Lord knows transferring a work as garbled as this to the big screen must have been a challenge, and those involved gave it a brave, but futile attempt. It's pretty faithful except in regard to the ending, which opted for the 'splatterhouse' climax over the more restrained and appropriate version to be found on the DVD. This in mind, perhaps it's obvious that my reaction as I came away was scathing, but one or two sequences are well-handled - constructed and shot as they should be. The ultimate credit must lie with King, however, for the fact that they are present at all. May I also say that a couple of nice touches in a 2hr+ movie isn't enough.The cast is a veritable mixed bag, with Freeman being a standout as always. A pity then, that he's saddled with a character who feels like an unnecessary recipe ingredient in both the movie and the novel! Bringing "Dreamcatcher" to the screen was a mistake, just as writing it in the first place was. A mostly loyal adaptation of a poor novel. What does that make?A poor movie. Given the materials they had to work with, though, it should offer some consolation and credit to the team that what they've managed to salvage from the wreckage is something like an honourable failure. If you're still itching to make an eerie picture with a suitably foreboding build-up, boys and girls - next time tread more carefully and select a better inspiration; because this enterprise didn't really have a hope from the second it was greenlit.</fullReview>

Anyway, if you're not afraid of anally giving birth to aliens now, you will be after you see Dreamcatcher. You will also, invariably, be afraid of Morgan Freeman.This is like a made-for-TV movie, only they swear. It has the bad actingcharacteristic of so many Stephen King adaptations, and then throws on the big budget thrills of CGI aliens and helicopter what-have-you. Watch for a golden scene where Jason Lee acts opposite a computer-generated lamprey.

Nearly all of themsaid, "Yeah, I'll go see it in the theater because it has Morgan Freeman." People, I applaud your taste, but your deception is lamentable.What the film really needs is a voiceover by Freeman at the end, saying, "I like to think the last thing that went through that alien's head -- other than that bullet -- was to wonder how the HELL he got talked into acting in this smoking-chunk-of- crud movie.

		<fullReview>My goodness, what a MESS of a movie! I've seen loads and loads of movies but I honestly think that this is the worst one I've EVER seen!!! I really wanted to like this film, I didn't see it in the theater so I was pleased to find it on sale. Actually, they should of paid me to take it. Since I'm required, by IMDb, to provide at least 10 lines of comments I'll have to go into a little more detail on WHY this THING was so bad. Is it scary? NO! Is the screenplay engaging? Nope!! Is there any even remotely redeeming aspect to this film? NONE whatsoever!!! Considering that Morgan Freeman and Damian Lewis are in it I THOUGHT that it would be good. Morgan was phenomenal in "Shawshank" and Damian was flawless in "Band of Brothers". Unfortunately, the script was SO bad that they couldn't even come close to saving this crapola of a film. Please don't rent, borrow or buy this. If you do you'll be sorry, BELIEVE ME!!!!!</fullReview>

What a stupid premise. I expected horror or suspense at least good acting. This was so badly below the belt, it was laugh out loud bad in a big way.I couldn't believe my eyes. I expect so much more from the pioneers of great cinema. What a KIngsize Stink of a film. Not bad but bloody unwatchable. Aliens coming out of the toilet. Give me a break</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it seems that there are some King movies that those who read his books hate and those who don't read them love. The Shining would be a good example.And then there are those that the book-readers love. In many cases, unless you've read the book they make little sense. This movie is the latter type. It's sort of like "Highlights from Hamlet." You are expected to be familiar with the original material. Some great scenes -- the running animals are amazing. But if you don't know the plot -- you won't have much of an idea after the movie either.Bottom line -- only King fans need apply.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the hell went wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dreamcatcher" starts out with an interesting premise. There are four guys who have been friends since childhood. They all have some sort of psychic ability. Its unclear exactly what their ability is, and what the significance is, but this mysteriousness makes the movie more intriguing. As the story builds, the mysteriousness continues to grow. Kasdan does a great job in building suspense during this part of the movie, as I found myself really curious in trying to figure out what was going to happen next.****SPOILER ALERT****Anyway, out of nowhere, stupidity starts to run amok. More crap happens where there are alien snake things. Then all of a sudden the movie ends when the head alien fights with a friend of the main characters, who also happens to be an alien. Both aliens explode. The end.I found myself wondering what the hell went wrong. The movie started out awesome, but then it turned into an alien movie with no motivation. I would go as far as to say that this is one of the worst movies of 2003. I would recommend that you watch the first hour of the movie, and then shut it off. Watching the entire movie will only make you feel disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stephen King, I want my money back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two names that appear within the credits at the beginning of Dreamcatcher that should seem as familiar to you as your favorite spring jacket. What might surprise you is that the second name should mean a lot more than the first.The two names in question are that of author Stephen King and director Lawrence Kasdan. Now, unless you have been hiding in an Afghanistan cave the past 25 years, you will know Stephen King. Author of such novels as Carrie, Salem's Lot &amp; Pet Cemetary, no less than 30 of his books or characters have graced the big screen. Kasdan, on the other hand, might be a bit more aloof. He was the writer of such bonanza's Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Empire Strikes Back. As a director, he has provided us with some incredible performance driven films over the years with The Big Chill, Body Heat, The Accidental Tourist and Grand Canyon.So when the two teamed together for the adaptation of King's novel Dreamcatcher, I was giddy. For lets face it, King movies have taken a turn for the better in previous years with The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile leading the hit parade. Add to the mix that Morgan Freeman (also of Shawshank) leading the acting charge, and the giddiness turned to childlike anticipation. But, by the time the movie's end credits were rolling in front of the audience, I knew this title was going in my worst of 2003 list.Dreamcatcher is the story of a group of four friends who get together for their annual northern retreat. These are not your average folk mind you. A youthful experience with a 'special' neighbor has left them all with special gifts a la King style. Whether they're reading each others minds or shooting things from their fingertips, these guys would freak out even David Blaine.So now that we have the characters, we await Mr. King's evil, and in Dreamcatcher, it comes in the form of an alien that gives you gas and eventually explodes out your butt. Let me say that again in case you didn't pick it up the first time. In Dreamcather, it comes in the form of an alien that gives you gas and eventually explodes out your butt. Yup. Twice said and no better understood.When the first poo-monster is unleashed from a strangers bottom, it leaves one of the four dead and another possessed with a persona known to us as Mr. Grey. Mr. Grey then takes his new human shell and tries to travel to the nearest city with the bad intentions of infecting our drinking water.Erstwhile, the remaining two of the group were on route back from the local store when an accident leaves them stranded. One tries to go for help, while the other tends to a woman found on the road, who too will have her butt erupt and a fight with a second poo-monster ensues.Then there is the troops commanded by Freeman who try to rid the worl..you know what? I can't do it. Rehashing the plot means having the relive this movie again in my head, and I just cannot spare more time with this foolish, misguided effort.Dreamcathers is a bad movie. There is no getting around it. Stephen King wrote the novel while recovering from his horrific car accident and it shows. The most famous living author in America circa 2004 and the best he can come up with is a monster that escapes from your ass? I think the IV drip was on an extra dose that week.But let me not point just one finger towards the writer, for there is plenty of blame to go around. Lawrence Kasdan takes a big chunk of my ire. What quality was possessed within the confines of this script that would have him want to jump from his usual character driven films to a horror where rectums are destroyed in the pursuit of world dominance? I usually look forward to your films Mr. Kasdan, but you have betrayed me, and you now owe me $13!It would be easy now to fault the actors for taking the role, but I am going to stop just short of barbequing the entire studio. I will admit that if I was Thomas Jane or Damian Lewis, I too might be swayed by the sheer notion of the writer and director involved with the production. Donnie Wahlberg tries to emulate Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot but comes across more as a Sean Penn via I Am Sam. And Donnie, you are no Sean Penn. The two I can't forgive however are Freeman and Tom Seizmore. Both have been around the block and should know better, so they don't get the mercy like someone who needed the paycheck.There is so much more to say, but this movie doesn't deserve my efforts. From the uninspired aliens through the embarrassment of a retarded child being the earth's savior, this film is pooy! Which, I guess makes perfect sense then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor adaptation of a mediocre King novel....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie stinks as bad as a s***-weasel.As a novelist, King has really been scrabbling to hold on to his crown (pun intended) of "Most Popular Horror Novelist." Unfortunately, his recent work (excepting "Hearts in Atlantis") has been excruciating. It has been derivative and hackneyed, totally lacking in imagination and the rich detail that characterized his earlier work. Part of the magic of his great early novels was that the plot developments and characterizations were seamless interwoven. There was some subtlety...and that is what ultimately made the novels so terrifying."Dreamcatcher" (the novel) stole from many sources and I won't bother going into them here. But, rest assured, "Dreamcatcher" (the movie) gets obediently in line and follows the same strategy. To rephrase an old cliche, "The good parts are not original and the original parts are not good."Finally, this movie commits the one unforgivable cinematic sin: it says nothing of importance and, what's worse, it is boring. I mean VERY boring. There were a few scenes that drew my interest for a moment or two (for example, the animals inexplicably fleeing the forest) but these could not make the whole movie worth watching.I suggest you go rent the original "The Dead Zone" instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No redeeming features. Horrible script, bad acting, no tension, no suspense, no believable characters - not even the first part of the film is that great (far too obvious and unsuspenseful). The special effects are okay but the creature design is far from impressive or scary. And people farting on screen is not scary, even if those farts are caused by two-foot long alien tadpoles with more teeth than they know what to do with. Writer William Goldman proves that his law of Hollywood (nobody knows anything)applies to himself as well. It's like an episode of South Park without the intentional laughs (but a truckload of unintentional ones). Everyone involved with this (including Stephen King) should be extremely ashamed of themselves.</fullReview>

Did they cut to another movie?! I was totally taken aback by the crap that went on as soon as the monsters started appearing. I wouldn't have hated this movie as much if the monsters were there from the beginning. Show crap to be crap. Don't mask it with the first half hour or so of amazing storytelling and character development, getting my hopes up, and then damning the story to hell at the end of it.Save 2 hours of your life.

		<shortDescription>KING'S LOST IT.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the only work of Stephen King that I actually enjoyed was The Shining. Apparently, King crammed all the ideas of his previous novels into this steaming pile of dung. We had the "red fungus" which reminded me of the green plant growth from creepshow. The group of friends who all share some trauma as kids, and grow up and meet together every 20 years or so. Remember IT? Telethapy, from The Shining also rings a bell. Ive never seen a movie go in so many directions and end up nowhere, but Dreamcatcher does just that. The biggest thing that I didn't like about this movie was how it was written. They went great lengths to make visual and audible clues to the storyline, that were not needed, not to mention incredibly cheesy. I know books are written a different grade levels. This movie would be like at a 4th grade level. I do have some questions, Why does the alien talk with a poor British accent? If these friends are so telepathic, why would one have to answer a, and Im not making this up, a ringing gun...then talk trough it like it was a telephone!! Morgan Freeman, Jason Lee, and Tom Sizemore, what on earth were you thinking? Boys, I would be firing your agent. Of course this is just my opion...It may be wrong</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This must be the worst piece of garbage I have seen for a very long time. Putting it in the context of a Stephen king production it becomes even worse as he usually writes qualitative books which have generated movies worth paying time to watch, for instance the Green Mile. As I havn't read the book I don't know if I should blame king or the director. However; I strongly advise you to avoid this movie.Reasons to my opinion ?- The whole idea with alies invading tends to be rather overused and out of fashion. - Of course the director could not do much about that but one can expect him to make the movie engaging and frightening. - It is filled with cliches and nothing new in content.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is Morgan Freeman doing in this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd say 'spoilers ahead' but there isn't much to spoil about this movie, really. It falls neatly into the 'it makes no sense' category. Ridiculing it is a facile and pointless excercise. Just recapitulating the story is enough. Here it goes.An alien race, advanced enough to master interplanetary space-travel, is poised to invade our planet. Their ultimate goal is to destroy humans by infecting them with a parasite which multiplies either by eggs or by spores. For reasons left unexplained, the aliens choose not to carry out the plan in an obvious way, for example by dumping the infectious spores over a populous city. Instead, they land the mothership in the remotest corner of Maine and infect forest animals and the few inhabitants of the area. Alas, they also alert a special paramilitary force who almost successfully rounds up all infected people in a camp and wipes out the landed alien party using helicopter gunships.Only one alien, camouflaged inside the body of a human he posseses, escapes the area. He is lucky enough to be picked up on some highway, in the middle of the night, by a truck carrying both dead infected animals and a live dog. He feeds the dead animals to the dog to obtain a mature parasite. Then he heads for Boston's water reservoir to dump the parasite there. He is stopped, at the last second, by a group of three people: a rebelious officer of the paramilitary force, a friend of the possessed with psychic powers, and another friend with even bigger psychic powers who is both retarded and suffering of terminal leukemia. The retarded friend turns out to be also actually an alien. In the supposedly climactic scene, the bad alien and the good alien leave their avatars and fight to mutual destruction using only their teeth, claws and spiky tails. The parasite is killed using a machine gun, and a little toad it gives birth to as it dies is squished just as it's about to jump into the water reservoir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of the movies I've seen in 2003, this is definately the worst.Here are some serious problems with the film.Some minor spoilers here!1.Why are all the animals running together? Instead of animals fleeing from random areas in the forest, we see cougars, deer and rabbits all running together in a herd right past the front of the cabin in the woods. Now I'm not going to explain why that doesn't make any sense, I'm sure you can figure that out. 2.The little worm-like CG alien looks like something straight out of a saturday morning cartoon. 3.DUDITZ the mentally challenged guy with cancer who is actually a very health alien. 4. The entire scene with the protagonist and Tom Sizemore in the pickup truck. Wait let me read my friends minds, a power I just instantly realized that I had! Oh no! It's not my friend, it's the alien inside my friend with a a cheesy british accent also from a saturday morning cartoon.Need I continue.....Why Morgan Freeman, Tom Sizemore and Jason Lee agreed to take parts in this movie is beyond me.Trust me and dont' waste your time on this one. 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is ample evidence that Stephen King's novels are goldmines for Screenwriters who create wonderfully complex screenplays with captivating and meaningful dialog. You only have to look as far as Misery, The Shining, The Green Mile where very good actors were given a chance to develop their characters on screen without sacrficing the excitment of a plot twists or the suspense of the unknown.Dreamcatcher, however, made no such attempt. And I place the blame sqaurely on the shoulders of the screenwriter and the director. This movie had almost no story development, no character development and perhaps the worst dialog I have seen in quite sometime. Afterall, if you can make Morgan Freeman (with whose work everyone is familiar) and Damien Lewis (whose range can hardly be denied from Band of Brothers to The Forsythe Saga) look totally ridiculous, you've created something monumentally BAD!One question though - Do all aliens take High Tea at 4:00? Perhaps the BBC should look into special programming for a new demographic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another King Book Fails on the Big Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The next in the long line of Stephen King novels to be adapted into a movie. The biggest trouble with doing this is that the novel was sizable and any attempt to translate it onto the big screen will be hard pressed from the get-go. Secondly, the book had a lot of necessary detail and background that cannot be put into the film without adding 3-4 hours to the running time. Many things are sped up in order to keep running time down. This sets the pace at break-neck speed and often times leaves people in the dust. It was very frustrating trying to read or see things that were obviously labeled and meant to be seen and understood, but was on screen for such a short time that there was no was to take it in in time. Now, I obviously read the book first, and only by doing so do I think that I was able to follow the plot. I imagine that anybody not acquainted with the story already would have a difficult time following along and understanding some things.Another problem with the movie is the lack of closure. At the end, I was saying "and what about (fill in the blank)" There was a lot left unfinished and a lot of questions unansweredThe only things that I enjoyed about this movie was the excellent cast and a few camera techniques. I usually hate directors using a fast switch, shake the camera shot that is usually employed only to try to add tension. It usually only gives me a headache, but this is the first time that I've seen these techniques used properly to help make the transition from Jonsey to Mr. Grey.Over all, this film comes up far short of what it could have been. The potential as there but I don't think it was possible to do a decent job without extending the movie considerably to try to properly tell the tale. If you can't do something right, don't do it all all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sat through this interminable mess and felt angry at having had 134 minutes of my life taken away! I didn't just hate this film, it made me seethe!It baffles the mind that millions were spent on this thoroughly moronic exercise while worthwhile films can't find backing. Hell, I'd prefer they'd used the money for a big screen version of "Saved By The Bell"...it certainly couldn't be any more brain-dead or badly acted than this pretentious, overwritten mess.I think this film has done it for me and Mr. Stephen King. He's a self- referencing hack as far as I'm concerned and needs to grow up and stop rehashing his geek childhood. There are a great many things frightening to the adult mind, but Mr. King can't seem to get boogey men and monsters out of his system.As far as film adaptations of his books, I couldn't bear to see yet another group of doofus childhood buds yakking it up and saying cute and crude things while they call each other by their thoroughly asinine nicknames. HELP!I was expecting a thriller, a horror film or a science fiction film; I didn't get any of those. What I got was a cast of leads so annoying that you actually pray for violent and gory deaths for them all (especially Jason Lee). I got acting so bad that when a lifelong pal is killed, the "actors" muster up the same level of loss one sees when someone finds that their Sunday paper has been rained on. Truly, the actors in this movie are so bland that even in the face of horrific alien monsters, their marble-eyed, blank faces just barely register surprise when we should be seeing alarm and terror.This is one of those movies where no matter what the dullard hero (Thomas Jane)has been through, his hair always remains matinee idol perfect.Oh, how I hated this film! I wanted to kick my TV screen when the characters broke into a rendition of "Blue Bayou." I ran for the fast forward button when I heard just one too many fart jokes. Lord! What level of Hell released this film? I can't remember having such a strong dislike for a movie. It seemed like a personal affront!Dreamcatcher is EL CRAPOLA to the 10th power. It amazes me that this thing is on DVD and "Day of the Locust" and "3 Women" aren't!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So, so dissapointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having missed this at the cinema, and being a big fan of most Stephen King stories, I was really looking forward to getting the DVD. It had some normally excellent actors in it; Morgan Freeman, Tom Sizemore and Thomas Jane and the trailer had looked promising.But, it was simply awful and so disappointing! I can only blame the director, Lawrence Kasdan, for this disjointed mess. Having started fairly promisingly, with an introduction to each character, it then rapidly degenerated into a poor excuse for a 'B' movie with a 'monster' that takes refuge up its victims backside, before exploding out in an explosion of blood.The dialog was appalling and I am surprised the actors themselves were prepared to utter, some truly awful and clichéd phrases. I can only assume they never got to see how it all fitted together - because it didn't.Don't waste your time, or money, on this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Year's Most Star-Studded Flop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise for Dreamcatcher, Lawrence Kasdan's adaptation of the best-selling novel of the same name by Stephen King, is simple enough. But, by the time this movie blessedly ends, an alien possession, a childhood pact with an autistic boy, and a psychotic Army colonel will twist and turn and beat this plot to death as this King-Kasdan collaboration turns into the most star-studded flop of the spring.Pete, Henry, Jonesy, and Beaver are four ordinary, almost excruciatingly witty guys who lead mostly ordinary lives, but who are blessed with a kind of ESP. Pete (Timothy Olyphant) is a car salesman with a knack for finding lost objects, Henry (Thomas Jane) is a psychiatrist, near suicidal with guilt over his humiliation of an overweight patient who eventually killed himself, and Jonesy (British actor Damian Lewis) is a professor at a New England university who can read minds without even trying.It is never really established what Beaver (the solid Jason Lee) does for a living, but his gift is quite similar to that of Jonesy. The four were given these gifts by an extraordinary local autistic (Donnie Wahlberg), whom they saved from a bullying attack when they were all just boys. In spite of their powers, the four today live mostly unhappy and unfulfilled lives.Their only solace appears to be their annual trip into the woods to drink, hunt, and relive their youth with their best friends in the world. But when a mysterious stranger wanders into camp with what looks like radiation burns on much of his body and a lapsed memory, they find themselves at odds with a murderous alien force that will threaten all of their lives.Two of their party wind up quickly and almost casually dead, while Jonesy is taken possession of and the alien within him (which calls itself Mr. Gray and speaks in the ridiculous accent of a British gentleman) will try to evade a mad military man (a disinterested Morgan Freeman) and infect the rest of the world's population before Henry and the dying autistic can unlock the secret of the mutual destiny that they all share with this creature.The problem with this movie is its effort to do way too much. The trailer suggests that this movie is some kind of cross between John Carpenter's The Thing and Invasion of the Body Snatchers. What it is instead is a mostly over-acted, over-sentimental clunker that starts with a strong, suspenseful opening hook, but spirals into an ending that feels rushed and is unfaithful to the novel.Kasdan, with co-writer William Goldman (whose lone previous King adaptation, Hearts of Atlantis, also took tremendous liberties with its source material, much to its detriment) put together a terrific cast for this movie, but nearly every performance feels stiff or lampooned.Lee is very good as Beaver, but his character is dead before the movie really begins to move. Lewis, so good in HBO's Band of Brothers, is good here too, but that seems lost in the logic problem that is his character, and Freeman seems to just be playing out the string. Tom Sizemore, as the more reasonable aid to Freeman's Colonel Kurtis, feels like little more than a body and a famous face in a fleshless role.The worst thing about this movie is the dialogue between the four friends, which wants to be clever in a very Kasdan, Big Chill kind of way, but instead becomes as grating as twisted machinery by the time they utter their thousandth or so acronym or childhood catch phrase.How in the world can a film with this cast, and with the pedigree of two Oscar nominees and the world's best-selling novelist be so boring?By the time this movie's third act comes along, it's so long and drawn out and boring that its silly climax feels less silly than it does absolutely unforgivable.Once again, someone adapting King doesn't trust the source material enough to stick to it, and the film suffers for this lack of confidence.Don't believe the trailer, and don't trust all the big names you see in the credits, this movie is one thing: bad. You'll be wasting your money on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read several of the comments on here about the movie, and I had to register just to add my $0.02.First off, several of the people writing reviews of the movie are doing it from the ill-informed vantage of not having read the book.S P O I L E RFor instance the person who wrote how odd it was that Morgan Freeman had top billing yet didn't even appear in the movie for 35 minutes. "Belatedly" was the word John Ulmer used, and Mr. Ulmer freely admitted to not having taken the time to get through the book. He also attributed this to Goldman and Kasdan, saying; "I assume that Goldman, an experienced screenwriter, realized Freeman's character would not get the audience's hopes up if he was introduced any earlier."What people don't seem to be pointing out is that the first half of the movie stays considerably loyal to the book, especially given the necessary evil of certain changes having to be made for time constraints. The only part I didn't agree with was introducing the "memory warehouse" so early in the story, my complaint over which relates to my next point.The second half of the movie basically got "Piked" (I'm sure Star Trek fans will understand that reference immediately). This is where the divergence became too significant to ignore, and the left turn in question took place for two main reason. The producers felt they need to "Hollywood"ize the movie, and they felt it necessary to treat the audience as cerebrally impaired, much like what happened with the original pilot of Star Trek.Stephen King is often described as a Horror novelist, but I believe in actuality he is a Terror novelist. Horror scares you and grosses you out, Terror takes your deepest fears and twists them around inside your guts. (More specifically, your lower intestine in this case).The problem is, producers don't often know how to translate terror into a big-budget film (these days at least). Instead, they try to dazzle us with the big-budget itself and hope we don't notice the difference Stephen King deserves better than that, and so did Dreamcatcher. But Gawrsh, I guess I's jus' plain too dumb to get it.*hyuk*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I received this book last Christmas and just loved it! I waited impatiently for two months for it to appear in my local theater. Just like so many others I was soooo bitterly disappointed! It started out not too badly, and I must say the "shit weasels" were not too shabby, but then it just leaves the whole plot line of the book and fires directly into never never land! In translating a book onto the screen, especially one as convoluted and involved as this one, it is incumbent upon the producers of the film version to simplify and clarify many plot elements. This usually results in the movie emerging as a necessary disappointment to those who have read the book. In this case, the film version was far more obfuscated and incomprehensible than the original book! They not only failed completely to simplify the film version, but most of the gratuitous changes themselves simply add additional confusion! Then they changed the whole ending to create a far more ridiculous and incomprehensible story line than even King himself could have imagined!(In the book, one of the characters notes to himself that if this had been a movie, Col. Kurtz would have to be played by either Christopher Walken or James Wood. If they had simply followed THAT piece of excellent advice, and also hired some script writers that WEREN'T into heavy substance abuse, well they might have had a chance....) As it stands, if you like gory Sci-Fi and you haven't read the book, well it might be ok for you...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILER ALERTS***Dreamcatcher was a movie I looked forward to seeing. When it finally unfolded itself to me, I was greatly disappointed.Dreamcatcher is a mix of all kinds of movies which -to me- were great. Here we have King writing a story which is stolen from all the greater movies. Let me put up a list...'Alien' - [story-line, plot]a creature that grows inside a living host and eventually bursts out; quite a lot of plot-turns were very much Alien/Aliens/... like.'Outbreak' - [story-line] do I need to explain?'Predator2' - [settings; sub-plot] the chasing, the settings inside the trailer; the overall mood'IT' - [story-line] the schoolboys-that-went-their-way- but-got-together-again theme with the let's-beat-it-together attitude'the Shining' - [settings; sub-plot] all those winter views, and one scene in particular where Evil Man is breaking a window to get in; I was just waiting for him to call out 'HERE'S JOHNNY!'; also the mister Jackyll/mister Hyde fun was very much alike the Shining.'Final Fantasy' - [plot] the plot where Big Evil fights Cleverly Hidden Big Good is so ripped, I couldn't believe it.Just a few that immediately came to mind during the movie. If I were to dig deeper, I would definitely come up with LOADS of other stories this story was based upon.All in all I found that King is getting huge creativity problems when it comes to making up stories. His plotlines are predictable and -even worse- stolen from (now) cliche-movies. It was a huge let-down to me, to see that plot-lines, story-lines and characters were so badly made up that they made no sense at all.On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this movie a very poor 2, only because the SFX lifted my moods every now and then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>so the movie started. it sets up character, mood, and a promising story of four men with some strange esp ability. and we see them set up camp in a cottage during a very cold winter, off in nowhereland. and it's good. it's intriguing, brilliantly odd almost.a dark wit, and chilling events lead up to the first big set piece of the film. which is one of the most spine chilling scenes of the year. but it's like a kiddie catapult, being pulled back so far, that when you release it, it just twangs and flops. as this movie does severly. as after that scene, it goes sillier and sillier. and you are only 45 minutes in, with another 80 minutes left or so. and yes, throughout those last 80 minutes, there a some good scenes, but something is so stupid about it, that you immediatly stop caring and start hoping that the end credits just pop up so you can go home. But the end credits never pop up. instead it introduces a horrible army plot, and the main plot goes beyond psychological, into pure sci-fi cliche drivel.the actors are fine, the direction is adequate, but the story? come on stephen king, we know you can do better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>F* me, Freddy! This is one of those movies which are so bad in so many aspects that I don't know even where to start. When I left the theater I was in a total stupor, knowing only one thing: it has GOT to be the worst movie of the year, I can assure that even being still in May. The plot twists and makes you ashamed of watching that thing.Spoilers hereon:WHY? WHY did they have those powers if they just don't help? Why did they have those powers being a pack of idiots? Anti-heros? The toothpick scene was probably the most retarded scene of the movie! I was laughing at it as I would laugh at MTV's Jackass! That guy deserved to die! When I was almost sure that the movie had something supernatural about that forest, like Blair Witch Project or something, noooo, it was actually an alien invasion. What was that? A crashed ship? Could somebody explain something to me or does all Stephen King stories have to be SO intangible? What was the dreamcatcher about? Did that indian straw craft catch an alien ship from a fifth dimension? What was that STUPID Mr. Gray stuff?! Why the British accent? WHY using the gun as a phone, WHY? What about TIMMY, I mean, DUDDITS!? So, at the end he reveals himself as a sort of interstellar cop, which means that he must have chosen living a lifetime on Earth as a retarded kid! I mean, wh.. why? Did he enjoy the marvels of a retarded life? Did that make any sense at all to stop the alien invasion? It just seemed totally useless, just like giving powers to that bunch of lame imbeciles. The rotating finger guy actually HELPS Mr. Gray to find the road! And how being run over by a car helped that guy not to die? How exoteric can it get? People say we will never understand the Universe by the following analogy: imagine the Universe is a soccer match, and that we are mere flies in the stadium, that can only see a stillshot of the instant in which the referee whistles the start of the match. Obviously, the flies don't get to know what's really going on. Well I felt like this while watching this movie, the difference between it and the Universe is that the Universe is unconprehensible because of its vastness and true complexity. This movie is unconprehensible because its swiss-cheese plot is a complete MAYHEM!I could go on for much longer. The worseness of this movie could actually be analysed scene by scene. Like: Scene one - Guy points revolver to his head. He lingers on and on, so I conclude immediately that either someone is about to knock the door or the phone will ring so he will be interrupted on such a quest. Guess what? The phone rings!!! He picks up the phone (although he could answer the gun as well, as one could see later in the movie), deciding not to suicide for the time. Instead, in a very intelligent move, he lets go of the weapon's percussor abruptly, firing the gun and destroying his certificate on the wall. Could this be a sign? In this movie, everything is a sign. Enough!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When looking at the trailer for this movie, there was one thing I was thinking: ok, this looks good, Morgan Freeman already starred in another Stephen King classic so what can go wrong? In two words, a lot! The movie doesn't really start bad, it does turn bad before you're halfway the stupid thing! The book itself was mediocre, not King's best, but maybe the best he wrote in the last five years. Unfortunately, the dialogs in the book (SSDD, "***k me Freddy", ...), all those little things and details from the book that were used in the film actually annoy you after awhile. The characters are stupid, unbelievable. The performances are weak. The story does seem to follow the book, but it's shortened a bit too much and a lot of things are explained too little and seem out of place: the scene in the car with the phone-call via the gun is just stupid in the film yet it was rather good in the book. Anyway, if you really want to see this movie, wait till they show it on television and don't waste your money by seeing it in theater or on video!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gigantic Mess Rarely Seen in Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King movie adaptations are usually a mixed bag. For every Carrie there's a Sleep Walkers or a Sometimes They Come Back. Let's not even discuss how many straight-to-video Children of the Corn releases there are (the answer, of course, is far too many). So what can we expect from a novel that featured butt weasels?Dreamcatcher centers on four friends and their annual hunting trip in the woods recounting an earlier time when they befriended a mentally retarded child who would later give each of them psychic gifts. At the same time it appears an alien invasion is nearby, the military are to quarantine the area, and the lost hunter has expelled a bloody serpentine-like creature from his bowels. What does it add up to? The craziest spring break ever man!There are several moments in Dreamcatcher where you think to yourself, `Well, it can't possibly get more stupid' and yet the movie routinely will find a way. It doesn't know when to stop. Just when you think the bottom of the Stupid Hole has been hit, here comes an alien possession where the alien uses a freaking British accent (and actually says the word "guvna'," proving to be the most dangerous interstellar chimney sweep). The only reason I knew what was going on was because I read the book over the summer.The story is a mixture of different King staples: smaltzy coming-of-age buddy stuff (It, Stand by Me), alien invasions (Tommyknockers), gory monsters (take your pick). Dreamcatcher feels like a Stephen King greatest hits tape. The different narrative elements have great trouble gelling, as you can only segue from retarded boy with mystical powers to crazy Morgan Freeman shootin' up slimy aliens so often. The story does not work, and has too many leftover bits it doesn't know what to do with. Dreamcatcher is a proverbial square peg being jammed into a round hole.The movie shows some promise in its opening, displaying the camaraderie of actors Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Damien Lewis and Timothy Olyphant (a younger looking Bill Paxton if I ever saw one). The notion of the "memory warehouse" is a fun idea that is used for nice comic touches.Director/co-writer Lawrence Kasdan has written some of the most exciting films of the past 25 years, and screenwriter William Goldman is an old hand at adapting King (having done the masterful Misery and the mawkish Hearts in Atlantis). So what in the world went so horrendously wrong? For starters, the book is a whopping 620 pages and would be more suited in the frame of mini-series. Condensed into a messy two-hour movie, Dreamcatcher is sloppy with its pacing and scope. The movie drags for an eternity and then makes a mad dash at a finish (I won't spoil its unbelievable awfulness but will say it veers SHARPLY from the novel).The most interesting part of the novel, for me, was the second half that involved the alien (Mr. Gray) taking over the body of Jonesey (Lewis). What kept me reading was from Mr. Gray finding a liking to human temptations like bacon and, later, murder. Seeing Mr. Gray become intoxicated with humanity and perplexed by it at the same time was wonderfully interesting. Sadly, all you get in the movie is the British accent and some goofy faces as Lewis holds two conversations in one person.Few movies come along that are as incredibly stupid as Dreamcatcher. I can't exactly recommend it for this quality. They are playing that Matrix cartoon after it (my theater showed it before the film started). It looks like a video game and features a woman doing gymnastics and sword fighting in a thong, because, quite simply, that's what women are required to do in these things. It's not really good either.C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compared to some of his other garbage, this is a fine King movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King's association with bad filmmaking is one of the given facts of his writing era, but Dreamcatcher was actually halfway decent. Coexisting nicely with the Sci-Fi and the horror, the only thing that hurt this film was the steam it lost midway through the movie. If the film had maintained the tension, it certainly would have been better. But that is always the trouble with King's adaptations. Capturing his essence of fear is nearly impossible, but at least this film tried its hardest. Even with a good cast and a respectable director, this film fell under the King curse of Hollywood, which has been a mixed bag of results the last ten years. Accept this movie as one of the better King adaptations, but don't bask in its spotlight too long.</fullReview>

According to the jaws principle, once you see the shark, the movie isn't scary and this one wasn't scary after the first killing. The final scene was just too off-beat to describe, and throughout the movie, I didn't think that Damian Lewis's dramatic acting was up to par.

		<fullReview>Watching this film convinced me we should leave dealing with aliens to people that might be able to present them in a better 'light'. Hello, calling Mr. Spielberg......If we consider the talent involved in this film and what comes out on screen, supposedly adapted from the Stephen King novel, it is a big disappointment. Mr. Kasdan, the director, and Mr. Goldman, the screen writer, have given us better things, so this venture will not harm their achievements.Some parts of the film are quite enjoyable. It is entertaining, if we forget the silliness of Morgan Freeman's bushy eyebrows, (I wonder whose idea that was?) and Jonesy affecting the English accent of his alter ego.The trouble I had with this film is that it doesn't want to make up its mind whether to play it straight, or go for laughs, since nothing is made clear throughout the length of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Lord, where to begin...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the great tradition of directorial visionaries such as Roger Corman and Bert I. Gordon, there now follows Lawrence Kasdan -- ah, MST3K, why did you have to go off the air when films like Dreamcatcher continue to somehow get greenlighted to this day, providing you with more fuel for your irreverant engines? Ok, in a nutshell : next to the verb "suck" in the dictionary will now appear the movie poster to Dreamcatcher. This film, which was a bad, bad, VERY bad amalgamation of Stand by Me/The Thing/Scanners/Flatliners/Outbreak/Rain Man/Independence Day, and has about as much to do with actual dreamcatchers as the movie Aliens had to do with Native America, provides the audience with a cast of "heroes" too stupid to literally stay on a toilet seat for five minutes to save their life (you think I'm kidding, don't you...). Plot points abound where you wonder if perhaps you should have gotten a pamphlet in advance of the screening to explain what the heck certain things mean (or perhaps the director figured the audience will have more fun making up certain things in the story, kind-of like a Mad Lib!), and speaking of plot points it would be nice if the director stuck with one instead of, oh, forty-three seperate storylines. Danny Bonaduce's (I'm sorry, I mean Damian Lewis') portrayal of John Cleese (I'm sorry, I mean Evil Alien Species) was just plain goofy, and you have to wonder why the villains didn't just outright kill certain cast members, as I'm sure the audience would have been happy to do the dirty deed if they could. Unfortunately, the 1000-word limit for these reviews prevents me from writing a doctorate-length thesis on the awfulness-level of this film (I say "film" only because other 4-letter words aren't allowed), so I'll just leave you with this : watch Dreamcatcher and you too will realize you can immolate your crotch in a campfire and then miraculously heal seconds later.Oh, and the Animatrix was cool. Very cool. Watch it, then leave : you'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie entirely on a whim, on the basis that seeing the Animatrix short on a big screen was something I couldn't miss and that the movie afterwards would probably be worth my money. Given that recent Stephen King movies have been more mature and less schlocky horror than his earlier fare, I figured I couldn't go wrong.How foolish I was.I enjoyed the first bit of the movie - the building mystery was very intriguing, and the relationship with Duddits was very nice. But then that old man showed up. I should've started to worry at the excessive farting. But when he EJECTED AN ALIEN FROM HIS RECTUM, I drew the line there. That alone was enough to stick this whole thing in the bad B-movie category.If I wanted to see a movie with Jason Lee and bowel monsters, I'd watch Dogma again. That, at least, didn't pretend to be something other than it was.Worst movie I've seen in ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Curious Misfire, Caught in a Web of Cliche Dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lawrence Kasdan is responsible for some of the most moving and honest ensemble dramas in recent film history. Films like "The Big Chill", "Grand Canyon" and the underrated "Mumford". Even when trying his hand at directing action ("Silverado"-the first studio western made in years) he strikes gold. His films carry a message, sometimes clear, sometimes a little vague, but there is never a doubt when watching a Kasdan film that you're watching anything less than a well thought out story, populated by some of the screen's most eclectic and recognizable performers; a story that never settles for anything below the honesty of realization. With this in mind, I pose what I think to be an honest question, deserving of an honest answer:What in the name of God went wrong with 'Dreamcatcher'?!I think I came up with some very good answers, at least the only answers I could figure out after watching this film twice. TWICE!The problem with 'Dreamcatcher' isn't necessarily the movie--it's the source material. Stephen King wrote his 600+ page novel while recouperating after being hit by a truck. His fans, worried that he might never write again were sedated by 'Dreamcatcher', a novel that merely incorporated every element that made King's earlier novels work and mashed them into a cliche of a book. It was as if King was doing nothing but letting his fans know that he could still churn 'em out, and with 'Dreamcatcher', he certainly did.That takes care of the first problem. The second was the decision to make the film adaption as literal as possible. William Goldman (no slouch in the screenwriting industry himself-'Butch Cassidy', 'Princess Bride', anyone?) tried with all his might to incorporate even the tiniest detail from King's novel, and as we all know, what might work in novel form, doesn't always work in film form.Another problem is that Kasdan himself has admitted to the fact that he is not a horror movie fan. Watching 'Dreamcatcher' one can easily understand that Kasdan was most certainly telling the truth. Someone schooled in the process of horror or suspense filmmaking would know that less is more. Kasdan, not being well versed in this field, is simply throwing everything at the audience, hoping that somewhere in this hodgepodge of special effects and gore, something will scare us. Well, he was wrong. There were a few moments of unnerving suspense (particularly the bathroom scene) but unfortuneately, after this scene the movie goes downhill.'Dreamcatcher' works best in its first thirty minutes or so. As usual Kasdan knows how to make characters likable and believable (as best seen in the roundtable B.S. session early in the film), but the film quickly falls apart with scene after scene of unbelievably bad dialogue, corny British accents, a ridiculous abundance of unconvincing computer effects and a completely unintelligible ending.And what are we to make of the sexual context of the film. There are no females in the movie, (technically there are two, but one quickly dismisses one of the men characters and another almost gets them killed), the alien creatures that serve as the antagonists of the film exit from the rectum and attack the crotch. They are more than subtly phallic shaped, and yet when their mouths open they resemble a razor toothed representation of the female genitalia. There is even a homosexual relationship hinted at between the characters (or more suitibly) caricatures of Col. Curtis (played by Morgan Freeman who we know is crazy because he has big, CRAZY eyebrows) and his protege Underhill (played by an embarassed looking Tom Sizemore, who could play this role in his sleep). There is even a shot of Curtis in a helicopter, the gattling gun attached to it's undercarriage becoming fully erect underneath the actor's legs. This may seem silly and trite, but I think the both Kasdan and Goldman are very smart people, and with imagery so obvious, it's hard to believe it slipped past them.The performances range from excellent (Jason Lee as the underused Beav, performing dialogue that only an actor like Lee could deliver) to the absolutley atrocious (Morgan Freeman, performing dialogue that normally he could deliver, except for some reason not in this movie).A curious misfire that is bombing horribly at the box office right now, this does have a few good moments, good ideas and mostly good actors, but is only worth watching for the first thirty minutes before the sheer stupidity and unintentional humor takes over and transforms itself from one of the most anticipated Stephen King adaptions in years, complete with A-List treatment, to a laughable, parody of itself and an insult to other, better adaptions that it so freely rips itself off from.Grade: C-</fullReview>

The photography at the very beginning of the film was fantastic...then shortly after this movie dies on the toilet quite literally. This is like a big budget version of Peter Jackson's "Bad Taste"...and this movie definitely has an even worse taste than Bad Taste...it's very much like feasting on a plate of worm like creatures...however I prefer to call it making cotton candy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Again, this is yet another film in the 'I expected a whole lot more' school of audience anticipation department. Face it, the television commercials appeared to promise something else entirely...Four latent psychic friends (taught their unique art years ago by an emaciated idiot-savant friend) reunite annually at their cabin in the Maine Mts. What they encounter their amounts to little more than what King fans have encountered in a few previous novels.Some of the set pieces here (their value ending up less than what the commercials may have led us to expect) are nevertheless interesting to watch. For instance, the marketing dept. for 'Catcher would have us believe that the squatting figure seen in theater trailers and movie posters was something far more esoteric in nature; the figure, female, is no shaman...or whatever...she's just suffering from the latter stages of parasitic alien contamination. Without further hairsplitting, King manages to cannibalize his own material and forces us (through the usually adept hand of Goldman) to watch what probably didn't sound interesting to read about, let alone sit through in a darkened theater to see with our very own eyes. Not to sound prude, but potty humor reaches its zenith in this film (can you say "alien suppositories," folks? eeeeewww!) restoring our faith in the latest filmmaking trend to include as much flatulence and bowel movement jokes imaginable, and not harming the creator's artistic (?) reputation one bit.As already known to the public at large, Dreamcatcher is a take-off on previous King efforts... namely "Stand By Me," "Tommyknockers" and especially "It."</fullReview>

I wasn't sure what to expect going in--maybe a few suspenseful, creepy thrills and chills, but about 1/3 of the way into the movie, I was kicking myself for having paid 7 bucks apiece for tickets. I am a HUGE Stephen King fan, and i had not read this particular novel; now i know to avoid it. I also disagree with the person who said that it was the best movie based on a Stephen King novel: Some of the TV miniseries based on his novels are better than this film! (The Stand, IT, Storm of the Century, etc.) Not to mention Kubrick's vision of "The Shining," De Palma's "Carrie" and Darabont's brilliant adaptations of "The Shawshank Redemption" and "The Green Mile." It was probably not the filmmakers' fault, because the film mainly suffered from a surprisingly poor plot from King. I hated the story above all else, but also wasn't crazy about the acting, which was staler than my 3 dollar popcorn, (I can't believe Morgan Freeman agreed to this film!!!) It's just a bad movie in general. Bottom Line: If you're a King fan who hasn't read the novel, or if you don't want to waste your time and money, avoid the film...</fullReview>

Jason Lee was another reason why I decided to stay for the movie, but of course he gets **spoiler** killed off first, and watching him fight the biting turd was embarrassing. **end spoiler**After realizing it was going to be an alien/action movie, I changed my expectations and started to watch it as just a fun action movie, and then I was still disappointed. The special FX aren't that good, the aliens aren't scary, and the ending sucked. This wasn't a psychological thriller type movie like I first expected, it also wasn't an alien/action movie, it was just pure crap.I've seen many movies, I have tons of DVDs, I'm a cinema fanatic, and I love/like almost every movie I've seen, but this has to be the worst movie I've ever seen!Save your money for something else, maybe Battlefield Earth II or Glitter 2..

		<fullReview>"Dreamcatcher" sucks, plain and simple, (which the movie isn't, simple that is) and it took me a couple of days after seeing it to arrive at that decision. (Possible spoilers ahead) I agree with anyone who says the early scenes that introduce the four friends and their ESP gifts are quite effective and feel very real, having Jason Lee and Thomas Jane helped out quite a bit and Damien Lewis was very good. But what does not feel real or in the least bit effective is the remaining 2 hours of the movie. The introduction of the aliens is ridiculous and the special effect are just silly most of the time. The second half of the movie really lost me, like when Morgan Freeman and his army wage war on an alien craft that's nestled in the mountains nearby (located somewhere in Maine, I think). The rest of the flick is a very shoddy mess and only the scenes where we see the inside of Jonesy's (Lewis) mind are noteworthy. It's really an overall giant waste of time, money and talent. Lewis is quite good as Jonesy and Mr. Grey and Jane is good though seems quite dumbfounded by what's going on (as we all are). I found the best line that sums up "Dreamcatcher", while I was watching an MST3K episode called "Future War" and near the end an explosion in a church, happened for some weird reason (that I will not discuss during this review) and one character (Mike) said "Huh?" and another (Tom Servo) said "The movie that delivers more huhs, per second." That I believe is the best way to describe "Dreamcatcher." 0 stars.</fullReview>

It was cool how instead of Darth Vadering the truck driver and the cop, he became an alien and riped them apart. I didn't mind the end too. So what if they turned Duddits into an alien, it gives the movie a new premise to work on. Instead of Duddits being a retard with super-powers, he's an alien, which kinda makes more sense. I would've been better if it had been more obvious that Mr. Gray was just a side effect of the fungus on Jonesy, but it worked out well.It may not be totally faithful to the book, it's still a cool movie. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>one seriously wonders what made first class actor morgan freeman participatein this movie (probably them trousersnake shaped aliens luring him with bundles of cash).if there is one memorable thought to waste on this piece of trash: "neverunderestimate the guys from the retard academy".ps: the camera work and the beginning sequence are exceptionally well done,thus it is 2 out of 10 points from me (rather than the 1/10 the movie trulydeserved).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WTF??!!!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Okay, Jesus Christ! What is this? For those of you who actually bothered trying to read Stephen King's 800 page novel (brave of you people) you guys knew what you should be expecting. But, all of us people that knew we could never finish a book of that size and just said "aw, f*** it" had no idea that this film would be like this.DREAMCATCHER was probably one of the most anticipated films of the year as the trailers were everywhere and pretty much everyone knew about this film. Morgan Freeman takes on a smaller role and its actually a bad guy one too. Even he isn't that special. DREAMCATCHER is not the film you want it to be. *MANY, MANY SPOILERS TO FOLLOW*I don't know about everyone else, but I was expecting it to be much more psychological. I knew the film centered around alien activity, but I was very disappointed as I was hoping the alien beings would remain as entities as they did in Mark Pellington's masterpiece THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES. *BIG SPOILERS* Instead, the film is warped about fifteen minutes into it. Some guy s**ts out a killer turd which procedes to eat people and this is mainly where I heard the most of the "what the hell?" remarks in the theater. While I was extremely disappointed with what DREAMCATCHER did *not* give us, I was somewhat entertained with what we did have. I don't want to sound like an a**hole for being one of the only people who probably enjoyed this film a little bit, but I did find it somewhat enjoyable.Most Stephen King book-to-movie adaptations are usually unpredictable because King usually writes with no perception as to how he will make his story twist and turn. With DREAMCATCHER, things happen that are never really explained. I could list some of them, but people would be like "what's he talking about?" so I'm not going to. Let's just say that DREAMCATCHER could have been a lot better and could have also stayed a little more mysterious, but instead is one of the most disappointing films of the beginning of the new year. I liked it, but I was really let down by it. I was also confused beyond all reason. So, good movie, weird as hell and totally confusing, but otherwise, I liked it. DREAMCATCHER gets 4/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I've finally discovered...THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!Yes, This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. I would rather watch a "Glitter", "Crossroads", "Eva" triple feature than sit through even 5 seconds of that stupid pile of garbage. When I say this was a horrible movie, don't think that I mean "Plan 9" bad; I mean "Battlefield Earth" bad.This "train wreck", because calling a movie cheapens the very word, lacked any on the elements necessary to define a film. It had1. A horrible story, which was, composed of all the stupidest sci-fi movies clichés.2. Cheesy and stupid special effects. There was enough money spent to make them look real and frightening but just enough money to make sure they weren't horrendously fake and thereby funny.3. Some of the worst acting I've ever seen ... period. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that every word was read off of cue cards located just off screen.4. Plot Holes, Plot Holes, and Plot Holes. Some of them big enough to fly a B-52 through.If you value your sanity then avoid this movie like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went not really expecting much, but started to get my hopes up in the beginning, as the story began...Unfortunately, that was soon lost as the movie became a mess.****POSSIBLE SPOILERS***************** The preview totally did not prepare me for the change in pace of the movie. From The Thing/Aliens-type suspense to a sudden change to It and Stand By Me atmosphere of childhood reminiscence as psychic wonder friends (complete with typically bad/unrealistic dialog as in many King movies, such as It), to Outbreak-type paranoia of containing the alien form, to a sudden switch to action-mode where 4 teeny helicopters try to take out a mother ship (straight from ID4), to the final chase and confrontation scenes.I dunno, King has written some good books, but there have been also quite a few bad book/story-to-movie translations of his (the Mangler, anyone?). I think a lot of elements in the movie which I thought were idiotic may have been more appropriate within the context of the book. These idiotic things were: - "I Dudditz!" (Especially when Dudditz yelled that out at the end during the final scene) - What the hell happened to those quarantined? - THe Mind warehouse thing (I'm sure it is better imagined when reading about it than visually shown in a film) - The inane dialogue - The unrealistic kids and their dialogue - The unrealistic dialogue of the 4 men in the cabin (Who talks like that?!)ARGHGHGGHGH! I'm getting all frustrated again even though I've had 24 hours to cool down...Please save your money!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a lot of promise and offers a few genuinely creepy moments early on. But those are interspersed with too many bodily emissions (Stephen King does bathroom humor...whodathunkit?) and before long "Dreamcatcher" takes a nosedive. This movie isn't sure what it wants to be. Hey, it's "The Shining!" No, wait, it's "Aliens!" Oh my, it's "Independence Day." Or perhaps "Stand by Me." In the end, "Dreamcatcher" -- in spite of its excellent cast -- is nothing more than a convoluted mess that's not even worth the price of a stock movie rental at the video store. Maybe wait for it to come on Saturday-afternoon network TV -- but only if there's absolutely nothing else on.</fullReview>

I gave this a "2", only because I really like Damian Lewis and the alien worms were well done. I felt the dialogue was very amateurish at best, more like a B movie set at the beach with horny coeds. I expected great things from the "Big Chill" creative force. Mr. King handed him great dialogue, on a platter, and he dumbed it down. "Bogus move, L".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is simply No place to begin with this one, it is so out-and-outhorrific. Of course, that is exactly why my friend and I went to see it.They don't make bad movies the way they used to, and this is therare film that sails way off the deep end, beyond mere bad and intosome area that cannot be comprehended by educated humanminds.There are SPOILERS AHEAD, though I assure it is not possible tospoil something that is rancid already.I have just a few questions: ?WHAT is the alien's reproductive cycle? They come out as a wormexcept when they're a red virus, except when they turn into a hugebug guy, who explodes and invades the mind, except when theycome out of a bunch of eggs laid by the worm, except when theworm and ONE egg come out together... Does ANYONE involvedwith his film have any idea what's going on here? ?How come the super-powerful big alien guy can't even get amanhole cover open? ?Okay, we all have our little vices, but when you have a toothy alienabut to bite your ass off, don't you think you could forego that onetoothpick? ?Is there some rule about when the psychic friends networkpowers work and when they don't? How come they can't foresee abig frozen woman in the path of their car? or that there's a big badalien in their house? Or that they guy stumbling out of the woods istrouble? Oh... cause it wasn't in the script. ?Okay, so you get the ONE alien hitchhiker... but you still have anentire ship full of aliens and all their red menace... isn't that aproblem? ?WHAT exactly happened at the end? All I saw was a bunch of jello. ?Did ANYONE read this script before it went before the cameras?Did ANYONE at Warner Brothers see this movie before they put itout there? Did ANYONE think, you know, this is all kind of stupid,isn't it?There are several classic moments in this film that will live withme forever. ?The crime-fighting, gee-whiz psychic friends network as children,singing to those in need of comfort, springing into action to findpeople they don't even know... I know my childhood was filled withthese kind of adventures. ?The ASININE mind-as-warehouse idea, with a window on theaction... where the character still has a limp! ?Many people have mentioned the inane English accented mr Gray ?The gun-as-phone sequence is in a class by itself ?The solemn seriousness of Duddit's mother's goodbye isCLASSICI looked at my watch an hour into this and COULD NOT BELIEVEthat I still had over half to go. Mr Kasdan-- Please, there is no need to consider suicide. Youcould just go into hiding, say, in Bangladesh, or Uzbekistan, andnever show your face to any human again. Maybe you could beadopted by apes in the rain forest, or take to a subterranian life inthe sewers of Manhattan. You see, there are many options. And Ido admire the way you've fearlessly said "You know, I have an okaybut middle-of-the-road career going here, how can I totally tank it inone fell swoop?" That takes guts. I admire that.

That's exactly how I felt when I left the cinema halfway thru this atrocity (incidentally the first movie I have ever not stayed until the end for). The only reason I don't want to contact the producers and demand compensation is because I would rather forget the whole thing.

It is rare that a tale be crafted so sloppily that is not only condescending to the viewer but has a complete lack of logic and causes an equal amount of frustration to the viewing audience.The movie starts out showing four longtime friends in separate situations utilizing their psychic powers. They group together at a cabin in a remote part of Maine just as they have for the past 20 years. There are several flashbacks showing how the four boys gained their extra sensory perception, by helping a mentally challenged boy who was being ridiculed by bullies.Before you know it animals are running with fear, Morgan Freeman (with a cameo hairstyle) is quarantining an entire village and our four heroes are left to save the world from alien forces who are here for who knows what.Tom Sizemore plays the role of Morgan Freeman's assistant. I am still trying to figure out what importance his character was to the story.I am sure Stephen King isn't happy with what could have been an excellent story.

I'll let you decide which one that was.Not even the high tech special effects could save this piece of junk.

		<shortDescription>Avoid This Film (Partial Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a movie I really looked forward to. It was basically slow moving and drawn out to the point that I felt like leaving after about an hour, but unfortunately did not in the hope it may improve. The acting was commendable, granted that there was likely very little to work with. The special effect were poor and looked like they were borrowed from a "B" movie. There was a lot of gore, but lots of blood does not make up for a poor story. It was simply potty training with blood. The suspense was pedantic. A child could have put a better story together.The trailer was very misleading as there is very little action or even much of a story. Think of it as "Stand By Me" with some telepathy and poorly designed aliens out to conquer the Earth that takes the viewer over two hours to sit through.Avoid or perhaps rent on DVD when available but do not waste any time or money seeing this at the cinema.</fullReview>

It starts out very strong, and then about (in the movie's case) thirty minutes into it, something just happens and the structure, the characters, the motivations, the monsters all just fall apart. Soon it's clear that everything that was good and decent about the first thirty minutes is going down with the ship. In the end, there were so many things that bothered me about this film that I don't want to highlight any particular aspect, because that might leave you thinking the other aspects left uncriticized might be good and worth seeing.

		<fullReview>May Contain SpoilersREDEMPTION FOR GEORGE LUCAS AND MARTIN SCORSESE!'Dreamcatcher' is for all the Star Wars critics out there who whined so self-righteously at Lucas's somewhat stilted dialogue in his two recent prequels. How they cried for the return of Lawrence Kasdan, who co-wrote 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi!' Well now we get to see what Kasdan opted to lend his attention to when Lucas passed him over. 'Dreamcatcher' is one of the most atrociously pathetic examples of cinema in recent memory, with dialogue so corny, a plot so convoluted, and a concept of aliens so absurd that it makes Stephen King's own abysmal 'Maximum Overdrive' look like 'The Day the Earth Stood Still.' Kasdan has lost all concept of pacing, of theme, of capable acting performances. His career has now officially jumped the shark.But Kasdan can't take all the credit. Due consideration must be given to the co-writer of this affront to filmdom, William Goldman. Here is a man who recently wrote an unprovoked tirade in Variety attacking Martin Scorsese, piously proclaiming that Marty does not deserve an Oscar for directing 'Gangs of New York.' Now he presents us with this dreck, a script so laughably incompetent that Michael Bay would have rejected it. Meanwhile, 'Gangs' is up for 10 Oscars. What appalling gall this hack has. Whatever you may think of 'Gangs,' its worst ten minutes are 100 times better than all of 'Dreamcatcher.'The only reason I would ever recommend anyone watch 'Dreamcatcher' is that it contains more unintentionally funny moments than I have seen in a movie in ten years. When Thomas Jane's 'Henry' answered a phone call from the mental incarnation of his alien-possessed friend 'Jonesy' by talking through the grip of a pistol (which was once owned by John Wayne, natch), I lost it. I was literally laughing out loud for several minutes, tears rolling down my cheeks. This train wreck of a movie is replete with such moments. If you can see it for free, take it in just to laugh at its ineptitude. If you are required to pay, however, avoid it like the plague.Rating 2/10 (one extra point awarded for unintentional humor)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I must say that this movie intrigued me from the television promos. It seemed like it would be a good movie about a male bonding in the woods gone awry. What this movie was/is, however, is a complete waste of time and money.Dreamcatcher starts off interesting enough, four friends going to their yearly retreat in a snowy cabin. But the minute the alien menace appears this movie degrades at a rapid pace. The movie shamelessly rips off Ridley Scott's sci-fi/horror classic, Alien but with much less taste, tact and skill, the movie makes no qualms or apologies about doing so (they even call the alien disease "Ripley... after the chick in that Alien movie"). (SMALL SPOILER AHEAD)The acting is second rate at best, Jason Lee is his usual sarcastic Kevin Smith-style self, but Damian Lewis should receive a Razzy for his performance as Jonesy (he takes schizophrenia to a knew thespic low). I find it very hard to accept that fine actors like Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore agreed to be in this movie. The script itself is terrible, the plot conventions are so weak and forced that I laughed multiple times, (A tracking device in a gun? Duddits is an alien?) and the ending is so melodramatic and fuzzy that it made me bust a gut laughing.Let me be clear in saying this, do not see this movie, do not rent this movie, only watch this movie if it is on cable TV, late at night, and you've seen the Thighmaster three-hundred times. 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

This was the second worst movie I've ever seen, second only to the disaster that is Battlefield Earth. This movie featured Morgan Freeman in the most cliched military commander ever (I don't think he read the script before he signed onto this movie... or before he actually showed up on the set to film the movie. His performance was that bad.) Tom Sizemore as the most gullible man on earth (Why does he get shot in every single movie he's in?), and several other actors who seemed similarly confused as to just what they were doing in this movie. The only redeeming factor was the Animatrix short "Final Flight of the Osiris". At least that had a coherent plot.</fullReview>

I give great kudos to the makers of the trailer. And those are the only people associated with Dreamcatcher that I give compliment. They did a good job of taking out all the wierd and unnessicary parts of the feature film that made it so very very bad.This will be a spoiler but believe me you wont be missing anything anyways! I was playing along with Dreamcatcher untill about 1/4th into the movie, where they just show too much. I may be spoiled by seeing M. Night Shamalan's "Signs," but lets get real, giant elephant sized larve taking over the world... and they have British accents!?! Putting top billing on Morgan Freeman capitalized on his big name, but he wasnt even in 1/2 of the movie, and his character was just around as a side-plot, a rather cliched bad-general who wants to kill thousands of diseased Americans without batting an eye.I got to see the Animatrix cgi cartoon, so thats good right? And the opening credits sequence to Dreamcatcher was cool! I would say the movie itself was interesting untill they killed Jason Lee's witty character. That was dissapointing. I'm honestly at a loss for words, this movie was filled with wierd computer animated creatures that looked like glorified boogers and fart joke after fart joke. Thats right, thats how the aliens hijack our bodies, by making us fart. Donny Whalberg's late entry into the film playing a 'mentally handicapped' friend was good. Whalberg seems to have a nack at playing characters with mental problems, a much better film example in "The Sixth Sense." But overall this movie robbed me of 2 hours of my life.I have come to the conclusion that, even though Steven King is a great author, there seems to be problems when translating his horror literature onto the big screen. Remember Thinner? The Langoliers? IT? Also not very impressive. King's dramatic work is excellent though, The Green Mile, Stand by Me, and (one of the best films ever) The Shawshank Redemption.So, my advice is: If you want to see a good alien-oriented horror film, see Signs. If you want to see a good Stephen King based film, see The Shawshank Redemption. Maybe wait to rent Dreamcatcher if you get in the mood for a bad 50s' creature film made in modern times... and watch it on a black and white TV because there really is nothing more one could do to this movie to make it any worse than it already is.Thumbs down!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rated this movie at a 2 out of 10. It appeared to be a very poor version of "It", and I wouldn't invite anyone to see this movie. Don't waste your money. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors, but his performance in this film was far below the standard he has set for himself. It just goes to show how a bad movie can affect an amazing actor's ability to contribute to the success of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to reveal any plot in this comment, but I will mention a specific scene or two at the very end. If you don't want to know, don't read it. I was extremely disappointed by this film. Having read the book, I know the film version could have been much better. The filming in several scenes reminded me more of a made for TV movie than a large motion picture. There were gaps in the story line leaving viewers (who had not read the book) confused. Other scenes were ruined by the overall cheese factor or changed from the original story line for no understandable reason. Such as the way the soldier with the dog is dealt with, or Duddits behavior in the final scene. The books version was much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit, I am not a Stephen King fan, but this movie was just plain horrible. It just tries too hard. There are enough "story lines" to create three separate movies!***spoilers ahead***1) Guys with psychic abilities go camping! (ignore the fact that they were bestowed upon by some alien creature)2) Crazy military commander leading an attack against aliens3) A "Stand By Me" sequel***no more spoilers from here on***The movie draws heavily from The Thing, and that hurts it badly. The technology used to create Dreamcatcher is much more evolved than that from the days of The Thing, and therefore, I suppose they decided that giving the creatures more screen time was a good idea... it really wasn't. They STILL look like Muppets gone bad. Half the movie you don't know whether to laugh, or just plain feel sorry for the characters, or moreso, the actors portraying the over-the-top cliches we've all come to love (or hate, for that matter) in horror films.Hell, just "guys gone camping" would have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dear God in heaven - what happened to this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I am a huge Stephen King fan. I have listened to all the King audiobooks I can get my hands on. I enjoyed listening to Jeffrey DeMunn (who played Harry Terwilliger in The Green Mile) read Dreamcatcher. Stand by Me is one of my all-time favorite movies. I had high hopes for Dreamcatcher.This movie is not Dreamcatcher. It is a bad joke based loosely on Dreamcatcher.The characters are good, the special effects are good. I was even happy that the gore (monsters coming out of butts) was tolerable. But the twist at the end was unforgivable. Duddits is not a gifted retarded boy dying of leukemia. He is, turns out, a monstrous alien, sent here (I guess - who knows) to foil a takeover plot by a competing alien race? WTF?Imagine you're watching Stand By Me and, at the end, Ray Brower, (dead kid) gets up, puts his Ked's back on, and shoots Ace and Eyeball. Then he and the guys walk back into town and shop for bunk beds.Imagine you're watching The Green Mile and, at the end, John Coffey tears free of the electric chair and crushes Paul Edgecomb's head like an egg.Imagine you're watching Carrie and, at the end, Carrie becomes a nanny and teaches children to sing while dancing through the Austrian countryside.Try this mental exercise and you will be ready to watch Dreamcatcher.Don't get me wrong - I can't fault Stephen King with this - at least not completely. I will continue to read/listen to/watch his work. I especially hope to see a film adaptation of "Bag of Bones".But SOMEBODY BUTCHERED THIS FILM. I DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS BUT THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES!</fullReview>

And the last half hour...forget it. So beyond moronic, its practically unwatchable. I mean did this thing even have a script? Or was it a mission to keep all the bookworms happy by putting every possible element of the novel into the movie. Either way it didnt work and we end up with a completely illogical mess. I swear at one point I didnt know what was going on. Like the way the character Henry figures out the whole master plan, completely out of nowhere was laughable! But hey, after 90 minutes I guess they had to finally move the story along. And I wont even go into how pointless the whole military part of the film turns out to be. Bad movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted I may be a biased source, as I didn't sit through the entire film (or this may help my point), but no matter how well the movie concludes, it is not worth sitting through the vile, repugnant things at the beginning. And I'm not just talking about the blood-and-fecal bathroom scene. While that may be the greater of the two evils, the foulness of this movie was tangible from the first shot. Like, when the whole supernatural powers of the characters is being established, its just shown in a completely unimpressive, unimaginative way. They literally use the line "How did you know? You weren't there!" twice. It was ill. One small detail that truly irked me was the use of unnecessary vulgarities. In particular, when it showed them as kids, and they said something stupid and childish (such as the bespectacled little runt say "Jesus Christ Bananas" or whatever) and then them repeating it when they're older, just so its Absolutely, Completely KNOWN that they're the same people.Bottom line, if you want to see a good Stephen King adaptation, watch The Shining or Carrie or IT.

		<shortDescription>King craps again, but this time a passable turd.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't the "Dreamcatcher", it's the "Clichécatcher". Clichés were flying by in King's empty little ugly head, and he caught them all, one by one, various movie clichés, turning this movie into a conglomeration of horror/sci-fi nonsense we've all seen a million times before.I have several questions for King and/or Kasdan (because I don't know which of the two clowns is responsible for which bit of nonsense): 1) If the 4 friends have these powers then how come were they caught by surprise once the plot moved to the cabin? There were half a dozen situations in which their mental skills or mental alarms failed to switch on. Why? 2) If Morgan's been chasing the aliens for 25 YEARS, and the aliens multiply with such STUNNING EASE, then how could they have possibly failed to infect the whole planet by the time this plot started? 3) Whose dumb idea was it to show the mind as some kind of collection of rooms in which two "minds" chase each other like cat and dog? 4) What happened with the huge alien spacecraft and all its inhabitants? 5) Why does the "good alien" help humanity i.e. why is he the good "guy"? (this one's for Kasdan)When the movie started I saw Donnie Wahlberg's name. Fair enough, I thought, this is probably a dumb movie so why not star a lousy actor like himself? Yet the movie went on and on, and I wondered where the hell is Marky Mark aka Wahlberg? Not that I was complaining about his absence! But then when I saw the military forces I thought, oh well he must be a gung-ho soldier, that's the typical kind of part for that uncharismatic bird-brain rapper. But I never could have guessed they'd cast him as the "good alien" i.e. the "retarded man"?!!!! I couldn't believe it. WHO had the idiotic idea of casting Marky for that part? Has all of Hollywood completely gone insane? Wasn't Will Smith bad enough as Ali? What's next? Drew Barrymore as U.S. President? Julia Robert as Mother Theresa?The movie's logic doesn't add up. However, considering it's a dumb horror film, it doesn't really have to. Plus, considering whose book it was based on, the movie wasn't even half-bad. It was okay, watchable. Dumb, but not too bad, if overlong. I mean, 135 minutes?? What did they think they were filming? "Lawrence Of Arabia"?Most of King's stuff is very linear, quite simplistic, so it was a bit of a change for us poor, suffering King-victims to see a plot that is a little more complex. Clearly, complexity is not King's forte. Stick with simple dumb stories! On the other hand, the simpler ones are more annoying... Hmm...On second thought, just quit writing novels, King. Just imagine your silly little books are like those anal aliens, turds that threaten our planet: save our Earth, King!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My dad rented this DVD about 2 years ago. Me, my mum and him all sat down ready to watch this horror. After hearing Morgan Freeman was in it i thought it must be worth-watching. The first few scenes were slow and boring, it showed random parts that were pretty confusing, it was all over the place. But the worst was yet to come! This man comes stumbling into these hunters lodge saying he saw "lights in the sky", this made me curious, it was excited to see if it was a monster of UFO. Instead it was plan jumbled rubbish. The acting wasn't too bad put the story-line was terrible, i love Stephen King movies but there was no climax or tension it was pure confusion. Then it dragged on and introduced more characters which were unnescessary. Overall i would not advise this film as One-To-Watch.Do not buy it or even rent it unless its ?1!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the book before watching this movie so I have no idea what it would have looked like to fresh eyes. I imagine many parts of it would have been confusing.It was a fair enough adaptation of an 879 page Stephen King novel, but there really was a lot of details that were left out, changed, and in some cases there were some things not in the book that got added....like the ending: Duddits physically kills Mr.Gray by becoming an alien lifeform himself. Kurtz (called Curtis in the movie) gets to the reservoir where the others are in a stolen chopper and Owen's gift gun from Kurtz with the bug in it (no psychic byrum-filled Perlmutter needed)is how he even finds them in the first place. As for Henry's earlier escape from quarantine - General Mathieson takes over - no Henry borne uprising in the quarantine needed to break free. Not much mind-reading going on at the army setup at Gosselin's. Not much mention of Mindspeak aside from D and the 4 friends at all.On the other hand I did like how Jonesey's warehouse of memories was portrayed. Those scenes are just as I'd imagined them while I was absorbed in the novel. And also the scenes of when they are younger were done well. The line was supposed to be yellow, nonetheless the line was portrayed interestingly in the movie (similiar looking to Donnie Darko's). Too bad we never got to see them bringing Josie home to the worried Rinkenhauer parents gathered at the Cavell's. The film is good to begin with, then everything kinda speeds up and gets messy and that seems to be when all the major additives came in. Too bad! I'd say read the book, and enjoy it, because it's great, just don't get your hopes up for the film.</fullReview>

My husband only had one comment before he changed the channel. To give us all an idea of what the rest of the movie would be like, he thought the scene with the animals running out of the forest should have ended with one of the animals coming up to the guys in the cabin and saying "Run! The Tasmanian Devil is coming!" This would have been better if it was a cartoon.We can all try to act intellectual, but hunters sitting in a cabin having philosophical conversations about how one of them pictures his memories as files in a storehouse is, well, boring and weird. I did crack up when the guy possessed by Mister Grey was running around in his mind, and ranting (with a British accent, no less) to show he was trying to save his memories from the alien. Also, don't you think aliens coming out of your rear is a little "Beavis and Butthead"?</fullReview>

I decided in favour of laughing every time the 'alien' spoke. I never realised before that evil aliens had a posh English accent.Too many plot holes and unexplained events. I couldn't get over that if the aliens sole purpose was to kill everyone and they were advanced enough to get here etc, etc, then why didn't they just land in the city in the first place. These aliens have been coming here for 25 years and they cant land in a populated area; jeez.Well, I'll score it a 4.

But with It, the books got longer and longer and recycled plot lines; eventually, they all ended up in ludicrous land.With the exception of movies like Stand By Me, Carrie, Misery, The Stand, The Green Mile, The Shining (Kubrick's) and The Shawshank Redemption, a good chunk of King's movies have been horrible (Think Maximum Overdrive. Or The Langoliers. Or, the God-awful Rose Red. Okay, maybe we shouldn't think about those!) Even the best of his books haven't translated well to film -- Salem's Lot and Pet Sematary the movies stunk. I credit a good part of this to the directors who end up giving us gore, special effects or campiness when we want true horror.Which brings us to Dreamcatcher. When I heard that Lawrence Kasdan, a serious director, and Morgan Freeman, a serious actor, were involved, my hopes soared. And the first third of the movie was great -- despite King's tendency to focus on some childhood coming of age theme (and the emphasis on flatulence), I had real chills -- the frozen woman in the snow, the unknown monster in the bathroom. I thought that Dreamcatcher was finally living up to my hopes -- a genuinely creepy movie that delivered the scares without bad acting, preachy dialogue and monsters that ended up looking goofy instead of scary.I was wrong. I'm trying to decide the exact point where Dreamcatcher turned from a real horror movie to just one more B-movie. Maybe it was when we actually got a good look at the "monster;" in this case, giant worms. Despite the mouthful of needle-sharp teeth, they were still worms. Worms weren't scary in Tremors, either ... but I digress. It's always somewhat disappointing when you actually see the monster. M. Night Shyamalan's Signs was great until the last few minutes of the movie when the alien was revealed in the light of day to be an average-sized green guy. Blair Witch was scary precisely because we never saw the monster. So the worms, and then the gelatinous aliens, were just cheesy.Or maybe Dreamcatcher started its downhill turn with, of all people, one of my favorite actors, Morgan Freeman. So good and dependable, Freeman phoned in his performance as Blue Team leader. Granted, he didn't get any help from the overblown speeches they chose for him to deliver, but still ... this guy is a great actor and should have been more than a one-dimensional crazy.Add in all the believability problems (honestly, were they really able to contain every animal exposed -- including the birds? What happened to all the people in the containment camp? How would one worm in the Boston water supply kill the world), and the film just fell apart in the second half. What a waste of talent like Jason Lee (losing this funny guy early was detrimental) and Tim Sizemore (what was he thinking signing on to this mess?). And why oh why did the alien Mr. Gray sound like John Cleese? Who thought that voice would be scary? I kept thinking of Monty Python...I haven't been that happy for a movie to be over since I made it through Mars Attacks. And at least that movie had no pretensions of being anything more than what Dreamcatcher ended up being: a parody. Save yourself $8.50 and skip the latest Stephen King movie, and go buy Salem's Lot at your bookstore. For us King fans who still hope to be scared by the former master, turning back to the classics seems to be the only way that's going to happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Butt weasels? Are you kidding me?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason this movie was made is Stephen King wrote a novel. When King writes a novel, the movie is guaranteed. No matter how ridiculous. Seriously--there are butt weasels. What floors me is the A-list actors they got for this horrible flick. Morgan Freeman, Tom Sizemore, Jason Lee--I hope they all got paid a buncha bucks for this sorry excuse for a movie. To be fair, I haven't read the novel. But I hadn't read "The Shining" or the volumes comprising "The Green Mile" or even "Carrie," for x's sake, before I saw the respective movies. But each of these was a compelling, stunning masterpiece (that might be an overstatement for TGM. But bear with me). But Dreamcatcher...not even in the same league. We're talking single-A farm team compared to the majors, baby. So there's aliens, and good guys, and bad guys. And butt weasels. And there are a WHOLE BUNCH of other movies that should be ahead of this one in your queue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would rate this movie a 1, but I can't quite do it. I like the cast a lot, and sometimes good people make bad decisions. Not every Steven King script warrants being turned into a movie. Enough people will go see these movies to make it worth putting the bare minimum effort into producing a film, but the fact that the movies are SO popular seems to mean that there is no longer any quality control.This is basically the worst movie I've seen in years. The script is bad, the acting is worse, the special effects are disgusting, not cool, and the entire premise - parasitic shape-shifting sewer aliens? - is so ludicrous it barely even warrants comment. Steven King has reached new lows, not to mention Morgan Freeman. Will someone please tell me what he is doing in this godforsaken mess of a movie? Also, Jason Lee turns in what might be the least funny performance of his career.As far as I can tell, the take-away messages of this movie are that 1)you can't just assume that your toilet is a safe place to sit, and 2)mentally handicapped children are actually aliens.The previews for this movie are actually decent. I haven't felt so misled and disappointed since the time I accidentally rented "Silence of the Hams" instead of "Silence of the Lambs."</fullReview>

I hope, for the future generations of movie watchers, that this film is never aired again. It is rather sad that there are so many talented actors in the film, such as Morgan Freeman (he's the reason I watched his), because their skills are wasted. I now know to look a movie up on the IMDb before watching it "OnDemand."

		<fullReview>This was not one of the best SK movie because they left out a lot of detail. Some really big parts. But overall it was great. It will have you on the edge of your seat 99.99% of the time. The cast included Morgan Freeman, Damian Lewis, Thomas Jane, Tom Sizemore, and more. Morgan Freeman places a madman who wants to kill Tom Sizemore. Damian Lewis plays the riveting role of Jonesy. He did a fantastic job of being a "Double Person". Thomas Jane plays a telepath who sends brain waves to Damian. Tom Sizemore plays colleague of Freeman and betrays him. The movie should receive a 5 out of 10 stars because it leaves out some very important details!!! But like I said before this movie was a little convoluted like the book but comes together in the end as always.</fullReview>

Some of the most disturbingly retarded parts of the movie included that stupid British accent the guy had and the stupid sound made when he put his hood up which somehow indicated that the British alien was in control over his mind. That retarded kid, Dudditz was a complete joke and I kept wishing he would just die. The movie hung itself when that guy talked into his gun like it was a phone... just what the hell was that?The movie had almost NOTHING to do with a dream catcher at all. I do vaguely remember a vague reference to something resembling a dreamcatcher, however it was only there for the record and excuse to use the title "Dreamcatcher".Dreamcatcher sales by American Indians dropped by 86% after this movie was released.</fullReview>

The acting was substandard, the special effects were laughable and the story line was ridiculous.The only thing scary about Mr. Gray is the fact he had a horrible British accent.

		<shortDescription>The GREATEST COMEDY of the YEAR!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite frankly, DREAMCATCHER is so unbelievably bad it jumped that discernible median and posited itself amongst the best, unintentional comedy flicks of all time! It now sits only 3rd to SHOWGIRLS and BEYOND THE LAW as the most atrociously executed and shamefully hilarious films I've ever seen. The ONLY way that any one on Earth could enjoy this is film for what it was meant to be (a taught, Sci-Fi Horror?!) is if they were a brain-dead monkey on crack, IMO. Having said that, I will now gloriously recommend it to everyone I know!I have NEVER laughed that hard in a theatre during a movie in my life! I've seen some great comedies and even a few good chucklers in my time, but DREAMCATCHER actually had me holding my stomach, tears in my eyes, gasping for breath laughing. And I wasn't the only one. What began with an exceptional and promising opening credits montage, rapidly began descending (we're talking 90-degree slope here, folks) soon after the actual "story" began. About 15 minutes in I turned to my sister and sincerely asked, "Is this supposed to be a comedy?" I am not kidding, the acting and plot were truly that over-done that I had to ask. This film also provided equally side-splitting laughs while recalling certain scenes and snippets of dialogue or catch- phrases all the way home afterwards.How on 'God's Green Earth' does an actor of the magnificence and undeniable talent of Morgan Freeman, not only accept this role and carry through with it as it's being shot and performed, but actually give THE worst performance of his entire career, and quite possibly, amongst the very worst in cinematic history?!?! Freeman will take the brunt of the criticism to be sure, such is his level of reverence as an 'actor's actor', but in truth, EVERY SINGLE PERFORMANCE IN THIS FILM WAS BEYOND DESPICABLE!!!!!!!! It was as if I was watching an incredibly bad teen horror-flick ---------- --------entirely acted by grown-ups! Jason Lee, Tom Sizemore, Thomas Jane, Timothy Olyphant and Donnie Wahlberg make first- time, high school, drama class kids look like veteran thespians in comparison. And the story is so implausible, inane, far-fetched, undeveloped, unenthralling and half-a$$ed as to beggar the imagination! (I won't even begin to dissect the story and/or plot, not that I could even hope to attempt it...) Without a doubt though, Damian Lewis gives one of the Top 5 vomit-inducing performances in history; he alone must be seen to truly understand how talent-impoverished and subsequently hilarious an actor can be (truly inspiring for those with no hopes of ever making it in Hollywood).I could go on endlessly both deriding and praising DREAMCATCHER but the bottom line is that it is undeniably one of THE very, very, very WORST films of all time, yet also, one of the new classics in terms of "cinema so bad, it's great!" No one involved with this film, from the director to the guy who had to scrape gaffer-tape off the floor should be allowed to ever go near a film production (or any form of recording device) ever, ever again!HORROR: 2/10. Possibly the crappiest Horror/Sci-Fi/Thriller of ALL time!!!COMEDY: 10/10. A group 'must-see' of unparalleled importance!!! Oh, how I enjoyed it for all of the most wrong reasons...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DREAMCATCHER (2003) ** Morgan Freeman, Thomas Jane, Damian Lewis, Jason Lee, Timothy Olyphant, Tom Sizemore, Donnie Wahlberg. Listless Stephen King adaptation about a quartet of childhood buds on their annual hunting retreat who encounter an evil alien force hell-bent on a full scale invasion during a blizzard and a special Army sect equally compelled to eradicate the foreign threats. A game cast of varied strengths (Lewis is especially good as the buddy co-habiting with dual personalities when one of the slimy creatures infests his body) cannot sustain the suspense and decent storyline that seems lost in the translation by William Goldman and director Lawrence Kasdan which plays as a check-list of previous King themes (mind telepathy, gifted children, overzealous militia, etc.) and a hodgepodge of scores of genre flicks including `The Thing', `Alien' and `The X-Files'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe this has got such bad reviews. I watched it as a fan of Damian Lewis and thought it was absolutely hilarious; Damian is the best thing about it, admittedly, but he's so funny! The switching between accents is fab, and his American accent is so good I didn't recognise his voice at the beginning. Morgan Freeman is terrible! I'm shocked by his performance. However, I thought the relationships were portrayed really well and I loved Jason Lee and Thomas Jane. And who doesn't like aliens which come out of weird places? No, it's good because it's laughable. If you don't take it too seriously it's actually quite enjoyable. Also, the young actors in it are fantastic. There are so many good quotes in this. See it if you want something funny and not serious at all.</fullReview>

This is a solid movie, very well acted. The effects are just fine, and not really that important. And the story was just out of this world. I mean crazy.

It's almost insane how original it is.This is one of those movies that gets dogged when it comes out, but mark my words, ten years from now it will be considered a groundbreaking classic. Snooty film enthusiasts will scoff at the notion that it didn't do well and was poorly recieved, when they will most likely be some of those who bashed this movie.

		<shortDescription>ambitious adaptation held back by its running time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a few exceptions, the best adaptations of Stephen King novels have been television miniseries stretched out over several nights, because the format allows ample time to extensively develop plot and character; film, on the other hand, has the disadvantage of having to compress the intricate prose of King's novels, usually sacrificing a lot in the process. Which is the main problem with "Dreamcatcher", a film that's just too crammed with characters, subplots, to the point where two hours of celluloid isn't enough time to develop them all. This is a shame, since the premise is extremely interesting: a group of childhood friends save a mentally handicapped child from some tormentors, only to have themselves endowed with a form of psychic communication; twenty years later, an alien force is at work in a snowbound Maine woodland where they're vacationing. The film contains a visual flair that captures the tone of King's prose in the setting; the characters, too, are a collection of down-home everymen with a quirky, dry sense of humor. And there are other unique touches, such as the visualization of the inside of a man's mind (shelves stacked with boxes of information, plus a room reserved for secrets), and dual personalities inhabiting one body speaking back and forth. Morgan Freeman, whose role seems like an afterthought, plays a veteran alien-blaster who gruffly recites hammy dialog in a thankless performance. The special effects are a truly irritating overload of CGI that looks all the more unconvincing on the small screen. "Dreamcatcher" makes a noble attempt at being a reputable Stephen King adaptation, but the confines of a commercial film ultimately restrict its potential for success.4.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneasy mix of sci-fi and friendship saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When did Stephen King start repeating himself? "Secret Window" is a riff on one of his other works, "From a Buick 8" rehashes the sinister car idea previously explored in "Christine" and here we have the friendship of four boys, as seen in "Stand By Me."These are a different four schoolboy buddies, and as children they discover life instead of death, but the "Dreamcatcher" quartet go on to troubled adulthood and get drawn into a quest to save the world while making their yearly pilgrimage to the woods of Maine.The scriptwriters deserve credit for the much necessary paring down of King's book. Their need to simplify his ideas, especially concerning the memory library, means some things may get left unexplained, which shouldn't happen in a movie well over 2 hours. Goldman in particular has plenty of experience adapting King's work, most notably "Misery" - which coincidentally also features isolation and lots of snow. The best scenes in "Dreamcatcher" are the early ones of the four friends' hunting trip and the lost stranger they rescue. The actors are superb in these scenes, most notably Jason Lee as Beaver. Unfortunately, whereas the book opens with these scenes, the film spends too long setting up the characters in advance, and then by the nature of the sci-fi element, has to change direction too quickly. This is perhaps the biggest fault with the story as a whole. Sci-fi has never, by his own admission, been King's forte, and here he tries to weld a study in friendship to a whiz-bang alien invasion story. The result will leave many disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreamcatcher is proof that a "high-class" monster movie is far worse than a more honestly simplistic one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: * out of **** Those who know me realize I'm a pretty lenient guy when it comes to movies. And I have to be since I'm such a huge fan of horror, a genre renowned for spitting out crap at an alarmingly disproportional rate compared to its quality films. So being the easy guy that I am to please, I feel I should at least briefly mention what I liked about Dreamcatcher, namely that it boasts a first-rate cast and almost easily the best production values of any Stephen King adaptation and...well, that's about it.Yet another addition to the pile of failed Stephen King adaptations, Dreamcatcher is little more than a mish-mash of almost every conceivable plot King has written since the beginning of his prolific career. An opening sequence gives us separate introductions to each of four best friends (played by Tom Jane, Damian Lewis, Jason Lee, and Timothy Olyphant), who all display somewhat varying levels of psychic abilities. Anyway, these four go on a hunting troop in the woods, but a couple of mishaps split them into groups of two and each pair must deal with a fairly immediate crisis.To make matters worse, the animals in the vicinity all seem to be retreating from a perceived threat and the area is put under quarantine with the arrival of a black ops team (led by Morgan Freeman), whose specialty is (I kid you not) exterminating extraterrestrials that pose a threat to the survival of the human race. Freeman's second in command is played by Tom Sizemore, and it won't take a genius to guess the two will tussle over the way the situation should be handled. Meanwhile, the four pals have to deal with slithery aliens that can apparently shapeshift into more traditional grayish, bipedal E.T.'s (except way taller) and also turn into red dust that's capable of possessing a human body.I'll start my critique off by stating who should not be blamed for the disaster the film turned out to be, and that's virtually the entire cast. With the exception of Donnie Wahlberg, this highly-talented ensemble does a more than passable job of mustering solid conviction when they deliver the cheese-dripping dialogue. It's all the more pity the film is as terrible as it is; this cast is arguably the best assembled for a Stephen King adaptation since The Shawshank Redemption.I also liked the cinematography, which captured the beauty of the snow-covered landscape, even doing a fine job of developing a quietly sinister atmosphere in the film's early moments, and that's something most genre movies can't seem to accomplish these days. Some of the visual effects are also initially interesting to behold, though they grow more unconvincing as the film progresses.But that's virtually the extent of everything I liked about Dreamcatcher. If I had to peg someone specifically for the crap this movie turned out to be, it'd have to be Stephen King, because the source novel itself is poorly written sci-fi nonsense. Chief among the poor writing is the "in-joke," nostalgic dialogue between the four friends that's obviously amusing to them, but is stale and silly to my ears. Perfect example? "Scooby-Dooby Doo, we've got work to do." The story is riddled with contrivances that rely on character stupidity, one such instance occurring early in the film which shows a compulsive toothpick-biter who's sitting on a toilet lid to keep an alien from getting out, but he actually risks getting off the seat just to reach for a toothpick on the floor; sorry, but that's the kind of "characters acting in stupid ways to advance the plot" b.s. I just can't buy.The film boasts a number of baffling plot holes: why do only two men go in search of a renegade alien when the entire military is at their disposal (heck, it's only the entire world at stake)? How is Mr. Grey is able to turn back and forth from the alien shape to Jonesy without tearing any of his clothes? And why doesn't Jonesy just turn into his powerful Mr. Grey form to break down that door and remove the manhole rather than going through the trouble of it in his much weaker human form? The movie also frustratingly fails to establish what the alien creatures are fully capable of. Early scenes indicate they're shapeshifters, able to vacillate back-and-forth between their serpent forms, bipedal body structure, and that red dust, but none of this is explored to a satisfactory fashion. I'm also not sure why all the aliens didn't just use the red dust method to possess the humans in the surrounding area.It's hard to say what director Lawrence Kasdan was aiming for. The early scenes indicate a more subtle, atmospheric approach, but that's out the window less than an hour in. Maybe that's just as well, I can't stand psychic links anyway, and couldn't bear to see a 136-minute movie devoted to this lazy plot device. To my chagrin, it still manages to figure into the last half-hour as a pretty lousy way of advancing the story.As a gory slime-fest with hostile alien creatures, the movie's almost a total bore, the story switching back-and-forth between different characters and never developing momentum for any of these individual plot strands, not even when they eventually converge. You might also be a little miffed by the lack of man vs. monster action, these aliens prefer a sneakier approach to taking over the world.If anything, Dreamcatcher is a good reminder that creature flicks work best when they maintain a stark simplicity rather than veering off on more "ambitious" tangents like this movie attempts. There are number of wonderful monster movies set in secluded locations, films like Pitch Black, Deep Rising, and John Carpenter's The Thing. I highly suggest you check all of those out instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreamcatcher is a Crazy and Insane film but a brilliant one none the less.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember being an eight year old back in 2003 when this was initially released and seeing it at a drive in being paired up with a film called Cradle 2 the Grave I really don't remember that film all that much since than but I've became a big fan of this every since then.Dreamcatcher starts out with a eerie atmospheric title sequence that gets you straight into the mindset that this wants you to be in while it takes you on this delightfully bizarre journey. We get introduced to H(played by the always terrific Thomas Jane) a psychiatrist who predicts this morbidly obsessed man we feel from his character that of H as he after his session with the obsessed man with his thought-out succeeded attempt but then he gets a call from Jonesy a principle? which indicates in a brilliant manner that their is a psyche link between them.Then we get introduced to Pete Moore a car salesman who helps out a ladies to get her car keys but he ultimately freaks her out.Than lastly we get introduced to the last player on the main friends Bever who has some memorable one liners that you will be catching yourself use a few times post viewing of the film and Bevear is so endearing he sees potential harm of his friend Jonesy in the way he gives him a call to warn him. So that chunk introduces us to our four likable and unique friends three of them are genuinely kind people we can relate to in H,Jonesy &amp; Bevear while Pete also Kind at moments kind of got a little bit of asshole vibe to him still likable. Then we actually get into the plot of the film with Jonesy getting ruined over after he saw a young Duddits across the street of which is vital importance to the plot. Then they take their 20th annual camping trip to the whole in the wall where we get some terrific atmosphere and where we get to know the characters a little bit more with their conversations. We get the first flashback of them helping Duddits from some nasty bullies. The film than takes us one the last few hours of peace the character will have with H and Pete going out for some supplies while Beaver and Jonesy are hanging out hunting than they slowly help out this man at that moment H &amp; Pete almost ran over this laddie. Beaver and Jonesy start noticing something is a little bit off while some animals are running away from a Helicopter with a beyond crazy and great prof-romance from Morgan Freeman unlike anything he has done before.But after that both Beaver &amp; Jonesy realize that the man they helped earlier is in some pain as he's dripping blood and is locked in a bathroom they boost the door down to find the dead body of him and this is where the fun of the film begins. In a From Dusk till Dawn style turn the film becomes something really special. They try to hold down the aggressive force trying to break it's way out of the toilet and in a very questionable stupid twist of fate Beaver with his Tooth Pick Addition try to pick up a toothpick on the disgusting bathroom floor which ultimately leads to his fate. We get the introduction of the films crazy creature a Sh!t Weasle now these FY&amp;Ker's are some of the most cool and unique looking monsters ever committed to a film. Jonesy gets posed by Mr.Gray I guess the king Alien. Then the film goes on to take you out the friends and their Alien encounter story to a Military trying to solve the Alien invasion film with some great moral and ethical conflicts between Morgan Freeman rightfully hamming it up and Tom Sizemore oddly being the more sane one of the two.Their conflict arises when they have to sacrifice some innocent human beings in order for humanity's fate.Now I love this part not only is it both Chessy and Serious at the same time but it doesn't make Morgan Freeman's character into a evil son of a bitch as most films would do it makes him be realistic,sympathetic &amp; a generally well rounded opposer to the Military sub-plot. We then return to Pete's encounter with a Sh!t Weasle not as OMG spectrally scary like when Beaver encountered his but still pretty impressive.Then we see the passed Jonesy using Pete a a tour guide but also as his first intended host for his Sh!t Weasle he plans on using but he got cocky and got killed. The film than features H finding the abandon place of the Sh!t Weasles home as he gets his encounter.Then he flees the scene then we get another flashback. Jonesy goes in and out of his form and a genuinely British ascent Mr.Gray also I forgot to mention the Memory Warehouse of which is pretty neat and especially when Mr.Gray is roaming around in it seeing the whereabouts through Jones's eyes. H gets picked up by the Military which leads to him going with Tom Sizemore's character and we get a few goofy moments like him and his gun call.He also get to know more about Mr.Gray and his plan of which is pretty scary.Then we get to see Duddits getting ready for his final mission.The film then shows us a great fight scene between Tom Sizemore and Morgan Freeman before the real ending of the film. We get to the ending Mr.Gray needs to put one sh!t weasel in the water supplies to effect the whole world and he and Dududits get into a mighty fine fight. Dreamcatcher is one for the books it isn't the horrible movie most people think it is.It features some cool ideas,great characters &amp; a nice blend between comedic and serious to make it worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible adaptation. Potential spoiler within is for the novel, not the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The book is one of my favourite King novels.... The movie is one of the worst butchering's of a novel adaptation I have ever seen. I don't know why they even really attempted it...the aliens were sentient spores, how are you supposed to convincingly bring that to the screen? I'm not a fan boy who needs everything to be translated verbatim, I understand that they're two different mediums and what works in a book won't necessarily work in a film. However, they made changes to this that were unnecessary regarding character traits, attitudes and demeanor. They were swapped around between the four boys as adults as if they were built from Lego blocks or something. They were four fully realized, interesting, unique individuals in the book, the film deconstructed them, shook them up and put them back together as if from a grab bag. It was pointless and did nothing to serve the film in a positive way. They should have been left as is so the writers could concentrate on a better depiction of alien spores and satisfying resolution. Looking at the resumes of the two screenwriters for this, I'm amazed it was such a steaming pile of sh!t. Makes me wonder how much the studio stuck it's nose in to screw it up. I've given it three stars but one is for the great cast that has to live with the embarrassment of starring in a movie that is only worth two, at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Attack of the Poo's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A serious misstep for director Lawrence Kasdan and writer William Goldman, this film boasts poo aliens and a screenplay which reeks of soiled silliness. Poor creature effects and a slightly bloated length are just extra doses of pain to add to the screw ups of this list of genuine talent involved. Based on Stephen King's worst story, Goldman's pen couldn't have created a well balanced screenplay if he was in the best of moods. This couldn't have looked good on paper, it didn't even look good on Stephen King's paper. A choppy plot and a feeling of endlessness come together to bring any audience a waste of time and brain cells. In conclusion, if Lawrence wants to adapt a Stephen King story, he should choose wisely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher (2003): Dir: Lawrence Kasdan / Cast: Morgan Freeman, Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Donnie Wahlberg, Damian Lewis: Title regards an Indian ornament that hangs in a cabin made by a group of friends who claim that it will keep the nightmares away. It would be great if it would work on this film but here I am dealing with its nonsense. It regards facing fears as four psychic friends assist another psychic who is being bullied. After venturing to a cabin in the forest they notice animals of different species herding together as if trying to escape something. They encounter two frozen individuals bloated with gas, and as ridiculous screenplays go an eel-like creature with rows of teeth emerges from the victim's ass. Intriguing setup that becomes a series of graphic deaths until concluding upon idiocy. Lawrence Kasdan directs with fine production but Morgan Freeman is laughable as a man out to stop aliens. Freeman is a respectable actor but the joke is on him here as he is at his worst. Other foolish performances come from Thomas Jane, Jason Lee and Donnie Wahlberg. Did any of them actually view this travesty as a big career move? This is one horrid dream that nobody this side of an alcoholic breakdown desires to have to deal with as a career move again. Rather than concentrate on the nightmare elements, the screenwriter basically dumps it in the toilet. That is what should be done with the film. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason I could tell what was going on in the movie was because I read the book three weeks before seeing it.The book itself is terrific, and for me it's one of Stephen King's best ever. The plot is amazing, and you can't get your hands off it.The movie, on the other hand, wasn't good. You could not understand what the story was about, and don't get me started on the things they put on the film in order to contain the story in only 2 hours! The first hour was faithful to the original plot, but the other half was just nasty, not-at-all helpful chapter choosing for the book, while adding effects and not-in-the-book-or-the-original-storyline things and scenes.Not good. Read the book, don't consider watching the movie..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2, because Jane and Olyphant are appealing to look at. Minus 8 for...well: - Wretched, wretched dialogue. I know King didn't write the screenplay, but it reeks of his 'style'. More exactly, it's how he imagines hip, cool guys talk. You know, with references to Scooby-Doo, and referring to a seemingly injured woman as, 'Ms Road Kill'. - Nonsensical story, utterly unrelated to a dreamcatcher. I like horror. I like sci-fi. But it's got to make SOME sense, people. - Morgan Freeman. I know he's loved, but I don't get it, and his typical, dour awfulness suits this clinker. - Most unrealistic idea ever, ever, ever: dude is sitting on commode seat because there is an alien beastie of some kind wanting out. Dude knows this. Buddy of dude GOES TO GET TAPE from an outside shed. Not anything heavy to place on the lid like, say, from the next room, but tape from the shed. Meanwhile, dude on seat has a toothpick fetish. He spies one nearby on a clean tile in the disgusting bathroom, and such is his mania to have a toothpick in his mouth, he...that's right. When the most hardcore crack addict would not have eased up on that seat to reach for a pipe. - All in all, really sad and unintentionally funny. Once again, a King adaptation rivals the others in crumminess. And the competition (see my reviews of 'Rose Red' and 'Langoliers') is fierce.</fullReview>

Case in point, The Stand, The Shinning,Doris Calbane(may have spelled that wrong) Misery,It.Perfectly pulled off. Along with Christine and fire- starter and Carrie. Not so good dream-catcher. It just did not seem to grasp the relationship the book did. Hope the Dark Tower is done right. As always I'm skeptical about Stephen king books when adapted for the screen until I watch them.

		<shortDescription>Decently diverting sci-fi horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King's sci-fi horror follows four friends (they may as well be the Stand By Me gang, All Growed Up) on a hunting trip in Maine. They've been sharing a secret since they were kids, and it comes to the fore when their log-cabin hideaway turns out to be hiding a secret of its own? There's monsters of course ? in both alien and human form ? but it's the interplay between the best-buddies that most captures the imagination here. A good deal of the dialogue is lifted verbatim from the novel, and the end result is a convincingly natural script that even a stickler like King should be happy with. Thomas Jane and Damien Lewis stand out as the leads, and Morgan Freeman's worth noticing in an against-type bad-guy role. Timothy Olyphant, Jason Lee and Tom Sizemore are fine in their supporting roles, and Donnie Wahlberg impresses in the final scenes. As for the aliens themselves, they're not bad but nothing new. Don't watch this film if you want to be scared stiff, but if you just want to be entertained, well, you could do a lot worse. 3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the feeling that I should have read the book before watching this movie. I also had the feeling that I was watching one movie and then someone suddenly changed the movie Finally, I had the feeling this movie was far too long. And it was right in all instances.I didn't read the book, and just like with "Akira" I finished the movie with the feeling that this feature tried to give us everything that was in the book condensed into "only" what it seemed to me like a million minutes, and failed. The main problem seems to be that you have two intertwined stories that could work on their own. One of the stories (let's call it "magic powers") could have perfectly work without anything but two minutes of the second (let's call it "creatures"). And you could also have "creatures" as an action movie without the "magic powers".The movie is entertaining but far too long. Worse, there doesn't seem to be time to develop any of the characters, which is too bad since I believe all of them had such great potential. All in all, a failed attempt to what could be a couple of good movies, or even a trilogy.Key phrase: "What is with all that anal fixation?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tommyknockers meets The Deadly Spawn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a Stephen King adaptation that starts off great before descending into farce. The first half is a taut, outlandish, well-spun horror yarn with moments not dissimilar to THE EVIL DEAD as a group of men find themselves trapped in a remote cabin with a very unpleasant kind of monster for company. It's gruesome and yet humorous with it, featuring some nail-biting set-pieces (the bathroom encounter is unforgettable stuff) and decent performances from an ensemble cast. Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there.The second half transforms into some cheesy alien invasion type wannabe sci-fi epic, with characters lost in the morass and the talents of both Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore wasted as military types. There's a huge set-piece involving the army bombing the hell out of aliens which utilises some of the worst CGI I've seen in a good while. Eventually it all ends with a fizz rather than a bang, with an unmemorable climax to boot. Of the cast, the four principal stars ? Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Timothy Olyphant and Damian Lewis ? are all decent, with Lewis performing particularly well in a schizophrenic, Gollum-style turn. There are some great childhood flashback scenes of the kind that King writes splendidly and some wonderful taking-place-in-the-mind situations, so it's a real disappointment that the film ends up so pointless and on such a throwaway note.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morgan Freeman leads an otherwise lacklustre cast through a sci-fi brantub.Endowed with the kind of eyebrows that could only be a spare prop from Hogwarts, he is some kind of unbelievable army bod with special insight into some aliens. These beasties are pretty grisly, and high marks are offered for their visual impact. There are also some nicely-realised set-pieces.That's that. The rest is as daft as a barrel of brushes. The flow is broken by stupid flashbacks relating to the childhood of several characters in the story, when they were school-friends. These arrive at exactly the wrong time, when the horror story proper is just beginning to smoulder (it never actually ignites). It seems they have special powers. I've no idea what they are; junior airbenders or something. The whole contrivance limps along like a cross between 'Dark Skies' and Terry Gilliam. The scenes in which an alien is having arguments with the mind of a body it has taken over are particularly crass.The best horror bits are creepy and shocking. The rest is laughably bad. The director should have made his mind up even if Stevie King couldn't.Not recommended. Though it could easily have been quite good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Stephen King's least successful novel is treated to an adaptation which doesn't entirely work.This is at its best - as is the book - when it is dealing with the four friends in the cabin on their group break. In both cases, the easy camaraderie between the four comes across well, as does the increasing threat when their unity is invaded by the "infection".And, as with the book, things fall apart somewhat when the military comes into it, the role of Duddits never works entirely successfully, and the denouements (the book and movie differ somewhat) are, frankly, both failures.But the movie is at least partly successful and even the unsuccessful parts aren't wholly unenjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Keep in mind I went into this movie with very little prior knowledge of it. My friends and I were browsing the video store looking for a good horror movie to watch. I happened to stumble upon this movie, and was anxious to pick it up, noticing that both Stephen King and Morgan Freeman were involved. I also remember seeing commercials about this movie back when it came out, and remember it looking vaguely interesting. To my disgust, we got a movie about giant worms coming out of people's sh** as they were camping out in a cabin in the woods during Winter, and then it evolved into some giant alien conspiracy, and I'm not even sure how. Maybe it's my own problem in that I didn't follow the story hard enough...all I know is that I was extremely disappointed, and from the looks of the reviews, I am not alone on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stephen King threw a curve ball to Lawrence Kasdan, director and writer of Dreamcatcher, and Kasdan struck out.The concept behind Dreamcatcher is in fact a very 'cool' idea, but is not totally executed in the best way possible. Miscasting, underwriting, and overacting plague this film, and it does lack because of it. he direction is mediocre and nothing particularly extraordinary happens.. But putting all that aside, there are some highlights. Jason lee as Beaver Clarendon is both hilarious and tragic. The special effects are also very good, and at times Morgan Freeman seems pretty darn nuts, which says a lot about his devotion to the character.Overall, Dreamcatcher is a very bland movie, but if you are a fan of the book, it's worth a viewing. There are good things, and bad things, but then again, it's only a movie. It's entertaining and for my money, that's all that counts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nightmare On Snowy Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late 80s and early 90s Freddy was at his peak of fame and notoriety. Kids were running around outside wearing stripey jumpers, mums were running around the kitchen with gloves, teens were running around sitting down with videos they were too young to watch, and all sorts of merchandise and spin offs were running around our shops and TVs. Freddy's Nightmares was an OK show, Freddy's Sex was excellent obviously, though Clean Your House with Freddy (and kill your neighbour) was a lowlight. Freddy popped up in a few other movies too- Friday The 13th part 7 or 5 or something, and The Goonies (if you watch closely). A Nightmare On Elm Street 8: Dreamcatcher was after all this and was meant to reboot the series, like Police Academy 6 did. Unfortunately Freddy doesn't do much in it- he hides in a toilet, and makes all the folks in the town dream about aliens but that's about it. They even hired Steve King to pencil the script for this, but even his genius couldn't save the day. Whoever wrote the original story was clearly an idiot and Steve King shouldn't sully his name being involved with such inferiors. I bet the staff weren't even Freddy fans, they just wanted to make a quick buck. There isn't even a strong female lead like Heather Mellenkamp from the earlier ones- you would think after the success of Buffy that every horror film would capitalise by having a kick ass heroin, but not here. We just get a bunch of men walking around in the snow. Some of the deaths scenes are pretty good, some of the best in the whole Elm street saga in fact, but that isn't enough to save it. I hope the next film deals more with Freddy than this one did. They should call it The Dream Executioner or something cool like that.Best Scene I can't think of any stand out scenes but I must admit the snow looked rather nice. It was quite realistic and made me want to throw myself into the fire.</fullReview>

There are several things that can be pointed out as reasons why this movie failed so badly: * Comedy-style sci-fi alien horror * You don't understand why people act like they do * The plot is hard to follow * It is childish on a grand scale * One of the roles is a mentally handicapped person, but this movie will make a large portion of the audience feel mentally handicapped as well...

		<fullReview>I have to admit that I do have a fond spot for this competently produced, but somewhat meandering and unoriginal horror/scifi. Maybe it's that as a former Alaska resident I have a soft spot for snow and nature? Maybe I like the unconventional approach to the subject matter? Maybe it was that I was somewhat surprised by the direction the story took? Who knows? This film overall falls comfortably into the trappings and failings of most other recent horror movies. The cinematography and suspense are top-notch with horror scenes so effective that they're often outright unpleasant (which is good, I guess?). However, the CGI and greenscreen compositing is typically omnipresent and as unconvincing and cartoonish as ever (with the turd-weasels as an impressive exception). Casting-wise, they managed to secure an eclectic mix of relative unknowns (at the time) who all chip in surprisingly good performances, namely Mark Wahlberg's older brother (and former New Kid on the Block) Donnie Wahlberg in a rare turn as an unrecognizable psychic simpleton.Unfortunately, large portions of this film feel completely ripped from earlier Stephen King adaptations. The snowy, tree-covered labyrinthine landscapes feel right out of THE SHINING. Most of the flashbacks to the group's childhood feel eerily similar to STAND BY ME and IT. There's a lot of King-ish elements thrown in - some work, some don't. The concept of the "memory closet" and being trapped inside a figurative portion of one's own brain whilst being taken over by an alien feels oddly fresh. Similarly, the military's containment of a horrible alien virus led by a very Conradian creation "Colonel Curtis" works well in what little we see of it. Unfortunately little ever becomes of the nice touches and overall we settle into familiar aliens vs. humans territory.I can see why this film is so widely despised as it does not represent the best in all things Stephen King. That honor would have to go to CARRIE or THE DEAD ZONE. However, as far as newer horror movies go this one is at least a little different and explores a couple interesting new concepts, leading me to call it somewhat underrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You will see, in a flashback, four childhood chums given psychic powers, after saving an apparently mentally retarded peer from some bullies. The four male-bonded teenagers grow up to be: psychiatrist Thomas Jane (as Henry Devlin), professor Damian Lewis (as Gary "Jonesy" Jones), car salesman Timothy Olyphant (as Pete Moore), and carpenter Jason Lee (as the "Beaver" Joe Clarendon). Every year, the get together at an isolated Maine cabin, to drink, hunt, and tell dirty jokes. Despite possessing obvious mind-reading and other powers (for twenty years!), the four are unable to lead satisfactory lives; instead of benefiting from their gift, they have a great longing to understand its meaning.Lawrence Kasdan's adaptation of Stephen King's "Dreamcatcher" splatters events from a very dense story all over the screen - sometimes it works, more often it doesn't. Despite his billing, the accomplished Morgan Freeman (as Abraham Curtis) is not the star; and, his last act makes you think he's an alien. Tom Sizemore (as Owen Underhill) is similarly underutilized. Reece Thompson (the younger "Beaver") sings a pretty "Blue Bayou". New kid off his block Donnie Wahlberg (as Douglas "Duddits" Cavell) pronounces "Mr. Grey" as "Mr. Gay"; elsewhere, the film retains some of the novel's wit. The "cabin toilet sequence" is a gross howl. Leave it to Beaver. ***** Dreamcatcher (2003) Lawrence Kasdan ~ Damian Lewis, Thomas Jane, Timothy Olyphant</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regardless of its critical roasting, Dreamcatcher is a must-see for Stephen King fans. In adapting King's epic novel (itself an amalgam of familiar King plot lines), director Lawrence Kasdan and co-writer William Goldman sacrificed much of the character depth that gave the story its crucial humanity, resulting in a tame fright fest about four longtime friends (Damian Lewis, Jason Lee, Thomas Jane, Timothy Olyphant) whose past--and a shared gift of telepathy--connects them to a present-day alien invasion in the snowy forests of Maine. Like an ambitious episode of The X-Files, this slick production offers slimy "weasels" that gestate in human bowels; ominous aliens who seize control of bodies and minds; a secret military strike (led by Morgan Freeman) against the invaders; and enough gross-out humor to satisfy jaded horror buffs. Unfortunately, it just isn't scary. Despite its A-list advantages, Dreamcatcher works best as a glorified B-movie, likely to benefit from lowered expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must concur with the former post... King books don't translate well to film. This one was a particularly bad adaptation. Jason Lee is cast in a role that should have been played by someone fifty pounds heavier and the crucial role of Duddits (which should have been a down syndrome case) is instead cast as a small redheaded child... The ending of the film is ridiculous and in no way follows the book which has an actual tasteful ending. Presentation of the "psychic powers" is also lame... anyone who read the book must have left the theater horribly disappointed, even for a Stephen King translation which we have come to expect to be somewhat awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, Stephen King is a genius story teller. The book was absolutely incredible, probably the best book i've ever read. The first twenty or so minutes of this film were very entertaining but from then on, it went downhill very fast This movie could have been made a lot better. if Kubrick was alive, i think he would have done a really good job, unfortunately he's not. :( Anyway, the conclusion is that it was interesting, especially in the beginning, but it could have had a much better script, better acting and it also could have been more accurate to the book. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher (2003, Dir. Lawrence Kasdan) Four childhood friends, Jonesy, Beaver, Pete and Henry all share a special secret. Each year, they take a trip into Maine woods. This year is different. A blizzard occurs, and they recover a man found wondering around. Unbeknownst to them,this wandering individual isn't the only being to be found. Now they must act fast to stop the outbreak developing and to prevent the world from its doom.I really enjoyed Dreamcatcher, but i'm sure that it's not something that everyone will enjoy. I haven't read the novel, and have no intention on reading it, but what the film showed me, would make a very interesting read. The special effects are very good but there at odd times, when they look a bit odd. There was also some scenes which seemed out of place. The storyline may complicate a few people but i definitely seemed to enjoy it. The film was fun for me to watch and i would happily watch it again in the near future."Pittsfield's a better place to be from, than go back to." - Gary 'Jonesy' Jones (Damian Lewis)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a masterpiece, but how could I not like it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: The more it develops, the more it gets stranger, yet if it's what you look for, you can't go wrong with it. (This is an extension of the review I wrote on May 2007)DREAMCATCHER is probably one of the most unusual and most bizarre films anyone is likely to see, and just about how many movies since or before has given us such a strange premise that involves four childhood friends with telepathic powers, alien invaders, one of the most disgusting alien worms since the Chestbursters from ALIEN, Morgan Freeman, military conspiracies and even Scooby-Doo? DREAMCATCHER has the makings for a disaster, and for the moment there, it might have been. But , though I'm half-abashed by admitting it, I sort of enjoyed this wonderfully demented movie. The plot may be a bit of a stretch (the more it develops, the more it gets stranger), but it gave me what I expect from a Stephen King thriller adapted for the screen: A creepy, spooky, bloody (albeit sometimes goofy) good time. Heck, I haven't even read the book and already this strange yet oddly entertaining bit of insanity makes me want to read it even more! This is not what the critics call a great movie, hardly it won't even be remembered from now. But still, it's not that bad a movie. It's a mess to be sure, but its an admirable mess because, even in such a silly premise, its creators can still go berserk with their wild imaginations. Admittedly, it's fun to see what such amiable talents as director Lawrence Kasdan, screenwriter William Goldman, and an impressive cast could do with such a surreal effort as DREAMCATCHER. The special effects are impressive, and the movie does move swiftly regardless of its overlong running time (134 minutes) and one might argue about the film's Hollywood ending (I haven't read the book, but the word's all around), and although it's hard to take the film seriously in some areas, Kasdan does succeed in several attempts to make audiences jump from their seats. I have to admit, I got a real kick with those butt-bursting alien worms and that iconic toilet scene. Seriously, I bought it. Sue me! Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not as bad as some people have said. About 90% of the film is well-done and true to Stephen King's novel (with minor changes). Acting is generally good, although Morgan Freeman's acting is occasionally over-the-top. I've read the book and feel the "Hollywoodizing" of the ending was ill-planned. Most of the negative responses I've seen on IMDb have been due to THAT alone. Good FX, generally (ILM usually pulls it off!).I'm not sure I would have wanted to pay six to ten dollars to see it at the theatre but I've added it to my movie collection.

		<shortDescription>Great movie. Nothing else to say.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first. It was a great movie. It was very well thought out and interesting. The only thing that was a bit too much was the alien parasites that crawl out your ass. They could have done without all the red stuff that appears when something is infected. Other than that, the movie was incredibly enjoyable. A must see for all Sci-fi fans. The movie was based on a Stephen King novel. The movie follows very closely to the book, however the ending does vary slightly, which explains why Duddits is sick in the end. I'm gonna stop there, if you want to find out what happens in the book, read it yourself, it's just as good.The way the character's minds were portrayed was genius. They took "reading" minds to a whole new level. This would have to go under one of my top ten movies. If you haven't seen, rent it. If you have, read the book. I highly recommend this movie, and I hope that you can enjoy it as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, but nothing too special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dreamcatcher" is somewhat disappointing, but there's enough to like to make it watchable.**SPOILERS**Years after being apart, childhood friends Dr. Henry Devlin, (Thomas Jane) Joe 'Beaver' Clarenden, (Jason Lee) Gary 'Jonesy' Jones, (Damien Lewis) Pete Moore, (Timothy Olphant) and Douglas 'Duddits' Cavell, (Donnie Wahlberg) have all settling into new careers and begin to fix the severed ties with each other. Going back to the cabin they frequented as children during a torrential snowstorm, they happen upon a stranger, Rick McCarthy, (Eric Keenleyside) inside nearly frozen of frostbite and complaining of being sick. Soon afterwords, a commando unit, led by Col. Abraham Curtis, (Morgan Freeman) and Lt. Owen Underhill, (Tom Sizemore) moves in, and finds they're fighting an alien threat. As they start to come under attack one-by-one, they race to stop it before the military takes out both sides.The Good News: This wasn't all that terrible. The film's best moment is the bathroom scene. As two of the group return to check on a man, they discover blood all over the cabin, leading to the bathroom. They then burst through the door to find their guest sitting on the toilet with blood everywhere, including on him, insisting he just needs to make some room before the alien evacuates and scuttles across the floor. They hear something drop into the toilet and then push the man off it. It's a really impressive sequence, being bloody, disturbing and quite original. The moment doesn't stop there, though, as one of the them, quickly-thinking, flushes it, slams down the lid and plants himself on it as the alien makes repeated efforts to force its way back up and out. The scene is simply marvelous in its cleverness, with tension-building cross-cutting to the other one searching desperately for duct tape out in the shed while we continually see the creature repeatedly try to break out inside. A marvelous fight ensues when it does break free, leaving blood all over the room and causing some quite gory wounds as well. When the other one comes in and is confronted by a towering alien with the usual big-almond-eyed alien head and the added accessory of the giant slug, now crawling around up the alien's alarmingly long limbs and across its stooped shoulders like a slithering pet boa, it simply ends it with one of the best ways possible. The main alien, the slug, itself isn't that bad, looking like a normal slug only to reveal its multiple serrated teeth lined up in a sack on the bottom of the head, gives it a nice appearance and it does look otherworldly at times. Also to be commented on is remarkable sequence where one of them enters the cabin and finds the entire places shows signs of the incursion, every surface covered by a dark, creeping red crud. It looks impressive on first visit, and doesn't really look all that bad. Otherwise, there wasn't a whole lot here to like about it.The Bad News: There are several things wrong with this one. One problem stems from the first act's pacing. This film takes forever to get anywhere. It sets up the four main characters at a very languid rate, which would be fine if that had anything in it that would've been useful later, since it drags on and provides nothing all that interesting. Unfortunately, it doesn't and makes the film seem like forever to get to the invasion. It also leaps from one subplot to another with such abandon that the movie loses any sense of flow or integration. Characters and stories disappear for long periods of time and then reappear awkwardly. To begin with, there's enough stuff through the subplots that shouldn't have been there to make the whole thing feel oddly disjointed. Aliens have landed in Maine and an underground militia groups work to kill the aliens and cover up the situation. A mentally slow man sends messages to his friends. There's lots of mind reading. A car accident and a body possession. It doesn't spend enough time digging into any particular plot-line long enough to flesh out the more fascinating ideas, provide it with anything remotely considered an answer for what is going on, and get us to a fully realized ending. It feels really tacked on and comes out of nowhere, then ends abruptly and all is well. It doesn't really provide much in the way of answers and comes as a very disappointing effort. These make it a really underwhelming film.The Final Verdict: Had this made more of an effort to be more thought-out and not as sluggish, this could've been halfway decent and one of the better King adaptations out there. It's got enough good ideas to give it a go, but those who aren't the most forgiving of King fans will find this to be a really trying film in between the alien bloodshed.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, mild violence against dogs and Brief Nudity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too gross to be great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The book was magical though gross. The film is gross but not magical. The novel was long, subtle, full of details and developments. The film is too short, too simple and one-sided, lacking too many details. We do not understand the deep political problem behind these military special forces that try to take over the US and are defeated by their very American prisoners just before these could be executed by those special forces, because all that is missing in the film. Here what we guess are the regular armed forces come in and wipe out the nest of fascistic soldiers. Sorry folks, the film does not believe in democracy and the right to rebel against the invader, even and especially if this invader is from inside. Was it not politically correct in 2003 to imagine some fascistic armed forces could take over the government of the USA ? Then the fact that the leader, the « boss », of these special military forces that are ready to kill Americans to save THEIR America, is black takes a very regrettable taste, flavor and perfume. In one word it stinks. The film is replacing the magic of the words and the intertwining levels of consciousness in the characters and among the characters with special effects but special effects will never be multifarious enough to embody the whole forest of imagination. We are reduced to a couple of trees, at best, if not only half a dozen of shrubs that are nothing but dwarf-trees. The rest then is unclear and in this shortened and simplified version it appears to be a paranoid approach of non-human life from outside earth dressed in the garb of worms with plenty of teeth, E.T.s with two big yellow eyes and other aliens laying eggs by the dozen if not the thousand, in other words gibberish 3-D robotized animated plastic models of common and standard visions of what monsters could look like. It is in many ways regrettable because the book, which is not one of the best by Stephen King, is a lot more interesting and even gripping and thrilling. Why on earth does Stephen King need to sell the rights of his books and short stories to people who do not have the intellectual, imaginarial and financial means to make great films out of them ? He does not really need money that much to let his own plots and characters be debased by the average mediocre and in the end greedy vision-less imagination of some filmmakers.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine &amp; University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drop your expectations and enjoy the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally watched this movie on DVD after hearing not-so-great word of mouth about it for a couple of years after it came out and now that I have seen it, I like it. Lawrence Kasden has made one of the better Stephen King movies. Notice I didn't say adaptations because I never read the book so I don't know how close it is or isn't to the source novel but, based on what is on screen, DREAMCATCHER is an enjoyable, if a bit lengthy sci-fi/horror film. Kasden is a fine filmmaker based on seeing SILVERADO and BODY HEAT and a good screenwriter so I figured the movie would be well-made and it is. Photography is nice and the snow-covered settings are beautiful, lending an attractiveness to the film in spite of it's darker side. I didn't care so much for the score by James Newton Howard because it had more of a rock-beat than I prefer but he is an excellent composer most of the time. The film sets up the characters and storyline and keeps up the tension well.*POSSIBLE SPOILERS* There are more special effects than I thought there would be and they are very good and very effective. Someone really wanted the best because they are from ILM and Rick Baker protégé, Steve Johnston. The design of the monsters is very good and they are quite disturbing to look at at times. There is a fair amount of blood on display and it kept me on the edge of my seat. The title may be a little misleading as it seems to have little to do with the story. This is really an alien-invasion story like SIGNS and perhaps the title is there to just keep that part a surprise. I have talked to people who don't like the ending of the film and there is an alternate ending on the DVD that was the original ending. I like both endings but don't mind the one that currently ends the film. It's science fiction folks. What did you expect? If you have not already seen it, I say that you ought to lower your expectations, kick back with a cold one and watch for yourself. That's what I did, and I had a fun time watching DREAMCATCHER.</fullReview>

The horror aspect of it is solid, with a plot that makes sense and some scenes that had me on the edge of my seat, and feeling a little queasy.Donnie Wahlberg IMO was miscast here. He really missed the mark and made a mess of one of the main characters of the film. His bumbling around trying to create this character awful to a distraction. I like Donnie, but this part just never came together for him, to the detriment of the whole of the movie. I found myself cringing as he clumsily delivered his lines in an almost insulting attempt to portray a mentally disabled man.7/10 though overall. I was entertained, the plot was good, characters bizarre and interesting and some very classic King scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the book prior to watching the movie and was somehow disappointed by the end. I didn't like the filmmakers idea of Duddits being an alien. The movie itself is still worth watching, as it has its good sequences. The story is very mysterious and exciting, at least at the beginning when you don't know what the hell is going to happen. The bathroom/shower scene is very good, poor old Beaver. It is a typical Stephen King movie, as many of his stories have these flashback-to-the-past patterns. Here it was nice, but lacked some kind of real emotional affiliation with the present. It could have been made better, no doubt. The boys are doing a good job, though to me they seemed to be too different from the book.</fullReview>

OMG !Like other reviewers - the film does start well and does seem to be 'going' in the right direction to get your interest, wind up tension and at least care what is going to happen. The four main leads are introduced - and we even get a flash back about how they meet a strange kid many years ago which forged their bond - one with psychopathic powers.However enter the aliens - and the film goes right down the toilet ! Less than dazzling SPX and what look like Alien's seldom visited relations really makes the film lose its tension. But there is worse to come ! Morgan Freeman is given a role - and lines - so bizarre and stupid that I wondered if I was watching another film- perhaps a take off the "Naked Gun" movies. His role as a secret leader of the "Blue Unit" whose job is to obiliterate aliens with helicopter gunships is just so laughable. Tom Sizemore - as his rival - is given nothing to do except to look menacing - and then 'Friendly' menacing.All in all an utter waste of time ! So even if you get this movie for ?2.99 - AVOID !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, Excellent storytelling and film-making! **** out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that is both horrifying and exciting. It's thought provoking and visually stunning. This is one of Stephen King's very best films.In fact, it's almost like Stephen King's take on 'War of the Worlds'.The first time I watched this was opening day. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't somewhat confused. It was a bit different from what I was expecting and there were a lot of twists and turns. I enjoyed it though. But upon watching it the second time it all fell into place rather well. This is basically a culmination of different sub plots. First and foremost though this is a movie about what happens when there is an alien invasion and these aliens come in contact with a band of psychics. When the two come in contact things get really weird. To me, this is an excellent concept and it is executed brilliantly in this film.Throw in a subplot with Morgan Freeman as a man who has gone raving mad because he has been hunting down these aliens for 25 years and you have what I call one of the best films of 2003.The special effects are astonishing. The one scene where this is most evident (and it is my personal favorite scene in the film) is where Morgan Freeman and a team of helicopters fly down on the aliens' crashed ship. Terrific score too. James Newton Howard provides what I consider one of his very best scores. It's both creepy and bombastic.The direction is superb and flamboyant. The story is told with a lot of style.A must see King film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About 20 years ago... When a group of friends:Jonesy (Giacomo Baessato), Herny (Mike Holekamp), Pete (Joel Palmer) and Beaver (Reece Thompson) saved the life of a mentally handicap boy by the name of Douglas "Duddits" Cavell (Andrew Robb). These five young friends shares a Powerful Gift, they cannot always understand. Now 20 years into the present-Jonesy (Damien Lewis), Herny (Thomas Jane), Pete (Timothy Olyphant) and Beaver (Thomas Lee) are men of separate lives and separate problems.They reunite for a hunting trip in the woods of Maine for their annual hunting trip. But then everything changes, when a stranger (Eric Keenleyside) arrived to their camp. There is strange going ons with this mysterious stranger. Then the four friends are plunged into a living nightmare and horrifying journey into the unknown. When the journey takes place through Hell on Earth and Struggling with a Creature from another world. Their only chances of survival is locked away in their shared past in the Dreamcatcher.Directed by Lawrence Kasden (The Big Chill, Grand Canyon, Mumford) made a entertaining Sci-Fi Epic Thriller with an often strange sense of humour. Which is Based on a novel by Stephen King (The Mist, Needful Things, The Tommyknockers), which the film is surprisingly faithful to the novel for 2/3 of the movie. Then the last act completely changes from the novel and becomes silly and confusing with an unsatisfying conclusion. The Characters of the Novel has been towed town for the film and some of the action/horror situations from the novel is missing. Especially after the defeat of Mr. Grey's character was much more interesting and satisfying.Dreamcatcher plays like a High Camp Version of "Alien Series" and the Superior Stephen King adaptation "Stand by Me". Lewis' Performance is good as Jonesy but when he plays Mr. Grey is played for unintentional laughs. Morgan Freeman is sorely miscast as Colonel Curtiss. In the Novel:Colonel Curtiss was originally named Colonel Abraham Kurtz (A Tribute to Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalyspe Now). But there is some good performances from Jane as the Suicidal Herny (Although his character made more sense in the novel), Lee as a Wise-Cracking "Beaver" and Tom Sizemore as Owen Underhill. Donnie Wahlberg plays the older Duddits, which Wahlberg is well cast in a small but important role.One of the highlights of the film is the amazing cinematography by Oscar Winner:John Seale (The English Patient, The Hitcher, Witness). A Terrific music score by James Howard Newton (Sings, The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable). The strong visual effects by Industrial, Light and Magic (ILM). Also excellent creature designs by Steve Johnson Make Up Effects Team. Dreamcatcher came close as being one of the most faithful adaptations of King's Works but failed towards the third act.DVD has an sharp Pan &amp; Scan (1.33:1) and Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer with an superb-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD Extras are a Four Part Featurette, Deleted Scenes, Original Ending (Some ways closer to the Original Ending in the novel) and Theatrical Trailer. Dreamcatcher is destined to be a Camp Classic. Screenplay by two-time Oscar Winner:William Goldman (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Hearts in Altanis, Misery) and by the Director. For the Die-Hard fans of Stephen King's work only. Super 35.

		<shortDescription>Read the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who aren't aware, this movie is the adaptation of Stephen King's novel by the same name. However, one must be careful not to think of the two as one and the same because that is simply not the case. I saw the movie before reading the book, so my opinion at the time was not affected by the original story. I left the theater thinking that it was an all right film, but nothing truly special by any means. The film's story is nothing to write home about; 4 guys find themselves in the middle of an alien invasion / gvt cover-up and are fighting for survival as both sides attempt to kill them. The only thing the film offered to even suggest that King had anything to do with it was that the 4 main characters all have some sort of psychic power, such as mind reading, etc. Oh and every now and then there are flashbacks to their childhood showing them meeting up with their mysterious and mentally challenged friend Duddits, who helps them to discover their powers. These things along with the all-star cast all have a lot of promise, but the movie simply fails to explain just what the hell is going on. It's as though the screenwriter had ADD and only half-included necessary story elements as he causes the story to bounce from tangent to tangent. On the whole, not a great film. But if you have watched it and enjoyed it at all, read the book! It is a truly incredible story, and it's really a shame that more wasn't done to make the film a better adaptation.</fullReview>

The challenges that King's novel gives, including stream-of-consciousness-like parts are turned down and ignored. What a mess.

I had read the book and although it was not one of King's best, it was an entertaining read. And I guess on some level, you could say that it was an entertaining movie. I didn't see it in the theater, it came on HBO last night. I do remember seeing the trailer last year and when I saw that Lawrence Kasdan was directing, I was intrigued. That was the only reason why I saw it last night. What a disappointment. Was this his "I needed money to buy a new summer home" movie? Lawrence Kasdan wrote the screenplay for The Empire Strikes Back -- arguably the best star wars movie -- Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Return of the Jedi. He also wrote and directed two of my favorite films, The Big Chill and Grand Canyon. I even liked Silverado. What a disappointment this film was. It seemed beyond Kasdan's league, this sci-fi dreck. I must have muttered five times throughout the entire film, "this is the man that wrote the empire strikes back." Don't waste your time on this one.</fullReview>

My recipe for a good movie: -Be original -Make it Psychologically scary as well as just plain horror movie scary -Add in a few laughs -Have a plot that's complicated and mentally challenging -Include some great friendships between characters -Make the WHOLE story come together in the end :)This movie followed the recipe and even added some secret ingredients. It is sci-fi / horror / just plain interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Film Of All Time!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can anyone in their right mind say this film was in any way decent? It was the worst film I have EVER seen. The dialogue was pathetic, the plot absolutely terrible and the ending unbelievably awful.The scene that still has me scratching my head as to how the green light could have been given for this trash, was when the man with the glasses (can't remember his name) was sitting on the toilet seat in an attempt to contain the monster. He drops his toothpicks on the floor amidst all kinds of blood and guts and he tries desperately to reach for the one toothpick that landed on a clean floortile. All this while the monster is banging on the seat in an attempt to escape, lifting him off his feet a few times. COME ON!!! Not exactly plausible is it? A man risking his life for the sake of a toothpick!!! Stephen King must have suffered brain damage after his accident and the producers must be round the twist as well to actually go ahead with this film. IT WAS AWFUL! 2 out of ten!!! PATHETIC!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher should have never been made for the big screen, more like the small screen like other Stephen King novels like The Stand and The Tommy Knockers. Films like IT was a great idea to put onto TV instead of the cinemas. I went into this film without reading the book and with the book being a bestseller and a few mates telling me how good it was I was ready for a great suspense horror film and what I got was 128 Minutes of complete crap. I didn't like the look of it from the start and it put's me off reading the book but there are a lot of novels that have been adapted into movies and the movies turn out terrible but the book is still great so I will read the book sometime with an open mind but there are a lot of people who will just avoid the book after watching this. Jason Lee was the only worthy character watching and he went out of the story after 45 minutes so I was left with an extra one hour and 23 minutes of something that should have been something but like a lot of films these days turned into nothing. If Dreamcatcher was made for TV then I think it would have been a lot better as it would have had more time to breathe and make the friendship between all the characters more interesting especially when they were young like they did with IT because you felt part of their lives in IT but you have no care for them in Dreamcatcher.Morgan Freeman as well, what the hell was he thinking, must have been a gun to his head to sign on the dotted line and the same goes for Jason Lee who was the only character worth paying attention to. I am not to sure at all about trusting Lawrence Kasadan anymore with a film because he directed Silverado and Wyatt Earp which were two good films but could have been so much more so I don't think it's the writer fault, more blame towards the director and the actors because they were awful. I can imagine the script was actually quite good but the acting in this film is more than awful it's criminal and you can't get worse than that.. There was no thought put into this and it feels like the film was rushed in parts to be released for Summer and that sounds typical from Hollywood but this goes in the history book as one of the worst films I have ever seen and most badly acted since god knows when and Morgan freeman is starting to look like an actor who will star in anything these days, it makes you appreciate his roles in The Shawshank Redemption, Glory and Unforgiven compared to the crap he puts out now. Warner Brothers really do need to start bucking up there ideas unless they want to be left on the scarp heap the same way Disney are going at the moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I read some of the user comments I see people blaming Stephen King for this piece of drivel. Don't blame him. The move follows the book loosely and many details that would explain the actions of the characters are left out. While Dreamcatcher is not one of King's best books, it isn't the worst. All I could say to my wife while I was watching this was "The book was better."If you must blame anyone blame the screen writers who took a book with lots of internal dialog and tried to turn it into a movie. Think "Dune."~~~~~BOOK SPOILER~~~~~ Duddits wasn't an alien. Kurtz/Curtis was crazier. Owen was a bigger turncoat. Duddits was more developed. And a plethora of other scenes were left out.Once again, take this movie as you will, but don't blame King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Happened?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher starts off as an interesting and ambitious movie about four friends that have acquired certain telepathic and precognition powers as the result of an incident in their childhood. This alone is an excellent basis for a film but the script turns from this intriguing premise into another "kill the aliens" movie. After watching this film fall apart in the last 45 minutes, I couldn't help wonder if the screenplay was written by a committee with one faction scribing the first half and another writing the finale. I must say though, I haven't read the book so I'm not sure how far off this is from King's original concept. It is a fact that in many of his books, he has a hard time ending an otherwise fine story (I.E. "It"). I also must say that the actors in this film all did an outstanding job despite the schizophrenic script. If the writing had been more consistent and the storyline not so jumbled, this could very have well been a sci-fi classic. If the subject matter does interest you, check out the DVD version for the original ending. It is far superior to the one that ended up in the theatrical release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pretty let down by this. After reading about it and checking out the gruesome pictures with the article, I was kind of built-up for a movie that was both gross and scary. What I got was a cheezball alien-invasion flick that was gross and funny with good moments of suspense that didn't compensate for the fact that I wasn't scared in the least. Did it work as a goofy splatter-comedy? Yes, it did. Do I have a special liking for those? Usually, I do. But the greatest scenes of the movie are the dramatically effective flashback scenes with the grown-up characters as children, the goofy, scatologically hilarious splatter scenes, and the "memory warehouse" scenes, all of which are negated by the rest of this mediocre film that outdoes "Maximum Overdrive" only in slight ways. If you take out the gore, toilet humor, and cussing, you would have your basic 1950s alien invasion opus. Don't get me wrong, the toilet-humored gore tickled my ribs like you wouldn't believe, and I know that WAS intentional. It works as a cheezy b-movie, but not as a scary horror movie. I haven't read Stephen King's book, but I know of people who have and, being avid readers of King, I know of no reason they have to lie when they say the screenplay for the movie took huge liberties with the original story. I know people condense things for theatrical releases (no one wants to see a miniseries-length movie in a theater), but the adaptation was obviously sloppy when this movie is almost a story all its own, and a goofy, stupid one at that. I have to be fair, though, because this movie serves a schlocky horror premise well and isn't nearly devoid of entertainment value, even if it could have been so much more. After all, it wasn't as bad as "Maximum Overdrive"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie on DVD, and now I sit here mystified at what I beheld. The first half was fairly faithful to the novel, but it deteriorated rapidly after that. I'm not saying the film should have been an exact duplicate of the book (since God knows there was certainly room for improvement in the novel), but I did expect the changes to make sense. While there were a few slight improvements over the novel, some of the best parts didn't appear to make the transition (such as Jonesy's tempting Mr. Gray to explore his new humanity, and everyone developing telepathy in the presence of the aliens). Sadly, I can't really rant about the worst changes, since they are pretty integral to the "plot". However, I can safely say that whether you have read the novel or not, you will come away from this movie frowning and saying "huh?".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Sci-Fi, Horror Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This exceptionally above average horror, sci fi thriller is intelligent, humorous, and clever. Morgan Freeman gets the opportunity to star in a role that goes against his usual casting type. The camraderie among the main male actors in this movie parallel's Stephen King's Stand By Me along with suggestions of John Carpenter's The Thing. The horror factor is suggestive of Psycho and the beginning half of the movie turns on the implicit fear and suggestive eerie events that eventually befall these characters.Unlike most horror movies, this movie develops its main characters so that any threat against them are emotion felt and the fifth male star of the movie brings a whole new element to horror/sci fi. The special effects are dazzlingly consistent and contributive to the movie, the cinematography and directing are sharp. The second half of the movie becomes an extended dramatic chase scene in which dark humor plays a part.While the death of so characters may have played against a successful box office turnout, in the long run, this movie has an opportunity to shine as a real contribution to the genre of fantasy, horror, and sci fi. The memory scenes of Jonesy are memorable for its originality and distinctive, off-beat presentation within the main setting of the movie.This movie is surely an entertaining, gripping, frighteningly, delightful sci-fi horror experience. Eight out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

It seems unbelievable and unlikely that people like Lawrence Kasdan and William Goldman could have written the script, based on a Stephen King book. The script is so unbelievably poor and stupid. My guess is that (very bad) ghost writers wrote this unbearable experience and got paid to remain anonimous. I have no guesses whatsoever on about how any resources were actually mobilized to finance the movie.In short, this movie is an insult to human's intelligence and an offense to any artistic values of filming.It is only sad to watch Freeman in this movie, trying to protude his "clever-looking" face to us, but only failing to engage us in such phony situation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Blame Stephen King!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many King fans, i was really anticipating this film but once again, i came away angry and disappointed. Can't movie directors ever get it right??!!Firstly i would like to say that i have read the book, and like most of King's, it is amazing and addictive and i couldn't put it down...absolutely terrific.However, like many films based on his novels e.g. The Shining, Dreamcatcher seemed to contradict everything that the novel contained.Like most Stephen King books, behind the main goryness or plain horror, there is the underlying themes of friendship and family values, ethical issues of race and gender, as well an analysis of the human existence. Where was this in the film???*SPOILERS AHEAD!!!*In the book, Duddits is 'special' because of his disability, he isn't an alien!!! That was just added for some freaky film value and to tell u the truth, i was more than enraged. Not only that but the film was completely terrible at explaining the friends' 'gifts' and why the gun was a phone. Not only that, but they seemed to decide to just change the entire plot at the end...i mean, i won't go into details, but u should read the book and just skip the film. The book is brilliant, forget the aliens, because it is the human ethical issues that are important...but that seems to mean nothing in Hollywood. The same happened in Kubrick's The Shining, however, although Kubrick dramatically strayed the plot, at least his film was well made and was just mind blowing in quality and acting professionalism...Dreamcatcher is sadly not so. It was confusing and just seemed utterly pointless. It didn't seem to emphasise the danger the aliens' presence brought, nor did it emphasise the importance of the friendship...it was just a cheap gore fest with a complicated, ill-explained plot.However, all i can say is...DON'T BLAME STEPHEN KING!!!! He is one of the greatest storytellers of our time and this film was just a diabolical attempt to cash in on his brilliant talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And so i went to see another film.Im really enthusiastic about stephen kings' work,so this naturally reeled me in to take a look, and BOY was i in for a treat. Normally,king adaptations are a hit and miss affair,with most of the recent ones' being misses unfortunately.This was a big turn around for the currwent trend.It has everything;A sort of "The thing" meets "Independence day".Its not as action packed,but the suspense,and laughs keep it rolling along like a deranged chimp on a bike.Going downhill. It begins with four childhood friends (all grown up) with the unique ability of telekineses embarking on a trip to a cabin in the woods.After an encounter with a stranger,things start to go awry.O.K,things go absolutely beserk,for what starts out as a slow burning,highly atmospheric chiller -The scenery is so lush,with its gorgeous snow scenes,i swear the temperature dropped 5 below in the cinema- An hour in and the whole thing goes in a million directions.We suddenly have an alien invasion on our hands,Morgan Freeman is thrust upon the screen as some hilariously insane alien-commando,one of the group develops a dual personality after a frightening confrontation with one of the E.T's &amp; goes on the run with a seriously ott british accent.You've got to hand it to the team who brought us this trashy masterpiece.I enjoyed every minute of it&amp;it throws up some really unexpected scenes.The script is top notch and witty,plus all actors(apart from Mr.Freeman,i know you can do better) excel themselves.It doesnt appear to have "cult" splattered all over it,nor is it a mainstream movie.Its some part of the King universe that weve accidently stumbled upon&amp;i like the trip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Same sh*t, different day."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ I was really into this movie...for a short bit. The beginning of Dreamcatcher has a very good feel to it that is sadly cut off mid-way. A group of childhood friends meet out in the woods for an annual get-together and some scary sh*t happens. I loved the bathroom scene (except for the fact that Jason Lee died over a toothpick) and that the aliens are called "sh*t weasels." Like I said, the beginning had its merits. Then the military comes in and kills the movie. I can't take Morgan Freeman seriously with those eyebrows and Tom Sizemore is a completely wasted character. Did they have to get Tom Sizemore? I think Sizemore is way above this. Some other characters that were wasted were Jason Lee's and Timothy Olyphant's. Did they need name actors to play these roles? I don't think so. These guys have talent and none were needed for these roles. Some King flicks are notorious for having two parts: the childhood part and the adult part. The childhood part is always expected to be great, like in It and Sometimes They Come Back. The scenes where our heroes were kids are horrible in Dreamcatcher. I hated them. In fact, I hated everything that happened after the military came in...except for two things. One) I did enjoy the cool sound effect every time Mr. Grey put his hood on. I don't know exactly how that works, but I really want it to happen for me. Two) I also thought the guy being trapped inside his own mind was interesting and was something I had never seen before. Other than that, the rest of the movie is terrible with the climax being the capper. Okay, Sizemore's character is on foot, wearing a black outfit, surrounded by snow, and going up against a chopper with a fully loaded mini-gun armed only with a handgun. He brings the chopper down too. If you don't see the error here you need to be slapped. And Duddits turning into an alien? I was told that's not the way it happened in the book. But when has any movie been exactly like the book? It would be nice if more King movies were based closer on the source material. Why does everyone feel that they can improve upon his stuff? He's Stephen f*cking King. You can't make it any better. He's the King of Horror for a reason: Millions of readers love his novels. Why must you change things? I don't understand it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Was THAT Ending?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the book. Of course, I didn't expect an exact interpretation of the book. That would be an impossible task. When the movie started, I was really happy. In fact, right through to the end I thought the casting was perfect. The four friends seemed like the average guys I read about in the book with the quirks I came to love. Duddits was right on target both as a child and adult.Somewhere around the halfway point of the movie things got lost. It was tolerable for awhile. I understood deleting the lengthy car chase because otherwise the movie might've been 4 hours long. Unfortunately that meant cutting out amusing scenes such as Mr. Gray's experience at the diner but I'll let that go. Then the conversations between Jonesy and Mr. Gray were almost non-existant. The movie really should've had at least one of the decent length exchanges they had in the book or something comparable. The book had a lot of psychological development. The movie had almost nil past the beginning. A tiny amount about the military guys, nothing about Mr. Gray.The ending was what made a movie with so much potential become depressing. All I can say is...what was that?! No psychological battle. No hospital room. If I hadn't read the book I might have misunderstood and thought that Duddits was an alien. Obviously Owen wasn't in place for Mr. Gray to be killed the same way he was in the book. Did they have to go in that direction though? It was pathetic. It was as if special FX decided to have a party at the end and tossed what was left of the plot into the trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huh?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Warning! Spoilers Ahead!**I knew very little about Dreamcatcher going in (I went to see the Animatrix short that preceded it and stuck around for the feature), except that it was adapted from a Stephen King book. It felt like it needed that large number of pages to fully flesh out everything. King's horror writing doesn't seem to translate well to the screen. Even with the too-long time frame, both character and plot development are missing. I hope the book does a better job at piecing everything together. Having said that, the first thirty minutes or so of "Dreamcatcher" were solid. In that time, the four main characters were introduced, as was their ESP-like power. Then the life-long friends unite for their annual hunting trip. That's when the weird stuff really kicks into high gear. Unfortunately that's also when the movie begins to unravel, as "Dreamcatcher" painfully transitions from a edgy, supernatural drama to a generic alien invasion flick. After a stupid and predictable character decision (Do you need toothpicks that badly?), the worm-like creature does its thing, and I was still into the movie. Then the tall alien creature was shown, and that was the official point at which the movie began to crumble. By succumbing to the urge to show the evil beings, director Lawrence Kasdan (usually reliable for a decent pic) robs "Dreamcatcher" of most of its tension. Instead of holding off for most of the movie like "Signs" did, he reveals the terror almost immediately. So instead of enduring an hour or edge-of-your-seat drama, you only have to deal with it for a couple minutes. From there, nothing really surprises or entertains that much, which is unfortunate considering that the movie lasts about ninety more minutes. Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore eventually show up as members of a top-secret military outfit that plans to eradicate the aliens. But nothing they do seems to fit within the structure of how the military actually operates. In an real-life time of war, the over-the-top nature of the script seems even more implausible and almost irreverent. There actually were two good things about "Dreamcatcher." The camaraderie of the four friends, which contributes to the quality of the opening scenes, seems genuine. All are played by well by actors that you know or at least recognize, but they are not stars. The high point (and only original part) was Kasdan's rendering of the inside of Jonesey's mind as a vast library. These scenes expertly displayed how the alien life-form invaded Jonesey, but did not completely take him over. But those two pluses were not nearly enough to outweigh the slew of minuses in "Dreamcatcher." Bottom Line: Unless you're a King fan, love the genre, or stick around for a free movie after the Animatrix short, skip "Dreamcatcher". 3 of 10. If you're intrigued, try the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a word, "The worst movie I've ever seen"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that Stephen King is perhaps one of the most gifted fiction authors of our time. It is quite easy to get lost in one of his many books and I, myself, have done so many times. However, I believe his works should strictly be left to paper, not the big screen. With the exception of Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" and "It", I have yet to see a movie version of one of his books worthy of the big screen. Like many of those who saw "Dreamcatcher", I was intrigued by the preview as a herd of forest animals ran across the screen in terror. In fact, the movie was quite good for the first 30 minutes(which is when this scene takes place). It goes downhill from here. As you meet the 4 main characters in the beginning and see their mysterious powers, you are kept on the edge of your seat in anticipation for an explanation of these gifts...instead we are met with bathroom humor(which gets ridiculous after a while), unnecessary amounts of gore, and so many twists and turns that you can't wait to get out of the theater. On top of that, Morgan Freeman's character is unexplained and useless. Isn't he at a point in his career where he can turn roles down? I don't think he's desperate for cash nowadays. The scary parts are quite humorous and my friends and I laughed through most of them. The movie has absolutely nothing to do with dreamcatchers and I'm quite certain it stole props from "Men in Black", "Star Wars" and the plot shows similarities to Stephen King's own book, "It." Those of you hoping for a drama or a good scare will be disappointed. The ending is not predictable, but the movie is made in such a way that you won't care how it ends just as long as you can finally leave. Do not waste the $6.50 to see this. Buy a new hat or something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Through and through "Dreamcatcher" is one of the WORST horror films I have ever seen! This overproduced train wreck of a film is neither scary, funny, and/or logical. Scares are replaced with just plain gross slime. This film became offensively bad when at the end a dog is infected and suffers in the process. One of the VERY worst films ever, and certainly the WORST that has cost soo much to make. Not one thing going for it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Complete Waste of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The IMDb typically has user comments like "this is the worst movie ever made!" Well, I don't know about that, since I haven't actually /seen/ every movie ever made, but I can say with authority that "Dreamcatcher" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the theater. If I hadn't been with three other people, I'd have walked out about halfway through. The first third is actually decent; before you really know what's going on. But by the time the first toilet-weasel appeared (they called it something else in the movie, but I'm assuming I'd be edited), I was beginning to have my suspicions.Sure enough, the movie took a sharp slide downhill right about then. I haven't read the book, so I can't say how accurate it was, but I sure hope Stephen King wasn't wholly responsible for the wretchedness of "Dreamcatcher." I'm also clinging to the notion that maybe Morgan Freeman only read about half the script, because I can't see why he'd agree to appear in this dreck otherwise. It wasn't even bad enough to be funny, in an Ed Wood sort of way -- though I did emit the occasional laugh out of appalled derision at its absurdity. Some of the "highlights" were the laser-shooting finger, the ridiculous British accent-sporting alien, and the unfortunately unforgettable "phone call" using a John Wayne pistol. I implore every reader who has not already seen this movie (and for that, I sympathize), to avoid it at all costs. Don't waste your 8 bucks, don't rent it, and I'd even advise against sitting through a TV-viewing. You'll only waste 2 hours of your life that could be better spent on other things -- like scrubbing your tub or mowing the lawn. Believe me, you'll thank me for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's rare when you can get a good Scary thriller from Hollywood. There's movies like The Ring or Mothman Prophecies or The Others which are few and far between and then theres movies like this which probably tried to make a good movie but missed. This movie starts out good and has good potential and then about 30 minutes in we are introduced to one plot contrivance after another and the characterizations are put on hold for gore and a plot that doesnt make sense. What's so surprising to me is that Lawrence Kasdan who wrote and directed my favorite Movie The Big Chill and wrote The Empire Strikes Back and Silverado had anything to do with this movie. I am looking for someone to blame for this fiasco because it was truly a horrible experience. Do we blame King, who Ive always felt is overrated in the first place, and his source material? Was he so drugged out after his accident a few years ago that he didnt know what he was doing? If you think this might be one of those cheesy B-movies, it's not even that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a classic case of the first thirty minutes of setup being particularly enjoyable... then we spend the next hour-and-forty-five minutes trying to tell a story that takes much longer. What you get is a silly, incomprehensible mess.The effects were passable, but the acting was awful. It reminded me (cinematically) of The Haunting. A real waste of time and money. Wait for DVD rental if you simply must see it.And I was so embarrassed for Morgan Freeman. When he's good, he's great; when he's bad, he's awful. I hope never again to hear him say in that low, guttural tone of his, "Now let's go kick some ass!"If you do go to see it, stay for the Animatrix short movie (quite neat, frankly) and stay for the first thirty minutes. After the first scene with a non-natural creature -- leave. Personally, I stayed because I never leave a movie early. But this thing, ratings-wise, went from 8 to 7 to 5 to 4 *really* quickly. In fact, I counted seven walkouts (one through the emergency door, no less!).Sometimes King translates well (i.e., Misery, Shawshank Redemption, The Shining), but this heap of a mess of a pile of unintelligible garbage should be skipped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank God no-one will ever make fun of Battlefield Earth again! This is quite possibly the worst movie ever made.The humor was entirely dependent on the human gastro-enteric system, and the dialog was excruciating (long drawn out discussion of one of the character's penis using the crudest language that made the actors themselves squirm visibly in embarrassment) and any movie where the bad guy can be summed up as "The Dick-Eating Ass-Monster from Outer Space" will elicit more howls of laughter than screams. However, I did learn some useful things from this movie: 1. Evil creatures from outer space will either give you gas or a british accent. 2. In the event that an Apache attack helicopter attacks you in a strafing run, you must stand directly in the path of the bullets if you really want to appear manly. 3. It is possible to bring down said attack helicopter with a handgun. 4. You can be psychic and able to "know things", but you won't know when the person you are talking to is dead and the Ass Monster From Outer Space is about to attack you. 5. You can take a bunch of really terrific actors (Morgan Freeman, Damien Lewis, Donnie Wahlberg (giving a performance that mentally challenged people will be embarrassed over for years) and put them in a movie and it will still suck (cf 'Gone in 30 seconds'). On the plus side, you will have hours of fun telling your friends just HOW awful this movie is over several beers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS!! This movie started out really good. The opening credits were incredible. There were a lot of beautiful camera shots and the scenery was simply amazing. It was really good until that stupid guy showed up. Seriously, the movie then immediately took a nose dive. I still can't figure out why this stupid movie is even called Dreamcatcher. I wonder what the hell Stephen King was thinking when he wrote this. He must have asked some 9 years olds what he should put in his crappy book. And they responded "Let's have aliens come out of people's butts! tee hee hee" Now don't get me wrong, Stephen King is a great writer but this movie was worse than any b-movie I've ever seen. I'm still not sure what this damn thing was even about. Was there even a plot? Why did Mr. Gray have an English accent? What was with them twirling their fingers? That had nothing to do with the movie at all. And these all mighty and intelligent aliens can travel across the galaxy to find earth but fail to be able to locate a highway. So stupid... And the whole point was for the aliens to find water or something, why didn't they just land in some water, or by some water? Oh wait, then the movie would've been about 2 minutes long and maybe even good. Instead, the director decided to waste 2 hours of my time. This was the worst movie I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>^SPOILER Warning^ in the following paragraph.I have read the book Dreamcatcher, and am quite a fan of the writing. So, naturally, to learn that the Stephen King's majestic novel was to become a movie, i would be excited. But this movie is nothing to be excited for. It begins okay, the characters cannot be shown as deep as they are in the book because Stephen King relies on thoughts and mental images to develop characters. Eventually, it progresses into a pretty good movie. Beaver, like in the book, is hilarious. But after his death and the death of Pete all goes wrong.The movie completely skips the riot of citizens at Gosselin's. They are left to live and stay happy and healthy. 'The Chase' chapters have been cut into crap, with Kuntz riding a helicopter to finally shoot Owen Underhill down.And, worst of all, Duddits is an Alien. After being pinned down by Mr. Gray (who looks he was cut from the movie 'ALIEN'), Duddits bursts from his Down Syndrome boy 'clothing' and reveals he is an alien. He then battles Mr. Gray and stabs him, leading to his death. While watching this scene I wasn't sure to laugh or to cry.Read the book. Please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider watching this movie the most wasted 2 hours I have had for a long, long time. I would give -4 stars for this if I was forced to do some rating. The only other movie I have seen recently that comes even close to this in total awfulness is 'Hells Angels On Wheels', tho I think this wins hands down with its completely insensible plot.First few minutes, half hour, even more I was fascinated how it was not possible to figure out what it is thats going on in there.. later I had to witness there were so many questions left unanswered, so many flashbacks not connected to anything, so many viewpoints with nothing common whatsoever. Fortunately the director finally figured out a way to wrap it all, by picking an alien invasion theme from the deus ex machina backpocket, and finished everything with a boring, unintendedly and uncomfortably comical cliché horror plot.So the first half of the movie turns out to be a mess of leads that eventually lead nowhere, and the other is an horror movie of class like 'The Return Of The Blob'. Without the aura of an old B-class horror movie of course.It looks like King has had his say of directing here, didn't check how much, but for the all humanity please let him stay away from the movies now and forever. He may write well but his taste of cinema is something I would not recommend to my aquarium fishes. Or their food, for that matter.</fullReview>

But this movie i thought was excellent. It was a cross between a horror/science fiction and a slight comedy, and it pays off. I disagree with every person who says the acting is bad in this movie and for those that bag the script are kidding themselves. I read one post that said they want their time back after watching the film. yet they take the time to write their useless opinion on here. There is no point in bagging a movie on the whole it is pointless. The film was well directed, with good cinematography and there is nothing needed with the script. the CGI shots are average but it really is a very good movie not an epic or a magnificent movie but a very strong entry into a genre that is severely lacking in originality. the snow setting is also perfect for this film and is well shot. and duddits doesn't have down syndrome in the movie for those that thought he does. a great movie a 7 not a 5!</fullReview>

There are two types of films that run for that long: the ones that make you wish they'd get on with it after an hour and the ones you're surprised to find they're over. Dreamcatcher is from the latter category. This story provides good entertainment for those two hours, without becoming boring or tedious for even one second. We do not get too much or too little of anything.Of course, in an adaptation, some things will inevitably get lost. This one, however, stayed remarkably true to the book, something which cannot be said of all King adaptations.No matter how good this adaptation is, the book is better, as always.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expecting to see a good, solid thriller? Dream on...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You absolutely WON'T hear me say that Stephen King is a bad or untalented author but, come on people, the man is definitely overpraised! I mean, if he'd write a simple grocery list down on a piece of paper, I bet directors would stand in line begging to make a film out of it. "Dreamcatcher" is a fine example to state this and I sincerely doubt it ever would have reached the theaters if King's name hadn't been attached to it. The story is unoriginal, mediocre, largely incoherent and yet Hollywood immediately had a big budget and eminent names ready to produce a film version. The result is easily one of the worst thriller/horror films of the new Millennium so far. Decades of King experience taught us that his movie-adaptations are the most effective and creepy when they're straightforward and not overly mysterious, like "Carrie", "Stand By Me" or the downright petrifying "Misery". "Dreamcatcher" is the exact opposite of this. Scriptwriters William Goldman and Lawrence Kasdan desperately attempt to uphold the mystery elements until the very end and the whole film eventually raises a numerous amount of questions instead of bringing clarity. On top of that, it's ridiculously implausible, badly acted and stuffed with schlocky yet redundant gore scenes. Four thirty-something buddies, "blessed" with bizarre psychic powers since their childhood acquaintance with a peculiar kid called Duddits, come together for a hunting trip in the winter-wonderland of Maine. Their cheerful childhood memories are brutally interrupted when the world is threatened to be destroyed by evil aliens that spawn from people's asses. Yes, you read that right! It's never really explained what planet they come from (if any) or why they opted for this snowy location to invade earth, but they surely seem to hold a grudge against people. The presence of Henry, Jonesy, Beaver and Pete can't be a coincidence and it looks like it's up to their special powers to save humanity, even though the angry army Colonel Curtis (Morgan Freeman) circles around the aliens in his helicopter as well. With a runtime of no less than 134 freaking' minutes, "Dreamcatcher" is at least half an hour too long! Although the best and most atmospheric parts of the movie, the introduction sequences and flashbacks feature way too many unnecessary details and sentiment. The sudden chance from tacky drama into gruesome Sci-Fi horror is difficult to stomach and the climax (which is a combination of both) is rather idiotic. The four main actors (Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Timothy Olyphant and Damian Lewis) try their hardest but fail, whereas the more experienced stars like Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore give away terribly wooden performances, like they're the only ones realizing the whole film entirely sucks. Not the least bit recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher is an outstanding alien film and yet another great story from Stephen King! Morgan Freeman was excellent and I liked his eye brows! The way acted and looked reminded Me a lot of R. Lee Ermey! Thomas Jane, Tom Sizemore were very good,Damian Lewis and Timothy Olyphant were good. Donnie Wahlberg looks so different its hard to recognize him! I couldn't help but think that Jason Lee looked just like Matthew Broderick in the movie. I guess it was the glasses he wore and his hair style. The rest of the cast was good as well! Like most Stephen King stories Dreamcatcher is a bit hard to follow and it wasn't predictable at all! The aliens were awesome looking. There is a lot of action in the film and it has some shocking moments. The scenes with the animals was simply incredible! I thought the aliens looked awesome!

		<shortDescription>Possibly the worst film ever put on the big screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a utter trash of a movie and how talents like Morgan Freeman and Damien Lewis got involved in this we will never know.The plot is about some aliens or something with freaky weasels mixed in but that's all I can remember to be honest as it went off after about 30 minutes as I felt it was stupid,over the top and felt like the actors weren't being serious even though its meant to be a serious horror movie,it felt more like a spoof.So glad the actors in this have done classic films and TV work as they wouldn't have careers if they were in films like this all the time.Quite possibly the worst film that has been shown in a cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring and Thought Provoking; Ahead of its Time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say I haven't been this intrigued, shocked and pleasantly surprised by a film for many years. For me this shone as a brilliant and daring attempt to do something a bit wacky and different which might have been more acceptable if made in today's cinematic industry. This film reminds me of some of my favorite Philip K Dick novels in particular; Dr Blood Money or What Went on After the Bomb. It mixes some themes that Dick is very at home with; psychic powers, mental illness, drama and unlikely relationships. Generally something that makes your head hurt but ends in a brilliant and unpredictable climax. Ultimately Dreamcatcher is a thinking mans/womans film and I am sure it would have been badly marketed at the time, probably to appeal to King fans who are into the other more acceptable King adaptations like IT, Pet Cemetery or Shawshank Redemption, which all stay within the typical limitations/stereotypes of their genre. Here Stephen King perhaps even influenced by Philip K Dick or similar 70's and 80's sci fi authors has combined several genres thus throwing the viewer off guard even to the point that it has comedic scenes. I love this, but I appreciate how hard it probably was to write into a lucrative picture or market to the correct audience. I think die hard sci fi fans will enjoy this more than King fans. I hope that this film somehow lasts the tests of time and gains a cult following. I will never be able to forget it, it's truly unique and a beautiful attempt at creating something massive and all consuming, using techniques and characters we usually associate with a different style of delivery. This is both its downfall and brilliance hence only 8/10. Love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hated this rotten piece of crap movie,Steven King how could you hate the natives that much.To take something that important,and spiritual and trash it like that.The use the dream catcher is to catch bad dreams and then throw it into the wind. And hope that it does not come back and if it does come back ,hopefuly all of the bad dreams will be gone. That is my mom's take on this awful movie, mine is I agree he shouldn't had made this movie ! Because if you don't understand or respect ones beliefs . And traditions either study it first. Or don't do it at all period , instead of making a mockery to what is considered sacred! To the Native culture, for centuries !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull adaptation of a lesser Stephen King work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit Stephen King is an author who has grown on me overtime. And I will say I do love some of the adaptations of his work, especially Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me, Misery, Salem's Lot and Green Mile and I do have a soft spot for It despite its flaws. While not the worst of the Stephen King adaptations, Thinner, Sleepwalkers and Tommyknockers are in my opinion worse Dreamcatcher is a rather dull movie I am afraid to say.In a way though, the book wasn't necessarily the most compelling work of King's in the first place. Intriguing, but lacking the complexity and genuine unnervement that was there in both It and The Stand. But Dreamcatcher, regardless of how good or not-so-good the book is, not only fails to convince adaptation wise, but sadly there is little of merits on its own.Dreamcatcher to be fair isn't completely redundant. The special effects and production values are excellent, the music is suitably atmospheric, the film does start off well and Morgan Freeman does what he can with his role which compared to how high-calibre Freeman is as an actor isn't much.However, less than half-an-hour in, Dreamcatcher falls flat and never recovers. A major problem is that it is very hollow emotionally and hard to get into because of the indifferent and poorly explored characters and (very) sluggish pace. The dialogue is mostly clunky, the storytelling and mundane and very by-the-numbers and the acting and directing are bland. But what really spoilt Dreamcatcher was the final act. Both It and The Longoliers had poor endings, but the ending here is close to unwatchable for too many reasons to list.All in all, dull and meandering film and adaptation. 4/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly interstesting movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow this movie really has it all. Acting,story and its really different then anything you have ever seen. I really like this movie mainly because of how original it was. Not to mention great acting with clever lines from begging to end in the movie. Like many Stephen King movies Dreamcatcher keeps a awesome timeline in a chain of events that will keep you guessing until the very end. I remember thinking how in the world does king come up with this kind of tale? Its amazing because the movie involves real mysteries like that of aliens, mixed in with social bonds with friends. It really touches on the inner fears and psche that we all think could happen one day. If you liked other King books turned movies such as Shaw Shank Redemption or Mist then you will no doubt liked this as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better King (horror) films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King is best known for his horror novels and stories, obviously, but most of the film versions of his novels usually fall short of the mark set by the stories they are based upon. Dreamcatcher, fortunately, can be added to the list of good adaptations, it is a character driven alien invasion movie that uses King's sense of the ordinary made terrifying and that creepy 'there's something behind that door' feeling to great effect.While not up to the standard of Frank Darabont's adaptation of The Mist or Kubrick's version of The Shining, Dreamcatcher can still be considered an enjoyable and thoughtful horror/sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent horrific sci-fi!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>O boy. Another controversial one, "hate it!" or "love it!" style.Going in, I expected "Dreamcatcher" to be another weak and insubstantial "Alien" rip-off with a thin story, which is the impression I got from the trailer, and the reason I didn't see it when it hit theaters. I only just saw it on DVD, and I was quite surprised. This is a thoroughly well-crafted sci-fi/horror/psycho thriller with many layers, great storytelling and stylistic consistency.It contains all the hallmarks of the Stephen King story, having loads of the same elements as movies like the excellent "Stand By Me" and the partially excellent "It". Lots of character development, all of which is ringing true and flawlessly engaging the viewer in the story.The story can be seen as pure sci-fi, with one alien species helping the Earthlings defend Earth against another; a great and not yet over-used SF plot. The story was good, effectively horrific and the best thing of it all was the characters, all of whom were portrayed superbly by great actors. I can't understand why any fan of these genres would think poorly of this movie.I rate "Dreamcatcher" an 8 out of 10. A couple of things were contrived (not to mention really disgusting), but overall I thought the movie worked extremely well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is more in this movie that meets the eye!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read and study the Word of God, The Holy Bible. After years of reading it and getting understanding through my Pastor, I have come to see everything through the eyes of scripture. However on the surface, this movie didn't illuminate any light bulbs until after I got in my truck to go home. It was like a bolt of lightning hit my head and I was revealed the underlining theme of the whole movie!Although, it was not biblically written, there were many Bible scriptures that backed up many of the scenes of this movie! And ironically, Duddits can truly symbolize Jesus' existence on earth for the sake of all mankind; here to save those TOO Blind to see the truth of Life! The whole born again principle was in this movie and is exactly what Jesus (Duddits) wanted, for the chosen person to die to self and receive a new beginning or a second chance to see life with new eyes of understanding! Just as Duddits called Jonesy into the street only to get hit and seemingly die was an alarming flag that said a mouthful! As a matter of fact, the whole movie said that mouthful and allowed Hollywood to say it this time, and not just the church alone!The Holy Spirit Rules this place!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stephen King's version of Brokeback Mountain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I was kinda interested in seeing Dreamcatcher when my friend told me that this was a pretty scary film. I watched it last night and I have to say that I was expecting these guys to get it on or something because they tried way too hard to prove their friendships on screen. I haven't read the book by Stephen King, I'm sure it's probably a thousand times better, but I'm not sure if I'll read it just because I think this is too familiar not only to other Stephen King movie adaptations, but novels as well. Dreamcatcher is just a movie that fell apart and had too much CGI along with the director who didn't seem to enjoy making this film.Pete, Jonesey, Henry, and Beaver have been friends almost forever, together they discover they have pretty special powers, that isn't well explained in the film, but there's special things they can do, they also help a young boy called Dudits, who gets brutally picked on. Their friendship continues for years to come, they go camping and end up with a very deadly attack from an alien life form that is killing everything on site. But when the guys are attacked, two are killed, Jonesey is possessed by one and Henry must help stop the attack from going on.Dreamcatcher had big potential, like a new version of The Thing for this generation, but it was too much CGI and more of a gross out horror movie that should have been more of a psychological one in my opinion. When I read that the director did this movie mainly because his mom told him too, I wasn't really surprised, because this is in no way the best Stephen King adaptation, wouldn't recommend it. The acting is bad and so is the script, I'm surprised at the kind rating it has on IMDb.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story that is engaging and interesting...only for it to be transformed into a kind of large budget monster movie towards the end...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamcatcher - 2/5 StarsREVIEW BY JOHN ULMERWhat went wrong in the second half of "Dreamcatcher"? Here we are given a story that is engaging and interesting, only for it to be transformed into a kind of large budget monster movie towards the end. It is as if all the characters go awry, the screenplay hits a hard block in the road, and the plausability collapses. Rarely has a film so withered away in the second half as "Dreamcatcher."The movie is based on the novel by Stephen King, a book I tried desperately to get into some months ago, only to give up a few pages in. It was a day when I had borrowed two of King's books from a local library and bought one, finally forcing myself to sit down and judge for myself if the much-hyped Stephen King lived up to his name.I bought and loved "Misery," but the other I read, "Cujo," was unbearably awful and stupid, and "Dreamcatcher" interested me but lost me with its odd sense of narrative. I won't complain about the 800-some page novel since I did not read it, but from what I can tell, William Goldman, who co-wrote "Dreamcatcher" with Lawrence Kasdan (and also penned "Misery" for Rob Reiner), cannot be blamed for getting lost in translation. The novel seemed messy, and Goldman and Kasdan's script soon leaves behind all hope, too.The movie's setup was incredibly interesting, which is why the latter half was frustratingly terrible. Our tale begins some twenty years ago, when childhood friends, named Jonesey, Beaver, Pete and Henry save a mentally challenged boy from a pack of bullies. The boy gives them a gift of psychic telepathy in turn, and all four men can communicate between each other "without picking up a phone."Flash forward twenty years: Jonesy (Damian Lewis), Beaver (Jason Lee), Pete (Timothy Olyphant) and Henry (Thomas Jane) all reunite in a log cabin during a blizzard in Maine. As fate would have it, a mysterious alien force is at work. A lost man shows up at the men's cabin, only to have a strange creature force its way out of his...well...bottom. The creature kills Beaver and an alien named Mr. Gray infects Jonesey. This is where the movie starts to get...odd.Jonesey remains inside his mind by locking himself up inside his Memory Warehouse, a subconscious warehouse visualized by Kasdan as a bunch of rooms containing Jonesy's memories. This effect reminds me of a type of "Alice in Wonderland" fable, of a man locked inside his own brain (okay, that wasn't in "Alice in Wonderland" but it's the same type of thing). It's interesting, but doesn't fit into the film. It's just too weird for what had appeared at first to be a serious film.The film features Morgan Freeman's name ahead of everyone else's on the posters, yet Freeman turns up belatedly in this movie, thirty-five minutes in (I checked my watch!), and utters his first real line fifty minutes in. Freeman plays Col. Abraham Kurtz, the "Good Bad Guy" of this movie. Freeman is usually a compelling actor to watch on screen, especially in films like "Se7en." There's Brad Pitt in one corner, speaking his mind, while Freeman stands there with watchful eyes, surveying his surroundings and really seeing what is going on around him. Not this time. He is one giant cliche in this movie, the hard-nosed military man who, along with the aliens, is a bad guy. He is the colonel who wants to kill innocent humans to eliminate the aliens, making his purpose justified but his means not. This technique of the Good Bad Guy always angers me, every time I see it, as I don't think audiences should be duped into having to decide between rooting for aliens and a military man. No wonder Goldman and Kasdan introduced him almost an hour in--I assume that Goldman, an experienced screenwriter, realized Freeman's character would not get the audience's hopes up if he was introduced any earlier. An hour in the audience can't very well leave as voluntarily as they would in the first five minutes.And speaking of the cast, Jason Lee was the surprise for me in this film; I hadn't really seen him before in any films. I haven't seen "Stealing Harvard" or any Kevin Smith films, so I had never really seen Lee on film before. He stole every scene as Beaver. Which figures, since he is the first killed. Tom Sizemore plays someone in this movie, who does the obvious and cliched, and he was extremely held back as compared to his usual self. Sizemore, who starred in "Saving Private Ryan," "Black Hawk Down" and other military films as far as his mainstream films go, disappointed me. It's the terrible script, and Sizemore just went with the flow.There's a boundary between great alien movies and terrible ones. "Dreamcatcher" started off as an intriguing character study of four childhood friends with a mysterious power connecting them. The second half turned into another horrible B-monster-movie with a larger budget. Reader, I tried desperately to figure out what was happening and where the plot was going, but after the one hour mark I started getting lost, and by the end of the film I still didn't know what was going on and, to be quite honest, I didn't really care.</fullReview>
