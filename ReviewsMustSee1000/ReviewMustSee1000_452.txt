		<shortDescription>Ridiculous...Entertaining...Delightful...RED is all this.!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Bruce Willis plays his indestructible yet on the surface everyday guy he is right where the audience loves him. In RED, "Retired Extremely Dangerous", he has a close to perfect vehicle. And, so RED delivers in spite of a fairly ridiculous scenario of a group of ex-CIA operatives,or which Willis is one, being singled out for execution on the eve of the vice-president announcing his candidacy for president.We get the message from the first that Willis is somewhat lonely and bored with retirement and is searching for a companion to make his new life matter. He isn't aching to get back to fast track, but is venerable and is fixated on a kind and cheery voice on the other end of the phone line when he complains about not getting his pension checks (he tears them up just to talk to his "handler"). He arranges a meeting with the sweet sounding gal just prior to everything falling apart because the CIA sends in a "wet" team to erase him. As suspected the CIA, as well as most all the resources of the government, are not up to the task.Willis reassembles his old team, all in his age bracket or older, in order to survive. That team, if not on the surface a formidable threat, is pure cinematic gold as it consists of excellent performances by Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren. It is almost impossible not to like this film because of the wonderfully entertaining supporting cast. In fact Malkovich steals the show providing the correct dosage of crazed comic relief. This leads to impossible feats making for deliciously served up entertainment; all with a "nod-and-a-wink" that cuts through the unbelievable. Great action with comedy! Richard Dreyfus turns in a solid performance as a spoiled smart-ass (uber-wealthy and powerful) arms dealer who pulls strings behind the scenes. And, Ernest Borgnine has a cameo role which is memorable.It's a character driven action comedy that truly is RED (ridiculous, entertaining, delightful). This movie gets a 7.5 and, as such, is hard to fault in spite of being pure light-weight fluff. See it and smile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John McClane, Cyrus the Virus, God and The Queen team up and kill people for laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A retired CIA operative, hunted by his own people, reunites his old team for one last mission. It's certainly not an original story, mashing together ideas that we've seen before in the Bourne series, The Expendibles and The Losers. 'RED' (which stands for 'Retired, Extremely Dangerous') is the 4th film this year to be adapted from a graphic novel. It is also the 4th to feature men going on a mission, and the 5th with a plot involving the CIA. I couldn't help but feel skeptical. But then I noticed the cast list and realised that this is meant to be a comedy. At this point I saw the project in a different light. 'RED' is a film in which John McClane, God, Cyrus the Virus and The Queen join forces and kill people for laughs. Clearly this was going to be a film where story and sense came second to cast and chemistry. From 'Die Hard' to 'Sin City', Bruce Willis' good-guy-having-a-bad-day routine has evolved little, but it does not need to be fixed. His performance in 'RED' is familiar, but he is never less than entertaining. This time he brings with him an air of self-parody. Throughout the film he maintains a carefree poker-face, as though he's done this so many times over the years that he can afford to be relaxed. There are valid attempts at making Willis seem more normal, and these can be quite amusing. The first 10 minutes, which show him adjusting to retirement and aimlessly wandering around the house in his dressing gown, are reminiscent of Carl Fredricksen's first appearance as an old man in 'Up'. Deeper characterisation, however, only serves to show how abnormal he really is, and it is a delight to see him in action.With the exception of Willis, the cast is made up of actors who have no business waving guns around. Helen Mirren was an inspired choice, as if making up for the predictability of Willis' casting. Flower-arranging OAP on the outside and bad-ass hit-woman on the inside, Mirren is strangely suited to action. There is something about the juxtaposition of her gran-like demeanour with exaggerated violence that makes her very funny and extremely watchable. John Malkovich is particularly entertaining in his performance as a mentally questionable conspiracy theorist who refuses to retire peacefully. After the numerous roles he has played with an undercurrent of insanity, it is hilarious to see him go full-on howling mad. It is not often that Malkovich gets to flex his comedy muscles, but he steals every scene in which he appears.Morgan Freeman is unfortunately the weakest part of this alternative A-Team, not because of his performance but because he is under-utilised. He has little action time and even less characterisation. There is a glimpse at pervy-old-man behaviour (which could have been funny) and a mention of health problems (which could have been touching) but these are quickly forgotten. It is as though the writers were distracted, trying too hard to develop a secondary storyline involving Willis' romance with a pension office clerk. This subplot adds little and distracts from the main picture. It is a pity, because the wasted effort could have been more effectively put into making the story tighter, or on giving Morgan Freeman more screen time.Overall, this is a good laugh, even if you won't remember it afterwards. Taking things less seriously and trying less hard to be cool means that 'RED' is more fun than 'The Expendibles', and less embarrassing too. Stallone can mumble all he wants about "shooting real action" - I'd rather see the Queen fire machine guns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What The Expendables was supposed to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for The Expendables, I was already thinking of the interesting and funny relationship between the characters played by those action icons. After a zillion trailers and a movie, I was sourly disappointed. Now, I don't know who's fault it is, but relative to The Expandables, I almost haven't heard of Red before its release. However, it was exactly what I was looking for.You have a great team of actors. They are not even action heroes, maybe that did it, but they do a great job. just look at that cast: Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Brian Cox, Hellen Mirren, Richard Dreyfuss, even Ernest Borgnine! As the young(er) crew, Karl Urban and Mary-Louise Parker are in it and they both play well. But more than that, each character actually has a role. They don't just come in, say a few inconsequential things, then die or are completely forgotten *cough* James Remar *cough*.So it had the ridiculously packed action and at times it looked and sounded like Ocean's Eleven, who cares? The rest was great! Even the fight scenes... not even the bad guys go out in full view firing wildly then getting shot. People actually took cover, helped each other and synchronized their moves. The lines were funny and somewhat complex and all the people on the set were clearly having fun doing what they loved.Bottom line: I don't know, maybe because the director is unseasoned in the ways of Hollywood the movie turned out to be so good. Or maybe it was the cast. Or maybe it was the fun of it. The movie turned out great, with a few screw-ups that I am ready to ignore. The mash-up is Jason Bourne meets The Expendables via, luckily for us, just a pinch of Ocean's Eleven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sooo much fun!!! See it in theatres with an audience!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You will leave this film laughing. The action scenes are really good but it's the characters and actors that makes this film worth seeing. The casting in this film was perfect! Great all around supporting cast. Morgan Freeman is always a nice touch to any film. Helen Miran firing a Rambo sized gun is worth the admission alone. If you miss the classic Bruce Willis Action Comedies this one makes up for all the bad ones in recent years. But what really makes this film worth seeing in theatres with an audience is John Malkovich! John Malkovich steals the show with maybe the performance of his career. If Johnny Depp can get nominated for "Pirates" and Robert Downey Jr. can get nominated for "Tropic Thunder", then Malkovich should get nominated for this, seriously. Every time he came on screen the whole theatre would be dying with laughter.Movies are expensive now and not all of them are worth seeing in theatre but this one is. It's not the best film ever made, the story could have been a little tighter, but I can promise you'll have a lot of fun and you will be laughing your ass off through most of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red is brilliant!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never thought much of this film prior to viewing it, as many others might not have either, but if you have even the slightest inclination to view this, you must! The story is typical, nothing special about the basic plot synopsis, but the delivery and the interesting plot twists keeps it fresh and interesting. The humour is hilarious, mostly a subtle humour that is apparent throughout the entire film, in nearly every scene.Bruce Willis, Mary-Louise Parker, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, and Karl Urban all excel, as would be expected. It is refreshing watching Bruce Willis star in another action film, alongside Mary-Louise Parker (the gorgeous mother in Weeds) no less. John Malkovich plays the paranoid role quite astonishingly and Helen Mirren firing large weapons, including a gatling gun, is amazing! Every name above plays an equal part in the film, which is amazing. I never had so many characters in a single movie that I highly enjoyed equally. Remarkably done with talent seeping through the actors and vividly portrayed on the screen. Don't expect this film to change the history of all films, but expect it to exceed in entertainment. If you give it a chance, you won't be disappointed. It's definitely a Friday night flick, something that is easily enjoyed.Brilliance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's a senior to do? Get a bigger gun of course</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You're wrinkly, have health issues and your age is higher than the calibre of your gun. So what's a senior to do? Why get a bigger gun of course. That is certainly one of many philosophies in the action comedy RED (That would be Retired Extremely Dangerous for those still living in fear of Communism. Hey, it is the right age bracket) which collects a who's who of Oscar-grade talent and has them blow stuff up real good. This is but the fourth men-on-a-mission film so far this year after The Expendables, The A-Team and The Losers, heck even Inception could fall into that group. The good news is with the exception of the latter it is the best of the bunch and by far the most fun you're bound to have this fall season. Now onto the CIA. I don't know what they're dipping their dirty little fingers into Stateside but in addition to being at the center of some ticked off senior's attention in RED, they have been the villains in aforementioned The Losers and The A-Team as well as Salt and Knight &amp; Day. Talk about your need for homeland security, they had better keep one of those high-tech satellites over Hollywood. At the receiving end of the Central Intelligence Agency's scope are a band of former operatives including the "kid" of the group, Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), the ailing Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), the brain-fried eccentric, Marvin Boggs (John Malcovich) and the sultry heartbreaker, Victoria (Helen Mirren). Brian Cox also shows up as a Ruskie who may or may not have been previously shot by one of the former. Though not having seen action in a good decade, they have been deemed "RED" by an unknown force, which means curtains for this rag-tag bunch of geriatrics. The cast truly is great in RED, and I don't simply mean the actors in general; they simply all give full-on great, funny performances. The subtle (but hilarious) underlying lament of these characters is they all reminisce over their past lives as hardened assassins and pine just to kill one more little ol' person. More at the forefront of course is the bang-on wry humour and delicious action sequences. This is old fashion stunt work at play here (fittingly perhaps) and I'll take it over a green screen any day. These bursts of adrenaline are dumb to be sure, but not totally ludicrous; think of a cross between Die Hard and Enemy of the State. What they are not is anything short of exciting and kinetic, and are interspersed with laughs in such a way as to not drift to one focus too long. RED also gleefully embraces its comic book origins, using playful transitions as the globe-trotting commences. Yet again, director Robert Schwentke never revels in one gimmick for too long and the film goes down smooth and easy as a result.The younger cast is more than worth mentioning as well, with the highest accolades going to Mary-Louis Parker from TV's Weeds. There is a joke in RED which I am not sure was intentioned, when after being injected with a knockout-drug, Parker's Sarah exclaims "I'm so high". She steals most scenes when given the chance but her character (a love interest of Frank who unintentionally gets caught up in the fracas) is utilized far more towards the beginning of the film. Karl Urban is also solid as a CIA operative tasked in finding the RED's but becomes suspicious at his orders which grow increasingly corrupt. I always wonder in the movie world how they would explain attack helicopters shredding an airport to the general public. The government must have some amazing PR agents on staff. Richard Dreyfus (in his second cameo of the year after Piranha) is also well used as an oily arms dealer who comes across the team's path.Summit Entertainment is pulling out all the marketing stops for this film, and I am happy to report the results seem to be worth the glamour. While venturing through my theatres ticket checkpoint they stamped my stub "confidential" instead of ripping it, and a squad of agents clad in sunglasses and suits patrolled the lobby. The showing seemed to be a generous mix of old and new patrons and that really comes as no surprise. Even though the majority of the cast has long breached 60, these are actors generations of all ages still admire. Even if they are not the draws they once were (some of them never were) this is a great example of people showing up to see actors, performers, and not special effects. RED may be imperfect, it may not even be particularly fresh, but it exudes something movies lack far too often: fun.playeraffinity.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to watch a preview screening of this last night. I should qualify that I'm a big fan of Bruce Willis especially when he plays this kind of character - a tough guy with a wry sense of humour.Really interesting mix of genres here - think action/comedy/romance rolled up into one. Just enough romance without being sappy, heaps of action to keep it exciting and the occasional comedy touches which had the whole audience laughing out loud.It's not going to win any Oscars but don't take it too seriously and you'll be taken along for a pretty enjoyable ride.Worth a watch - great date movie - possibly one to wait for DVD for...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't agree with the critics on this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red manages to balance the line between action thriller, and light comedy, and does it quite well.Frank Moses(Bruce Willis) a former C.I.A. agent is now retired, and living a simply, and at times boring life. His only joy of the day when he calls Sarah(Mary Louise Parker) a customer service agent, who he likes, Frank pretends not to get a monthly check, just an excuse to talk to her. But Franks simply life is interrupted, when he learns that somebody has put hit on his life, he goes on the run, after escaping an attempt on his life. He takes Sarah along too, much to her dismay. And gets his old team back together(Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich) in hopes to uncover who is behind the hits, but will they before it's too late? I really don't agree with the critics on this one. Red was entertaining. It's funny without trying to get overly silly. Action scenes where good. Bruce Willis, Mary Louise Parker, Helen Mirren, Karl Urban, Richard Dreyfuss, Brian Cox, and Morgan Freeman. But it's John Malkovich who steals the show, with his funny one liners. And also a great co starring role by veteran actor Ernest Borgnine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red completely justified to its Slogan "Retired-Extreme-Dangerous". Thumbs Up!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RED ? CATCH IT ( B+ ) Red completely justified to its Slogan "Retired-Extreme-Dangerous". The whole movie plays out really cool, funny and clever. In recent times Bruce Willis's movies becomes very cocky and senseless despite of lots of heavy Action, Drama and even comedy. RED is funny from the beginning and opening phone chat sequence between Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker gives out lots of dept and characterization. After that it's a non-stop roller coaster ride and we get to meet so many interesting characters one by one. Now let's talk about the great actors who actually made the movie work like no one has expected. Bruce Willis is at his best in RED, I think after Die Hard action franchise finally Bruce Willis got another action franchise which can be preceded further. Bruce's amazing wit, Sharp action moves made it really thrilling experience. Trust Me! Watching Bruce Willis coming out of the heavy speed moving car was just outlandish. You have to watch that scene to believe it! Mary-Louise Parker is adorable, after watching her racy/funny side on "WEEDS" from almost 4, 5 years; it's so fun to see her in Big Star studded movie with her crazy witness and attitude. She is really fun to watch, the chemistry between Bruce Willis &amp; Mary-Louise Parker is wonderful. John Malkovich is Hilarious; I never knew this man can be so funny, his moves, dialogues thus every thing was great, and he pretty much steals the scene when he is on screen. Morgan Freeman was the slowest among all of them in humor I guess, though he did pretty decent job in his small role. Last but not the Least we are introduced to Dame Helen Mirren, who just simply stole the show, seriously watching her moving that machine gun like a fire cracker is unbelievable. She brought the utmost charisma to the team of RED. The youngest cast member of the movie was promising actor Karl urban, his tux made him move like 007 &amp; he gave an utmost completion to the RED team, the best thing about Karl urban was that he brought freshness to the movie. Brian Cox, Julian McMohan and Richard Dreyfuss were good. Overall it's a fun ride which no one should miss on any chance. Watch it in first moment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Helen Mirren with a machine gun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Silly is the operative word but also very entertaining. What did it for me was the cast. Helen Mirren lifts whatever she is in and the endearing thing about her is that she's not "precious" She goes for it and her fun becomes our fun. Hurrah for that! To go into the plot seems an exercise in futility because that's not what we will enjoy particularly but Mirren holding a machine gun with relish, the wonderful Mary Louise Parker tied to a bed or Brian Cox with a Russian accent and a mischievous spark in his eye. John Malkovich, I hope he soon plays a woman, he would be marvelous as Edna in "The Edna May Oliver Story" He is such fun to watch. Bruce Willis can do this kind of film in his sleep and he kind of does and Morgan Freeman? Well, he's always worth the trouble. The film has already vanished from my brain but the cast is glorious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>imagine an over-the-hill-gang of CIA agents on a case</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just came from a screening of RED which opens Oct 15th. We were told that what we saw is the final cut without some of the special effects completed.The plot...Willis plays a bored retired CIA agent who amuses himself by calling the federal clerk who handles lost retirement checks (Parker) falsely asking for replacements (he tears them up) while flirting with her on the phone (could this be love?). One day he finds himself under attack at home. After taking care of the attackers he goes on a quest to find out why someone wants him dead.RED, stamped on Willis' CIA file stands for retired extremely dangerous. The movie is based on the graphic novel of the same name. Loads of big time actors show up while Willis is on the search for the killers. Some of them are other retired CIA agents (Freeman, Malkovich, Mirren). Then there's the federal retirement clerk and love interest to Willis' character (mary Louise Parker who steals the movie) and an old Russian KGB agent (Brian Cox who always does a great acting job). They team together to find out why they and others have been targeted to be killed. Helen Mirren as a hit-woman is a hoot. Malkovich is fun as an oddball ex-agent. Great cameos by Ernest Borgnine and Richard Dreyfuss. I enjoyed watching them all.I think the movie is meant to be a comedy, but the script could be punchier. I sat for long periods watching an ordinary spy movie plot unfold with few laughs. OK I was wowed by the actors but let down by the script. Willis is in his element. Freeman is underutilized but works well as part of the team. If you're a fan of these actors you might want to see the movie to watch them play together. They seem to be having fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess the people who found this film 'hilarious' and 'amazing' must be really easily pleased. I found it overly long, badly scripted, predictable and poorly acted. Malkovitch put some effort into his part as Marvin the paranoid android, err, sorry, ex-CIA agent but all of the other big names seem to have decided that what this 'comedy' needed was for them to ham it up. And Brian Cox was the hammiest of the porcine bunch.What's most disappointing about this film, however, is that the writers seem to think that because what they're writing is an 'action comedy' they don't have to bother trying to make anything about it the slightest bit believable. It's as if they think the word 'comedy' is code for 'will only be watched by gullible fools'. Thanks for the insult, guys. Now, can I have that two hours of my life back, please?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't been to the cinema much recently as for me there hasn't really be many films out that have caught my attention. The last film I saw at the pictures was the impressive The Town directed by Ben Affleck that I saw in late September. Red I saw in a trailer prior to that and it looked like terrific fun and was a film I was very much looking forward to. The 7.7 IMDb rating on this film in my opinion is a little extravagant and isn't really justified. It's for me hard to avoid the conclusion that the director Robert Schwentke just placed all the fun moments in the trailer for the sake of drawing the audience to the cinema in a way, but it isn't entirely true.The basic story starts off with ex-CIA agent Frank Mose's chats on the phone to Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) whom have a thing for each other when Frank is attacked by CIA operatives who attempt to kill him. He hooks up with Sarah and other retired CIA agents along the way, which include Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), Victoria (Helen Mirren), Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) and Ivan Simonov (Brian Cox) to try and find out why their own government wants to kill them. Whilst the CIA appoint operative William Cooper (Karl Urban) to apprehend Frank.The story is quite basic and the screenplay is functional at best, whilst there are some funny moments, the script isn't witty or sharp enough and that's where the film loses it's edge. There were moments particularly in the first forty minutes where the movie threatens to be dragged down by it's slow pace and mediocre script, but the film does pick up and get better later even if things get a little silly. In terms of the acting, Willis gives an okay performance, but I was a bit disappointed to be honest. He tries to sparkle but he just couldn't and it felt very run of the mill, whilst Malkovich has a few decent comic moments, but Freeman and Mirren hold themselves much better with more spark in their eyes and wittiness in the projection of the dialogue they speak. They sounded like they were enjoying themselves. Karl Urban does solidly well for his more serious supporting role, but the best person in this was Mary Parker as Sarah. She was terrific as a woman living a normal life but coming to grips that the man she like is a CIA agent and becomes immersed in his world. The action was great and smoothly handled and the music was very good. The style as well was handled nicely as to some extent trying to be cool.Red has been compared to the terrible The Expendables, which is similar in terms of story retired soldiers coming against their own government, but that is where the similarities end. As Red is much better than that trash. Maybe this wasn't as good as it could have been, but it's entertaining enough and is worth seeing. I wouldn't say no to seeing it again, but I would only rent it out on DVD, not see at the pictures or buy it. Saying that it's an enjoyable enough ride and should satisfy anyone's need for harmless entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red Card for RED</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨He got old. Then some thumb-sucker came along and tagged him RED: Retired, Extremely Dangerous.¨ Robert Schwentke (The Time Traveler's Wife, and Flightplan) had the privilege of directing a talented cast including Bruce Willis, Mary-Louise Parker, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Brian Cox, Karl Urban, and Richard Dreyfuss. A lot of big names for the latest adaptation of the DC Comic graphic novel written by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner. One would expect nothing could go wrong with a movie with such great star power, but I was disappointed with this lightly entertaining comedy slash action flick. Red suffers from a poorly adapted screenplay written by Jon and Erich Hoeber (the guys who brought us one of the worst films of 2009: Whiteout). The plot is really bad, and the actors do the best they can in order to save the film. There are some funny moments (but far too few) thanks to the talent from the entire cast that save the movie from falling into horrible territory. John Malkovich gives a very comedic and surprising performance, but unfortunately he doesn't get enough screen time to save the movie. The rest of the cast give good performances, but they are far from memorable. The chemistry between Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker (Weeds) is pretty decent, although nothing we haven't seen before. I really expected this movie would have a lot more funnier moments, but the screenplay failed to help out the great cast. Red could have been much better if the producers would have taken more time in finding better screenwriters. I just felt this movie was like an All-Star team without a good coach to help them win the championship. With a better plot, Red would have been a great and memorable movie.Bruce Willis is Frank Moses, a former CIA agent who is now retired and having a difficult time making the transition. The only thing that seems to keep him going is when he gets to speak over the phone with his government pension representative, Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker). Her life doesn't seem all that exciting either, and she spends her days working and reading sexy spy novels. Sarah and Frank spend a lot of time on the phone discussing their boring and lonely lives without having ever met, but they seem to enjoy each other. Their daily routines will change all of a sudden when someone puts a hit on Frank and tries killing him. Frank might be old, but he's still got game. He manages to elude the dozen of assassins that are sent to his home and decides to give Sarah a visit in Kansas City guessing she might be in danger as well. Frank will need some help in order to discover who is after him so he decides to get his old CIA team back together: Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich), Victoria (Helen Mirren), and Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman). They are all more than happy to get back in action since they all seem to have difficulties adapting to their retiree lives. Together they begin delving into the past in search for clues, while at the same time they have to face the young CIA agent who is after them: William Cooper (Karl Urban). Richard Dreyfuss, Brian Cox, and Julian McMahon also have smaller roles in the film.I really wished this movie would have been funnier considering the talented cast. Malkovich is by far the funniest one in the film; I've seen Willis in better roles; Freeman doesn't add anything to the story; Urban being one of the younger actors proved he has what it takes to stand next to these A-list actors; Louise-Parker was pretty funny in this movie, but she is way better in Weeds; and Helen Mirren always brings her A game to the table. I didn't have a problem with the performances, but I just wished they would have done a better job with the plot and the screenplay. This is one of those movies that looks hilarious in the trailers, but then you discover it isn't actually that funny when sitting through the 100 minute film. Red is not terrible. I actually had a decent time watching it, but it is just light entertainment I wouldn't consider recommending it or watching it over again. The movie did give me a nostalgic feeling seeing how so many of these actors are actually close to their retirement, but they still have the talent if given the right script to work with. I am a huge Bruce Willis fan, but I have to admit John Malkovich stole each scene he was in. Richard Dreyfuss and Brian Cox both have small parts in this movie, but they are really funny in it as well. Seeing these brilliant actors working together is the highlight of the film, but they should have brought in some talented screenwriters as well.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sigh, hard to believe people are giving this anything over a 4/10. Red was a horrible movie all the way through. From the directing style to the just down right bad jokes, this movie was just another piece of garbage that will be forgotten in 6 months. I just don't get who this movie would appeal too? Maybee really REALLY ignorant couples who enjoy laughing with an audience. The only thing missing from the film was a laugh track so everyone could chuckle on command.I don't hate these type of movies, I think everyone liked Men in Black, but this was a really dumb movie. One minute they are driving to New Orleans, than New York, than Florida, all within one day. It almost seemed as if the movie was being written as they were filming it.It seemed as though all of the great actors in the movie just weren't into it. The movie seemed like it was made quickly and everyone got a fat check and thats that. Bruce Willis played the same character he always does from the Whole Nine Yards and the rest of the cast was cliché beyond belief. By the end of the movie you just don't care what happens. The movie tried to be Oceans Eleven but failed horribly. The most annoying thing throughout the ENTIRE movie, I mean every single scene, was the forced soundtrack. Every single scene, and I mean all of them had music playing in the background that was completely unnecessary. Five seconds would go by, and oh there it is, just a bland soundtrack trying to force the movie into an action or just terrible comedic scene.If you like corny, not funny, and downright dumb films, then RED is for you. Just make sure to take out your brain and put it in the seat next to you.Rating = F- Video Game Hollywood .com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Retired Extremely Dangerous ? A Highly Entertaining Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Christmas, the retired middle-aged suburban Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) has a boring routine life. Frank has a crush on the pension department attendant Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker), who is a lonely woman that has disappointing dates, and he tears his checks to talk to her. When a team of heavily armed killers break in Frank's house, he escapes and travels to Sarah's house. When Frank meets Sarah, he explains that he is a former CIA agent tagged RED ? Retired Extremely Dangerous - and her life is in danger since they have had many phone conversations. Sarah does not believe in his words, and Frank abducts her and he crosses the country with Sarah to meet his loyal friends and gets information. He meets and teams up with Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman) that lives in a nursing home; the paranoid Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) that lives hidden in the woods in Florida; the retired Russian spy Ivan Simanov (Brian Cox); and the British assassin Victoria (Helen Mirren). Their investigation shows a huge conspiracy, where the Vice-President Robert Stanton (Julian McMahon) and the gangster and former CIA agent Alexander Dunning (Richard Dreyfuss) are involved. Meanwhile, the efficient CIA agent William Cooper (Karl Urban) is assigned by his boss Cynthia Wilkes (Rebecca Pidgeon) to chase Frank."Red" is a highly entertaining and hilarious action movie. The non-stop action entwined with very funny situations make this film one of the best of the genre that I have recently seen. My family and I laughed a lot with the group of retired extremely dangerous agents, but John Malkovich steals the film with his paranoid character that sees conspiracy everywhere and most of the time is right. Mary-Louise Parker and Helen Mirren are great surprises since this is not their usual genre. If you a seeking a movie simply to entertain and shutdown the brain, "Red" is certainly the right one. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Red ? Aposentados e Perigosos" ("Red ? Retired and Dangerous")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Comedy Action Love Story Willis Special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment Bruce Willis became the perfect action hero in "Die Hard", he has been an audience favorite when overcoming insurmountable odds, while barely getting bruised for his efforts. In this turn, Bruce isn't a cop, but a retired CIA agent, who some unknown force is looking to liquidate. As in past films, swarms of bad supposed good guys come after him. As always, by stealth or by force, Willis outguns or is no match for whomever is sent to get him.First, it is a CIA "hit squad". Then, the always good Karl Urban ( "Chronicles of Riddick", "The Bourne Supremacy" ) is put on the case, and the cat and mouse game unfolds as Willis seeks to learn why he has been targeted for assassination.Unlike the Bourne movies, always deadly serious, this movie actually successfully combines comedy with action, to create an amusing travelogue set like chapters to a book, by the use of postcards with the location of the next scenario. What sets this movie apart is an eclectic mixture of actors you would never expect to see in a Willis action movie. Joining Willis in his quest are no less than Morgan Freeman, John Malkovitch, Helen Mirren, and Brian Cox, other retired agents and Cox as the ex-KGB agent. The former nemesis is now a friend, and those who should be friends, his ex-CIA employers, are now the bad guys.Malkovitch is the scene stealer every time he is on the screen, and his LSD induced mania, described tongue in cheek by Willis, is the result of a past CIA experiment in which Malkovitch was dosed for eleven years. The paranoid ex-agent is usually right when he senses danger, but is still remarkably efficient and proficient, even in his crazed state.Mary Louise Parker is the innocent caught up in the whirlwind of Willis' hunt for clues, and becomes the hunted along with him. She joins the zany bunch of elder agents by circumstance at first, then by choice. Willis, a bored retiree has a long distance crush for the government pension girl, who doesn't realize his former line of work, and who is forced into the fray because as Willis says, "they know I like you".Mayhem, explosions, full scale attacks by huge forces are still no match for the indestructible hero, though there is a sacrifice made, and some blood shed, by some of the Willis cohorts.This isn't rocket science, but a great date movie, a good time, and most important, worth the investment in a ticket. The last time I could say that was "Inception". Look for the cameos of Ernest Borgnine and Richard Dreyfuss. An 8 out of 10, for perfect execution of a Willis reprisal and revival. Go see, and have fun too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RED (Retired: Extremely Dangerous) is directed by Robert Schwentke and loosely based around the three-issue comic book limited series of the same name created by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner. It stars Bruce Willis, Mary-Louise Parker, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Karl Urban, Richard Dreyfuss, Brian Cox &amp; Ernest Borgnine. The screenplay is by Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber.Frank, (Willis), Joe (Freeman), Marvin (Malkovich) and Victoria (Mirren) are ex CIA agents forced out of retirement when it becomes clear someone is out to kill them. Seems they hold the key to a dark secret that could rock America from its political foundations.A fun action packed romp featuring a cast of mature thespians enjoying themselves. What RED lacks in originality of plot it more than makes up for in its willingness to entertain and not to take itself seriously. Apparently lighter in tone than the comics it's based on (not familiar with them myself), it appears to be a good decision by the makers to make it more airy. For this is the sort of cinema fare that most in the family can enjoy: well certainly from the teenagers upwards. The explosions and kills etc are well put together and keep the action fans happy, while the comedy theme of age (these lot certainly aren't too old for this crap), as Bruce and co kick butt, is sure to keep the smile on Mam &amp; Dad's face.A super charismatic cast (some nice cameos too) deliver a movie, which given its familiar plot and aged thematics, is a surprisingly refreshing option at the multiplex. 8/10</fullReview>

A movie like this makes me seriously question the "fairness" of IMDb ratings.Looks like I need to add more content:- Secret service defeated by plot by three year-old.- CIA headquarters entered by similarly inane plan. While inside, no one is seen in corridors, no comes looking at sound of gunfight, etc, etc.- The russians seem to always show up at opportune moment to rescue heroes.- The acting is TERRIBLE.- The plot is completely predictable from scene one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RED! IT MAKES DIE HARD SEEM LIKE Shakespeare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must have missed the point, because I thought this was the daftest film I have seen for some time. I want more for my money than good actors slumming their way through a farcical plot.The ludicrous tone is set right at the start. Our hero Frank Moses (Willis) is living in a very ordinary suburban house in a very ordinary suburban street. The CIA send a hit squad to kill him in the middle of the night but, being Bruce Willis, he disposes of them without turning a hair (he hasn't got any hair, actually). Seeing that things aren't going very well, the spooks send in twenty or so heavily armed men who advance on the house, pouring thousands of rounds of sub-machine gun rounds into it. This utterly destroys the house, which appears to be made of plywood, but of course Brucie is well away by that time.The joke is that all this mayhem occurs without ANY of the neighbours so much as looking out of the window, let alone running around in panic. Just another night in the burbs, presumably.Later on there is a scene in which Frank Moses empties an automatic pistol into a car, causing its driver no little concern. This happens in a busy street, but again nobody takes any notice.The CIA man out to get Frank is an odd character, too. He is a cold-blooded killer (the first time we see him he gets what he wants from a captive with a rope around his neck, then he kicks the stool away and watches him die: charming feller). However,he goes home at night to his lovely wife and adorable children. Had a good day at the office, dear? I seem to recall that Arnold Schwarzeneggar, in True Lies, was also a family man. That was a daft film as well.The other characters are pretty much unbelievable. Morgan Freeman is OK but under-used, and John Malkovich and Helen Mirren are over-used. Malkovich seems to be trying to play Donald Sutherland's character Oddball from Kelly's Heroes, but comes over as unhinged rather than wry and canny. Mirren is part-Mother Superior and part-Xena, Warrior Princess, and she has the enviable ability to take a bullet through the guts and show no ill-effects afterwards.All in all a disappointing outing. I could have stayed at home and cut my toenails.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>in this action film with bits of comedy thrown in. It's a revamp of Die Hard with a lot of famous castmates. Willis plays Frank, retired CIA, whom finds himself on a hit list. He goes to save this girl, Sarah, whom he's befriended, then it's off to track down other retirees. He gets Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirran to solve the mystery. It has something to do with a mission in Guatamale from 1981. And they learn CIA is trying to kill them and it goes all the way to the top: the Vice President.This is a suspend reality type of movie. It's got some funny moments and was entertaining.FINAL VERDICT: If you are looking for a popcorn flick, then this is a good choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rad Shade of "Red"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Retired and Extremely Dangerous (R.E.D.), that is the acronym for Red, the story of retired CIA agents being hunted down by the agency because of the secrets that they know. As is usual with these espionage flicks, there are twists, there are turns, but this movie takes the usual tropes of a Jack Ryan-Tom Clancy movie and makes it all funny.In this cartoonish action flick, Bruce Willis plays retired CIA agent, Frank Moses, who has fallen in love with the woman over the telephone line in charge of his government pension, Sarah (played by Mary-Louise Parker). But when CIA agents come knocking on Frank's door, Frank has no choice but to run and kidnap his love, who he has never seen. With Sarah at his side, Frank reassembles his old unit, consisting of vet actors like Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren.The jokes fly between these veteran actors with so much ease, you would think that these consummate professionals have been working together all their lives, and that is the mark of a truly magnificent actor. John Malkovich gives probably the most memorable turn as a retiree who is constantly paranoid that the government is watching him, but Helen Mirren isn't far behind with her trigger happy, Grandmommy James Bond seductress, persona. I thought actor Karl Urban, playing the agent hunting R.E.D. down, was a nice foil to Bruce Willis's character, but Morgan Freeman actually had the most forgettable role in the whole movie, dying halfway through. While the movie has some missed opportunities in terms of exploring the proposed concepts of not having a life or love when part of the CIA, these few moments of proposal are never really explored which could have made this movie a more memorable romp.Director Robert Schwentke directs the action sequences with a visual flare that many directors seem to lack when working in this genre, but the story is often vague. Why R.E.D. is being hunted by the CIA is never explained in full; we know all of this stuff they're fighting for means something to these characters, but we, as the audience, are clueless as to why. While the overall ride gives you just enough information to warrant you wanting to sit through to the next action sequence, this movie could have been so much more had this story been made clearer. Regardless, the movie is an enjoyable action flick with some slick visuals and a fair few laughs to warrant the time.I give Red a 7 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland Comic Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The message of the new Bruce Willis action-comedy "Red" is that old coots kick ass. Ostensibly based on the limited-run, three-issue, DC Comics graphic novel, this sophomoric spy versus spy saga pits a quartet of retired but elite black op spies against every gun that the CIA can assemble. The cliché in all spy movies is loyal spies always wind up dodging bullets from their own folks rather than their foes. Ironically, an old Soviet spy pitches in to help our heroes. Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, and John Malkovich play the coots who wield arms against the CIA. Not only do they kick the CIA in the pants, but they also convince some of the smarter CIA folks to knock-off the idiots that wanted our old heroes dead. "Time Traveler's Wife" director Robert Schwentke does a better job of staging some dramatic action scenes with fusillades of gunfire and fireball explosions galore than "Whiteout" screenwriters Erich and Jon Hoeber did with adapting the Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner graphic novel. "Red," an acronym for 'retired, extremely dangerous,' qualifies as a lame-brained, half-baked shoot'em up with too much set-up and not enough pay-off. Meaning, Schwentke and his scenarists conjure up some half-hearted hokum about Willis and company going after the Vice President. The action scenes are straightforward while the dialogue scenes are sometimes too cute for their own good. Die-hard "Red" graphic novel aficionados may not appreciate this light-hearted approach. The graphic novel emphasized grim action without humor. Ellis has written about the film, "So, yes, RED the film is very different. Not least because it needed to generate more material than the book itself actually constituted." Schwentke and company have added new characters and fleshed out the plot. No, head CIA honcho Michael Beesley is not the chief villain. Moreover, Beesley's character never appears. Bruce Willis surrounds himself with several other spies to do what he would have done single-handed in the past. Mind you, "Red" surpasses both earlier Willis outings "Cop Out" and "Surrogates." No, it doesn't top "Live Free or Die Hard." Retired CIA agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis of "Die Hard") loves to flirt on the phone with customer service agent Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker of "Weeds"), a Kansas City gal who wants to see the world. Basically, Frank tells her he isn't receiving his pension checks and uses this as pretext to chat. One night the CIA shows up with guns blazing, and our indestructible hero takes them out with extreme prejudice. Leaving Cleveland, Frank rushes to Kansas City to protect an initially reluctant Sarah who doesn't want to accompany him. Frank knows the CIA has tapped his phone and that the CIA would probably kill Sarah. While all this is transpiring, CIA Agent William Cooper (Karl Urban of "Star Trek") is ordered by his superior Cynthia Wilkes (Rebecca Pidgeon of "Heist") to terminate Frank Moses. Meantime, Frank and Sarah scoot to New Orleans to pick up Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman of "Unforgiven") and they learn from Joe that the hit team that tried to eliminate Frank murdered an investigative journalist writing an expose piece. Our hero and heroine find a list of names, including Frank's name, and ponder its mysterious significance. Next, Frank and Sarah recruit paranoid conspiracy theorist Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich of "Con-Air"), who believes Frank is out to kill him. Marvin is so paranoid he has built a large, above-ground house to serve as a distraction for anybody who comes gunning for him.Meanwhile, he invites Frank and Sarah to join him in his underground house. Marvin raises the hood on an old rusty automobile, and they clamber inside, only to descend on stairs to his subterranean residence. Marvin examines the list and points out that everybody on the list participated in a covert operation in Guatemala. They contact one of the guys on the list, Gabriel Singer (James Remar of "The Warriors"), and no sooner do they meet Gabriel than the CIA assassinates him. Frank isn't satisfied with what little that he knows, so he approaches Soviet espionage agent Ivan Simanov (Brian Cox of "The Glimmer Man") to furnish him with all the codes and faked identity cards so Sarah and he can break into the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. Tom Cruise did this in "Mission: Impossible," but "Red" doesn't drum up any white-knuckled suspense. Frank masquerades as an army general to obtain the actual records of the Guatemalan incident. Naturally, as in "Mission: Impossible," our heroes set a fire to cover their escape and take advantage of a firefighter to slip past the villains. Frank tangles with Cooper during his foray at the agency and catches a bullet in the shoulder. Marvin takes our wounded hero to see Victoria (Helen Mirren of "The Queen") and she fixes him up in a jiffy and then signs on with them. Eventually, our heroes learn that Vice President Robert Stanton (Julian McMahon of "Nip/Tuck") wiped out an entire village in Guatemala when he was soldier. Frank and his men were dispatched to clean up debacle and now Stanton apparently wants them dead so they can tell no tales.Everybody looks like they had a blast making this silly shenanigan of a spy movie. Bruce Willis doesn't do anything that we haven't seen him do better in better movies. Willis' co-stars outshine him. Watching delicate Helen Mirren on a noisy machine gun strafing either a limo or a group of gunmen is hoot. John Malkovich has the best role as a crazy agent who totes around a stuffed pink pig. Morgan Freeman gets the short shrift, while Richard Dreyfuss plays the nefarious villain behind Stanton. Screen legend Ernst Borgnine of "The Dirty Dozen" puts in a brief appearance as the man-in-charge of the CIA's records. Altogether, "Red" emerges as the kind of movie that you should wait to rent on DVD or Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

The film had me enthralled; several times during the film I actually jumped in my seat due to a sudden surprise. Other times I laughed out loud and clapped. The cast had a lot of chemistry; John Malkovich stole the show as a crazy, paranoid retired CIA operative. Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren were completely believable as RED (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) former CIA. Another thing to appreciate about this film: No plot holes.

Everyone is sooo flippant about the situation it actually comes off as brutally funny. My sons and I actually watched it four nights in a row, because we kept discovering details previously missed. Like "the Party" a lot is going on in the background that can only be noticed in multiple viewings. Pure silliness of a story, but the script and the delivery of the lines are simply outstanding.

		<fullReview>Like Michael Corleone, Bruce Willis is out and they drag him back in, but this isn't business. Someone has got a black ops operation on some retired black ops operators. Enough to make anyone see Red.It's quite a reunion Willis has as he starts looking around and sees that a lot of former colleagues are meeting sudden demises. He gets to a few of them like Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, and John Malkovich and he even gets a Russian consultant in former KGB agent Brian Cox. When they're not reminiscing about old times, Cox does help point them in the right direction. Red must have taken some inspiration from the two Over The Hill gang movies from the Sixties. Without the western setting and those colorful western character actors, Red gets quite a few laughs in mostly from John Malkovich. He's easily the best performance in Red, playing a paranoid survivalist who has learned to be paranoid, it does keep the group alive or most of them in this film.Willis has perfected a nice dead pan comic style in his performance. Although I really can't see what Mary Louise Parker, the young woman working at Social Security who gets involved with Willis and then enmeshed in their counter ops operation.What's this all about, let's just say that it's coming from the highest or nearly the highest level possible. Someone doesn't want a lot of people around to tell tales. And at the end of the film I'd love to know how the government covers up what happens in the climax.93 year old Ernest Borgnine is trying to surpass John Gielgud's record of still acting when he was 97 has a small, but important role as the record keeper in the underground vault of the Central Intelligence Agency. Talk about knowing where all the bodies are buried. Ernie looks remarkable for his age and this is not his last project.Try to catch Red, it's stylish paranoia to be sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like it when an entertaining movie also manages to kick up a little controversy. I'm speaking here of the whole business about Joe (Morgan Freeman) giving it up for the team so Frank (Bruce Willis) and Marvin (John Malkovich) can make their escape. I too have watched that scene a number of times and there's enough ambiguity in it to come up with any number of conclusions. Because Joe and Frank said their good-byes to each other, I'm inclined to believe that Joe is dead, but remember, this is a comic book story. Heck, even Superman died and came back. I think Joe could too with the right kind of writing, I can probably come up with a scenario myself. We'll just have to wait and see.Anyway, as many times as Bruce Willis does Bruce Willis, he's still cool to watch. I enjoy deadpan humor sprinkled with sarcasm and occasional insight into the human condition. Teaming him up with Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren was something like, well if not genius, at least semi-smart. They all worked well and played off each other like only competent assassins could. The part of Sarah could probably have been done by any versatile actress, but Parker really did get into the groove once the picture got going.The Ernie Borgnine double cameo was a bonus too. Going strong at ninety five as I write this makes me want to see him hit the century mark in some film. Has that ever been done before? Maybe if 'Red 2' makes it, he can follow it up in 'Red 3'. No one could ever accuse him of being Retired: Extremely Dangerous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action-Packed Good-Natured Senior Citizen Spy Story With Sensational Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Moses is a retired CIA operative whom someone is trying to kill. The hit-squad seems to pertain to a mission in Guatemala many years before, so Frank tracks down some of his old colleagues and resolves to figure out who's behind it all.This is a very agreeable, exciting, silly, comic-book action thriller whose primary asset is its great cast of top-rank thespians, all enjoying themselves tremendously in much more low-brow parts than usual. The mix of high-octane action and comedy is reminiscent of some other movies (Real Men, True Lies), but making all the principals thirty years older than normal is an inspired touch. Cox is wonderful as Ivan the KGB man nostalgically bemoaning the advent of glasnost, Malkovich steals it (as usual) as a jittery paranoiac, Mirren looks great in a white cocktail dress shooting an Uzi, Dreyfuss is terrific as a smug grinning villain and Borgnine has a lovely little bit as the CIA Record Keeper. Poor Urban (Eomer from The Lord Of The Rings movies) gets lumbered with the only straight part but ploughs on with great gusto and is every bit as good as his senior colleagues. The action scenes are handled with great aplomb, there are some stylish touches (I especially like the postcard graphic dissolves) and the conspiracy story bumbles along very amiably with plenty of twists en route. It may have a few flaws - the rhythm stumbles from time to time and the more sentimental moments could perhaps be dropped - but this is good quality get-happy entertainment with a terrific ensemble cast. An independent production by Summit Entertainment and DC Comics, shot in Canada and based on a comic book mini-series by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner. The title comes from Moses' file status; Retired - Extremely Dangerous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Red alert! Red alert! Red alert! Red alert! Redrum! Redrum! Redrum! OK, how did that transform itself into a critical warning to a creepy "murder spelled backwards" fixation? I just wanted to provide this review an initial "Shining" moment. OK, enough. I am here to review the action-comedy "Red". So "rede" or not, here I come. At first, I was a little puzzled upon seeing that "Red" was nominated for a Best Motion Picture (Comedy/Musical) Golden Globe nomination last year. But I must admit now that "Red" was a viable nominee. I had much fun watching this movie about retired black-ops agents who reassemble their team when retired ops leader Frank Moses is targeted by a group of assailants who might very well have government connections. "Red" stands for retired and extremely dangerous, which fits the bill these days of Regis Philbin, George Bush (both of them), and Joan Rivers (is she retired?). Director Robert Schwentke excels in keeping the "Red" action unpredictable with a nice touch of sarcastic comedy, due much to the on- target screenplay of Jon &amp; Erich Hoeber. The geriatric and non-geriatric cast of "Red" was stellar, even though that is "old news" since this movie was released last year. Bruce Willis was vintage Bruce with his wily performance as Frank Moses. Malkovich! Malkovich! Malkovich! Sorry, I got a bit excited that the actor human being John Malkovich was in this movie, and delivered yet another scene-stealing performance as retired ops Marvin Boggs. Morgan Freeman as retired ops Joe Matheson did not have to do much acting, but his presence is always welcome in any movie even when his narration is not required. Damn was Dame Helen Mirren good as the badass retired ops Victoria, and they give her a machine gun in this one! Yea Baby! Other great supporting turns came in the way of Brian Cox playing Russian inside man Ivan Simanov, Karl Urban as CIA Agent William Cooper, and the lovely Mary-Louise Parker as Moses' romantic interest Sarah Ross. So head on over to the "red light district" and get the red out and get your DVD or Blu-Ray Player ready for "Red". **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is a man living a seemingly mundane life, until he finds a group of hired assassins trying to kill him. He then reveals himself as a retired killer, who's on a hit list with a group of other operatives, including Victoria (Helen Mirren), Mathison (Morgan Freeman) and Boggs (John Malkovich) after a mission in South America went wrong. Taking his new girlfriend hostage to keep her safe, the group get their first lead in a murdered journalist and find corruption leading up to the vice president.This high profile action flick has received generally more favourable reviews from the critics. It opens well, setting the tone nicely for more of the same stuff through-out, which is just as well, because action is a genre that desperately needs something to come along and shake it up a bit. But somehow Red doesn't live up to this early promise, and emerges as another example of how the genre can't compare with the sort of classics it used to be known for (for this critic, anyway.) The story just feels really disjointed and hard to get into, not clever enough to be confusing, just...a bit of a mess, really. In the midst of this, it's hard to spot any really exciting action, which only serves to make the pace drag even more.Cast wise, all of them are just working on the personas they're known for, and not to great effect. Willis should manage this sort of thing in his sleep, but here can't make his wise cracking hard man act stand out much, ditto Morgan Freeman, who's just softly spoken again, and wise cracking here and there, while Malkovich does his wacky eccentric thing to the most annoying effect he can. Only Mirren offers anything resembling class and gravitas, with her presence in the film. Generally a mess, this finds itself in the 'red' from very early on, and doesn't stray away from this. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rip roarin' good time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A team of Ex- Intelligence operatives come out of retirement when they're lazy days are disturbed by pesky assassins. Led by Frank (Bruce Willis) the team marked RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous) reorganizes to embark on one last mission.It's interesting that all of the stars have at one point played an assassin in their acting career; Helen Mirren ? Shadow Boxer, Bruce Willis ? The Jackal, Morgan Freeman ? Wanted and The Contract, John Malkovich ? In the Line of Fire. Upon seeing the trailer I got a chuckle because those where the characters that came to mind. Granted those bad guys didn't ride off into to the sunset to live a happy retirement. But this is a cool premise to show that even though a person may not be 25 years old they can still be formidable adversaries.All are now retired trying to live peaceful, relatively normal lives. But sometimes the past just doesn't go away. Frank must find out who is killing former operatives and why. With the help of Joe (Morgan Freeman) they follow the trail that leads them to smarmy arms dealer Alexander Dunning (Richard Dreyfuss). Wow, when was the last time Richard Dreyfuss was in a movie? With Hollywood being so youth driven, it's nice to see some older folks taking center stage. It's not every day that you see the over 50 crowd shooting guns and blowing up stuff. This movie was so fun. The quirky characters are a scream. Seeing Helen Mirren, the queen for goodness sake, shooting a gun so gigantic that it may as well have been a cannon was worth the ticket price alone.John Malkovich's paranoia keeps the audience chuckling with his crazy eyes and mannerisms. His scene at the ship yards highlights that he is still a bad ass. Mary Louise-Parker does a wonderful job as the wide-eyed ditzy love interest of Frank, Sara. Frank has been pretending not to receive his pension checks in order to talk with Sara, the customer service representative, on the phone. With his phone is probably bugged the bad guys know he likes her. So Frank "kidnaps" Sara for her own safety. Somehow these two seem a perfect fit; the customer service agent and retired spy/assassin. Yep, sounds right to me, haha.In true action movie fashion we see that Bruce, the youngest of the team, has still got it in a scene when he goes one on one with Karl Urban. There's nothing like a little hand to hand combat. There is plenty of shattered glass, punches you can feel in the audience and broken bones.The storyline was a little weak but it was enough to keep things moving. The idea is that the Vice President has ordered exterminations due to their involvement in an operation many years ago. Yeah whatever, the ultimate draw is watching these guys kill. In a nutshell, go see Red, enjoyable characters and premise. It's worth the dough.www.rivareviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>REVIEW:I enjoyed this film, it is great as there is romance for the girls, action for the boys, and comedy for the adults. I must admit; I did laugh quite allot while watching the film! But it is quite slow at some parts!THE CAST:The cast is one of the good things this film needed, Some of my all time favorite, Like cast: Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman. You can see a full list of the cast and crew here: www.imdb.com/title/tt1245526/fullcredits#castTHE STORY:Frank (willis) is a retired Black-Ops CIA agent who's living a quiet, retired life; He often calls a woman (Mary-Louise Parker), who at a Pention Support, When a Hit team come and try to kill both Frank and Sarah, they go on the run, and Frank reassembles RED (Retired &amp; Extremely dangerous).RATING:I have given this film 8/10 because although it is fun and Action- Packed, there is a few scenes in the film were it goes a bit slow and boring :(AGE:bbfc: 12IMDb: PG-13I think this film would have been even more successful if they had put more features in it to make it a 15. The fact it was a 12 nearly put me off me watching it, so I'm sure it will have done the same thing for others!Thanks for reading the review, -Sam Kelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was compelled to write something about this movie after reading some of the reviews I found here. More specifically the negative reviews. I respect the opinions of other people. Everyone certainly has the right to like or dislike whatever movie they choose. That being said. I HATE all these people on here who who trash a movie like this, and look down on the people who were actually entertained by it. Sure you didn't like the movie. But why do you have to be a snob about it. IMO if you are one of the people who didn't like this movie and say, "if you can take your brain out to watch this." You seriously need to chill out and stop taking yourself so seriously. For that matter why are you watching a movie in this genre. Go watch something serious and leave the people who actually know how to relax for a second and enjoy a movie like this alone. This was an entertaining movie. I'd watch it again. That is all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You just never know what is going to happen when they pull together such a diverse cast - but this movie fires on all cylinders. Bruce Willis is perfect as the retired CIA agent feeling adrift with nothing but a 'normal' life to live. Helen Mirren is gorgeous and unexpected as the retired British flower arranging bad ass. John Malkovich I have never been a fan of, but he killed every scene he's in as the crazed 'conspiracy theory' member of the team. Brian Cox played his role with enthusiasm. Morgan Freeman is...well..Morgan Freeman! Last but not least is Mary Louise Parker (also not a big fan of hers) who was perfect as the mousy customer service rep dreaming of a life of adventure outside her office cube farm. Throw in super sexy Karl Urban as the young blood agent trying to figure out what side of the action he should be fighting on and Richard Dreyfuss as the snarky bad guy and it's pure heaven. Even Ernie Borgnine gets a few laughs in his small part. I saw this in the theatres, I have it on Blu-Ray and I watch it over and over on cable. I can't think of an action movie I've enjoyed this much in years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a disappointment! I still try to wrap my head around the fact that a director (Robert Schwentke) who has great actors like Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren and a sufficient budget at his disposal is able to produce such an utterly crap..Pardon my french!! So what went wrong? I dare to say almost everything: Stiff and lifeless acting, lame jokes and a horrible soundtrack. If you watched the trailer then you have already seen the best parts! I highly doubt that anyone with a brain is able to enjoy the story let alone the whole movie. Directing a movie isn't an easy thing to do and that is one of the reasons why there are only a few people on this planet who are able to master this craft. Clearly Robert Schwentke isn't one of them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hostility Towards and Mistrust of Halfway-Decent Storytelling Sense, Smart Moviegoers and the Slightest Investment of Any Aesthetic Value</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RED features noteworthy stars doing things we wish were worthy of any note. Indeed the star turns are this eye roll-inducing cash-in's wrongfully perceived validation, with the mugging performances filling the void of any remotely believable dramatic tension. Despite all four Oscar winners, cumbersome, gleaming, brainless RED has almost nothing going for it apart from its own squandering, mockingly contemptuous wastefulness.Bruce Willis stars in this anti-brain waste of talent, which refers to his alert level, "retired: extremely dangerous." Clever, I guess. He's ex-CIA, black ops, who finds out bad guys want to kill him. So he musters the members of his old killing squad, and they shoot and blow things up. Actually, not so much that as firing lots of bullets in the general directions of other people, and blowing them up. The lineup features Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren and Brian Cox. And the black affiliate must die first, "because that's how he would have wanted it." So once more poor Morgan Freeman is squandered.Besides his old buddies, Bruce takes along Mary-Louise Parker, a telephone operator at the agency that manages his pension. He's fallen in love with her voice. He says she has to go on the run with him because her life is in danger. Of course. Her life will be much safer with the target of thousands of rounds of automatic weapon fire. The villains in thrillers couldn't play Duck Shot on Atari. And the good guys are only any better because the screenwriter is the god exercising deus ex machina for your viewing pleasure, not because they've endowed their characters with any brains or inner life to speak of.This celluloid vacuum isn't even close to as skillful as it acts like it is. It runs out of steam not even 15 minutes in and begins repeating itself, and the deficiency of a persuasive plot thread doesn't alleviate this syndrome. The film's over-the-topness does not excuse unanswered questions like why not a single neighbor not only looks outside or calls the police but even turns on their lights after Willis' house is completely destroyed by an entire tactical team armed with machine guns they unload various times? Why do the bad guys want our grizzled group dead? I sincerely cannot recall. Why does Mamet's beautiful and underused wife Rebecca Pidgeon, playing the zealous handler of our team's main CIA adversary, send this top agent of hers into a top-secret archive to get a highly classified report which she knows exposes absolutely nothing? If a notoriously effective CIA assassin is so inordinately good at what he does, why does he sit his kidnap victim in the back of his car with duct tape over her mouth while driving busy roads long distance? Why does Willis infiltrate a character's home to hold a family hostage and then leave without achieving anything? Why am I still sitting here even halfway through, still watching this? If a spoilsport evaluator has the nerve to spotlight that Willis is risking a stranger's life for no worthy reason and that ditzy Parker never raises a sincere protest about it, defenders will respond that an action comedy doesn't have to make sense if it's got enough, you know, action and comedy. But the action is a flaccid miscellany of slo-mo and CGI, and save for Malkovich, who's intermittently useful as a madcap LSD martyr, the comedy comprises cheesy, ineffectual backbiting rather than incisive remarks about age or espionage.I think middle-aged and older folks are supposed to enjoy this abject nonsense, because it's ceaselessly trying to manipulate us with music and contrived revelation how clever it thinks its retired characters are, and that they've "still got it," but the joke is on this movie because it's just as inexhaustibly stupid and utterly routine as any number of Michael Bay, John Cena or Vin Diesel vehicles those little shavers guzzle down. The only difference is that this one can't decide whether it's a farce or a retread.In one scene, Mirren is shot and a blood stain spreads on her white dress. In a closing scene not a day later, she's perfectly chipper and has had time to send the dress out to the cleaners. A story is about diligence, attention to detail, not shortcuts and the path of least resistance to all the big bangs. But what is so maddening about this movie is not its storytelling flaws and anti-intellectual cheesiness, but that the overseers at Summit and DC Entertainment know it. And every coveted master performer in its amazing cast knows it too. It's all a big flex of Hollywood's muscle, reminding us that no matter how increasingly hard it is to get a truthful human story made out there, how many personal visions are squandered and artistic visions are rejected, the bigwigs can in a time of recession take $60 million, effortlessly gather the most eye-popping jamboree of great actors we've ever seen and crap all over our faces. And make their money back. So they can do it again. And again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RED (retired extremely dangerous) (2010) is a very entertaining and thrilling action film. Helen Mirren was by far my favorite character in this movie! She was great in this movie, so slick and cool!! And of course Bruce Willis is great in here, such a great action hero, as he is in most movies. Mary Louise Parker and Morgan Freeman were great as well, all the characters in RED are so well constructed and cool to see. The script for this movie is well written and has just the right amount of action and comedy mixed in. The director really did a great job with the action sequences, they were very slick and fun to watch. The visuals and the whole look of the movie is very good too, and I loved the costume design as well. Overall, the bottom line is that RED is just a cool, fun time for all to see! There is also very funny dialogue between the characters, Marty Louise Parker's character is especially funny. I really loved her character! 10/10 for RED! Love it every time, never gets old.</fullReview>

Direction, music, storyline are very good, this is indeed a fun watch. Love it. I fail to understand this minimum 10 sentence wording that IMDb insists on, what is the point of that? Be it is, this is a fun movie to watch and not to be taken seriously. I'm getting the 10th line in so there.

And boy, was I not impressed?Bruce Willis is amazing as the action hero who kicks ass with his oldie friend group to get back what he has only achieved recently. What sets off as a mystery, then turns out to be an action beauty with trips &amp; turns, explosions, gun-slinging, snipers &amp; RPGs, CIA &amp; SS, oh God!Music is the attraction of this movie with an extra applause to the screenplay. The initial sequence involving Bruce's real identity is magnificent. And the background music is cool! Locations are exotic and the postcard depiction is inventive. Someone rightly said that this should have been the real Expendables. Still, with a small plot hole in this fantastic vividness of action genre, I would recommend it because we have Morgan freeman and the lady here is hot. John Malkovich is crazily genuine as editing is sufficient. 7/10BOTTOM LINE: Get that DVD/Bluray NOW! But, if you hate action movies with comedy punches, clichéd CIA operations &amp; love affairs, you may not like this.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

		<shortDescription>Very Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red was a great action-comedy film, which I would recommend for anyone who likes the genre. To start it has a star-studded cast, Bruce Willis (Die Hard, Pulp Fiction), Morgan Freeman (The Shawshank Redemption, Se7en), John Malkovich (Dangerous Liaisons, Burn After Reading), Helen Mirren (The Queen, Excalibur) and Karl Urban (Star Trek, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers). All of these actors played their characters perfectly. The film got into the action almost from the very start, and I was thinking that it would be more of an action film, than an action- comedy, but I waited about 20-30 minutes, and i discovered how wrong I was. The movie continued to be perfect in every way, besides the plot did't make total sense to me. Red was a film that I had originally not thought so greatly off. I saw the trailer and thought, "that could be pretty good, but I'll wait until it comes out on DVD". Now I regret thinking that. Red had me on the edge of my seat the entire way through, while also making me crack up laughing. If you thought about this film but then decided no, I would definitely Re-consider watching this film. Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Die Hard With A Pension"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you know that RED stands for 'Retired: Extremely Dangerous', you expect older actors and explosive action and you get plenty of both from a film with its tongue so firmly in its cheek that it's almost a spoof. Leading the gang of ex special ops personnel is Bruce Willis which might suggest an alternative title of "Die Hard With A Pension".Other members of the old - in both senses of the word - team are gravelly Morgan Freeman, manic Johm Malkovich and cool Helen Mirren (great to see the one-time Queen with huge weaponry). Want some more old-timers? You've got Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfus and even Ernest Borgnine (now in his 90s). The only young actors - and they are in their 40s - are Mary-Louise Parker and less well known Karl Urban.So this is not a movie for the usual teenage demographic of much Hollywood fare but more a pitch to attract the middle-aged viewer who will enjoy familiar faces combined with action and humour but wonder where the plot went.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good, Wild Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sometimes exciting escapist film about retired CIA agents who are being targeted for a mission they were involved in in 1981 in Guatemala, this film stars Bruce Willis as Frank Moses, seemingly a quiet guy living in suburban Cleveland. He strikes up a phone friendship with Sarah (Mary Louise Parker) and he finds out he is a target. Eventually they go to New Orleans where they see Joe (Morgan Freeman, somewhat underused but still solid) and the slightly deranged Marvin (the always great John Malkovich). Essentially, they are hunting down the people who are trying to kill them. No need to go into any further detail except to mention Helen Mirren's also small but pivotal role, this film is a lot of fun. It has violence of course, but it held my interest throughout. I'm giving it a nine because of its entertainment value. It should have been a bigger hit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I kept on Laughing.... and Ducking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first few minutes of this movie are blissfully misleading. You could at this point be forgiven for thinking this movie was about to be another Sleepless in Seattle. But then three guys in homeland security fancy dress costumes pump lead into the fixtures and fittings of Bruce Willis' house. Next thing you see is Willis tossing a handful of ammo into a frying pan and leaving it on a roaring stove. After that it all gets hot and messy as a load more guys give the house a lead makeover. There after, the action never stops. The plot moves quickly and turns right angles throughout. And it's funny. It's a non stop giggle even though the violence is pleasantly graphic. Nice cameo performances from Ernest Borgnine and Richard Dreyfuss - always good value. Karl Urban plays cold steel - he was riveting in The Bourne Supremacy as Kiril the Russian Treadstone assassin - and does action well. He's focused and smart and dangerous. He's a guy to watch. Willis is as ever Willis, clinical, whimsical etc. always watchable. Great action and physically punishing. Marie Louise-Parker, civilian and Willis' love interest seemed to get used to being shot at too easily. I know I could never get used to it as a civilian. That aside she got my sympathy. Helen Mirren and Brian Cox, stalwart quality performances. John Malkovich though was matchless. His character, ex CIA and somewhat unhinged by years of acid abuse and paranoia just kept me laughing. An actor who often plays malevolence - and nobody does that better - playing an almost homicidal nut job who's so paranoid he believes everybody is out to get him.... and they are! And yet he is a ruthless killer too. I don't know, he just made me laugh the whole way through. A great performance like the Muppets character "Animal" in human form. Good film, lots of laughs, action and destruction. Not a cerebral experience but then that isn't what I watched it for. I watched it for fun - and it was!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cast truly is great in RED</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cast truly is great in RED, and I don't simply mean the actors in general; they simply all give full-on great, funny performances. The subtle (but hilarious) underlying lament of these characters is they all reminisce over their past lives as hardened assassins and pine just to kill one more little ol' person. More at the forefront of course is the bang-on wry humour and delicious action sequences. This is old fashion stunt work at play here (fittingly perhaps) and I'll take it over a green screen any day. These bursts of adrenaline are dumb to be sure, but not totally ludicrous; think of a cross between Die Hard and Enemy of the State. What they are not is anything short of exciting and kinetic, and are interspersed with laughs in such a way as to not drift to one focus too long. RED also gleefully embraces its comic book origins, using playful transitions as the globe-trotting commences. Yet again, director Robert Schwentke never revels in one gimmick for too long and the film goes down smooth and easy as a result.The younger cast is more than worth mentioning as well, with the highest accolades going to Mary-Louis Parker from TV's Weeds. There is a joke in RED which I am not sure was intentioned, when after being injected with a knockout-drug, Parker's Sarah exclaims "I'm so high". She steals most scenes when given the chance but her character (a love interest of Frank who unintentionally gets caught up in the fracas) is utilized far more towards the beginning of the film. Karl Urban is also solid as a CIA operative tasked in finding the RED's but becomes suspicious at his orders which grow increasingly corrupt. I always wonder in the movie world how they would explain attack helicopters shredding an airport to the general public. The government must have some amazing PR agents on staff. Richard Dreyfus (in his second cameo of the year after Piranha) is also well used as an oily arms dealer who comes across the team's path.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie full of action, but above all, a movie featuring a cast of true stars, who we probably would like to see in better or other kinds of movie, but who prove that when actors are talented they can make even the silliest movie entertaining. In this case the actors are perfectly capable of interpreting the ironic mood of the picture, and the result is a movie with true laughable, funny moments. John Malkohvic is simply great, never seen Ellen Mirren with a high-tech gun in her hands, but always refined even in that role, Bruce Willis in his traditional role of a tough guy with a tender heart never disappoints, and Morgan Freeman, well, is always the great Morgan Freeman. Ageing actors (note also a 93-year-old Ernest Borgnine) who are not ashamed of getting old and on the contrary play ironically and intelligently with ageing roles, to prove also that nowadays there are not many younger performers reaching their high level of acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie that is unique straight from the top menu. It features visual styling similar to a Marvel film, with fun animation and wonderful editing in the top menu as well as in the credits. The special effects throughout the movie are on par with summer blockbusters.Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, Hellen Mirren, and John Malkovich are just a few of the actors that make up the experienced, recognizable cast of characters, all of which play a distinct and useful role in the movie. The younger actors Mary-Louise Parker and Karl Urban provide a fun contrast to the older, more "outdated" characters played by the rest. Even though the basic plot is nothing fantastic ? a former CIA agent avoiding capture and discovering a deadly secret ? the wide variety of unusual characters and a few interesting plot twists keep you entertained and wanting to see what happens next.Of course, Bruce Willis does phenomenally well playing the "Retired Extremely Dangerous" CIA agent Frank Morris. He's just as clever as he is dangerous throughout, while John Malkovich adds humor to nearly every scene he plays as the paranoid ex-agent without being overly comical. On its surface, RED bristles with intense "Die Hard" style action interlaced with witty humor that everyone can appreciate.The characters played by Morgan Freeman, Mary-Louise Parker, and Karl Urban give the movie a deeper meaning and sense of drama and romance. Mary-Louise Parker's character finds herself in a real life romantic thriller novel, while Morgan Freeman's character gives the audience a heartfelt story of life and death that leaves you feeling good inside. The young, arrogant presence of Karl Urban's character sets up unmistakable drama between him and the experienced Frank Morris keeping the audience on the edge of their seat.There are moments in the film that seem overly ridiculous and fairly unlikely to happen, but those are all part of the fun of the movie and are easily overlooked.As a whole, the movie gets an 8/10. The acting is wonderful, the visuals are pleasing and cool to look at, the plot is mostly sound, and any flaws are insignificant enough to be ignored. Simply put, its exciting, hilarious, and fun for anyone to watch. Whether you like action, comedy, or drama, this movie has something everyone will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say this film does exactly what it says on the tin; it's brash, explosive and it also has some humour splattered about in there. I did like Bruce Willis in this one; some of his wise cracks put me in mind of his character David Addison in "Moonlighting" (an old TV show for those too young to remember it). I loved John Malkovich as the, almost paranoid, member of the team; he added some great comic moments. Helen Mirren was great (as ever), as was Richard Dreyfuss as the bad guy and Brian Cox. Also a mention fro Karl Urban who played his role with great aplomb; he'll go far I'm sure. As to the film; well I enjoyed many aspects of it although I did find the age difference between Willis and Parker a tad creepy. Other than that, bring on the sequel! I found it a lot of fun and everything 'The Expendables' isn't; well worth the price of the disc.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 6.9/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RED is a movie that is goofy, unrealistic, and funny. It has acting that is both intentionally cheesy and fun, and also great. The action scenes are awesome, and Bruce Willis and Helen Mirren really stand out as having the best characters and the best scenes. Bruce Willis is, obviously, a big action star, and this movie plays on the fact that he is. It acknowledges that age catches up to people, but that does not mean it needs to make them frail and weak. When Helen Mirren first came in, it felt like a joke. A thin old woman, albeit very pretty and a fantastic actor, wielding weapons that men and women in their twenties and thirties have trouble handling. But she quickly proved to be no joke. She kicked butt, and that is not a term I use often. Overall, the film is incredibly enjoyable, and if you do not laugh or smile, or at the very least enjoy it, I will have a hard time trusting your taste in film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film not expecting much more than an average film. The main thing that struck me about this is that all these great actors are having fun. The chemistry between Bruce Willis and John Malkovich is amazing. Morgan Freeman plays his usual likable character, Helen Mirren looks hot and it was great seeing Ernest Borgnine still working.I would love to see the gag reel for this because Malkovich is crazy and I bet he had everyone cracking up.I hate sequels/prequels, re-boots and re-imaginings but amazingly I would love to see a sequel, perhaps the adventure in Moldova alluded to at the end. Willis and Malkovich need to work together again. Recommended 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of a letdown but still entertaining......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer for this, I actually thought this was quite an interesting idea. I mean, how many movies will you see old actors shooting and kicking ass? And since when was the last time you saw Helen Mirren looking elegant and deadly in one movie? This movie doesn't take itself too seriously, which is why it can be enjoyed as a light comedy. The story is simply - ex CIA agents are being targeted by the CIA in place now, and an old bunch of retirees now have to come out of retirement to work together to take down the bad guys.It's a pretty simple plot and is just an excuse to have action scenes showing the ability of the old to kick ass - but it is enjoyable. I did think some of the scenes almost felt a bit cartoonish, and this is what I picked up on. If it is trying to be a satirical comedy, it excels on some levels and fails in others.The love interest of Sarah (Louise Marie Parker) and Bruce Willis character I felt was really boring and her character was a bit unbelievable. I mean, she is this really ordinary person in the beginning then gets thrown into this world of crime, guns and explosions and is suddenly all for it like that. Her character was almost an annoyance, and was simply there as an added subplot.I thought John Malkovich was pretty good as his character who is the ultimate paranoid retiree thinking everything is out to get him (and has reason to). But what was the joy for me was seeing Helen Mirren with a gun - she would have been one of the last actresses I would have thought would star in action films, but here she proves a delight and charm in her own right. Talk about elegance and deadliness all in one.It is entertaining and maybe I was expecting a little more, so I am disappointed. This is a no brainer essentially, but it is good to see a film celebrating its older actors in a film that is usually associated with young punks killing each other and running away from the cops.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The team struck oil on this nonsense action yarn about a conspiracy to eliminate all witnesses of an old CIA operation because it was a cover-up for a man who is now Vice President and running for president.Bruce Willis, ex-CIA, is one of these witnesses and he doesn't want to be liquidated. Neither does Morgan Freeman or John Malkovitch. Helen Mirren signs on with them too. They are all Retired Extremely Dangerous, and they take the offensive after awhile. Willis has hooked up with civilian, Mary-Louise Parker, who is forced into the deadly fray.The film is a wonderful blend of lightness, comic touches and serious action. What a great cast, and my hat's off to the writing team and the director for handling this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A playful action blockbuster with a top-shelf cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't watch Red until after I watched Red 2 (2013) in a theater. It didn't seem interesting to me at first. I watched Red 2 in an auditorium full of adults and was pleasantly surprised. I only watched it to waste some time but Red 2 turned out to be a very funny and enjoyable film. I watched it in the evening and it made my day. So, naturally, the next day I watched Red. I consider it to be just as enjoyable as its sequel. It may be funnier too. Bruce Willis is 59 now but he still manages to shine in the action roles that he picks. He isn't picking anything meaningful, but Live Free Or Die Hard (2007) was one fine action film. The comedy that he shares with Mary-Louise Parker in Red boosts the action at the beginning. However, the film becomes even more enjoyable once John Malkovich jumps out of the bushes. His antics as the wild-eyed paranoid assassin Marvin Boggs just have to be seen. Morgan Freeman, who seems to be in many films these days, plays the canny and loose Joe Matheson. He does well with the clever comedy too. All the main players seem to be having a blast with the weaponry. Helen Mirren more so than others perhaps. She looks elegant in the expensive clothes, even when she's firing a machine gun. The cast is definitely the best feature about Red. Karl Urban acts just as well as the main players, with confidence and style. With Red director Robert Schwentke managed to make what is easily his best film to date. The energetic action scenes that he filmed with cinematographer Florian Ballhaus are stylish and coherent. The downside to Schwentke's direction is the film's awkward pacing, which makes it seem longer than it actually is. This prevents Red from being a truly satisfying action comedy. Still, it's not a big problem. The film looks great, the laughs come often, and the action is exciting. The biggest draw though is certainly the cast of famous actors. This unconventional yet exciting concept gets a high recommendation from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is a retired agent who is stuck in a rut ? his only joy in life is his phone calls to his pension case worker Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), who is as bored with life as he is. When Frank is pulled back into his old line of work, he finds himself responsible for Sarah whilst trying to survive.This film is surprisingly light-hearted entertainment and full of likable characters. Bruce Willis plays his trademark cool, collected role, holding his own during gun fights and car chases, a believable veteran of the genre. Mary-Louise Parker brings a bubbly and inquisitive character that clashes wonderfully with Willis' role which provides an unexpected sweet element to the film. John Malkovich delivers a highly entertaining performance as Willis' partner in crime, offering plenty of laughs throughout the film. There are some great minor roles from Hollywood royalty such as Dame Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, and Brian Cox. The film is all about contrasts, and that doesn't just stop at the characters: there is a fair bit of action, offset by humorous dialogue-heavy scenes. The styling of it is almost like a parody of itself: it doesn't try too hard to be one thing or another, it just throws a lot of things into the mix and goes with it.RED is entertaining and surprisingly comedic, with some great characters portrayed by a good cast. Take it all in with an open mind; it does have a touch of the parody about it, but it cuts it back just enough to be an enjoyable action-fuelled offering.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is one of the films that return to the classic action film structures and the "thriller". Although not a prodigy script, nor seek surprised by its originality, but have all the elements for the use and enjoyment of life, as with "The Expendables" of Stallone, now it has happened again with the film that hand. Clear that although Bruce Willis repeat, this time is not of old stars surrounded bulky muscles, but actors charisma ( Malkovich , Freeman , Helen Mirren ... ) that give the project a much more prestigious feel. The film is based on a famous comic, RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous code) tells the story of an elite group of CIA, who after retiring supremely bored , and are stuck in a plot to kill a list of former intelligence agents. While trying to survive and uncover the real mess, which is forcing them to implement all their years of experience, still have time to fall in love again, remember old friends and enemies, and re-experience the excitement of a single job in the adrenaline is the main attraction. The cast of characters is completed by a clerk of the CIA and a promising young agent, who is in charge of stopping the alleged veterans, which are actually much more dangerous than one might think.It is entertaining, with comic esthetics In short film for all ages: action, fun and entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A group of retired agents team up to save their lives from the government.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An all-star cast, brilliant writing and top-notch special effects, what else can you want from an action film? Red is the perfect action film that strays between the lines of dark comedy and action thriller. Big names such as Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren headline this epic action comedy, all taking on distinctive character roles and creating memorable performances. Bruce Willis takes on the role of Frank Moses, a retired CIA agent who is now being hunted by the government because he is "R.E.D", Retired and Extremely Dangerous. He meets up with his witty pension agent and reunites with his old band of ex-agents to counter-attack the plot against them. John Malkovich does a fantastic job as an LSD ridden ex-agent who's eccentric ways and mannerisms provide the majority of the film's comic relief. Helen Mirren plays a savvy sniper, who is classy but dangerous when it comes to her missions. Morgan Freeman makes an appearance as an ex-agent that still packs a punch. The film is based off a comic series of the same name and has elements of it in the film. The fighting sequences are intricate and fast paced. If you love guns, big guns and really big guns, this is the movie for you. Extensive gunfights and car chases leave the viewer riveted to their seat. The non-stop action and perfect one-liners make R.E.D an instant action classic and an epic adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breezy action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is in the best tradition of the breezy action flick. The locales don't rise to the level of the best Bond, the quips and villains are far from the standard set by Die Hard, but nonetheless, it is jolly good fun to watch.What distinguishes it from many similar films is a competent ensemble cast of A-list actors, and some good ideas on how to use them. For example, Morgan Freeman has a cameo as an 80 year-old terminal cancer patient who dies willingly for his friends as the ultimate deus ex machina. John Malkovich gets some good laughs as the conspiracy theorist armed to the teeth: all of his conspiracies come true.What it shares with similar films is a predictable and improbable concoction of a plot that pits Helen Mirren and Bruce Willis as retired CIA agents against the Vice President of the US (or really, the corrupt industrialist behind the VP). For starters, the Bad Guy could just have stopped after killing a reporter who dug up too much dirt. If he had not started offing the Good Guys, none of them would ever have noticed anything is amiss - end of movie. Then there are the usual situations where a cut to the next scene gets the characters out of impossible situations, the people with dislocated/shot shoulders who fight on like nothing happened, agents with handguns who don't die in a spray of heavy machine gun fire, etc.But these nit-pickings are really irrelevant in such a film. The story breezes along with fewer dull moments as it progresses, the acting is solid as expected from a cast of this caliber. There are nice touches like the animated postcard transitions between locations. And just when you worry that the writers are setting up a lame sequel in Moldova, they deconstruct that idea by reducing it to silliness. A well crafted show good for an entertaining single viewing. If you want plot consistency, go watch a film by Ingmar Bergman or Alfred Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, but nothing memorable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>REDI had seen this before when it first came out, but I didn't remember too much about it. Now I have watched it again I can see what it was forgetful. Don't misunderstand me, I liked it. For me it was just nothing too special.The movie is about 4 retired assassins who find themselves on the hit list so they come out of retirement to save themselves.This is a comedy thriller. Not usually two categories that you get together, but it went well. There was a lot of action which I liked and the relationship the characters had was very good. The characters all liked each other but at some stage of their lives had all tried to kill each other too so there is a lack of trust between them at first. That made for amusing comedy. There was not too much to laugh about in this film though. It was not really laugh out loud funny.The action was great. I loved the fighting scenes and the gun fights. All of it was very well done.The casting was also very good for this. The only doubt I had was with Bruce Willis. Yes, Bruce is getting on a bit, but he still looks quite young so I struggled to see him as someone who would have retired because he was too old. It just didn't seem right to me. Bruce still did a good job though. He is still the action legend that I grew up watching. Other cast members were Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman&#xfeff;, Karl Urban &amp; Mary- Louise Parker. Every one of these actors did a great job and really worked well together. The star of the movie for me though has to have been John Malkovich. His character really was a little crazy and John played it perfectly. He was by far the funniest character in the movie and I enjoyed watching him the most.The only down side to this movie really, as I said at the beginning of this review, is that it is forgetful. There is nothing in this movie that I have not seen before. Yes this is well done and a lot of fun to watch, but there is nothing new in here. The twists were very predictable and there was only one moment in the movie that I did not see coming. Everything else just seemed very safe and straight forward. But it is still good to see for a night in with your friends and you want to watch an action filled movie that you don't really need to concentrate on.I will give this film 6 out of 10."Frank, I never thought I'd say this again. I'm getting the pig!"For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe that there are people who actually take this film seriously - it's obvious from the off that it's a parody of all the action flicks ever made, and such tremendous fun it is to watch, too. I love it when you can see the actors actually having a hard time keeping a straight face - they obviously enjoyed filming it as much as the audience enjoyed watching it. My one complaint is that Morgan Freeman was woefully underused, but John Malkovich totally stole the show - he tends to play crazy characters anyway, but Marvin was marvellous! And it was great to see Ernest Borgnine in a role - it was like a who's who of the Hollywood bible! I recommend Red for anyone who is in the mood for a laugh, coupled with some great, OTT action sequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis plays a retired CIA agent living off government pension. As Frank Moses, the highlight of his lonely suburban life is when conversing with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), a customer service agent handling Frank's pension. By deliberately destroying his pension checks, Frank often uses this as an excuse to call Sarah, thus building on a platonic relationship. A nice little off-beat romantic comedy, right? Wrong! Common now, "Yippee-ka-yay" and all that jazz, this is Bruce Willis we are taking about. So anyway, one quiet evening, just before Frank retires for the night, a hit squad storms through his house but is unable to take him down. As it seems, Frank is Retired, but Extremely Dangerous (RED). Knowing that the hit squad must have watched his every move while tapping his phone calls, Frank heads towards Kansas City before his assailants can bait him with Sarah. Frank then re-assembles his former Black-ops team with the terminally ill Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), the paranoid Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) and former MI6 operative Victoria (Helen Mirren). Together, they learn that they are on a hit list having been involved in a secret mission in Guatemala dating back to 1981. With a CIA crack team led by William Cooper (Karl Urban) hot on their heels, Frank and his old buddies must now hold it together before facing an explosive showdown that involves the Vice-President himself.For what its worth, this is a film that doesn't try to be more than what it sets out to be? an entertaining action comedy. Speaking of action, what can you expect from old timers playing over the hill retired government spooks, right? Wrong Again! At 56, and as the tagline says, Willis still has it. So does 74 year old Freeman along with the Academy Award winning Helen Mirren. For the most part, action scenes are over the top, and in true Hollywood splendor, some scenes are almost ridiculous. Steeping out of a moving vehicle, lining up a shot and then emptying a clip before the vehicle stops spinning is as believable as a snow storm in the amazon. Then again, this is an action comedy after all. Sure enough, Malkovich steals the show while offering some hilarious moments through the film as a paranoid conspiracy theorist. As Marvin, he is insanely funny and brings his unique sarcasm in the form of funny one-liners. Adding on is Freeman with his usual wit and can literally slap you into laughter. Mary-Louise Parker is the unwitting victim in all this and humorously portrays the example of how cautious someone should be when wishing for something. Karl Urban on the other hand, is great as the determined CIA agent, but finds it hard to contain his native Kiwi accent towards the end. Then of course is the lovely and charming Mirren. She is an epitome of grace and screen charisma, even if her character wields the biggest guns in the film.German director Robert Schwentke knows how to make an entertaining film. Known for his 2005 thriller "Flightplan", Schwentke goes all out with Red and fires from all cylinders. Brothers Jon and Erich Hoeber's script is justified by this director while adding his own finesse to their work. At the end of it all is a cloak and dagger and bullets blazing caper that pits together the CIA, KGB, MI6, and the Presidential Secret Service in one entertaining yet explosive farce.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let me say this: I LOVE Bruce Willis. I grew up watching him in the series Moonlighting and the Die Hard movies. His comedic talent is off the charts and his "bad boy with good heart" personality is so sweet and...well, hot :) And the dude has proved he can act in "serious" dramas, too, although it's a known fact that comedies are usually more difficult to get right than dramas.In RED, Bruce that we know and love, the bad boy with a golden heart, makes a return, in the company of some awesome supporting actors! The story is nothing new (but what story is, really?), but well told, and extremely well acted. I loved the direction in this one, the way the different cities they traveled to were introduced, and the soundtrack is spot on! Also, fight scenes do not overshadow the telling of the story, but fit right in with the pace of the narrative.I also saw The Expendables a few weeks ago, but I must say, RED is so much better. Both movies play on the same idea of veteran agents, but RED is so more finely tuned and complex and funnier, and the chemistry between actors is so obvious. Who knew that Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Hellen Mirren can make such great action movie heroes! Mary Louise Parker is so good in the role of the ingénue who goes from a boring 9 to 5 office job to this crazy CIA man-hunt without even blinking! I loved it! All in all, it's a great movie. Just kick back, relax, and let Bruce&amp;Co show you how it's done :)</fullReview>

Willis has a subte nature to his comedy, but it's convincing and likable. Willis forces you to watch him with his subtle quips that he makes look so daringly easy and fun.The cast of Willis, Morgan Freeman, Hellen Mirren, John Malcovich and more collaborate to engage some of the most timely and organic comedic action sequences that I never expected to come about.

		<shortDescription>Undeniably mindless fun perhaps....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do old CIA agents go to retire, well they either get really old and lecherous, go crazy, assimilate into polite society or just get lonely and bored - RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous) Frank Moses (Willis) is going down the lonely route, phoning his pension benefits clerk each week for a chat to chase his benefits cheque (Louise-Parker), all perky nosed and cute. A cheque he has already received, which he deftly rips in half as he talks to her.Following a re-modelling of his house courtesy of the "9 Millimeter" interior design company, Moses gets to meet face to face with his long time phone buddy. Seconds later they are on the run picking up Moses old "Wet Ops" CIA buddies, Joe (Freeman), Marvin (Malkovich) and Victoria (Mirren) as they seek to uncover the truth behind recent events and clear their names.The group is closely followed by the dogged and government authorized assassin William Cooper (Urban), all set to kill Moses for reasons not specified, let alone barely mentioned.Moses of course is trained in everything, adept in the use of weapons, hand to hand combat and Mandarin if and when required. A colossal fight with his younger counterpart inspired partly by being called "Grandpa".The premise is good and with a great cast including Richard Dreyfuss and Brian Cox, this should be a rollicking action comedy, with the oldies kicking serious butt.The tone for such a film is very important, comedy sits very uneasily with brutal action and here the balance is not quite right. Whereas the A-Team is all about fantasy, this skews closer to reality in places and feels uncomfortable at times with the mix of humour and "movie" real life, this is especially true of Marvin's paranoid fantasies.Heavy weapons, gunfire and exploding cars can be fun but this is a heavy hitter cast list and yet we get very few chances to hear or see the interplay between the group. We see the occasional glimpse, a wry Willis smirk or glance from Helen Mirren, admitting the occasional contract on the side as she misses the thrill. The actors are just not utilised enough, why assemble a great cast and then present nameless stuntmen/women perform cool stunts for most of the running time?Of course anything with Mirren firing heavy weaponry with a sardonic grin cannot be all bad but it cannot sustain a 115 minute film on this alone. Hopefully breaking into the Pentagon is easier than having old soviet spy buddies help you out but one ever knows these things for sure.Moses might also be reminded that driving around heavy traffic with a duct taped woman in the back seat, with the world and his wife owning mobile phones, might, just might, raise suspicion? Summary Undeniably mindless fun perhaps but a real let down following the initial trailers and expectation of a character driven film with added action, not the other way round.File under rather disappointing, or alternatively, somewhat wasted opportunity.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Red' is great fun. It's one of those movies, like the Oceans trilogy, where the cast has such a great time filming that it translates onto the screen and you can' t help having a good time with them. That's not to say they have a great time without actually working. The acting is outstanding, even Bruce Willis excels in this one. (Mainly because he's bald? I have a theory on this) Helen Mirren, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Brian Cox and Mary Stuart Masterson (who steals all the scenes she's in) are all uniformly excellent (Well, they would be, woudn't they?) and the supporting cast is magnificent, including Rebecca Pigeon, Karl Urban, Julian McMahon, Ernest Borgnine (He must be in his eighties by now, surely?) and an hilarious Richard Drefyss.

What I didn't expect was how truly great the cast was in its entirety. The story was perfect, the action was well placed and well done and I think Red came so close to being just one of the best action films of the last ten years. Regardless its shortcomings are easily overlooked because of how great and incredibly entertaining the film is. The cast even features a couple of actors who aren't usually on my top ten list who really impressed me but more on that later. The film was based on a graphic novel which I had never heard of but I don't think that matters at all because it made for a good movie. I read some reviews that said Red became too complex which I don't understand at all. I mean action movies are usually blamed for being too shallow and too much action and this film balances everything so incredibly well.Bruce Willis leads the cast as retired CIA agent Frank Moses (the perfect tough guy name.) Willis does what Willis does best...kill bad guys or anyone trying to kill him. Right from the very first scene we know that he is one talented dude retired or not. He channels the old Willis that commands attention on screen and has some great scenes (the best of which is shown in the trailer jumping out of the police car, firing at bad guys as the car swings around.) Mary-Louise Parker is probably the sore thumb of the team. I don't mean that badly because her and Willis have good chemistry and she does give the film a needed youth boost since she has a good decade between her and Willis although she looks much younger. She is good as the fish out of water customer service rep suddenly in with assassins. John Malkovich is sort of acting royalty but I have never been a huge fan. He's always been just too outside the box for me save for a few roles but in Red he is absolutely amazing. His quirky, funny, twisted Marvin Boggs is a role that fits him like a leather suit. He is absolutely perfect and I know I loved him from the moment he quips 'Get the pig' and proceed to carry around a stuffed pig. Helen Mirren jumps way out of her comfort zone to play a more subtle role but still very well done as a hit-woman with an eye for sniping. Her role isn't quite as brazen as the men but she adds class to the cast. Speaking of class Morgan Freeman is a Hollywood god to me. The man is amazing and I was so glad to see him as part of this cast and he has some good scenes. The unfortunate part is that he is the most underused actor on the cast. Finally Karl Urban does a great job as the young talented CIA Assassin charged with killing the RED team. He is excellent and him and Willis have some great chemistry in their scenes where they battle head to head.I expected that when I looked at Robert Schwentke's directing filmography that he would have some heavy action greats to his name but he doesn't!! He has some solid films behind him but nothing in true action fame. If you are an action fan but haven't seen Red you are doing yourself an injustice because Red has everything you could possibly want. I love a good action comedy that can pull it off well and Bruce Willis does that better than anyone using sarcasm and wit and just pure bad ass-ness. Red has it all and if they do sequelize it, it probably won't have the same clout as the original but I'm willing to see them all again because of how great they were!! A worthy addition to my collection. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A terrific movie with great action and terrific premise and exceptional performances. Bruce Willis plays a retired CIA agent who is marked for elimination by some blackops while he is trying to romance the Mary Louise Parker character who is looking for mr right. The action unfolds taking the unlikely duo across America and meeting up with his old partners in the business to solve who is after them. John Malkovich shines in his role as Marvin and he chews up scenery with panache. Helen Mirren, Richard Dreyfus, Brian Cox and Morgan Freeman are also terrific in their roles. Nice also to see Ernest Borgnine in the role of a CIA records keeper. The action is fast and furious and loud and you get a lot of bang in this tight and taut action spectacle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Retired-Extreme-Dangerous - and fabulous!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talk about a great time - 2010's Red is a fun and exciting experience.The film stars Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Mary Louise Parker, Richard Dreyfuss, and Ernest Borgnine. Willis is an ex-black ops CIA agent, Frank, who enjoys talking on the phone with the young woman, Sarah (Mary Louise Parker) responsible for sending his pension checks. However, when he realizes that someone is trying to kill him, he also knows his phone has been bugged and she's in danger. So he kidnaps Sarah and takes her along while he reassembles members of his old team: Joe (Freeman) who is living in a nursing home, Marvin (Malkovich), who is living a bizarre, paranoid existence, and Victoria (Mirren), who seems to be some sort of socialite, and they try to find out why, after all this time of being retired, someone is after Frank, and who is it? Fast-paced, with great performances, Red is funny and fun, with nonstop action. Malkovich is a total scream in the wildest role, as is Mirren, an elegant British lady who is aces with a shotgun. Mary-Louise Parker is great as a woman who reads spy novels and now has a chance to live one, and her chemistry with Willis is wonderful.A total treat. Don't miss this terrific cast in an excellent film, directed by Robert Schwentke and written by Joel and Erich Hoeber, adapted from the graphic novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Different ways to approach this review so let's do something different, lets's try them all.1. On its own, in a vacuum, it is a great film. A dream cast. A great ideal. A tight script. And using Mary Louise Parker as the vehicle to make the audience comfortable with the entire story works well -- she is a wonderfully empathetic character and a great casting choice. This is what film-making is supposed to be. (She also has Cartoon Eyes) OR2. A Hollywood "hi concept" idea finally gets full traction -- taking a handful of A-List actors who are perhaps a little long in the tooth and reminding viewers what made them A-List in the first place. Love it.OR 3. In my reviews I often talk about a "test" no one bothers to try -- second and third viewings. This film gets better with each viewing.OR 4. Go see RED 2 and you will suddenly understand why in comparison this is Citizen Kane. Parker is the focus here, the glue, but in Red 2 she seems more like a prima donna than an innocent that the audience can relate to. Lots of "sour script notes" in Red 2. In comparison, this is a wonderful film, almost perfect entertainment</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>when actors retire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When actors who played spies in action movies get older they have an option. They can start playing roles of retired spies in action movies. At least the best and the luckiest of them. Same is true for westerns or for science-fiction movies, BTW.Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman are all among the good and lucky one. Some of them may have not even crossed the legal age of retirement in these times when the governments push the pensions limit higher for reasons I would not detail here. What counts is that all the members of this 'carre of aces' are in good shape and have fun making us have fun in this story where the renegade and rogue agents are the active ones the the institution one should trust less than any other around is the government. Conspiracy is not a theory, it's a fact of life whose credibility is not placed under question for one second in the script of the film directed by Robert Schwentke. who film after film builds to himself a name of one of the best action film directors in Hollywood and I expect him being trusted with one of more of the never-ending James Bond series entries sometimes in the future.Did I forget somebody? Oh, yes - I should mention Richard Dreyfuss, one of the actors I mostly admired about three decades ago and who seemed to get lost into politics, to the point that I almost did not recognize him here in the retired villain role (sure, villains also retire). One could comment that only Willis is within his usual casting limits, while actors like Malkovich, Mirren, Freeman, or Dreyfuss could do more interesting things and certainly no Oscar was waiting for them behind the corner for the roles in RED, but, hey, this is entertainment, this is an action comedy, one of the genres Hollywood knows how to do well, the guys and the gal are having fun doing it, so get your popcorn and have some fun yourselves watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, Entertaining and Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Contains Spoilers*The underlying reason we watch movies is because they are entertaining, and Red is far the most fun film I have seen in a very long time.I didn't really know much Red before watching it and the short blurb gave no hint to it being a comedy, but what I ended up watching greatly exceeded my expectations. Breaking the plot down it was a little on the thin side but it cleverly uses comedy and of course lots of explosions to keep things going and it all fits together perfectly.Some of the one liners are brilliant and the action scenes are no less over the top than I'd hoped for. Pretty much every action film cliché is there but they are all used to the films advantage.Willis, Malkovich, Mirren and Morgan Freeman who put in good performances. Malkovich kept the comedy train moving along while Willis was in his element and although Morgan Freeman was great it was a shame he wasn't in more of the film. However Mary-Louise Parker stole the show for me. I haven't seen her in a great deal but I'm going to have to go back through her filmography, she was great and for me probably the one of the most likable characters in a long time.It's hard to describe the Red experience, it's not a film that is going to have you guessing what is going to happen next but it's enjoyable from start to finish. It's a holiday that you don't remember for where you were but more for the great time you had with your friends while there.A great film that comes with my highest possible recommendations 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly, Sick And-But Very Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the first half of this film, then it got a little silly with the predictable Hollywood anti-CIA/government agenda but, overall, it was still a very entertaining film with wild characters. It's definitely something not to be taken the least bit serious, just enjoyed as a dark comedy with a fast-moving story and a good amount of action and intrigue.John Malkovich - no surprise - steals the show with his wacked-out, paranoid character "Marvin Boggs." Like Johnny Depp, Malkovich is very good at playing strange-but-always-interesting characters.As mentioned, the messages are suspect, to say the least (i.e. professional killers are good guys once they aren't connected to a country. Heck, that's what are here and they just love killing, especially the old lady in this film played by the hard-looking Helen Mirren.) The cast is extremely deep and they're all fun to watch, not just Malkovich. Silliness aside, it's still an enjoyable film that thoroughly entertains, from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of hype got me somewhat interested in this movie, even though I don't appreciate it, I still figure that most audiences can't be wrong. Now I use the word "most" very loosely because I think that most people see the film in a theater first with an audience and admitingly while in a movie theater you want to have a good time and seeing your friends or family laughing influences you just as easily. But I rented this one because I figured if it's that good, I'm sure I'll enjoy it at home just the same, only not so much with my experience. The film certainly isn't bad, but it isn't that good either, I've seen this plot way too much: normal girl falls for guy and finds out he's a former CIA agent and now her life depends on him, blah blah blah. The thing that could have saved this movie big time was the cast and about 70% of the cast is perfect. I would say that Bruce Willis, John Malovich, Helen Mirren and Brian Cox were perfectly cast, but Morgan Freeman's talent was a waste as he's not really apart of the movie so much so that role could have had a less known actor who needs a break. Also Mary Louise Parker who started off as one of the main characters quickly gets the cut off after we meet the rest of the cast and she looks way too young to be the love interest of Bruce Willis even though he's only 10 years her senior. But why would they loose track of the main character? Because they just didn't know where to go with the story.Frank Moses, a former CIA agent, is now living a quiet life in retirement. However, he begins to feel lonely and often chats on the phone with Sarah, a customer service agent working for Frank's pension office in Kansas City. His life is disrupted when a hit squad raids his house in the middle of the night. Frank kills the assassins and, knowing they would have tapped his phone, goes to Kansas City to protect Sarah. She becomes Frank's reluctant companion while he tries to find out who is trying to kill him, and track down his old black ops team for help. Frank first goes to find his mentor Joe, who tells him that the hit squad Frank killed were also responsible for the murder of a news reporter. They then track down Marvin Boggs, a paranoid conspiracy theorist, to provide more information. Marvin tells them that the names on the list are all connected to a secret mission in Guatemala. With the help of Russian secret agent Ivan Simanov, Frank and Sarah infiltrate the CIA headquarters to steal the file and find out more of who is setting the old team up and why.My main thing is that the film relied too much on it's humor. I loved John Malkovich and it's great to see him in a great comeback performance like this one and he pulled in the comic relief, that should have been it. The whole "senior citizen" joke got old really fast as again we've seen it before. Karl Urban's character started off interesting because he's kept a mystery but then we learn about his family and all of a sudden he's a good guy and becomes bland and predictable. I feel bad because the film isn't bad by any means, there are some great moments like John Malkovich thinking that this lady is a spy randomly and seeing how paranoid he is was too funny. Helen Mirren with a machine gun was also very awesome, though she should have done it dressed as Queen Elizabeth, that would have made it more funny. This movie is exactly what I did, a rental, it wasn't anything special but is a good afternoon's movie. It just could have been a lot more.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah...Alright</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Schwentke's 'Red' is an average cinematic experience that fell short of my expectations. The reason? The mostly uninspiring Screenplay, that appeals in bits and pieces. Action scenes are good, so are some performances, but this box office hit lacks soul &amp; the fast-paced energy one expects from it.'Red' is about a yesterday team of CIA's agents gearing up, after an old rival decides to bump them off, as he feels they know a lot about him. Thus the seniors go, no holds barred, to get their nemesis down! To give it's due, 'Red' does hold appeal. The problem is that, the writing in the first 20-25 minutes is very loose and doesn't engage. The film actually begins after John Malkovich's entry, and remains steady. But the climax, is a letdown. Robert Schwentke tries his best to rise above the disappointing screenplay with his able direction, while Florian Ballhaus's Cinematography carries a look. The Editing is just fine.Performance-Wise: Bruce Willis gets the highest screen time, and he seems to be pipped up. Morgan Freeman doesn't get much to do, while Thespian Helen Mirren enjoys her part. John Malkovich is excellent. He truly steals the show. Mary-Louise Parker does a fair job. Brian Cox is hugely amusing. Karl Urban is very sincere. Richard Dreyfuss, after a long time, seems to be in command. Julian McMahon is wasted.On the whole, 'Red' is half-baked, harmless entertainment, at best. Watch it, if you must!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull moments? Code RED.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>October 2010. If movies about social networking sites and mishmashes are what passes for "A truly cinematic experience" nowadays, I guess you could count me out. That is, until I noticed that a movie I never saw any trailers for, and full of stars, called RED was out. Easily taken in before I read anything about its plot, I went and saw it. That blind watch I'm definitely proud of! RED is clichéd in terms of story- a retired agent has his house destroyed by a secret agency and makes for the next state, picking up some friends along the way in an all-out, over-the-top action adventure. But as cliché as it is, RED is also just fun. We have Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis (in the tough guy role as usual), the chick from Weeds, Helen Mirren- all are fantastic. There's plenty of over-the-top action that's fun, it's hilarious, and overall it's a fun movie if all you ask for is just some pure escapist fun.In the end, RED is definitely not art or Oscar material, but it is one of the most fun movies of 2010, and recommended for some pure entertainment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a party!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what you may call an action comedy. The story is simple, revolving round a list of a handful (less than 10) retired (but Extremely Dangerous, hence "R.E.D.") CIA agents picked off one after another. The protagonist, one of the few remaining ones, escapes narrowly and ends up with a team of five (not all of them on the list) to get to the bottom of it. There's probably nothing that you have not seen, from standard action sequences, to acceptable plot line, to customary laughs and wisecracks. The real fun is all in the people, and they are obviously having a hell of a party.Leading the cast is Brice Willis. While in a familiar role of an over-the-hill tough guy, his persona here is quite different from in many others you have seen before, which were world-weary, bitter, anti-social. Here, Frank Moses is stoic, conforming (put out Christmas decorations as soon as he sees his neighbours') and, while obviously bored, is doing something about it ? trying to pick up a woman for a relationship, long-term too, so it seems.John Malkovitch, as Marvin Boggs, steals the show with his neurotic CIA retiree who is always under the impression that everybody is trying to kill him and wants to kill everybody?.and turns out to be right most of the time! He keeps asking Frank "Can I kill him/her now?" in exactly the same tone as a little boy asking his parents "can I eat this cake now"? Helen Mirren plays the toughest of them all, Victoria (no last name), who specialized in killing people (designated CIA assassin) and finding life after retirement a little too quiet, takes odd assignments ? "it's not easy to change your lifestyle", she explains. Mirren, I venture to guess, probably took a pay cut to make sure she got this role.Veteran Brian Cox plays Ivan Simanov the Russian spy who once had a Romeo-Juliet type of love affair with Victoria. It warms the heart to see that rekindled but most importantly, of course, to see it played out between Mirren and Cox.Morgan Freeman plays the oldest of the five, Joe Matheson, who also conveniently has terminal cancer. For plot line requirements of poignancy and heroism, someone needs to die. But then, Freeman's character get to die TWICE, and even if he has not been allotted with much screen time, Morgan is always a pleasure to watch.If Freeman is old, how about Ernest Borgnine who, at 93, bring just as much joy and pleasure in his small role here as Eli Wallach (who is 2 years older!) in Wall Street: Money never sleeps.Not old, but certainly an old-timer is Richard Dreyfuss who plays THE villain, with enough stage presence to spare. Another key role, a young and ambitious CIA agent who treads the thin line between good and bad guy, is admirably played by Karl Urban whom I'll always remember as Eomer in the LOTR Trilogy. Mary-Louise Parker, seen recently in family fantasy "The Spiderwick Chronicles" as a young, agonized mother, is the female lead in a Sandra Bullock type of role, parrying and flirting quite capably with Willis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AARP vs the CIA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite an obscure acronym for its title, "Red" is a wildly entertaining live-action cartoon. Logic and reality vanish early on, and the audience embarks on an imaginative ride through CIA-conspiracy-paranoia territory. The CIA is assassinating a list of operatives from a covert operation in Guatemala. Retired agent, Bruce Willis, is awakened from a dreary life of chatting about lost checks with a Social Security administrator, Mary-Louise Parker, and solicits aid to solve the murders from several equally retired former compatriots. The geezer quotient in "Red" is extremely high, and AARP could use the film to promote how exciting life can be after retirement. Led by 55-year-old Bruce Willis, the rough retirees include 73-year-old Morgan Freeman, 56-year-old John Malkovich, 64-year-old Brian Cox, and 65-year-old Helen Mirren. Not content with this stellar cornucopia of seasoned performers, director Robert Schwentke enlists 63-year-old Richard Dreyfuss and 93-year-old Ernest Borgnine, who looks thirty years younger, in supporting roles. With four Oscars and decades of experience between them, the cast is expectedly superior to the material.However, the engaging plot, based on a graphic novel by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner, is often amusing and moves at a breakneck speed that shatters stereotypes of senior citizens. Thirty-eight-year-old Karl Urban, who plays Willis's adversary, CIA agent William Cooper, comes up bloodied and winded against his elders. The film appears to have been shot all over the U.S., and the clever use of postcard inserts keeps the audience aware of the settings, even if the scene changes occasionally confuse the players. "Red" benefits most from its exceptional cast. Willis plays Willis in his best "Die Hard" mode; Malkovich plays Malkovich in his amusing wacko mode; and Mirren plays the proper English lady who serves tea, arranges flowers, and occasionally kills people. Like the audience, Parker is initially caught up unwillingly in the mayhem, but her lust for adventure takes hold and she begins to enjoy the ride. While perhaps not a classic, "Red" is nonetheless a good action film that delivers, and a trove of outstanding actors that have aged like fine wine appear to be having a great time and supplementing their Social Security checks at the same time.</fullReview>

The movie will make you wonder, "How did they do that explosion?" The movie will also make you sleep because the story is devoid of anything that even remotely challenges the intellect. If you want slapstick-like action, then this movie is for you. If you want a movie with lots of noise, then this movie is for you.

		<shortDescription>Think "Space Cowboys" for the CIA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The conceit of this movie is that a group of retired ex-agents for the CIA can out-gun,out fight, and out-everything current employees, all without mussing Helen Mirren's coiffure. Think "Space Cowboys" for the CIA.Overall, the movie works. The script by Jon and Eric Hoeber is excellent. Someone required that Bruce Willis's (age 55) love interest be a younger woman, so they cast Mary-Louise Parker (age 46), which is not as bad a stretch as I expected from Hollywood. "RED" also stars Helen Mirren (65), Morgan Freeman (73), John Malkovich (57), Richard Dreyfuss (63), and Brian Cox (64), with a cameo by Ernest Borgnine (93). Karl Urban (28) played the poor current agent opposing all that goodness.This is definitely an action film for the Ensure set, but the action probably will work for all ages. It's way over the top. People are blown up non-gorily in towering infernos of flame and smoke. Our heroes never kill any good guys, although they will stoop to knocking them silly. Willis does his patented smirk, and Malkovich pretty much steals every scene he's in with a loony-tunes character that many actors would die for, but few could do.The gist of the plot is that a number of retired agents have been marked for termination with extreme prejudice, and Willis, Freeman, and Malkovich are on the list. Willis finds out the connection was an extraction in Guatemala, and he puts together the team of retirees (marked R.E.D. by the CIA - Retired, Extremely Dangerous). Parker gets pulled in because she knows Willis and happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The aging -- no, make that aged -- former agents kill the bad guys, blow things up, and generally have a whooping good time talking about the old days and how much tougher things were in their youth. I was worried about Mirren being able to pull it off as a killer with automatic weapons, but she handled it with graceful aplomb.The violence is so over the top it's cartoonish (think "Home Alone" violence cranked up more decibels than you care to hear), and when our heroes are shot, it's touch and go for as long as the script needs to tug our heartstrings, then the next scene they're fully recovered and in another fight. Nothing is to be taken seriously, and the script is fast-paced and witty. Not a great movie, but a very good one.</fullReview>

The first action sequence in Red is so over-the-top ridiculous that it went far beneath even the worst of the genre. And as far as comedies go this was second rate, at best.When the Willis character finds out on the phone that his friend had died it would have been hilarious if the woman on the other end had said, "Sorry, Mr. Morgan Freeman decided to bail out of this piece of crap movie. You're on your own, baldy." I gave up on the movie a little after John Malkovich dropped in. Why would I care about what will next?

		<fullReview>Red. Was a better ensemble cast put together last year just for laughs? Oh sure, there were great ensemble movies last year, but most gave the feeling that they just wanted to get Oscar love. Some succeeded (The King's Speech), some failed (Another Year). But I don't remember a movie where a group of excellent actors got together just to have some fun. There was The Expendables, but no one really considers Dolph Lundgren and Jet Li great, right? They're nowhere near the league of Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, Jon Malkovich, Mary Louise Parker, Richard Dreyfuss, Ernest Borgnine, and Brian Cox, who all lent their talent to Robert Schwentke's mediocre action comedy and made it one of last year's sleeper hits. And let's have no doubts: Red is nothing but the triumph of its cast of veteran actors, who are so good they brought magnificence to a screenplay that had nothing. Logic gets shell-shocked amidst the explosions, cool one-liners define shallow personalities, and as for the plot holes, how can they exist if there isn't a plot anyway? The more I think about Red, and I've been thinking about it since around last Christmas, the more its flaws stand out like big pustules on a forehead and the less I care. This is not a movie to look for mistakes or to complain about plot holes. This is a movie of simple, guilty pleasures: Malkovich behaving like a paranoid conspiracy nut, Helen Mirren mowing bad guys down with a Gatling gun, etc. We know we want to watch this, right? Based on a comic book by Warren Ellis and Cully Hammer, Red stars Bruce Willis as Frank Moses, a retired CIA hit-man targeted for assassination because some journalist started investigating an operation that happened decades ago and that no one remembers anymore. But Moses was part of that operation and someone wants to eliminate all the witnesses and people connected to it. This has been done to death. Let's move on. A team of hit men turns Moses' house into a Swiss cheese, but he gets rid of them with the gracefulness that only Willis can muster when playing an action hero. Next he gets on the road with Sarah (Parker), a woman he meets on the phone when he calls the government pension processing centre. She's the only person he can trust, they're in love, etc., tick the romantic subplot box. What's next on the list? Moses needs someone to help him, so he contacts the rest of his crew that was involved in that vague operation that happened a long time ago: the LSD-soaked paranoid Marvin (Maklovich), Joe (Freeman), living in a retirement home, and Victoria (Mirren), who still takes hit jobs because old habits die hard. Their plan: kill their way through a conspiracy that involves the US Vice-President and the military-industrial complex. It's a big, nonsensical plot that, just for nostalgia's sake, hearkens back to simpler times when South America was teeming with CIA black ops and the Cold War still existed. A "realistic" thriller by Paul Grengrass this is not.Red has absolutely nothing new in terms of ideas. It brings nothing new to the genre. Red has slick, self-aware action sequences. Characters perform humanly impossible feats like gracefully sliding out of a car in movement or hitting an incoming rocket with a revolver. The movie asks us to ignore this and we happily do because we don't want to ruin the fun. But in the back of our heads we keep telling ourselves that we've seen this approach to action countless times in any movie starring Jason Statham.What the movie really has in its favour is the superb cast, whose familiarity eliminates the need for character development. They have the personalities we expect from their type-cast screen personas. We all know Willis will play a super-duper, cool as ice tough guy with a heart of gold. Malkovich does his creepy-crazy thing he did so well in Con Air. Freeman, that serene narrator, is the voice of reason. And Mirren is the personification of upper-class grace with a gun and killing instincts. She's a Bond girl if Bond girls lived to retirement age.The actors just feed off each other, their chemistry is spotless. Even if Malkovich steals every scene he's in with his paranoid antics, everyone works to complement someone else. What we get is a movie full of hilarious interrelationships which prodigiously mask the countless flaws of direction and lack of originality in the screenplay. Watch it, have fun with it and then don't think about it ever again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised with this film. Yes, I did choose to see it but it was better than I expected. The movie has a good, easy to follow story, loads of action, humor, and a tad bit of romance.Bruce Willis was the selling point for me to see this film originally but John Malkovich was great. He truly stole every scene he was in. I wish he were to get nominated for a Best Supporting Actor at The Acadamy Awards, but, knowing them, they'll nominate a bunch of dudes from movies we've never heard of. Morgan Freeman was good (as always) even though he only had about 15 minutes of screen time. Helen Mirren and Mary Louise-Parker were both very good as the femme fatale and Karl Urban did his usual "I'll look mad for the next 2 hours" routine that he also used in "LOTR 2 &amp; 3", "The Bourne Supremacy", and "Star Trek". I also enjoyed the surprise appearances of Brian Cox and Richard Dreyfuss, who both played crucial roles in the film. Brian Cox is a real versatile actor and doesn't get the recognition that he deserves.I'd recommend this movie to people 15 or older who enjoy, action-humor movies, old people, machine guns, or John Malkovich. Really hoping for a sequel (which Michael Caine and Jon Voight should audition for).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familiar faces help "RED" beat formula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No genre has defined 2010 like the group-centric comedy-infused action flick that pits betrayed special agents/soldiers against "the man." So the only chance "RED" had at standing out was to rise above the formula at the hands of an acting core whose mean age would qualify for a senior discount to see said film. In honesty, it doesn't succeed at being more special, but what "RED" achieves that many of its kin this year did not is pull it off with a definitive sense of class.Although hardly as hysterical as it ought to have been, "RED" combines likable faces and smart direction well enough so that the recycled premise doesn't nag at you for too long. Robert Schwentke ("Flightplan," "The Time Traveler's Wife") takes the style of the film in various directions from goofy action comedy to more serious revenge thriller, but the key is that he never crosses the line into eye-rolling territory; no one walks away from an explosion his film.Bruce Willis stars as retired CIA operative Frank Moses, whose existence has been reduced to phone conversations with the woman that sends him his government check (Mary-Louise Parker). That changes quickly when Frank's home is reduced to Swiss cheese by the very agency he worked for. Realizing he and this "woman" are in jeopardy, he kidnaps her and while on the run, finds his old friends (other retired agents) to piece together what's going on. The gist is that Frank's been deemed "Retired, Extremely Dangerous" because he's still got some juice left in the tank and the government ? as per usual these days ? has some dirty laundry to which Frank is connected.The mess leads Frank to attempt to break into Langley and eventually try and kill the vice president of the United States ? which should give you a sense that much of the film is "old(er) guys kicking ass." Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren all join the fray as retired-but-deadly compadres when Frank enlists their help.They're a likable group; even for those with a smaller Malkovich threshold will enjoy him playing the insane, paranoid character and Freeman and Mirren flaunt their usual charms. At the same time, with Malkovich as the exception, the group is more lovable than hysterical ? as much as you expect them to play against type, they don't really, though Mirren with a machine gun is refreshing. It's part of the dual nature of "RED;" sometimes its focused on comedy and amusing action and other times more serious action coupled with dramatic performance.As for the "young-uns," Parker, famous for her starring role on Showtime's "Weeds," manages to bring a unique flavor to the role of "clueless female lead stuck in the vortex of bullets and explosions against her will initially but not later in the film." Karl Urban ("Star Trek") plays the usually not-so-distinguished role of CIA agent hunting the REDs down, except he actually has a multi-dimensional story line. Jon and Erich Hoeber's script was a good find for Urban, whose star will continue to rise."RED" also has a wealth of cameos from beloved older actors that much like the rest of the film, aren't hysterical, but make the film ultimately more enjoyable. Whereas many films based on comics are aiming now for lesser-known talents and conventional thought says that packing a film with a ridiculous amount of stars is overkill, "RED" comes out and proves once again that there's great comfort in a familiar face, especially seasoned veterans. We enjoy seeing them have fun with less sophisticated roles, even if their performances don't rate with the anticipation of them crossing a genre line. Without a doubt, however, it makes today's most used and abused Hollywood action formula much more tolerable.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It becomes what it promises it won't be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't help but smile when I saw the trailers for RED. The idea of retired CIA agents struggling to find meaning in a bloodless life is the stuff of great satire. I like that Willis has the guts to delve into self parody and I like that the film deals with age in a comedic and yet rooted way. The problem with RED is that it promises to be a parody of the action film and the action character and instead it becomes a rather boring action film that we have seen hundreds of times before. This film about being over the hill is inhabited by characters who didn't get the memo.I think the casting of the lead role of Frank Moses could have been done better. Don't get me wrong I love Bruce Willis and he may be my favorite of the crop of action stars. The problem though is that Bruce Willis is merely playing Bruce Willis. The beginning of the film is inspired. Willis' Moses is bored out of his mind and occupies his time with mundane chores of suburbia. Seeing Willis' cold blooded killer put out an illuminated Frosty for Christmas is brilliant satire. When the film get's going it becomes a boring action film with comedy that seems stupid. Willis is playing every character he ever played and no inclination of that boredom or aging is incorporated into this performance. A pity given that this subplot was done very well by Willis in his film Surrogates. I've seen Willis shoot down bad guys before but why not show him shoot down bad guys with a bad back? Why not show him not getting the same rush from the kill? Moses is back on the saddle as if he never left it without any time to dust the old girl off and isn't this what we were led to believe RED would be about? Wouldn't it have been a more interesting film had Malkovich and Willis traded roles? Malkovich looks like crap in this film and yet he still more or less performs the same action feats as Willis does.I can't fault Bruce Willis for being Bruce Willis because I truly do enjoy him. I somewhat expected this might happen and wasn't really all that surprised that it did. I thought that the picture might be saved by it's supporting ensemble cast. Malkovich is good but the rest aren't. Am I wrong in saying that Morgan Freeman has been reduced to being a walking stereotype? I mean this guy has single handedly created and propped up the modern 'magic Negro' role. Freeman is here to mentor Willis whom he still refers to as kid. Why? Isn't Willis old enough to be Freeman's counterpart rather than his under? This performance is rung in by Freeman and I have to say it is the worst one he has ever given. I would kill to see Freeman play a villain. Helen Mirren looks like she is having a blast but she also is chewing the scenery tremendously. This performance is way too over the top to ever be taken seriously. Sure it's a comedy but comedy stems from some level of individual reality. Helen doesn't seem to give any sense of motivation to this character other than she is meant to look sexy(or as sexy as you might expect an aging Helen Mirren to look) and blow things up. It's kind of funny but not nearly funny enough to warrant cardboard cut out characterization. Brian Cox plays Ivan a former KGB type who joins the gang out of mutual respect for each other. Ivan and Moses trade stories and scars and it is revealed that Ivan is Mirren's Victoria's former lover. Great! Motivation and conflict playing off of and parodying antiquated Cold War silliness. Mirren uses none of it but Cox does and gives a much better performance because of it. Malkovich is my favorite performance in the film simply because he is having fun but is also in tune with his character.If the straight action route was the one to be taken than a villain is necessary and RED doesn't have one. Richard Dreyfuss kind of fills in the role but he is quickly dispatched. RED doesn't work as a straight action film without a villain and there are so many amble opportunities to create one. Why not have another aged agent serve as a rouge? Malkovich's Martin seems to suggest that the old grudges are still there. Wouldn't it be funny to have the entire conflict be based off of problems that should have been forgotten years ago. In the end the villain is the Vice President of the United States and his handlers. I was really expecting and hoping for a Cheney parody but alas the film isn't that clever.RED is a standard action film wrapped in the classic action film package using the classic action film recipe. It has some clever moments but even the most tedious action films usually do. RED is actually a great trap because it lures us in with the bait of freshness and I fell for it. The action genre needs a young hero or else Willis will actually have to face his own mortality and age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous piece of rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing some pretty good things about this movie, I was horribly disappointed. Bruce Willis I can understand....Richard Dreyfuss, yes. And John Malkovich I can somewhat comprehend since he was playing his usual whacked-out role.But Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman? What on earth possessed these fine actors to appear in a film that was nothing more than over-the-top, shoot-it-up, totally contrived and uninteresting material? I have to laugh at the memory of the glamorous Ms Mirren draped in an elegant floor-length evening gown, wielding an enormous machine gun and donning combat boots. Get the picture? Actually, you'd be better off not getting the picture. When the movie opened, the first 20 minutes had me captivated as it looked as though it would turn out to be a well-made film with a different type of angle.Then I thought it must be developing into a spoof ("Airplane" style, perhaps) ... then I sank into the realization that it was really just trying too hard to impress and that the film-makers were quite impressed by themselves with the mediocre script, ridiculous antics and very expensive production.Once John Malkovich makes an appearance, it's time to head for the door.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few DC Comic book films that is intentionally funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like any human being, we all get old at some point. As our body age, we don't always have the same capability to perform the usual tasks we take on during the day. However when it comes to action related films, that concept doesn't exist as much. Characters have much more freedom to be highly skilled in their older age and still manage to be quite agile. The tone that is used in these films are more serious than comedic. Rarely is the subject of age conveyed in a more comic relief tone. Considering that in the year 2010, DC and Warner Brothers had only found success in making dark, serious comic book movies, it didn't seem likely that a movie of a lighter inflection would be made. Mind you this was also before the failed introduction of Hal Jordan in Green Lantern (2011), changing the formula seemed risky. Yet, as obscure as the comic book was, RED (2010) was a surprise hit after viewers saw it. Other than the campy Batman films directed by Joel Schumacher, there were few other DC comic book films of similar tone until this one.The title to this action comedy is actually an acronym that describes the protagonists; RED is short for "Retired, Extremely Dangerous". Viewers are introduced to Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) a retired veteran agent of the field looking to do something with himself but can't figure out what. After being attacked one night in his home, Moses brings along Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker), a friendly phone operator in order to keep her safe. While on the road, they also reconnect with the rest of the team; cool man Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), crazy paranoid man Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) and Eagle-eye Victoria (Helen Mirren). Together they look to find why they're being hunted, while the hunter himself named Cooper (Karl Urban) works endlessly to stop them. Jon and Erich Hoeber, two writers that do not have much consistency in their projects penned the screenplay adapted from the comic book. For this particular entry though, this has been their most widely acclaimed work.Having older agents come back into the field and still be lethal is a nice idea and the actors cast for those roles fit them well. The whole conspiracy subplot that involves the main characters can get wordy at times but it is understandable to some degree. The real problems are unsolved questions that appear throughout the movie. Things happen where it wasn't revealed at all and no answer was given by the conclusion. What's the point of that? Nonetheless, the actors themselves work well with the parts they were cast for. Willis, Mirren, Malkovich and Freeman all have acceptable chemistry with each other. This is perhaps one of the few times where Willis doesn't have to act so tough all the time in order to crack a smile. Even Mary-Louise Parker has a good number of quips for how strange Willis' character acts at first. Although the fact that the role of Sarah is somewhat a love interest to Frank is a tad cliché in itself, the real question is, who thought Parker and Willis looked good together? They aren't ages apart but Willis looks too old.John Malkovich's part is not an uncommon role, and being that his character is a little nutty, it fits right in. Marvin Briggs is the most comedic of the bunch being that he gets anxious to kill. On the other hand, Morgan Freeman slips away with his character practically just being himself but slicker. As for Helen Mirren, her part comes across delicate on the outside and a brutal sniper on the inside. Heck, Mirren doesn't even blink when she fires her weapons. Karl Urban as Cooper is another dangerous agent and although he's mostly cruel, he does have a human side to him. There's also other appearances from other actors like Richard Dreyfuss, Ernest Borgnine, Brian Cox and James Remar. For action, there are a number of sequences that are quite energetic. With the premise involving secret agents trained to kill, one would expect to have plenty of gunplay and explosive activity, of which it does. Throughout the running time, guns range from revolvers to powerhouse machine guns. Not to mention all the hand-to-hand combat too.Florian Ballhaus handled the cinematography for this film. The shots themselves were well executed but the look itself isn't that impressive. There wasn't much of a visual style to this film. There's not even a whole lot of director Robert Schwentke's "snap-zoom" movements, which is a pretty awesome trademark feature. The picture is wide and does get a number of urban landscapes but it's just not much to look at or to be fascinated with. One would think since Ballhaus has worked on movies like The Devil Wears Prada (2006) and Marley &amp; Me (2008), there would be some kind of appeal. The musical score composed by Christophe Beck is another enjoyable listening experience. Much of Beck's composition mixes his usual sounds of bongos and drums with several different cues. These cues switch between guitar and clicky electronic synths that help elevate the action sequences when necessary. Also with Beck having experience in making music for comedy films, mingling action and comedic cues would make perfect sense coming from his perspective.The title is obscure just like its comic book origins, but it is one of the few comedic adaptations in the DC canon. The cinematography isn't unique nor is every question answered, but the actors are well cast, the action is fun, the music is great addition and the comedy is well timed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film shows Bruce waking up and opening mail, the film also shows him talking to a woman on the phone who is talking about the CIA. The bed stand has a couple of novels next to it.Is the movie actually real or is it an actual dream/fantasy dreamt up by Bruce's character? In reality he is a boring mild manner bloke, who phones a phone chat line, becomes involved and caught up with this women's novels and the story tells his dream sequence where he actually thinks that he is ex CIA.I think it would be an interesting concept for Red 3 where in the end he wakes up, to realise that he has only been dreaming these events.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was shown Red back in 2010. I had no interest in watching it, but when I finally did, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this movie is filled with hilarious and action packed moments. The casting was well done. Having Bruce Willis cast as Frank Moses was a great move and having other well known names such as Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich was a nice touch. Mary Louise-Parker was great in the character of Sarah, but my favorite character of them all was by far Marvin. He said most of the jokes and I found that him being a crazy, aging man was the perfect role for John Malkovivh. Red was one of the few action/comedy movies that kept true to it's title. Never once during the entire movie did I find that the movie had changed directions and abandoned what it promised to be. The final few scenes were shot near perfectly, with such a well thought-out finale to this movie being the best part. If you have enjoyed other Bruce Willis films or want to have a few good laughs in an action movie, I cannot recommend this film more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best action packed DC Comic book movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take an action packed comedy movie filled with humor than ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Red (2010) is a great action packed comedy movie with humor in it. It is one of my favorite movies with Bruce Willis! This was the second movie that was based on DC comics I see of the duelogy. I always thought that Red 2 was better than this but I was wrong. This movie entertained me back and than, and I have enjoyed very much. This is one of the best movies you will ever see. It is way better than it's sequel Red 2. The cast is great, along with the plot. Very funny in parts and very serious in others. It's on both ends of the genre spectrum. If you buy this movie, I am 98% sure you will be extremely impressed. Some movies are works of art, but some movies are just fun to watch. RED is a fun movie. It taps into the baby boomer generation and may not be as much fun to the younger set, but I recommend this movie to anyone.I have enjoyed this movie so mu8ch. So many gifted actors willing to make light of their growing older. How could you not enjoy the interaction between Mirren, Freeman, Malkovich and Willis? Karl Urban (Star Trek, Bourne Supremacy) continues to show such versatility as an actor. No, there's not deep-seated truths about life here, simply a fun escape from reality. Definitely worth the viewing. There was a lot of action, comedy and great performances by the actors. The acting in this movie was believable and awesome. Karl Urban as William Cooper did an outstanding job! This is one of those that didn't really interest me at all when it came out in theaters. But after watching it twice in the row I was very impressed! The pacing felt draggy and the off-beat sense of humor felt too quirky for me. I was kind of bored and totally expected this. All of a sudden, BANG! The action erupts in the house and Bruce Willis is kicking their ass with his brawn and brains. The story really started to come alive and that''s only the beginning. The movie got better and funnier as it went along. The action sequences were surprisingly intense and bad-ass, there were some hilarious scenes that caught me off guard and the whole cast was terrific. From Bruce Willis' leading hero to Helen Miriam feisty female fettle that she plays so well to Morgan Freedman''s great typecast role to John Malkovich''s paranoid, trigger-happy C.I.A retiree that steals the show more than once to Karl Urban''s bad-ass wild card agent all the way to Richard Dreyfuss' cool mobster a-hole, they all deliver convincing, if sly, performances; they know what kind of movie they are doing and go with it. Not all of this is realistic and given level of limited plausibility and ridiculousness of the plot, this could have gone either way. But in all my surprise, this was a fun action-comedy with enough laughs and action to kill some good time over a weekend.Frank (Bruce Willis), Joe (Morgan Freeman), Marvin (John Malkovich) and Victoria (Helen Mirren) used to be the CIA's top agents - but the secrets they know just made them the Agency's top targets. Now framed for assassination, they must use all of their collective cunning, experience and teamwork to stay one step ahead of their deadly pursuers and stay alive. To stop the operation, the team embarks on an impossible, cross-country mission to break into the top-secret CIA headquarters, where they will uncover one of the biggest conspiracies and cover-ups in government history.That is the main basic plot it has CIA agents in it and lots of actions, lot's of guns are used in here and the gun powder are great. I love this movie and it is a 10 for me.Red is the 2010 action comedy loosely based on the Wildstorm limited comic book series of the same name. Bruce Willis stars as Frank, a former CIA operative who has been designated by the agency as RED (Retired, Extremely Dangerous). When he discovers that he's been targeted for assassination, Frank then recruits some of his former colleagues to find out who is behind the conspiracy. The film co-stars John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Karl Urban, Morgan Freeman, Mary-Louise Parker and Ernest Borgnine.

		<shortDescription>RED... 2011 movie review.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RED stars Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich and Morgan Freeman. It is a comedy mixed with action and adventure with a touch of romance. The general plot of the movie is Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) gathering his old black-ops team together so they can uncover the pieces and figure out who put the hit on them and so that they can survive. RED, Retired Extremely Dangerous, is an acronym for this group of retired agents. The movie has many unexpected twists and turns and keeps the audience's attention throughout the story. This movie can go for guys or girls. There is lots of action, fancy high powered guns and cameo, designer clothing, romance, and very special pig. The filmmakers choreographed intense and graphic blow-up scenes that kept the movie rolling. One moral in the movie is to 'respect your elders'.Marvin (Malkovich) is extremely upset when someone calls him an 'Old Man.' Each member of the group has worked their entire lifetime for the CIA and feels that they have earned respect for the jobs that they have completed in their careers. Even though RED is a high action movie, it contains a lot comedy. the character are ex-CIA assassins and they're quite lovable. It's interesting on how each different personality works together to make the team successful. Overall this movie is a very enjoyable movie.For more of my reviews check them out here:iamhannahevans.tumblr.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Red was a fun movie. Stylish and witty with a good mix of humour and action. Sure it's also ridiculous at times but it has its moments, how could it not with a cast this impressive.Bruce Willis is always a good time and I enjoyed his relationship with Mary-Louise Parker, who is very funny here. "Worst first date ever." "I thought you'd have hair." He plays a retired hit man here who, along with his former colleagues try to find out why they've been targeted for death by their former organization.Helen Mirren steals every ass kicking, classy dame, fancy dress wearing scene she's in, absolutely hilarious. And then we also get Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Richard Dryfuss and a very yummy Karl Urban.Some great action scenes, several laughs and while it loses itself a bit along the way I was still satisfied. 7/15/13</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While watching RED I got a sort of classic Men on a Mission vibe from it. I felt like I was watching something like Where Eagles Dare or The Dirty Dozen only it was in modern time and it didn't take itself so seriously. The story includes Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) a retired CIA operative that is forced back into action to stop political corruption when the CIA tries to take him out because he knows to much. Frank get's his old CIA pals Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman) and Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) along with former MI6 Agent Victoria Brown (Helen Mirren) and KGB old enemy Ivan Simanov (Brain Cox) to save the day. If that sounds like fun, you're absolutely right. This is a really fun movie. It has a great old feel to it and if you liked the two movies I listed up at the top then you'll like this.

Old guy meets new girl over the phone and wants to connect up with her.....and ultimately he has to kidnap her to keep her and himself alive. In the meantime they draw in a list of characters to help them find out who is trying to kill them. And well they run into an old Russian assassin who helps them....only to have him reconnected to the love of his life...the woman assassin from MI6...who to show how much she loves him only shoots him three times in the chest...not in the head. In the end, the bad guys and gals are all killed and the First Date turns into something really special....and the old flame is rekindled. The Ultimate Love Story...with lots of guns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent action comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it, RED is nothing more than an excuse for aging actors to come together, shoot stuff up and play tough as nails action heroes. Kind of like Expendables, except intentionally hilarious. And it's that intent to be a comedy that raises this film above Expendables. The idea of old ex-agents going out for a last hurrah is ridiculous enough, but when those agents are played by Willis, Malkovich, Freeman, Mirren and Cox, it just cannot be taken seriously. Sure, you'll buy that these people could have been badasses, but the visual of Helen Mirren shooting a gatling gun is still one of those funniest things I've seen in a while.Luckily the film never takes itself too seriously and most of the film is filled with lampshade hangings, callbacks, parodies and jokes about how old they are. All of the main actors are powerhouse performers, and it shows. They have great chemistry together and obviously enjoy spending time together like this, which is reflected in the quality of their acting.The story is nothing special, truth be told, but for a comedy plot it's not all that bad. It catches your interest, keeps you interested and contains a few honest twists. Could it have been a bit better and more original? Sure, but I have no real complaints about what I ended up getting. You're going to see this film for its humour and actors, not for its story.RED is a definite must watch for all fans of even one of its actors, for fans of action comedies and for everyone who wants to be entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old dudes love this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie with my father-in-law. He's in his 60s and I think this movie spoke to his heart. It's based around the usual action movie clichés about some tough guy agent who's forced out of retirement to kick some butt a final time.The best part of the movie is the casting. Bruce Willis is a bit paint-by-numbers in his usual role, but John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, and Hellen Mirren all play against type and it's fun to see them in a cheesy shoot-em-up movie instead of their usual more "sophisticated" roles. Malkovich steals the show here. He's so good in fact that I almost wish they made a different movie with him as the star. His performance alone is reason enough to watch the movie. The entire film is a bit like Expendables, but I think the RED guys are in on the joke a little more than Stallone and crew, who are still taking themselves too seriously after all these years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the trailers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actively avoided watching this for a while. The trailers gave me the impression this was going to be way too much service to the fans (or perhaps the A-list actors in it). Something like the Expendables only with less action and more eye rolling.I am happy to say I was wrong. This is a solid action lite-spy thriller movie which at no point made me roll my eyes. The action sequences are over the top but at no point they are stupid. Some of them are even more realistic than most other films out there. While the movie is very violent with no fear of covering violent acts (apart from one), at no point it feels the violence is out of place. The story is in its own way believable enough. It bares resemblance to a well know film of the mid 90's but I wont' mention which out of fear I will give away too much. The active is very good, all the technical aspects/parts are very good and in general it feels like a good fun action movie for the fans of the stars in it.If you want to watch a good action movie but don't feel like watching something which requires you to completely turn off the lights in your brain, it's a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action doesn't get old, it just gets smarter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Bruce Willis was entertaining running around in Live Free or Die Hard, you could tell there was a nineteen (Die Hard) or seventeen (Die Hard 2) year gap between his last outing. And RED is the perfect vehicle for this change. Frank Moses is not an old guy trying to be a young man, he's an old, lonely, grouchy guy, who's lived his life in the shadows and is now trying to get some company, when someone starts trying to kill him for something that happened in his past. Given how secretive his work has been, and how nearly everyone he meets ends up dead, Moses has quite a few friends willing to help him figure out what is happening, all of whom not are not only strong actors, but willing to play it for laughs. Malkovich, as an overly paranoid killer, whose paranoia could be justified gets the level of worry just about right for the film, and his banter with Willis makes for a great buddy film. I once saw an SNL skit about Morgan Freeman, were he's bemoaning never being the romantic lead or action hero, always just helping out white guys with their problems. And this film is no different. He's just as watchable as ever, but the idea of him crawling through ventilation ducts or involved in a high speed car chase dies early on. And then there's Helen Mirren, playing a cool as ice MI6 sniper. This is a great role for her, and you half expect to see her take out a room of armed goons while cooking, and then bemoan the fact that she hasn't added enough seasoning. All the characters are very strong, but psychologically unbalanced, so their main hunter - Karl Urban as the ultra professional William Cooper - makes a great foil for the geriatrics. He's a young man who does things by the book, and this youth vs experience makes the cat and mouse chase stand out from other, similar stories. Oh, and Mary-Louise Parker as the love interest dragged from a cubicle into the middle of all the craziness is fun to watch, as her life spirals out of control in the company of all the guns, bombs and car chases, but you'll want to see this film for the four older actors teaching the young ones how it's done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Practically no realism, but what did you expect?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Schwentke's adaptation of the graphic novel miniseries is not a movie that one can take seriously. "Red" makes no pretense about being a silly action flick. Bruce Willis is the star, but John Malkovich's conspiracy theorist is the best character. Helen Mirren is the most surprising cast member; someone who won an Oscar for playing Queen Elizabeth is not the type whom I would expect to co-star in a movie about a former black-ops CIA agent on the run.The movie contains practically no realism: a hit squad machine-guns a house without waking up the neighborhood, and there's a car chase through a conveniently empty street. But let's face it: we shouldn't expect anything realistic in these flicks. This is one movie that knows exactly what kind of a flick it is. It's easy to enjoy if you accept it as something silly.Also starring Mary-Louise Parker, Karl Urban (Éomer in the LOTR movies and Bones in the "Star Trek" reboot), Morgan Freeman, Richard Dreyfuss and Ernest Borgnine. Therefore, "Red" is a combo of people who have worked with Jessica Tandy, Ian McKellen, Clint Eastwood, Steven Spielberg and Frank Sinatra.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedy spy action films are hard to do successfully. Usually the tone is wrong, lots of violent action and not enough comedy or lots of comedy but its unfunny.The film is based on a graphic novel and Bruce Willis plays a retired spy, bored, phoning a clerk every month for missed pension payments before he is forced to spring into action and reunited with his former friends and foes to get to the bottom of what is happening.The friends turn out to be Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich as the paranoid Marvin. Karl Urban is the super CIA agent in pursuit, hampered by these old timers at every turn.Mirren has a hoot of a time as a flower arranging hit woman and its all nicely played along. A good mix of laughs, action and thriller with a dash of romance thrown in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Retired and Extremely Dangerous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Frank Moses" (Bruce Willis) is a former CIA agent who specialized in "wet work". And he was very good at his job. But he is now retired and has developed a crush on a person named "Sarah Ross" (Mary-Louise Parker) who he has never met but helps him with his retirement check over the phone. One day a team of assassins are sent to kill him at his home and after killing all of them he realizes that his phone records might jeopardize Sarah. So he drives to Kansas City and kidnaps her. Along with that he gradually gets in contact with several other people he has worked with in the past to help him out. Naturally, all of them are just like him: Retired and Extremely Dangerous. Anyway, for an action-comedy this film turned out to be pretty good. Both Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker turned in decent performances but it John Malkovich (as "Marvin Boggs") who really stole the show as the paranoid agent who was subjected to LSD for 11 years. He was simply hilarious. That said, I liked this movie and I recommend it for those who enjoy films of this nature.</fullReview>

His only joy comes from calling his pension call center rep Sarah Ross (Mary-Louis Parker). He actually ask her out, but then a team of expert soldiers comes to kill him.The best part of the movie is Parker's indignant response to Bruce Willis kidnapping her. She's the best part of the movie. It's the part of the movie that they need to keep at its center.Bruce Willis is playing the cool detached persona. It doesn't make for an energetic character. It's cool to see for awhile especially when he's teamed up with Parker. But her character's role diminishes as more old timers get rounded up.The action is over the top as expected. Other than who however, there isn't much to distinguish this cartoon action from all the other cartoon action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Cast Makes the Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red (2010) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Lightweight but entertaining action picture about a retired agent (Bruce Willis) who has a hit put out on him and the woman (Mary-Louise Parker) he loves so he reaches out to some old partners (Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich) to help him. RED isn't going to win any major awards and it's certainly not going to go down as one of the best action pictures out there but it still has enough charm and a terrific cast that makes it worth watching. It's almost hard to believe but there are actually four Oscar-winning actors on display here. There's Freeman but we've also got Richard Dreyfuss, Helen Mirren and Ernest Borgnine in a small role. The wonderful cast is certainly the biggest reason to check this out as all of them are quite good in their roles and appears to be having fun. This is especially true for Parker who clearly steals the film as the somewhat dimwitted regular gal who finds herself mixed up in this conspiracy where one body is falling at all times. Malkovich plays that eccentric weirdo like only he can and Freeman is also good and that's no different here. Willis is pretty much just playing another version of himself but it's still fun. The action scenes are quite creative in their own way and I really liked the visual style brought to the screen by director Robert Schwentke. He manages to never take the subject too serious and instead he keeps everything moving at a nice pace with the charm factor high. Again, RED isn't any sort of masterpiece but if you enjoy any of the cast members then you should have a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't really heard of this film, perhaps I just missed any hype or promotions for it. However, what a treat! A terrific cast with an interesting plot and fantastic action! It was fun to see Bruce Willis doing what Bruce Willis does best in action movies, but also a fun surprise to see Morgan Freeman in a different role for him. I see that a sequel is being released and I hope that it captures the fun and spirit of the first film. I enjoyed every moment of the film and it was very well paced and edited. There were enough surprising turns to keep me guessing and cheering for the protagonist all the way to the end. One of the best action films I have seen in a long time that wasn't totally predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Movie Snubbed By the Academy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with, anything Bruce Willis does (unless mushy-mushy-kiss-kiss garbage) is, without question, Academy Award worthy. He is an actor who is only matched (and definitely not surpassed) by Mr. Sylvester Stallone, Mr. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mr. Wesley Snipes, Sir and Lord Chuck Norris, Mr. Jason Stathom, Nicolas Cage and maybe one or two others. If only they would do a movie together. And I do know there are plenty of those out there who may disagree with me?and I do truly care about your opinion?really. Well ? not really. To put it bluntly ? I absolutely don't care what you think. I feel this is yet another example of a fantastic cinema-graphic phenomenon overlooked by a clearly ostentatious academy. What a bunch of snobs. Were there problems with this movie ? sure there were a few?a very, very few. When you have a group emblematically known as Retired-Extremely-Dangerous (RED), you are almost certain to experience some issues and there might be a couple of hard-to-take scenes ? that is heavy drama (oh so heavy drama.) One scene in particular that almost wrenched lamenting moisture from these normally arid tear ducts was the sad killing off of Morgan Freeman ? what a tragic bummer. If only Mr. Willis was closer ? he may have saved him ? and if Chuck Norris was in the movie - he would have simply willed Mr. Freeman survival. At least Mr. Willis wasn't left out in the cold. He had some pretty awesome support still alive, breathing and kicking butt. Mix Mary-Louise Parker and automatic weapons ? you have a symphony of lead. John Malkovich and sanity ? well ? that just ain't happening. Rebecca Pidgeon she is a badass in training ? give her time ? she has great potential. All in all, they did a fine job covering for the hole left by Morgan's sad departure. All seriousness aside?likable characters and a fast paced plot made for an enjoyable movie. No moral mirrors to ponder or political drums to bang ? just action. This was a very easy movie to watch and appreciate, and I prefer movies that provide escape and not some stupid dia-tripe. Thanks old folks ? and bring back Morgan ? you know you want to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Bruce Willis flick, entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'R.E.D.' - 'Retired, extremely dangerous.' That is the code word for Bruce Willis as Frank Moses, perhaps the best 'black ops' agent that every worked. Alone in his retirement, he fights boredom by calling the administrative agency, and talks to Mary-Louise Parker as Sarah Ross, he claims the monthly check hasn't arrived so she has to send him a replacement. Then he tears up the check in his hand. He finds her nice to talk to even though they never met.The action starts one early morning hour when Frank gets up for a drink of water, while a group of armed men are in his house. He first pretends to be half asleep but circles around and gets the best of all of them. Realizing someone wants him dead, he goes on the run.He ends up first in Kansas City, where Sarah lives, and he is in her home as she returns from work. He basically kidnaps her, but for her own good, those who want him dead also are after Sarah because of their phone conversations, she may know something.At one point my wife turned to me and said, "This movie is really well made." And it is, very interesting and entertaining. Frank eventually joins up with other former members of his black ops team, Helen Mirren as Victoria Morgan Freeman as Joe Matheson, and the kookie character played by John Malkovich, to figure out what is going on. Sarah, fresh from her boring desk job, finds all this action fascinating and is thoroughly enjoying the situations she finds herself in.Rebecca Pidgeon, rarely seen outside David Mamet movies, here is Cynthia Wilkes, working for the government, and her agent searching for Frank is Karl Urban as William Cooper.SPOILERS: In a 'situation' from the 1980s, a man who now is US Vice President, and soon to run for POTUS, had killed a bunch of people, and now he wanted to make sure none of the others there were alive so no one could talk. The list was being killed off, and Frank was one of them. It was up to him and his group to de-fuse that situation and bring out the truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you put together a veteran and talented cast of actors including the likes of Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Richard Dreyfuss and even Ernest Borgnine and then add into the mix some talented younger actors such as Mary Louise Parker and Karl Urban, you know that you're not going to be disappointed - and "Red" does not disappoint. It's not the greatest movie ever made, but it's a fun and action packed movie that sometimes makes you laugh.Willis plays Frank Moses, a retired CIA agent who suddenly finds himself being hunted down by the agency he used to work for. Lonely, bored and smitten with Sarah (Parker) - who works at the pensions office for former government employees and whom he would call repeatedly just to talk to her - he eventually drags her and several ex-colleagues into the work of figuring out why the government wants him dead, which leads eventually up to the highest echelons of the U.S. Government and a cover up of war crimes committed many years before. This features all of the standard action scenes that you'd expect to find in such a movie, always mixed with a relatively low-key but fun story and good performances from the two primary leads - the ice-cold but amusing Willis and the baffled and very cute Parker.It's good fun and nothing too serious and represents a great vehicle for the veteran actors named.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All you do, is worth doing in style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are going to do something, you might as well do it in style. That seem to be the motto of both the director and characters of Red. Red is a slow paced action movie, laced with a subtle humor that many times is much better than the obvious kind. Retired CIA hit man Frank Moses suddenly finds himself the target of a hit squad. Now, he intends to survive, and he is the best at his work. But he is no special rush, nothing is worth doing if you can't do it in style. To aid him he recruits his old friends Joe and Marvin, and brings along a girl he is fond of. Together they form a unstoppable force, heading straight for the CIA top.This is an unusual action movie, just in my taste. As tasted it is slow paced, almost subtle but full of great special effects and extravagant explosions. Just a great mix and balance of low and high key, that augments each part. The story is pretty basic, a typical action story, but the editing and direction elevates the story to another level. Schwentke's direction is masterful, I guess he is at least partly responsible for the tone of the movie, but also the play with scenes, settings and visual effects are impressive.Just as impressive is the cast. The character Frank Moses is just perfect for Willis, and when he is supported by such a stellar cast with Freeman, Malkovich, Mirren, Cox, Urban and Parker you could turn just about anything into a decent movie. But with a good story and directing Red turns into one of the better action comedies in recent years.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flashy, Fun &amp; Shallow; RED Proves Age Doesn't Hurt Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as Stallone did with THE EXPENDABLES, Bruce Willis proves he's not too old for action in RED. It seems 2010 was the year for off-the-wall action films, and while RED wasn't the best (that would be THE A-TEAM in my opinion), it definitely wasn't the worst. It's based on comic mini-series from Homage Comics, though pretty loosely from what I understand. I've never read the series so I couldn't tell you, but I enjoyed the film adaptation from director Robert Schwentke. The film centers on retired CIA agent Frank Moses (Willis) as he discovers the agency has marked him for termination. He snatches up Sarah Ross (Parker), his pension fund handler on whom he's got a crush, and hightails it out to find his old team members. With the CIA on his trail and a conspiracy unraveling from his past, Moses recruits some of his fellow retirees: Joe (Freeman) has cancer and is spending his final days in a retirement home, Marvin (Malkovich) lives in the swamps of Florida hiding from government satellites, and Victoria (Mirren) runs a bed and breakfast while taking the occasional contract on the side.The movie's not bad, but it's nothing to get excited about. It's got some great action sequences, but the film falls into the same trap as many other modern action films. The characters never seem as if they're in any real danger, treating even the tightest of situations as a total joke and smirking their way through trouble. The film tries to jerk us back to reality for a moment halfway through the film with an unexpected death but it doesn't take long to jump back into the next action sequence. It's a flashy, fun, and completely shallow. The film comes off as more of a comedy than an action film, with plenty of jokes about the aging characters going toe-to-toe with their younger adversaries. My favorite scene in the whole film has Bruce Willis in a brutal fight with Karl Urban (as the CIA agent in charge of bringing Moses in) to the sounds of Aerosmith's "Back in the Saddle". It's the only fight that seems to have any weight behind as it appears the two are beating the crap out of each other. The rest of the fights are loud and devoid of suspense, but fun enough.It's a shame the film isn't better because it looks like everyone involved is having a blast with it all. Willis hams it in and passes through every scene with a wry smile on his face, and Mirren seemed to enjoy the chance to join in on the mayhem (I'm sure she doesn't get too many offers for blowout roles like these at this point). Malkovich does crazy better than just about anyone, so he's perfect for the role of an ex-CIA agent who's mind has been warped from repeated secret LSD testing. The coolest part of the film is Brian Cox as a KGB agent who's passed his prime and longs for the good ol' days of the Cold War, and Karl Urban reminds us he has the potential to be one of the coolest modern action stars (I always thought he was pretty good in DOOM). All of this, and Richard Dreyfus in a supporting role, and the film still never rises past the point of eye candy. I loved watching it, but nothing about it stuck with me afterwards. There's always the chance for a sequel, and if RED is given another chance I hope the filmmakers will try to rise above forgettable action romp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining mixture of genres with a bunch of great actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The big names of Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and the highly memorable and convincing John Malkovich unite in this quite diversified movie that has a strong humorous and human touch but soon turns out to be also a tension loaded conspiracy thriller with good special effects and action scenes. This mixture strangely fits very well together and gives this movie a more unique touch as it is neither a simple conspiracy action thriller nor a dumb parody. The main characters have all something crazy and unique about them and I especially adored John Malkovich in this flick that easily beats the concurrence.The story is rapidly told. Bruce Willis plays an ex-agent for the CIA that has become old and dreams of a life in tranquillity with a beautiful woman by his side that he seems to have met at the telephone. But as life is life, his past is still haunting him and for an unknown reason the organization he worked for is chasing him and his old partners now and he has to live on the run to save his future love of his life and find out the reasons beyond this conspiracy as he reactivates his old partners in crime for a new mission.Even though the story is in the end quite predictable and not very original at all and even though the main actors have all done a lot more interesting movies in the past, this flick is highly entertaining from the beginning to the end and worth to be watched once even if I would not consider a purchase of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film brings nothing new to the genre (old codgers show they still got spunk, like the last thirty years of the life of almost-eternal George Burns in art and in life). I don't however agree with some of the extremely negative reviews. Yes, it may be hard to see great actors like Mirren and Freeman hamming it up, but what the hell, they looked like they were having fun, and we all know that good roles aren't that easy for ageing stars ? Mirren can hardly redo Elizabeth, can she? Sure, the thing is full of clichés, and there are several improbable segues. But we're all supposed to be grown ups by now, having seen a gadzillion Bourne type flicks, so we know that all spies keep hidey-holes full of weapons, passports and money, so we shouldn't gripe that it's not explained in the film. Just take it as a given for the genre, sit back and enjoy the decent pacing, minimalist script (for once!), sympathetic actors (Mary Louise Parker is a major scene-stealer), and great casting for the secondary parts (Brian Cox as a shady Russian, Richard Dreyfus as an arms dealer who's channelling Dick Cheney, Rebecca Pidgeon as a CIA boss dragon lady). It's a Bruce Willis action slash comedy slash rom-com, for heaven's sake. Judged on its own terms, it's decent, well crafted, and I certainly didn't feel my time was wasted. Casablanca also started its mythic journey as a well-made B film. This one won't age as well, of course, since comedies especially topical comedies never do, but for now its nice to see good actors having fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot of RED (not to be confused with Warren Beatty's epic "Reds") is not intended to be believable. The plot is only a vehicle for showcasing the talents of a group of truly excellent actors in a comedy. It is very very funny. A lot of really good lines and comic repartee. I am reminded of the exchange in "Crocodile Dundee" when a punk attempts to rob Crocodile with a switchblade, and Dundee says, "You call that a knife? This is a knife," while pulling his large Bowie knife from his boot.Of the star-studded cast, some are reprising character types they've used before. Bruce Willis is the lovable bald tough guy. Mary-Louise Parker uses the same character traits she uses in Showtime's "Weeds" series. Morgan Freeman plays his cameo role as the same Morgan Freeman character we've become familiar with. I'm not saying they aren't good or that they are limited to those portrayals (Willis, for instance, plays a different character when he wears his hairpiece), just that the roles are no stretch for them.There are a number of American actors, such as Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman, who are known for an uncanny ability to transform themselves into the character they are playing. Dame Helen Mirren also has a repertoire of diverse roles, from Britain's current Queen Elizabeth to Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison. I don't think she ever played a comic assassin before, but again, it didn't seem a stretch. Again, not a criticism -- she is delightful in the part.Richard Dreyfuss is another actor who has a very diverse repertoire. (I don't understand why he was listed as far down in the credit order as he was, even though he has relatively little screen time.) In RED, he convincingly plays a mean and vicious villain.But it is the very versatile John Malkovich who steals this show! He plays paranoid retired agent Marvin Boggs. Sarah Ross (Parker) says of Boggs, "Wow. This guy's insane." Frank Moses (Willis) replies, "Well, he thought he was the subject of a secret government mind control project. As it turns out, he really was being given daily doses of LSD for 11 years." Ross (Parker) then says, "Well in that case, he looks great. Yeah." Malkovich perfectly portrays a character that fits that description. That's why I summarized my review as I did (taking it from that scene in the sci-fi film "Being John Malkovich" where Malkovich causes what scientists call a "singularity.")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I attend the opening weekend release of Red based on the graphic novel of the same name , rated pg 13 not meant for the kiddies This movie stars Bruce Willis a retired CIA who is bored with his hum drum life as retiree of the CIA.The team includes Joe Matheson(Morgan Freeman),Marvin Boggs(John Malkovich), Victoria (Helen Mirren) and Ivan (Brian Cox).Bruce wills looks at home it this action comedy plays a retired CIA black ops agent (know as RED retired extremely dangerous). He is bored with his hum drum life,regularly rips up his monthly checks just so he can call the CIA pension office just to talk with the person in charge of his plan... played very well by Mary- Louis parker. He is set up for assignation from the higher ups in the CIA for what he knows about and old job assignment and his crew of ARRP assassin's were involved in back in the 80's.(I thought the CIA was supposed to be the good guys what gives here). He is hunted down by the CIA agent William cooper (Played very well by Karl urban) who is assigned by the higher ups to hunt down Bruce Willis and his pals. They come across a conspiracy theory involving VP of the United States, and Alexander Dunning (played by Richard Dreyfuss pulled of the villain role very well as nasty arms dealer).Throughout the movie Bruce Willis and his band of aarp hit men travels across county to put clues together to find out why they want them dead. It a very well written movie and, the cast looks like they are having a lot of fun just acting like kids shootouts, kicking butt. They do a very good job with the traveling scenes. They don't keep it confined to one area. They travel across country and utilize various locations to add to the fun of the movie... I especially love john malkovich's as Marvin Boggs a crazy as a fox agent. John steals some scenes in the move that are just too funny to describe here. I like how they use post cards on the screen to tell the audience where they are heading. I thought it was a fun movie, good casting. The best thing you can take from it a fun afternoon at the movies well worth your trip and 2 hrs out of your day. Plus age is just a number if you want to have fun.I give it 3 stars.My Link is http://thehollywoodreview.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Interesting and believable plot and good acting, especially by John Malkovich, who is simply hilarious and comes close to stealing the show. What a smooth actor he is--I hope he takes an award for this movie. Morgan Freeman is terrific too, though he doesn't look close to the 80-year-old he is said to be in this part. Bruce Willis is better than usual. His portrayal of emotion is much like the description Dorothy Parker gave to Katherine Hepburn years ago, it "runs the gamut from A to B." This movie is a fun way to spend an evening. I watched it twice in 24 hours, to see what I missed the first time around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Moses (Willis) is a retired CIA agent who needs to know why the CIA is trying to kill him and his former team.RED: Retired Extremely Dangerous. Got it? That applies to Frank.This is a comfortable thriller. Everything happens and goes wrong, but no matter, Frank is here and he's got everything under control. The movie is almost dreamlike in that everything is done in a somewhat subtle, but efficient way. Kind of seamless if you will. No one panics, no one overacts although Marvin (Malkovich) does give that a go from time to time, but Frank is there to restrain him. And, from time to time we do hear some good, almost LOL lines. Mary-Louise Parker's character, Sarah, plays Frank's love interest perfectly and one could very easily fall in love with her from the get-go. Morgan Freeman (Joe), Helen Mirren (Victoria), Richard Dryfuss (Alexander), Brian Cox (Ivan) and Rebecca Pidgeon (Cynthia) were all a joy to watch. Ernest Borgnine (Henry) - yeah, I thought so too, but there he was big as life - just gets better with age. But, it is Karl Urban (Cooper) who really steals the show. If they ever do a real life ARCHER (cartoon character kind of a James Bond), Mr. Urban would be my choice. He's perfect for that role. He is so good, you almost want him to catch Frank and his team. Come to think of it, he could also successfully play the new Superman. Think about it. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only one F-bomb by Karl Urban near the end. Otherwise none.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RED - Retired and Extremely Dangerous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Old man, my ass."Red is the action romp that recent movies like The Losers &nbsp;and Knight &amp; Day have tried, and mostly failed, to be. It's fun without being dumb, funny, not too long or short, action- packed, and has a great cast as a bonus.The story is about a retired C.I.A. field operative (Willis) who is seemingly targeted by his own agency for death, for some unknown reason. He goes on the run with his recent acquaintance/love interest (Mary-Louise Parker) and looks up a bunch of his similarly retired buddies to help him find out what's going on.&nbsp;And it's that cast of supporting characters that really makes Red worthwhile. It includes Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Brian Cox, and they all seemed to be having a ball as action stars. &nbsp;Karl Urban also pitches in as the primary agent in the hunt for our dangerous oldsters. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better cast than that in ANY movie, regardless of genre.&nbsp;My one real problem with Red was the story. The best that could be said about it was that it was there, and it gave an excuse for the gang to get together and hop all around the U.S. Action movies admittedly don't need spectacular plots, but that of Red often left me cold.Other than that, I give Red a full recommendation. The casting was inspired, and it's just undeniably entertaining to see these guys (especially Mirren and Malkovich) blowing people away and just generally proving that bad-asses come in all ages.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ripping Good Entertainment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RED (aka Retired Extremely Dangerous) is the moniker assigned to four retired CIA operatives, and if ever there were a film that demonstrates that folks beyond retirement age are still impressively functional, this is it. The story is adapted from the graphic novel by Cully Hamner and Warren Ellis by screenwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber and directed with great style by Robert Schwentke. But has been said often, it is the brilliant cast of experienced actors that makes this film one to treasure as simply splendid entertainment. Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is bored in his retirement; his only point of interest is a recurrent telephone conversation regarding his pension check with an equally bored government worker Sarah Ross (Mary-Louis Parker in a role that finally gives the range of her comedic talent its due!). Their conversations are overheard by the CIA - William Cooper (Karl Urban) and his boss Cynthia Wilkes (Rebecca Pidgeon) - and Frank is marked for assassination. Bu told frank is wily and outsmarts and out shoots his intruders, escapes to take Sarah away from her boring desk job and a caper begins. It seems there is a plot to uncover the USA Vice President's involvement in a Guatemala coups and Frank seeks out his old confreres - Joe (Morgan Freeman, living in a nursing home but very alert and involved with CIA thinking patterns), Marvin (John Malkovich, a half crazy near delusional but very fine marksman living in an underground hideaway), and Victoria (Helen Mirren, living the elegant life of teas and social activities while privately still taking contract jobs to knock off bad people). At first Sarah is perplexed by the 'abduction' on the part of Frank, but soon becomes an involved participant in the drive to expose the secret of the Vice President. The group engages a retired Russian spy (Brian Cox) who just happens to be Victoria's old boyfriend, and together these REDs use their skills, and brains, and great humor to achieve their goal. It is the old REDs against the young CIA agents that provides the tug of war that makes the film soar. The cast sparkles in this richly colorful movie brimming over with CGI effects and impossible situations. This is not a deep film but a movie that will entertain form the first frame to the final rather surprising episode. It is a pleasure to simply watch the talents of Willis/Mirren/Freeman/Malkovich/Parker/Cox interact like so many pieces of a fine Swiss watch: they obviously love what they are asked to do!

I felt like they began to develop his character but just when you thought he was going to have more to do, he didn't...After watching a few recent DVD releases lately that really made you think to follow the plot (Inception and the A Team), it was nice to view something that was just plain fun....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Pitch: C.I.A. vs. O.A.P.s.The Review: There's been a trend over the last twenty years or so of action movie stars getting increasingly elderly. Maybe it's our ever increasing fondness for nostalgia, or perhaps the novelty of seeing old fogies with big guns appeals as much in theory as the opposite, extremely young end of the scale that Hit Girl and her friends occupy. But for whatever reason, action stars have kept making movies as they get older, and indeed movies are now taking this a step further and making action stars out of the bus pass generation.Based on a Warren Ellis comic book, RED has compiled a cast list with varying familiarity with the action genre. Bruce Willis has the most extensive action CV, and although into his fifties is still deemed sufficiently cool to be leading man material. John Malkovich and Morgan Freeman both have history in this genre, but in both cases it's less auspicious in the relative terms of their previous works. Crucially, while all of them can normally be relied on to deliver good work, none of them is a reliable mark of quality when it comes to bullets and explosions. They are all at least serviceable here, although Willis especially is little more than that.But they are just the tip of an iceberg that's made of acting quality so solid it would put a hole in your average battleship. Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfuss and even Ernest Borgnine, who was retired before I was in short trousers, all pop up, often far too briefly. Getting more screen time are Mary Louise Parker as Bruce's love interest, wandering through wide-eyed and screaming, and a rather stoic Karl Urban as the man sent to track down and round up this bunch of geriatric gunslingers. The biggest stunt of the casting is Helen Mirren, who gets a very big gun and smiles sweetly as she twists most of the male cast around her little finger.So what do you make out of a comic book and a bunch of willing actors of generally advancing years? Director Robert Schwentke, whose previous form peaked with the Jodie Foster snoozefest Flightplan, manages to make a serviceable and lightly enjoyable action movie, with the odd entertaining set piece and a few mildly smirk-worthy lines, but it never really gets into top gear. It is worth saying, though, that the action is at least clean and generally well handled, and avoids the camera fitting and shaking so prevalent in today's action movies. It will take up an hour and a half of your time divertingly enough, but that's also about how long it will last in your memory ? and, given the age of the cast, it's probably about how long it lasted in theirs as well.Why see it at the cinema: Some solid, well handled action, a few decent laughs and an absolutely killer last scene which mixes both will all get benefit from a large screen and some company.The Score: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good flick. I say watch it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't help but compare "RED" to the Coen Brothers' "Burn After Reading". Both are comedies centered around preposterous CIA plots, and both feature John Malkovich. For "Retired, Extremely Dangerous" I only lament that the script spent more time setting up a ridiculous plot than giving its' A-List cast dialogue worthy of 3 Oscars (Morgan Freeman,Helen Mirren and Richard Dreyfuss) and 2 Emmies (Brian Cox and Malkovich). Mary-Louise Parker gives one of the best performances in the film as a government clerk who gets dragged into the life and death spy game only because Bruce Willis' retired character takes a shine to her. Karl Urban gets the thankless role as the CIA henchman leading the black ops team trying to exterminate Willis and company.The plot is entirely too ridiculous to be taken seriously, but the film is also a little flat taken strictly as a comedy. I'll split it down the middle and say it's worth watching if it comes up while you're on a plane, or a rental on a "we're bored" night, if only to watch these excellent actors look like they're having a quite good time.</fullReview>

Willis has rarely been better. Malkovich, Cox and Mirren show their comic sides with nuance and humor. Most surprising of all is Parker whose self-assured comic timing and warmth enhances the rugged cynicism of the retired CIA agents. Expertly edited, sharply directed, with a tight script, "Red" has nary a scene or word wasted. Of course, it's all make believe and almost cartoonish but that's what makes this film a delight. Add to this cake of delights a tasteful score with appropriate musical tracks so rarely used in the correct way any longer in modern cinema.This is a fine popcorn movie that won't change you but will entertain and bring a smile to your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red &amp; Knight &amp; Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red and Knight &amp; Day I decided to review these two films on my facebook reviews together as they are in some ways comparable.In the first, Knight &amp; Day, Cameron Diaz, Day, is returning home for her sisters wedding when she stumbles upon Tom Cruise, Knight, a CIA agent who having been set up as a patsy is forced to go undercover and on the run. Through a set of unbelievable circumstances the two embark on a farcical roller-coaster ride of espionage and death defying feats.In Red, Bruce Willis is a retired CIA agent who having pressed the wrong switches upset someone lurking in the shadows. Forced out of hiding he joins up with fellow CIA retirees John Malkovitz, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren. Together they too embark on a farcical roller-coaster ride of espionage and death defying feats.This however is where the two films part company.When Cruise and Diaz appeared on Top Gear, (UK) Jeremy Clarkson said of the two Hollywood actors "this is where humans will be in 100 years when evolution has reached perfection". Sadly I disagree. What comes out from this film that you do not have in Red is that very Hollywood obsession with appearance. The need to have endless cosmetic surgery, reconstructive dental work and lifts in your shoes. Peel away the make up, remove the implants and fake faces and what you have is very normal looking people. This is relevant to the cause as Knight &amp; Day seems lost where as Red knows its own identity. Action packed and full of CGI and exploding things, stunts and gun battles both films are fun to behold. Cruise leaps from moving vehicles and hand to hand combat with sharks, it is the consummate Tom Cruise film, but in the same breath it's not an action film. It has the underlying feeling that it's a comedy action. A problem arises however, because it's not funny. The key element in comedy is humour and in Knight &amp; Day there is at no point a moment when you laugh. It is then simply a film of no substance, same old same old, which rides on the back of America's, and now the world's, obsession with 'beautiful people looking beautiful'. The problem with beautiful people sitting around looking beautiful is that nothing ever gets done. God made most people either ugly or normal looking so we could do things slightly more important than walk up and down a catwalk. And this brings us to Red.In Red, the lead characters are all old, wrinkled and gray. There's not cosmetically enhanced beautiful people leaping from rooftops but normal people undertaking equally improbable things as in Knight &amp; Day with the exception that they can all act far better than Cruise or Diaz. There is as much action packed exploding CGI things and despite their age none of the cast look out of place or struggle to be convincing. Red mercifully never takes itself too serious but with tongue in cheek catapults the ridiculous characters into the impossible with full vigour and there is more humour to boot.I enjoyed both films, both are best described as 'cerebrally relaxing' and would give them each 7/10 for entertainment value, the downside is that one ends with the overwhelming feeling that a sequel will be following along behind and it's not actually the one you want to see more of.Red is Good Fun 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis is back to the charmer that characterized his early career, and he is joined in this action-filled spy spoof by Helen Mirren (of all people), Ernest Borgnne (who is surely dead), Morgan Feeeman, John Malkovitch, Mary Louise Parker and assorted other actors and actresses. The plot isn't worth summarizing because it is ridiculous, and it's easy to understand why the CIA refused to cooperate --- although, to be fair, it did not arrange for the director, the screenwriter, or any of the actors to be assassinated, which might have been a natural response. It's as filled with weaponry and killing as any video game, and it has about as much redeeming social value. But it makes Bruce Williis seem worth watching again and it is a hoot to watch Helen Mirren as a cultured assassin foiling a CIA plot in service of the worst of the bad-guys played by Richard Dreyfuss, another casting against type. Check your logical faculties at the door and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to watch Red with my brother in the cinema, and for some reason the screen room wasn't very packed. So straight away I assumed that it wouldn't be that good. But within 15 minutes of the movie, I was totally enticed. The acting from Bruce Willis is so spot on, he plays his character well and I found that some of the situations he finds himself in, very entertaining, and just simply funny, in some situations in the film, some lines made by the characters imply that there will be a twist to the plot so you sort of loose some of that anticipation you had before. Morgan Freeman is excellent, his attitude is brilliant, his handiness and on-screen humour and companionship with John Malkovich is brilliant, the on-screen romance between Hellen Mirren and Brian Cox is priceless and you hope, some where in the midst of the story, that they patch things up! The action sequences in the film are brilliant, they move and act just how you'd expect older ex-government agents to be but still retain that professional edge to their work, which makes it even more awesome.One thing I took issue with is that there's always a love interest in these genres of film involving Bruce Willis and it's always someone younger and pretty who doesn't believe his story but eventually believes him and also some how miraculously professional-like, just like the characters.Karl Urban is brilliant as a young "hitman" trying to prove himself to the FBI and also as some sort of a family man, but in some scenes his portrayal of a concerned husband and father is just to dry and forced from him. But that is looked over because of the following awesome scenes.The last half an hour to 45 minutes of the film become quite predictable, with a few small twists, but unoriginal twists.Despite this, I still think it's a brilliant film that shows even the most ageing actors have still got it, and will probably always have it! I would recommend this to anyone! :)</fullReview>

Anyways, it was really good! Who said that old CIA agents can't still kick butt! Bruce Willis is magnificent and funny in his role as a "retired" CIA agent who gets sucked into another mission. It's out of theaters now?so look out for it at the nearest movie store or on Netflix, because if you like action, and you like a good comedy?you LOVE this movie just as much as I did!

Austin Powers did it so irreverently, and if you didn't like that, you should like the more dignified comedic venture found here. This is a new favorite for me in the venue of action/comedy. The comedic tone is perfect. It does not draw away from the action, nor does it overshadow the story.Production style is smooth with a tongue-in-cheek look at the Cold War days, a paranoid view of the American government, and a hopeful view of the future. I did not know what to expect, so I had no preconceived notions surrounding this film, so my cold reaction is that it was totally enjoyable, and one I WILL own.This work features little character development, but it doesn't seem to need it. Investment in the characters is still easy and natural. The plot moves well, and the execution flows consistently to a satisfactory conclusion.All in all? Watch it.

		<fullReview>An action comedy, starring Bruce Willis in self-referential (and slightly self-spoofing) mode? Yeah, Cop Out wasn't that great. Fortunately, Red is a stronger piece of material for two reasons: first of all, it's based on a really good comic-book by genre maestro Warren Ellis; secondly, Willis isn't paired with Tracy Morgan, but a talented ensemble including Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren.The former John McClane plays Frank Moses, a retired man who spends his days sitting around the house, reading trashy romance novels and talking on the phone with an attractive woman (Mary-Louise Parker) working for the pension office. After a failed hit on his life, Frank - who is revealed to be a former CIA operative - discovers he's been labeled RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous) and decides to get to the bottom of the story with the help of a few ex-colleagues (Freeman, Malkovich, Mirren) and former enemies (Brian Cox), while a young, ambitious agent (Karl Urban) is on his trail.With the comedy/action balance firmly in place and the "old people" angle (minor roles are played by veterans like Richard Dreyfuss and Ernest Borgnine) being a big part of the film's appeal, it could be easy to mistake it for an Expendables rip-off (Willis being in both movies is another element to consider). However, Red is a different beast: the tone is less tongue-in-cheek (there's no equivalent of the Stallone/Schwarzenegger encounter), and, with the exception of Willis, none of the actors have a reputation as actions stars, though they've all had experience in the genre, including Mirren (she previously played an assassin in Shadowboxer). As such, the film is a fun piece of entertainment that takes itself seriously enough to not become ridiculous, but is allowed to play with genre conventions.Almost inevitably, the plot is on the thinner side of things, primarily because the original comic is only used as the basis of the first five minutes. After that, it's up to the screenwriters to come up with a worthy follow-up plot: intriguing, but hardly more unpredictable than the average action movie. That it stays believable and enjoyable is, obviously, due to the cast: everyone appears to be enjoying themselves, particularly Malkovich who has another go at his more manic turns (see Burn After Reading), and the younger players - Parker, Urban, Julian McMahon - are up to the challenge. As for Willis, his solid and entertaining lead role ensures Cop Out is nothing more than a distant memory.Red may not be the best comic-book adaptation of 2010 (hello, Kick-Ass and Scott Pilgrim), but it's got the humor and energy to provide a nice couple of hours at the movies, plus characters that would be fun to watch again. A Malkovich-centric spin-off, perhaps?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're like me and have parents that think all movies these days are nothing but special affects and corny jokes, than this movie is a winner. The comedy and action in this film keep coming throughout and make you want to skip the restroom and hold it until it's over. The cast is nearly unbeatable with names like Freeman, Willis, Mirren, and Malkovich. It presents a unique opportunity to take the parents out to a movie that everyone will enjoy. One of best aspects of this film is that it gives the younger generation an chance to see great actors doing great action as opposed to today's modern trend of canned laughter and "pretty boy" tough guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really hope that more films like Red will be made in the following years. I knew I had to see this after I checked the payroll.Red laughs at action films right in the face. Bruce Willis laughs at himself a few time. To be honest, so does the rest of the cast.It's a simple story in which all the characters are described by the first scene they appear in and it's so damn enjoyable to watch. You don't expect the movie to be anything more than fun. The plot is plain simple, but the way it's executed gives it air to breathe.A few more twists would be nice, a bit more of Malkovich too. But I don't regard these issues as flaws. The would have only contributed to the overall movie reception, not it's essence.The cast, the obvious winks, the effects (with really big winks) and the lightness of the whole picture (you expect fun and it delivers) makes Red a film worth watching. Maybe not buying a DVD, but surely renting it for a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Retired life is not agreeing with Frank(Willis). He tries to get in contact with a sweet young woman(Parker), but other than that, not much happens. Then one day, he's attacked. Oh, it's fine. He's ex-CIA. Did I not mention that? Someone has put a hit on him, and he's gonna find out who. With the help of some old friends. This has two main draws. It's an adaptation of a beloved Warren Ellis mini(which I have not read it). While I can't comment on how it treats its source material, the stylization(appropriate in amount(this isn't like Sin City or 300... it's closer to something by John Woo), with effective use of slow-motion) of the cool action(though it isn't terribly tense, our heroes take care of the opposition with ease), much of the camera-work(with extended pans, simulating comic book panels) and the tongue-in-cheek tone really fit the medium this was "translated" from. The other thing is the cast. Bruce being a bad-ass is always a positive. Mirren with guns and in this role is fun. Freeman is surprisingly little in this. Mary-Louise isn't bad. Dreyfuss is definitely good. Malkovich is enjoyable as a raving loon, if it is quite forced at times. Cox is downright goofy, chewing almost as much scenery as a Russian as Curry did in Congo. And that's one of the unfortunate things. Only about half the humor works. The rest just falls flat. Because of how over the top it is(and at times, it is maybe too silly), this doesn't fare well when it tries to be serious... it utterly fails to balance the two, and when we're meant to care, we simply don't. This would be fine if we weren't supposed to... however, we are, here and there. The dialog is often dry(and that doesn't refer to wit) as sandpaper. I honestly have a hard time believing that some of this stuff made it past early drafts. The talents do what they can, usually failing to save it, and we have to suffer through rather poor delivery every now and then in this. There are things in this that you kind of expect, and yet they still "work". On the whole, it certainly is entertaining, if there is little sense of danger(it does manage to be exciting some of the time). The plot is pretty straightforward, and winds up not really sticking with you. Almost nothing surprises you as far as developments go, and impact of them is nonexistent. There is a bit of mild to moderate violence and brief strong language in this. I recommend it to those looking for something light that the concept appeals to. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RED stands for Retired Extremely Dangerous. Retired CIA operative Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is so bored in retirement that he tears up his pension cheques just so that he has a reason to telephone pension clerk Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker). He is therefore a little put out when she reacts to his unheralded arrival in her apartment by screaming and objecting to a) being kidnapped and b) his lack of hair. To be fair, his reason for abducting her is because she is in danger from the same people who have destroyed his house while failing to assassinate him. What follows involves Moses recruiting fellow wrinklies Joe (Morgan Freeman), Marvin (John Malkovich) and Victoria (Helen Mirren) to find out what is going on, while Sarah (who, we already know, has a yearning for travel and adventure) gradually starts to enjoy the excitement.This movie is a romp, and makes no pretense to be anything else. All the cast appear to be having the time of their lives, and Parker makes a much better fist of it as the everywoman sucked into action/adventure hi-jinks than Katherine Heigl and Cameron Diaz managed earlier in the year. Malkovich, in lowbrow mode, is very funny as someone who is excessively squirrelly due to having been force fed far too much LSD.RED is based on a comic written by Warren Ellis and, like Ellis' comic work, it remembers that it is supposed to be fun. It isn't deep, it isn't important, but it flows fast, the action sequences are well staged, the cast are seasoned pros and they deliver, and it is often quite funny. I sat and watched it with a broad smile on my face most of the time.My only quibble is that, while I'm not an expert on the geography of the USA, it seemed to me that people were travelling vast distances overland in very short periods of time without using air flight. But maybe I was missing something.</fullReview>

The storyline maybe is not very exceptional but still in the end I had some surprises. Special effects look very nice and all the action scenes are great. The humor is good, not too much of it, and it's given in good doses and in time.

		<fullReview>One automatically thinks that if the movie has Bruce Willis in it ... its worth more than the price of admission. And this movie is not the exception to the rule! I think one of the reasons I like Bruce Willis, besides his piercing dark eyes staring at me from a parking lot as I made my way home, is that he doesn't have a need to use profanity to make him look and sound tough! By the way, having Bruce Willis' eyes glued to you is quite the compliment! The man is as smooth as a glass of the finest cognac available ... and he has a knack for teaming up with just the right people, when it comes to casting a movie. It would be interesting to get a peek as his list of what he terms to be "his friends!" Anyhoots ... it was nice to see Ernie Borgnine in a movie again. He may not be the best person in the world to stand next to at a cocktail party ... GOD forbid ... but his acting has always been top-notch. And his roles are often as likable as he was in McHale's Navy. Oh My, did I just date myself ... perhaps I should add that I heard he was likable in that series?! Mary-Louise Parker ... what can we say about this weed? The role suited her ... and she suited the role! Mary-Louise is someone I've never met, or even seen around Hollywood ... which can be a good thing. But, putting that aside, Mary-Louise is definitely a pro when it comes to tackling a role and giving her all ... and making it her own! John Malkovich ... one wonders if this kook is as kooky off screen as he is on screen. Another top-notch action hero actor with a quirkiness that makes you want to buy his a couple shots of tequila ... just to see if they straightens out his head. Not that we would want him to be any other way than he normally is ... another wonderful addition to the nut bowl! Hmmm ... I need a cashew! Speaking of cashews ... we come to Helen Mirren, the sex kitten of the over fifty set. Sassy, smart, and ready for whatever action is available ... casting Helen in this "blow the hell out of them all" film was, well, "spot on!" She gives us one heck of a phrase that suits most of our lives ... "Life, sometimes, is complicated!" When isn't it? Helen also proves, in this film, that a woman's accessories are extremely important when it comes to attending high profile charity events. I wonder what kind of accessories Michelle Obama wears ... oh, right ... her husband's check book ... silly me! Morgan Freeman ... his role was too limited, considering that he is as much a powerhouse actor as is Bruce Willis ... however, another powerhouse that had an even smaller role was Richard Dreyfuss.As for Karl Urban ... cute haircut! Just kidding, Karl. The man is gorgeous, and I have a hunch he'd probably make a pretty good James Bond. Although, a tone-up would do wonders for his career, his acting is as solid as it gets! All in all ... love the movie! The special effects are perfect ... a little too perfect ... I think I can go another decade without seeing a person blown to smithereens! Film cutting was excellent! Directing was excellent! I hated seeing that gorgeous house, in the beginning of the movie, destroyed! Actually, it was only the inside that I liked so much! The paint job was exquisite!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been spoiled rotten with action films as of late, when it comes to all star casts. Red is refreshingly creative in its approach, and never has a boring moment. When you have a cast like this one does, it's pretty hard to mess it up, but I was very pleased with it. The fact that it never takes itself very seriously works in its favor. The energy of the cast just seems to permeate throughout. They feed off one another. I wouldn't exactly call this a mainstream action movie. It's a bit quirky at times, but those that are willing to delve into it, will be richly rewarded with a really fun action movie. It does have some enjoyably silly things like Bruce Willis, walking out of a vehicle, unscathed while it's spinning out of control, so he can shoot someone. It has plenty of great explosions, and good fight scenes, especially one involving Bruce Willis &amp; Karl Urban in an office. It was hard hitting and rather nasty. So the mainstream fans will have stuff to enjoy as well. I really liked the dialog. It was intelligent and witty. Bruce Willis is clearly having a blast with this film. He actually plays it low-key for the most part. He had some terrific lines, and was the perfect man to lead this movie. His chemistry with Mary-Louise Parker was a lot of fun. Parker is great as the damsel in distress. I've not seen much of her over the years, but she always impresses me with her acting skills, when I do. Morgan Freeman is hilarious as the cancer stricken patient, who wants to go out in a blaze of glory. Helen Mirren is as classy as they come, and has that special something, not many other actresses do. John Malkovich is delightfully hammy. He stole every scene he was in. Karl Urban plays his oblivious part very well. Aside from Brian Cox's accent, I enjoyed his chemistry with Helen Mirren. Final Thoughts: This is a really fun movie. It's easy to see why it became somewhat of a surprise hit. The energy of the cast is infectious. I'm looking forward to Red 28/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Red movie which stars Bruce Willis is perfectly done well. The script was well written. What makes this movie so much fun is the cast. Bruce Willis is excellent as Frank Moses. He's equally convincing as a retired man living a life of monotony or a world class spy. There's a scene where one moment he's an old man shuffling around his house in a bathrobe, then a moment later he's snapping a hit-man's neck. It's a great transition and that contrast offers up a lot of comic potential that Willis makes the most of. Over all I like all of the main leads playing retired but all of them have the power or training to hit back at someone. These movie is one of my favorites. Its actually addicting and it's something that i could watch over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right up front, it is hard to find a dull moment in this action comedy. Frank Moses(Bruce Willis), is a retired CIA black ops agent having a hard time living a mundane life. The brightest part of his life every month is tearing up his government paycheck and calling to flirt with his case worker, Sarah(Mary-Louis Parker), at the pension process center and unbeknown-st to him, the spy novel fan really enjoyed talking to him. Some unfinished work in his past forces Frank to go back to his work skills in order to stay alive and find who is trying to kill him. Frank gets the nerve to date Sarah, but she unwittingly gets involved with Frank's new activity. The revved up Frank summons old friends to join in the new mission. There is Joe(Morgan Freeman), who is so crafty, he seems to always be a step ahead of everyone else. Marvin(John Malkovich)is a weapons expert, but is a little hindered by his force-fed LSD mind control experiments. Then there is Victoria(Helen Mirren), who is the most adjusted to civilian life; but the former all-around bad ass secret agent is more than happy to join Frank's group. Sarah was at first reluctant to be part of this first date, that ended up in violent fist fights, rapid-fire gunfights and mangling car chases. Sarah soon is excited about living out one of her beloved spy novels. The relationship between Frank and Sarah is full of panic, combat and actually a special kind of romance. RED will have you on the edge of your seat and laughing your butt off. Also in the cast: Rebecca Pidgeon, Karl Urban, Jason Giuliano and John Crest. RED fails to let you leave disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the Cold War, the two sides of the world did their level best to outguess the other, often times, they caused more confusion than not. From the hundreds of people who fought on either sides there were many who were often sacrificed for the good of the cause, only to discover that what they did, was unnecessary. Having wasted millions of dollars in a vain attempt to win for their flawed ideology, there was also the Human cost of the mindless and most assuredly useless endeavor. Therein lies the basis for this film written by Jon and Ereic Hoeber and directed by Robert Schwentke. It tells the story of a group of aging Secred Agents who find themselves retired. Case in point is that of retired Former agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) who one day discovers, someone is trying to kill him. He escapes assignation and flees from the gunmen. In the process, he singles out and kidnaps Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) a lonely, but thrill seeking office worker. Together, they learn of a special Traget List scheduled for termination. Unable to find the killer squads on his own, Moses locates his former agents including Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman) former KGB agent Ivan Simanov (Brian Cox) and Gabriel Singer (James Remar). With special guest stars like Richard Dreyfuss and Ernest Borgnine in key spots throughout the story, this action packed, deception filled, fast-paced and explosive laden movie makes for a terrific and exciting film destine to be a Classic. Great fun. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhere in the opening credits we are told that RED is based on a graphic novel, and I also notice DC Comics logo in there somewhere. That is the key to it all: keep that well in mind if you decide to see this and you probably won't be disappointed. IMDb bills it as a drama, comedy and a thriller, and I suppose that is more or less a reasonable description, although is in not top-notch drama, laugh-out-loud funny or particularly suspenseful. You do, however, want to know what is going on and why it is going on. RED is entertaining enough, but something of a big-budget pot boiler. Bruce Willis does this sort of hard man act standing on his head and I should imagine Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and John Malkovich had rather pressing bills to settle because throughout they are slumming it. But what the hell. RED has no pretensions and if it is nothing but way, way over-the-top 23 carat hokum it is none the worse for that. Take it with a couple of pinches of salt, have several cans of lager to hand and resign yourself to passing a couple of very undemanding hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is bored. A former CIA agent of great importance now living off of retirement, the highlight of his day is when he calls Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker), his benefits representative whom he flirts with. Things take an exciting turn, however, when a hit squad breaks into his house and attempts to kill him. After putting down his new foes, Frank then sets off across the country to round up all of his old comrades (Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren) as he tries to figure out who's trying to kill them and why.Similar to "The A-Team" and "The Losers", "Red" is all about stylized action. It revels in its ridiculousness and has a fine appreciation for over-the-top explosions. Based on a graphic novel, 'Red" doesn't waste time with such issues as reloading, collateral damage, or the laws of physics, something I can certainly admire when done correctly. "Red" left me feeling a bit cheated, though. This movie is a lot of fun but it could have done so much more with the premise. The misuse of such a great cast is criminal. Willis is excellent, bringing visions of an older, more mature, but still awesome version of John McClane. Everyone else seems to be mismatched or out-of-sync as they just aren't given much to do. I have no idea why Morgan Freeman was cast in the first place. If you're not going to use Morgan Freeman then why bother adding him to the equation? Likewise, the story is jumpy, going from place to place, event to event, without much development or wrap-up. It's a bit like a video game as our heroes (or anti-heroes as the case may be) go from level to level. And just like "The Losers", "Red" lacks a compelling villain which could have helped me overlook the movie's other flaws. It has its moments (mostly in the first half), not to mention an excellent supporting part from Bryan Cox, and I can't deny the entertainment value as a whole. I simply expect an action movie with this level of talented actors to provide me more than above average entertainment.Check out my site: www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com</fullReview>

John Malkovich plays semi-crazy better than anyone out there, and does so with zest here. Mary-Louise Parker was also fun in her fantasy-come-true adventure role. Honorable mention to Morgan Freeman and Ernest Borgnine (at 93!). To enjoy this sort of film you have to get past a few plot holes, such as government agents firing thousands of rounds in public with no obvious curiosity by the media.

		<fullReview>So... Turns out the Americans ?re capable of bringing quite solid 'comedy' movies to the big screen (without making them about sex-driven teens or road trips with a story as flat as the tarmac it's set on). These past few years we have been blessed with pictures like "The Hangover", "Knight and Day", "The A-team" (ok, maybe that was an accidental-comedy), the "OMG, it's Sarah Palin!"-line from "Did you hear about the Morgans" and then some more which don't come to mind now...Red is the kind of movie you don't watch when you're expecting a spy-thriller. (Even though that would have been a fair expectation before they put Bruce Willis on the cast-list, no offence Bruce.) The movie has a story that's not too very deep which, in this context, is kind of a good thing. Within the first 10 minutes we get our first show of excessive violence, without getting too Rambo. I notice an honest smile on my face. Good work. It sets the tone for the whole thing immediately, mocking violence-dripped movies and having deeply funny dialogues at the same time.When I first browsed the cast I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I can assure you that performances in this movie are certainly nothing to complain about. With an extremely funny John Malkovich and a very convincing Helen Mirren at the top of my rating.All 'n all this movie brings you over 100 minutes of fun, without becoming a drag halfway through the movie. It actually h?s a plot, kind of... So there ?s a hint of suspense, but only a spoonful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the type of film that is really entertaining and fun that is mindless entertainment. Because it is not highbrow the inclination is to downgrade it. Even as a blockbuster it came in at around 38th or so. But there was no film in 2010 I enjoyed as much. I think this one is worth buying on Blu-ray.The action is top notch and even hilarious. The film is fast-paced and a nice length (1 hour and 51 minutes). Karl Urban as the main FBI proponent is well enough developed to not be totally unlikeable as the bad guy.Some of the dialogue may take a page from Tarantino, but I like the script. I would like to see a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew this movie was going to be good once I saw all the big players, but DANG! It simply blew me away! Great action with comedy in just the right places. I was on the roller-coaster in the 1st few minutes and rode it all the way home.While I've pretty much always been a fan of Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman rides in my Top 5 list of Actors. He certainly keeps in that top 5 list in this movie.And two other huge numbers, Dame Helen Mirren and John Malkovich! WOW! Both of these top-notch actors continue like gang-busters, again, holding true to their ratings as great entertainers of the silver screen.Totally one of the best movies of 2010.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed Red. It's too bad that they don't make action movies like this anymore. This movie is for plain fun and will not win any major awards(I was surprised that this was Golden Globe nominated.) This movie also proves that the older generation still know how to kick some serious butt.This is about how a group of retired agents join forces together again to hunt down the ones who just tried to assassinate them.The cast is perfect. Bruce Willis stills has his action mojo. John Malkovich really played his part well as the crazy guy. The best part was Helen Mirren. It was funny to see the dame lift that enormous gun.Overall, this is a good action/comedy movie. I really hope they do make a second one. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red Alert Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a long time there's finally a cool fun action movie. Silly may be one of the adjectives used to describe 'Red' but that doesn't prevent it from being entertaining nonetheless. While there's plenty of action sequences that involve fights, gunshots and explosions, it is the dialogue and chemistry between the actors that made this movie. The impressive ensemble too is quite unique. Who would have expected to see Bruce Willis, Mary Louise Parker, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfuss and Morgan Freeman in the same film? All the actors do a great job even though I felt that Freeman's character was more of the token black guy. It's fun to see Mirren play a hot dame with a machine gun and Parker do more comedy. Malkovich too is hilarious as the slightly paranoid one who thinks everyone's out to kill him. 'Red' has plenty of laugh-out-loud moments to brighten one's mood. It's certainly not a bad choice to watch with friends or family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be a perfect mix of genres. The action wasn't overdone like most movies and the comedy couldn't have been better timed. Even though the film was centred around a romantic idea it wasn't a romance, more an attempt to lead a normal life. Leaving this movie more in the action genre than romance.The characters were well casted and really meshed giving the movie a real feel. Bruce as always was a great lead, making you not only want to know what happens but need to know what happens.The surprises throughout the movie were great and you never knew what to expect even though the storyline was very similar to a lot of other movies and you could tell what the end product would be.In conclusion I would say that this movie is a must see, settle in and get ready to laugh as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Red ? Review My rating ? 3/5I'd like to call RED a comedy more than a thriller. Coz if you expect to see a thriller you will expect it to be serious. RED is not that serious thriller. True it has thundering big explosions and million rounds of ammunition released towards a house until it falls down but that's all doesn't seems to be 'that' serious. RED has a league of retired special black ops team members kicking young people's butts. Maybe all the old dudes would love it if the world is like that. But in reality I don't think so. The plot is about Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) , a retired special ops member from CIA trying to get in to the roots of reasons why some people are trying to assassinate him and his old buddies. And I don't know how but his so called girl friend who he has fallen in love for her voice also thinks that it's a good idea to tag alone. Either she is completely dumb or insanely stupid or both. So while Frank is on his 'quest' he gather few of his good old days assassination buddies to the ride and make a hell of a scenes in few places. He practically sneak in to the CIA like it's another usual government office (Along with his dumb/stupid girlfriend) to check on some of his old operation files. And then instantly plan and executive a massive kidnap plan which vice president of USA is the target. Don't get amused. It's a comedy after all. Especially when there is 'Rajini Kanth' style action all over I'd bet all my chips on Frank. Packed with heaven high explosions and bullet exchanges time to time RED is not a bad movie after all. But it's not a good movie either. You decide!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One word to describe this film.FUN.Very very fun.With thrilling action sequences containing some truly awesome fight scenes and slow motion bullet firing, a great cast of oldies that have shown they've still got it and very funny jokes, RED is a truly fun ride to enjoy.It follows Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) who is a retired CIA agent. At night a group of armed man break into his house and attempt to kill him. He escapes, taking along a clueless woman (Mary Louise Parker from TV's Weeds.) He soon discovers him and his former CIA associates have been targeted for assassination.Basically it's Willis, Helen Mirren (with a machine gun), Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich (in a hilarious performance) kicking some serious ass and showing that their age has nothing to do with their ability as CIA agents.If you love action/comedies, you'll love this.9/10</fullReview>

An over the top enjoyable romp that's not trying to take its self too seriously and worth a watch even just to see Helen Mirren in cocktail wear and army boots managing to look sophisticated manning a heave duty machine gun.

		<shortDescription>"Old man, my ass!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering the exponential growth in the number of movies based on comics to premiere in theatres worldwide in the last three years, it was just a matter of time before Warren Ellis's award winning graphic novel (about a retired hit man struggling to find the truth behind the real reasons the CIA is after him) hit the big screens. Those who are familiar with the Ellis's writing and Cully Hammer's drawings know that the content can be quite brutal so it would be perfectly normal to expect a "new" Kick-Ass. However, Paramount had other plans and decided to reduce the core violence to two or three scenes a little bit more intense but accessible to all teenagers. The outcome is, shall we say, ambiguous.Red is one of those movies that simply cannot be taken too seriously. Trying to make him something more than just entertainment would be a huge mistake that certainly would ruin the whole cinematic experience. It can be extremely funny and thrilling but the sum of all parts doesn't add up to a great film. John and Erich Hober's script cannot dodge some common stereotypes in this kind of action/comedy flick originating some boring and insipid scenes. Over the top explosions, green screen shots and slow motion are just some examples of this tiresome new way of making movies that base important decisions on poor judgment (in a desperate attempt to captivate more spectators) instead of intelligently thought shots. Nonetheless, Red is an undeniable charming movie bringing the Coen's filmography to mind a few times, mainly through its dark humor and crazy situations. Of course it never reaches the magnificence of their movies (most of them anyway) but then again, it never really tries. Red has a strong identity and tries to maintain it during 111 minutes. And if anyone is responsible for that consistency, that person is John Malkovich who manages to steal the show in each screen appearance with is obsessive and paranoid insanely amusing character. Helen Mirren rivals Malkovich as Red's best character. It is impossible to neglect her royal pose as she his wiping bad guys from the face of the earth. Bruce Willis plays his typical The Whole Ten Yards part and can be pretty competent although it would be a pleasant surprise to see him work his character a little bit more, namely by adding some vitality to this kind of personality. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, wasn't very successful or relevant. His importance to the world of cinema demanded more than just being lost on set.Aside from the performances, the surprising cinematography and the appropriate soundtrack, Red really isn't a relevant picture in todays' cinema. However, it can be highly entertaining. If the viewer's main purpose is to relax and laugh for two hours, then this is the movie to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RED or Retired, Extremely Dangerous, is the tag given to Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), a retired Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) black ops operative who spends most of his days chatting on the phone with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker). However, that changes when his former employers try to have him eliminated.This film is probably a better version of 'The Expendables'. All the main characters are retired and no further use to the agency except for Sarah who has become an unwilling (at first) party.The best character in the film is Marvin (John Malkovich) who is paranoid but seems to be right about his paranoia more than half the time. Together with Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), Victoria (Helen Mirren), a former MI6 agent and Ivan Simanov (Brian Cox) a Russian agent; the team set out to find the reason for the sudden hit on Moses.RED, once again, shows us that class and experience never dies.</fullReview>

The 4 RED operatives, Willis, Malkovich, Freeman and Mirren, all work very well together and seem like they had fun shooting this movie, which comes across perfectly within the film.The action and stunts are very impressive, considering its the same team that brought you The Dark Knight and The Bourne Ultimatum, while the comedy is refreshing and from a new angle, older people as hit-man/woman.A rather under-rated and overlooked performance from the brilliant Karl Urban, as William Cooper, the man sent to catch the RED operatives, and fantastic comedy relief from Mary-Louise Parker, who plays Sarah Ross, and a memorable cameo from Ernest Borgnine, who plays a records keeper despite his most current role (albeit Voice Acting) being the extremely forgetful and docile 'Mermaid Man' in Spongebob Squarepants.Definitely worth a watch for all the reason above, it's now in my Top 25 films and if you need and more persuasion I'll say one thing, there's a pig teddy with a rather intriguing purpose ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unapologetic fun, with its share of flaws and lots of charm from its stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red is based on a graphic novel by the great comic book author Warren Ellis. To say that his first adaptation to screen isn't like the book very much might be an understatement (I've yet to read it, but it's missing things like, say, the ensemble, and much of the humor). But this isn't always a terrible thing, if the director's intentions are in the right place. For the movie of Red (or RED, with each letter coming out to be some kind of CIA thing), it's meant to be a romp with aging action stars and the gifted actors who are above 50. It says a lot of the faith in a project- and the durability of its players- when the youngin' in the group is Bruce Willis (not counting Mary Louise Parker, who is really just along for the ride). And all of the actors, almost despite the silly nature of the script at times, are game for what's doing in a story of CIA operatives brought back into the game of things.Frank Moses is living low in a setting not unlike the one Willis was in in the Whole Nine Yard movies. He finds one night, however, that a small militia is at his house at night and opens fire. Why is he targeted? What about other operatives like the in-old-age-home Joe (Morgan Freeman), or the stay-at-home lovely old lady with a big f***ing gun Victoria (Helen Mirren), or the (putting it lightly) paranoid and (putting it exactly) maniac Marvin (Malkovich). And what about this 'average Joe-ette' in Sarah, who is really along for the ride as she's been having innocent conversations as Frank's pension planner? And why is she sticking with him for so long and getting into it as much as she does?This last question is the only one that really stuck in my craw. Like another spy-on-the-lam-on-the-lover movie this year, Knight and Day with Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, it is questionable to a fault, even with the suspend-disbelief nature of the material, that a woman who doesn't really want much to do with this guy ends up not only getting into the swing of the killing-things but also falling for Frank. This is the weak link in a story that should have a believable relationship at its center, and it doesn't really. I didn't buy the two of them together, even as Willis and Parker weren't giving bad performances... not very good either, but acceptable.So what else is there? The other actors, for one. Malkovich plays this ex-CIA guy, living in a bunker and still reeling from the every-day-for- 11-years acid trip he took and thinking anyone following him is out to kill him (and helicopters man!), with total dedication and raucous insanity. It's a pleasure to see him at work, and it's one of his most sheerly enjoyable performances, one where he isn't quite coasting but is knowing what has to be done to take the p**s out of the material. Mirren brings some class to the material too and is fine to watch, though she comes in just a wee too late to really make an impact like Malkovich - her firing lots and lots of guns does make for entertaining viewing. And Freeman, also not quite substantial a role, albeit his final scene in the movie is as good as anything he's ever done (by that I mean his best work, a mixture of hilarity and serious pathos).The action goes at a brisk and cool pace, and there's a bad-ass stand- off between Malkovich and a bunch of thugs in a docking station (sure, not believable, but it's funny, that's what counts here). The director Schwentke does go overboard with the music- it's goofy, TV style- and, again, the main romance doesn't quite click. Everything else is good, solid escapism, with well-choreographed fights such as one between Willis and Karl Urban that has a bit of adrenaline to go a long way, and likable 'serious' actors getting to have some fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Red, retired extremely dangerous. Those terms are to describe Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Hellen Mirren, Mary Louise Parker, and Morgan Freeman. The cast is very well known, three out of five won Oscars. But the cast has nothing to do with the movie's stylish direction with its tough attitude. The director has this crazy attitude to direct a movie that's fun and enjoyable for both the audience and its cast. Considering that people in the cast is elite actors, this is kind of a fun project for them, something enjoyable instead of intense acting. That's what made the movie fun, the cast knew that this isn't that serious and they tried to have fun with it. We felt the charm of Bruce Willis and Mary Louise Parker. We felt cool when Hellen Mirren picks up a gun. And we felt disgusted when Morgan Freeman tried to score some booty. But most of all, we felt this is better entertainment than some big budget movie.?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a breathtaking sequence Bruce Willis's Frank Moses swerves his car protecting Mary-Louise Parker's Sarah Ross on-board. As the car door opens, Frank steps out, draws his Gloch, and fires into the Navigator windshield with CIA lead William Cooper (Karl Urban) behind the wheel. Retired CIA operative Frank hasn't lost his edge. "RED" is an enjoyable surprise. Director Robert Schwentke keeps it fast, furious, and fun working from the taut clever screenplay by Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber. "RED" is based on the DC Comic by Warren Ellis and Cully Hammer. RED stands for Retired and Extremely Dangerous. In "RED" the CIA's most deadly retired agents find themselves targets of a covert assassination conspiracy. Now forced rogue, they must unravel the principle thread, and kill the man responsible.The charm of "RED" underlies its character and singularity. What culminates in "RED" is its story of honor. Bruce Willis is awesome, and at his grizzled best. I love Mary-Louise Parker, who is both quirky and sexy. Morgan Freeman is whimsically powerful. John Malkovich is completely out there as paranoid freak job Marvin. Karl Urban is amazing. As William Cooper, the CIA agent assigned to terminate Frank, he is a charismatic presence governed by a noble cause. Director Schwentke brilliantly blurs the line between good and bad, distinguishing the noble cause beyond their borders.Isolated Frank (Willis) fosters a romantic relationship with Sarah (Parker) over the phone. She is the government employee, who issues Frank his monthly pension checks. Frank is the self-imposed recluse in snowbound Cleveland. Sarah inhabits her florescent lit cubicle in the Kansas City Office. She daydreams of escaping the daily grind. Be careful what you wish for.Frank musters up the courage to ask Sarah out for a date, having business in Kansas City. Under Black Ops surveillance, a kill team strikes Frank's residence. However, Frank brutally dispatches the team with firepower and martial arts skills. Realizing the deadly conspiracy, Frank kidnaps Sarah. She admits later, "? not my best first date." Sarah reluctantly distinguishes that she is dead without Frank. On the road and on the run they reunite with Frank's team mate Joe (Freeman) at a senior's home in New Orleans. Joe has terminal cancer. Obtaining more mission intelligence, Frank and Sarah meet up with Marvin (Malkovich), survivalist holdout and Ops LSD victim.They thwart more kill teams. In desperate resort, Frank brazenly infiltrates Langley. He obtains the Top Secret file from archive keeper played by reliable Ernest Borgnine. Frank violently schools Cooper (Urban), and barely escapes. Losses are taken; his team seeks refuge with semi-retired Victoria (amazing Helen Mirren) at her bed and breakfast in Virginia. The "band is back together". Apparently their operation in Guatemala 30 years ago is the fatal tie. Their assassination orders may come from the highest chain of command.Frank has a possible weakness or power?he is falling for Sarah?"I really like her." Motherly Victoria confides, "Frank, you're such a romantic." On the snow covered knoll armed with her sniper rifle Victoria warns Sarah that "if you break his heart", she will hunt her down, kill her, and bury her in the woods. Wide-eyed Sarah says, "OK." This is the guilty pleasure of "RED". "RED" has a comic convolution and paradoxical gravitas. The cast is impeccable. Mirren is awesome. As Victoria she also compromised a past mission shooting her lover Ivan (the great Brian Cox) 3 times in the chest, following orders. At the moving story arc, Willis hugs Freeman, saying, "It's been an honor." Schwentke expertly balances the vibrant action, whimsy, and gravity. Ultimately, "RED" is about fighting for the just cause, for love, and for honor. That is worth going to movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is not a great movie, but I took a pleasant surprise with it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Alan Moore and Glenn Morrison, I think Warren Ellis is my favorite writer of comics; and even though his fame was established by formal series (such as Transmetropolitan, Planetary and Hellblazer), I think that his huge narrative ingenuity is better displayed in the mini-series he wrote for independent (or "semi-independent") publishing houses.As much as I enjoyed his bizarre period as a writer of Ultimate Fantastic Four, I personally prefer the exuberant pleasures and overflowing imagination from Global Frequency, Desolation Jones and Ocean.Having said all that, I have to admit that I never found his mini-series Red to be particularly exceptional, so I did not have very big expectations for its film adaptation.However, I surprisingly liked the film Red more than the comic, thanks to Jon and Erich Hoeber's entertaining screenplay and Robert Schwentke's solid direction.In summary, I took a pleasant surprise with this film.The differences between the comic and the film do not only consist in the introduction of new characters and villains, but also in an essential change of the tone from the story.The graphic novel Red is a cruel and violent examination of the "price of freedom", and the havoc that causes in the soul of those who accept to commit atrocities in order to protect the interests from a country.On the contrary, the film Red tells a light and dynamic story, which is full of humor, but without neglecting the suspense and the emotions from the characters.Its basic premise is similar to the recent The Losers or, for the case, to many other films about secret agents who are betrayed by the government, such as Secret Agent, The Bourne Identity, Salt and Mission Impossible III.The point is that the story may not be very original, but that is offset by its ingenious execution, the solid performances and the interesting characters, whose interaction with each other organically impulses the movie and wakes our interest in their destinies.In other words, even though Red is an action film, its best moments are not the stunts or shootouts (which are anyway very good), but the dramatic moments between the main characters, or the encounter with a love from the past, or the small revelations which suggest the weight the characters carry in their consciences.Bruce Willis makes a competent work in the action scenes as well as in the dramatic ones.I also liked Mary Louise Parker's performance as Willis' character's love interest.However, I think that Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich bring the best performances, not only because they make their characters to be likable to the spectator, but also because of their subtle gestures which reveal the complexity of the personal story from their characters without words.And I think that Karl Urban is also solid as the villain; his character in here is very similar to the one he interpreted in The Bourne Supremacy, but in Red, he brings his character something which makes it different.I think that Urban is a very underrated actor, but I would not be surprised if we saw him in the "A-list" from Hollywood a few years later, because he would certainly deserve it.In conclusion, Red may not be an excellent movie, but I found it to be very entertaining, so I recommend it.Oh, and I have to make a warning to the fans of Ellis: the violence in Red is what we would expect in a PG-13 movie, so you do not have to expect the famous head-shots or the creative way of killing enemies from the comic.Personally, I did not need the presence of gore or strong violence in the movie, because the screenplay, the performances and the direction were more than enough to leave me satisfied.</fullReview>

With stars like Bruce Willis, Mary-Louise Parker, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich (what a month he's having appearing in both this and Secretariat which we also enjoyed), Helen Mirren, Richard Dreyfuss, and Ernest Borgnine (wow, in his 90s and still active), Red provided plenty of pleasures in the thrilling department while also slowing down enough to get you to know the characters and their backgrounds. And seeing many scenes from New Orleans-which happen to be a two-hour drive from where me and my aforementioned friend live-was an additional treat.

		<fullReview>Red must've been a blast to make. The entire cast look like they enjoyed it immensely. It's not a surprise really. I'm sure they thought their gun-toting days were well and truly over. Dame Helen Mirren's list of things to achieve in her illustrious career probably didn't feature shooting a massive automatic weapon at dozens of Secret Service agents. I doubt Malkovich considered he would be swatting grenades with the butt of a rifle at the ripe old age of 57. To be fair, Willis has still been kicking around the last couple of years with underwhelming actioners like Surrogates and Cop Out, but this is a welcome return to form for him at any rate. The younglings, Parker and Urban, look chuffed to share screen time with the seasoned vets as well, although Parker's 'confused waif' persona grinds on the nerves very quickly.Those expecting the family-friendly, Space Cowboys level of action will be in for a shock. Red is not soft. Although very funny in parts and featuring a tongue-in-cheek vibe throughout ? Jon and Erich Hoeber's humorous script deserves credit for that ? Red is an action flick first and foremost. Featuring one of the most hard-hitting fight sequences this year ? Willis and Urban's bruising office melee ? this graphic-novel adaptation doesn't hold back. More importantly though the set pieces convince, thanks to respectable CGI, well-staged gun fights and stirring camera work. And the sound design is loud. Very loud. Perhaps to accommodate the seniors groups who unwisely choose this as their monthly Morgan Freeman movie.Different ? and better ? than expected. This sneaky blockbuster punches above its weight and below its age.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Fine, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun, entertaining, suspenseful, funny action movie that is driven by great, enjoyable characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to sum up this movie in one sentence, it would be a fun, entertaining, suspenseful, funny action movie that is driven by great, enjoyable characters. Sure, there's an all-star cast: Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren, but every one of them makes a character of his/her own. Willis, whom over the years has come across as a seemingly ordinary guy, but when messed with, he comes off as a tough, no nonsense, cliché one-liner hero. He follows this formula perfectly. His initial appearance is a quiet, simple, lonely middle-aged guy who lives in suburbia. Everything he does is routine?he wakes up at 6 a.m., works out in his basement, eats breakfast, you get the picture. But when his idyllic home is blown to hell (literally) from mysterious men in black outfits, armed to the teeth with machine guns, he reveals himself as a gifted fighter and marksmen?the old Bruce Willis is back and better than ever. If you're looking for humor, look no further than John Malkovich. He often plays nutty roles, and this is one of his best. His character paranoid and somewhat delusional, but he holds a charm that makes him probably the most lovable character in this film. His delivery of lines is priceless and the demeanor he carries for his role is perfect. Perhaps he can get an Oscar nomination for his role (maybe unlikely, but I sure hope so). Morgan Freeman (whom I never thought of as an action hero) holds himself as the old wise man that he always portrays in movies. But beneath the age, he always has a card up his sleeve in case of a deadly situation. Helen Mirren is the similar, but she has a taste for the dangerous, always wielding a gun of some sort?just in case. And for someone her age, she is gorgeous. Other great roles are delivered by Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfus, Karl Urban, Mary Louise-Parker (whom I've never seen before), as well as multiple others. The editing, sound, music, camera work, and lighting are all flawless. The pace is moderate. The 1 hour and 51 minutes did not fly by, but I wasn't bored at all. The story was mostly good, but it could've been better, then again, it's an action flick. Story is not the main goal. For an action flick, this movie has it all. Humor. Explosions. Gunfire. Even a brutal martial arts fight and a sense of the ridiculous. And once again, brilliant characters. 3.5/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that was cool! Having seen the trailer for this the last time we were at the movie theatre I was kinda like... I don't know? It's one of those movies i just said hey, what the heck? and walked in to see. Good thing too cause this is a crafty little story about 4 retired black ops members who reunite after the government they worked so hard for and trained them are now trying to eliminate them before they expose a botched up war mission that an elected official ordered the slaying of a bunch of people illegally. The youngest member Frank (Bruce Willis) has been having a tough time dealing with retirement. In a lonesome bid he constantly rips up his pension cheques as so he can talk to government worker Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) well in customer service you always are wondering who you are talking to at the other end of the phone. Instead of asking Sarah for a date she ends up in a crazy journey with Frank as he and the other members of team Red Joe(Morgan Freeman) Victoria (Helen Mirren ) and Marvin (John Malkovich) go up against the lies of the Cia and the secret service in order to bring a highly elected official to justice. Greatstoryline with a fantastic cast involved. I personally find Willis's current career path a little more on the miss side then the hit side these days, but make no doubts about it this one hits a home run!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce and Mary Louis parker were really a humorous couple...i think this was not meant to be great hit at the box office.. but did a fair job as a humorous action flick.it started of with Bruce as a retired CIA who has nothing really happening for him in his retired life except for few daily routine activities that he is programmed himself doing.one such activity is talking to Mary who happens to be a customer service representative. whom he somehow convinces to meet up with. Mary who is single and also bored due to not finding the right guy, agrees meeting up with him.things don't go too well on their first meeting and the adventure starts from there on for Mary.the ending is a little too dramatic..but overall its a watchable movie especially if you are a fan of Bruce Willis.

		<fullReview>In short, a good movie which makes the most of a stellar cast.Willis is in top form from start to finish in this action packed romp of a film - Willis doing what Willis does best. In fact, all of the cast combine surprisingly well together to create lots of chuckles amongst a plethora of explosions and gun fights.Malkovich is the main culprit for giggles, playing a zany ex CIA operative, obsessed with weaponry and who has spent many a year high on LSD - cue guns encased in a cuddly pig teddy! Mirren plays an ice-cold sniper with a heart which in a way combines elements of both her Prime Suspect self and her Calender Girls self Freeman is typically Freeman, playing a wise old head who thinks of everyone before himself, cue the string quartet for the emotional 'I miss the good ol days' speeches. But the best surprise was seeing Brian Cox back in action. No nonsense Brian Cox who it seems dominates channel 5 and ITV 2 at times for the sheer amount of 90's films he appeared in. Usually associated with being the bad guy, who does he play in this film? A Russian agent. Brilliant decision to cast him, nuff said.In the future I can see this film appearing many a time on TV around the holidays, almost akin to Die Hard and Mission Impossible, and I for one will always make time to watch it as I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. The film knows exactly what it should be and doesn't pretend or try to be anything else - Action/Comedy at its best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Helen Mirren doesn't appear till halfway through RED, playing an ex-MI6 assassin who still freelances and certainly demonstrates her skill with machine guns and grenade-launchers when the going gets tough. It's more than a little disconcerting to see an actress who not so long ago played Our Gracious Queen now out there as a rogue hitwoman! The plot is not exactly loaded down with plausibility but the chases and shoot-outs come thick and fast, and it's clear that the cast are having fun and you find yourself going along with this, much as you do with the panto-style antics in the Pirates of the Caribbean series. Mary-Louise Parker as Bruce Willis's innocent-caught-up-in-mayhem girlfriend provides a neat focal point for the viewer. John Malkovich gives an eye-rolling performance much as he did in Con Air. Brian Cox's Russian spymaster belongs in Round the Horne! There's even a cameo from Ernest Borgnine (always find myself thinking of the famous Ethel Merman story about her 50-year-old you-know-what!), now a sprightly 93. Bullets fly like snowflakes in a blizzard but not too many people seem to get shot. There's no gore and a (very) welcome drought of profanity.RED is not exactly up there with the best of the Jason Bourne franchise. In fact it's down there with some of the dafter Roger Moore Bonds, like Octopussy and A View to a Kill. But, like them, it's an easy movie to sit back and be carried away by. For us older viewers it seems to suggest that if Life didn't start at Forty, it maybe will at Sixty-Five!</fullReview>

And since it's a fun fairy tale and each and every role is performed to perfection, the pace is just right and whatever fault I could find with the film becomes immaterial (and even if you decide to go for the details you'll have to admit all this faults are minor details).So that's all I have to say - I had fun seeing it, every one taking part in making it looks like enjoying it immensely - come join the party.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Red Still Armed, Still dangerous, Still got it Red is based off the DC comic book of the same name. It surrounds Frank Moses. An Ex-CIA man Frank is threatened by a group of assassins, he decides to bring together his old team and uncover a government conspiracy that threatens them and the other Ex-CIA agents. The film helms Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren.The film has a excellent cast, Bruce Willis still showing how great a actor he can be. Morgan Freeman is underused and doesn't get much screen time but the time he does have he delivers the same great performance that we love. Helen Mirren's character is a nice twist as she plays a gun toting pensioner who's hobby's differ from knitting to taking the old assassination contract. And John Malkovich is the best part of the film. Every time he comes on screen he delivers a laugh and makes his scenes really fun to watch. The story is rather average for this film but I can tell that Robert Schwentke was trying to make it interesting so I'll give him a point on that. Mary Louise Parker was a nice addition too and is nice to see her in a action role.The film's main problem is at how predictable it is, it comes across as a straight forward action flick, with some comedy and romance thrown in. But it's a fun one at that. This may just be a problem that I only have but it would have been nice if the film was given a 15 rating. For a film called Red, you'd expect a bit of blood and gore thrown in. But that's just a small problem I have with it.Red is definitely a fun film and should be seen with a few friends. You will get your money's worth. Plus John Malkovich and Helen Mirren toting a machine gun thrown in too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well as far as espionage films go, this one was a bit more light hearted. To see retired agents back in the line of duty so to speak to stop an on going hit against those who worked for their own. Bruce Willis plays an agent who is declared by his peers as the best there is in the spy business. A man who can kill at the drop of a hat in an instant. At his side is a girl who he corresponds with during his retirement, only to be dragged into more deeper shenanigans as a dark and sinister man (dreyfuss) is pulling strings to stop Willis and his entourage from fulfilling their well trained duties. This film holds all aspects of action, humour, and to see legendary actors play together which adds to the wonderful flavor, that no matter how old you get, experience is key to show those young agents that are full of vinegar and extra strength wind not to screw with seasoned Red's. John Malkovich was also very enjoyable as the paranoid ex agent who still believes that satellites, Cell phones, and the internet is the cause of mans down fall. Excellent addition with Morgan Freeman. And a wonderful love tale between Helen Mirren and Brian Cox. The audience will adore this film, brilliant cast, brilliant movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes you need to let the cast do the work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes making an entertaining movie is no more complicated than having a good concept, a great cast and then getting out of the way. That's certainly the case with Red, which never tries to be anything more than a series of scenes that say "Look at John Malkovich be funny! Look at Mary-Louise Parker be cute! Look at this cool stunt with Bruce Willis!" No, it's not a particularly elevated form of filmmaking but who gives a damn about that as long as it's fun? Director Robert Schwentke and writers Jon and Erich Hoeber, who adapted their script from the original comic book, keep things nice and simple. In both comedy and action, they set up and stick to a fairly consistent rhythm of set-up and punch line. It may seem uninspired but better that than falling into any of the gaping traps of trying to be too serious, edgy or pretentious in this kind of tale.Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is a recently retired CIA operative who's spends his days puttering around his house and tearing up his pension checks so he has an excuse to call his customer service agent, Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker). T heir conversations have turned into pre-date flirting that both of them enjoy. Who knows where it would have led if a team of assassins hadn't tried to murder Frank in his home, sending him on the run and forcing him to abduct Sarah to keep her safe. As Frank tries to figure out who's trying to kill him, he assembles a team of old comrades who are also "Retired - Extremely Dangerous" (John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren). Meanwhile, the CIA dispatches an assassin of their own (Karl Urban) to bring Frank down. What slowly unfolds is a conspiracy that reaches to almost the highest levels of government and forces some characters to question their allegiance.Red is an action-comedy that decides early on it's more about comedy than action and sticks to that through the whole film. From Mary-Louise Parker's frazzled woman who never expected the man of her dreams to tie her up and put duct tape over her mouth, to John Malkovich's paranoid sociopath who was right about the government being out to get him, to Helen Mirren and Brian Cox as starcrossed septuagenarian lovers, things are played for laughs rather than excitement or thrills. On the few occasions when the story gets close to dark moralizing about "black ops" evils, it quickly pulls back into a more prankish attitude. Not that there aren't a few decent dust ups with the shooting and the punching and the exploding of stuff, but this movie is about as serious on spying as Ghostbusters was on the paranormal.The stars of the show are Parker, Mirren and Malkovich and kudos to Willis and Morgan Freeman for letting others steal the spotlight. Parker is completely adorable, even though she's reduced to a prop for a good bit of the end of the film. Mirren and Malkovich prove once again that when you're as good as they are, acting for the laugh can be just as compelling as the most dramatic of tear-drenched monologues.Moving at a good clip, the linear plot keeps both the jokes and the action scenes flowing and Willis' presence anchors the tone and keeps it from flying too far in one direction or the other. His use here is a great example of how "movie star stature" can benefit a picture.Red is a mostly solid, funny and energetic little romp. If you haven't seen it, you should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not at all the type of film I normally watch, but I liked it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I some ways, I am not the best person to watch this film. While I have reviewed over 12500 movies so far, practically none of them were action films. It's one of my least favorite genres and to me, a lot of them look the same. I don't particularly care about explosions, machismo and the like. So why did I watch it? My uncle was in town and he wanted to see the film again...and I went on to be a good sport. Well, although the film didn't completely win me over to the genre, it was enjoyable and the sort of film a non-fan could enjoy.The film begins in a rather mundane way. Bruce Willis is living in his suburban home--talking on the phone to a customer service lady. It seems they talk a lot and you can tell he really likes her--and he tells her he's coming to her town soon. However, it occurs MUCH sooner than either expected--as men in black attack Willis' home and try to kill him! He dispatches them quickly--leading you to believe it ain't just an ordinary guy!! And, from here on, he and his lady friend embark on a crazy adventure with LOTS of secret agents trying to kill them! Why? See the film for yourself."Red" works because the plot has some clever twists but more importantly because of some of the supporting characters--in particular the crazy guy played by John Malkovich. The film never takes itself all that seriously and has some clever moments--but, unfortunately, like too many films in the genre, a few too many explosions and gunfire exchanges (and practically NO ONE seems to die when 28408234012319 shots are fired). Not great but very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is basically throw away formula and yet it is rather enticing. This is probably because it uses some of Hollywood's most recognizable faces. The plot is unimportant other than to be used to keep things moving toward and end. The film tries to convince us that these older people have lost none of their touch. Some of them are trained killers; others are probably sociopaths. They do have a nice commitment to each other as representatives of a group generally ignored. Nevertheless, like Lancaster in Atlantic City, they work their magic and move quickly and skillfully, doing the job they set out to do. Nothing great. Just an entertaining movie. Willis is his usual smirking self. Freeman works his usual magic. The lady is nuts. Take it to the bank.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red-Blooded American Funtime.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A shoot-em-up, rock-em sock-em age-fest.RED is Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman; they're ex-CIA, Retired Extremely Dangerous. You betcha - each of these operatives could wipe out whole cities: Willis with his arctic cool, Malko with his leering morbidity, Helen Mirren with her sexagenarian sexiness and Morgan Freeman with his pompous voice-over.The four principals have more years between them than all the stars of HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL combined. Ironically, watching HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL can kill you faster than any RED.From a DC Comics graphic novel (by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner), RED follows Frank Moses (Willis) as he evades CIA operatives sent to kill him, led by Cooper (Karl Urban). It's easy to evade bad guys in movies who still can't aim after all those years of CIA training. Yes, it's the yawn plot device of CIA trying to kill its own ex-operatives. Frank recruits his old team mates to get to the bottom of why. (Why? Because it's the CIA, stupid! That's what they do.) Cooper culls Frank's file from curmudgeonly CIA analyst, Ernest Borgnine (that guy's still alive?!).Beautiful Mary-Louise Parker is Sarah, a cubicled government accountant who dwells romantically on her spy novels, merely a phone flirtation for Frank, until he inadvertently pulls her into the chase and she finds herself on the lam with an All-American Hero more virile than any Fabio-based cover model. Her wonderment, amusement and sensual excitement are pitch-perfect, with just that right dash of spinner cuteness. Positively glowing.Brian Cox is The Russian Guy. Was Rade Sherbedgia busy? Suddenly - Richard Dreyfuss! He's a slimy weapons contractor (cough--Halliburton) who's been using the CIA as his personal hit squad (cough--Dick Cheney-- Didn't Dreyfuss already play that low swine in W.?) RED is solid action-comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously, yet seriously commits to delivering cheeky China White straight-to-the-vein outlandish bombast. Just how drunk was the stunt coordinator who thought up the eye-popping gag of Willis stepping from a spinning car, guns aimed and blazing? And how uber cool (and slightly sexually arousing) is Helen Mirren pumping an automatic machine gun or Bruce Willis in hand-to-hand combat beating up on some guy half his age? Of course, the mindless action would be immaterial were it not punctuated by the personalities of the principals; Willis, Malkovich, Mirren and Freeman armed not only with guns that never run out of ammo, but a dry, deadly wit that only comes with the accumulation of years that these wolves have spent howling at the moon.</fullReview>

Although Morgan was absent for most of the film.Plot was somewhat unplausible but none-the-less entertaining. John was hilariously brilliant as always.One Major plot issue. Bruce's character arrives at his 'girlfirend's' house only to see the wet team arrive. All seemed to make sense until 10/15 minutes later the main CIA guy is on the jet going through Bruce's belongings and comes across the torn up cheque. He is heaps angry that they team didn't realise the link to the girl - well if they didn't why were they at the house? Following Bruce? I think not because how did he get out of there without being followed. Anyways, minor really but just made me think wtf.Otherwise a little oddball movie with some dark humour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best spy film of 2010</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the first trailer of RED was released there was buzz and anticipation that going to be a fun action comedy. Loosely based on a graphic novel by Warren Ellis, RED delivers and shows that other action heroes still got it.Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), is a retired black-ops CIA agent who is struggling to adjust to civilian and spends his time telephone Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), a woman who works for the pensions services. But Frank has been tags RED, Retired, Extremely Dangerous and a target for assassination. He goes on the run, going to Kansas City to protect Sarah and reuniting with his out team, Joe (Morgan Freeman), Marvin (John Malkovich) and Victoria (Helen Mirren). They set out to find out why the CIA want them dead, with a young, ambitious and talented agent William Cooper (Karl Urban) leading the hunt.RED is far from a perfect film, there are some holes, but it an entertaining film, providing action and comedy in equal measure. With a fun script director Robert Schwentke was able to give us visual comedy, but it is the verbal comedy and performers that is the real strength, with Parker and Malkovich delivering the most (how can anyone not love Mary-Louise Parker?). The first fight scene was a over-edited, but the rest of the action is well handled, like the scene in the cargo yard with explosive devices landing on people's heads. It would have been nice if the action was a little more violence but there are plenty of gun battles to satifity the audience. The basic plot is a Macguffin, an excuse for action sequences, there is still enough of focus and story was simple. Weirdly whilst RED is a comedy and light-hearted in it's approach with some holes (like how do Frank and Sarah travel across America so quickly), it is more believable then say a film like Salt, because there is a lack of technology, that the actions are resourceful and they is a simple focus.There is an excellent cast in the film. As mentioned Parker and Malkovich were stand out performers, with Parker being a excellent comic performer (and well, one hell of MILF), she has just has natural comic timing and believable. It was fun that Malkovich plays a paranoid man, playing his is follow and well, turns out to be right. One of the themes is that Willis and Parker play lonely characters who are looking for companionship and do it well, playing a convincing couple, with Willis being a little like his character in Twelve Monkeys early in the film. Willis is a convincing action hero and I do like to see older actors kick butt. Freeman is such a strong film present that he can read the phone book and give a great performer whilst there is nothing sexier then Helen Mirren with a large gun. One of the best feature in character development is making William Cooper out to be a man doing his job and that he has a nice home life with his young children; a man who thinks he is doing the right thing and someone is not evil or bad, he is a real shade of grey. Urban is a good actor and I hope to see more from him. But Richard Dreyfuss basically plays his character like he was Dick Cleney, and whilst I do enjoy a Cleney bashing, the character was one-dimensional and false, totally underdeveloped. And whilst I like Brain Cox, his gives a poor caricatures of a Russian man and a bad Russian accent; it would have been better to cast an Eastern European actor.But overall an fast paced adventure and a good way to spend two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its been 22 years since Die Hard launched Bruce Willis' career. He has had a roller coaster of ups and downs since then. I consider his movie Cop Out, which came out earlier this year, as a major down! Here he is back on top in this very exciting and enjoyable thriller. He plays a burnt out former CIA agent who is so bored with retirement that he conducts a long distance phone romance with a government secretary (Mary Louise Parker in a delightful, show stealing performance). I really felt bad for Bruce's character. He was the best the CIA had and yet his character just yearned for love and a simpler life. John Malkovich should get a "ham of the year award" for his performance as Willis' crazed CIA buddy. I love the part when he blows that woman away after she calls him "old man". The always great Morgan Freeman is also on hand and brings his usual dignity and class to his role, my only complaint is that he didn't have enough screen time. I also enjoyed Helen Mirran's performance as well. She is best known for Shakespeare and classic roles. I assume that she had a ball making this film. She is hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's nothing new for a film to be based on a comic book. With Marvel now having its own studio and Christopher Nolan unable to finish an interview without talk of Batman, I think it is fair to say that we are a society inundated with comics. These films have a pretty developed audience of young fanboys. Red is a comic book film for a different audience. The film is without a doubt enjoyable and features an incredible cast, but it is a comic book film made for those in cardigans not vintage tees.Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), a former black-ops CIA agent, is having a rough time adjusting to retirement. In his life of boredom, he begins a phone relationship with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), a customer service agent working for his pension office. One night Frank's old life intrudes into his new one as a hit squad descends on his house. After disposing of his would-be killers, he heads to Kansas City to protect Sarah. In order to better assess and deal with his risk of death, Frank decides to get his black-ops team back together. With the help of his old friends, Frank has to figure out who wants him dead and why, all while avoiding CIA agent Cooper (Karl Urban) who is hot on his tails.In my hometown, there is a small art theater. I always knew of the theater and that it played smaller films that often were looked over by the larger multiplexes, but even after having a bit of a film awakening in my freshman year of college I never took the leap and bought a ticket. That was until two months ago when I plunged into the place I had always eyed skeptically from afar. As I ventured in, I was smacked in the face by the smell of mothballs. I told my nose to relax and pushed forward. My way was now blocked by a group of ladies, bearing a striking similarity to the Golden Girls, on an afternoon out. While walking down the aisle of the theater I noticed that I was being stared down. Eyes from all around locked onto me until I had settled into my seat. The reason: my age. I was easily 35 years younger than every other member of the audience. It was an odd feeling to say the least, a completely unique film-going experience. Nevertheless, it did open my eyes a bit. Previously I had a caricature of the elderly constantly pooh-poohing the films of today. "I miss the real movie stars" "everything is just so loud" "what's with all the colors", the voices would sing in my head. But wait there are actually older folks that still enjoy going to the films of today. Seeing Red bolstered this theory.I saw this film with my parents and during this time there was but one group that featured individuals younger than 20, the rest of the audience was above 40. It may have been this particular audience that so influenced my experience of the film. Putting that aside I will say that I liked the film, but not as much as the people surrounding me. I was shocked by the collective excitement expressed when Ernest Borgnine appeared on screen. In retrospect, this makes perfect sense. While Red is a comic book film with copious action, featuring gunfire, fistfights, car chases and explosions it is also a discussion of the nature of retirement. Willis' character misses his old life and is grasping for things to fill his now empty life of retirement. He is clearly unhappy and it isn't until his life is threatened that you really see the twinkle come back into his eyes. I can't understand retirement as a threat, so this aspect of the film is somewhat lost on me.The action is good but not anything special. There aren't really any moments that truly stand out as exceptional action set pieces. One gunfight does feature some pretty great bits from John Malkovich and huge explosions but nothing new. The story at times feels like an afterthought with some third act developments that are a bit forced. You will be entertained but that's all thanks to the cast.Oh, have I not mentioned the cast? Just writing the cast list is amazing. I don't know about you, but deep down I have always wanted to see Helen Mirren shoot a machine gun. Then you have Bruce Willis being Bruce Willis, John Malkovich adding some insane comedy and Morgan Freeman just kind of hanging out. It's nice to see Mirren and Malkovich so deftly handling the action since I can't remember another time that they have had the opportunity. I could gush over Mary-Louise Parker but I'm not sure how much is her being good and how much is my crush on her. Karl Urban kicks some ass too. If there is a weak member of the cast, I don't remember him.What if the cast of Cocoon used to be in the CIA? Now I don't know how many people have been asking that question, but Red seeks to answer it. With a mediocre story and generic action set pieces, the cast is the film's saving grace. Without this cast, the film would have sucked. Malkovich is all kinds of funny as the mentally unstable team member, and Mirren's comfort with automatic weapons will leave you wondering why she doesn't do this more often. Red may not be the topic of conversation come awards season but the cast makes sure that you get your money's worth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw Red and I was surprised how satisfying this movie really was. A well-crafted and slick action flick like this hasn't been made in a while. To see the brilliant John Malkovich as a paranoid and funny loon and Dame Helen Mirren taking her velvet gloves off and wielding heavy artillery, that is the price of admission alone. Bruce Willis is back in top form as a retired CIA operative, who still got the chops to kick mucho butt. Morgan Freeman, unfortunately, didn't have as much screen time as I would have hoped, but it was still a pleasure seeing him every time he appeared on screen. The rest of the cast, Mary-Louise Parker as the damsel in distress and love interest, Brian Cox as a Russian ally and Richard Dreyfuss and Karl Urban as the baddies, makes this movie worth every penny. If you like popcorn movies with interchangeable punches and punchlines and a throwback to 80s action flicks, this movie would be right up your alley!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently, I got out to see the new madcap, action/comedy Red, based on the graphic novel by Warren Ellis, and Cully Hammer.My advice: Don't go in expecting the greatest movie ever, but do expect to have a great time.In the film Bruce Willis plays Frank Moses, a man who is RED (Retired and Extremely Dangerous). Over a long period, he's had an over the phone relationship with a Kansas City receptionist named Sarah (Played by Mary Louise-Parker). After a rather intense invasion of his home by mysterious gunmen, he travels to Kansas City, and kidnaps Sarah, fearing that the people who want him dead, may also want to kill her, and also tries to always keep one foot ahead of a CIA agent named William Cooper (Played by Karl Urban). He seeks help from old, and equally dangerous friends such as Cancer-stricken, but intelligent Joe Matheson (Played by the legendary Morgan Freeman), excessively paranoid stealth-man Marvin Boggs (Played by John Malkovich), and caring, but fiery assassin Victoria (Played by Helen Mirren).This film really is, in every way, a mindlessly fun popcorn flick, filled to the brim with laughs, and reckless action sequences, kind of in the same category as Roland Emmerich's Independence Day, minus the aliens, and on a considerably smaller scale. The movie may present a bit of elements that has been seen in a number of films, but its stylistic approach, and clever wit is what makes it better than most of those.Aside from a great cast I've mentioned earlier, it also includes appearances by other legends like Ernest Borgnine, Brian Cox, and Richard Dreyfuss. The main cast is really what makes it so great, such as Bruce Willis, who's definitely still got what it takes as an action star. Mary Louise-Parker could have been great, but as it goes, she's rather good. Helen Mirren is very effective in somewhat short screen time, as is Morgan Freeman, albeit to a fairly lesser extent. But the true standout is John Malkovich, whose character is so fun, so bizarre, and utterly, and hilariously paranoid (Often for nothing but good reasons).It's oh-so enjoyable, reckless, witty, and brimming with action. The cast specifically get a lot of laughs......enough for me to give Red *** out of ****</fullReview>

Period. If you found this witless excrescence funny or endearing or entertaining, it ipso facto is proof that you are a moron and have no taste, and all your opinions are worthless. You may have done well on your SATs; you may have graduated from a top college and done splendidly at grad school. You may be successful at an extremely demanding job. You may be good at crossword puzzles; you may have solved Rubik's Cube. "Red" made you chuckle? You got a kick out of Bruce Willis, and Malkovich, and Parker, and Freeman?

		<shortDescription>Really Excruciatingly Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>http://thewildbore.blogspot.com/2010/10/red.html Twitter: LG45Bruce Willis heads up an interesting cast in this comic book adaptation about a group of retired CIA agents who are wanted by ... the CIA. Is it time to put this in a home and leave it to die? Short answer - yes.Director Robert Schwentke has had a very strange career up to this film. His real break into Hollywood was directing Jodie Foster in the massively average Flightplan and then the ludicrously disgusting The Time Traveller's Wife (which was poorer than the book, if you can imagine such a thing) and now from thriller (if you can call Flightplan a thriller), to drama, to comic book action. I've not seen his first German feature Tattoo which is supposed to be a slightly gory horror neither his follow-up comedy The Family Jewels, but either Schwentke doesn't want to be pigeon-holed, or he can't settle on a genre, or maybe he just doesn't really know what he is any good at. Well let's just say, it ain't this.Bruce Willis is in retirement getting his kicks by borderline stalking a young woman who is in charge of sending him his cheques (I say young, it's actually played by Weeds Mary-Louise Parker who is actually 46 and looks amazing for it), some agents try and kill him and so he goes on a quest to find out why. The actual plot is ridiculous, I still don't really get the whole picture, something about a cover-up of some mission that has something to do with the Vice President, it's all complete nonsense and the way the characters are introduced is completely lame. Bruce Willis is actually good as his usual cocky yet genuine action hero who oozes charisma, he has aged remarkably well and Parker does a good job as the fish-out-of-water act, in fact you could say the whole film is just her fantasy what with her obsession with romantic pulp novels.In terms of the rest of the cast, Helen Mirren as a posh British assassin is boring and completely vanilla, the only time she stands out is shooting a massive gun at some cars in an end sequence that is the most long-winded and stupid way of trying to kidnap the Vice President. Who came up with this plan? These guys were CIA? Morgan Freeman who I think could possibly be one of the most overrated black actors ever, apart from maybe Denzel Washington, is a lame duck and the last time we see him can't come soon enough in a rather forgettable fashion. No-one talks about him afterwards thank God. Richard Dreyfuss is some kind of rich businessman behind it all or something, I don't know because I stopped paying attention, but the only real interesting characters were John Malkovich's paranoid schizo (originally to be played by John C Reilly - which would have been terrible), Brian Cox as a suave Russian ex-spy and Karl Urban as the young agent trying to chase them down. Clearly the whole cast had fun shooting the whole thing and this comes across as you watch the movie, but it's a complete disappointment.The action is okay with the best bits in the trailer and they've tried to flesh out the characters a bit but it doesn't work, instead I thought it was a 'shoot-now-ask-questions-later' scenario where they were never really taking anything seriously. So the novelty of old killers is fun for about 45 minutes, but after that it's hard to keep interested. What with such terrible comic adaptations sprouting up where studios are trying to cash in on the comic buck as soon as possible rather than letting a script evolve for a while, you get fodder like The Losers and remakes of films only recently been made (Hulk/Spiderman/Superman) and unfortunately films like Red.Retired Extremely Dangerous? More like Really Excruciatingly Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all i wanted to say that this movie is thrilling and fascinating ! i didn't see it on the big screen but i watched it late at night on TV , it was 2 in the morning and i said to myself i will watch just the beginning and then go to sleep, but i couldn't resist , i watched the entire movie and i said to myself , why didn't i see it earlier ? The movie is about a retired CIA agent(Frank Moses),after his retirement someone gives orders to kill him , unfortunately for all the guys who come to shoot him he still got it all , the fighting scenes are cool and amusing , he is a cold blooded killer and does his job silently , even when they kidnap his "future girlfriend" he still plays it cool. What makes the movie even greater is him bonding back and reuniting his old unit of super good murderers ! Frank's character has it all and there is nothing wrong or missing in it , but i wanted to point out some weak points in the movie : 1.Joe Matheson in mentioned as the man that never dies , why does he die in the movie in a fast and unemotional way ? 2.how come the vise president dies under a bridge in the middle of the city and no one pays attention ? 3.How come sarah started liking this job so suddenly ? she was so freaked out in the beginning ? but in conclusion the movie is great and i recommend it , Bruce willis gets cooler and cooler as he gets older and older</fullReview>

But despite their age they played cool actions scenes. Except freeman, he is here for his epicness and his catch phrases, but lets be honest he never really played action guy in any movie, it is not his type.

		<shortDescription>Great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well it was an interesting idea, I'll give them that. Get some older actors together and put them in an action movie that has them kicking ass and taking names against people half their age. It's not everyday that you get to see Bruce Willis teaming up with Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich to solve a government conspiracy and clear their names in the process.In this somewhat confusing plot, we see Bruce Willis taking the star role as Frank Moses, a retired CIA agent who spends his days looking forward to his daily phone conversations with his pension administrator Sarah (Mary Louise-Parker). It isn't long until his idyllic life is uprooted when a hit squad is sent to his house with orders to take him out. Apparently Frank is one of many who are on a hit list. Why is Frank on this hit list? It has something to do with a government cover up from the 1980's and apparently Frank is one of the loose ends.Realizing he's going to need some help if he is to survive, he goes to his former associates. Joe (Morgan Freeman), Marv (John Malkovich) and Victoria (Helen Mirren) join Frank and together, this team of Red (Retired and Extremely Dangerous) CIA operatives try to figure out just what the heck is going on. Along the way, Sarah also gets pulled into the shenanigans and the team sets out to expose the conspiracy at hand.The story is a bit messy at times and as the film goes on, it seems as if the filmmakers were less concerned with preserving the fluidity and logic of it all and more concerned with keeping the action up to par. The story goes from somewhat acceptable to just plain ridiculous and by the end, rather than trying to remember the details of it all, you'd rather just forget. It's just one big incoherent mess that descends into nonsense rather quickly.It's not original in the slightest and I'm not going to try and pretend otherwise. Red has a fairly familiar story. In fact, at times it feels all too predictable. What will ultimately draw you into Red isn't the plot, rather it's the chemistry between the actors and the somewhat entertaining action that may leave you mildly pleased as the end credits roll.All the action is shot pretty well and the humor is mixed in nicely. Director Robert Schwentke pulls off the stylized violence acceptably but it really isn't anything we haven't already seen earlier this year in The Losers or in previous years with Wanted or even Watchmen.www.felmogaz.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Past never really escapes you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually wonder whether there is actually anything really deep and meaningful in this movie, but even though there may not be, this was still an enjoyable action movie with a number of stars which could be considered to be coming to the end of their acting careers. I have noticed that there are a few of these movies coming out, the other one that came to mind was The Expendibles, but whereas the later reminded me a lot of the A-Team this movie seems to stand out on its own.RED, an acronym for Retired, Extremely Dangerous, is about a group of ex-CIA agents who have retired and are now living on government pensions. However, their past has never quite got away from them as it has come to light that one of their missions has become an embarrassment to one of the US officials, and he has decided that he wants to erase all memory of this event, so he has ordered a hit on everybody that was involved.The problem is that it is not all that easy to get rid of a bunch of ex-CIA killers, and the more one tries the more it comes back to bite them. Therefore if there is one thing that does come out of this movie it is about how our past never always stays in the past, and in many cases it will always be there to haunt us. This is something that is true with myself because I know that in the past I was a real wild child, yet for some reason, while I got myself into trouble, it was not necessarily trouble that will haunt me, and though I know people that still remember that past, many of them have long gone.This is where God comes into it. If there is one thing that I desire about my past, and this is to have forgiveness for what I have done. I know that there is no way to erase it, and like the events in RED, if we do attempt to go out and erase it, then it is only going to create more problems for us. Indeed it is when we try to deal with the past ourselves that past really begins to invade the present, however with God, while the past is still there, and while it will still haunt you, it is comforting to know that the forgiveness that God offers you enables you to continue to go forward knowing that in God's eyes, the past has been cleaned and we know the comfort that forgiveness brings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red Can Be Fun To Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red is an action comedy film that was inspired by the limited comic book series of the same title created by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner.It was published by the DC Comics imprint Homage. The film stars Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Mary-Louise Parker, Helen Mirren, and Karl Urban.It was directed by Robert Schwentke and the screenplay was written by Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber.Frank Moses used to be a hired gun for the CIA. Along with Joe,Marvin, and Victoria, Frank's specialty was carrying out contracts that the government didn't want the public to know about. These days, Frank and his old gang are all retired, but the powers that be are still concerned that they know too much, and dispatch a team of top assassins to ensure their silence. Now, Frank and his former team members realize that their only hope for survival is to break into CIA headquarters and expose the truth. But once they're in, the group uncovers evidence of a massive cover-up that promises to rock the very foundation of our government. The film may not be the great action entertainment ride you'd expect from an action movie with a cast of this caliber, but Red still thoroughly outshines most of its big budget counterparts with its wit and style.The best reason to get out there and see it is to see these actors take on this kind of over-the-top material. The fun they appear to be having on screen ends up being quite contagious to the viewer.</fullReview>

And a really nice surprise to see the like of Brian Cox and Mary Louise Parker. The main cop on the case did a great job (Urban?) and always nice to see the legendary Ernest Borgnine, I don't believe he's still in movies. How many of those guys are left that are still making appearances in movies? Martin Landau comes to mind. I'll probably send this review and then think of two or three more, but how many are still doing films? Bornine must be 90 years old by now. If you haven't seen RED yet, you should. It is obviously not realistic, like any movie with action, but hello! it's a movie, and a very enjoyable one at that. Great cast. Great supporting cast. A fun movie overall. It'll be a great rental. Don't know if there's room for a sequel, they'd need to bring in one or two additional 'pros' to make it work. Hopefully they'll leave well enough alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend of mine at work had to actually entice me to see Red. And I'm sorry I needed such persuasion to see it, finally.I mean, I love Bruce Willis in an smart action role (SEE: Die Hard or Live Free or Die Hard,) I love Morgan Freeman in anything, even bad films and most of all, I love Helen Mirren?especially when she holds a gun a third of her weight without a blink.So why did it take me this long? No excuse. I just had so many other movies to see. Now, you shouldn't have an excuse, because Red was just simple "leave your brain at the door" fun.You can't take a movie like this seriously. It's close to the aspect of 2010's The A-Team, whereas you'll try and rekindle the past while knowing: nothing you see is possible. And that's part of the fun.Ex-CIA agent Frank (Bruce Willis) is wooing a call-center gal, Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) when he's targeted for assassination?but wait! This is the Bruce Willis you know and love! (If you don't: press stop now. In fact, why the hell did you rent this anyways, if you're not a "die hard" Willis fan?) He won't let anyone take him down, not even his love (lust) interest, Sarah.So, he rescues her while hired assassin, William (Karl Urban) begins his quest for annihilation of Frank and his soon-to-be crew of retirees: Marvin (a wonderful John Malkovich,) Joe (Morgan Freeman) and Victoria (Helen Mirren.) Not to mention the -gasp- Russian spy Ivan (Brian Cox.)Pretty much the rest of the movie pans out as they're trying to survive ? with little help, oh! I love super-human characters in fictional stories ? while solving the puzzle of who's trying to kill them and not allowing them to stay retired. And alive.Here's the deal. Yeah, it's unrealistic, I get that. It's a movie produced by the DC Comics crowd, for goodness sakes. But, the weak spot is Mary-Louise Parker's Sarah and her barely unflinching willingness to go along for the ride. She all but almost dismantled the crew or my desire to further watch.Skip over her. I beg you. This is an extremely fun, no-brainer film with actual shocks, twists and even a sadness when one character dies. I highly recommend it, but make sure you leave that deep-thought cap off when you press play. Again, that is, once you realize you are, in fact, a closeted Willis fan.</fullReview>

He delivers some stellar acting and not for one moment did I feel that he was over selling his character. Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren don't get too much screen time and they feel under-used considering they are two of the best to ever grace the screen.The movie kicks off slowly but soon turns into a high paced scenario where the 4 plus Mary Louis Parker are running to save their neck and of others. At the end of the day, it feels like Bruce Willis might finally put his Die Hard days behind him, but who knows? Maybe like Sylvester Stallone, he maybe back again ;)</fullReview>

I came to expect her in other more active roles, so it was funny seeing her being more passive this time around.Willis is laconic as ever, but he gets out-shined (as do the others) by John Malkovich. He is just great. The movie of course is not to be taken too seriously. It always delivers its dialog with a smirk and a wink.

Frank was living his life peacefully before CIA attempt to kill him and here comes the evil... Frank start fighting with CIA to get to know the source who ordered to kill him...A great movie for action lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie was Amazing!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Movie is by far the best movie of the year it made me laugh so hard its hilarious. The Acting was fantastic as always and some of the scene were amazing like when Bruce Willis just walked out of a spinning car or at the start of the movie when he put the bullets in the pan that whole scene was amazing. and some of the ideas like "the Pig" or "Retired and Extremely Dangerous" were amazing, the scrip was well written and it was just plain fun to name all the guns as you go along (which there were plenty off) Bruce Willis and Morgan freeman in the same movie? oh my god the best narrator in the world and the best counter terrorist in the world this movie is a must see get your kids of that couch and drag them to this movie they will love you forever after they see it this movie deserves every single type of award known to man. Dare I say it this movie is equivalent to the Hangover. 10/10 guys great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very entertaining film from start to finish with several good plot twists to keep viewers guessing, mostly light hearted and well acted by the entire cast with good interaction between the established stars and lesser known newcomers. Action sequences were well performed and directed in the typical Bruce cheeky grin way, John Malkovitch is wonderfully crazy and has the best bite me moment when he takes out a rocket propelled grenade with 1 shot from his enormous handgun. Morgan Freeman breezed through his part and remains as smooth as ever, his expression was spot on when he asked his nurse to adjust the TV set picture (she had to bend over) he wasn't interested in the TV picture at all, wink wink. The ever-so versatile Brian Cox played an amusing Russian diplomat who knew everything about everything and impressed me once again with his wicked side. I enjoyed every moment and will enjoy watching it again when it is released on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie to watch if you are looking for good fun and entertainment. The cast is probably one of the best seen lately for an action movie and every one of them has a moment to shine on screen. Its true Bruce Willis is acting like himself in other movies but he has charisma and knows how to do his work. Morgan Freeman rocks no matter what he does and John Malkovich he really stole the show and had the most hilarious lines of the whole movie. When you see a movie that doesn't take itself seriously but its still manages to make you laugh and be excited about what is happening you know that you are getting exactly what you paid for. Definitely worth a watch and hopefully they continue bringing good action comedies like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MUCH better than Jonah Hex!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the the well deserved backlash against steaming pile "Jonah Hex" RED beats it hands down in everything moviegoers look for: Character development, story, plot twists, action, and of course dark, witty humor sprinkled evenly out in all the right places. True, it's not Oscar material but it succeeds in it's goal of being just a good movie; something Jonah Hex failed at immeasurably. While Jonah Hex was filled with camp and disjointed scenes at characterization of it's main players, RED gives it's characters plenty of screen time to give the audience insight into their pasts, feelings, warmth and charm, making them more than 2 dimensional and you really feel for the characters as they set out to save their hides from a secret and deadly conspiracy.I like this movie. A lot. With a witty and funny script and some truly awesome set pieces and plot, RED is one of the best comic book movies to put Jonah Hex and it's ilk to shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Expendables for old character actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RED is a big ensemble action movie, and thus must be compared to the recent The Expendables. RED is better. But it is by no means a perfect movie either.Like The Expendables, your enjoyment of RED depends largely of how much you get a kick out of the actors on screen. And I for one love more old, crazy character actors than wrestlers and other muscle stars, even though I love 80's action films with all my heart. In addition to leading Bruce Willis, you'll get John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, Morgan Freeman, and a couple of smaller parts I don't care to reveal yet, even though they are found on the cast list. And all these actors seem to have a genuinely good time - for once they get to shoot guns instead of doing boring drama. Except for Bruce who has a boring romantic subplot - that at least happens among all the action and not bizarrelly stopping it a'la The E-movie. Without the cast, or even with just Bruce, the film would be sort of a lacklustre spy thriller, even if it has a few truly kick-ass sequences (most of them are found in the trailer). But Malkovich and Cox in particular always bring a smile to my face, even with some lesser material.One thing that really bugged me about this film was the use of music. It was way too generic and comedic and always too loud. I get that RED is supposed to be an action comedy, but the makers should take a page from the ZAZ filmmaking: Everything is much funnier when done with a straight face. Without the wink wink -attitude this could've been an even greater action film. But I still enjoyed it a lot.*** / ***** http://fastmovieblog.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Red is an enjoyable, fun movie. It has some good action scenes, nice humor and good interaction between characters. The story is kind of absurd, but that doesn't get in the way. Bruce Willis is really good, but my favorite character was the one played by John Malkovich. The Morgan Freeman character was just so-so. The PG-13 rating is accurate. I would not recommend anyone under 13 seeing this. No sex, a few swears, lots of shooting and explosions.Overall, if you are looking for a fun movie with a few twists, good action and nice wordplay between the characters, this is for you. I recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over the years, people would expect having a big experience and feel of being at the movies. Many other epic action blockbusters such as Avatar, The Dark Knight, Terminator 2 and Inception have all succeeded of being all spectacular and of course memorable that people appreciate for the experience of the movie. The movie 'Red' starring Bruce Willis, has the same kind of formula that people would appreciate seeing during their trip to the movies.Although it acts and starts slow with audiences losing interest, during five minutes of the movie. It rises up with something new and something that would amaze anyone. The explosive action is chaos, The jokes are hysterical, The actors will grab you and never let you go.Whatever you do in 2010, you have to see 'Red' in theaters. You really don't want to miss out on the laughs and clapping the audience and i have had.Thrilling, Fast and Dazzles with Style. 'Red' is an all-around audience winner. DO IT NOW!!</fullReview>

Frank Moses (Willis) was one of the top agents of the CIA, but has long since retired and put the old life behind him. Unfortunately the past comes back to haunt him when he unexpectedly becomes the target of lethal black-ops agents who've made it their mission to eliminate him. In a race against time, with his deadly adversaries in hot pursuit, he reunites his old team (Freeman, Mirren, Malkovich) in an effort to uncover the conspiracy. A few longueurs and some familiar plotting, but it's hard to miss with this cast, these energetic action scenes, and so many laughs. Parker seems out of place, but Malkovich has more fun than anyone as the cunning, yet extremely paranoid member of the group. **?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RED (2010) ***1/2 Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Mary Louise-Parker, Keith Urban, Richard Dreyfuss, Brian Cox, Rebecca Pidgeon, Ernest Borgnine. Highly entertaining actioner based on the graphic novel of Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner ? a serviceable adaptation by scribes Jon &amp; Erich Hoeber and quick and loose direction by Robert Schwentke ? with Willis (dry-as-a-Saltine-cool-as-a-cucumber having a field day) as an RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous) ex black ops agent facing down his former employers (i.e. the good ol' US gov't) out to retire him ? permanently. "Getting the band back together" with colleagues in vengeance and cleaning up messes including wily Freeman, wetworks specialist Mirren (!) ?suggesting Martha Stewart gone wild ? and best, for last, loony-toon conspiracy theorist/weapons expert Malkovich (also have a giddy time letting his ya-yas out). Parker is acridly funny as Willis' would-be new flame (a meet cute on the phone as his pension check rep) and Cox too as a Russkie compadre. Some great sequences and a lot of bang for the buck; a guilty pleasure for all to have.</fullReview>

While doing this, his life and home is attacked by agents from another government. He survives. then he contacts some other R.E.D. agents to find out why he is now the subject of several government hit squads. This R.E.D. elderly group goes on the offensive solve the question and to get justice. It leads them to an operation in South American years before and the dealings of the Vice President of the USA.*Special Stars- Bruce Willis, Karl Urban, Morgan Freedman, Mary-Louise Parker, Helen Mirren, Richard Dreyfuss, Brian Cox, John Malkovich, Ernest Borgnine.*Theme- Covert ops are seldom clean and easy functions of government.*Trivia/location/goofs- Canadian, Tornoto. R.E.D.- Stands for Retired, extremely dangerous. Frank Moses' birth date in the dossier is revealed as 19 March 1955, which is Bruce Willis' real birth date. When Colonel Moses is challenged by armed guards, they give him a hand salute. Armed guards in the performance of their duty would not lower their weapons to hand salute anyone. When Sarah Ross is holding the candle-holder, the last candle itself appears and disappears between shots. Also, its position changes.*Emotion- A highly well acted, tight and good paced spy plot with a huge all star cast. The action and traveling all over the USA makes this film highly enjoyable. THe plot seems like a cross between a quirky Quentin Tarentino and a Bond film.*Based on- CIA books of the day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know this idea had to come along at some point. Take the basic action premise of various spy flicks like Bond 'Mission: Impossible' and 'True Lies', then make the main characters retired old agents, super spy pensioners.The plot is pretty much like any other flick in this genre, corruption that leads all the way up to the top, assassinations, intrigue and cover ups. Its Bruce Willis and his ex-team members who have been targeted by the CIA for termination due to previous unearthed information. So its up to them to get to the bottom of the it and uncover...errr the cover up.The film is yet another comic book adaptation of another comic I've never heard of so I can't compare. A lavish cast from top to bottom because its a big Hollywood production, thusly the visuals and action are also lavish as hell. Now whether or not this is a good thing I'm not sure, I don't know how accurate this is to the comic book firstly and secondly I think it can take away from the whole experience because its too 'Hollywood-ish.'There's nothing wrong with a glossy action thriller but they do tend to look the same. You don't really feel invested in the story because its all so neat, clean and shiny, there's no grit, no real sense of danger, all the cast are dolled up in layers of obvious makeup (Mirren) and you know no one of any real importance is gonna die and if they do chances are they will come back in the sequel.That being said I can't deny this film is a reasonably fun ride with semi decent action sequences that all do look quite comic book-esque. The sharp visuals do give it a certain bold colourful style that comes across as quirky but with some dark undertones. I do like how the film is violent to a degree, its not a blood bath but you do see bullet hits, injuries and plenty of death...yet it seems to get tamer towards the end methinks. My best description would be akin to 'Kick-Ass' but not as violent and without the profanity. It is quite fun to see older action heroes taking out elite hit squads, the sight of Helen Mirren using a massive tripod mounted anti tank machine gun in a ball gown was quite funny.It is all very predictable to be honest, this ain't no Bourne plot folks, did you really think Willis would lose his damsel in distress?. Some good action sequences, amusing dialog mainly coming from Malkovich who was the best character by far and a really good fight between Urban and Willis amazingly. The very end sequence unfortunately is too daft and comes across more like a Monty Python moment rather than a top action flick. For people like myself who don't know anything about the comic book the hook is old folk as super spies which is admittedly fun, apart from that its basically business as usual with nothing too ground breaking going on.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes no sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a pointless waste of money and talent this film is! According to Box Office Mojo it was budgeted at $58M, grossed $90M domestically and yielded a successful sequel. This is evidence of the vapid taste of the today's moviegoer.The picture is intended to be a comedy and also an action adventure. But the screenwriters have failed to understand the distinct requirements of these two genres. A comic scene does not require realism; surreal comedy is fine. Action, on the other hand, works only when there is a strict internal logic to support genuine menace. The action here does not respect any internal consistency. It ranges from serious to absurd for no apparent reason. The result is that the audience cannot feel a sense of danger at any point.What is worse, the ideas and events here are very serious. The story eventually arrives at a US Vice President who was once a blood soaked black ops killer, and who during the film orders the death of a dozen or more innocent people to cover up his past. Yet this is played for laughs. Comedy should have some meaning even if just poking fun at things that don't make sense; it should ultimately be a sincere comment if it is to be honest art. What possible comment is this script making?The comic book that the film is loosely based on certainly makes a real comment. There is no joking around in the comic. It tells the story of a retired CIA assassin who is disgusted by the new generation's lack of stomach for the awful things that sometimes must be done in the interest of the nation. How this evolved into the aimless farce on screen I do not know.Somehow a fantastic cast was rounded up and put into the service of realizing this script, and I suppose that the audience showed up to see those famous names. Malkovich's Marvin delivered the funniest moments. But I wish all of them had found a better project to attach themselves to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruce Willis's Bald Pate Juxtaposed With Some Action Shots.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a follower of Robert Schwentke since The Family Jewels; he was considered the German Spielberg however many times it would be fair to say that Spielberg is the American's Schwentke. As a director but also as writer or producer, he was able to create very entertaining movies with far modest budgets than Spielberg and not relaying on digital effects but well defined characters and awesome physical talents. Just look at the outstanding "Flightplan" or "The Kite Runner" where the you love this two cold blooded assassins perhaps because they are imperfectly humans or incredible stunts in "DISCTRICT 13 or Banlieue 13"; a movie able to make you hold your breath more than once. Pierre Morel does not have such a resume, however he directed "BANLIEUE 13" and "TAKEN" two very successful movies. TAKEN made almost 200 millions in USA and DISCTRICT 13 should had do something similar but never got a wide release perhaps because Hollywood cannot make this movies that involves risk for stunts and actors. In any case these two movies has a simple but effective character development that RED lacks.The fact that Bruce Willis was on board, makes me feel that something is not right or true here. Nobody is better than Willis creating the bad guys or the very good guys. He might be needing money, but for a star like him is better to get involved in a lame comedy where he can outshine the rest than in an action thriller interpreting a not likable psycho (who is the good guy). He got far more on his bad guy in PELHAM 123 which was a worse movie. As happened before; I believe that Hollywood re-cut and re-edit the movie to make it as shallow as American public will digest and took over creative control over the German team at least in the version shown in USA. Or they were making a violent video game where the only important thing is to kill and kill. There is no other explanation on a film that asks us to accept a psycho and a person betraying his own boss (and democracy) as heroes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do have no idea this film is another adaption from a comic series, Retired Extremely Dangerous, a group of retired special agents vs. a wipe-out scheme. It is highly tantalizing for me to see Dame Helen Mirren shooting machine guns in her blonde hair, maybe the trailer should take the blame as it is a bit misleading, the film turns out to be just another plain comedy with a little piece of action, which is far from meeting my satisfaction, I don't regret to watch the film, but after a second afterthought, the film is too mediocre with many details worth deeper excavating.The cast is my primary reason to watch the film, however, nothing is pleasantly surprised, John Malkovich is as insane as a scene stealer (whose role is to offer comic elements), Bruce Willis is the only action star, who had undertaken the sole close combat with Karl Urban in the middle of the film. The loving couple Helen Mirren and Brian Cox serve as sidekicks alone, poor Mary-Louise Parker gave a safe performance which barely suits her character as the love interest of Bruce. The villain Richard Dreyfuss looks like an older version of Leonard in THE BIG BANG THEORY. As for Morgan Freeman, he was hardly there in the film. The film was nominated for the Best Comedy/Musical Film in the Golden Globe this year, which had ironically proved how ridiculous the Golden Globe could be, even the notorious BURLESQUE and THE TOURIST (2010) also got the nominations in the same category. I must say it is a major flaw to lose its creditability. Given the fact I don't think highly of this film, I do appreciate the idea of the retired fighting back to get their pride and save the world. Maybe a possible sequel will have some improvement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walking into Red, I had high hopes. I was excited to see a movie with an older cast full of some of my?and also my parents'?favorites. Bruce Willis is Frank Moses, a retired CIA agent who is trying to uncover a very high-tech and somewhat unoriginal government conspiracy theory. He hunts down his old pals that he fought with in his "glory days." The crew includes old chipper Morgan Freeman as Joe, paranoid John Malkovich as Boggs, and the glamorous "goddess," Helen Mirren. Some of the higher points of the film were Bruce and Karl Urban's bloody fistfight in the middle of the CIA headquarters, Helen Mirren's gun-obsessed character, Victoria, and Malkovich's crazy persona, which fits perfectly into a stereotypical retired government secret agent. One of the downers was the unnecessary character of Mary Louise-Parker. Really? Why did these filmmakers stick a skanky (sorry for the language, Ms. Platter), young damsel-in-distress in the midst of an intense action flick? She seemed out of place, especially since she is young enough to be Bruce Willis' daughter. The make-out scene at the end was way too much to handle. This detail proved to be one of the deciding factors of the film, which disappointed me even more. The plot revolved around the track down of the people on the VP's hit list, and less about the development of the plan to take out the vice president himself. It was no 24, but I still expected Jack Bauer to pop out of one of those shiny black Escalades any minute, carrying a grenade launcher. I guess Bauer wasn't old enough to land a part in this movie. Overall I'll give this film a solid 6.5/10 for the excellent acting, but brought down by unnecessary characters and a clipped screenplay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no idea what this movie was about and hadn't actually heard about it before my friend suggested that I saw it, so I did. And truth be told, then I was left with a somewhat empty feeling.Alright, well the movie is not a bad movie, far from it. There was a lot of really nice action scenes and they were spiced with just enough comedy to make it interesting. I was especially amused by the grenade launcher scene and the "grenade baseball" scene, those were just priceless. And also seeing Helen Mirren with a huge caliber machine gun like that, that was just beyond your wildest imagination. This is where the comedy kicked in and it worked well.As for the cast and their acting. Well, blow me away and shiver me timbers; this movie was packed with huge names and lots of amazing talents. But honestly, I didn't think Bruce Willis carried this movie, and it was somewhat a reminiscent of "Cop Out" to watch him in this movie, which kind of brought the enjoyment of the movie down a notch for me. But Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren they carried this movie and they put on amazing performances in their roles. The roles played by Karl Urban was also good, though I am not much of a fan of his, but he still did a good job in this movie.What didn't work in this movie, besides Bruce Willis, was the story. It was a bit weak and didn't have enough punch to come through with the impact that it needed. For me, it was a relatively empty excitement I got out of the movie, and I was sitting at the end of the movie thinking "why? was this movie really necessary to have been made?" But hey, we are all different individuals and have different likes and dislikes. And I am sure that lots of people out there will find "Red" to be quite a kick, and go for it guys.Yet again I think about the grenade launcher and "grenade baseball" scenes, they were by far the most memorable throughout the entire movie.For an evening of action where you don't have to put your mind to much work, the movie "Red" might be a good choice to go with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this film is excellent. I am not a big time movie goer, who looks for certain things in a movie to determine if it legitimately is a great movie, like a Roger Ebert. I am just an average joe who loves a great movie, and this is it! Frank Moses, played by Bruce Willis, is a retired-CIA agent. He has pretty darn good skills in fighting, and he will need those skills in this movie. He kept on calling Sarah Ross, played by Mary Louise Parker, who works at the CIA to be just a normal, everyday lady who replaces lost checks that did not get mailed to the retired agents. Bruce just wanted to talk to her all the time, because every time he called about a check he didn't receive, he had actually tore the check up. He's always had the hots for her, and she's quite a pretty lady, so he has great taste in women. So one day, he gets a visit from some guys who look like they wanna kill him, or at least do him some harm. He kills them with the special skills he has. He soon discovers that he's on a hit list of people the vice-president of the United States wants killed, because as a soldier, he wiped out a whole town of people in Guatamala years ago, and he wants people that were there DEAD DEAD DEAD! He doesn't want them telling any tales, because he's about to run for President of the United States. So Frank gets some of his fellow retired operatives to help him out. Boy, do they have a ball getting the goods on the V.P.! If only Cheney could have been taken down like the V.P. in this film!! Now, for those who have seen the movie, i am a bit confused about agent Cooper. When he called Moses' character "Grandpa", and actually helped Moses at the end, was it all planned like that all along? Were they really just pretending to take each other down, or did Cooper finally realize that the V.P. was really trying to get rid of Moses, along with the others on the hit list, and he knew that Moses was a good guy, and helped him out? The ending had a classic twist to it, if that is the case. It all came together quite nicely. A very great movie!! I plan on watching it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hype makes us think this is better than it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Schwentke has always been a favorite German director of mine. His films, including "Red," have a subtle yet captivating force. "Red" is not for the average film viewer, but is for more mature audiences who are not afraid to confront life as it is and the existential aspects of life in general. The film is an exploration of complex human conditions that people can often find boring. But "Red" is inarguably meaningful and deep in its own way. It presents life realistically, but also paves way for finding positive little things within the worst conditions. "Red" is a film that will make you think in a way that almost no Hollywood movie can. Certainly, it is a powerful film as well. The movie is fast paced and full of action, But somehow it is just average....The only problem is that the majority of the population can misunderstand a film such as this one. It is a film that requires effort on the part of the audience to think and interpret the film for what it is. But once the purpose of the film is appreciated, it is a wonderful film for what it's worth. Go and watch it. It's a film that can change the way you look at everyday things. It was a mystery to me what Bruce Willis was doing! It seems to me that he was used to attract viewers! Avoid this movie and go see "3 Idiots" (Bollywood's biggest box-office hit yet -- three friends at an engineering school who incur the wrath of a vindictive professor and have to use all their ingenuity to succeed.)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgetful wacky action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those wacky action movies that is also very forgetful. Yeah it did have it's moments and was fun at times, but almost everything in this movie has been done before and nothing really stood out much. I first read the comic book which this movie is loosely based on and wondered how they were going to make a movie out of a super short comic book. The answer is add more characters, more wacky action and comedy while the comic book is dark and gritty and add more story involving the conspiracy and such. And some stuff that wasn't answered in the comic book or left unanswered on purpose is shown in the movie. There is also barely any character development in this and the girl that Bruce Willis's character falls for is more annoying than funny or fun character to watch. Some critics liked heard in this, I personally didn't. Yes, the movie is wacky at times and it also tries to be funny, but it really isn't at all. The character interactions was okay and kinda enjoyable at times though and the action isn't that good but it's alright. So it's a passable wacky action movie just not a really good one.6.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets the comic tone just right to make it an enjoyable action movie with its tongue in its cheek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first heard about this film when Bruce Willis appeared on the Daily Show. The clip they used was the one where Willis steps out of the spinning police car and is narrowly missed by it as he calmly opens fire on his assailant. On the face of it the clip looked ridiculously overblown and the special effects used weren't great either and it didn't look real (which didn't help with it looking daft either). On the strength of this I wasn't fussed about seeing another film where obvious special effects make the impossible appear possible while the audience are left with nothing but spectacle. Despite this I wound up seeing it this weekend and have to admit that the clip does work in context even if it doesn't as a standalone.The difference is that the film gets the tone just right and makes it easy to enjoy by having its tongue in its cheek for most of the time. This is essential in a film where we are expected to believe that retired agents over 50 years old can still beat all challengers and pull off ridiculous feats such as shooting a missile in mid-flight with a pinpoint shot. I'm sure some will not get this humour and therefore the film will not work but for me I found myself quickly charmed by the good-humoured nature of it and I found it very easy to enjoy as it delivered solid action with a knowing wink. Plot-wise it is just as silly but again this is carried along by the fact that it is enjoyable and quite fun.The script is a big part of it and it hands the cast some nice banter which is a big part of the film being fun. They respond to it well, even if more could have been made of the age thing. Willis is a necessary evil but one that works. His wise-cracking personae and his ability to wryly undermine himself while also doing action means that he is perfect for this sort of film but the downside is that part of the "concept" is that the main characters are old and retired. Yes, Willis is old but at the same time we are used to seeing him be old and invincible in other films (where we are asked not to see this as an issue) so it is perhaps a jump to expect him to fit in as "old" here. He does work well with Parker though, who herself is good value as she "gets" what the film is doing. Malkovich is enjoyably manic while Mirren, Freeman and Borgnine are solid. I liked Urban's supporting turn.Overall Red is not a brilliant film, it is not something people will rave about for years to come. However what it does do it easily entertain. The action is solid but the comic tone is key and it gets this just right ? never being dumb but never taking itself too seriously either. It is what it is and it is well done for the genre ? a good Saturday night movie.</fullReview>

It was fun,clever, action packed, sweet in places, fun, and..oh yeah..FUN! I saw it with a good sized audience in the the theater tonight and everyone was laughing and oooohhhhhing and clapping and having a great time. This is exactly what an action movie should be.The cast was excellent. Bruce was at his Bruce-y best. Morgan was sweet and suave. John Malkovich was freaking hysterical in every scene and Helen Mirren managed to make blowing up the enemy look like it was nothing more strenuous than combing her hair. She was all class and grace. If I had one bad thing to say about this movie it was that there was not enough Helen Mirren in it.Don't listen to the negative nellies who hate everything that comes out these days. This movie was fantastic. Everyone from my 13 year old son to my 75 year old mom loved every minute.</fullReview>

He should retire in real life as his character has in the movie.There is zero chemistry between Bruce and his so called love interest: Parker. Parker is annoying as hell. As well as Mirren. Freeman and Malkovich. The only one giving a good performance in this awkward unfunny action comedy is Karl Urban. I root for him. Not the old Bruce (Douchebag) Willis and his really old friends.Avoid this, unless you're a Mirren or Malkovich fan. Evereyone else should stay clear of this crap and watch or re-watch The Last Boyscout.

		<fullReview>I never read the comic books, so I couldn't compare it. I didn't really like this movie as well as I thought I would. There were a few decent action scenes that caught my attention. John Malkovich had some funny one-liners. Bruce Willis was the better actor in this film. The rest of the story just has them talking. Frank Moses, Joe Matheson, Marvin Boggs, and Victoria are retired CIA agents. They are soon targeted for assassination. They must team up and work together to figure out who wants to kill them and why. Frank brings along a woman named Sarah who is his 'sorta-kinda' girlfriend. Don't expect too much while seeing this movie. If you want a bland action film to only see maybe once or twice in your life, you might like RED!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The CIA starts killing off some of its old, retired operatives and that's when the trouble starts. . .And a LOT of people start getting killed.It's Bruce Willis' cool aplomb as he moves through each scene with ease and a little smirk that makes this movie non-stop hysterical. Malkovich is off the wall screamers funny, but the others are funny because they carry the lines with total straight-faced élan that I am SURE there had to be a few re-shoots just to edit out the snickers. Especially when the lines are played off Karl Urban's character who is a great granite-faced straight-man.And the action was over the top and fun-- Guns, Guns, LOTS of AMMO expended and one beautifully crafted fight scene in the CIA office that had me wincing! And Helen Mirren is fabulous. White-haired, Poised, Concerned, and deadly. And shooting a GATLIN GUN for crissakes. But best moment: an impromptu 'Girl-Talk' moment with Moses's new girlfriend while manning a sniper rifle.Absolutely Girlfriend-Friendly Guys, (it IS a light romantic comedy) but it won't cut into your testosterone enjoyment. . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A color lost in the shuffle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has crossed a threshold of tolerance in creative redundancy, and Red serves as a great example. Sure, it's based on a DC Comics graphic novel that was out years ago and had it been released as a feature film any other year we wouldn't be having this conversation. But now, in 2010, we have a succession of like movies pouring into theatres and Red is lost in the shuffle.Frank (Bruce Willis) is living a boring life in retirement, as observed through the obligatory daily routine montage (an apparent domestic independent filmmaker must these days). He spends his free time reaching out over the phone to Sarah (Mary-Louise Park), who becomes as target due to association. You see Frank is RED, a CIA operative who is classified as retired extremely dangerous, and someone wants him dead. This forces Frank to meet-up with his old pals Joe (Morgan Freeman), Victoria (Helen Mirren), and Marvin (John Malkovich) .Together they fight their way to the top of the CIA in the name of getting their lives back to normal.Two positives stand out. For one the cast is rich with well-known talents who don't drop the ball. Mirren and Freeman could use more screen time; while the former makes it count, I'm afraid the latter is served up with negligible material. Red has some mildly amusing scenes, and I think what helps nudge it along the correct path is the mature cast. Otherwise I can't find a unique concept. Some of the action is clean and easy to comprehend, generally effective. Some gags are worthy of a grin, but nothing more. Red isn't working overtime to raise the bar.The theme of government killers being hunted by their former employer has been greatly exploited this year; I think Hollywood is trying to enforce a human rights view. It's not right for me to place the blame on Red, but I am reminded of At The Movies when Siskel and Ebert judged Predator as an inferior Aliens clone. Maybe if The Losers was a critical slam dunk last year we could point and scream (coincidence that both have an explosive scene amid shipping containers?) Since this subgenre overload has come all at once, it's impossible to single out one as the cheat. Nonetheless there is some fatigue in repeatedly seeing the same treatment played out before you. Even if Red came first, I wasn't having the knee-slapping good time the generic muzak score was suggesting. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow.This film has it all.When you must watch every last bit of a film, even when the credits are rolling. When every little thing is done just right. God this film makes you forget Cop Out was even made.Shame on Morgan Freeman's part, badly written, too short and too peripheral, but everything else is plain brilliant. John Malkovic is a gem. Helen Mirren .. is good, her part small but the casting got it spot on. Perhaps a fault lies in the script introducing main characters so late in the film, but - trust me - this works nonetheless. Not a single bad actor in the film, maybe young CIA stud and chief "bad guy" for most of the film Karl Urban is a bit wooden, but i guess they wanted it that way(he does cheese up the ending a bit..seemed almost embarrassed at being in the same shot as bona fide giants Willis and Malkovic). But seriously, this film is just so awesome.Make no mistake, this film is an action-comedy; There's blood, gore and violence but its never meant to be real, in any way. Bruce Willis plays the role of his life, and you know he's just best at doing fun stuff rather than dark brooding heroes. Think him in the pink rabbit costume. Or in shorts and billboard in Harlem. So RED is not just awesome, its absolutely hilarious. Go watch it, it will make everyone happy - action fans, comedy lovers, and even the girlfriend - light hearted and none-too soppy romance slipped in the script(cheese-free).Final vote.. undecided. 8 leaning towards 9.You would really be punishing yourself by missing this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got back from the theater.I can't remember that last time I have so THOROUGHLY ENJOYED myself! There is a 'vibe' to this film that if you can go with it, will bring a smile to your face for 2 hours.It's actually a very gentle film - despite all the explosions and guns a blaring. It's also a tender lover story (a couple of them, really) - but all encased in a gentle and funny action comedy.The plot has to do with retired assassins, but what makes the film work is the acting, direction, timing and dialog. Every frame is filled with a wink and a nudge and a smile.There are gut busting scenes, but mainly just a lot of smiles and small laughter that are gingerly peppered across the film.While there is action, I would definitely not call this an action film. Die hard action junkies will be disappointed.If you want to see a sweet film, full of laughs, warmth, witty dialog, great acting and lots of explosions and gun fights - this is the film to see.I think all the actors were great - it's hard to pinpoint any single great performance. Willis, Freeman and Malkovich have never been better. and the minor parts by Borgnine and Dreyfuss just added icing on the cake.I lost track of how many times I laughed and clapped my hands. I honestly cannot remember doing that in a theater in a VERY long time.Bravo to everyone involved..Could a film staring Willis and freeman as assassins with explosions be the feel good movie of the year? It was to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reclining Extremely Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Red" is bland. Jilting its vibrant namesake, director Robert Schwentke's pallid comic book movie is about as exciting as a grayscale rainbow. It's a self-celebratory slog and one of the longest hour and fifty minutes I've spent at the movies this year. In my defense, its trailer was a calculated work of CIA-level deception?each moment is expertly chosen to give false impression that the whole is mindless fun. But mindless fun is only half right.There's next to nothing to say about a film this unremittingly boring. I'd stop just short of calling it a failure, but the most incredible thing about "Red" is that such a lackluster script attracted such high-profile talent.The cast, including Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, and Mary Louis-Parker, along with Karl Urban, Brian Cox and Richard Dreyfuss, speaks for itself. That's part of the problem. "Red" relies too heavily on big names to make the material pop rather than directly addressing the many problems with its confusing, amorphous screenplay. Surely it seemed like a pretty safe conclusion?I'm as surprised as anyone that a film this stacked could be so completely devoid of personality.Then there's the not-so-insignificant fact that our leading man is the most uninteresting person in the entire film. Black ops superhero Frank Moses never lives up to his reputation? pity Willis doesn't supply his own. His character is meant to be a "romantic" at heart, but his relationship with dopey civilian Sarah Ross is just as unconvincing. Moses isn't a compelling protagonist?and he's shown up repeatedly. First by Malkovich as an LSD-warped CIA retiree, but also by Freeman, who is in the film for maybe a combined ten minutes.I'm not gunning for Bruce, though. "Red" is an amalgam of creative failures in which his is the very least offensive. It was never going to be a great film given the inept writing of Jon and Erich Hoeber, though under Schwentke's direction it isn't even passable. He attempts to pawn "Red" off as disposable entertainment, but reneges on the 'entertainment' part. It's the type of movie that squeaks by on a slow weekend, but would have been justly ignored had it been released three months ago.Even its music is egregious. Not since Soderbergh's "The Informant!" has a film been so tonally altered through soundtrack and score. Composer Christophe Beck imbues each languid scene with a false sense of energy?be it bouncy, comedic accompaniment or nondescript action orchestral?but he fails to make a case for them. In fact, his music underscores the dichotomy between sound and sight; he makes us acutely aware of what we should be feeling, but aren't.Collectively, "Red" is one massive miscalculation: criminally overlong and underwhelming given the caliber of talent on hand. There's no reason why this shouldn't have offered the same breezy fun as "The Losers" and "Knight and Day" did earlier this year, flawed though they were. Schwentke attempts to mend a Humpty Dumpty script by infusing it with style and enunciating its humor, but the former comes off as gimmicky and the latter is a series of embarrassing air balls. Joke upon joke was met with stifling silence from the crowd."Red" is one of the most colorless films in recent memory. In it, the acronym 'R-E-D' stands for "Retired; Extremely Dangerous," but I've come up with an abbreviation that far better describes the experience: "Reclining; Extremely Disappointed."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Red." A Romantic Comedy for Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get this on the table now, I am an American man. I like red meat, apple pie, baseball and women who are armed and dangerous. I ask for nothing more. Well, one more thing, if one of those armed and dangerous women could also have been a recipient of an Oscar for portraying the Queen of England. "Red" is an acronym, in CIA terminology, for Retired and Extremely Dangerous. The film is based on the graphic novel of the same name. Directed by Robert Schwentke and employs a multitude of great actors and actresses who bring the story to life. The story provides a whirlwind of travel from one American city to the next. While using the film's time wisely to unravel clues about who is trying to kill the ex-CIA team from a 1981 Colombian CIA operation.We begin the film with ex-CIA agent Frank Moses (played by Bruce Willis) who is living a meager day-to-day life with no excitement and no cause to look forward to the future. He wakes up alone, he eats alone, and he even takes out the recycle bin alone. Most recently he decorated his home for the Christmas holiday when he realized his was the only house on the block that was barren. He does everything a good citizen must do in suburban Cleveland, Ohio to keep up appearances. He has one ray of sunshine in his life. He makes calls to his customer service rep at the pension services office, Sarah Ross (played Mary-Louise Parker), to hear her voice and talk about romance novels. Sarah, too, is miserable in her dead-end job. We see an over the phone connection between the two characters. If you have seen one romantic comedy in your life, you will see what is going on here. Two lonely souls make a connection but are separated by two cities. However, in "Red" one of the lonely souls is an ex-CIA killer, you won't find that in the typical romantic comedy formula. Late one night Frank gets up to go to the kitchen and is attacked by a CIA team of killers. Grenades are thrown, machine guns are fired, bullets are fried in a pan (really it happens) and we are following Frank to Kansas City, Mo. to pick up Sarah to let her know that she is in trouble. From there we are yanked down to New Orleans to find Frank's old CIA buddy Joe Matheson (played by Morgan Freeman). While in the French Quarter we are entertained with an amazing shot of Frank exiting a spinning cop car to unload an entire clip from his handgun into the windshield of his would-be assailant, William Cooper (played by Karl Urban). I am done telling you about the story line. It's a good story line but I have to tell you I haven't seen action from an experienced cast like this in a long time. Sure I can compare this to "The A-Team" and "The Losers." Sure it has the basic story line about a team of special ops killers who are doubled crossed and they need to find out who is behind it all. But, I want to tell you what great fun it is to watch someone who portrayed a queen (Helen Mirren) take a firing stance behind a .50 caliber machine gun to mow down a limousine. I want to tell you how someone who once drove "Miss Daisy" (Freeman) and the guy who once played Biff Loman in "Death of a Salesman" (John Malkovich) interrogate the nerdy marine biologist from "Jaws" (Richard Dreyfuss). I can't forget to tell you how the guy from "Die Hard" (Willis) is back doing what Americans love to watch him do ? eliminate the bad guys with a calm, cool attitude. We, the people, deserve this movie, we have earned the right to put $10 down at the box office and say "give me four A-list actors with lots of explosions and car chases and even a little romance. Because after a summer of watching sub-par movies we need to be reminded how much fun it is to hear old people jokes. Then see those 'old people' exact their revenge on the system."Should you see this movie? Are you a red-blooded American? Then yes, go see it. This is your right to turn off your mind for a while and be grateful that you live in a country where you can watch absurd violent behavior by retirees. While all along you see a loving relationship between a man and woman blossom before your eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK effort but just not more than basic stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With its jazzy score and high quality cast, Red thinks it's a pretty cool movie and to be fair at times it is, but for me just not overall. It uses action well and uses it enough not to make you think about the plot going on around it too much but it isn't good enough for me to cover the pretty average movie this is. It's pretty generic really, I mean don't get me wrong it tries to maybe make itself feel new and refreshing but for me it never steps up to a level at which it needs to get to if it wants to be enjoyable, but actually not also brainless. The plot revolves around an old team of RED (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) ex agents who come together to try and stop high skilled assassins and thugs sent from unknown assailants. The cast has a lot of big names in it, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren and other names where you just might watch thinking "Hey its them, what are they doing in this". It does kind of feel odd if you come from the perspective of knowing nothing about this, big names are basically turned into action stars and with the exception really of Bruce Willis, many of the big names in this you would not expect to ever see them in such roles. They have fun for sure and it is fun in certain moments, but I feel it isn't fun enough and it never does enough to truly feel satisfactory. Bruce Willis as Frank Moses is, well he looks bored in the role, he isn't great here and although I think he is great casting, he doesn't do a good job. For me the two polar opposite actors here are Mary-Louise Parker who is pretty bad and John Malkovich who is pretty awesome, could not be different in how they play out their individual roles.Robert Schwentke directs and he doesn't do a great job, doesn't get enough out of the story and although the action is well taken care of, some choices in the pacing and timing of things is not done well. Too often in this it is a case of why didn't they shoot them in the head, why did they take so long to shoot and ultimately, who would or how would you ever get out of that or do such a thing. I don't like to criticise a film like this too much I mean it is mediocre but does contain some OK bits certainly, as mentioned the action is good, Malkovich is pretty funny and sometimes the cast can make all the difference in a scene, so this is not all bad by any means.I must mention the screenplay from Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber who both create a script that could I guess on paper look pretty nice but when visualised like how it is, just does not. The movie looks like it wants to be stylish with nicely done stunts, pretty pumped up action characters and a score that gives off a smell of self- satisfaction. In fact on the point of self-satisfaction, that is the one thing I truly felt made this irritating, you can see where the people making this thought "oh that looks cool, put it in" and I don't mean the actors but just the technical side of things as all. I'm not going to say don't see this, it's nothing bad in fact I don't even think it's poor but it is average though, same old and it just for me couldn't escape that feel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Red (2010): Dir: Robert Schwentke / Cast: Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Mary-Louise Parker: While The Expendables summoned popular action celebrities, Red seems to joke about the idea of bringing together the elderly. It regards survival not just in the plot, but in age itself. Bruce Willis plays a retired C.I.A. Whose house is shredded with bullets. He seeks out his old team in hopes to solve a case regarding a murdered journalist connected with a story that occurred nearly thirty years earlier that connects them all. Robert Schwentke previously made Flightplan, which had Jodie Foster and a decent budget to keep it in the air. Here humour and action take centre stage as our retired heroes embark upon one near death situation after another. Willis has sly comic disposition as his bored retired life leads to phone conversations with a consumer service agent whom he ends up kidnapping during his initial escape because his phone conversations are tapped. These moments are amusing but eventually he will jump into much physical violence including killing someone with a blow to the throat. Morgan Freeman plays a retired agent in a retirement home dying of cancer who makes it his last task to assist his friend. John Malkovich is very funny as a conspiracy theorist with information to aid the mission. Helen Mirren steals scenes as a retiree yearning to return to action and finding romance in the process. Mary-Louise Parker plays a kidnap victim who provides greater comic relief. Pointless amusing entertainment that isn't expendable like that other film. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"RED" is a 2010 film written by the Hoeber brothers and directed by German Robert Schwentke. It managed a Golden Globe nomination for Best Comedy/Musical although it is not really a comedy. Its comedic moments mostly come from John Malkovich in the first half of the film. That said, the first half is better than the second in my opinion. In the center of the movie is Bruce Willis as a retired C.I.A. agent, who becomes the target of his former employer. As he tries to find out who wants to kill him and why, the audience gets all it can expect from a Bruce Willis film (lots of it you have probably seen already in 10 other films starring him). Lots of gunfighting, lots of explosions and in the end even the Vice President as a target. The latter is played by Julian McMahon from Nip/Tuck. I really like him, so I was a bit disappointed his role wasn't bigger. Morgan Freeman, Bryan Cox and Helen Mirren help Willis' character here. And during all the action, the main character also starts falling in love with the female lead played by Mary Louise Parker (two-time Golden Globe winner for "Weeds"). Unfortunately, there was really nothing to her character. It wasn't her acting, it was just that she did not add anything at all to the story. As weird as how she met Willis' character, as weird was also everything else that involved her. She obviously loved the danger and thrill, and admired Willis all the time, but I felt this film could have worked as good or even better without her.Then there is also the agent who hunts Willis' character, played by Karl Urban. I had my problems with him too. At the beginning, he follows orders and we see he is actually a cold-blooded killer and after he gets beaten up by Willis' character, he becomes a helper to him. Obviously, the filmmakers included scenes with his family at his house to warm up to him, but the whole character development for him just felt unconvincing. The death of Moragn Freeman's character could have worked as a sad highlight of the movie, but I did not feel any sadness at all when it happened. Randomly include his cancer and then kill him off instead of the main character.Finally, I would like to say that I had a good time watching it. You should not really think too much about it and try to ignore its plot holes. If you manage to do that and enjoy the occasional action flick, this one certainly is worth watching. And if you did not enjoy it, at least keep in mind to NEVER call John Malkovich an old man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be honest - I didn't think much of this movie. I was expecting a light-hearted action flick full of special effects and cheesy one-liners that would be easy but enjoyable viewing. With an all-star cast, what could possibly go wrong?The answer is that the all-star cast was probably the undoing of this movie. None of Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman looked at home - the movie was too small, too simple, the characters too basic to give them room to put on good performances. In the end, it comes across as though their hearts aren't in it.Worst of all is the totally unbelievable love interest side-plot between Bruce Willis and Sarah Ross. Totally cringe-worthy and it didn't work.And as for the special effects and cheesy one-liners? There's a few, but nothing to get excited about. Overall it's a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally wouldn't put in an action adventure movie when I'm home alone without my husband, but I would definitely put this movie in when I'm home alone. It is so funny. It is like they took a screwball romantic comedy and an action adventure comedy that is somehow also serious and perfectly combined them. I love how the young people think it will be a piece of cake to takeout the older ones. It is so fun to root for the 'underdogs.' The opening part just cracks me up, Bruce Willis' life as a bachelor. How anybody could live that boring and own a gun and not shoot themselves in the head is beyond me. It just cracks me up every time. I hope they make more movies like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very cute little movie, fast-paced and amusing, with a lot of over the top action and good performances. It is also a movie that treats logic not just as something unnecessary, but as something to be actively avoided at all cost.Red has every type of unreality. The movie is filled with places where you'll think, no law enforcement agency would follow those procedures, or no place has such incompetent security. I can't start listing these moments, because then I would just never, ever stop. There is also ridiculous action there's a wonderful - but completely nonsensical - moment when Willis steps out of the car and starts shooting as the bumper glides an inch past his leg), but I've come to accept ridiculous action in action movies. But the nonsense extends to almost every moment of the film. If you had a drinking game where the rule was you take a drink every time you, "ah, that makes perfect sense," you would end the movie cold sober. It's one of the most remarkably sense-free movies I've ever seen.But it's fun to watch. Just turn off your brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Not necessarily a bad film, just a highly disappointing one..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RED stars Bruce Willis as retired CIA analyst Frank Moses, now deemed Retired and Extremely Dangerous by his old employers, who now hunt for him and his old colleagues, played by Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and John Malkovich, all during the first few days of Moses meeting the woman with whom he has fallen in love, Mark Louise Parker's Pension Office customer service assistant Sarah.Frankly, witnessing Dame Helen Mirren pulling the trigger on a semi automatic weapon, or John Malkovich screaming and chasing after agents with a bomb attached to his chest, is as soul destroying as it is hilarious. A high percentage of great actors and actresses get to certain age and start taking jobs that are far beneath them and this film just appears to be that gateway epitomized, the realisation that things for these four may never be the same again. Granted, it is not as black and white as that- Bruce Willis jumped the fence years ago with the likes of What Just Happened in 2007 and also Cop Out just months before RED, and this is not to say that we will never see Mirren at her best again, but with a collection of eleven Academy Award wins and nominations between just three of the four leads, this is a clear sign that the good days may well be over for this bunch. Throw 60's and 70's Hollywood heavyweights Ernest Borgnine and Richard Dreyfuss into the mix, and the outcome is a blatant list of aging, out of work ex-A- Listers attempting to ruin years of solid work and back catalogues. The fact is that this is not an exciting film. It is indeed amusing in places, mainly because of Mary Louise Parker's deadpan comments, but the action is silly and incomparably ludicrous. I am, in particular, referring to Willis standing up out of a spinning car and the ease in which the characters can infiltrate CIA headquarters with the help of a little fancy dress. The heavily stylised cinematography and use of special effects is fairly mentionable, but I fear the mention should probably go to the artists of the graphic novel, which will in no doubt have been used as a pre-existing set of storyboards, a technique many lazy directors now fall back on with adaptations of this genre.The makers were onto something, but took it too far. I would much rather have seen a film inspired by the graphic novel instead of based on it, one that tells the story of a retired CIA agent now trying to cope with pensions, dressing gowns and the woman on the end of the phone he has fallen in love with. The romance element between Willis and Parker is fun to watch, enticing and engaging, but unfortunately the action, which takes up most of the running time and energy of the film, is simply run of the mill stock action.The result is not necessarily a bad film, just a highly disappointing one, which, in my eyes, is worse. Frank Moses and his crew may well be Retired and Extremely Dangerous, however the actors themselves, after this less than dangerous display, should seriously think about retiring before it gets too much worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red - 3 Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any film that features Helen Mirren operating a mounted machine gun in a pretty white dress deserves at least three stars. And a movie that miserably fails in maximizing the fun it could get from its solid cast should not earn anything above the rating of four.Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malcovich, and Helen Mirren are outstanding actors. All of them are above the age of fifty, which is obviously not the common age for a lead role in action flick these days. That is why I admire Bruce Willis very much. At age fifty-five, he can still star in big-budgeted, stunt-filled action movies without suffering straight-to-DVD or plastic surgery.In the past few years, most of the images I see in the posters of this genre are "young" men who either look like a supermodel or a wrestler. Or Dwayne Johnson. Or Jason Statham. But anyway, the entire punchline of RED is that we get to see old-er people fire the guns and detonate the explosives.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/red/</fullReview>

No one could have done a better job. But Malkovich steals the show as the disjointed part of the team, and the film has it's best parts when he is in it.The rest of the cast are good, but it would have been nice to have seen a little more of them.Even though they are a little too slick, the set pieces are still great and keep the pace of the film running smoothly.It's a good film, but it does get a little lethargic in places, much like the cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's really not that bad for an action comedy that targets audiences of age 10. It's what I call a "comfortable" film as you find yourself surrounded by familiar faces, characters, and story lines. You can sit back and enjoy it like you do with Bugs Bunny. There are exciting shootings and explosions (and importantly the heroes come up with blackened faces only). The funny moments in the trailer are still funny because it's the kind of joke that you forget as soon as it's over. One big major flaw is the romance between ancient Bruce Willis and a young girl - the concept is too disgusting for children. Really, where's the censorship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>quite good fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a graphic novel, as everything is these days, Red (retired extremely dangerous) tells the story of Frank a retired black ops agent who must put his team back together when he realises they are all in grave danger. Frank, played by Bruce Willis is bored; the highlight of his retirement is destroying his pension checks just so he can ring Sarah at the pension company to chat. His idyllic existence is one day broken when a team of heavily armed men turn his house into dust in an attempt to kill him, it's up to him then and a few old friends to try and get to the bottom of the mysterious kill squad. Now I've not read the graphic novel so I've no idea how closely this relates, the premise is OK and it's well executed but ultimately it just falls flat, there doesn't seem to be enough substance and it ends up just being a waste of an excellent cast. Sure seeing Helen Mirren wielding heavy arms is fun but she doesn't even enter the film until the end, Willis is smirky, Malkovich is goofy, Urban is stern, Freeman should know better and Parker is well Parker. Add them all together and you should have an explosive mix but it never quite delivers on the promise. It's nice to see Richard Dreyfuss and Ernest Borgnine pop up and there are a couple of great set pieces but I couldn't shake the feeling that it should have been better than it was. Fun for a couple of hours if there's nothing else to do and you want to see Mirren kick some butt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crack a joke, snap a neck. Lament the state of the world. Wonder why the kids don't call. It's hard being a retired assassin.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When bad guys try to X Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) for no apparent reason he takes off, pausing only to gather up his call centre operator possible girlfriend Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) who he has never met before he starts to conduct his own private investigation.Despite some initial reluctance from Sarah at being apparently held hostage by a bald 50ish guy who might pose her significant threat the duo move quickly in that cinematic way and uncover a conspiracy that might go all the way to the top ? all in a few days.Along the way it becomes evident that Frank wasn't a lone target, in fact someone is systematically offing many retired secret service agents ? all now classified RED Retired Extremely Dangerous ? so Frank sets about notifying those still alive to see if they can help.In quick time the obviously paranoid, presumed dead, off the grid shut-in Marvin (John Malkovich) comes on board, as does Joe (Morgan Freeman) who is battling cancer and leaves his retirement home cushiness to help.More help comes in latter stages in the form of Victoria (Helen Mirren) and an unlikely ally in Ivan the Russian ? apparently all Russians are called Ivan.Karl Urban is secret service guy William Cooper charged with tracking down these elderly loose cannons, and Richard Dreyfuss makes a cameo as a man with all the answers.What follows is a quite enjoyable but admittedly formulaic action-comedy with maximum damage and minimal good-guy casualties. It is one of those films where you have to laugh when someone explodes as it is all so ludicrous.The good guys smile and crack jokes as they make hundreds of children orphans and the headline cast of guys more familiar holding awards instead of automatic weapons all seem to have a bit of a laugh laying waste to hundreds of fit young crack troops.Despite the subject matter and head count this is all quite breezy, light and entertaining, with chuckles and explosions favoured over logic and realism.At the conclusion of the film I wondered if this would be at all entertaining had it featured a bunch of young heavily muscled protagonists, then I answered my question pretty quickly when I realized this is The Losers Part 2, only set some 40 years on from the original.I only the thought The Losers was so-so. I think Red would be marginally better if it had a cast of young 'uns but not that much, So I guess at least part of the enjoyment was to found through the perverse pleasure of making broken hip jokes each time one of the stars threw themselves around or as Helen Mirren's floppy arm skin wobbled as she blazed away with a massive machine gun at people a third her age.The only significant downside is that for some reason one of the cast needed to find luuuuurrrrvve, hence the annoying Frank and Sarah subplot where she is supposed to go gooey as a guy who could be her Dad's golfing buddy kills another crack soldier with his bare wrinkled hands.If you miss seeing Red it is fair to say there will hardly be a massive gap in your life ? but at the same time this is an enjoyable couple of hours and it is fun to see some of the senior cits get a chance to make a few guilt free kills.Final Rating ? 7.5 / 10. Kill a young bloke, have a cup of tea. Kill another young bloke, take a nap. Crack a joke, snap a neck. Lament the state of the world. Wonder why the kids don't call ? Oh yes, you killed them. It's hard being a retired assassin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film knowing nothing more than the main cast and if you're reading this for clues on whether or not to spend your hard earned time or money on this flick I recommend, if possible, you do the same. i.e. do not read any other reviews before watching. It really is 10 out of 10. Read on if you want - no spoilers here.It's not perfect, but what film is? If I was paid to criticise it I could think of a couple minor complaints but within its genre this is as near to perfection as it gets. Other films will be remembered longer and will receive more acclaim but this movie does exactly what it sets out to do better than almost any other I can think of. And the superb cast are all... well, superb.The first few minutes will enchant you and leave you marvelling at what could possible ensue - and for this reason alone I recommend you see it without learning any more so log off right now and Go see it!!Why are you still reading??? You're wasting time. Watch it and come back here to write a review - and be sure to put a spoiler caution even if you only mention the genre.Seeing an enthralling film without knowing anything about it beforehand really is one of life's true pleasures.

For a movie that doesn't take itself seriously it is also disappointing not having one really good laugh. Your average episode of Chuck has 10 times as much humor as this whole movie.To make things worse, Mary-Louise Parker is extremely annoying. Willis and Freeman display nothing but routine. Malkovich is as painfully unfunny as the entire film.Still, I liked some action parts as well as seeing Helen Mirren with various automatic rifles.

		<shortDescription>Good Fun but With Limitations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this movie will please most, especially this time of year when usual flair is aimed at a more highbrow audience with eyes towards the Oscars, I wish more of a direction was taken than the mix of styles and substance this movie portrayed. It's as if Robert Schwentke, the director of Red, couldn't decide on doing a pure spoof of action films going with pure slapstick comedy or if he wanted a buddy caper film a la Ocean's 11 or the Italian Job.Many of these 'team' films have come out lately with the A-Team, The Expendables, The Losers and others doing a better job of mixing in their humor than Red did. Here it seemed forced and out of place most times.Don't get me wrong, it is good fun with some great actors doing great things with enough action thrown into the mix to please any popcorn crowd, however I often felt when watching these actors perform their craft I was on the outside of an inside joke.Many times they just seemed too pleased with themselves delivering campy lines and performing stunts well beyond any rational suspension of disbelief. The movie would have been much better had they taken a nod towards their age, a la The Expendables and not run around like teenagers on spring break.Reading early reviews have lauded John Malkovich's role and he is as ever a pleasure to watch on screen however he exemplifies the problems with this movie. Richard Dreyfuss, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, et all, each playing almost stereotypical roles which if hadn't been seen before would have been much more entertaining. There just wasn't much new to see in this film although it's packaged together so slickly and clean we enjoy unwrapping the present more than the gift inside. For me, lost amongst the veterans patting themselves on their collective backs, was a delightful performance by Mary-Louise Parker. She not only holds her own against these heavy weights but surprisingly in a farce based movie lends legitimacy to the chaos and ridiculous action around her.Without giving away plot and story, most action scenes and scrapes gotten into by the main characters are so far fetched and unbelievable, especially the way they escape the messes they bury themselves into in the first place, you wonder if the writers were out of original ideas and simply watched old Warner Brothers' cartoons for their plot twists.However, all this being said you will not be disappointed with Red if you go in expecting some light fun and not wanting a film which will spark much conversation afterwards. While I found myself smiling through most of the film and even laughing out loud in some parts, if I had wanted to include a favorite scene in this review I would be hard pressed to remember one with enough clarity to include thus necessitating the 'spoiler' check box to be used.Bottom line: Go and enjoy this latest Bruce Willis flick but don't expect Die Hard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun action film that shows Bruce Willis still has what it takes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Willis was a great action hero twenty years ago but does he still have what it takes? On the strength of 'Red' I'd say he does. This isn't the most cerebral film but if you want to relax and watch a decent action movie you could do a lot worse. Willis plays retired CIA agent Frank Moses who one day discovers that somebody is trying to kill him. He realises that they will go after anybody he is close to so when e goes on the run he takes Sarah with him; she is rather surprised to say the least as she had only ever spoken to him on the phone as she chatted to him when he called about his pension claims! As Frank tries to discover just who is trying to kill them he makes contact with several other retired agents and puts a team together. His search for the truth will lead him into many explosive situations, deep into the CIA and ultimately to one of the most senior people in America.Willis still has what it takes to lead an action film and Mary-Louise Parker was good as Sarah. The actors playing the other retired agents; Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Brian Cox and most surprisingly Dame Helen Mirran were great and were clearly having a lot of fun playing gun-toting OAPs! The film itself had plenty of excitement even if one or two of the special effects were rather obvious CGI, with its tongue firmly in its cheek this film was a lot more fun than I expected as it isn't too gory and the language isn't too bad can be enjoyed by older children as well as adults... I watched it with my twelve year old nephew and he enjoyed it at least as much as I did.</fullReview>

So Bruce Wilis is a "normal" guy living in a normal house when one night "The Cleaners" come to his house to kill him. He then goes on assembling his team (Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich...) to find out why were they after him. Action is in the centre of the movie and they are sticking to it which is very good. There is a lot of comedy: at some moments way to cliché in the other way to good (especially some references). A lot of laughter is guarantieed as well as a lot of action.

		<fullReview>It is hardly surprising that Hollywood would manufacture an obvious fantasy version of the plot of a venial Vice president (or right wingers behind him) ready to have countless people murdered in their quest for power as a vehicle for a group of mature actors to have a fling at an over the top action film.Eight years of Dick Cheney and his minions (and the still current irresponsible gun slinging pronouncements of a later candidate for the office) made the story all too believable. Few seriously made such charges against Cheney openly, but right wingers practically made a cottage industry out of manufacturing fictions they asked to be taken seriously along those lines about their opponents in office for years (the truly venial always think they see the rest of the world when they look in a mirror). Of course Hollywood had been here before with the masterpiece assassin film THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and lesser films like THE PARALLAX VIEW, but RED (a "humerus" acronym for Retired, Extremely Dangerous) departs from the best story telling (and reality) by seeming to launch, under extreme provocation (the first half of the film where Bruce Willis, fleeing over-the-top attempts on his life assembles his team of also targeted retired "spooks"), an an attempted assassination on a right wing politician (in the real world usually only moderates and liberals seem to get shot - but fictional reversal of the political poles seems almost traditional: look at how Alan Drury reversed the behaviors of his "liberal" and "conservative" politicians in his ADVISE AND CONSENT and its sequels). The film tries its best not to name the party or the positions of the venial V.P. in question (more an evil Dan Quayle type than a Dick Cheney look-alike) who may have initiated the string of murders, but the visual hints and the people behind him are unmistakable, and since RED is at its heart a comedy of violence, you don't need to worry too much about the politician - although anyone around him is likely to share the fate of minor supporting players on "away missions" on Star Trek.The cast is 90% of the real fun - from Bruce Willis retreading familiar territory to Morgan Freeman's usual noble support and Helen Mirren's elegance adding "pistol packing mama" and unexpected comedienne to her resume. Mary-Louise Parker's tag-along phone-in-girlfriend to Willis (kidnapped when he believes her also targeted) comes across as pretty much of an afterthought for plot purposes, but new screenwriter Jon Hoeber (his only major previous credit was the gimmick murder mystery set in Antarctica, WHITEOUT) gives her just enough comic lines to never let her seem like a drag on the story. We don't expect much more than serviceable direction from Robert Schwentke, whose most original work was on THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE, trying to expand again on ideas TV had gotten to first (he showed far more subtlety in the 2009 TV Pilot for LIE TO ME), and we don't get it, but he keeps the traffic moving and the explosions popping with (apparently) fewer actors injured than in the previews of the Broadway musical version of SPIDER-MAN, despite the higher body-count blithely depicted here.The ballet of violence played for laughs IS fun if you suspend your disbelief and moral sense - which is the only way to watch this wild exercise in star exploitation. The team assembled and the resolution achieved is so elegant in a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE fashion, one suspects the film makers thought they had a "caper film" franchise in the making ala OCEAN'S ELEVEN, and they may have, but judging from the scene just before "the crawl" of credits at the end they apparently realized they could go this way but once while the stars are fresh. Too many TV shows are mining the territory weekly for free.Still, the film is undeniable fun and the mission not quite impossible...just not for the impressionable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like RED, I couldn't help but be excited by the legendary cast and the promise of laughs a plenty. Yet somehow for me it ended with a pretty devastating sense of disappointment and emptiness.I'll attempt to break down where it all went wrong by stating that the problems are in the main fundamental. Firstly the script is as unoriginal as it gets churning out tired old clichés and drab gags that tell themselves. Secondly the direction is confused and inconsistent, director Robert Schwentke seems to try too hard to be the star of the show using distracting and overblown visuals meshed in with an unforgiving collection of load expensive gun fights. Further the film lacks the ability to find it's audience, jumping fidgetily between generic action comedy and stumbling occasionally into attempts of deeper and more contrite self-reflection.The least irritating element of the film is the cast, who with all mentioned previously are left with the unenviable task of trying to make something of out of very little. Bruce Willis leads from the front as the former Black-ops agent Frank Moses who endeavours to reunite his former crew (Mirren,Freeman and Malkovich) to help him solve an intricate plot he has unwittingly become part of, whilst dragging over-matched love interest Mary-Louise Parker along for the ride.I can't help but feel that with such an illustrious cast and big budget that this was a wasted opportunity. RED isn't half as terrible as it is disappointing yet it's just hard to shake the feeling that the cast had a much better time making it than I and many others will have watching it.5/10</fullReview>

All these actors have, in some point been in some type of action film, here they are, together in RED an amazing action packed comedy that WILL blow you away. As Ex-CIA Agents who are being mysteriously hunted down by their old profession, the Ex-Agents bond together to discover who's really behind their planned assassination and find something bigger than they all thought. RED will make you laugh, all of the jokes or references used in this film can be easily identified by the viewer. RED is one of best films this viewer has seen of this year. Therefore, 9/10 rating is given to this film, rightly earned and deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing is, I usually have high expectations for Bruce Willis movies. Stuff's gonna get blowed up. I like that. I also have an affinity for movies involving multiple Oscar-nominated actors. But too often I'm disappointed. The actors have no chemistry, and the stuff blowing up is of little consequence. But Red was different. I found it impressively exciting ? a fairly straightforward plot helped along by fun, inventive effects and truly wonderful acting.Willis plays Frank Moses, a retired former CIA agent who happens to be falling in love with the voice of the woman (Mary-Louise Parker) who's responsible for making sure his pension checks are sent. Frank intentionally rips up his checks just so he can call back and talk to Sarah some more. Okay, that's a little weird, but innocuous enough.Shortly after introduced to Frank and Sarah, a hit squad shows up at Franks home and basically destroys it, and thus our hero is on the run from whoever. He naturally travels to Kansas City to find Sarah, because he's pretty sure that the baddies who went after him had been monitoring his longish conversations with said bureaucratic wonk. Sarah's not exactly down with this strange man visiting her in the middle of the night and then taking her on a Grand Adventure, but since we know Frank's a good guy, we're sure she'll come around.Turns out, quickly enough, that someone is out to kill not only Frank but members of his old team, something about an event that occurred in Guatemala in 1981. The team, all retired, reunites to figure out what the bejeepers is going on. Frank tracks down Joe (Morgan Freeman) and Marvin (John Malkovich) and brings in Victoria (Helen Mirren), formerly of MI6. Object: break into their former place of work (CIA!) and find out what's what.Pretty standard stuff. Will the romance between Sarah and Frank? Will the team discover a Grander Conspiracy that involves some of the highest-ranking people in American politics? Will all of the team members survive? Will we discover that the guy who's supposed to take them down (Karl Urban) isn't, in fact, the baddest bad guy? Easy to figure out. But that's not the kind of movie this is supposed to be, one that needs figuring. It's an action movie with touches of comedy and quite a bit of surprising heart.The biggest asset that the movie has is its cast. It's not typical for actors who have done well by themselves in other movies to become a cohesive unit in an ensemble movie like this. Sometimes the actors try to outshine ? outact ? each other, as if to prove they are just that good. As a result, the movie suffers; the plot is relegated to the background, and everyone chews scenery. End of story.Ain't so here. These guys seem like they're long-lost friends. Willis and Freeman were infamously in the terrible Bonfire of the Vanities some twenty years ago, and Malkovich and Mirren sort of worked on The Hitchhiker's Guide, but that's about it. Mirren herself is really exceptional ? no surprise ? as a sharpshooter with her own colorful past.Any movie that makes me realize how awesome even dumb movies can be is a winning movie. Red is an escapist movie. You don't watch it to see an intricate mystery; you go to see a slam-dunk, bang-up good time. And that's what you get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While there are some sequencing issues, this movie is a lot of fun to watch with an excellent cast. Bruce Willis &amp; Mary Louise Parker are the main leads. With support like Morgan Freeman, Karl Urban, &amp; 93 year young Ernest Borgnine &amp; a large cast, this film has a boat load of talent.DC Comics seems to be great material for entertaining films. Willis seems a natural in this role as Frank Moses - a retired black operations agent who is having a phone affair with a woman in Kanas City. All of a sudden, a group of gunmen enter his house to kill him and the action starts. The humor starts to fly as well &amp; the more &amp; more people who get involved, the more fun the film becomes.The audience gets plenty of laughs with the action here, definitely worth a look.

		<shortDescription>Doesn't deliver the goods</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the face of things this movie seems to have everything going for it: with an action movie about a retired CIA agent being chased by his highly skilled pears, with Bruce Willis in the leading role, and a distinguished row of beloved actors by his side, the viewer may ask him or herself what can possibly go wrong? Surprisingly, the answer is: practically everything.After a very promising beginning, the movie very quickly ran out of steam. The remainder hour and a half exhibited a rather dull story line and action scenes that wouldn't be innovating even in the 1970s. The direction of the action scenes seem to have no soul: they were void and unoriginal, with not mush thought brought into them. Just a bunch of people running around with guns doesn't quite cut it in today's standards. After so many action films being produced in the last three decades, the viewers thirst for something new. This movie just repeats old formulas and is not even good at that.Other than in the beginning there was a rather well done action scene at an air port. Too bad it was highly unrepresentative to the rest of this movie. On any other respect, the movie seemed to deteriorate as it went on. The end-scene was as unreliable as it was anti-climatic. The villains were shallow: their motivations were unclear and unreliable, and there was nothing particularly interesting about them. To sum up in tow words: disappointing, unfulfilling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Retread and Extremely Disappointing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'RED': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A cast of high caliber veteran celebrities highlights this DC comic's graphic novel adaptation. Robert Schwentke (who's directing credits include 'FLIGHTPLAN' and 'THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE') directs this tale of a team of 'retired and extremely dangerous' (which is what the acronym stands for) CIA agents called back into action after being framed and setup for assassination. The film stars John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman and sadly Bruce Willis (but I guess he's beginning to get that age where he fits in with a cast of old timers) as the team. The film also co-stars Mary-Louise Parker, Karl Urban, Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfuss and Ernest Borgnine. The cast is pretty impressive, the rest of the film not so much.Willis plays the leader of the team Frank Moses. As the movie opens he spends his time flirting with a federal clerk named Sarah Ross (Parker) on the phone, falsely reporting lost retirement checks. He's attacked at his home one day and of course being Bruce Willis he manages to overcome the team of assassins sent to kill him and immediately flees to aide Ross knowing they'll come after her next due to his romantic interest in her. He takes her against her will and rounds up his old team (Freeman, Malkovich and Mirren) and alerts them of their danger. The team once again reunites in order to use their collective skills and resources to find out why they've been framed and staged for assassination and save themselves from extermination. Urban plays the lead CIA agent hot on their trail.The movie looks and sounds like a lot of fun but the fun is slammed down the viewers throat to the point where it's not really fun anymore. The actors are all good in their roles and fittingly cast (except for Freeman who is shamefully underused and the way he's written in and out of the film is embarrassing, for an actor of his stature) but the material they have to work with is weak and the direction is routine and uninspiring. Every joke is forced and every action scene is by the numbers and somewhat boring (mostly, there are a few exceptions). The movie is extremely cheesy in the way it pauses for each actor to have their moment, in the middle of what should be an intense action scene. It's just a huge gimmick and at no time feels like a genuine action / comedy. I'm amazed at the number of critics that sold out and gave this film a good review. That's why you never trust a critic. This movie is mediocre at best and entirely disappointing.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4rYA-j3f3c</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was a bad movie. it had horrible acting for one. also this had four stars and it was only about one. it had a horrible plot that could of been solved easily and quickly. how can a legendary actor like Morgan freeman be in this kind of movie. and he died twice. the first time you thought he died with a gun pointed at him and you don't know if he was shot or not. then he re appears in the film and he survived by turning around with a gun and shot the guy that had the gun pointed at him. then dies again this time for real stalling for Bruce Willis character to escape. knowing how smart they are wouldn't you think that he would put some sort of protection to protect him. of course not. the only bright side to this film was john malkovich. he did great in secretariat and in this with him being hilarious. like when they found out who set them all up which was the vice president Robert Stanton he ran at him and secret service screaming with a fake bomb attached to his chest til they got in a limo to safety only to find out Willis was the driver. anyway i do not recommend this movie if you want an action but if you want a comedy trying to be an action film but doesn't succeed with bad acting and a bad story this is the movie for you. if you want a funny Bruce Willis movie see the movie cop out. that was a good movie. as for RED. don't see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the cast list for this action comedy, I was so intrigued I had to watch it. Brucie, we all understand. His last couple of action comedies have been disappointing though so a real return to form is most welcome, Hail to the King, Baby! Morgan, perfect in support both for action &amp; comedy. I enjoy everything he turns his hand to and he's having a blast all the way. John Malcovich, consummate actor playing for laughs and having a ball. Surprising, Inspiring, Brilliant. GREAT casting choice. Brian Cox, another favourite who's support adds weight to the whole shebang (I'm somewhat biased hailing from the same toon!) The always impeccable Ernest Borgnine has still got it! Dame Helen wielding heavy weapons?!!! The scriptwriters hit me for 6 with that premise. The last time I laughed out loud at the mere description of a film was Arnie &amp; and Danny DeVito in 'Twins'! None of the above cast list is a new face. We've all got a view on what we have &amp; haven't enjoyed seeing them do on the big screen so you kind of expect them to play to their strengths...&amp; there's no disappointment, everybody does. However, something magical happens when actors at the top of their game just decide to have fun with what could have just been a reasonably funny script. There's a genuine chemistry, warmth and comedic performance above and beyond the ordinary with this gang. Nobody has to try too hard, it just comes naturally. Just to add to that joy, they're ably supported by the younger team of players. The interplay, hooks and playoffs move the story along with aplomb. What makes it stand out is almost every scene you can see they're having fun. There's some unexpected twists, Morgan's part throws up some surprises but let's face it the BIG surprise is the world's sexiest sixty year old Helen Mirren wielding the cake tray then the heavy weaponry?!! Did I mention she's sexy? I adored Mary-Louise Parker who was Brucie's love interest but Dame Helen, it's not just the acting chops.There's an old story in Hollywood that actors can still get the roles until they're well past their prime but actresses are all washed up once they're 40. Can someone PLEASE sit EVERY casting director in the world in front of this film then because I would like to speak on behalf of the entire male population of the world (&amp; probably most women) i.e. that audience you're trying to attract. There's not a living, breathing male on the planet doesn't recognise beauty and talent...today it goes by the name of DAME HELEN MIRREN. Any chance we can see more of our favourite actresses given fun roles once they reach their prime? I'm not going to go into the details of the plot as I don't want to spoil it for you so here's my adviceSEE THIS NOW!You won't regret it. A hoot from start to finish!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"RED" is a mildly amusing romantic comedy in a violent setting, with uninspiring camera work, mediocre direction, almost devoid of suspense and generally poor action sequences. Filled with supposedly clever comedy clichés, it only produces a couple of laughs during the entire film.The only saving grace are the performances, with Karl Urban being the best, closely followed by Morgan Freeman and Mary-Louise Parker, and with Bruce Willis being in his element with a solid but predictable performance. Both John Malkovich and Helen Mirren's considerable talents are largely wasted in this film, both being pretty much toothless, although it does suits Helen Mirren to wield huge guns.With the right director and camera work, this film could have been so much better and actually deserves it!</fullReview>

Suddenly at night a special ops team is sent to kill him but he wipes them out. He ends up kidnapping the girl, Sarah, for her own good. They continue to be chased by the CIA and its main operative Cooper. Frank meanwhile recruits other retired CIA people to help him out and even an old KGB/FSB agent. They are all too happy to help him.Frank decides he's got to find out what this is all about. A reporter has been writing a story and kept a list of names, all of which but one have been killed. Frank and Sarah break into the secret CIA archive room to recover a file on an operation that Frank and the others were involved in Guatemala. Turns out the vice-president in his youth was in the military and committed some serious crimes in Guatemala and Frank's team cleaned it all up. When the reporter started investigating the story, it was time to clean up the clean-up team. They also go after the one guy left, an arms contractor/dealer that is too valuable for the government to eliminate. Frank decides to mount a complex operation to get the vice president, who is about to announce that he will run for president.Red is somewhat entertaining light action that pretends to be a comedy as well, although there isn't much humor. There is a need for movies like Red that rehabilitate older actors, now that Hollywood has overdone the teen mania for more than a decade. It's time for a generational balance instead of the either/or absolutisms. At the same time, I'm tired of Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman, who are among the few older actors who survived the Hollywood decimation of the aged. It's time to retire these two for good and give others a chance. Not to mention that Willis's skin looks far too artificially smooth for a retiree. The movie's pace is slower which is alright, but somehow production felt it was necessary to subject us to constant obnoxious silly caper music. It's insufferable.A lot of fuss was made about the supposed extreme and surprising violence. Other than two guys being blown to pieces, there's nothing outrageous here or surprising. What is pointless is the fake comedic angle that Hollywood always uses to cloak its violence in or any other disagreeable issues. Red while entertaining also got on my nerves. On the other hand, the lovely Mary-Louise Parker and John Malkovich steal the show and give us a much needed respite from Willis's bald head and expressionless face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By-the-numbers action comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unwieldy combination of lame comedy and tired Hollywood-style action, RED is so staggeringly by-the-numbers that you can almost see the gears grinding and the multiple scriptwriters trying to come up with the next gag or action scene. It's also quite watchable, although completely forgettable, so much so that a week later you won't remember a single scene of it.A bored-looking Bruce Willis stars as a retired secret agent who's forced to gather together a gang of equally past-it has-beens when a group of rogue CIA agents decide to hunt them down and kill them. In essence, it's another excuse for a group of ageing stars to have one last adventure; a plot device that has been done in everything from THE WILD BUNCH to SPACE COWBOYS.RED is particularly by rote, and a typically frenetic Hollywood pacing can't hide the paucity of imagination or the distinctly unimpressive successful gag rate. Willis gives one of those exceptionally laid back, almost bored performances that's been blighting him recently (see A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD for the worst example), but the supporting cast, in the form of Karl Urban, Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich, are better. The less said about the female cast members the better: Mary-Louise Parker is horrible, and seems to think she's gurning her way through a rom-com, while the sight of Helen Mirren trying to act tough and wield heavy weaponry is, frankly, embarrassing.Some not-bad action scenes and a whole plethora of expensive special effects are thrown into the mix to bring things to life, while at the same time forgetting basic characterisation or even giving the audience a reason to care. It's a pity that this is the best Hollywood can do these days as it makes the era of LETHAL WEAPON et al look like halcyon years gone by.</fullReview>

It's a dull, unfunny film, but actor John Malkovich is hilarious as a paranoid old guy who excels at kicking butt.The film co-stars Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren, all ageing thespians. Schewntke thinks its funny that he's trapped these old folk in a zany action movie, but our heroes' antics aren't bizarre enough to elicit many giggles. Elsewhere, Schwentke missteps by not telling his tale from the perspective of an outsider played by Mary-Louise Parker. She plays one character's love interest, but rather than counterpoint or act as a foil to the film's inanities, Parker quickly and incredulously embraces mayhem.6/10 ? Worth no viewings.</fullReview>

The plot itself is thinner than a plot summary from an IMDb contributor who insists on writing a comment that just makes the ten line rule on this site The premise involves former black ops agent Bruce Willis getting together with a call service mature bimbo and going on the run and lots of bad guys trying to bump them off because he knows too much . Might I suggest that Willis is getting paid too much and that he's getting pursued by angry audience members who wasted their money on a cinema ticket ? Willis has appeared in so many drab action thrillers over the last few years that he's in danger of being outnumbered 7 billion to one Needless to say Willis sleepwalks through the film while saving the maiden from the bad guys which is the same as nearly every film he's done . One wonders what the likes of Malkovich . Mirren and Freeman are doing in the film but I guess word " pay " and " cheque " might have appeared somewhere . No one seems to stretch themselves and the only ordeal involved is for the audience to sit through yet another generic tongue in cheek action comedy .

		<fullReview>When I heard about this movie (and especially after watching the trailer), I was dead excited about this: a fun action movie which is simply aiming to give you a good time, which, I do not have a problem with. I liked The A-Team, simply for how fun it was to watch.Sadly, RED failed to make me laugh what so ever, and I frequently found myself bored out of my mind, painstakingly waiting for the movie to be over. Somehow, there seemed to be no life at all, whether it be in the characters or the script, regardless, something was lacking.A HUGE problem I had with the film is that the script did not know how to treat the characters properly, as there is one character who may as well not have been here at all but I will not say for those who may want to see the movie.The biggest let down of RED is that the iconic moments from the trailer sucked here. For example Helen Mirren's famous line from the trailer was disappointing, the build up was terrible and the moment itself was even worse. Likewise, the scene where Bruce Willis and John Malkovich's characters first meet, the scene was poorly handled, large due to the uninspired tone the scene had.The action sequences are fun to watch though, especially any that involve Helen Mirren or John Malkaovich, who steal every scene they are in by the way, as does Mary Louise Parker and Morgan Freeman. But sadly, Bruce Willis comes off one dimensional and very flat, which was a shame as I know he is a good actor.Overall, for me, the film was too dull, the script didn't do anything for me and half the characters I felt were pointless and therefore, a waste of talent here. But there will be people who will enjoy this film and good for you, I am glad you were able to sit down and have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fluffy Action Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The action comedy Red is directed by Robert Schewentke and stars Bruce Willis, Mary Louise Parker, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, Karl Urban and Brian Cox. The film takes place all over the country and is set in modern day.Frank Moses (Willis) is retired and extremely dangerous. He calls up the pension office frequently just so he talk to Sarah Ross (Parker) because he admires her. When a group of assassins tries to kill Moses he goes to Kansas City and kidnaps Ross because he fears that she may also be in danger. William Cooper (Urban) is a CIA agent who is assigned to track to Moses and take him down. Moses must find out why he is being hunted and he goes to his old friends Marvin Boggs (Malkovich), Joe Matheson (Freeman), and Victoria (Mirren) to help uncover the wide spread conspiracy. Nothing is more dangerous than the retired and extremely dangerous.The screenplay by Jon and Erich Hoeber was weak and conventional. Every twist and turn was easily foreseen and I felt no attachment to any of the characters. Let's just start with something that annoyed me at the very beginning of the film. When the assassins enter Moses' home they would not be all grouped together because they could easily be shot down, they would separate and cover the whole house. Then after that the group of assassins outside of the house just shoot at the house in the middle of a neighborhood. Ridiculous! It would be so much easier to just do a search and destroy, not just a shoot a lot and hope you kill the guy. Now onto the characters. There was no need for Frank Moses to have a love interest, it just makes the film more corny. Secondly I never got to know either Moses or Ross. The character description for Moses would be retired CIA agent and Ross would be normal woman. That is all that you know about those characters. On a positive note there were some funny lines in the screenplay, most of them were from Marvin Boggs. Still though it is not a good comedy, and as you can see from my above comments it is not a good action film.Robert Schwentke's direction was not terrible, even if it was great I could not give this film higher than a 7/10. He had some cool special effects going on, such as when Moses gets out of the police car and just starts shooting like it is nothing. But Schewentke is also to blame for the way the assassins at the beginning were choreographed so there goes the director points for cool special effects. Besides the special effects though there was nothing amazing about the shot choices. I can't imagine him giving much direction to the actors since they are all veterans. Willis, Freeman, Malkovich, and Mirren probably said to Schwentke during rehearsal how he isn't necessary to be there, we all know how to not really act in a movie that will hopefully win the opening weekend.There were a lot of stylistic choices in the editing by Thom Noble. All the transitions with the post cards were an interesting touch to the film, it definitely didn't hurt it at all. I felt at times though that Red was trying to imitate Kick Ass with all of the special effects and stylistic editing. That isn't a bad thing but if it was it did not really compete with Kick Ass in that category.The acting overall I would have to say is pretty poor, with one exception. Bruce Willis basically just read the lines and looked all suave, and he was a poor lead. He in no way brought me into the film the whole time I just kept thinking this movie is made for people to feel like they are watching a movie. The same goes for Mary Louise Parker, in how she just played a conventional normal woman put under extreme circumstances. Now the only person in this film that I can actually say is good is John Malkovich. He is great as being a paranoid, insane, ex spy who just wants to kill everyone and thinks everyone is trying to kill him. Almost all the laughs in the film comes from him, he steals the show away. Morgan Freeman is like Bruce Willis who plays a suave guy with a couple of one liners, nothing too special. Helen Mirren has a small part but she also brings in a few good one liners. Karl Urban plays the CIA agent trying to kill Frank Moses and he is decent nothing special. He in no way does a bad job, he just doesn't do a good job. I just have to say that the woman that Urban's character takes orders from in the film is probably one of the worst actresses I have ever seen. All she does is say lines with an evil voice. I'm not going to look up her name because then she wins. Lastly Brian Cox is kind of decent as a Russian spy guy, he gives a few laughs out.If you were really hoping to see a movie that is extremely thin then this is the one for you. I'm giving this a 5/10 just because Malkovich did some strong work in here. If you want to know some better action comedies than this off the top of my head there is Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Live Free or Die Hard, and True Lies. This is just a light hearted movie, so if that's what you're into then watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a breath of fresh air. No character dominated the film, each actor contributing in his/her own way, to this hilarious, well scripted piece of entertainment. I have seen this movie 3 times already and loved it more each time. The highlight was the fact that the action scenes were very tastefully done, and didn't overshadow the rest of the film, like Stallone's sad effort know as the "Expendables" did. I would recommend this film to everyone over the age of 13... there is some language, but it is not overly offensive to younger audiences that have been exposed to PG13 movies before. If you have any doubts about seeing this movie, go to a matinée... you will be pleasantly surprised!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willis make sit good, but Mary-Louise Parker is awful as always..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed just about everything in this movie, except Mary-Louise Parker. Seems to be the nw genre, old action guys come out of retirement. Well, there seems to be little to no new action guys that can make a movie and do big at the box office. So the old guys get together. Well in this movie it seems to work just fine. The story is good enough to keep your interest and some good twists and surprises. Willis does the coolest new move/effect I have seen in a movie. This "stepping out" is gonna be used a lot now (I think). Now a bit a bout the bad parts. Mary-Louise Parker. She is a waste of talent. She is the same in every role she plays. Has only 2 faces, stoned and confused (and obviously they are very similar, her smile is what makes them differ...) She was a poor choice for this movie. But what's done is done. What has been seen, cannot be unseen.... I have not been a fan of Malkovich, but even he was good here. Borgnine is still alive? WOW! Great to see him for a bit! Otherwise, it has everything you need in a good action flick - moves, clichés, laffs, twists...All worth it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun, but a little old and predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First up, I have to say that when I entered the theatre I thought I had just walked in a retirement home. Sorry grandpa. However, perfect setting for the movie I guess. Anyway, the action starts slow in this one and sort of keeps the same pace through out. There are great moments here and there. It was certainly fun to watch and hear the fifty and sixty years old couples in front of me clapping and laughing. For the action part, I give it a 5 giving today's action standard. The story line kind of vague, and giving this is a DC Comics adaptation, I find it surprisingly boring. However, Bruce, Morgan, John and Helen, wow, what can I say. Put them together, it is like an acting university with every genre you can imagine. Individually, they are unbelievable. All together, no matter how bad the other actors are and how weird certain moments are, they simply make you feel great and nod and smile and laugh and whatever you feel like doing. I will happily surrender my $12.50 again to watch them in action. Also surprisingly good is the funny and wacky Marie Lou Parker and of course Brian Cox. I want to say that the acting is at least an 8. But that will be unfair. Because for these guys and ladies, they don't need to act. So there you have it. It is a fun movie. I probably will bring my dad to watch again. Better yet, let my dad take my mom to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Babe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We shouldn't be surprised at the appearance of the geezer action genre. Simple market forces will change every genre and I suppose we will have young (very young) and old versions of most genres, just as we already have (and always have had?) in popular music. It is no surprise that the two latest experiments feature the two guys who are credited with inventing the summer blockbuster: Stallone and Willis. Also, because these are manufactured items designed by witless managers, it will be no surprise that they have as much value as a modern breakfast cereal.But what is interesting is how the geezer genres will have to adapt certain rules of the genre. So many of those rules depend on the role of the babe. You know, the sexy young thing that gets rescued? Or the sexy young couple that is the first to go in a slasher film because they are being punished for showing us sex? I went into this knowing that the chases would be chasey, the explosions nice and screenfilling orange, the bad guys the same we know. I knew the dialog would have the same, bankable flippant style. I knew where everything would be placed but the babe. What to do about the babe?I consider this an experiment, and not the solution we can expect to see. But here's what they decided.The traditional babe, the one that is simply along so that she can be protected by the strong man? She is played by the nearly 50 year old Mary-Louise Parker. Even in her youth and from the very beginning, her casting was exclusively in off-sex roles, roles that openly contradicted the babe stereotype. This was not in any conventional way, like Jennifer Jason Lee has covered. Just quirky and plain. Her plainness and lack of ordinary character is emphasized here. This, I think was so that they could shift the babe focus from the passive one to an active babe.And who for that? The first one cast, Hellen Mirren. So far so good. Helen has built a career from the beginning (and she says, a life) based on open sexuality. Greenaway's "Cook, Thief" is how most of us remember her "middle age" sexuality. I suppose that when she was cast, the idea was to have her in a lusty comic relationship with Bruce. There is some remnant of this intent with a backstory about her affairs and one real love with a Russian spy. Her character is supposed to be the most ruthless and accomplished, her job description not being spy but assassin.That would have been an interesting experiment. The woman knows how to project inclusive desire that transcends body shape. She is an intelligent enough actress to know how to bend the overt penile fascination with guns, and we do see a scene where that was clearly intended. But in the rewrites and tests and reshoots, the more adventuresome female juice was blotted away. There are some closeups of her face where the makeup is designed to emphasize wrinkles. Look closely at these scenes and you will see that the closeups are a later addition.The scene where she shoots thousands of depleted uranium 50 caliber bullets like a frenzied bull? Well, her costume is very considered. I imagine there were scenes that were cut that allowed her to move that dress in notable ways. What is left however is a braless shape reminiscent of a demented baglady.Strange. A strange experiment. I wonder what they will do next?I saw this with an old guy whose only thrill was in recognizing the Swedish K, and in knowing that the variant shown in the movie "wasn't right."Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Losers, The A-Team, The Expendables....RED.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>R.E.D stands for Retired and Extremely Dangerous. That's what has been tagged to Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) and he is a target of a hit. The ones trying to kill him underestimated his skills and he is out on a mission to find out who is trying to kill him and his maybe girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker). So he rounds up the gang and they set out to find out who is behind everything. RED is pretty much exactly like the other films I mentioned before (Losers, A-Team, Expendables) with only difference is that this film's angle is that the people who are dangerous are retired old people. The cast has Bruce Willis, doing his John McClane thing without the one-liners and more precision. Morgan Freeman pulling his Wanted role but in a good guy role. John Malkovich playing a retired CIA test subject that has been given daily doses of LSD for 11 some odd years. He seems like one of the Malkovich's that crawled out of the tunnel to his body in Being John Malkovich. Helen Mirren, in an offbeat choice. She plays sexy and dangerous and can hold her own against the boys. Karl Urban is the lead CIA officer sent to take them out, he plays his assassin role from Bourn Supremacy. He follows orders, not knowing if he is doing good or bad. Of course we have the Mary-Louise Parker character, who is like the audience, not knowing any of these things we are experiencing and are along for the ride. Malkovich steals the show. He plays the role of conspiracy nut with a gun very well. He's off kilter and has the funniest bits in the film. The film is based on a comic book so you can expect over the top action and stunts. A revolver showdown versus a bazooka? Check. Playing baseball with a grenade? Check. Casually exiting a vehicle spinning out of control and nearly getting hit by the bumper while shooting at another vehicle and not blink an eye? Check. RED is over the top and funny. If you enjoyed The Losers or the A-team, Red is more of the same. I enjoyed it, the plot revolves around a cover up and an old job that comes to bite those RED members in the behind. The twists it tries to give us is half baked but forgivable because the film is, overall an enjoyment. I must criticize the relationship between Bruce Willis and Mary- Louise Parker, it doesn't seem fleshed out enough to be taken at face value. They chit chat over the phone and he kidnaps her to protect her from people who are trying to kill her because he has had so many phone conversations with her. She ends up liking the thrill and excitement of his life, yet he says that she makes him feel like he can have a normal life. This conflict is never resolved or brought up again. Morgan Freeman doesn't have enough screen time and the role could have been played by virtually anyone. Karl Urban is a likable guy, I seem to appreciate his role in everything he does, even if the film turns out to be uneven. He's good here too jumping onto moving vehicles to catch other moving vehicles (did I mention this film is over the top?) RED is enjoyable and like I said, fans of those previously mentioned films will get a kick out of this one. It blends comedy and action well enough to pass the time. It's enjoyment hangs on the fact that these old people are kicking ass. It works. I keep mentioning how over the top it is, but it never reaches the heights of the over the topness of the A-Team. If that is any indication of this style of violence. I forgot to mention Brian Cox, he plays a Russian who becomes an integral part of the 'team'. Poor guy is nowhere to be seen in the promotional ads for the film and yet he has more screen time than Freeman. Anyways, RED is good popcorn fun. It's problems are obvious ones for a film like this, but the direction is slick and the film is funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Feel Good Movie of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes it just feels great just to feel good and the movie Red eventually provides just that experience as this late summer comes to a close. There is seriousness, outlandishness, poignancy, drama, action thrills edited together in scenes that in themselves can see millions without words. This well written script has almost all of it and the difficult balance between comedy and drama is artfully and delicately put together without ripping apart the movie. With BOURNE-like precision along with the MR. AND MRS. SMITH (2005) lightness, Red brings together a multi-talented movie in a comedy-drama with an inner heart for a number of characters, even the antagonist assassin in the movie.Reminiscent of TROPIC THUNDER (2008) in its comedy-drama genre, yet with even more style, and more along the lines of Steve Carell's GET SMART (2008) yet with even more freedom to develop fresh characters that brings out the best of the all-star cast. Singular scenes and individual character performances are also echo some of the nice comedy, psychological action from THE MATADOR (2005). Perhaps the great apparent weakness or omission is the lack of great disguises used in the movie which would be assumed would be important and lacking the slick and subtle comedy drama character such as Jeff Goldblum in MR. FROST (1990). Even the comedy-family-drama of THE NANNY (2007) or FUNNY PEOPLE (2009) reflects the new delicate interplay of various movie genres that RED seems to have successfully captured.Both predictable and perhaps somewhat unpredictable, the balance between to two elements in this movie captures the best of both cinema worlds resulting in one of the most entertaining and psychologically satisfying movie of the year.</fullReview>

It's not nearly as over the top and implausible as The Expendables films. Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, James Remar, Richard Dreyfuss, and even Karl Urban are decent enough given the material (not so much for Bruce Willis and Mary Louise Parker).

		<fullReview>RED is a gem of a movie it doesn't take itself too seriously and manages to have fun and toss in a few twists and turns. The Story is: Frank Moses is a retired CIA black Ops agent and he's been retired for a few years bored and alone his highlight comes when he speaks to his pension case worker a young girl named Sarah. then a hit squad attacks him and Frank strikes back and realizes that Sarah might be in danger. Anyone who was Associated with him might be in danger so he goes off to rescue Sarah and reassemble his old team to strike back. The real joy is watching Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman and John Malokvich and Helen Mirren interact they are the movie. The story is simple and made for action it was adapted from a comic book so don't expect any brain trust here. if you came to be entertained and relax or on the edge of your seat for a couple of hours then this is the movie for you. Bruce Willis amazes me he carries this film off so effortlessly that it's educational in watching him act like he's not acting and showing you how it's done With Style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Retired Extremely Dangerous is a good action movie. It's that kinda film that you expect to see if you want to just chill and get entertained. There are some quite impressive action scenes. Also there are some quite comical scenes which make you probably smile. But that's about it. A lot eye-catching mistakes can be seen. There are many plot holes too. It's like if you are not entertained that much, all you want to ask is why- questions or 'how is that possible' questions.There are some superb actors around. Bruce Willis is good with his elegant and skilled character. He is definitely not retired. Others look solid but to see them do something totally different what we are used to see, like Helen Mirren shooting a machine gun on a party dress, is a little awkward.Nevertheless, if you are bored and you want to get entertained by a fast-paced action movie, you could give this one a go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four Words: Willis, Freeman, Malkovich, Mirren</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Red" is based on the comic book with the same name by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner staring Hollywood legends Bruce Willis (55 years of age and the man that gave the bald headed action hero its birth), Morgan Freeman (73 years of age one of the greatest Hollywood Icons of all time), John Malkovich (56 years of age and the man who have a movie named after him called "Being John Malkovich") and Helen Mirren (65 years of age and one of the literal "Queens" of Hollywood). In "Red" Willis (Frank Moses), Freeman (Joe Matheson), Malkovich (Marvin Boggs) and Mirren (Victoria) show that with age comes acting quality while playing four retired CIA agents who are targets on a hit list created to implement a top secret CIA cover up. These four retired and extremely dangerous action rule the screen when they are present melding action and comedy together. However, their star presence causes all of the other actors in the film to fall into the shadows of the screen. This results in some lackluster moments when they are not on screen. However, when four A list actors are together on one screen you can't expect less than brilliance. This is Bruce Willis's first film since "Live Free and Die Hard" that utilizes his tough guy action hero persona to the best of his ability. He is supported by one of the best casted supporting casts of all time including the aforementioned Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren. However, the performance that stands out the most in the film is that of John Malkovich with his portrayal of the crazy Marvin Boggs and his insanity. He provides many of the moments of comedic mastery with his off the wall character including the funniest scene in the film during the ending sequence. Another stand out performance came from Brian Cox (64 years of age), one of the lesser-known actors in the film that has left his mark on Hollywood on a smaller scale. In the film he plays a Russian Mob Boss named Ivan who has a romantic and comedic personality that is actually the exact opposite of what a mob boss should be. The film struggles greatly when Willis, Freeman, Malkovich and Mirren are off screen. The star power of these four hurts the performances of Mary-Louise Parker (Willis's love interest Sarah Ross) and Karl Urban (the young CIA agent William Cooper whose mission is to kill Willis and company) greatly. They are both decent actors, but are lost in the backdrop with very average and predictable performances. There are multiple scenes in the film that seem to act almost as filler because the writers could not think of a better way to occupy the time. This creates a few discontinuities that take away from the fluent flow of the story time leaving empty spaces between high energy comedy and action scenes. The last problem with the film occurs with Morgan Freemans's lack of screen time making his character seem very unimportant. If you are paying Morgan Freeman to be in a movie you need to abuse his talents!!! Director Robert Schwentke has produced a film that he knows his audience is enjoying and having fun. The entertainment value of this film is very high because of the confidence that Schwentke exudes through his filming style of "Red." He has very good reason to be confident with the cast that he has. I recommend seeing it now just to see the on screen match up of these four stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this film at the cinema and thought it looked cool and funny, and obviously the cast was a big hook, so I was looking forward to trying it, from director Robert Schwentke (Flightplan). Basically Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is retired, bored and alone, and the only entertainment he gets is when he phones government pension processing centre, when he gets to talk to his case worker Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker), who is just as bored and lonely as him, with her entertainment being talking to him and reading spy novels. Then one day Frank is attacked from his home due to the fact that his phone calls have been tapped, and he knows that it is likely that the people responsible for destroying his house will want Sarah. So he goes to find her, taking her almost against her will, but he warns her she is indeed in danger, and together they go find his old accomplices to find out what is going on, starting with some help from the Russians. After getting into the CIA HQ and his seeing his old file, he finds out he has been labelled R.E.D. - Retired and Extremely Dangerous, so now he is determined to find his comrades who are seemingly in the same predicament. His three associates are overly paranoid marksman Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich), cancer suffering Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman) and female gun expert Victoria (Dame Helen Mirren), and they all join him to go against the security forces. The main threat seems to be "agent" William Cooper (Karl Urban), and they do suffer the sacrifice of Joe, to be joined by Ivan Simanov (Brian Cox), but their main target is VP Robert Stanton (Fantastic Four's Julian McMahon). Things get complicated when Sarah is taken by the opposite side for interrogation, but in the end Frank, Marvin, Victoria and Ivan save the day and finish the job, Ivan and Victoria express their feelings, as do Frank and Sarah. Also starring Richard Dreyfuss as Alexander Dunning, Ernest Borgnine as Henry The Records Keeper and James Remar as Gabriel Singer. If your up for seeing Willis is yet another action movie, next to faces like Malkovich, Freeman, Cox and even fine British actress Mirren with guns blazing, filled with just about enough gun play and explosions, and a few alright giggles, then you won't be too disappointed with this action comedy. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Okay!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes, the mere novelty of an idea can see a movie through the entirety of its run time (for a recent example of this, see the action-star-has-been extravaganza "The Expendables"); and sometimes, the novelty falls apart well before the movie is over. For its initial hour, "Red" engenders optimism about where it will ultimately wind up: retired CIA operatives played by Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren find themselves targeted by assassins for unknown reasons. During this introductory period, we are treated to some stunning action setpieces, some amusing (if not always hilarious) character development, and some name actors doing what they do best (Willis, especially, seems to be having a blast playing a parody of the summer action hero he helped create). Director Robert Schwentke stages the action and cross-country story with a kinetic fluidity; it's a shame, then, that the film (adapted from a DC comic, believe it or not) eventually succumbs to the demands of a plot that, by the time it rolls around, feels half-baked an disposable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfunny and incoherent at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about several retired secret agents who are escaping from the CIA, as someone from the authority wants them dead."Red" is certainly over hyped. I cannot see what is so great about this film. The story telling is quite poor, with scenes incoherently pieced together, especially the scenes in the beginning. After watching it for half an hour, I still struggled to understand what's going on. As the film progresses, the plot becomes slightly clearer, but is still messy and unclear at times. It is supposed to be funny, but I do not find any scenes funny. Indeed, John Malkovich's character is annoying and over the top stupid. Helen Mirren is under utilised in the film, and she does not appear so natural in handling firearms. Julian McMahon looks far too young to be a vice president. When the characters themselves are not believable, how can one enjoy the film? I think "Red" is an unfunny, forgettable and a disappointing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie may define the term popcorn film for me. It's pure fun... pure DUMB fun but fun nonetheless. How can anyone not absolutely love the entire cast??? I'm glad I didn't see or know much about the film prior to seeing it because when actors like Brian Cox and Richard Dreyfuss started to come out of the woodwork, I just loved it. (Yes, Ernest Borgnine as well!) The ads claiming this is the best cast in light action history may be right on the mark. John Malkovich steals the show! Bruce Willis is the perfect lead and Morgan Freeman is, well, Morgan Freeman. The story flows well and the fun never stops. For the most part, check your brain at the door, sit back and have a riot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red is proof that you can't teach old dogs new tricks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Retired CIA agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) still has the moves. He survives an assassination in his own home from a group of heavily armed soldiers and takes to the road. He visits Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), a girl who writes his retirement cheques and has shared a relationship over the phone with him. When the assassins track them to her house, placing them both in danger, they reluctantly team up together. With various CIA operatives like rookie William Cooper (Karl Urban) out to kill him, Frank employs the help of his now retired team, who he suspects might be in danger too. They include Marvin (John Malkovich); a paranoid nutcase who has been subjected to too many LSD experiments; Joe (Morgan Freeman) who has liver cancer and the ageing Victoria (Helen Mirren) who is still able to wield an assault rifle. The team's investigation leads them to uncover the murder of a reporter, who was on the verge of revealing a high level conspiracy.For anyone who is bored by gun fights, broken glass and baddies with bad aim, Red (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) will be of little relevance. Truthfully, director Robert Schwentke's comic book adaptation has no pretensions about what it is. It's an all up action film, with a more exaggerated and comical tone. The humour is meant to separate this film from the rest of its action counterparts, but the dialogue is rarely witty or black enough to provide consistent laughs. With the gimmick of seeing these mature actors firing off high powered weapons aside, the action also tires quickly because the situations lack imagination. There's the inevitable car chase, the home invasion ambush, the heavily guarded break-in and even an old favourite in the 'you go on without me' scene. Making the characters older does not increase the tension of these absurd and unlikely moments either. We know so little about them and the film is so disinterested in developing character that they become almost entirely expendable. Malkovich and Mirren seem to be having the most fun here but being class actors they are hardly challenged and should have known better. Willis looks bored, presumably because he has been playing this character his entire career. The juiciest one-liners from his best work in Die Hard are absent. Most disappointingly, Morgan Freeman has just a few scenes in a movie that is well under two hours. Why couldn't some of this star power be spread over to a memorable villain too? This is the second film of its kind this year, after Knight and Day, that has forgotten the value of a great baddie. For all of the talent on show, Red is proof that you can't teach old dogs new tricks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Retired and Extremely Dangerous is what the title of this movie stand for. This cast of actors, while some are a little long in the tooth, are far from retired but their characters in this movie are certainly dangerous. While you probably can picture Bruce Willis toting a deadly machine gun can you picture Dame Helen Mirren blasting away with an up to date Kalashnilov or whatever they are called? This is what you get in this delightful fun spoof of all the shoot em up, kill lots of people, blow things up, smash cars, CIA , FBI movies that you may have seen in the past few years plus some shades of James Bond. In addition to Helen and Bruce, you have great star power from John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Mary-Louise Parker, Ernest Borgnine, Richard Dryfuss as well as excellent performances by Karl Urban, and Brain Cox. Basically the plot is that the old team has to get back together because they are all on a hit list related to some "work" they did in Guatemala 20 years ago. The plot thickens and involves the modern day CIA and maybe the Vice-President in a not such a good way. The story and the actions are completely unbelievable as they are played out, but you never know about the real secret lives of secret agents. Malkovich plays a delightful character who appears to be completely paranoid but everything that he is concerned about seems to happen with a vengeance. Lorenzo di Bonaventura, veteran movie producer, was at our screening and took us through how he put together this cast and how much fun they all seemed to have making the movie. He is hoping that older crowd will identify with the RED component and that the younger crowd will be drawn in for the action. We doubt that it will make the Oscar list but a good time can be had by all. (2010) Filmrap.net</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Can't believe my coworkers raved about this film, or that a film with this cast lineup could be so poor. Everything in this film was clichéd and forced. The plot is nonsense and the characters are undeveloped. Amazingly, the stellar cast lacks chemistry, probably because no matter how hard they might try they can't rise above this mediocre script. Only Brian Cox as a retired Russian spy and young CIA hit-man were remotely interesting. Throughout the movie, there's a sense that the director is just trying to get us all to love seeing these actors together on screen, without bothering to provide a script. As someone said, Bruce Willis, Mary Louise Parker, even John Malkovich in a stinker like this I can see. But Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman! Come on, you two are among the very best in the biz!

		<fullReview>Bruce Willis, at the age of fifty-five, who is fifteen years off from the new official retirement age, and certainly doesn't look old? takes on the burden of trying to carry on the wit that these characters are trying to do. Main problem. This movie thinks that it's a lot cooler than it actually is. It suffers from major reality pot hole glitches, but I guess that isn't much of a problem for an action movie, but whatever the case is, this movies tries to flow really fast and it's easy to keep up with it, but when you think about it, there is just a lot of stuff that quite frankly doesn't make sense. The Emmy award winning Parker who has made her career mainly off "Weeds" and "The West Wing" plays the girl that is kind of tagging along with the crew that are hardened by all the killings that they have done. Apparently she is like pure gold to Bruce, and the group is recognizing that there is a weak spot apparently in their leader. I didn't buy it. He is trying to maintain a witty cool the entire time and it didn't really work itself out that he is a caring and compassionate guy; he seems more interested in saving the girl and being the hero. The characters contrast each other so much, that it doesn't really give a variety at all; it just gives a polar opposite in situations, which instead of bringing worth more wit, it sort of just makes things unrealistic and sort of awkward.Despite its top notch cast, "Red" suffers mainly from a script that brushes over to many pot holes and develops characters that do not entirely click with each other, a lot of people will probably have a good time at it. It's not a terrible movie; it's much more of a slower paced action movie and has some good acting. It isn't your everyday ordinary action thriller film due to its embracing of charm and wit. Whatever the case, you'd have a better time renting it than paying ten bucks for it.</fullReview>

If you want to waste some time and watch a movie without having to care about characters, this is for you.

This one is not a real comedy or hardcore action flick, It's a redneck's wet dream.. though I think even rednecks have a sense of humor - and this movie just doesn't.The whole thing felt like an insult to my intelligence and a waste of time &amp; talent on the filmmakers side. Bruce Willis is a good actor. "Die Hard" had what, zero CGI and three main characters? and yet it's a thousand times more fun and action-packed than this boring flick. It's really too bad, the movie starts promising and just fails to deliver. The even sadder thing is, that this was probably done on purpose.

		<shortDescription>Red?in The Face !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know what's the worst thing about this movie ? It's the movie itself ! This is shockingly not up to its potentials. I love these stars (They chose them all top class), this formula (Old seven samurai; WAW!), but the outcome can't be more disappointing. The script is a confused little summary of never happened great action. There are many missing links. You'll ask, for all the first 2 thirds, what's the story of the murdered reporters that they're yapping about ? Hiding its facts for all that time wasn't for the sake of any thrill. We didn't even get to see their killings (????), why (Willis) got to hit (Karl Urban), the harsh CIA operative tasked in finding the leads, right in his CIA office ? So he would never do that again ! How (Freeman) knew the place of (Malkovich) and (Willis) after he got away from his killer ?? (Urban) got astonished that the CIA had archives for its agents (huh ?!). (Urban) turned into the opposite and killed his boss at the end; if that was for being afraid of (Willis)'s threat to his family, then it's damn predictable, and if it was his political faith got changed in the nick of time; then you'll never know why ! And seriously what kind of movie that doesn't show us the real evil man until the last 10 minutes? (to do absolutely nothing either !). I know. It's a weak movie, with tepid conflict. So I watched some people getting shot at, doing some things, fighting unseen enemy, for reasons we hardly understand ! The characters are so lame. For instance, the leads; what's particular about them in the first place? In a movie named (The Chronicles of Riddick) the lead, (Van Diesel), kills a man with a cup of tea, this time don't wait for something like this or remotely similar. Because while the movie brags of its so-called legendary team, I wasn't pushed to rise an eyebrow during the whole time, not saying for once "How they did this ?!". We have only 3 sequences of action (the one in the first, the fight at the CIA, and the kidnapping at last) with zero super intelligent or "Extremely Dangerous" stuff ! Remember how (Morgan Freeman) dies?! It was provocatively easy. It makes you wonder; so that's how these high profile agents act ?!! The dialog has no touchy or funny line. Not to mention being very idiot. Contemplate a moment like when (Brian Cox) is talking to (Willis) after the kidnapping of the last's girl. He says things about how crazy we become when we're in love, and recalls how his own love, (Helen Mirren), shot him in the chest once. Accordingly, what's the connection between the 2 situations for god's sake ?!! Does he mean that she was crazy in love with her country ?! Or does he refer to (Willis) to shot his own girlfriend in the chest ??!! In earlier moment, after the kidnapping itself, the supposedly wicked line that ends the scene, concerning the reuniting of the flame between this Russian man and that English lady, is said by (Willis)?? How to smile, throwing jokes, right after your love was grabbed and disappeared ??? (The character played by Malkovich, standing in the same scene, is the one who should have said it !). And it's unbelievable already, when every character says "unbelievable" every now and then !(Bruce Willis) looks more like a robot. He turned from cool into cold, reusing ALL of his reactions from his old movies again and again yet so carelessly (sometimes I noticed that he gives the wrong reactions for the scene!). He delivers what we can name as the sleepwalking version of John McClane, or his most Charles Bronson performance ever. Enough to say that watching him was soooooo boring, instead of fun ! Over and above; he plays a role that I highly doubt it was written for older person. Did you notice remarks like "he retired because he got old", or "grandpa" ?!This movie adds nothing to (John Malkovich), and he adds nothing to it either. HE DID IT FOR THE MONEYYYYYYY ! Yes, but at least it could have been entertaining along the way. His character has to be the comic relief, the nut, or let's say the older copy of The A-Team's (H.M. Murdock). However he was useless. It was pathetic to follow a fine talent like him doing that poorly poorly written material. And please, (Mary Louise Parker) deserves a Razzie, a BIG one. She has no charisma, no acting talent, no comic ability, being very annoying and silly. Maybe in another movie she would be less worse, but HERE she got to have the WORST no less !The survivors : (Brian Cox). Aside from being great actor apart, the "feelings", that his character won, made him human, consequently memorable. Somehow you can say that again about the 93-year-old (Ernest Borgnine) in his cameo as the X-files keeper, evoking the old real men-on-a-mission movies such as (The Dirty Dozen) and (The Wild Bunch). Watch how (Willis) regards him, in real passion, at one scene. Although the few action sequences weren't that great, occupying just 10 % of the movie, but thank god for them, otherwise it would have been completely unwatchable !Apparently the script did interesting first 10 minutes and last 10 minutes, while making a long dull second act in between. And as a whole it's deprived of anything new or creative. Why, in Hollywood nowadays, they give time for everything except the script? That's a deadly sin this movie suffers from and dies due to it ! The conclusion : one of the worst of its kind. And compared to its list of stars, embarrassing too. In a word?The trailer is way better !</fullReview>

I don't know why most people say Malkovich's role was so great, same it was in "Burn after reading". Actually he is not playing AT ALL! He is making some faces, but with his face its more than enough for most of people to consider it "acting". Well, this is just Malkovich, all this acting is nothing he couldn't do while shaving in the morning.

My criteria for a good movie, even of this genre, is a novel script,with unexpected twists. But that's me. I could have walked out, but did not want to insult the people who had suggested this film. Later I found out that all four of us would have been happy to leave, and the couple who suggested it was mislead by the good viewer reviews. In conclusion let me give this film two ratings. For those favoring independent films it gets a 1, while for those who like the action films I would give it a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I was hoping for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red is a 2010 action film directed by Robert Schwentke. It stars Bruce Willis who, as the title indicates, is RED, (Retired and Extremely Dangerous). Recently forced into retirement, Miller is having difficulty adjusting to the retired-life, and spends his time sitting around, watering an avocado and talking with a customer service agent named Sarah Roses (Mary-Louise Parker). Soon after the film begins, Miller comes under attack from a hit squad. This leads him to believe that Sarah is also in danger, so after fending off the attack, he packs up and goes to Kansas City to protect her. The pair hit the road and soon run into a large cast of other retirees.The most prominently featured secondary cast member is Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich). He's really the only character that Miller and Sarah run into that actually gets the screen-time they deserve. The additional characters actually make the film more entertaining, because when they aren't around, Miller and Sarah mostly just spend their time going from place to place. The action only really kicks once they recruit the ever- rotating number of characters they meet.It's really a shame that Red lacks so much in the action department, because that is the biggest thing it had going for it. Seeing good, albeit old, actors involved in crazy shootouts and other over-the-top action sequences is something that I was really hoping to see from Red. Instead, I got some mediocre actions scenes that occur only intermittently between the plot points being hammered out or scenes that attempt to be dramatic. They are too infrequent and mediocre to really be effective at keeping the audience entertained.What actually takes the most time out of the action is the film's attempt to actually explore what it would be like to go from being an action star to a retiree. Sadly, none of these scenes really add up to anything. They seem there just to kill time, and never actually explore this idea in as much depth as I had hoped.Seeing as how the majority of the actors in the film have been around for a long time, one would believe that at the very least, the acting of the film would be really good. While it isn't bad, nobody, except Willis, stood out. The characters are all fairly one-dimensional, and none of them show any real depth. They seem to always know pretty much all that is going on, and seem to hope that the action scenes would carry the entire film. When actual depth is attempted, the film falls flat. It becomes boring, and this isn't helped by mediocre acting.Even though none of the actors really made an impact on me, the film was still better when more of the actors were on the screen. The action scenes appeared to be waiting for there to be at least 3 main characters to show up before anything would happen. Bruce Willis actually does carry the majority of the film, and is the one constant throughout. The other characters come and go, seemingly at will, so you can never get used to any specific one.If there's one thing that Red does have in its favor, it's the fact that it is intermittently humorous. Some scenes, like the opener, are actually really funny. Sadly, this level of humor does not keep at a high level throughout, and ends up becoming kind of dry by the end. The times where the film is funny mostly come from Willis playing the entire thing with a straight face, while dealing with everyone else that is around him. There are certainly times where Red will make you burst out laughing, but those times are quickly replaced with boredom.Red was a film that I actually had fairly high hopes for. It was supposed to be a fairly humorous film with high-profile stars involved in exciting action scenes. The only part of that premise that really happens is that the film does have high-profile stars. It's just too bad that they aren't really given all that much to do, and what they are given isn't all that entertaining. The film does have times where it is really funny, and a couple big action scenes, but the gaps between these almost managed to make me want to fall asleep. There just isn't all that much to Red. It doesn't really explore what getting old is like, it isn't incredibly funny, and what action scenes it does have are too infrequent to actually matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you get when you cross an overly-used plot line, a few cool action sequences, big name actors, and a lot of shoot-em-up scenes? A so-so movie called Red, that's what.Saw this screening last night in Scottsdale and to its credit, will have to say that pulling off an action-comedy is certainly tough. After all, how many quality movies like Lethal Weapon, Ghostbusters, or even more recently Kiss Kiss Bang Bang can be made? So Frank Moses' (Bruce Willis) life is in jeopardy, and to protect himself and get to the bottom of it he assembles his old team- former black-ops CIA type agents who were the best at what they do- including Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), Marvin Boggs (John Malcovich), and Victoria (Helen Mirren). His would-be girlfriend, who he's never met, also gets dragged into the action. For some reason her life is now threatened as well since she and Moses have communicated so much on the phone (Sarah Ross/Mary-Louise Parker). That is quite a stretch, but you don't see this movie expecting a stirring, or even plausible, storyline! Mary-Louise Parker is pretty fun to watch throughout the film, doing one of the best jobs with the comic relief timing, along with John Malcovich, who never fails to please. Willis, Freeman, and Mirren just didn't do much for me and I can't help but blame the director for what he was trying to pull out of the actors. They had to do the best they could with what they were given. Surprising performance by Karl Urban who plays the primary law figure chasing Willis. Enjoyed watching the intensity of his character whilst rooting against in character in the hopes the Retired Extremely Dangerous (RED) clan would prevail.One of the other guys on the "hit" list is Richard Dreyfuss, who also provided an enjoyable, but still average performance.A few notable scenes that won't give away the plot - the bullet of a 357 magnum going up against an RPG "bazooka" type weapon, fight scene between Willis and Urban, a guy who we see get blown to bits literally, Willis step gracefully out of a car doing a 360, Willis putting Parker's contact lens in his eye, Malcovich running after the police with a bomb strapped to him, Willis breaking into a highly secure room by kicking in the flabby wall next to the entrance door, etc Overall I felt the movie just tried too hard to be funny and several of the scenes are just plain uninteresting, but I had a good time as 12 of my friends joined me to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I was hoping you'd have hair . . ." Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) We know Bruce Willis doesn't have hair, but like his reluctant companion, Sarah, on a picaresque around America, we think he's cool because of the lack. And so Red goes, a comedy-adventure about the CIA pursuing one of its retired agents, Frank Moses (Willis), who needs to consult with old friends to find out why he's a target.A slick comic-book adaptation, Red (Retired: Extremely Dangerous) carries off its satire of the action genre with spot-on casting and never a moment of taking itself seriously. Not that I ever doubted Willis can't handle a younger partner (see Moonlighting) as he does here with Parker in one of the year's best pairings, superior to the also reluctant Cameron Diaz with Tom Cruise in the similar Knight and Day, which had Cruise as a rogue operative and Diaz as the potential romantic partner. Willis and Parker are just more relaxed about the violence and love mix.It's the supporting cast that makes this movie so much fun, from a gun-toting ex-assassin played by ever-attractive Helen Mirren to a sodden Russian mobster played with relish by Brian Cox, but not to neglect Richard Dreyfuss as another heavy with a light touch. All are having fun (Ernest Borgnine makes an appearance as well), adding to the growing thesis that aging stars still are as bright as ever, and maybe brighter than the younger crop of hyper Bournes and Bonds.More than one critic has labeled the Expendables, Gran Torino, Bucket List, et.al. as geri-actioners, and I like the tag</fullReview>

Mary-Louise Parker joins them on their adventure as a mandatory romantic interest, given little to do other than a variation of her airhead character from "Weeds," and there are nice supporting roles from veteran actors such as Richard Dreyfuss and Ernest Borgnine, the latter of the two being 90 years old and still going strong.Rising star Karl Urban is the semi-villain of the film, a government agent trying to chase Willis and his gang down before they assassinate a political figure (for reasons I won't spoil), and his is probably the least predictable character; he's introduced early on as a straightforward baddie and you think you can expect what might happen to him, but he takes a more sympathetic turn halfway through the picture.The cast has a lot of fun with the material -- Malkovich in particular, who chews up the scenery with gusto as an agent that was fed daily doses of LSD for years and has completely lost his mind -- and the movie sets itself up nicely for a sequel, but it's not really necessary. This is ultimately a been-there, done-that action film that is probably a little too pleased with itself at times, never quite as fresh or stylish as it thinks it is, but it brings enough to the table -- and has a solid enough cast to back it up -- that it's worth the time. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have read down this far in the review list, then you know the plot. Frank (Bruce Willis) is getting the old spies together to take down the bad guys. The plot is a rehash of a dozen movies like A-Team and Rambo III where old guys get together and fight for justice. This version kept moving, and the support cast was strong including Mary-Louise Parker, John Malkovich, Richard Dreyfus, and especially Helen Mirren. Helen delivered some great lines that were fun to watch, sadly she was not in the movie that much. RED worked as a movie, and I enjoyed watching it. Head tough-guy Bruce Willis is not interesting or likable enough, and he is the weak point of the movie. I'd like to have seen a dozen other actors. Bruce is bald, just like the cartoon character, but he is not really a very good action hero. I liked paranoid Marvin's (John Malkovich) paranoid rants that turned out to be just what the NSA was doing -- in terms of their listening to them and tracking them.The special effects were solid; they didn't achieve splashy. I did not care for the post card motif -- perhaps this is borrowed from the comic book. The end of the movie was pretty clever, and I liked that. I give this movie an average rating, so it is a five. Bruce Willis fans might give it a seven. More: I love Helen Mirren with a machine gun. She was the best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Halfway between comedy and action but doesn't quite work well as either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red isn't as great as the positive reviews its been getting. Its really not that funny in the comedy part and the action scenes aren't that impressive. Some cool fight scenes but not that many. The scenes have been done many times before and have done better. With a talented cast, I expected the film to be much better, and I was disappointed. The main problem with the film is that it tried too hard to be hip but fails considering the age's of the main cast. There were many jokes and gags that failed and that simply were not funny. The romance was also cheesy.The characters weren't that great. Though the only saving grace here is John Malkovich, who steals every scene and is really quite funny. Same with Mary-Louise Parker, she performed well and was the most intriguing and careful character IMO. Bruce Willis as Frank is, well Willis, not a stretch- seen him done the same role a few times now. The negatives are Helen Mirren, though looks excellent for her age, doesn't make her role feel realistic enough (she's 65 firing machine guns/cursing), it seemed too fake and her attitude was really annoying. In the third act when she becomes a presence the film goes downhill. Morgan Freeman is really criminally underused, and Karl Urban is quite talented and is becoming very versatile but wasn't that convincing as the lead villain. All in all, don't expect anything original, or good. It's not terrible, just below average, and should have been much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An evil film which should never have been made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a deeply immoral film and everyone associated with it should be ashamed. The film goes far beyond the trivialization of murder to encompass also the trivialization of psychopathic murderers themselves. Four internationally famous film stars of a certain age have come together in this film to disgrace themselves and retrospectively damage their lifelong reputations by their appalling antics. John Malkovich, who has done such fine work in the past, here makes a complete ass of himself attempting unsuccessfully to be funny while playing a paranoid psychopathic killer. Ha. Ha. If Malkovich is that much of an insipid fool, then we must reevaluate his entire life's work. And then there is Helen Mirren. Carried away by her own vanity, one presumes, she thinks it cute to smirk and make wry smiles and witty asides while confessing eagerly that she simply can't stop killing people. Titter, titter, isn't she just the cutest thing? Now we turn to Morgan Freeman. How can a person of his supposed stature possibly lend his name and talent to this toxic soup of cutesy cutesy psychopathic killers? Does Freeman think he, like his vain and heedless colleagues, is also being ever so amusing? Does he too wish to start a new career as a stand-up comedian? I have heard glowing reports of him for years from some of my best friends who are close friends of his: he is such a fine man, what a wonderful fellow. Well, I can now discount all of that, as it all goes into the trash can. They can say what they like, but the evidence is before us, and that speaks louder than words. And this brings us to the mumbling, bumbling Bruce Willis. He does this sort of relentless killer thing all the time, so we expect nothing less of him. He, like Nick Nolte and countless others, evidently thinks he is Marlon Brando. That is why he mumbles and whispers all the time, so that only about half of what he says is audible. Idiot actors like Willis believe that mumbling 'draws the audience in' and makes them pay more attention to the empty, vacuous ego who mumbles. Yes, Willis, down boy, down boy! Producers know very well that when the hero mumbles incoherently in an action movie it doesn't matter, because nobody is listening to the words anyway, they are just waiting for the explosions and the gunfire and the screams. Who wants to hear what Bruce Willis is saying when he is busy shooting people and blowing things up? The dialogue in the script means nothing in such circumstances. Screenwriters are pointless vestigial organs to an action movie production: their dialogue is largely ignored, except for the odd sound bite to steer the audience through a cut or a transition of scenes. This film, like so many other Hollywood action movie monstrosities, is like a computer game. Bang bang bang. Boom boom boom. Flash flash flash. The aim is to kill as many people as possible and 'score'. The aim is also to blow up as many things as possible. Retard adolescents who spend their lives killing people on small screens like to have bigger and bigger explosions, and Hollywood action movies carry this over onto bigger screens, and with even bigger explosions. The more people who get killed and the more things that get blown up, and the bigger and more grandiose the explosions, the 'better' the action movie. And if John Malkovich can behave like a jibbering monkey and be the unfunniest funny man in the history of comic books, well that is meant to be really something too, especially if, as in this film, he lives in an underground bunker which resembles the hideaway of a psychopathic teenaged computer nerd. For this film is quintessentially adolescent, and makes no pretence at embodying even the slightest flicker of either intelligence or conscience. I see that the film's director Robert Schwentke is currently making a film based on a comic book. Well, that sounds about right for him. But I wonder if he can read it? Is he that advanced? This film is based on 'a graphic novel' which presumably had no words and just pictures. That too figures. Such is the level of illiteracy in Hollywood today, that the 'books' on which films are based are now either without words or with mere comic balloons. The lunatics have finally fully and totally taken over the asylum, and they are all illiterate baboons. Today I got an email add from amazon.com advertising the DVD of the film RED with the catchline: 'Are you looking for something in our Comedy DVD department?' Well, what does that tell us? It is confirmation that the glorification of psychopathic murderers is now officially classed as comedy, and is desperately, uproariously funny. So funny is it in fact that all the world's genuine victims of psychopathic killers can be presumed to have been not murdered at all, but must really have died laughing. Yes, the next time a madman rapes and kills an unfortunate girl, that is comedy. All the people dying in Libya because of the psychopathic Gaddafi are really laughing themselves to death, with Helen Mirren wryly smiling and with that hungry killer's glint in her eye. Maybe Mirren, Freeman, Willis, and Monkeyvich should all go to Libya and help Gaddafi's African mercenaries murder people in the streets. Maybe they would be at home in that environment, and they could crack jokes with each other about it, making cute little smiles and wry glances at one another and could say every time a body falls in the street: 'I feel so good at being back at actively killing again, as I have missed it so much.' And Monkeyvich could make apish faces as the court jester of the madman Gaddafi, while Mirren, Willis, and Freeman laugh heartily at how wonderfully exciting it all is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than I expected, worse than what it could have been...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of my review says it all. Bruce Willis starts in another mediocre movie. This time seems to be the typical corporate espionage type of movie, of course mixed up with comedy, hilarious action scenes, undeveloped but ridiculous characters and the last but not the least... a crappy story for a fun-to-watch movie. This movie is entertaining but at the same time it could have been much more than that. This movie could have been a little bit smarter, wiser and why not funnier. The story itself is pretty much the same. CIA agents trapped in some "conspiracy" thing, they try to take the matter in their own hands and solve the problem, they succeed and the guy gets the girl. Nothing new. What I was impressed though was the delivery of those key moments in a movie which were timed very good to keep the audience interested in the movie.As for the casting, Bruce Willis did what he always does being the character-actor he is, but Bruce was not the guy who stole the show. John Malkovich takes that easily. Each scene he's in was hilarious and the way he played (again a typical JM character) that agent was fun to watch. The dialogue was pretty good, there were some very good jokes but every now and then you got the cheesy one that made you go from "ha-ha-ha" to "hm-hm-hm". The rest of the cast was OK, nothing being good nor bad even though I just couldn't find Mary-Louise Parker attractive and fit for her role but maybe that's just me. As for the action-scenes, there were some (many?) of them which were screaming for attention and hilarity but at the end I guess you could get over it since this movie is not meant to be taken seriously. I could name this movie as being "The Losers Meets Burn After Reading" because, in fact, this movie has the stupid action scenes from The Losers, the crappy story from the Losers and it also has the delivery from Burn After Reading and the thin humor.As far the technical part, the editing was the stand-out, the music was so and so, started good turned bad getting better turned worse and so on, the cinematography was pretty much average and one thing irritated me so bad: those postcard crossovers between the cities. I mean, it looked so lame from my point of view and the ending was just "mehhh"... but then again that's maybe just me.The final take on this movie is that it's a entertaining movie where you don't need to pay attention to the story too much. This is easily a matinée or a rental (as the guys from spill would say) I recommend it for anyone who is lazy and wants just to watch something fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Red" is a dreadful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Red" was a dreadful film, with off-hand references to an attempted assassination of an American vice-president by a Russian member of the merry band of assassins. He expressed his wistful wish that he had always "dreamed of assassinating an American president"! The hotel kitchen scene during the group's attempt to assassinate the vice-president was horribly reminiscent of Robert Kennedy's assassination. Helen Mirren was charming, but she slid by on her looks &amp; elegant accent. Mary Louise Parker brought the right amount of apprehension &amp; delight at exciting,exotic new experiences. The gratuitous violence really was reprehensible. I felt ashamed for having contributed money toward this movie's success. I went to see it because friends chose it, but I should have relied on my own reservations about the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red Is Not My Favorite Color</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red(2010)Thank goodness for sneak previews. You'll know why.RED is from a D.C. comics graphic novel about a group of former operatives that are now retired and taking it easy. I have been very fickle about graphic novel adaptations with Sin City being the only standout, as Sin City that also had Bruce Willis, really worked. Can't say the same thing for RED.RED is pretty much your redundant run-of-the-mill action flick that has a unoriginal plot, slick action, and hot and cold comedy. Bruce Willis is the lead man Frank Moses who is suddenly is a target for unknown reasons and is ridiculously unstoppable. Makes me wonder why he even retired despite age. He goes on a mission to find out why he is a target and you could almost recite the rest of this movie as it has action movie clichés:Conspiracy, check. The sharp weirdo, check. A pointless character,(or two) check. The one committed to his job, check. Cliché villains, check. Lack of time-frame, or sleep, check.The only saving grace here is John Malkovich, who steals every scene and is really quite funny. Willis is, well Willis, not a stretch. Helen Mirren, who looks excellent for her age, is fine here for a change of role, Freeman is really criminally underused, and Karl Urban is quite talented and is becoming very versatile.The action is rather slick and is none too loud enough or too low as well. If you like explosions, this is for you. Seriously, some action scenes here were quite good, other scenes were like watching a video game.All in all, don't expect anything original, or good. It's not terrible, just below average.Because of the sneak preview, at least this was free.</fullReview>
