		<shortDescription>Undervalued a decade ago, this film is better than Eastwood's other heralded directorial efforts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do not confuse any of the archived reviews by national critics labeling this movie as "mediocre" and merely "watchable" as accurate statements. This movie is one of Eastwood's most interesting and controlled efforts behind the camera. There is less blatant scenery chewing in "A Perfect World" than contained in Eastwood's unduly praised "Mystic River." And although "Unforgiven" brought Eastwood an Oscar, "A Perfect World" is much more effective in its employment of Eastwood's usual methodical pacing and his ability create empathy for men who are "bad, but not the worst" of society.For those that are not Costner-philes, this is one of the few movies that viewers should be unable to find ways to deride Costner as an actor. Costner's performance as Butch is by far the best of his career. Actually, it would be better to note that his performance is nomination worthy (er... was) simply for the fact that I know many people view Costner as a flat actor that is not really on par with other actors of his generation. The scenes between Costner and his young costar are extremely interesting. Butch is given almost all the dialogue because eight-year-old Phillip is more or less a pupil of Butch's (or surrogate son if one thinks of the blatant implications); thus, this movie almost entirely belongs to Costner and the development of his character and he does a pitch perfect job.The movie itself has some simplicities in its other characters, such as Eastwood's Ranger, Dern's criminologist, and the gaggle of law enforcement personal tracking Costner's character. John Lee Hancock's script is not the strongest when focusing in on their additions to the narrative. Plus there are some overly simplistic social commentaries on the role of the penal system, but those are far outweighed by the mass of the film. And Eastwood works around the few weaknesses of the script much better than he did in Hancock's adaptation of "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil."Considering that Eastwood is a competent director who has created mostly middling works or has been praised for efforts that are far exceeded by the scripts themselves, such as "Unforgiven" and "Mystic River," "A Perfect World" is quite a good film. Also of note is the cinematography and framing of all the shots. Almost all of Eastwood's films, regardless of the shot and lighting conventions of the genres in which he has worked, are terribly sloppy and poor in their presentation. Jack N. Green has been his longtime cinematographer of choice; therefore, it is not as if a new voice was thrown into the mix adding to the success of this film visually in comparison with Eastwood's other works. Nonetheless, Eastwood succeeds in much of his direction in this film andCostner's performance makes this film a nice little gem that was undervalued a decade ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ONE OF THE BEST IN 1993</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And certainly one of the most underrated pictures on IMDB. Why? Beats me, since this is one of the best performances from Costner &amp; Eastwood. Not to mention the others.Maybe it's the movie a little bit slow at start, but soon we get too see a strong character development, what leads us to the grand finale, where we cheer for the outlaw and his little "partner" (also very good performance by T.J. Lowther). The ending is undoubtedly one of the most touching in the history of cinema.All in all, Costner did great both as director and actor and he had a winning hand picking up co-actors and screen &amp; music writers. Plus, he made this movie in the nineties era, one of the best, if not the best for Hollywood movies. That's for it's just pure classic. Just like the Texas landscape where it was taken.9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect World Is Perfectly Watchable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some aspects of this film work better than others, but overall A PERFECT WORLD is a highly watchable film. Kevin Costner delivers a fine performance as escaped convict Butch Haynes. The film primarily focuses on the relationship between Haynes and an innocent 8 year old boy named Phillip whom he kidnaps and befriends (well played by TJ Lowther). Haynes has killed two people thus far and gives the impression of a being a loose cannon, but Eastwood evokes sympathy for the character as the audience learns about Haynes troubled childhood (raised without a father by a prostitute mother - killed a man by the age of 8) and observe his genuine care and concern for the boy. Their relationship is reminiscent of Allan Ladd and the young boy in SHANE. As he slowly feeds us more information about Hayne's history, and lets the audience wrestle with its ambivalent feelings towards Costner's character, Eastwood keeps the film moving with lots of close brushes with the law, car chases and shoot'em ups.Where the film doesn't work quite is when Eastwood himself is in front of the camera, playing a minor role - Chief Red Garnett - a Texas Ranger who's in charge of Haynes' capture. The primary function of his character, and Laura Dern's (who plays Sally Gerber - a criminologist the Governor forces upon the Chief) in the script is to supply further information about Haynes' past. Unfortunately, Eastwood tries to flesh out the relationship between these characters through antagonistic chauvinist attitudes towards Gerber and creating a power struggle between the two which (big surprise!) over the course of the film, gradually leads to a mutual respect between them! Granted Eastwood and Dern have marquee value - especially Eastwood, are fine in their roles, and, of course, chauvinism was alive and well in 1960's Texas, but I mostly found these minor subplots annoying and unnecessary. It's the scenes and issues focusing on Costner's character that are the life blood of this picture. This criticism aside, Eastwood does a solid job directing, weaving action, suspense and thought provoking human drama into a well knit weave and Costner delivers one of the best acting performances of his career.7 1/2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All you Kevin Costner haters out there, WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Costner's career has been in a downward spiral (to say the least) over recent years. Now it seems like even people who admired him at first are suddenly forfeiting their compliments and jumping on the bandwagon, along with the rest of the Costner haters. Well, I'm not gonna jump on that bandwagon. This movie is sheer proof that Costner is a wonderful actor capable of playing characters of multiple dimensions. Here, he's given the challenge of playing a likable villain, without having us forget that he has criminal tendencies. I'm not condoning criminals, but do you honestly think every criminal in the world is a cold-blooded motherf***er with not a single scruple? They're human beings like everyone else, only they choose to live dishonest lives. In other words, the easy way out--at least that's what they think. Costner played a completely one-dimensional villain in "3,000 Miles to Graceland," but it was fitting to the tone of that film, which plays out like a comic book fantasy. His character of Butch is much more realistic, and his main scruple is treating children like dirt. He himself was treated like dirt as a child, and whenever he sees mothers or fathers do the same to their children, he goes nuts and sometimes homicidal. A very interesting character, which Costner plays to absolute perfection. I have a theory about movies. Whenever you have an adult story (excluding children's and family-oriented material) involving a child in a major role, the movie often turns out either good or great. This one turned out great. Good movies come more often than you think. Great movies don't come quite that often. A real motion picture experience is when you get lost in the story to the point where you feel you're right there with the characters, and not sitting on your couch watching these characters on a TV screen. This is one of those experiences. The film is totally character-driven, which also appeals to me. It took me a journey through the lives of Butch and the young boy. I felt a deep connection to each of them. The ending had me pouring with tears. I have to give it up for Clint Eastwood, who usually scores behind and in front of the camera. The film runs a little over 2 hours, but when you have solid characters like these the time flies by in a snap. Hell, "Corky Romano" was under 90 minutes long and I may as well as have been watching it for 10 hours. The most powerful scene, in my opinion, is when Butch and the boy stay over the home of the black slave. Butch sees the way the father physically abuses his son, and goes to the extent of tying him down to a couch. He then forces the father to say "I love you" to his son, like he really means it. "A Perfect World" is a film I'll never forget, and I'm so damn glad I spent my 14.99 to purchase the DVD. I have only one very minor complaint: the guy who plays Philip overacts like crazy in a cartoonish performance. My score: 9 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the grandson of "Hunted"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1952, Charles Crichton had produced a successful suspenseful movie with a derivative premise: a man (an excellent Dirk Bogarde) compelled to take a brat hostage with him because he was the witness of his murder and to flee with him across Britain to escape the police. This journey had brought the two runaways together and Bogarde eventually felt real love and care for his young hostage. Crichton (I find it hard to believe that it's the same man who 36 years later will cook "a Fish Called Wanda", 1988!) had construed his topic with a lot of reserve and sensitivity which bestowed his wonderful piece of work with pathos and tenderness.40 years later, Clint Eastwood, freshly showered with praise for his dusky "Unforgiven" (1992) takes back this formula for a flick which basically was to be directed by Steven Spielberg but the latter had a lot to do with "Schindler's List" (1994), probably his finest moment. The amount was "a Perfect World" (1993) and it deserves better than the lukewarm reviews it received and stands as a winner in Eastwood's eclectic filmography. In spite of a few installments in its second part that one can deem as overlong, it has enough commendable stuff to grab the audience.First, Eastwood's vehicle is helped by the work of John Lee Hancock who 4 years later will pen the scenario for another Eastwood flick: "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" (1997). Because it eschews the formulaic ingredients of the movie genre, "a Perfect World" deals with and it encompasses various tones: from the droll moments Kevin Costner goes through with his young hostage to gripping scenes which incommodes the audience (the scene when Costner holds the black family in their living room with a song he hadn't heard for years), the script takes the viewer by surprise. It's true that suspense takes a back seat during most of the viewing but Eastwood's flick has other stuff in store. In the favorable reviews, it has been said that the relationships between Costner and his young partner were highly interesting. From their first confrontation, Costner has an evident interest in the little boy, a nagging curiosity that will grow throughout his run. In this way, his attitude, at least in the outset of the film is quite different from Bogarde's. The latter realizing that he has no other choice to take his brat with him expresses at first hostility and scorn before starting to get interested in him. Not Costner who is clearly interested with his hostage from the outset and for whom he feels affection. In the two flicks, the little boys may see in Bogarde and Costner the father figures they never had. Their households are characterized by an absence of father. As for Costner, he unveils to his partner, scraps of his anterior life which might explain one of his attitudes towards him. Maybe, he tries to play his role of father and this way to get close to him: "we have a lot of things in common you and me: we love Coke, we never had father". He wants to make him discover a new life, a freer and more maverick one in which anything goes (he asks him to write the things he craves to do).Nature plays a momentum role in "a Perfect World": it surrounds the characters and is of a vivacious green which symbolizes bliss and hope. In this perfect world, the two main protagonists try to search for support, friendship, bliss but impending danger waits around the corner.Eastwood's flick was also decried because the other sequences of the film in which Eastwood and his crew appear were rather weak. I don't think so. True the character of Laura Dern is a little formulaic but in one sequence the most important members offer their vision of a perfect world. And even if here he doesn't hold the main role, Clint Eastwood has a prime secondary part. The cast is a major asset of the film. The little boy is directed with care and respect and Eastwood gave Costner his last great hour, given the duds in which he acted afterward: the horrible "Waterworld" (1995), a waste of money and time and the insipid "Postman" (1997).Coming after a pinnacle in his career, "Unforgiven", I feel that Eastwood wasn't hampered by this critical and commercial triumph and broke new ground in the fugitive movie with this startling piece of work. Give this movie a chance. It deserves it. And if you have the chance to see "Hunted", don't think twice. Eastwood's flick compares favorably with its 40 year old model. And after the projection, try to ask yourself this question: what is a perfect world?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want a fast-paced philosophical drama with quite possibly the saddest ending to a movie you've ever seen, then this is the film for you... A Perfect World drains you emotionally and that's why this amazing film is worth watching once, and not over and over again.You can't go wrong with a movie directed by Clint Eastwood, who also plays the U.S. Marshal. Kevin Costner gives the greatest performance of his career (except for maybe JFK) and the little boy is played impressively by 7-year-old T.J Lowther. What makes A Perfect World so great is that it's got flaws, but still manages to hold you glued to your TV and make you not want to miss a thing. Be ready to laugh, cry and ponder upon what life would be if we lived in a perfect world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An average story made good by quality acting. Kevin Costner turned in one of his best performances. Just as his character would start to win you over because of his positive interactions with the boy, he'd do something awful and remind you that he's really a bad guy and that he'd taken the boy hostage. So even though he's a criminal, he's got a good side and obviously his bad upbringing took him down the wrong path in life. I though TJ Lowther was also excellent as the boy and was very believable. On the other side is Clint Eastwood as the tough law man who cares more about catching his criminal than making his bosses happy. And last, but not least, Laura Dern was also very good as Clint's cohort in catching the bad guy. While Clint relies on his years of experience, she comes from the psychological side and what she's read in books. They often disagree, but there is a mutual respect between them even if they don't show it. There are enough light moments to keep this otherwise serious movie from being a turn off.*** (Out of 4)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waltz Across Texas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An intelligent and resourceful prison escapee named Butch Haynes (Kevin Costner) takes an eight-year-old boy (T.J. Lowther) hostage, as Haynes roams across Texas in the early 1960s. Meanwhile, the authorities, headed by a Texas Ranger (Clint Eastwood), set out to capture Haynes, in an Airstream trailer.Costner does a fine job as Haynes, an interesting character who happens to like waltz music. Lowther is equally good in his role, a boy who comes from a family whose religious beliefs are quite strict. On their sojourn, the boy acquires, and sometimes wears, a Casper-the-friendly-ghost mask, a symbol of childhood innocence that contrasts nicely with the seriousness of a dangerous hostage situation.The relationship between Haynes and the kid evolves into a kind of father-son union, wherein Haynes does most of the talking, and the kid reacts, usually with clever, nonverbal expressions. It's a good acting arrangement that plays up the strengths of both actors. It's the best element of the film.Throughout their odyssey, a collection of oldies pop songs helps to capture the early 1960's era, though I could have wished that the volume had been turned up. Haynes' goal is Alaska, but he doesn't quite get there, and the film ends much more interestingly than it began.The main problem with the film is the plot. It gets off to a hokey, contrived start. And, throughout the film, the law enforcement component does not work at all. It comes across as stereotyped, irritating, unnecessary, and it is not funny despite attempts to make it funny. You get the feeling you're watching reruns of "The Dukes Of Hazard", especially with that corny trailer.Even so, the film is worth watching, for the acting accomplishments of Costner and Lowther, and for the interesting dialogue that takes place between their two characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect World; An Idealistic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent movies have everything right with them - from the scenery to the director. This movie has it all except the plot is too idealistic for my taste. Granted a story can have any plot the author decides, but this one plays on false stereotypes just like other Hollywood movies, e.g. the "noble" savage. (There is no such thing - individuals may be noble, but not an entire nation. This is why "To Kill a Mocking Bird" is so powerful - the main noble character is surrounded by real people - at least as real as a movie will allow them to be.) And so it doesn't go with "A Perfect World." The main character is surrounded by louts brutes and ignoramuses.However, was the movie entertaining? Was it well directed, cast, acted, and lit? You bet. One of Mr. Eastwood's best. 10/10.-Zafoid</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Costner and Eastwood confront each other in A Perfect World with a very ordinarily written cat and rat movie. We've seen the same plot many times before and after 1993. Eastwood plays the cat, and Costner does the rat. However, Eastwood directs it at a high emotional level; giving its viewers much inspiration of love and joy, offering a great deal of fun and humour, especially pointing the importance of family. To the effect that, the title should have been "A PERFECT FAMILY" or "A PERFECT FATHER". I'm sure though, Eastwood must have considered these options of titling the movie. If he chose to go with "A PERFECT WORLD"; for me, it means that even a shifty criminal man can raise a child better than a moralist bona fide housekeeper can, at some point.The story takes place in 1960s' Texas. Butch(Costner) is an escaped convict out of a perforce criminal. After he and his partner escape from prison, they begin to outlaw the law. As a celebration of their freedom, they supersede their own law of crime. They first planned to escape to Mexico, but the plans changed when they kidnapped a 8 year old boy. Butch's partner doesn't like the boy as he likes. So they break with each other, and Butch stays with the boy. When the Texas police are alerted of the kidnapping, police chief Garnett(Eastwood) and his officers start to chase Butch to rescue the boy. Whereas, the boy finds Butch close to him both as a hero in his dreams and as a father in his heart. The time when Butch takes the boy to buy him new clothes, which he chose to wear Casper costume, Butch names the kid Buzz. Butch wants him to be happy for he has never had the chance to be before; and Buzz turns out to be cheery as he found a daemon turning his wishes into reality. Together they formed a legendary couple like Bonnie&amp;Clyde, like Thelma&amp;Louise and the same bottom line was awaiting for them as Bonnie&amp;Clyde, as Thelma&amp;Louise.A Perfect World is truly an Eastwood classic. His style of script, his style of action, his style of simplicity and the love of the guns for sure loom large. Fundamentally like every Eastwood movie out of A Perfect World we obtain an opinion. So we never regret seeing A Perfect World for one time. This would be a good choice to watch with your whole family together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(many spoilers!!!!)I just saw this movie today, and was impressed. I know I should've seen it earlier, but I missed it every time it was on TV. "A Perfect World", with Kevin Costner and Clint Eastwood tells the story of the fugitive convict Butch Haynes, who escapes with his partner Terry Pugh from the Huntsville prison in 1963. On their flight, they kidnap the young 8-year-old-boy Phillip Perry, and continue their race across Texas. As Pugh tries to abuse Phillip, Butch kills him. While Texas Ranger Chief Red Garnett (Eastwood) hunts them, the two discover similar bonds, and Butch really comes to like young Phillip. The boy himself overcomes his suspicion and accepts Butch as a kind of "older brother", or even stronger, as the compensation for his father, whom he never knew. As the hunt continues, Butch tells Phillip about his life, and his wish to find his own father on Alaska, where he would like to live in peace and dignity. They make certain stops, steal three different cars, and survive confrontations with the local cops. The movie deals not only with this flight of a criminal, but also strongly with the issues of fathers and sons. That's what put this movie for me above the usual road movie. It goes deep, deals with exhaustion, love, hopelessness, and pure human emotions. The climax of the movie is unexpected. Butch and Phillip stay on a farm, when the situation gets out of control. The farmer beats his young son, and Butch attacks him, even threatens to kill him. That's what causes Phillip to raise the gun against Butch, and even shoots him in the stomach.Garnett reaches the place. Butch stumbles out of the farm and follows Phillip, who sought for refuge on a big tree. Police forces surround them, snipers get into positions. But Phillip is not willing to leave Butch, though he would have let him go to his mom, who also arrived at the scenery. He runs back to the wounded Butch and hugs him. There you can see the love and sympathy the boy feels for the "criminal". I was caught in high attention, unable to move. How would the movie end? Criminologist Sally Gerber is with Garnett, and both of them know, really know Butch, Garnett even knows him from his childhood in Amarillo on. They try to solve the situation peacefully. But when Phillip and Butch move towards Garnett, hand in hand, Butch stumbles again, and tries to give the photograph of Alaska, which his father sent him, to Phillip. The sniper, an arrogant FBI agent, supposes Butch would draw a gun and fires a shot into the chest of the man. He dies, Phillip kneeing on his side, taking the photo and eventually, his mom draws him away from Butch. Garnett is angry. He wanted to save the guy, for he knew the good heart of Haynes. The dramatic ending is impressive. Eastwood made a perfect job both as actor and director, and T.J. Lowther's performance as young Phillip is simply great and convincing. One of Costner's best as well, a road movie with funny dialogues, a thrilling background story, moving emotions, brilliant acting performances, some brutal and unexpected scenes, a great setting in Texas around 1963, and an indeed amazing climax at the end, which makes the movie a dramatic masterpiece.Feel free to respond and to share your thoughts, you can write me if you want.Best greetings to all imdb.com users from Austria!</fullReview>

He's always good as baseball players and cowboys, but this character is really a perfect fit for Costner. Combines all the elements that add up to a great Costner performance: humor (Crash Davis from Bull Durham)+ dark violence seething under the surface (Charly from Open Range)+ Child-like enthusiasm (Ray Cansella from Field of Dreams). Severely underrated, A Perfect World stands right up there Eastwood's best behind the camera achievements.

		<shortDescription>"All things considered, I feel pretty good".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the relatively recent string of directorial hits from Clint Eastwood, it's easy to forget about this rough cut gem from 1993 in which Eastwood also has a supporting role. "A Perfect World" takes one through an entire range of human emotion while focusing on a hostage situation in progress. Kevin Costner plays against type as a small time hood who kidnaps an eight year old boy with his partner, and then dispatches the partner when it appears he may have tried to abuse the youngster. Reaching back into his own troubled past, Butch Haynes (Costner), over the course of the picture, attempts to provide his ward Phillip (T.J. Lowther) with the type of surrogate fatherhood that both have lacked in their respective lives.What makes the story so compelling is the way Butch takes Phillip under his wing as the story progresses. At all times, Butch is a straight shooter, he tells Phillip the truth about the boy's father never coming back and how his mother's lying about it. At an age where he instinctively knows this to be true, Phillip comes to respect and trust the man who in every other respect is a frightening criminal. The telling moment is when Butch takes the boy 'trick or treating', and Phillip makes repeated attempts to hold his hand until Butch relents. That single moment captured the essence of a relationship that was about to turn horribly bad.This is one picture for certain that doesn't fall into convention, where you can see the end coming from a mile away. In the split second during the scene when Butch terrorizes the black family, you don't have enough time to reflect on whether Phillip will actually pull the trigger or not, and then BAM! - it's an entirely different story. As with many pictures though, the dramatic ending leaves a lot more questions than answers. For example, what about the trauma Phillip is likely to suffer for his role in helping to capture and kill Butch? Whisking him away in an emergency helicopter doesn't resolve that whole issue, much as we like to see our pictures tied up into a nice neat bundle.Anyway, this is a compelling story that isn't afraid to bring it's viewers 'outside the box' of traditional movie fare. It forces one to think about the nature of good and evil, and how they can exist in the same person. It's a movie that you won't easily forget the day after you saw it as is the case with so many pictures relying on shoot 'em up action and a clear cut victory for the good guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best cinema in the film more forgotten Eastwood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Butch Haynes" (Kevin Kostner) is a dangerous and intelligent killer that has escaped from prison in the company of another prisoner. During the flight both taken hostage to Philip, a child of six years, a member of a large, strict and religious family, living his abduction as a thrilling adventure. The abducted child with the which will begin a long trip, it is interpreted exceptionally by T. J. Lowther. Clint Eastwood is responsible for search to Kevin Costner and is Clint who leave the phrases funniest movie although there are also to see the extraordinary expression of his face at the end of the film. It is a "road movie", in which the fugitive and abducted child identifies each other and end up becoming "accomplices". The dialogs are very smart, and improve further with the interpretations. The script is very good, apart from that is well developed, succeeding in addition to good dialogs, a relationship moving between the abductor and the abducted child. Clint used a very smart have several parallel stories to go alternating, is a very skillful to explain the children of the fugitive, hence the justification for the character of "Laura Dern", the only one to know the last of the fugitives.In this movie we see a Kevin Costner in the late 1980 and early 1990 in where it has a good handful of movies extremely interesting, among them that i am commenting. Eastwood hit by giving the main role to a Kevin Costner inspired, the level of his best interpretations as "JFK".But perhaps was the pace that Eastwood gave the film, the excellent performances, with special mention of the young Lowther, music and, of course, the great history that account the script, excellently writing. The final part of thematic dark but luminous photography, is wonderful. The scenes are very achieved, there are some very good, and then there is the final is really incredible, emotional, hard and cruel.A perfect world is the film more forgotten Eastwood, is forgotten many times in reviewing the career of Clint, but we are amazed every time you see, and a Kevin Costner extraordinary, as he had never been seen, gives us perhaps the best interpretation of his career cinematographic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my one of the favorite and unforgettable films.The story,the pictures,emotion are very impressive.For me,this film is valuable because, it has got a humane message in the name of friendship,crime and innocence.Mastery of Eastwood's telling story appears with images,dialogs and music.The casting is very good and natural.Kevin Costner and little supporter actor fit their roles.Maybe,some people can think for this film that is over-emotional and artificial.But I do not agree with those opinions.Anyway,every Clint Eastwood movie has got a special and sophisticated language if you can get the message and you can deeply comprehend.Finally,I recommend it to everybody and I like to increase its vote level.Because it deserves to be mentioned with the greatest movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood did a magnificent job on this motion picture. Not only does it contain great choreography, but a magnificent cast, and a magnificent director. This is number 3 on my all time favorites list, following Giant, and Gettysburg. Though this film may not be your taste, it captures your attention, and it makes the storyline believable. To some this may seem like trash, but to me this is a wonderfully made movie, which I recommend to anybody who wants to see a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How this film only rates a 6.9 with imdb users is beyond me. It's by-far the best thing Eastwood, Costner or Dern have EVER done. If you've never seen it, go rent it right now. It's one of the best films ever made and the little kid is outstanding. Costner always gets a lot of flack for his acting (some of it justified) but anyone who thinks he can't act has never seen this film.I've seen it 10 times at least but my eyes are still glued to the screen every time it comes on again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect World - lousy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even Clint Eastwood is not immune to the law of averages; he's bound to turn out a dud once in a while (e.g., "White Hunter, Black Heart") and this is a dud. Look up 'phony' in the dictionary, and you'll find this picture listed; everything about it rings false.A con (Costner) and his cellmate escape from prison. During the course of the escape they take a small boy hostage. Eastwood is the Texas Ranger who must track him down.Costner's con, you see, has suffered abuse as a child, so of course he turns out to be sort of an avenging angel against abusers, protecting the boy from his cellmate and generally acting as a shining defender of kids in general. (The reality, which is that victims of child abuse overwhelmingly go on to become abusers themselves, would not make for so warm and fuzzy a story). Predictably, the kid and the con go through a protracted bonding process wherein Costner turns out to be just a peachy-keen swell sort of guy, just right to fill in for the dad the boy doesn't have. The fact that he has kidnapped the kid, kills two people in the course of the movie, terrorizes a family that has shown him and the kid hospitality, subverted the mother's religion in the eyes of the child, and brought untold emotional suffering to the kid's mom (whom we see for no more than 5 minutes total) is not supposed to interfere with our sympathy for this crumb.Laura Dern's function here, in the part of a penology expert assigned to the case by the governor, is to supply the opportunity for the boringly predictable little P.C. sermonettes about gender oppression and female empowerment that movies must have nowadays (is there a federal mandate at work here?).Clint still has it in him to make a good thriller, e.g "In the Line of Fire", but he shows signs of being seduced by the siren song of trendy social issues and 'victimology'. This movie smacks more of Oprah Winfrey than of Harry Callahan. Forget it. Watch "Magnum Force" again instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robber-murderer Kevin Costner befriends a little boy that he has kidnapped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Perfect World" is not a perfect film, but it is a good to very good film. And what makes it above average is the scripted character and Kevin Costner's excellent portrayal of that character. With a look and a gleam in his eyes, he gives us a broad range of emotions in his bad guy-good guy robber-murderer. Director Eastwood also has used Costner's physical presence very well indeed in a number of scenes, both to get across his threats, his incipient and actual rage and violence, as well as his more positive feelings.The picture is an extended character study of a criminal, attained by showing the man's actions and interactions with other people. His back story is told through Laura Dern's character, but that's incidental. Mainly we acquaint ourselves with this man, Robert 'Butch' Haynes, through his words and deeds during his escape and after.The story of Haynes and his relationship with the boy Buzz (T.J. Lowther) is framed as a chase for him, the escaped criminal who has abducted a little boy as a hostage. However, the chase itself from the police side is both minimal and perfunctory, as are all of the police and government officials. They are mostly stereotypes and not well-scripted. An anachronistic feminist kind of conflict is ginned up between Dern's criminologist type and both Eastwood's Chief and the FBI assassin who is itching to be the sniper that kills Costner. This surrounding set of characters and their quite passive chase is at times treated as comic relief. Most of it adds very little to the film. If these had been treated more seriously and realistically and if the Costner-Lowther relationship had been treated a bit less sentimentally or unrealistically in places, this script could have been turned into a true classic. Apparently, this is easier said than done. But I do wonder whether a writer like Hancock who did such a great job with Haynes was influenced by Hollywood to give us the other much weaker characters or whether this was his idea.Eastwood's character, Chief Garnett is built up to some extent by making him the man who years ago saw to it that Haynes was sent to a juvenile facility, a tough one from which he emerged a criminal. There were no good options because the father of Haynes was an habitual criminal and his mother a whore. Speaking for all of us, Garnett realizes at the end how little he knows about anything.Haynes is very intelligent, but his movements are anything but smart. This is because he wants to get back at people around him, tweak them, rub their noses in the dirt of their smug world, the "perfect world". He wants to get back at them for his youth and for their part in making him the criminal that he is. He doesn't want a new life as much as he wants to use his bit of freedom to exercise the power of intimidation and taking. He knows it's wrong, but he cannot control his passions. And they can erupt when he sees children mistreated by parents.I have come to appreciate and like Kevin Costner's performances. He knows what he is about and how to fashion a portrayal that will outlast the times that date movies. I've only seen a handful of his films (Revenge (1990), The Bodyguard (1992), Silverado (1985), Wyatt Earp (1994), Open Range (2003), JFK (1991), No Way Out (1997), The Untouchables (1987)). It's enough to see the merit in his acting and his acting capacities. His physicality is a resource that good directors can tap. His subdued or cooler acting style, like that of Alan Ladd, can create a role that survives the passing fashions and times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Costner's better performances, all-around gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Perfect World", a seldom-mentioned entry in Clint Eastwood's credits is a riveting character study that sees Kevin Costner as an escaped con who takes an 8 year-old boy hostage during his getaway. Giving chase is Eastwood as a grizzled Texas Ranger, and the fetching Laura Dern as his bookworm tagalong. A bond is forged between captive and captor that gives the film its emotional center. Both con and child find something in each other, one a tragic father figure, the other a surrogate sidekick.It's a slow burn, with the only action scenes being a speedy getaway and few gunshots. But the relationship between the two feels authentic, the kid's cute, and Costner even tends towards the likable (even with the lurking undercurrent of menace in his hardened criminal). It's a buildup - one that's quietly suspenseful - to a climactic scene that brings everyone involved to a date with fate, itself. And it's a movie that sticks with you, long after the credits roll. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Costner at the height of his powers.Touching and heartfelt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a sucker for any decent road movie, i was always predestined to enjoy this one. The surprising thing is that it's taken all of nineteen years to get round to it. I've always found Kevin Costner to be a likable screen presence and it's here, at the height of his stardom, with top billing that he's on great form. Costner plays Robert 'Butch' Haynes, an escaped convict who due to a botched robbery ends up kidnapping 'Buzz' , a young boy (T.J Lowther) with whom he forms an unlikely mutual bond. Although there's an inherent darkness to proceedings, there's also much sweetness. They form the kind of father and son friendship that as the film unfolds, we realise Haynes never had making it easier to feel sympathetic toward him amid the crime spree. Later in the film, that same sympathy is tested as it's revealed how emotionally damaged Haynes is. To the boy, the whole thing is an exciting adventure as it's highlighted early on that his religious background has kept him somewhat excluded. Haynes on the other hand seems to treat the escapade as therapy for the upbringing he never had. He constantly gives the boy choices and at no point does it feel like a dangerous hostage situation. As with all the better Clint Eastwood directed films, it's stylistically unfussy with emphasis on building a strong relationship between audience and character. Eastwood himself is a great presence in the film, playing a law man trying to keep a steady head, and shares some excellent screen time with Laura Dern. The screenplay also deserves a nod as it serves up some fun interplay dialogue and observations. Some very minor flaws push the limits of credibility, one in particular involving Buzz behind the wheel of a car and some expert last minute breaking, but they give way to what is a heartfelt and touching experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Violence is something I've tried to move away from." - EastwoodMost of Clint Eastwood's early films were reactionary fantasies. Later in his career he actively set out to repudiate the messages of these films. And so from the late 1980s onwards he'd specialise in flicks which meditate upon violence, critique machismo, flawed father figures and supposedly put forth "anti violence" messages, though in most cases ("Unforgiven", "Gran Torino" etc) what these films do and pretend to do are completely at odds. Still, Eastwood's films during the second half of his career sometimes went interesting places, the best examples of which are probably "White Hunter, Black Heart" and "A Perfect World".Set in 1963, the year President JFK was assassinated, "A Perfect World" stars Kevin Costner as an escaped convict who kidnaps a seven year old boy, uses the kid as a hostage, and flees cross-country in a stolen car. Costner is pursued by a team of Texas Rangers, led by Eastwood. While the film sports all the totems of the road/pursuit/Texan/cat-and-mouse movie ? lots of evocative shots of rural Texas, trigger happy law enforcement officers, car chases, an episodic plot etc ? Eastwood's film functions more as a meditation on the genre; think "Sugarland Express" or "Thelma and Louise" as written by a bleeding heart criminal psychologist. And so rather than a cat-and-mouse game, the film's law enforcement officials are mostly inept, are given no generic action set pieces and spend the film lethargically pontificating and/or dwelling on their target's psychology, history and motivations. Fairly radical, the film then explicitly blames Eastwood's character for causing Costner's descent into criminality. It is rare for a film to reject essentialism, but "World" does this, portraying Costner as a victim of social exclusion and social/structural forces, all of which were exasperated when a hard-lined cop (Eastwood, literally playing an elderly, introspective Dirty Harry) unnecessarily sentenced Coaster to prison as a kid, a place where he was "reformed" into a super-criminal. The message: Dirty Harry causes crime, the social/state creates the personal, and authoritarian, right-wing justice has long term negative effects, even if they occasionally have short term gains.The film's title - "A Perfect World" - however, injects an air of ambiguity. Wild West justice has horrible ripples, the film says, but we're positioned to side with Costner when he murders a paedophile. Elsewhere Eastwood challenges us with a daring, unconventional, prolonged last act sequence in which the once lovable Costner abuses a family (a black family no less; a middle finger to liberals). The film also features an interesting, if woefully underused character played by Laura Dern. She's a criminal psychologist, the effeminate, touchy-feely foil to the ageing Eastwood, a woman who challenges Dirty Harry's conceptions of law and crime prevention.The film features a woefully overextend final act, too much false moments and forced pathos, is 30 minutes too long and contains a predictable/sappy ending in which Costner is gunned down, but nevertheless remains one of Eastwood's best. T. J. Lowther, who plays the kid Costner kidnaps, is also given a good "coming of age" arc. His performance is powerfully raw at times.It's "World's" plot, though, which makes it stand out. At its core it pits "Right realism", which focuses on control, containment and punishment, against the soft rehabilitation of "Left realism". Each side of the spectrum criticises the other, one painted as too hard-nosed and futile, the other too impractical, sympathetic and obsessed with causes. In the 1980s, academics ("Crime and Human Nature" by Wilson and Herrnstein) began to put forth more nuanced explanations of crime, considering biological, social and genetic factors, whilst in the 90s some studies (Murray's "Bell Curve") began to revert to Darwinist connotations, by attributing crime to low impulse control, low intelligence, "poor socialisation", genes and "excessive extroversion". Political scientist Charles Murray would go so far as to blame the "generous revolution" of the welfare state for crime. In the 80s, Right realists began to turn to theorists like Ron Clarke, who asserted that Rational Choice Theory "proves" that individuals have free will and the power of reason and should therefore be punished harshly. Left realists counter this and take a more existential position, turning to neuroscience to question the very nature of free will, autonomy and consciousness. In the 21st century, studies began officially debunking links between IQ and crime whilst right realists were accused of focusing on petty street crime whilst ignoring larger, corporate/state crimes, which are demonstrably more costly/harmful. The Right's zero tolerance policy began to once again be accused of leading to discrimination and racism, and several studies were published which debunked the long-standing notion that "tough" policies reversed rising crime rates during the 1970s-90s.Existing outside the left/right divide you then have anarchists who typically romanticise working class criminals. Left realists argue working class criminals mostly victimise other working class people; not the rich. The right thinks they're both insane. Marxist scientists ignore all groups from an aloof perch. For them, all crime is a matter of economics. Today numerous studies (Lea and Young etc) corroborate the seemingly obvious; aside from crimes of passion, crime is overwhelmingly due to deprivation and (economic) marginalisation. Some counter this: poverty was high in the 1930's but crime low (and increases with rises in living standards). Enter relativity. Professor W.G. Runcimans starts using the concept of relative deprivation to explain the paradox. For him, an ideology of individualism, self interest at the expense of others and individual rights cause crime and social disintegration (undermining values of mutual support and selflessness). Right realists accuse this of sounding like nutty commie perversions. And on and on the dance goes. Eastwood is rare in that he has existed on both extremes of the pendulum.8/10 ? See Kloves' "Flesh and Bone". Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfectly good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is an outstanding Director. He directs A Perfect World masterly and we really feel en emotional involvement with the characters and the story.T.J. Lowther is fantastic as the boy kidnapped by Butch (Kevin Costner), and it is great to see an unlikely friendship develop between the two despite their huge difference in background and age. Costner becomes almost like a father figure for Buzz, and the ending is slightly overdrawn and predictable, but is nonetheless deeply saddening.Costner gives a great performance as the escaped convict, and despite his homicidal tendencies, we actually feel empathy towards him at some points of the film and feel that he is actually a casualty of bad circumstances rather than a blood thirsty killer.Eastwood himself plays a reliable part as Chief Red Garnett, but he is very much in the background and he plays a bit-part character as he tries to track down Costner.I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood both as a Director and actor. If you want to watch a film that really engages you in watching character development and does not focus on action, then this is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sentimental film about things seemingly not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are numerous directions Clint Eastwood and screenwriter John Lee Hancock could've taken in his film, A Perfect World, and the one he sucks up and follows is a brave, endearing roller-coaster of emotion, sentiment, and commentary all providing slick and clean moments robbed of mawkish sequences. This is the seventeenth directing effort by Eastwood himself, cementing the fact that the question of whether or not he is a better actor or director can never be answered. There are far too many examples to back up both.A Perfect World begins by showing us a deeply depraved, saddening family of devout Jehovah's Witnesses. Phillip Perry (T.J. Lowther) is a young boy, victim to not having birthdays, holidays, or events that pack in true joy for a child because of his mother's preposterous rules. His two sisters are too the victims. When a robbery is committed in the house, Kevin Costner's "Butch" Haynes takes the kid as a hostage, and Butch's loudmouth partner just waves a gun around and causes mayhem.When he is finally abandoned long after the robbery, Butch and Phillip discover they have a lot more in common with each other than they could've imagined. Butch's dad was never around, and his mother was a prostitute, accompanied by men they couldn't care less about him. Phillip's dad is a simple deadbeat, never there and never going to be. The film shows how destructive and possibly dehumanizing it can be without a prominent male influence in your life. I'm blessed to have two caring parents and that has helped me in more ways than I can imagine.It's big shame that many grow up today fatherless. An argument could be made about what is tougher; growing up with no mother, or no father. Without a father, you don't get the "time to be a man" talk, you never feel you can ask personal body questions to anyone, and this leads to the lack of parental supervision, causing kids to perhaps meander the streets aimlessly. Without a mother, you've lost the softness every person must occupy. You lack the necessity of, maybe, truly being safe and cared for. Sure a man could do so, but answer me this; when children cry, do they want mommy or daddy? I've trailed off course. A subplot of A Perfect World involves Eastwood's Texas Ranger Red Garnett and his crew on hot pursuit, destined to find Butch and Phillip. The subplot sounded so obligatory on paper, but writer Hancock is intelligent about keeping it a minimal occurrence. Not to mention, it isn't as intrusive or as dopey as it seems. It's actually taken with a lot of seriousness and heart.Performance-wise, the film is around the clock superb. Much acclaim is due to Costner's character, who is serenely nuanced enough to make a true, memorable character. He has an outer-layer of cruelty but an inner layer of gooey anti-cynicism which comes forth very quickly. T.J. Lowther is spunky and charismatic as little Phillip, and Eastwood, do I even need to say it? Is incredible.A Perfect World may extend a bit over the recommended time limit, but few, few spots are dry, the script is always attentive, and the casting and directing style of Eastwood is fitting and balanced. This is probably Costner's most dedicated and engaging performances, yet due to the moderate box office receipts and the minimal impact, it has likely made him reconsider serious roles. Same thing could possibly go for Robert De Niro. It's undoubtedly easier to immerse yourself into a character that is thin, vacuous, and dull than one that is developed, deep, and potential-ridden. Eastwood has made a sentimental gem of a picture, with topics that hit seemingly hit every note but.Starring: Kevin Costner, T.J. Lowther, and Clint Eastwood.

		<shortDescription>Perfect Eastwood and Costner Collaboration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Perfect World is a film directed by Clint Eastwood that stars Kevin Costner as Butch Haynes,an escaped convict who befriends a young boy,and ends up embarking on a road trip with the child. Clint Eastwood co-stars as Red Garnett,a Texas Ranger in pursuit of the convict together with Laura Dern and T.J. Lowther.A Perfect World is a character study, appearing in the guise of a cops- and-robbers action picture. The movie takes place during the fall of 1963. Eight-year old Phillip Perry, the son of a devout Jehovah's Witness mother, is staying home while all the other children are out trick-or-treating. But then prison escapee Butch Haynes appears in his kitchen. Needing a hostage to aid him in his escape from jail,he grabs Phillip. Phillip curiously looks up to Butch and willingly accompanies him. Butch gets rid of his fellow escapee after he tries to molest the child, and Butch and Phillip take to the Texas highway, on the run from the cops. The cop in pursuit in this instance is Police Chief Red Garnett,riding in his sleek Populux Airglide trailer that happens to be his mobile command headquarters. On the road with Garnett is Sally Gerber, a pushy feminist criminologist, along with a creepy federal agent who is an expert sharpshooter. Butch is not particularly anxious to make it to the Texas borderline, and neither is Garnett in any particular hurry to catch Butch. As Butch and Phillip form a father-son attachment, the paths of Butch and Garnett gradually come together, in time for a final dramatic and emotional confrontation.The conclusion of the film is very dramatic that it brought tears into my eyes.It only reminds every viewer that there is goodness in every human being. Aside from the ending,the story itself was full of accurate depiction of what hostages go through and the emotional depth that are given to each characters of the story.The story was also absorbing and fascinating that never felt contrived and artificial whatsoever. It was definitely one of the best performances of Costner and one of the best films directed by Eastwood.A perfect collaboration indeed.In summary,A Perfect World deserves a perfect 10/10 rating!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very few directors have the talent Clint Eastwood has for making intense movies with greater depth. In this movie, Clint is no exception and he stars multiple characters in this movie, while repeatedly crossing the lines between good and bad.In various parts of the movie, Butch (Kevin Costner) is depicted as the adoptive father and role model of the kid he has kidnapped, and they bond like a family, and he becomes like the father the kid never had and allows the kid to do all the stuff his controlling mother would not let him do. The butch character sells the movie and having Clint Eastwood on the manhunt gives us a great feature.On the other hand, we are led into the facts that some of the police and feds who are pursuing this man are in fact closer to thugs than the person they are pursuing. Clint Eastwood makes no distinctions of good and evil and continuously develops the characters throughout the movie in order to give a more emotionally invoking movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many movies that are based on the same theme and some of them are even difficult to remember. But the credit for this nice movie must go to Clint Eastwood in the manner he has handled the familiar theme. Costner once again plays an unforgettable character and the performance by the small boy is also very good. The relationship between Costner and Phillip proves that even a convict can raise a child correctly if he knows how to handle a child properly. Costner treats the child with love and respect and this is something most of the parents can learn from this movie. Eastwood also avoids too much focus on his own character and this is also one of the strong points of this movie. He deserves a lot more credit than he gets and this film once again proves that even a routine story can be made into a very nice movie if it is in the hands of an able director like Clint Eastwood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Perfect World is directed by Clint Eastwood and written by John Lee Hancock. It stars Eastwood, Kevin Costner, Laura Dern, T.J. Lowther and Bradley Whitford. Music is by Lennie Niehaus and cinematography by Jack N. Green.Texas 1963 and having broken out of Huntsville Penitentiary, murderer Butch Haynes (Costner) heads for Alaska taking Phillip (Lowther) a young Jehovah's Witness hostage along the way. Pursued by Texas Ranger Red Garnett (Eastwood), the two begin to bond and learn about each other's experiences and hang-ups.Eastwood had just made the awards darling that was Unforgiven and Costner was off the back of The Bodyguard, the second highest grossing (worldwide) film of 1992. Their next venture would be A Perfect World, a small movie in terms of finance gains and trumpet blowing fanfares. Yet it's one of the most impressive films on either of their respective rsums. For Eastwood it gave him the chance to take a relatively small acting role whilst directing with a smooth assurance often lacking in today's day and age. For Costner it gave him a role to really bring out the actor that he was rarely asked to be, and he delivers in spades with a quite spellbindingly layered performance, for us the chance to watch a character and not Costner the star.On the surface it seemed like it was a standard crims on the run picture, topped up with a Stockholm Syndrome relationship between man and boy. Yet there is nothing normal about the story put forward here, nothing seedy or threateningly child murder like, but based around father and son relationships, the presence "of" in one case, the absence "of" in the other. Once Butch and Phillip (Lowther also terrific under Eastwood and Costner's promptings) are brought together by circumstance, their lives will never be the same, the can opens and out come emotional scars, repressions and childhoods tarnished and being wasted.It's an undeniably moving picture, but Eastwood is aware and subtle enough to never let the picture become mawkish. The pacing is deliberately slow and calm, the long periods of Butch and Phillip holding centre stage are only briefly interrupted by the scenes of Eastwood's Garnett and his police companions (Dern's Sally Gerber the criminologist, Whitford's FBI marksman Bobby Lee) in pursuit and travelling in an airstream trailer. These are necessary breaks that never outstay their welcome, and they add a richness to the Butch characterisation as Garnett, under Gerber's guidance, comes to understand much more about the man he pursues. There's also a little humour in that trailer, giving good characterisations away from the sombre tone waiting around the next corner.There is very little action so the shoot-out loving crowd are advised this isn't the film for them, but the pic never lacks for tension, with the key scene at a black family farm as taut as it gets and acted with supreme skill by all involved. This is a throwback type of film, where narrative strength is first and foremost, something that allows actors to work with characters that have depth, to be part of a relationship that is complex and absorbing to the viewer. It's still the most under rated work of Eastwood the director and Costner the actor, one of the best films of 93, in fact, one of the best films of the decade. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offbeat character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case you momentarily forget the title of this film, about a third of the way in, one of the law enforcement officials says it out loud. This Eastwood-directed 1960s-set crime flick has Costner as a convict on the run, with Eastwood a Texas Ranger on his trail. Costner's luckless character aims to get to Alaska. Along the way,he takes a little boy hostage, and the two bond on their short-lived journey. Costner in effect becomes the boy's dad. Eastwood's Ranger character takes a back seat to Costner's laconic convict. This is a character study, and Costner is terrific, although at times he is a bit hard to swallow as a gun-toting bad guy. The kid is solid, mostly mute but with wonderful facial expressions. The fumbling cops pursuing the pair are like the old Keystone Kops, or as one reviewer put it, like the doofus cops from THE DUKES OF HAZZARD. Music is used sparingly, mostly in the form of popular tunes from the era. Very watchable over and over again, so that you can pick up on all the nuances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised when this was released in 1993 that it was not a box office hit.It was the beginning of Costner's box office slide after several years of mostly hit films.I think it is a very good film.Clint, not anything new he was doing here, but he did his usual good job with the role.Costner, not the best actor in the world, but he did a good job with his role. And, it was not a normal role for him.Dern, 1993 being her only hit movie year after the great "Jurassic Park", although her role was small, she did the best of it &amp; at least it was written where a woman could be smart &amp; tough in a law enforcement type position.I liked the relationship that developed between Butch and Phillip. Which was the point of the film.Costner &amp; the little boy worked well together.It was nice to see the little boy have some sort of life &amp; do SOMETHING because at home, well, he had none. Parents broken up with a mother not allowing him to do anything fun because of a religious belief.Good directing job by Clint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thesis: "A Perfect World"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has really nothing to do with religion. It's just testing the thesis that this is "a perfect world". The contents of the movie itself is the antithesis. This is no perfect world, many people can't afford visiting amusement parks or live a good life. "Ordinary" children with money are allowed to do various activities while Philip who is poor isn't. He can't do things children are supposed to do. That's the reason for the list. This has nothing to do with Jehovas Witnesses, as some people think.In a perfect world smart guys like Butch get a chance to do something out of their lives. They don't have to turn into criminals. The society in this "perfect world" never gives poor smart people a chance. In a perfect world everyone get what they need to live a good life, and don't have to steal.The movie is about our modern society and how sick it is. Not about religion! Clint Eastwood doesn't only want to entertain with his movies. There's a certain depth in them, he wants to tell us something about how and why people live their lives like they do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood and Costner's great collaboration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Costner wins Best Director and Picture and is nominated Best Actor for "Dance With Wolves" in 1990. Eastwood wins Best Director and Picture and is nominated Best Actor for "Unforgiven" in 1992. Then right thereafter, the 2 actor/directors collaborate on Eastwood's film A PERFECT WORLD (1993). This time, Eastwood directs (and costars) and Costner stars. This film, "A Perfect World", is better than either of those 2 highly lauded, awarded films. It is more even-toned, has a much better pacing and exciting feel, has more memorable supporting characters, and contains what very well may be the best performance of Kevin Costner's career. I know he has gotten a mixed bag of reviews over the years in terms of his acting, but I always thought Costner could act. A lot of actors have not risen to the occasion when cast in the wrong roles, but Costner always seemed to choose the right roles (at least from the late 80s to the early 90s) and this film is the culmination of all those great choices.A PERFECT WORLD is set in 1963 Texas (right before Kennedy is to visit Dallas) and centers around escaped convict Butch Haynes (played by Costner), who breaks out of prison with another prisoner. They come upon the house of a woman with 3 children (2 twin girls and a young boy) who are practicing Jehovah's witnesses. They kidnap the boy Phillip (played by T.J. Lowther in an impressive performance) and use him as a hostage to try to make their way out of the state down into Mexico. Soon after, Costner rids himself of the other prisoner (Keith Szarabajka in a brief, but memorable role) because he tried to hurt the boy. Butch was abused as a child by his father, so he hates child abuse in any form or fashion. So Butch and Phillip go it alone.In hot pursuit of Butch and the boy are a group of Texas Rangers, led by Red Garnett (stolidly played by director Clint Eastwood). Garnett recalls arresting Butch when he was a teenager, which resulted in Butch being sent to reform school and Butch never stayed out of the life of crime since, so Red feels partially responsible for the current situation. Along for the ride with the Rangers is a psychologist Sally Gerber (played with earnest empathy by Laura Dern) who can help by offering input into Butch's psyche and predict his next move and whether or not he is going to hurt the boy.The relationship between Butch and Phillip is a beautiful one to watch, as Butch acts as a surrogate father to Phillip on the 'trip'. Butch teaches Phillip how to drive, some basic lessons and values, and how to fend for himself. And none of these scenes are cute or schmaltzy. They are tender, touching, and heartfelt. The viewer actually gains a respect and admiration for this paternal side of Butch. And Phillip has to be the least annoying child in any film in the last 15 or so years since this film came out. He doesn't say much and when he does, it doesn't make you want to wince in pain or cry out in terror because of how bad of an actor or how too cute he is. The young actor T.J. Lowther deserves much credit and Costner too for helping him with his performance.This has to be one of the best 'road' movies ever made, as Butch and Phillip get into all kinds of trouble and meet various people on their journey (1) a man whose car Butch steals, (2) a couple of female convenience store employees one of whom Butch flirts with and the other who thinks Phillip is adorable, (3) a diner waitress who Butch lusts after because it's been such a long time since he's been with a woman, (4) a couple with 2 children from whom Butch 'borrows' their car, and (5) at the climax an elderly black couple with a grandson that they are raising; the grandfather hits the child which leads to the climactic series of events which follow. This eclectic collection of characters are much more memorable than any of the supporting players in "Dances with Wolves" and "Unforgiven", and they all leave a lasting impression.Of course at the end there has to be the showdown between Butch and the Rangers. And it is a very sad ending as Phillip has developed a strong bond for and love of Butch because even though he knew that Butch was a criminal and bad man, he filled a void that had existed in his life that the boy strongly needed.Costner is utterly memorable here (should have been nominated Best Actor) and Eastwood has directed a fine film (should have been nominated Best Director and Picture), among his best, maybe better than anything he's done the last 20 years (and that includes the films that he's recently won Oscars for). A PERFECT WORLD is more than worth the watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exploration of violence and redeeming souls, artfully directed and acted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This exploration of the causes of human violence are dealt with in this film. From the sad and the conflictual damaging childhood of Butch Haynes to the needless arrogance and violence- for-violence sake of Brad Whitford's character, violence is sad from all directions. The movie is directed wonderfully, acted skillfully and scenes intended to be suspenseful or comic are just right. A heartfelt performance by Costner and great directing by Clintwood, along with a terrific script have crafted a very fine movie. T.J. Lowther delivers a terrific performance, with just the right touches of believability in an otherwise hard-to-believe situation. Seeing Bradley Whitford, as truly a bad guy, wearing a white hat, proves my hunch, that he is a fine actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Costner and Clint produce a sleeper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Costner's best work. A small movie beautifully directed by Clint Eastwood (a sign of things to come), "Perfect World" uses Costner's, easygoing charm to build a touching relationship with a child hostage. Unlike so many things Costner has done this movie was emotionally understated and was not afraid to move slowly to allow character development. T.J. Lowther as the young hostage does a wonderfully subtle job displaying a wide range of emotions. His excellent chemistry with Costner stole the movie. The scenes with the two "outlaws" were poignant, moving and surprisingly believable given the circumstances. Costner's "Butch Haynes" is far from two dimensional when his dark side is revealed near the end of the movie. This is clearly a disturbed man who for a brief time finds much needed reciprocal love before his inevitable self-destruction. No matter what happens both characters are better off having found one another, however briefly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kevin Costner's Greatest Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in order, I come to 1993's A Perfect World. Plot In A Paragraph: Butch Haynes (KC) escapes from prison and kidnaps a young boy (T.J. Lowther) In hot pursuit is a Texas Ranger, Red Garrett (Clint Eastwood)A Perfect World is not a great movie, it's an underrated masterpiece that has somehow slipped through the cracks, despite great reviews (I remember one saying "You'll be Unforgiven For Missing A Perfect World) it was overlooked on its initial release, and has been largely forgotten since. On paper, the film should have produced an instant box office hit. KC was Hollywoods golden boy, producing hit after hit (Dances With Wolves, Prince Of Thieves, JFK and The Bodyguard) whilst Eastwood had just won a pair of Oscars for Unforgiven, and had a hit with In The Line Of Fire, yet for some reason audiences stayed away. The trailers didn't really help, as they were uninspiring to say the least, and didn't convey the tone of the movie at all.I urge everybody to revisit it. Not only because A Perfect World features the best performance of KC's career, it may also the best movie Clint Eastwood has directed, yes I am including my own personal favourite, The Outlaw Josie Wales and Oscar winning Unforgiven in that statement. The movie has a prison break, a kidnapping and murders but it's not really about any of their things, it's so much deeper than that. The heart of the movie is the relationship between Butch and Phillip. Butch isn't a nice guy, we see plenty of examples of this, but he is kind to the boy, and Phillip isn't a cute movie kid, and with his natural performance and expressive face, he does not come off as a child actor either (which is the highest compliment I can give) This isn't just KC's best performance, it's probably my personal favourite KC performance too. It's amazing and combines everything that he is so good at. Butch is charming and sincere but also short tempered, (especially if he sees children being mistreated) unpredictable and very dangerous. Most of KC's scenes are with Lowther and the two have such great chemistry together that you really do feel the bond developing between them.Clint takes an unexpected back seat in this one, and that's fine. Also fine is Laura Dern (who I've always being strangely attracted to) playing a criminologist who isn't just along for the ride.While the movie could have easily been a bog standard chase movie, but it's patient pacing and its themes (father and son bonds) elevate it to greatness. Much like Unforgiven the movie is a warning about violence. Especially violence towards children. As a crime drama, it is effective and tense, but as a story of fathers and sons, it becomes something more poignant. It's a a deeply satisfying slow-burner that only improves with age. Worthy of note is the score by Lennie Niehaus (who Eastwood used often) and a track called Big Frans Baby, the location work and Eastwood's use of colours. Criminally over looked at the time of its release. A Perfect World ended the year 54th highest grossing movie of 1993, with a domestic gross of $31 million, to put that into context, Cop And A Half grossed more!! America should hang it's head in shame. Everyone who has seen it, should revisit this gem. If you haven't seen it, I strongly recommend you do so. 10/10 for this reviewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Perfect World is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.I was really expecting this to be a very thrilling crime movie,but it was very much a drama that follows an escaped convict who kidnaps a child that soon makes him change his way.Kevin Costner does an outstanding job portraying this criminal,and the relationship between him and the young child is so sweet and sentimental that it is very hard to believe they are just acting,Clint Eastwood's directing in this is absolutely brilliant.The movie is still very much a thriller as well though,there are some very intense scenes and the characters dialogue is very dramatic and well delivered.Surprisingly sweet and a very easy story to get sucked in to,A Perfect World is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or crime film. An escaped prisoner becomes attached to the boy he kidnaps while on the run from Texas Rangers.Best Performance: Kevin Costner Worst Performance: Ray McKinnon</fullReview>

But unfortunately here we can see how people judge you , they treats you by appearance and not treat you after your true essence.. I mean some people don't understand that someone can change. Kevin Costner plays very good his character , he show durity but in the same time he shows sensibility too . So ,I just love and appreciate this movie , because is simple , has a good storyline full of emotion and drama and show us how can people be , even if at first glance seem bad .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's perspective on the human condition is remarkable. In this film he takes the best of each cadre of the cast and seems to make the entire thing about everyone's agenda. Keith Szarabajka is the perfect sociopath, and you can tell he is not long for the film. Kevin Costner is not a career criminal, just a wild youth who got sent up on the recommendation of Garnett years ago, a recommendation he is now regretting. Eastwood and Dern are the realists on the Law Enforcement side, trying to cope with a situation while dealing with the politics of the situation. Bradley Whitford should really be in the prison uniform, but instead plays the FBI sniper who is intent on proving to everyone his testosterone levels are up to the task. Throughout the film, the relationship between Costner and Lowther is the principle theme, and you can tell Costner's character is basically a decent person, although there are some things in his understand of life that need a little adjustment. The end of the film is as powerful as the beginning, and this early Eastwood epic ranks up there with Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby as a powerful film with a subtle, but provocative message. Rated R for violence, language, and sexual content. If you are an Eastwood fan, you are going to want this one for your collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kostner at his best, a nice odd buddy movie, and some pretty routine Eastwood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Perfect World (1993)The best of this movie is the bulk of it--an improbable friendship between a man (a small time convict on the run) and a boy (his hostage). Kevin Kostner and 7-year old T. J. Lowther make a very comfortable pair, and you really come to like them and want even Kostner's character to come out okay.But you have to put up with a poorly made first ten minutes (an unlikely escape, and a poorly choreographed breaking into a house). You also have to like Clint Eastwoods dry, simple sense of humor, and his cool indifference even when he sometimes needs to pay attention. Of course, this style is Eastwood's stock in trade, and many would have it no other way. I think most people find the Kostner parts of the movie far more complex and interesting, as I did, too. There are a host of other actors of some note, too, especially Laura Dern, who is meant to be a new kind of woman cop, but she actually gets pretty well stepped on and belittled by both Eastwoods (the actor and the director).So this ends up being a feel good movie of a not-so-rotten convict on the run and a sweet as heck boy who befriends him. The cops in pursuit are comical (on purpose) and the movie really is an entertainment above all, genuinely warm and funny in alternating sections. It's not a great movie, but it doesn't pretend to be, so take it as a good time, ignore the opening ten minutes, and all will be well. More or less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Liesurely study of crime and character.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An escaped prison inmate (Kevin Costner) kidnaps a young boy (T. J. Lowther), steals numerous cars, encounters people of various dispositions, and aims towards Alaska with his kidnapee. Meanwhile he is pursued across the panhandle, sometimes comically, by a Texas Ranger (Clint Eastwood) and a handful of advisers including Laura Dern. The basic story, aside from the inexorability of the law's closing in, has to do with the relationship between the boy, who comes from a rather restrictive household of Jehovah's Witnesses, and the casually cold-blooded Costner, who begins to take on the role of big brother. It ends tragically.The performances are adequate, partly because of professional competence, party because the actors themselves are innately appealing. Clint is only himself, as performer and as director. The pace is slow but the movie doesn't meander. It's an unusual role for Costner. I mean, he's an innocent, fun-loving, idealistic kind of surfer guy, right? And here he is packing a pistola and abusing people without a sign of chagrin. The little kid, about eight or so, isn't as obnoxious as he might have been, not even when he takes advantage of the opportunity to shoplift and don a Halloween costume of Casper the Friendly Ghost. (His family doesn't hold with Halloween.) Perhaps luckily for us, he isn't given that much to say, although, to be sure, sometimes these little buggers can be uncannily effective actors. It's nice that Laura Dern is in it, though her role is pretty much dispensable. Her features are curiously arranged but she's attractive with her long, unruly blond hair and her dark eyebrows, and she's fulsomely sensual too, for a leptosome. The actor who is perfect in image and performance is Wayne Dehart as a good-natured, generous black farmer whose family is tied up and who is almost murdered by Costner after taking him and the boy in for the night and feeding them. (There were people who would do that in the period of this film, the early 1960s.) This scene makes it entirely clear that Costner has some buried basura that can turn him into a remorseless killer as easily as popping a zit. The director and the writer (John Lee Hancock) kind of blow it in the last scene. Costner has been gut shot by the boy trying to prevent a slaughter, and now they are crumpled together under a "dogleg tree" in the middle of a grassy field, surrounded by police and FBI, who have Costner in their sights and are itching for a chance to take him out. It's an important scene but its impact is vitiated by the length at which it's drawn out. And when Costner sends the boy away and the boy turns around and rushes back into Costner's arms, the scene collapses completely. After all, the kid is so young that he has virtually no awareness of the importance of what's happening. He's just a kid. Here he is, chatting with Costner, who is bleeding like the Fountain of Trevi, and paying no attention to the possibly mortal wound he himself was responsible for. He ignores the ring of armed cops. When a police helicopter lands nearby, the kid brightens and exclaims, "Do you think they'll give me a ride in it?" This kind of kid shouldn't be sobbing on the dying Costner's shoulder. He should be running towards the police, waving his arms, shouting "Boo!", and trying to scare them in his spook costume. And the director and writer shouldn't be pandering to the sentimentalists in us.The movie in some ways resembles Terrence Malick's "Badlands" without being nearly as original. Costner giving the kid advice, for instance, telling him that his penis isn't "puny," that it's just right for somebody his age, reminds me of the scene in "Badlands" in which Martin Sheen is earnestly recording some banalities on tape -- "Always follow the rules of the majority but never forget about the minority view." Polonius on mushrooms. But it's those inconsequential moments that give this film the considerable thrust that it has. It's nothing for any of the participants to be ashamed of.</fullReview>

I agree with the previous reviewer that Kevin Costner gives one of the best performances of his career in this movie. You find yourself thinking that even though his character Butch does bad things, he is not really a bad person, but you can't really be sure, because he is pretty complex. I think the little boy saves him from being a bad person, or at least shows that he is definitely not all bad. In the end, it is like Laura Dern says - "In a perfect world, this wouldn't happen." I find myself watching this movie whenever I come across it, and would definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie many times... and still like to see many times. After reading all the comments so far I found that there are some other aspects of this movie (like 'jehova's witness) that I missed to notice (becos I do not know about Jehovas). But they have been expressed becos they are issues between the lines. I admire C.Eastwood for how he felt the movie and all the artistes for how they acted it. Music is excellent. A slow movie(this is not supposed to be a flaw). Though films just 'portray' a character it is important to realize how that character becomes 'lively'. Though you are a killer by now still you have your warm heart somewhere inside that was adulterated long back by evils of this otherwise perfect world. Violence is not just guns and knives..Its the inhumane nature that is growing inside us to treat the other fellow human being badly..that is what Butche's cell mate did..that is how that black grandpa treated his grandson.. Why Butch disturbs you of being Butch? Because of the conflicting character traits he shows. How come a criminal who kills brutally could be so tender enough to feel how a kid would feel?. For me this movie is one of my favourites. Happy Christmas.</fullReview>

Its amazing to see Costner act in this great work compared to other pieces of crap like the Postman and his non_English accent in Robin Hood. I see why one might dislike this movie. That is if you are Jehovah's witness. The story is definitely well crafted. Of course the ending can be seen as cliche, but what other endings could their be without showing the change in Costner's characters persona? There are very limited possibilities. I agree I found this movie much better than Unforgiven, but unfortunately it had to come out the same year that Hollywood handed their biggest money maker(Spielberg)the Oscar. If you are a diehard fan of the old Eastwood movies, you might find this a little harder to digest because there is a lot more thinking involved. This film is one of the most underrated movies of the past thirty years. If it were up for the 2001 Oscar, in a perfect world it would have beaten out Spartacus..... Er I mean Gladiator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's A Perfect World is a competent, engrossing, and very well-acted film. However by the time it's over, you may come to the conclusion that it doesn't have as much to say as it thinks it does. The film has a number of strengths, but it just doesn't gel together as completely as most viewers would hope.The story deals with two escaped criminals who kidnap a young boy and lead the police on a manhunt across Texas for them. The two escapees are hardly alike in their mannerisms and disposition, and soon it is just the intelligent one (Costner) and his young hostage who seems increasingly happy to be along for the ride. Clint Eastwood plays the head of the Texas Rangers (not the baseball team!) who leads a small group in not-so-hot pursuit of Costner and the boy. Laura Dern is along for the ride as a criminologist who keeps wanting to humanize Costner's character. There is also a smarmy FBI agent in the mix that is basically the embodiment of what Hollywood thinks of the US government. If ever there was a paper scarecrow of a character, than this guy is it. As the manhunt progresses, it becomes clear that Eastwood has a past with the Costner character, and would just rather he crossed the state line and became someone else's problem.Costner and the boy, on the other hand, seem to be having a blast getting into one hairy situation after another with various small town types they come in contact with. Honestly, Costner has never been better than with this Butch Haynes character. His chemistry with the boy is exceptional to say the least. The boy has been raised as a Jehova's Witness, which is basically the Taliban wing of Christianity. He has also been without a father, and Costner finally gives him the opportunity to have some fun and bond with an adult male. Things turn very ugly in a surprisingly violent climax at a sharecropper's home. The events which transpire in that house are something you will not see coming.There are some glaring problems with this film, though. Movies and other forms of entertainment have romanticized criminals to no end over the years as far back as the tales of Robin Hood. Costner's Butch Haynes character is just too intelligent and affable to be the kind of criminal he is reputed to be. A person with his charisma would just simply not be rotting away in a prison despite what was done to him at an early age by the authorities and his parents. The film has some glaring lapses in action, and a conclusion that takes WAY too long to work itself out. Eastwood does score points by doing a marvelous job of recreating rural Texas in 1963. It really does feel like you're riding along in the car with Costner and the boy.There are certainly enough good things about the film to recommend it though. 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Clint Eastwood directing, this is quite an interesting kidnap film with a pretty unusual villain. After escaping from a Huntsville prison, convict Butch Haynes (a really good Kevin Costner) and his partner Terry Pugh kidnap a young boy, Philip 'Buzz' Perry (T.J. Lowther), and flee across Texas. They get rid of Terry, and Butch and Philip discover common bonds and suffer the abuses of the outside "Perfect World." In pursuit are Texas Ranger "Red" Garnett (Clint Eastwood) and criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern). Costner is really good at being nice to the kid, when we the audience know that he has done a lot of wrong, and to be honest I hardly noticed or payed attention to Eastwood. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Eastwood's best works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film. It is such a human story. I can't think of any other film where all these characters are so real to the human eye. That's where Eastwood tricks you into believing all the characteristics of his characters in films like this and Mystic River. I read on IMDB that it was Costner who convinced Eastwood to take the role of the Marshall in this film which made me watch this dark masterpiece. Kevin Costner is an outlaw on the run from the police after escaping from prison with a fellow inmate who is as menacing as the next criminal and on the way they get involved with a family and it all goes wrong and they take the young boy of the family Phillip hostage. That is where the story begins and from there it is a cat and mouse story with a relaxed feeling to it. Eastwood does an excellent job letting the audience delve into the characters minds of their pass and present. What makes me love this film is how Eastwood turns Butch played by Costner into this lovable character who has a kind heart but he doesn't let you forget who is really is and that's a criminal. The scene where Butch and Phillip take refuge into the black man's house and Butch notices the black man beating his son and decides enough is enough and inflicts some of his own psychology pain is just a great moment in the film where the true colours of who Butch really unfolds. It isn't all serious either as Eastwood's character is very funny from time to time even right at the end he is still being clumsy when trying to talk to Butch through megaphone and is getting back sound. Overall A Perfect World isn't Eastwood's best film, that goes to Mystic River but this is still a very powerful and challenging film to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Eastwood/Costner vehicle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A PERFECT WORLD (1993) **** Clint Eastwood, Kevin Costner, Laura Dern, T.J. Lowther. Easily one of Eastwood's best directorial films. Absorbing character driven story of an escaped con who kidnaps a young boy on a road trip through the panhandle of Texas circa 1963. Eastwood leads the manhunt as the Texas Ranger who knows all too well Butch Haynes' (Costner in his best role so far) plan of action. What could easily have been a formulaic cops and robbers chase turns into a surprisingly warm friendship between captor and victim with a charming ease, reminiscent of "Shane". Low-key performances and a steady, rustic look enhances a flawless film that allows its characters many facets including some unexpected shifts of behavior for all principals. Lowther is innocence personified and shows a remarkable display of acting for an 8 year old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st watched 2/19/2002 - 9 out of 10(Dir-Clint Eastwood): Very well done narrative of a hunt between a fugitive(Costner) and a posse(Eastwood) that becomes confused when a boy is taken as a hostage and Costner wins him over as a friend. Just like the Oscar winning "The Unforgiven", Eastwood takes his time with this story and wins you over with the characters and the story. In my book, this is actually better than the Oscar-winner but seemed almost over-looked after the career-shaping picture for Eastwood. The acting all-around is superb from the big stars to the little boy who is befriended and the fearless direction by Eastwood is evident throughout. Late in his career he has been taking chances and showing his true ability to direct, and tell a story as well as act. Chalk another one up for the well-rounded talent of mayor/actor/director Clint Eastwood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just love this film. It touched me deeply. I had a lump in my throat for many hours after seeing it. But isn't that what making movies is all about - appealing to your emotions.Kevin Costner supplies us with his best performance ever as the run-away prisoner Butch Haynes, but he still does not match the debut performance of T.J. Lowther who plays the child hostage of Haynes'. This kid's behaviour is the most believable and lovable that I have ever seen coming out of Hollywood. There is no wise-cracking hero-stuff from him. Instead he is afraid, shy and everything you would expect from an 11 year old boy. I love that boy and he alone is worth all your money. See that movie please. Rating: 10 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Vision of an Imperfect World.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nature versus nurture. Fathers versus sons. Justice versus The Law. T-bones versus tater tots.The power of Clint Eastwood's films has always come from Eastwood's bravado in addressing moral ambiguity. (Even his death-dealing avenger films - the *Dollar* trilogy, etc. - are so powerful not because of his avengers' acts of righteousness, wrath or revenge, but because the camera never shies away from the darkness of its "heroes.") Of all the films Eastwood has directed and/or starred in, *A Perfect World* is the first where he has willfully removed his domineering presence from the limelight of the leading role, thereby allowing a clearer vision of the themes so often obscured by his camera-hogging avengers.Set in the '60s, when it was still feasible to escape prison via a fashionable hole-in-the-wall, the story follows escapee Butch Haynes (Kevin Costner) and his young hostage, Philip (T.J. Lowther), keeping one step ahead of a manhunt across Texas helmed by Sheriff Red Garnett (Eastwood).As the story follows both hunter and hunted alternately, we realize that each is not a cut-and-dried representation of "good" or "evil" and by movie's end, director Eastwood and writer John Lee Hancock, as well as superbly nuanced performances by the cast, make us doubt exactly who the bad guy is.As implied from his rap sheet, Butch seems to possess the genes for his profession ? but the question arises (via Laura Dern's criminologist, Sally Gerber, saddled on Red's manhunt for political reasons) as to whether Butch's broken home, prostitute mother or abusive father nurtured the low road.Like every psychotic who tries to assuage an unquenchable emptiness, Butch, "raised in a dime-a-dance whorehouse," with an ingrained suspicion for father figures due to his "old man not being worth a damn," develops a paternal instinct for his hostage, unconsciously becoming the father that he himself wished he had. When they steal a picnicking family's car, Butch chastises Philip for laughing at the father for surrendering the car so quickly, "Bob's a fine family man ? that's about the best thing a fella can hope to be."In his direct street vernacular, Butch schools Philip on the morals of stealing, the futility of religion, even reassuring him on his "puny pecker." It is scenes like this last one where Eastwood shows his mettle. He has never shied from "anti-social" elements (indeed, most of his characters are "anti-heroes"), yet in an over-sensitive society which pules at the slightest innuendo that imperils children physically or psychologically, Eastwood lets his camera play over scenes which would make a less talented director quake in his boots over the ensuing public outcry.The film moves at a rapid pace, the writing so sharp that Butch's psyche is revealed in almost every line of seemingly innocent dialog, one astounding scene establishing him as both didactic and insane, when he elucidates to his escape partner, Pugh, the difference between "threat" and "fact" in a nose-shattering lesson. When Pugh hisses, "I'm gonna kill you for that!" Butch replies: "And that's a threat." Pugh: "You're crazy!" Butch: "And that's a fact." Philip, whose father "ain't around," bonds with Butch as the powerful, albeit unbalanced, father that he finds he needs to segue into manhood. Lowther is brilliant in his heavily emotional role, retaining a sad and trusting ingenuousness and never bowing to insufferably precocious or ingratiatingly cute. And though the film poises to degenerate to the clich of both protagonists finding in each other what was missing from their lives, the resolution of their relationship is as far from Disney as Clint Eastwood is from Ryan Seacrest.We discover that Red Garnett may have been responsible for Butch's low road, as he confesses to Sally that when Butch was still a juvenile, it was Garnett who "bought that judge a t-bone and told him to send the boy up" for four years for a small crime, believing it would curb young Butch's criminal leanings. He was wrong. The ineffectuality of the criminal justice system is obvious (rehabilitation simply being a taxpayers' black hole, serving as delayed recidivism), working against the very people it supposedly serves ? the cops *and* the robbers. Red, like Butch, would have been damned either way.The Perfect World of the title may refer to nothing more than Butch's dim idea of a goal ? Alaska ? which he bases on a lone postcard from his no-good dad; one perfect picture representing a life Butch will never attain. But it may also refer to the kind of life Butch tries to make for himself in the present. Even though his paternal instincts eventually flare up into psychosis, which proves his undoing, for one brief moment, Butch seemed to have it all: he got to impose his notions of parenthood on parents who took their influential roles for granted; he got to play the role of a father himself and, most importantly, he gained the unconditional love of a child who made him feel like his "parenting" was a success.The final scenes, involving the gaff-taped family and Philip's wrenching decisions and devotion to Butch are as disturbing as they are moving. And as the stirring score of Clint regular, Lennie Niehaus, accompanies Clint's trademark final camera pan over the landscape, Butch's unflappable last moments may signify that he has realized a final perfect wish in this imperfect world ? to die a free man.*A Perfect World* is one of Eastwood's best films.And that's a fact.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The bad guy isn't totally bad in this case.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cute T J Lowther stars as young Phillip, a Texas boy who's kidnapped by bad guy Kevin Costner to be used as a hostage and shield while he's on the run from good guy Clint Eastwood.Yet Phillip does not resent his kidnapper, in places he seems to enjoy the attention he gets from Costner. Seems he wants to get away from his Mom and teasing sisters. And he's really broken up at the end when he loses, as we knew he must, his friend in the final battle.The care and affection that Costner shows to the lad gives a human side to his bad-guy character. Makes him seem real, not one sided, with a good side as well as the bad side.With this role, Costner joins the ranks of those super macho stars who have done a role of caring for a boy in need of affection. See Mel Gibson in "Man Without a Face" caring for Nick Stahl. Or see Spencer Tracy in "Old Man and the Sea" caring for Felipe Pazos. And Dirk Bogarde in "Spanish Gardener" caring for Jon Whitleley.Odd little bit about this movie. When he's first kidnapped, Lowther's character Phillip hasn't got his pants on. Never gets any. Spends the whole movie running about in his white Jockeys. Maybe Costner's character didn't know how to buy pants for a boy? Costume department saving money?Anyhow, the lad's quite cute, but never seems to have made any more movies. The other two of course have gone on to many other movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had really looked forward to seeing "A Perfect World" and was excited when it finally came on television in the UK. Clint Eastwood is always a reliable director, I adore low-key character studies and it seemed as though it might have a very promising story at its core.The first twenty minutes or so are great. I was drawn into the film immediately and felt pity for Costner's character. Honestly, Eastwood manipulates the audience a bit in Costner's intro - after all, as we all know, prison characters are only likable if redeemed by acts of kindness, or by showing us "he isn't so bad after all." This happens in "A Perfect World" when Costner shows up bravely just in time to stop a woman from being raped and abused. However, it worked on me, and I liked his character.After that it sort of goes downhill. The movie becomes, to be honest, rather dull and unmoving. It could easily lose 30 minutes' worth of footage. Some subplots are unnecessary and the interaction between Costner and the boy, although fairly realistic, isn't altogether believable, and I was left feeling a bit underwhelmed by the time the film had ended.Overall it's good enough for a single viewing, but could have been a lot better. Eastwood's made much better character studies before and since, and I recommend those more so than I do "A Perfect World."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, But Too Unpleasant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost 15 years after first seeing this movie, an image or two in here still haunts me to this day, which is why I gave up ever watching this again after my second look on VHS 6-8 years ago. This is a powerful film, too powerful for me.What haunts me are the terrible expressions of fear on the face of the young boy who co-stars in this movie. The kid, "Phillip (Buzz) Perry" is memorably played by T.J. Lowther, an actor whose name I haven't seen since this movie. I guess he's mainly done TV. Those disturbing images of the horror on this kid's face as he witnesses tragic things are still too indelibly printed in my memory.Kevin Costner, Clint Eastwood, Laura Dern make up an impressive trio of adult actors who star in this story, which certainly is different from most "action" films. It isn't just scenes involving Lowther; there are other unpleasant episodes such as a different kid getting beaten by his father and the "hero" (Costner, playing really an anti-hero), dying in the end as "Buzz" looks on, are not always easy view.Along the way, we do get some humor and some very endearing moments. The politics is decidedly feminist with Dern's cop role, but I am using to seeing left- wing slants in movies and I like both Dern and her dad Bruce in most films. Eastwood almost always plays someone interesting, so there is a lot to like here, too, if you can put up with some nasty things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I respectfully disagree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to respectfully disagree with the above reviewer. The person states that Eastwood dealt respectfully with Jehovah's Witnesses. In fact, I am a member of that "infamous" religion. I went to see this movie with a group of my friends. We were so offended by the lies this movie perpetuated about our faith that we walked out halfway through. I believe it is the responsibility of the filmmaker to do at least minimal research. It was painfully obvious that no one involved in the making of this film did any research into the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses.I write this review in 2005, about a movie I walked out of in 1993. Here are the specific things that offended me: 1. The child asked his mother why he could not go out to trick-or-treat. The mother answered only that it was against their religion. I didn't expect a detailed explanation of our beliefs, but NO (and I mean NO) JW mother would give that as an answer to their child. I won't go into them, but we DO have reasons for not celebrating Halloween. Every JW parent explains these reasons to their children in ways that they can understand.2. The first one wasn't too bad. But it made me leery of what was to come... Costner's character asks the child if he had ever eaten cotton candy or been on a roller coaster. The child answered no as if he could not do that because of his religion. JWs do not object to having fun. I grew up in this faith and looked forward to going to Six Flags every year. My cousins and I rode every roller coaster we could get onto, often begging the park workers to let us ride again without going back through the line. My family went to baseball games, to local carnivals, deep sea fishing, snorkeling, to college football games, to secluded beaches, and traveled to foreign countries ... all for fun. We played sports, games, watched movies, listened to music, danced, had cookouts ... I hope you're getting the picture that I never lacked any kind of decent fun. But, no, I didn't do drugs, overindulge in alcohol or ever have a teen pregnancy scare ... the things many people experience in the name of "fun." 3. The final straw that made us walk out was a scene between the boy and Costner. The boy stole a Halloween mask, had the chance to escape, but chose instead to go with Costner. When Costner asked the boy why he got into the car, the boy responded, "Because I was afraid of going to hell." It is one of our most basic teachings that God does not punish people forever in a burning hell. The idea of a burning hell is very offensive to us. Having the boy utter this statement was like having a Jew in Nazi Germany say, "I came along because I think Hitler has some interesting things to say - more people should listen to him."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stern reality takes over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood stars and directs A Perfect World where he plays a Texas Ranger. But he yields top actor billing to Kevin Costner playing a fugitive who takes 8 year old T.J. Lowther as a hostage. This was as it should have been because Costner has way more screen time than Eastwood.Costner and Keith Szarabajka escape from maximum security and kill a prison official and steal his car, the first of many stolen vehicles Costner will take. His second car exchange comes with young T.J. Lowther as well when Costner and Szarabajka stop at his mother's place.Young Lowther is being raised by a Jehovah Witness mom who forbids him a lot of what kids consider normal. After a bit he starts to bond with Costner who had a similar deprived childhood under vastly different circumstances. For a while Costner and Lowther view this escape as quite an adventure. But of course stern reality takes over.Although Eastwood is good his part is fairly one dimensional. A lot of it has to do with integrating newly assigned criminologist Laura Dern into his manhunt team, accent on man. Eastwood's an old school law enforcement guy, but some around him are of an even older school.The scenes with Costner and Lowther are the highlight of the film. The two really get a special chemistry going courtesy of director Eastwood.For those who like actor Eastwood they will be shortchanged. But director Eastwood is right on the job here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Manhunt Story With An Original Twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Under the penmanship of John Lee Hancock, may feel like the typical action-packed manhunt film with all the formulaic elements you find in this specific genre directed with a refreshing outlook by screen legend Clint Eastwood. And sure the repetitive malarkey psychological babble does come into effect about youths gone bad and the final sequences seems to take forever to end. Set in the year 1963, in the rural dwellings in Texas, one might be surprised that this crime-thriller isn't the typical run of the mill fast-paced, gun-slinging, car- chasing crime story, but more of a character- driven tale that tackles some very serious issues like parenting, uninspiring father-figures, and the rapidly changing ways the law enforcement handles their business. Long time Texas Ranger Sheriff Red Garnett (Clint Eastwood) is assigned by a governor to capture two convicted felons who escaped from a Huntsville prison where they kidnapped a fatherless young boy named Philip Perry (T.J. Lowther) who lives with his mother (Jennifer Griffin) who's very dedicated towards her faith as a Jehovah's Witness. Red hides out in a hi-tech Airglide trailer home as a follows the criminals down the highways and byways and send them back into the slammer. The two deviants are the psychologically unstable Terry Pugh (Keith Szarabajka) and career criminal Butch Gaynes (Kevin Costner). To supervise the pursuit, the governor assigns criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern) plus they also hire a sniper (Bradley Whitford), while Red's assistant Tom Adler (Leo Burmester) to take over radio controls as another deputy takes over the wheels. Butch terminates Terry in a cornfield after uttering threats towards Phillip. The resourceful boy can see that Butch is not a deranged lunatic like his partner Terry and Butch becomes an oddly developed father-figure with the boy. During breaks from their run from the fuzz, Butch takes Phillip to buy him some clothes from a redneck general store. The kid confiscates a Casper The Friendly Ghost costume and prefers the company of Butch rather than the stay in the store while the cops are after Butch.Before we ever met any of the characters, it seems that Red and Butch have met before. When Red was the sheriff if Amarillo, Red incarcerated Butch due to him stealing a car while going off on a carefree joyride. But Red as hard-lined as he is also has some compassion in Butch feeling that a four year jail sentence is tamer than having him return to his abusive felon father and his floozy, deadbeat mother. Butch has a pretty bad track record. When he was eight, he killed a man in his mother's defense, and literally got away with murder. Even though Butch has a liking for this kind kid, his dark side can never fully escape him and the bad decisions he makes still get the best of him. As the cops eventually catch onto him, Phillip thinks this manhunt was a learning experience to him and that this hard-luck convict could have been spared if state institutions knew how to fully operate the way it should. In the end, Red tells the legal system, figuratively to "stick it" and shows no empathy to hypocritical and those bastard cops who are just as corrupt as the criminals they arrest. Overall it's a very provocative film with a feeling of a western with the cinematography, only it's not in the same league as the typical shoot-em-up action crime film, but a human story with more advancements on character development.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of those rare movies that manage to use the strengths of all involved. First, this is the very best of Clint Eastwood both as a director and actor. Eastwood the director learned his trade from Don Siegel, who made a bunch of no-nonsense 70's action films, many of them with Eastwood as the star. Eastwood learned his trade well from the master. He can edit the fat out of a film very effectively. Eastwood the actor really shines in this film as well in a supporting role as a Texas Ranger at the tail end of a career doing a kind of slow burn as events unfold around him.The story flow feels a little bit choppy, and not having watched other Eastwood-directed films, I'm not sure where the majority of the blame falls. The editing is simple and to the point, which occasionally makes shots feel too obvious, but again, after only one viewing, I don't have the problem completely pinpointed yet. The darkness brings the story to very believable light, but there are also some more complex relationships and themes in A Perfect World. Savannah Smiles is about two crooks changing their ways. This film is about fatherhood, or at least the fatherhood role. And in contrast to the film's title, fathers aren't always perfect. One thing, however, that this movie shouts perfectly clearly is a call to men: boys look to those around them for mentors. And even if you're a murdering, stealing, lying crook, there's quite likely some young boy who sees something you do, and thinks "I want to be like that." Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1963 Halloween night, Texas right before JFK's arrival. Robert 'Butch' Haynes (Kevin Costner) and Jerry Pugh escape from prison in Huntsville. Pugh breaks into a family home and they escape by taking the boy Phillip Perry hostage. Phillip's mother is a Jehovah's Witness and she forbids her children to participate in Halloween. Phillip doesn't know his father and soon Butch becomes a male role model for the boy. Texas Rangers Red Garnett (Clint Eastwood) and Tom Adler are on the chase. The Governor sends over an airstream trailer and criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern) to help. FBI agent Bobby Lee tags along in the manhunt.Kevin Costner delivers the perfect combination of menace and caring. The boy is a great foil to him. Eastwood, Dern, and the others give the light comic relief. Costner and boy could have been in their own indie. Their relationship is touching with great moments of underlying tension. The Eastwood side of the movie is a little more lighter. The overt comedic scenes take some of the tension away. It's probably the lesser side but it's still plenty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good getaway story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Butch (Kevin Costner) escapes from prison, takes a little boy named Phillip hostage, and leads the police (headed by Clint Eastwood) on a 2-day chase through rural Texas. The boy forms a close bond with his kidnapper who turns out to be a compassionate, though flawed, man.This is a very good movie with some humor and a lot of suspense. Butch and Phillip's scenes are pure gold, extremely well-written and believable. Kevin Costner gives an excellent, subtle, and sympathetic performance. Seven-year old T. J. Lowther is perfect as the boy who sees the getaway as a fun and grown-up adventure; he's endearing without being too-sweet. The movie alternates between Butch and Phillip and their pursuers, and while Eastwood is good as the steely Texas Ranger, Laura Dern is just annoying in a thankless role as a scowling criminologist. I would have given the movie 10 stars if all of the scenes without Butch and Phillip were deleted; they are wonderful together and the rest of the cast is just there to pad the movie.Directed by Eastwood, the film is ultimately a sad one but Costner and Lowther are outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lot to like about this movie. Kevin Costner is very good. I don't think I've seen him better in a movie. He still isn't the best actor, but when it comes to portraying an athlete ("Tin Cup", "Bull Durham", "Field of Dreams") or a crook, he seems to be more than up to the task. Costner's natural athleticism (he played college baseball at Cal State Fullerton-one of the top baseball programs in the country) may perhaps give him the lean, natural grace which lends itself to conveying the image of an accomplished athlete. Costner's emotional range remains limited-perhaps that is what makes him best suited to being an athlete or a crook, but nevertheless, this is still a good performance.The scenery in this film (central Texas) should receive an acting credit, so beautiful is it. The depiction of said scenery is gorgeous, conveying an open freedom into which the escaped convict and his hostage escape-albeit very languorously.The plot of the film is that escaped convict Butch (Costner) breaks out of prison, and when an attempt to steal a Ford goes awry, he ends up with an 8-year-old hostage (the very talented TJ Lowther as Buzz) and he goes on the lam. He is pursued by Texas Marshal Red Garnett (Clint Eastwood), an old-fashioned marshal with a nose for catching the bad guys. He is assisted by the more forward-looking criminologist Sally Gerber (Laura Dern) who looks more toward evidence and thinks that new forms of technology and a close analysis of prior behavior and criminal traits. Even though Gerber and Garnett clash, they respect each other's professionalism and are both clearly accomplished law enforcement officials.Clint Eastwood gives a fair performance, but more importantly as director, he keeps the action going at a good pace. I did think that the notion that if Butch reserved so much anger for people who mistreated children, that he could control it so well, was a bit difficult to swallow. I also found it a bit strange that the child didn't leave his abductor when he had chances. It would seem that Buzz had ingested some degree of Stockholm Syndrome. That said, Butch's anger does seem quite specifically (at child abusers) focused. The bond between Butch and Buzz is at the heart of the movie and it is eminently plausible. The setting of 1963 is beautifully conveyed in every way. A lot of kudos must go to art direction and the costume department.Clint Eastwood has shown himself since this film to be interested in the world and society. He delves into history and society and depicts slices of life with great passion, and perhaps more importantly, with an open mind. Consequently, he has made some thoughtful and interesting films. Some films may work better than others, but they're worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good but kinda pointless....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it hard to critique this movie. There isn't really anything wrong with it, except that is has no real point to make. Actually, it has a point, but somehow Clint Eastwood, as masterful a director as he is, was not able to effectively communicate it. Or perhaps this is the script's weakness... I cannot make up my mind so we'll leave it as this - a very well written but ambiguous script that Clint perfectly recorded on film, without fully comprehending its subtext. I originally saw this in the theatres and was disappointed. But I know that my disappointment was a result of anticipation, because CLint had made Unforgiven and Costner Dances with Wolves. So when I saw the previews, I thought "this is gonna be a masterpiece, more Oscars for everyone!!". But it wasn't. What I saw instead was a very restrained and quite touching film that barely starred Clint. So now, 12 years later, I rented it on DVD, ready to now enjoy the film, without the misguided anticipation, as I should have in 93. Yet somehow, I had the same disappointed feelings. I enjoyed the film - first rate cinematography, excellent use of locations, wonderful depiction of Texas in the 60's, great cast, fine dialogue, precise editing etc... BUT NO POINT. Clint Eastwood has turned out to be one of the great American film directors. He shows amazing restraint and astounding sensitivity, with a keen eye for composition, and tasteful aesthetics. This is no exception. Costners gives one of his best performances, going against type and actually anchors the whole film (I have a feeling CLint's role shoulda been way smaller than it was). The boy, Buzz, is wonderful. I hate most child actors and performances, but this one is excellent, simply because the kid is real and believable, not because of any inherent talent (like Dakota Fanning for example). Laura Dern is also great in an under-emphasized role. The main problem here is that this skillfully filmed story only touches the surface of its themes - morality, justice, professional and human relations. The characters were created in order to deal with these issues, but they cannot, given that half of them (Clint and Dern) do not get enough screen time to delve into the themes. The father-son relationship between Costner and the boy is touching, but not enough to give the movie its point and weight. I kept waiting for something a little more philosophical and cerebral. For instance the theme of modernization, embodied in the new high tech trailer and the discussions of policing methods, goes nowhere, fast. When it is mentioned that their tools will be used to protect Pres Kennedy when he arrives for his infamous Dallas parade, I thought, OK here comes some political-historical subtext - but it never came... The theme of moral ambiguity, remains, well, ambiguous. But this is not like the euthanasia in Million Dollar Baby, where CLint lets the viewer make the moral judgment. Because of the sweet relationship between Costner and the boy, our judgment becomes muddled, because we are cheering for them. Then what about CLint, Dern, and the cops? Their roles remain so underdeveloped, it is impossible to use the characters as our cinematic moral measuring stick. So, in conclusion, this is a fine and quite watchable movie, that might leave you feeling unsatisfied because it doesn't quite stimulate the mind as it should, but rather effectively stimulates the emotions, which I feel should be secondary in this film, with this story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in Texas during the days just after Halloween 1963, the movie opens with Butch Hayes (Kevin Costner) reposing in the tall, green grass, a peaceful look on his face, and $10 and $20 bills blowing across him in the wind of a helicopter above him. What's going on here? That's the story the movie is about to tell. SPOILERS WILL BE IN THE REST OF MY COMMENTS. We don't know why he is there, but Butch and another prisoner are working on an escape by removing a grill and going through a wall. Outside the building they hijack a deputy and his car to be driven out the Huntsville prison. His partner is rotten. Not content with just shooting holes in rural water tanks they pass, he gets rough with a woman they are hitting up for food. There is a brief tussle involving an elderly neighbor with a shotgun, but the two escapees leave with an 8-year-old boy as a hostage. Soon, in a corn field, the other escapee is left behind with a bullet through his head after troubling the boy. The boy, who was raised by his Jehova Witness mom, and not allowed for example to take part in Halloween, actually begins to embrace the experience of running with Butch. It is the first time he is treated as someone important, and is able to have some fun. While on the run they meet and get to know a number of different people, Butch seems like a nice person, we wonder why he is a criminal. He plans to head for Alaska, but after a few days of being on the run, the boy only wants to go home. After an encounter with a family left tied up, the boy shoots and wounds Butch. The boy sets out, Butch follows him into the field where the movie started. The boy managed to get Butch to give himself up but while Butch reaches for the money we saw at the beginning, a sharp shooter kills him.The other concurrent story has Clint Eastwood as Chief Red Garnett, Ranger leading the manhunt for the escapees in a pirated silver van pulled by a pickup truck. Against his desires, he is aided by Sally Gerber (Laura Dern), a criminologist from Huntsville sent by the governor to catch the crooks. Red does things the old fashioned way, following his instinct of the moment. Sally refers to him as "the hillbilly Sherlock Holmes." But they end up working together, and gaining mutual respect. As the movie ends, they both punch the sharp shooter, disappointed that they could not bring their man in alive.A different type of movie, often dialog driven, with really fine performances by the lead actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me, A Perfect World was a fascinating essay on the irreconcilable tension between being drawn to someone with star quality or charisma and being repulsed by someone, sometimes the same person, who is evil.The Costner character is smart and charming, and he's not out of reach of redemption. The little boy, who I think represents the audience (think of Shane or The Shootist), grows to like his abductor. But the guy is a violent criminal escapee. The ending was tough, because the movie is showing us the nastiness the guy is capable of and it's hard to take. But it's true to the lesson here: we admire people for their charms not their morals.An entertaining and involving story. I generally avoid Kevin Costner, but this movie shows that he is a fine actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually I can see both sides when there are differences of opinion about something. This is one of those rare cases where I simply cannot, because this film seems outstanding to me and (try as I might) it is hard to understand how anyone would not find it at least "very good". I do agree that the ending was too melodramatic and far fetched, but by then the major points of the movie had been made with care and feeling, the acting had been accomplished brilliantly, the characters had all revealed themselves skillfully, the story was essentially buttoned up, and I was very touched by it all. So, I can forgive a little over the top-ism (inasmuch as Hollywood usually seems to have to take us there). Seldom do I recommend films strongly to others, because I feel they have their own tastes and plenty of sources of information and reviews, without my adding to their database. This movie I bought, have loaned out, and tell people about at the drop of a hat. It is that good. I only wonder why something like this would not have been a "best picture" nominee.

The only thing that makes it worth watching is the bond between Costner and Lowther. For the rest it's all downhill. Okay we all know that cops are not the brightest people on earth, but here in this movie they are almost borderline retarded. If that's how a man on the run has to be caught then they won't catch a lot of fugitives. And this one doesn't even make real attempts to escape, he's just cruising around with the boy.

		<shortDescription>Not so perfect indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie denies the simplistic idea of good and bad that presents bad characters as totally evil and good characters as totally good. Kevin Costner performs here the role of someone who is a delinquent killer, an escaped convict who kidnaps a small boy as an hostage to feel protected in his escape but shows very good feelings and sentiments in the course of events that follows. His relationship with the boy develops itself as deeply sentimental on both sides since the boy becomes very friendly with his captor also because he is getting an earnest education from his mother who is a Jehovah's Witness and deprives him and her other children of much of the fun that children use to enjoy and now he begins to feel more free in the company of his captor than at home. In terms of action the movie is a bit lukewarm in the beginning and till its middle but in the last third it develops itself in rather dramatic and moving scenes which make it worth to be seen. In conclusion: not a very good movie but a good enough one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kinda floats along</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film which takes in the genre of the buddy movie, albeit taking a different slant on it and adding the element of a road trip as both the central characters reflect on what they have missed and subsequently experience elements of what they missed in their childhoods.Good cast but the it does just float along and never really takes off at any degree and seems somewhat flat all the away along to what seems an inevitable conclusion.There does seem a lack of energy throughout the film and this may go back to the two primary actors in this film with Eastwood who stars as a supporting actor, also directed this and by all accounts Costner was not a fan of Eastwoods directorial style. Eastwood is famous for speed, quick decision making and keeps the film rolling. Costner by all accounts is quite the opposite and likes to (or did like to, at the time of Dances with Wolves) take his time, and direct films in a more painstaking fashion. So very much two opposites meeting and two men that have not worked together since I believe. Mind you, one went and hit further heights and the others career slowed down a bit from the heights he was at around the time of this film.Lacks excitement and could have had more life to it really, and I am a big Eastwood fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kid, The Criminal and the Ugly Parents (adults, bosses and various selfish and destructive adults)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My father and I share few things in common: the other women in our immediate family (different perspective on them entirely) and a mutual love for Mel Brooks and Clint Eastwood. His favorite is Bridges of Madison County, while mine is A Perfect World.The following analysis is purely from my unique perspective and not actually a review where I would use phrases like "entirely watchable movie", assert that obvious anomalies concerning the color of the leaves in Autumn versus Spring would be considered by any actor, scriptwriter or very honest and thorough filmmaker who doesn't have a capricious cell in his body, as anything but a more personal message that is meant for one who looks for the man's real sense of responsibility and care in its CAREFULLY DRAWN AND EDITED PRESENTATION, as the only possible result one could expect here: Because he is where he certainly worked at and for many years longer than most of these reviewers have lived. Sorry but you really just have to try a little harder to be appreciative of most things in general as you grow up, but I had to read your stuff with the same standards as everyone else. Because child abuse, molestation, choosing personal ego issues first before the child's well being, every single time (as illustrated by the result of mom's need to reject the whole neighborhood on Halloween by opening the door and refusing candy to children, who, in turn, stone that fragile bird with water balloons over religious crap that they cannot understand.Mom needs no further character development.)People who are fake, grating on the ears to listen to and more than obviously unconcerned when faced with a boy dressed in a long sleeved shirt and underpants. They are familiar and equally unfit to burden a child's afternoon with, have no spine and are gross people that never spend a minute in prison or in psychotherapy for the adults that he can no longer allow to do it without one really big humiliation they certainly deserve. Butch and the Bird Boy (Buzz for Clint)have only 2 hours to throw a whole lot of pain and Wilderness dues at an audience that is worth telling it to in his very "Bill Collins", end of the world for AT LEAST ONE PERSON style. Artists who truly respect their muses and ALL of their audience in such a classy and unpretentious manner are seldom given a personal thank you from some "terrible people" here in Tucson that also did a little work in film a while back. Butch's profile quickly and briefly stated by Clint is, by the obvious nature of the character we take a drive with at the worst time in his life, decidedly fictional and exaggerated to see if the audience is paying attention at all. Ivan the Terrible seems manic depressive and promiscuous by comparison. He breaks out with his cellie, whom he knows is an @$$hole at best yet doesn't desert him until he has revealed that he is a child molester. There are men doing lots of time in prison as a cumulative result of all the adults who failed to do right by the child after the fact. My husband began his incarcerated life at around 18 when he robbed the gas station and shot at, but didn't kill, the x cop and hockey coach his parents never tried to put away. Sometimes those men that do get caught and imprisoned still manage to get killed in a very dramatic way regardless of the protective custody they always get. Some people just need to be taken out in some circles, those who don't suffer cannot be given such an opportunity and let another kid get hurt. What a scary man to be rescued by. No wonder that boy has his back the whole time, regardless of all the candy and mommy stuff those hunters thought all kids needed beyond the occasional ritalin to keep them from disrupting their adult responsibilities and need for manipulation to get their attention- something Butch always earned rather quickly no matter how cruel he could be when under extreme stress for a man who handles it his own way. I think I've said more than I needed to yet my private and unpublished stuff is still not really public enough to let all the actors, filmmakers and freaks in Hollywood, as well as musicians who routinely get too much "I'm not impressed" these days for me to attempt one very big THANKS, I NEEDED THAT MORE.Tto say that life sustaining entertainment is as good as we deserve for the pain and now grown up need to be at most kinder to those who are more insane and miserable than we could ever be. Almost forgiving in other's eyes (He's much better at that) but not at all too good for them to let them know in my direct and generous way that I won't allow them to ever feel comfortable with it. We adults that never get the showdown or the meadow lands we would rather roll around in just to do what most never appreciate when it's just too easy not to, I believe , still were fortunate enough to see the value in the total lack of sympathy or admission from most that they just aren't really worth it. TATONKA! Thanks for speaking my language.</fullReview>

This film may have flaws, but I'm not looking for them. I'm engaged, entwined, entirely convinced.

I'm sure I'd miss most of it. A lot of what's good about this, and any other film, can't be articulated anyway.So I'll just summarize it, as it relates to me.

		<shortDescription>Domestic social issues of America portrayed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it was released in 1993 and had the opportunity to see it again recently. A good movie stands the test of time and this is one is better second time around. Although it is a tad slow paced, especially for an 'escaped prisoner' themed movie (cf. 'Fugitive' and 'US Marshalls'), it does go much deeper than merely the good guys chasing the bad guys.Kevin Costner plays the fugitive convict who takes a young boy hostage as he attempts to flee across the state border. Clint Eastwood is the Texas Ranger in pursuit along with Laura Dern who plays the criminologist lending a hand (or brain). The chase throws up themes and subthemes as a bond between convict and the boy evolves.The movie tackles the issues facing 1950s America that still hold unchanged today. Broken families with abusive fathers and single mothers, domestic violence, the juvenile justice system, crime and punishment and fringe religions are all are examined and challenged. The American belief system of family, righteousness, truth and justice no longer hold true in a not so Perfect World. A line that sums up the changing American landscape - when the boy (Phillip) admits never to haven eaten cotton candy because of his family's belief as a Jehovah's witness, Costner fires back the retaliatory remark `Phillip, you have a goddamn red white and blue American right to eat cotton candy and ride roller coasters'.Costner gives a fine performance and easily overshadows Eastwood. In fact, the latter looks tired and bored throughout the movie. Costner seems to thrive when he plays 'ordinary white America' kind of roles ('JFK', 'Bull Durham', 'Tin Cup') and this is no exception. Laura Dern is the not merely a token female in this predominantly white male picture and her role as an intelligent and capable criminologist highlights the issue of feminism and the increasing participation and success of women in America's workforce. However, her performance is average at best. T.J. Lowther as the seven year old hostage is quite impressive.The ending is rather clichd but well made up for by the excellent camera work throughout the movie, ala Kubrick style. Overall, the movie earns a 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's Boldest Direction of a Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout this movie you ask yourself, Is the Clint Eastwood directing this? Is that Kevin Costner? I am a huge fan of Eastwood's direction in film, and this one frankly surprised me.This beautiful movie dives deep in the emotions of an escaped convict and his choices in life. Every shot is meticulously thought out, as Eastwood presents what some would say a Kubrick style film. The message of life through this dark movie slows the pacing at times, but is rewarded by Costner's acting. Kevin's films have been all but impressive over the last few years, but this performance stands out in my mind as his best. The ending is a tad bit off key with the rest of the film, but I understand why it was ended that way, it just could have been rewritten a few times.This was one of the most psychological films of the early 90's and Eastwood's greatest as a director. He was able to bring it all together, the acting, the Cinematography, and the story to make a real film. Eastwood was on a roll with Unforgiven, A Perfect World, and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. If you love the films of Eastwood, be sure to give this one a look. It is worth the time.</fullReview>

He portrayed a very dark side and a very good side. He really identified with the boy he kidnapped because they had similar backgrounds.

		<fullReview>Kevin Costner is often criticised for his acting ability but in this movie he is absolutely magnificent as prison escapee, Butch Haynes. While his attitude to his young hostage, Phillip, softens as the film progresses, his treatment of other characters remains threatening throughout. The time spent in the home of Mac is some of the most powerful film-making I have ever seen. Is he going to shoot him or not? The suspense has you hanging on the edge of your seat. An earlier writer criticised the ending as a "bleeding heart cliche". I disagree. Given the way the characters have developed through the film there really is no other way for the story to end. It fits perfectly. The only weaknesses in this film are the performances of Eastwood (who is wooden beyond belief) and Dern (who comes across as an over-acting idiot). Fortunately they're not featured too often. Costner steals the show with a powerful, intense and totally believable performance. Watch this film.

		<fullReview>I have been a Costner fan since about 1987 when I first saw No Way Out. I have always thought him incredibly handsome and totally believable in everything he does. However, this movie was so different in anything I had seen him in before that it really knocked me out how versatile he can be. All through it I felt a great amount of pity for him, but not as much as the last 20 minutes that I consider totally heart-wrenching. You really believe that he came to love that little boy, played brilliantly by Tim Lother, and when he was killed, part of me died also. I originally saw it in the movies and could not leave for about 15 minutes after it ended, that's how moved I was. I have since purchased the film and have watched it many times always feeling the same way each time. It is a shame that Mr. Costner did not receive more credit for this wonderful performance. I would recommend this movie to anyone, whether you are a Costner fan or not. It was great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seen this film at the cinema when it came out in 93' and was blown away with it then. I simply cannot understand why Costner was never nominated for an Oscar for this film, his performance and that of the kid he kidnaps is understated and superb and IMO, his greatest ever...The story, pretty simple, but it's the relationship with the boy that takes over the film. I'd agree that Dern shouldn't be in this film, and adds nothing to it (like all of her roles to be honest)... however, as a package, it's simply perfect 10/10.Do not miss this, all they need is a remasted DTS DVD version, and I'll be first in the q!!!

		<shortDescription>One of Eastwood's miracles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven's seen this movie, what are you waiting for? If you have, you know what I'm talking about, at least I hope you do. I consider this movie as Kevin Costner's best performance after the "Dances with Wolves" (in which he was also the director). This film goes side to side, with some other Eastwood's miracles ("Mystic River", "Million Dollar Baby"). Eastwood is also in it but he has put himself aside, so that Costner and little T.J. Lowther could show us what a great actors they are. Primarily, this movie talks about friendship, but it also shows us, how fragile our lives are, and how we should appreciate what we have. With all that, it also includes a little dose of humor, which concludes this great movie! If you ask me, it is a shame not to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful performance by a boy actor. The boy, Philip, is trust into a nightmare situation, but draws upon sufficient strength to keep on going. Butch, a fugitive criminal, behaves erratically; at times with great sensitivity towards Philip and other children, and at other times with complete disregard for the emotional effect of his terrifying actions. This film is otherwise a fairly plain, but not too stereotyped, Hollywood fantasy story of a fugitive on the run.</fullReview>

Butch hates the parental violence he sees inflicted by adults to their children, and has no mercy on such adults {and, I might add, rightfully so...our children are our gems, not burdens}. So that hand-holding scene becomes even more poignant.I love how Butch's life philosophies are sprinkled...rationalizing how stealing is OK when absolutely needed, how he can't explain how his kissing a woman's rear is something he can't explain, how a boy should be allowed to eat cotton candy and go to the fair, and how he only killed 2 people in his life {that needed killing}.I'd like to see how Billy turned out ten years later.Why no Oscar nominations? {Those type of omissions annoy me, like no nomination for Robert Shaw as Quint in Jaws.}BTW, great music throughout too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A crash course in manhood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Clint Eastwood's *A Perfect World*, all types of masculinity are put on display for our perusal. There is the disarming innocence of a young child (T.J. Lowther, in a thoroughly welcome un-actorly performance). There is the rugged decency of the old-fashioned "Man of the West", as perfectly depicted by Eastwood himself in the supporting role of the Texas Ranger. The smaller roles also give us widely contrasting views: the loyal good-old-boy, in the person of Eastwood's 2nd-in-command; the stupid predator who accompanies Costner in his prison-break; the smart predator in the form of an "assisting" FBI agent; the nice, simple, young fellows who drive Eastwood's crew around; the farmer who is friendly outside his home but is a violent tyrant within it; the henpecked family man who allows his wife to administer the corporal punishment. . . .(Almost) all of these possible role models offer examples for fatherless little Philip, the son of a widowed mother. But it is Costner's Butch Haynes, his kidnapper, who embodies the widest variety of the masculine kaleidoscope. Philip is clearly looking for a father figure, and Butch, looking for the same, responds to his own lifetime's worth of psychological anguish by cramming almost an entire boyhood's worth of fathering, mentoring, and big-brothering onto the lad. Writer John Lee Hancock proves to be an adroit observer of the male dynamic (note how Butch gives Philip the unlikely sobriquet "Buzz" -- a nickname very similar to his own). Needless to say, director Eastwood is also a student of masculinity and its discontents. Writer and director are a seamless pair here, limning not only the "importance of fathers" but the fruitlessness of a certain macho mind-set in an increasingly dehumanizing modern world -- the biggest symbol of which is the ludicrously apt mobile-home police trailer that carts Eastwood and his team across Texas, with its depressing accouterments of modernity such as air conditioning, refrigerator, and channel-to-channel radio. The movie is set in 1963, just before the Kennedy assassination. The setting is clearly designed to evoke the last cusp of America's innocence before the deluge of the Sixties and our current "post-modern" dilemma. The old America, the old way of life, had become a dead-end road. Butch and Philip encounter that dead-end prosaically when their journey is stopped at one point by the end of a paved highway. But they also discover that dead-ends are made up of more than just pavement: one can't get lost in Texas anymore, not when sinister, silver, mobile police trailers with are hunting you down. Butch carries a postcard of Alaska in his pocket: this represents a "last frontier", a place where his own father last wrote to him, but it's a place within Butch's imagination. There are no more frontiers in 1963. Meanwhile, Eastwood's Red Garnett grills the steaks that had been refrigerated in his ultra-modern mobile unit on an improvised barbecue after the trailer crashes off the side of the road. Garnett is like some mythical cowboy, desperately trying to get back to the basics, to something that makes sense, to something simple. Garnett is Butch's shadow-father, just as Butch will perhaps be a life-long shadow-father to Philip. *A Perfect World* suggests that blood does not always make kinship. A shared sensibility can create even more haunting bonds.How does one discuss great movies like these? I've wandered all over the place, here. Sometimes, one has to ditch the essay-style, and just express his/her impressions and feelings about a work of art. I'll leave the cogent, logical arguments to others. There's much I didn't have space to get to; you'll have to see the movie to find the other treasures. I'll finish by expressing my deepest admiration for the opening scene of the film: there's Kevin Costner, lying contentedly in the grass, the sun shining down on him. There is a child's Halloween mask near his arm -- Caspar the Friendly Ghost. Puzzlingly, several bank notes drift across the grass . . . but Costner looks contented. Meanwhile, in the sky, a bird flies across the path of the glowing sun. The title credit appears: *A Perfect World*. This scene is revisited at the end of the movie, to devastating effect: each of these elements will be laid bare for what they really mean; it will all make horrible sense. "I don't understand a damn thing" is the coda offered by the Texas Ranger. Nothing, clearly, is perfect in this world . . . though this movie comes pretty damn close.9 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

Most of the film isn't bad, although the chase hardly results in any suspense or thrills. In the final act, however, it falls apart with a ridiculous scene where Costner flashes his psychotic side and a conclusion that drags on too long and becomes overly melodramatic. Eastwood is not a director known for subtlety, but here he really goes overboard in driving home the point that Costner had a rough childhood and he won't stand for child abuse. The little boy is cute and Dern outperforms Costner and Eastwood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie's biggest asset is that despite its length, it manages to hold your interest. This is a commendable achievement, considering the outcome is quite predictable.The biggest problem I have with this film is that it seems to send the confusing message that child abuse is intolerable, but theft and murder can be excused or even justified. Several overly-contrived scenes of children being roughed-up by adults are used to assist with this theme. Please.I thoroughly enjoyed the performances of Costner and Lowther. It is the developing relationship between these two that gives the movie its punch. It also adds greatly to the impact of the moving, albeit melodramatic climax.On a lesser note, I was quite annoyed by the endless lighting of cigarettes by Costner's character. Can't directors find more creative ways to make their actors appear less self-conscious? Also, there was one too many references to the size of the boy's penis. Do seven-year-olds really care about that? And finally, why did Eastwood bother to star in this film? His character was an inconsequential dud.</fullReview>

Even 2 of the cops become convinced that the criminal is actually a good guy!

		<fullReview>"A Perfect world" (1993) is the kind of a motion picture that lefts me grappling with some rather conflicting feelings. I'm a huge fanatic when it comes to good old Mr. Eastwood and I've always admired him and his quite spectacular movies. Therefore it's always been a hard job to even say something bad about his flicks. It's also pretty difficult to claim this is a lousy film considering that it has an excellent acting (especially from C.E. himself) and it's a nice, firm and well-made work from Clint. I just don't like the most disappointing story, just like I didn't like the story of his next film "The Bridges of Madison County" (1995). Why is it that whenever I see Dirty Harry Callahan torturing his victims or Josey Wales spitting on a forehead of a corpse I find it rather amusing and entertaining but when a movie tries to make adultery acceptable (like in "The Bridges of Madison County") or represents religion as the biggest enemy I find it much harder to approve. There's no denying it, "A Perfect world" is basically a good movie but nevertheless it's my least favorite of Eastwood's works of the 90's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An imperfect movie, but watchable nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The project seems good on paper: Costner's on the run and takes a boy with him - he's trying to regain his freedom and redress the quasi-Oedipal imbalance churned up by his own neglectful father, which, we are led to believe, put him in the can in the first place. There's plenty for Eastwood to work with, not least as his casts himself in a sub-plot role designed to examine, and possibly excuse Texan machismo in another situation.I think that Costner is excellent - it's the sort of role, in the sort of period drama (1962) that he can really get to grips with. His support, Phil, is played with a the same engaging but ultimately directorial puppeteering as the spirited banker's son of Mary Poppins by TJ Lowther - but with an extra commitment in the gritty realism of his situation. Eastwood plays himself and I'm astonished by the sparks that his sparring with Laura Dern kicks up.But there are too many holes and leaps of faith to be made. The sub-plot and the main thrust never dovetail, even thematically. We know Costner must fail - his is a desparate, last ditch mission which has little to do with his actual jailbreak - but there's not a great enough undertow of pathos for us to understand this in the denoument. Some set piece scenes just don't work in situ either. There's enough to stimulate and carry the show off but it doesn't quite add up. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Valuable exploration of the many chambers of the human heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The temptation is natural to dig a deep, smug gulf between oneself and a criminal. It is so much more comfortable and reassuring to consider the latter as an inherent difference in kind, born evil, and somehow sub-human; than to assess the mixture of good and evil motives and potentials common to both.But this caricature is dangerous, for either an individual or a society indulging in it. Films, therefore, which cross the chasm by exploring an anti-hero's moral ambiguities are particularly commendable. I suspect also that they require unusual sensitivity and skill to produce from all concerned, as well as above-average courage, since they will have an uphill fight on the way to popularity.A Perfect World is such a film, and my hat is off to Clint Eastwood for the effort. As both actor and director, I think that he shows unappreciated subtlety. There is also humility here, as he takes a back seat on the screen to Kevin Costner and T.J. Lowther, both of whose acting is riveting (the latter not so much for delivery of lines, often deadpan, as for the amazing emotional intensity which this small boy summons in his face).It is not an entirely successful movie (does such a thing exist?). I agree with critics who found the interplay of characters in Eastwood's party of cops and politicos relatively too shallow and undeveloped to prepare us for the crucial confrontation at the end. And I felt that Costner's cruelty in the climactic scene was off-the-wall: under-provoked, overdone, and somewhat counterproductive by forcing us to conclude that he really did have to be put away for life after all. The boy's continued devotion to him after this could only testify to a gaping emotional hole in his upbringing.Anyone liking this film should try to see "Martin's Day" as well, and vice versa, as they are remarkably similar in situation and character development.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Eastwood's Weaker Efforts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder if Clint Eastwood would make this film differently if he had the opportunity. There's the basis for a good story here, but the film doesn't seem to know how to handle it so that, once escaped prisoner Kevin Costner hits the road with his little hostage in tow, the story seems to stop going forward. Costner is very good in the role of Butch, a petty career criminal whose fate is inextricably linked to the sheriff, played by Clint Eastwood, who is leading the manhunt for him. In fact, the character of Butch is well-written ? more so than any other of the characters, who all seem rather flat and unfocused in comparison. His accomplice in the prison escape is a strictly by-the-numbers bad guy, but at least he brought some life to the film while he was on screen.The story seems to be focused on the fact that the father makes the man, and prison discipline is no substitute for an absent father. Not exactly earth-shaking stuff, but the film seems to think so. It worries the subject like a dog growling at the bone clamped between its jaws while trying to develop a sense of pathos through the growing relationship between Butch and his captive. Of course, Butch sees echoes of himself in the fatherless Philip, the son of a devout Jehovah's Witness mother who refuses to allow him trick or treating. Tellingly, Philip (or Buzz, as he chooses to be called once free of his mother) spends much of the film dressed as a ghost.I don't like to criticise the performance of kids in films, but the young lad who plays Philip really needed a couple more years in drama school before appearing in front of the screen. The film's meandering pace shudders to a virtual halt in the last fifteen minutes, just when it should be working up a head of steam, and the finale seems to last forever. This is something of a surprise, because even when he's telling a slight tale, Eastwood usually manages the pacing of his films very well. On the positive side, the period detail is good, and the cinematography is first class.</fullReview>

Naturally Costner has, with the help of another convict, kidnapped a young boy. After Costner gets rid of his partner, he and the boy try to stay away from the authorities chasing them. Costner and the boy start to develop a loving father-son-styled relationship, but all this does is complicate things for Eastwood and company. Eastwood is never sure where he wants to go here and this means his direction lacks the pace and conviction it so desperately needed.

During their high speed adventure each man, eight year old Phillip and hardened crim Butch, grow to respect and trust one another. Phillip adopts Butch as the father he never had, while Butch treats the boy as he would have had his less than perfect father treat him.Costner is never asked to do a great deal and is thus not tested, while young T.J. Lowther easily outshines his giant co-star with a winning performance as the boy who has rushed from innocence to the edge of manhood in a few short days. As actor, Clint Eastwood never has enough to get his teeth into playing the local sheriff whose job it is to track down Haynes. And as director he can never lift John Lee Hancock's story to the heights that the writer obviously aspired to. Laura Dern is totally wasted in a support role. Cinematography form Jack N.

When Terry makes a move on the boy Phillip, Butch shoots him and continues on his way just the two of them. As they travel Butch and Phillip get to know each other and like each other. Meanwhile Chief Garnett has been put on the manhunt, along with a mobile home and an unwanted partner in Sally Gerber.Despite the heavy names in the cast list, this film is something of a strange beast; the basic plot sounds about as formulaic as they come, the running time is overlong and the whole thing is enjoyable without actually ever really coming to life with a spark. The formulaic plot, you will not be surprised to learn, sees Butch uncover his paternal side with Phillip while Garnett comes to have a bit of respect for his prey rather than his political masters. So nothing particularly new there then, and so it plods through it's padded running time with a reasonable air of familiarity but not contempt.While Butch and Phillip move across the state in an episodic adventure of meeting people and having little events where they grow closer, Garnett provides a semi-comic relief from the main tale - wisely, I thought, as it breaks up what would be very formulaic otherwise. The various little events that Butch and Phillip go through are pretty good - some act as action, some amusing and some are used to reveal the fact that Butch can as easily be unhinged as he can be paternal; it moves slower than it really needs to but it rarely gets boring as long as you are going along with it. This is not to say that it couldn't have been done better - it was too long, it did draw things out at times and the plot is well worn but it still just about works.The cast don't really do a great deal to help the material either; despite the fact that there are some pretty big names here. Costner plays against type (at the time) pretty well and is able to do enough to win over the audience before then switching it on us. Lowther is quite good and manages to avoid the cute-kid clichs that usually come with this type of film. Most of the interesting cast though, are in the trailer are and given little time to work. Eastwood is a good character but he limits his own impact and focuses the film on Butch; likewise Dern, Whitford and so on are left hanging in what is very much a side issue.Overall this is an OK film but it is hard to really get excited by it. It treads a very familiar road and does it without spark or flair; although it is still interesting and delivered in an engaging style. The big name cast don't have much to do but Costner does do a good job with a well-written character who reveals his issues and drives gradually across the film. Tighter and with more spark would have been better but it still is enjoyable enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's one of those movies where the bad guy is the good one and the good guy looks like the bad one. Just look at how it was forced the whole "Butch isn't a bad guy, he is just misunderstood" while the "good guy" with the rifle shots him and kills him in the end, it was intended to be looked to the people as the "cold and merciless killer who killed an unarmed man" That was so poorly doneAlso i didn't like it that much how the kid developed a friendship with him. But i guess the logical answer to that is he developed a Stockholm syndromeAlthough Kevin Costner did a good job in his role and the movie had it's good moments of suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great film. Unusual to see Eastwood taking a back seat in a movie: Costner took the lead and did a good job with it. In fact, all the players were good, maybe because they had such a fine production with which to work. I can see why Costner's character wound up in the pen; he made no effort to travel incognito - pretty stupid for such a high I.Q. Speaking of opacity, how did that igmo pulling the airstream get to be a Texas Ranger? Are the police actually that brainless?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Story but Falls Flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Perfect World is a great and interesting story with massive potential. The plot and characters are meaningful and have great potential, while Costner's character in particular is complex. On the one hand, he is a violent criminal, yet at the same time he can be sympathetic even if one cannot truly like him. The development of his relationship with the boy, while the police are after him, is excellent and creates a much more thoughtful film than one that simply involves police after a bad kidnapper. On the one hand, the viewer cares about the boy and wants him rescued, yet at the same time he is not in the hands of a one-dimensional stock villain.Of the actors, Costner himself does a very good job (as he sometimes does!). He is believable and sympathetic and unlikable at the same time.The problem with the movie is that it's almost (not quite, but almost) ruined by Eastwood's typically careless and uninspired directing and general handling. One major problem, common with Eastwood-directed films, is that it's not quite convincing, a problem which appears to be a result not of the story or acting, but the directing, overall handling of the characters, details, etc. Here, this is particularly true with respect to the time period. The directing also fails to make the most of the potential emotional impact. As usual, Eastwood's directing shows technical proficiency but nothing more: no artistry, insufficient attention to details, etc. Had this been handled by a different director, it could have been a truly great film. As it is, it is worth watching but kind of falls flat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Makes Jehovah's Witnesses Look Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie I was very very disappointed. I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses. Why did you make it look like the boy who got kidnapped that was one of Jehovah's Witnesses couldn't do anything? Like, he couldn't go on a roller coaster or eat cotton candy? Jehovah's Witnesses are not condemned to eat cotton candy unless that person is allergic to it. And what in the world is this thing in the movie about Roller Coasters? Who on this planet told you Jehovah's Witnesses can't ride roller coasters? Jehovah's Witnesses are not condemned for going on thrill rides in theme parks unless that person has a fear of heights. And, also Jehovah's Witnesses don't steal! In the movie the boy stole a costume. The whole movie makes it look like Jehovah's Witnesses are condemned to do fun things like going on rides and eating treats.Jehovah's Witnesses go on rides and eat cotton candy just like any other person on this planet. And, just because Jehovah's Witnesses don't celebrate any holidays doesn't mean we don't get presents or have any fun. Jehovah's Witnesses don't need holidays to get presents we have as much fun as any other kid even though we don't celebrate any holidays. This is a movie I would and will not ever recommend. Next time find out and research what Jehovah's Witnesses really believe and condemn before spreading negative lies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conflicting Feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Perfect world" is the kind of a motion picture that lefts me grappling with some rather conflicting feelings. I'm a huge fanatic when it comes to good old Mr. Eastwood and I've always admired him and his quite spectacular movies. Therefore it's always been a hard job to even say something bad about his flicks. It's also pretty difficult to claim this is a lousy film considering that it has an excellent acting (especially from C.E. himself) and it's a nice, firm and well-made work from Clint. I just don't like the most disappointing story. Why is it that whenever I see Dirty Harry Callahan torturing his victims or Josey Wales spitting on a forehead of a corpse I find it rather amusing and entertaining but when a movie tries to make adultery acceptable (like in "The Bridges of Madison County") or represents religion as the biggest enemy I find it much harder to approve. There's no denying it, "A Perfect world" is basically a good movie but nevertheless it's my least favorite of Eastwood's works of the 90's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ho hum... how dull can a movie get?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am getting so sick and tired of movie with guns, killings and elements that make me reach for the OFF switch, go find a good book and curl up and read....and in that way one doesn't get visually offended by a bunch of scenes that are tiresome and offensive to one's sensitivities, as this film is, having a sweet little boy being instructed how to point and shoot a gun. No, thanks...this has too much repetitive action that doesn't have the sort of characters and story to prompt me to watch any longer than I need to in order to know this is NOT my cup of tea! Some viewers may like violence but I think we get enough of that in real life without watching it on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mediocre acting, bad editing, but interesting plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Badly edited, mediocre acting from the adults, great acting from the boy!Butch's bribe tactics/ manipulation were portrayed both as a liberation AND as a desperate attempt to get the Boy to adore his captive- this gray area is very interesting. Butch's "intelligence" shows in how he is able to use the Boy's suppressed desires to work for him- trick or treating for food, for example. Ironically it is also the costume that makes the boy recognizable to the authorities!Butch could have had the Boy doing real bad stuff but in the end the Boy finds independence from his mother (stealing costume) and also from Butch when he shoots Butch to protect the Cleve's family- the ultimate evolution for the boy, I suppose. Underdeveloped much of the time/ over played the rest of the time!! Dialogue between Butch and the Boy was unbelievable often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>wow. probably the only thing i agree with liberalsit's about crime. criminals are not always criminals.. this movie is actually not completely liberal. but still neo liberalism biased.directed by Clint Eastwood, one of the filthiest neocons in Hollywood, his movies often pro war, combined with "patriotism" and racial Marxism. the worst type today i can imagine is Clint Eastwood type, promote race mixing, social destruction. meanwhile strongly pro war and pro violence.the movie is OK, nothing special ,it can be made in any country, France Italy, Russia , japan technically speaking. i have no comments on its filmaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie made me realize that I would be happier in the Fifth Circle of Hell. Not only is this movie slow-paced, shallow, PC, and about 30 minutes too long, it also had to have some of the worst acting I have ever witnessed...well, with the possible exception of "Jade."Eastwood and his posse spend the entire movie chasing after a criminal in a trailer and glugging coffee. And of course the sniper from the government just HAS to be a jerk. Costner is an average actor who gets by on his looks, and would never play a real bad guy. The "bad guy" he plays here is about as dangerous and offensive as my last bowel movement, which isn't saying much.And Laura Dern...this woman not only looks like a collie, but she seems to have to let out a shrill collie-like scream in every movie she's in, like Jurassic Pork. If she does that in another movie, I'll be reaching for my shotgun.And why would she scream when Costner gets shot? She's a criminologist who should be glad that he's been blasted. I think it's because Costner is playing the bad guy and therefore all women must have the hots for him.Eastwood sleepwalks through this one, too. He has a look on his face like someone just told him Sondra Locke is suing him again. I hate to pick on kids, but I'm surprised a 7-year-old Jehova's Witness would care about the size of his "unit."</fullReview>
